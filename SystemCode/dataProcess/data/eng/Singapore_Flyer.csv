,,Amazing giant wheel experience,5,,Amazing experience with full city view in night . while climbing the stairs one gets many color full and light ful things on way . Go for it !!,,,
,,A little bit boring,3,,"We went to this flyer and the view from up there is beautiful, However, the ride is about 40 mins and it can get quite boring after some time.",,,
,,Not impressed with the views vs price,2,,The views were okay and they just don't do justice with the entry fee. I'd suggest you to drop this and better go on Marina Sands viewing deck for much better views.,,,
,,Breathtaking views!,5,,"Went at night for a different experience. Ride took around 30 minutes long. There was a queue when we went but it moved pretty fast. Once at the top, views of the Singapore skyline are breathtaking, especially at night with all the city lights. Nice to know that you could actually book a capsule and have dinner with friends/family while admiring the Singapore skyline",,,
,,Iconic,4,,The best of the region on the birds eye view of singapore and as far as Indonesia.. One time will enough to blow you away.,,,
,,45 minutes,5,,It takes 45 minutes to make a circle and its worthy. place to visit after 10pm so that you can see the whole Singapore skyline during night,,,
,,"Fly, Fly, Flyer",5,,"Asia鈥檚 largest giant observation wheel lives up to its name. It鈥檚 awesome and the views are amazing. Panaromic views of the Beauty of Singapore.

It moves at a nice pace giving you ample time to breathe in the beauty.

165 metres above sea level, there鈥檚 a feast of iconic landmarks that you see. There are 4 pads in the capsule which tells details about various landmarks.",,,
,,Top of the world in Singapore,5,,Enjoy this very well know and special attraction when you visit Singapore as you have an excellent view of all that you can survey. Enjoy... it is amazing.,,,
,,Night time is magical,5,,"Very expensive for a family of 4, but the views are worth it. Went at night time and even though our cabin was full, it was well air conditioned and had plenty of bench seats. The views at the top are amazing. Trip takes about 30 minutes. Don鈥檛 bother paying for your photo that they ask you to have in front of a green screen before the ride. The quality is not very good and photos are quite expensive. Gift shop at the end is not too bad, lots of souvenirs to buy.",,,
,,Family return Visit after years,5,,"A family return visit to the Flyer so that my youngest granddaughter could see the city -this time in the daytime ( years previous we done an evening flight). We all were ver pleased with the flight as we could see what had been built in the intervening years.
Everything regarding the flight was first class regarding cleanliness and safety

remember to get your tickets on the ground floor not as we did get upstairs and then to go down again.

the only down thing was that we had to have our photos taken - after the flight we bought two copies of two photos and were told we could download the others from a website - this I was not able to do and chasing the company they did not help at all

My son eventually retrieved them by knowledge that normal people do not have at their fingertips",,,
,,"Expensive, but not crowded",3,,"We did the Flyer one weekend evening around 5:30. We had read that it was more crowded later, but even when we left the area after walking the grounds, there was only a few people waiting in line. We had four in our family, and had a pod all to ourselves, which was great for seeing everything. That said, the view isn't as good as others in the area (Marina Bay Sands, Level 33, etc) and it is quite expensive for a half hour ride.",,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Did the night time ride this year and it was jaw dropping. The views were wonderful from the top of the wheel......the city lights made for great photos.
The cabins are clean and spacious and the ride so smooth.
Defiantly do this ride.
Annette and David (Aust)",,,
,,No sky diver at the Flyer,4,,"Great view of the Central Business District and of Singapore skyline in general makes the high price worth it. During the month of Singapore National Day, a promotion makes it a steal for senior locals in possession of a PAssion card, at just S$1.90 per ticket.",,,
,,Highlight of my time in Singapore,5,,I debated long and hard if I should go on this as I hate heights but my fear soon disappeared when I got on board. Magnificent view all over the city and beyond from the wheel. It takes 30 minutes to do a full circle. Wished I had done this early on my trip. I went on it during the day which was great but was also told I should have gone back and seen the city at night. Make sure you do this while in Singapore.,,,
,,Masterpiece Architecture - Spectacular view,5,,"You will be having spectacular view of singapore. Capsules having lot of dine and premium facilities (if u opt for). You can have view of near by indonesian islands too. seeing singapore from 165 meters tall (Awesome, is it???)",,,
,,Who wonders: beautiful view!,5,,Of course you have a wonderful view from the flyer. We had booked with Singapore Sling and almost no waiting time. A must in Singapore.,,,
,,Cool views but...,3,,"A lot of Singapore attractions are based on the views you can get from them, the higher the better. Singapore Flyer was expensive and not easy to get to - and offered a view I had already seen.

I have done the Vegas High Roller, and I will be doing the London Eye next month, so I guess I keep going to giant ferris wheels -- that said, its not a necessity. If you can get a sweet bargain, go ahead, but it's a long walk from public transport and usually a long wait in line, and its a 45 minute ride. I don't regret doing it - but I wouldn't have regretted skipping it and saving the time/money either.",,,
,,Great experience,5,,"Spacious cabins, smooth movement and jaw dropping views. Easy access by MRT. Clear directions make it easy. Best way to view Singapore.",,,
,,Nothing spectactular,3,,"We went to the singapore flyer. The first 5 mins of the ride is Ok, after the 5 mins things become boring. Many people clamped into one cabin",,,
,,Fascinating Attraction,5,,"A fascinating attraction and a landmark in Singapore with a hieght of 165 meters that let you discover the whole city from ubove. It is a piece of architecture and we enjoyed our trip in the morning that lets you view and take photos for the lovely Singapore city.

The trip last for 30 minutes and the capsules are very large and air-conditioned. Please note that the nearest underground station is bit far and requires at least 15 minutes walking and could be bothersome during humid weather.",,,
,,Fabulous views,4,,"During July we went to Singapore and Indonesia.
Singapore is an amazing place to stay, and the Singapore Flyer is brilliant, it is a bit bigger than the London eye and better set up. The views are fabulous, we went during the day but I think an evening fly would be better, to see Gardens by the Bay at night from there would be amazing.
Would recommend if you are there.",,,
,,Mesmerising,5,,Simply splendid. The views from the capsule is so captivating. The Flyer is a must do in Singapore. We had the luxury of getting a private cabin for the 6 of us and it was very memorable. Highly recommend!,,,
,,Magical experience.,5,,"My 2nd time on the Flyer and, by pure chance, our ride coincided with sunset and we were able to see the supertree light show this time. We were granted a wonderful view of Singapore lights. Our son is now keen to complete his trifecta and ride the London Eye, having been on the Melbourne Star earlier in the year. I am sure the Singapore Flyer will outclass the other 2.Having ""flown"" daytime, and night time, I would strongly recommend a night time view.",,,
,,Great in the evening!,5,,We chose to go on the Flyer in the evening literally 3/4 hour before it closed. There were no queues and we walked straight on. It was great and the staff were very polite and helpful. Couldn't fault it at all and fabulous views,,,
,,"Not to be missed - great fun, great views!",5,,"We love a good 'Ferris Wheel' and the Singapore Flyer did not disappoint! There was no waiting at all (we visited in the middle of the day) & it was easy to find our way there & onto the Flyer. Once on, the ride was very comfortable, it was clean & the view was absolutely incredible!",,,
,,Flyer,3,,Nice view but a bit over-priced for what you get. Similar to the view from the Marina Bay Sands hotel.,,,
,,It was a great experience so far.,4,,The view was fantastic and the air condition was also nice. The weather was also perfect so that we can see far. So Its a must try!!! thank you.,,,
,,Simple to use,4,,"Simple to use, I can really recommend this package. Nice activity when visiting Singapore. . I had a good time here.",,,
,,singapore flyer and gardens by the bay combo,5,,fairly recommended just because of redeeming the tickets for gardens by the bay at singapore flyer area before going to gardens. but redeeming is very easy. nice to have a gelato while waiting for singapore flyer,,,
,,The Singapore Flyer was great,5,,We enjoyed the views and the the little garden and fish pounds were added bonu.We could walk to the Garden by the bay from Singapore Flyer and loved the trees and the flower and cloud forest.over all a good day.,,,
,,Me and my parents had a super enjoyable day here!!!,5,,They have a love for flowers and gardens and this was the perfect place for them!! This place is magical!!,,,
,,We could come back and visit them later,5,,"We thought that we could get the ticket at the cloud forest and flower dome counter but apparently not, we need to take the mrt to the gellatismo counter, the only place, to get all the tickets. There will be a stuff sitting on the picnic table distributing tickets. Luckily, cloud forest and flower dome are open date ticket.",,,
,,This is the best package deal and turns out to be cheaper.,5,,Go for the Singapore flyer in the morning as you can get really good pictures of all the buildings around. Its an amazing view from top up. The ride is 30minutes and after that you can claim your free icecream since the weather is really hot Gardens by the bay is one of the best gardens one will ever see..,,,
,,"Fly high, great view.",4,,We have good experience with flyer. It has one of the biggest cabin we have ever been in. The wheel is very big so we can go high but still feel safety. It take about 30 minutes for each time so you have enough time to enjoy the whole view of Singapore highlights. We like it.,,,
,,The highest flyer in the Asia,4,,"This flyer is the highest in Asia and second highest in the world.

The best time for having a flyer ride is on weekdays and before sunset when you can see the day and also after sunset to see the city at night . To me , both are beautiful.

So, we got there at 6pm as the sunset was at 7:12pm. We purchased our tickets . The price of each ticket is S$33 for adults and S$21 for kids or child upto 12 years old. Each capsule or cabin's capacity is max 28 persons but normally when there is no queue , you can have your privacy.

The duration of flyer is 30 minutes .so, I recommend you to split your time in two 15 minutes : 15 minutes before sunset starts to see the day and places in the city. And second 15 minutes for after sunset to see the beauty of the night.

For example : if the sunset is 7:15. Then, you better get on board at 7 pm and get off at 7:30 pm.

Also, there are there screens giving you necessary information regarding the surroundings.

For those who are acrophobe, do not worry at all. You can not feel the hight when you are in the capsule. It is much safer than being on the plane. Moreover, the speed is very low and you can not feel the move and rotation at all.

There is a coffee shop under the flyer and Indian restaurant at the first floor and some shops .

To me , it was a good experience.

I have another tip for those who want to make a plan for the restime of the day. After finishing your ride,follow the river and go over the helix bridge to see the magnificent scenery of the city overlooking Marina bay and merlion. ..",,,
,,Worst of money,2,,The views seen up from here can be seen from anywhere and hence don鈥檛 see a profit in wasting 30 dollar per person . Actually it鈥檚 going in loss and the Govt might soon close thsi attraction as no one pays to go up there except few tourist,,,
,,Fantastic View,5,,Visited on a Friday evening & it was pretty quiet - no queue so a fast route through- carriage was pretty empty but imagine during peak times there will be twice as many people in !! Great to give an overall view of the city & get ones bearings - pretty reasonably priced at $33 per adult- last about 30 minutes- its a must do on a visit to Singapore,,,
,,For the Best views of Singapore,5,,"This attraction is easy to get to and, like the ones in London and Melbourne, offer a great ride and excellent views of the surroundings. The ride is 30 minutes and when we went there, not too overcrowded.",,,
,,Singapore visit,5,,The two days I spent in Singapore were totally worth it! The Flyer viewed from the bridge at night is a site to behold!,,,
,,Great View,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is like the London Eye its a large wheel with air conditioned gondalas. The flyer costs about $33sgd for the basic ride which takes about 40 mins. It is well worth doing either by day or night, during the day you get to look around the city and the ships anchored in the south china sea waiting to come into port. At night you have a great view of the city and the river all lit up which makes for some good photo opportunities.

If you are a F1 motor racing follower you will see part of the circuit leading into the pit lane. You ca also walk a small part of the track entering the pit lane and walking down as far as the start / Fininsh line.

Well worth a visit.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"My kids enjoyed Singapore Flyer. A must try activity when visiting Singapore, enjoy the spectacular view of Singapore at night.",,,

,,Singapore in the sky,5,,Hallo from the sky!!! This modern comfortable Flyer like a cabin takes u high! With air conditioner goes well!馃馃槵,,,
,,Wow what a view,5,,"Fantastic view, hint, get there early, opens at 830am. We had the pod to ourselves, well worth the money, local train station only 5 minutes away.",,,
,,Worth doing with great views.,4,,"Standing 165 meters tall lasting 30 minutes, it commands great views of Marina Bay with a view back at Singapore directly above Pitt Straight of the F1 Grand Prix race track.
Other than bu taxi which is very economical, both Hop-On-Hop-Off buss services stop at the Singapore Flyer. (The Singapore Eye).",,,
,,Different perspective,4,,"The view from up here is great you can see all of singapore from the highest point.
Of cause if you're not good with heights then this isnt for you, if youve got a couple of hours to spare then this should be on your list, its super easy to get to on mrt.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer awesome,5,,Awesome view of the city. Very safe and very comfortable ride Enjoy unlimited A life time unlimited expectations vs real reality...,,,

,,Nice Views,5,,I was excited because it is 165 meters tall. I took the nice and excellent pictures on the flyer. It was good spending half an hour.,,,
,,Beautiful place,5,,"Well like everything else in Singapore, this attraction is also beautiful and picturesque. We were short of time hence couldn't enjoy the flyer ride. But the surrounding area is also beautiful.",,,
,,Memorable views,5,,This was my first time on a ferris wheel this huge. I was afraid and excited at the same time. The flyer provided us views that were magnificent. We were there during the sunset. Beautiful ...,,,
,,Awesome view all around the city,5,,Gives you a great look around the city in all directions including out over the gardens area. Takes about 30 minutes to do one revolution. Well worth it and about 10 mins walk from the Merlion area.,,,
,,A great dining experience rotating twice on the Flyer with fireworks included,5,,"e booked the dining experience on the Singapore Flyer and although relatively expensive it proved to be worth every dollar. Right from arriving and being greeted in the lounge area, escorted into our dining cabin - 5 x tables for couples. The waitress was excellent looking after everyone extremely well. The food was well prepared and served - we had the western fixed menus of lamb and fish - cooked to perfection.
Highlight of the night was when at the top of the Flyer on our 2nd rotation the rehearsal of the National Independence Day fireworks went off - very spectacular for all those in our cabin !! :-) Tip - make sure you order your drinks [with 2nds if required] as once you are on board there is no 2nd drinks ordering].",,,
,,A pleasant way to spend a half an hour,5,,"We joined the flyer from a trip we took on the Hop on Hop off bus trip around Singapore and thoroughly enjoyed it . The view from the top was spectacular with different panoramas being The Garden By The Bay,Singapore鈥檚 CBD and the vastness of the Harbour with literally hundreds of large ships sitting at anchor.
Well worth it",,,
,,Excellent view,5,,"It's worth the price, excellent view best time to visit is sunset time. you get both day and night views of the city.",,,
,,This is a must when in Singapore,5,,"It was a spectacular view from the top. You can see everything. We did it during the day, but I would think at night would be amazing too. Either way, it is a must in Singapore.",,,
,,A Must-See Attraction,5,,"This will give you a very nice view of the city. It is good whether you do it in the morning , afternoon or night, depending on the kind of view that you want.",,,
,,Great View,5,,We enjoyed the 30 minute ride and had the chance to see a thunderstorm over the Ocean. Also the view over the city was amazing. Sadly it was very cloudy. I would recommend doing it on a sunny day!,,,
,,Wonderful experience,5,,Whole family enjoyed our time at the Flyer. Staff very helpful while the time on Flyer was very enjoyable,,,
,,Awesome view,5,,My son loved the Singapore Flyer. We went as part of the Changi Recommends tour. It had been raining on and off but was only sprinkling on and off during our tour. We were fortunate as this meant that we could ride the Flyer. The tour guide got our tickets while we relaxed after our walk there. Because of the rain there were not as many people waiting to ride. There was a wedding party and it was cute to see the couple so happy. We were fortunate that they allowed our tour party of 6 a car to ourselves. Looking out we could see many of the attractions of Singapore and out towards the ocean. When we got to the top we could look all around us as the view was not obstructed by any buildings. Would ride again as it was fun and a smooth ride. Might not be as fun if it was crowded but great first experience on the Flyer.,,,
,,Nice but...,3,,It was nice I wont disagree but I went during the day which made me expose to the Sun's Ray. Should visit only during evenings for the cool light effects which was a miss for me. I enjoyed. Get your tickets online.,,,
,,"Beautiful view, worth the visit",4,,Going in the morning we didn't have too much of a queue. The way in/out of the flyer is easy. The views are beautiful and there's a useful ipad to explain to you what you're seeing. A nice outing.,,,
,,Must do experience,5,,"The 30 minute ride on the flier is a nice peaceful way to get a great view of the harbour area. It is surprising to see the vast number of ships out in the Singapore straight, the interactive screens explain what you are looking at so it鈥檚 easy to get the lay of the land, each pod hold 28 people so the line moves quickly. We went early and didn鈥檛 have to wait, noticed it got busier as we were leaving as lots of your groups go there.",,,
,,Great View of the city,5,,Try the eve view around 7 pm so you can see half day and half night view as the flyer goes around. Also try to go on a weekday so you dont get much crowd in your capsule.,,,
,,Bucket list tick for us,5,,"Loved this half hour, beautiful views in air conditioning. Highly recommend doing this, we really enjoyed",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,It provides excellent view of entire singapore... breathtaking views from the Flyer.. must visit iconic hotspot for all people visiting Singapore.... !!,,,
,,Great views day or night,5,,"I have been on the flyer both during the say and the evening and if you have flown into town with Singapore airways take your boarding card and show it to the ticket sales assistant for a healthy discount.

You can buy food and drink in the surrounding ticket sales area before or after your flight on the flyer and you can use the hop on hop off bus to travel here, again using your Singapore Airways boarding card for a discount.

It's certainly worth the time and the money to do this.",,,
,,Pathetic experience,1,,It was worst experience to visit this place. Poor customer service.its overpriced and long queues and humid,,,
,,360 View of Singapore in One Hour,5,,"The Flyer takes you round to give 360 degree view of the town so beautiful. Sit, stand and relax in air conditioned cabins and enjoy the panoramic view.",,,
,,Offers a great views,4,,"Can be a bit pricey but worth the view. Even though it was a cloudy day it still offered a great view of the city. It wasn't busy so we didn't have to wait. It's easy to find. Lots of shops and food court in the plaza. Pods are sealed and cool, can be a bit cramped for tall individuals.",,,
,,馃帰 Fun 馃帰 Fun 馃帰 Fun!,5,,"I definitely recommend this place if you are in the mood for a little adventure. This place is ideal for solo travelers, family 馃應 or friends. A nice view from Ce La Vi 57th floor.",,,
,,Amazing 360 degree view of singapore,5,,Amazing 360 degree view of Singapore skyline from the Singapore Flyer. As it goes at a slow pace one can get excellent photographs from above. It takes approximately 45 mins to complete one round. Its a must do activity when you are in Singapore.,,,
,,Fabulous views panoramic views.,5,,A great experience. Fantastic photo opportunities with a commentary telling all about the area. Pick a clear sunny day for the best views and although only about 30 minutes - well worth the money.,,,
,,Awesome view of Singapore skyline!,4,,"Lovely view of the skyline. Try to go in the evening when you can enjoy the view before sunset as well as after sunset. Since the flyer moves slowly, you can capture good and memorable pictures.",,,
,,Great way to see the skyline and highlights of Singapore!,5,,"Upon arriving in Singapore, it was too early to check in the hotel. It also was simple enough with the sightseeing after a 16 hour flight from New York so we visited the Flyer.. While it was not cheap the views were fantastic. There is also an interactive TV explaining the city skyline and giving you a basic history of Singapore.The cars had benches holding 28 passengers and had fans to move the air around. Perfect overview before doing serious touring. Great way to get your bearings of the City.",,,
,,Sherin Nafie,3,,"The view from up high was lovely, but one can still enjoy it from any bar restaurant on a high floor in a sky scraper, for eg. level 33 bar & restaurant or Marina Bay Sands hotel bars in levels 55 & 57. I found the informational videos about Singapore places to visit on the Singapore flyer quite interesting though.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Just what you would expect. Views are good, waiting time at 8.30pm on a Sunday night was minimal and fuss seemed to be less than London eye even though it is 30 metres higher.
Been in one wheel been on a them all I felt. The kids can never get enough",,,
,,Great Views.,4,,"No surprises here - a great way to see Singapore and take photos. We didn鈥檛 have to wait at all, straight on and straight off. It took about 30 - 35 minutes.",,,
,,Astounding views,5,,"We had a fantastic time on the flyer.
No queues on the day we visited. Time approx 3.30pm I鈥檓 the afternoon.

The cost was reasonable for 30
Minutes of viewing. An auto tour iPad was in the cabin and informed you of the landmarks etc throughout the journey.

The cabin can hold up to 28 people but we were lucky and only had 4 in total on the day making it easy to move around and take photos .

I would recommend to everyone",,,
,,Aesthetic,5,,Really enjoy the aesthetics of the Singapore Flyer along with the other landmarks. It is a good place to chill and also take photos.,,,
,,Very disappointed because of continuous jabber from loudspeakers inside the cabin,1,,"Very disappointed because of continuous jabber from loudspeakers inside the cabin. It's just nonsense - I came with my girlfriend to have a pleasure... and ALL THE TIME unpleasant, annoying, troublesome voice of a woman sounded from loudspeakers. Very loud voice. Stupid jokes and intonations. I'm not a dull schoolboy, I did not agree with that brainwashing.",,,
,,Great Views of Singapore,5,,Very exciting experience to have photographic views of singapore. Try to get there as early as possible in the morning or around sunset to capture great views. The interactive tablets are very much informative. A must on the to do list when in Singapore for the first time.,,,
,,Amazing engineering design,5,,"An interesting and rewarding experience. You should go into the sunset as the most beautiful.
You can go there by MRT, get off at Promenade station, walk about 500m to arrive. On the way you will see a cabin identical to the cabins on the Flyer on the ground decorated as a banquet room
I bought ticket online is cheaper: Adult 36$ SG. Child 26$ SG",,,
,,Cool Attraction,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a fantastic way to see Singapore from the sky, each go lasts around half an hour so you have plenty of time to enjoy the view.",,,
,,Amazing Experience,5,,"Make sure you do this activity in the evening. The closest MRT station being Promenade. At 165 metres, its an amazing experience",,,
,,good view over city hall,3,,"Singapore flyer lets you view the top of city hall where you can have a majestic view of the whole area. This ferris wheel concept is very modern and family friendly, however the pricing is abit high. So i would recommend to buy the tickets when its on sale or discounted.",,,
,,Unique City Views,5,,Beautiful Views of Fantastic Singapore City . No waiting time even you can have a hole cabin to your family or company,,,
,,Magnificent view of Singapore,5,,"Singapore Flyer - a must do activity & Experience Singapore in a memorable way. Enjoy a magnificent view of Singapore; Skyscrapers, Skyline, Business District, Hotels, etc. A calm & enjoyable ride 馃馃幎馃帀馃馃帄馃嚫馃嚞",,,
,,Not To That Of Expectation,3,,"Flyer is average according to me. Very slow and not so thrilling. In total 30mins , we all feel bored withing 15mins. If you want to say that you travelled in Flyer,just go.",,,
,,There are better places to get a view of the city,2,,"If you have a goal to be on each flyer in each capital city, then this is a good reason to step on.
If you like to have a view of Singapore, I know better places . It is a highlight of the city, but I would not dare for it.",,,
,,Good one but over priced,4,,"Good experience but considering the short duration it's over priced , should go with children , but if you are an adult trust be you have the option of of watching the same view from many Singapore buildings
Good part is you never feel height sickess as it moves very slow",,,
,,Singapore flyer,4,,"Would recommend as it鈥檚 a cool way to view Singapore from above. It was a cloudy rainy day when we went on, I imagine the view would be better on a brighter day.",,,
,,Private Champagne Flight was a fabulous choice for our group,5,,"Having been on the Flyer in March 2016, suggested to our group that we should include it as part of a friend's birthday celebrations.

We booked the Premium Champagne Private Capsule/Mo毛t & Chandon Champagne Flight for our party of seven and it was a great choice from the 鈥榤eet and greet鈥?to being shown into the cabin. We were taken to a VIP reception area to book in and then to a lounge before boarding. There is one glass of Moet and some very tasty chocolates included which were enough for the 30-min 鈥榝light鈥?

Upon leaving we headed back to the lounge (which we realised was open to the public) for more drinks (at our own cost) and out onto the balcony with a fabulous view towards the Sky Gardens at sunset.

A very good option for a group of friends and, even if you do not book the Moet flight, check out the public lounge for sunset drinks with a fabulous view.",,,
,,Fabulous way to see Singapore,5,,"We went @ night the lazer show @ Marina Bay sands Hotel was on so we had the added bonus of seeing the light show from above, plenty of room in the pods able to walk around & take in the views. Worth a visit.",,,
,,Just woow,5,,Wow. One of the finest Water Fountain shows in the World. My favorite one at least I can say. Would love to come back here again.,,,
,,Great 360 degree views,5,,Really get a fantastic 360 degree view of the whole of Singapore including F1 race track etc. A must in my book.,,,
,,Great sights from great heights,5,,"Situated at one corner of Marina Bay, the Singapore Flyer takes you on a wonderful 30 journey over the most impressive Skyline of this beautiful city. The cabins are air conditioned with 360 screens inside explaining what you're seeing outside. The views are amazing and on clear days you can see not only s Singapore, but Indonesia and into Malaysia as well. Definitely worth going on",,,
,,Singapore from a Birds Eye,4,,This is a nice ride in an enclosed cabin. No fear of any dizziness or nausea. Ride is absolutely safe.,,,
,,Nice Views,4,,"We went early in morning just after opening and there was no line or wait. The tickets are a bit high for a 30 min loop around but we did get some taken off with AAA card.
It was so empty we had a car by ourselves and the screens were really cool at giving interesting information of the sites.",,,
,,See the sights of Singapore from up high,4,,"Took a day ride. No queues surprisingly and we walked straight on. Comparable in price to the London Eye, but taller. Look out across the bay to the cruise terminal and all the moored ships. Look down onto the F1 track. Some great scenery. Little disappointing that it closes so early (10pm), but I suppose if the demand is not there.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,4,,"Amazing Ariel view of whole Singapore ....very comfortable ...it takes approximately 45 mins to complete one round. If you are with a big group of 18-20 person , you can book one trip. Great experience",,,
,,Good for tourists,3,,"If you want to see the Singapore cityscape, this is the place to be. Just know that besides the Ferris wheel, there鈥檚 really nothing else to do there. Another great place to see the cityscape would be marina bay sands. But that鈥檚 way more pricey.",,,
,,Good ... but not the Best !!!,3,,"a good experience, but too slow. One circle takes 30 minutes to complete. Would prefer MBS Skypark to have better look of the city.",,,
,,Simply amazing,5,,Flyer is almost amazing while viewing it on all 4 sides from the flyer.one round takes abt half hr.Must visit place while visiting singapore.,,,
,,New experience in the sky. Correct way to view Singapore thru an eagle eye,5,,Wholesome experience. Enjoyed thoroughly. One can njoy if the group is of 8-10persons. What a beautiful view of Singapore. Beautiful and elegant. If anyone has time they must also enjoy the dinner in the flyer. Duration of ride is approx 30minutes. It is just above the formula 1 night race track.,,,
,,Fun,5,,The ride was really fun. Scenery was magnificent. 10/10 reccomend. Rmb to book tickets in advance to avoid long queues.,,,
,,Great views,5,,Offered great views of the city and moved slowly to give you time to enjoy the ride. You also had to board and alight while it was moving.,,,
,,My favorite photograph subject,5,,"This is my favorite structure to take photographs. It鈥檚 pretty grand, right? Best time to see it is almost sunset.",,,
,,The Champagne Flight is COMPLETELY worth it!!,5,,"We knew when we went to Singapore that we wanted to go on the Singapore Flyer, and it did not disappoint!

In an effort to book ahead of time and avoid any possible lines, we booked the Champagne Flight. My wife and I were able to check in early and wait for our flight time in the air-conditioned lounge. We were then escorted to the car, a private car with Champagne and chocolate! It was just the two of us, watching the sunset during our entire 30-minute ride. The views are incredible.

We aren鈥檛 sure that it would have always been just the two of us, had others booked the Champagne Flight at the same time, but we were lucky enough to have a private ride. We would highly recommend this to any couples wishing to enjoy the Singapore Flyer!",,,
,,Oh Yeah! Great Scenery.,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is an observation wheel with cabs that hold 20+ occupants. It is a fantastic way to enjoy a bird's eye view of this beautiful city and snap some great photos. Singapore is a city of lights, so the night time ride would probably be great. We used the subway to get to the Flyer from our hotel and the directional signs were easy to follow. The walk from the subway station to the Flyer is a bit long for individuals with mobility issues. This is especially true if the weather is hot and humid, but you can see the wheel immediately upon exiting the subway station. When we arrived at the Flyer boarding station, we walked a moderate distance to the jetway but were told we had to go back downstairs to purchase the tickets and return to the jetway. Ugh! No food or beverages are allowed on the Flyer, which is why the cabs are so clean, so you must discard any snacks or sodas prior to entering the jetway. Since it wasn't busy and we were quite hot, we took our time and we were the only occupants in the cab. It was eerily quiet and a smooth step onto the air conditioned cab. The ride costs about S$30 and lasts about 30 minutes. It's not exciting or thrilling but it provides an excellent view of the city from way up there. I would recommend this attraction for families with children as well as the elderly. But there are many other exciting things to do in Singapore for young and fit individuals.",,,
,,Great views of beautiful Singapore!,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is great for a birds eye view of Singapore. Getting our tickets proved to be the tricky part. We found the signage to be lacking and when we finally got to the ticket booth it was closed and we were re directed to another booth. With a bum knee and tired feet, this was not welcoming.",,,
,,Good,4,,It looks good when you enter the capsules.A capsule has a capacity of around 20-25 people so who comes with you is a fortune. It is very tall but not like London eye which has a great view.,,,
,,Enjoyed this,4,,"Came here on a Thursday night and got my money's worth. Clean, well-managed and well-executed, the Flyer affords visitors with a panoramic view of the entire city-state right by the Marina Bay complex. On par with similar wheels in London and Seattle, you're up there for approximately 20 minutes in a comfortable pod with a 360 view.

Nice facilities and a safe area make this a good destinations for families and solo travelers alike. There are always cabs there too, so no worry about having to schlep to the MRT. A nice way to wind down or kick off an evening by Marina Bay.",,,
,,We liked it,5,,"We had a pod with two other couples. We enjoyed the changing views as the pod slowly revolved. It was cool to see how many ships were in the harbor, the roads & tourist boats etc.
For us, the price was very reasonable (theres nothing like this where we are from).",,,
,,Great! Not Crowded. Air cond respite in mid-day,5,,"Like the other Singapore attractions, first-rate and not a touristy rip-off like it might be in so many other cities. Not crowded at all, mid-day on Sunday. Overlooks the Singapore F1 race track, cool! Recommended!",,,
,,What a view,5,,"If you wish to get a great view of the business district and the Marina Bay, you must have a go on the Flyer. Would suggest early morning if you don't like to queue but absolute best views at dusk, as the lights come on around Singapore",,,
,,Great trip,5,,"Easy to visit attraction, well organised and superb panoramic views of a great City. Would love to do of an evening next time",,,
,,Nice experience,5,,"Had a nice experience on the flyer.View from the flyer is quite stunning,can almost see all of the SIngapore.Try to visit in the evening just before the sunset so that you can enjoy both the day and night view.",,,
,,afraid of heights,5,,But my family loved the visit. The flyer has a laser light show to coordinate with the Marina Bay show so it was nice,,,
,,Singapore major attractions,5,,"Amazing place, no queue required. Very fast and efficient. Large capsule size. Beautiful view from top. You can even see Malaysia and part of Indonesia.

Good thing they don鈥檛 full the capsule unlike London eye where the capsules were crowded.

Must visit attraction. Very close to Garden by the bays.",,,
,,A must do for tourists,4,,"We went on a week day, so it was less crowded; still there were many tourists.

There are 28 cabins and only a maximum of 28 people are accommodated in each. The cabin is spacious, and has a running commentary of the places seen from above. Also there are 4 interactive tv screens showing the landmarks.

The flyer moved very slowly, 30 minutes per cycle; so slowly one does not even feel the movement.

Because the crowd was not large, the attendants allowed less people into each cabin; hence there was plenty of room for all of us, about 11 adults and 2 kids.

This was our first time, and we will definitely recommend visitors to this attraction. The ticket price was not prohibitive.",,,
,,A Singapore Must,5,,"At 165 metres high this is well worth the visit, the view you get during the 30 minute ride is astounding. The capsules are air conditioned and hold approximately 20 passengers, you have unobstructed views in all directions during the trip. There are great photo opportunities and a lot of information provided within the capsule.
This is a must do if you ever visit Singapore",,,
,,Nice view from the Sky,4,,"Nice view from the Singapore flyer, a little slow but good to experience. The car is very spacious and runs stable. We can enjoying Marina Bay and the River with most of the famous landmark can see under your eyes and take photos freely.",,,
,,Good view over Singapore,4,,A really goodood view over Singapore and surrounding areas with English commentary. 30 SGD per adult for 30 minutes ride.,,,
,,Great time spent,5,,On the wheel you get to see the whole city from above.The TV screens clearly identify all the city landmarks,,,
,,Slowly but surely,5,,"Great place to bring the family, especially if they鈥檙e seniors who prefer to be static! Albeit the occasional noisy children, it鈥檚 still worth a shot!",,,
,,Fly in the sky by Singapore Flyer,5,,Its really unforgettable experience to see Singapore from highest point of Flyer. Complete Singapore and almost all famous destination of Singapore saw from the flyer.,,,
,,Great views,4,,"Definitely one of the best places to get vast views of Singapore. We went during the day and could see into the distance. There are helpful videos and maps to make you see some relevant places. It goes slow so you can e joy. I think the entire journey takes somewhere around 30 minutes. The pods are huge and can fit a lot of people in, however, it may be less enjoyable if it is super crowded. Experience was more enjoyable for my parents than for me but a good family excursion.",,,
,,Top Marks,5,,"We did a city tour which included this attraction, and I must say it鈥檚 a must do. Smooth and easy and amazing panoramic views of one of the most impressive cities in the world . Will do again but next time at night.",,,
,,"Just a Ferris Wheel, not worth the money if you are staying at a tall hotel",3,,"It was expensive for what it was. I guess there are options to visit it with champagne and the like, but the standard is a ferris wheel with view over the coast, the Sands and the city.
We were there on a day with no waiting line, which was good.
The best part was grabbing icecream at the store right outside of the main building",,,
,,Not to be missed,5,,"A completely worthy experience. Not to be missed. Evening slot is the best time to be there. 6.30 preferably. Superb view of Singapore skyline. Lit up skyscrappers, the river, Marina Bay , gardens dome look amazing from the top. Spacious capsules with nice air conditioning and clear glasses through which u can click memorable pics. Worth every penny u spend on it.",,,
,,The best Ferris wheel ride is Asia!,4,,A technologically advance ferris wheel ride that can be a good elevated platform for viewing the whole of SG.Although it is not cheap but the whole experience is more than the value of the amount of the tickets.,,,
,,WoW,5,,Flying high 鉁ㄢ湪- Move a bit slow exited. We went at night can see very colorful light view. Love it. 馃憣鉁岎煄?,,,
,,Good to visit,4,,you will get to see the Citys panorama and is easy going for people who are scared with hights. Spacious and curteous staff. Eateries and shopping around the flyer,,,
,,Wonderful,4,,"The second biggest Ferris wheel in the world. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The views were spectacular. If you go to Singapore, don't miss out. Go!",,,
,,Great experience,5,,"Loved it. Speed is slow enough to take in the views. Clean pods, good size, views are 360. Good friendly staff service. Thank you.",,,
,,Nighttime view of the city,5,,A wonderful way to enjoy and appreciate the skyline view of the city at night! The staff were very friendly. Must do!,,,
,,What an amazing sight!,5,,Flying high - beautiful experience. Moves slowly (for the nervous) and makes for a spectacular photo opportunity. We went a night and loved it!,,,
,,$29.90 for 30min,4,,You can view Singapore's beautiful nig ht scene at here. Just pay $29.90 which took for around 30min. It's enjoyable.,,,
,,WOW,5,,"Its a wonderful ride, The view of Singapore city from this flyer was superb. If you visit Singapore don't miss this ride. And it cost you 33 Singapore $.",,,
,,Boasting The Best View of Singapore,5,,And indeed it does. We were lucky to be the first riders on the morning we went so the pod was ours to walk around and enjoy the most spectacular view of Singapore without noise or any jostling for the best photo position. The ride takes 30 minutes and provides a 360 degree view of this wonderful city out to the coast of Indonesia. The day was sunny but I think this attraction is worth the experience regardless of the weather. Next time I would like to book the evening champagne ride just to have the background of the city lights. The cost was $33 SGD per person. Worth every cent. Fabulous experience.,,,
,,Mini vacation,4,,"View of the whole Singapore - fantastic from the FLIER, and specially in evening when the whole city is live with lights",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,We loved the amazing views of Singapore! You are moving so slowly you don't even realise that you are moving! This is an absolute must do when visiting Singapore.,,,
,,Great nightview on singapore flyer,5,,"The singapore flyer is a must whilst in aingapore at night time before you leave if your visiting!! As it truly shows the beauty of the city lit up at night from over 160 meters in the air!
Very good price of $33SGD for adults tho they have special deals for abit more where you can have alcholic drinks on your ride(singapore slingers) and a few other packages.",,,
,,A must for visitors to our lovely island,4,,"The flyer is a must for visitors to Singapore, having lived here for a number of years now we always ensure that family and friends who come to see us go on it.
The best time to do this is actually half way through their visit, when they can identify buildings and areas they have seen for themselves when walking around.
It gives people a lovely birds eye view of the marina, the quays, from Jurong and beyond to the east coast. Looking north towards Bukit Timah you can see how Singapore has grown and developed into a modern metropolis sprinkled with beautiful old decorated town houses between the high rise towers.
Listen to the audio commentary as the wheel goes round, pointing out landmarks you may have missed or wondered what they are.
Definitely a good way to spend 30 minutes to see places that would otherwise take days to get around.
I鈥檓 sure you will enjoy it and it will certainly help visitors select places to see for themselves on foot later.",,,
,,Awesome,5,,"Must see! Please do not miss it. Especially the night view from Gardens of Bay! Do this visit by yourself & not in group! Singapore is easy to plan without group , which is what most tour operators force you to do!",,,
,,Singapore Flyer: Can give it a miss...,2,,"View of city skyline and areas around Marina Bay Sands. Taken twice - day and night. Preferred night view. Frankly Singapore Flyer is nothing to rave about with its many man-made structures if you have been to the London Eye with bird鈥檚 eye views of historical landmarks of the beautiful Thames River, Buckingham Palace, Parliament House.",,,
,,We went right on sunset - was perfect!,4,,Amazing views. We timed our visit for sunset. Great views. Very clean and easy to get to. Would book at restaurant if we ever went back. It looked amazing,,,
,,Awesome experience,5,,One should definitely experience flyer once.. we visited there on my babys first birthday and it was amazing.,,,
,,Excellent views of the city,5,,We booked the Singapore Flyer for late in the afternoon. It takes 30 minutes for a full rotation so you have plenty of time to take in the different views of Singapore. We opted for the Singapore Sling ticket and it was very special. Very helpful staff.,,,
,,Great views at night,4,,"Very popular during the evening as the view of the area is great. Particularly, Gardens by the Bay. Make sure you go on a clear day/evening.",,,
,,Reasonably nice way to see the city,3,,This flyer offers a lovely view of the city from all angles. It was lovely to see it all lit up at night. Its one of those tourist things that seem to be a must do when you are visiting Singapore.,,,
,,"See Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia from here",5,,"Flyer is a very slow moving ferri wheel which has closed transparent cabins with seats from which we can see the whole of Singapore, a part of Malaysia and Indonesia. The whole ride takes about 45 minutes to complete. The cabins are huge and they normally do not allow more than 5 - 6 people inside one cabin.",,,
,,Amazing view,5,,Amazing view of an amazing city. You won鈥檛 go wrong bringing visitors and guests here for a breathtaking view of the surrounding area.,,,
,,A fun ride.,4,,Great views of Sing and the Marina Bay sands. Not too expensive and easy to reach. Well worth a ride.,,,
,,The height is a thrill and the view at night is lovely,5,,The height is a thrill and the view at night is lovely. Worth the $33 given the expense of constructing such a huge machine.,,,
,,Amazing,5,,Its one of the most beautiful things to do and see while in Singapore. One of the most prominent and biggest landmarks in Singapore.,,,
,,This time at night!,5,,This was our second visit and this time we went in the evening to see the lights and it was amazing! Hardly a queue at 9pm and we were on our own in a cabin. Gorgeous lights. Could have easily stayed for another round,,,
,,Worth Doing,4,,"Essentially a large Ferris wheel allowing panoramic views across Singapore.

A little bit overpriced, but worth doing regardless.

Nice and cool inside which is a relief from the Singapore heat.

It鈥檚 a large structure so where it is is obvious, but there鈥檚 not much signage if you are walking there from the MRT.",,,
,,It was OK,3,,Post completing Garden by the Bay we directly headed to Singapore Flyer in the evening as it was 1 km from there. We entered Singapore flyer at 8 pm and wanted to see Singapore in the night. It was good experience however just worth once.,,,
,,"Singapore Flyer, Ferris wheel",5,,It's worth to ride because it has an air conditioner in a cabin so we can enjoy a cool and nice half hour trip. It's a nice view.,,,
,,Rather Fly,3,,"Singapore is beautiful The Singapore Flyer is Nice but, Expensive for what it is I would rather take a helecopter flight if it was available",,,
,,Awesome Experience,5,,Very nice family getaway with super awesome view from top. The Singapore Flyer is an excellent and wonderful family vacation destination.,,,
,,Great view at night to gardens by the bay,4,,"This is one the biggest flyers( if not the biggest), the cabins are wide and with glass, yo you can confortbaly walk along it and see differente views. We went at night and it was very nice, we had a great view of gardens by the bay and its light!
We went in september, and the line was short.

Please follow @mapamunditravel and if you find it helpful, please give me a vote as helpfulcolaborator = D thanks in advance",,,
,,Wow - great ride,5,,My husband went on the Flyer today and raved about it. He loved the whole experience . It took about 30 minutes and worth every penny.,,,
,,Amazing views of Singapore,5,,A bit pricey...but worth the view over the city. You can actually dine in the compartments while going ever so slowly at different angles. It is truly the very best view you can imagine and an awesome view,,,
,,Good fun,4,,A must do if going to Singapore but not sure of value for money. Excellent views of all the sites and great air-con!,,,
,,Day or Night ?,5,,"This is the choice you will need to consider.
After doing both day and night times on the London Eye and a person who take a lot of photos I prefer the night trip.
You will see plenty on the 鈥榝light鈥?which takes about 30 minutes, there are a few food outlets in the complex so you can eat before or after if you like. An easy walk from the Marina, day or night felt perfectly safe",,,
,,Good experience,4,,"Its a good one time experience where you view Singapore from the top. An ideal time to go for the 30 minutes ride is around 5.30pm so you get to see during the sunset and the lights in the evening.
Truly a spectacular view from the capsule.",,,
,,Flying view !!!,5,,It was an excellent weather when we visited. The 45 minutes ride is amazing. It gives 365* view of the Singapore !!!,,,
,,Stunning views,5,,A little out of the way but well worth the walk and the entry fee. We went first thing on a Sunday morning and were the only ones there so had a capsule to ourselves. Stunning views of the City and a far better experience than the Skypark at the neighbouring Marina Bay Sands.,,,
,,Last minute sight,5,,Our time was well booked before we got to Singapore but there was a bit of free time on the last morning there so off we went. It was interesting and you definitely got a good view of the city. Easily accessed by our wheelchair in the group.,,,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,"Though I did it in day time due to tight schedule, it was simply wonderful and breathtaking. Best moment was when we were at top of the flyer and the whole city skyline looks stunning..A must do, and if possible in night time",,,
,,Do it at night,5,,Breathtaking views of Singapore. I would take this at night. We enjoyed the lights and the views. The best was that there were no lines as well. This is a must if you only have a short time in Singapore. It gives you an idea of the density of the city,,,
,,Flying high,5,,Great way to capture views over Singapore. It gives you a great perspective of the city from a hight. Although the queue can be long it moves fast. Clean efficient and worth the price.,,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"I hate heights but managed this. It moves so slowly and doesn鈥檛 rock in the wind so it鈥檚 quite acceptable if you don鈥檛 look behind you at the wheel on the ascent

It鈥檚 totally worth the fear to see the views of Singapore

The helpful automated commentary is well done",,,
,,as good as anywhere in the world,4,,As good as anywhere in the world. great Views well worth a visit to see surroundings. gives you a good idea of direction around the city. Good value for money.,,,
,,Must Do at least once,5,,Last year we went during the day time the kids had a ball this year we decided to go in the evening so we could get a different view of the city at night. We got on around 8:00 pm the lights were on wow what a view of the city with the lights. Unfortunately on oneside the sea is almost dark but the city looks amazing even the gardens by the bay was lighted and looked unique. My kids loved watching the lights if your visiting Singapore this is a must do no matter what time you go you will enjoy the views.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,This is better than London eye and 360 view of the Singapore city is mind blowing. While they don't allow food or drinks inside the tube but 30 mins ride is Awsome and recommed to have in the night. It's good oversight over supertree abd marina sand nay night show between 8.45 - 9.15 pm is you happens to be during that in singapore flyer ride. Enjoy,,,
,,Eyes for Singapore,5,,I always visit there while I鈥檓 in Singapore. If I were there alone and there was not so crowded. Staff manage to get me ride alone! I love that privacy. Thanks to them.,,,
,,Better than expected,5,,Did not expect ride to be as fun as it was. Go at night for best visuals...after 7. They dont overstuff pods which was nice. 30min to get around is perfect Lights of city and Marina Bay.,,,
,,Awesome Night Views,5,,"I booked a night walking tour from the airport when doing a stop over in Singapore from Brisbane Australia and on my way back to Accra Ghana. The walking tour culminated with the Singapore flyer views.There were no queues and the service was super. People had wine on board whilst families took pictures. Fun to be, similar to the London eye.",,,
,,Spacious cabins; amazing views!,5,,"Came here during the day on a weekday, and there was no crowd, and no queue! We were quite surprised to have a whole cabin on our own, and thoroughly enjoyed the ride. The commentary is informative, to the point and unobtrusive, the cabins are very spacious and designed well to have the best views not obstructed by their own structure, and overall the whole experience was smooth and relaxing.",,,
,,Nice location and view!,3,,"Nice location and view. Especially as you enter the city. But nothing that you'd amiss, considering all other places in the city that you could visit and spend time.",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,4,,"Very similar to its London cousin, the Singapore flyer offers great views of the city. We visited on a Sunday morning and queues were short. The pods are air conditioned and although it鈥檚 not cheap, it鈥檚 clean and efficient. Well worth the ride.",,,
,,Views to die for,4,,Did a mid morning trip before all the tour busses arrived. The views are as good as you can get in Singapore. The rotation takes around 30 minutes which is more than enough time to see everything.,,,
,,It鈥檚 beautiful,5,,I love Singapore 馃嚫馃嚞 and come here many time and still love it !! Good place to hang out and the view so amazing 馃槈,,,
,,Great views of the city,5,,The Singapore flyer offers amazing views of the city. We went at 8pm and there was no line to wait it.,,,
,,Great views,4,,"Large air conditioned pods, giving a good unobstructed view. Screen in the pod displays information on height etc. Seats in the centre of the pod. Trip lasts about 20 minutes.",,,
,,Asia's tallest flyer and truly engineering marvel,5,,By far the best Flyer experience i've had in my life and singapore flyer is a must visit for anyone visiting singapore and experience is spellbounding,,,
,,Great experience,5,,"Is a must do experience the view was fantastic, the ride is air conditioned and we only had 6 people in it so was comfortable. Very informative about the things you can see while you are up there and the view from the start to the finish was wonderful.

Reasonably priced you cant go to Singapore and not experience this",,,
,,Birds eye view,5,,An experience worth undertaking. You can see the city in a unique and exciting way. Even those with a fear of heights will feel safe. The is no obvious movement of the carriages.,,,
,,One of a kind experience!,5,,"Hello! I enjoyed the flight in Singapore Flyer in May 19. It was a wonderful experience. The ticket costs S$ 33 for adult.

The Flyer has air conditioned capsules that can accommodate 28 people. But we were only 8 people inside. So enjoyed every moment in the Flyer. It takes you 165 meters high to have some breathtaking views of Singapore. In my opinion it鈥檚 a must do place in Singapore!",,,
,,Well worth a ride at night.,5,,"We enjoyed our ride on the Flyer at night, reasonably priced and simply stunning views at night, so many pics to be taken. A must do in Singapore.",,,
,,Great views,5,,A must to do when in Singapore. The views are exceptional. Go at night when everything is lit up. The skyline is something else!,,,
,,View of Singapore,5,,Well worth the trip . The cabs give a view of the city I would recommend visiting on a clear day so the view would be wonderful.,,,
,,A wonderful experience,5,,"My daughter and I really enjoyed the Singapore Flyer and were lucky to only have a young couple with a little boy in our capsule so had plenty of room to walk around, take in the amazing views and of course plenty of photos. It is one of the many wonderful things to see and do in Singapore and would certainly recommend it.",,,
,,A Different view of the Marina area,5,,"Same concept as the London Eye, the capsules in this Giant Wheel are air conditioned and move very slowly to provide ample time to get in and out.

The capsule can fit in about 12 people and depending on the peak/non peak times, you can get the capsule all by yourselves. We went in the morning (around 11am) and there were a lot of tourist buses, so our capsule was full with 12 people. However, that does not make any difference as the inside is spacious and you can view the surroundings from different corners of the capsule.

The total ride takes around 30 minutes which give ample time to see the panorama and take photos. On one side, you can see the Marina area with MBS, Gardens and the Singapore river while on the other, you can see the city skyline. Great views and slightly different from those on top of the observatory in MBS

We were not sure if we would want to go for both Observatory and Flyer. After doing both, I would say it is worth if you go for both on different days (also, make sure you visit one of the attractions after dark as the city lights is something worth seeing)

After finishing the ride, dont miss the small garden below and especially the Koi pond in which you can feed the fishes for $1",,,
,,Top view @ 165 meters.,5,,Class view of Singapore from such an hight of 165 meters. They do offer lunch with paid Services and enjoy the Romance of the life at hight of 165 metres.,,,
,,Sightseeing,4,,We came here for sigjtseeing. Since 1 person cost around 33sing dollars we just opted to visit the place. Go at the back have your picture taken overlooking garden by the bay and hotel marina bay plus you can see the F1 race track. A mist go place.,,,
,,A Nice Visit,4,,"The Singapore Flyer was a lovely excursion. It's definitely not a ""must do"" but it was very comfortable, the staff were great, and we enjoyed the view immensely. Our toddlers enjoyed walking around the large ""cabins"" and seeing things out the windowed walls.",,,
,,Scenic views,5,,Brought an overseas Friend there. Was a good trip and the duration in the cabin was about half hour. It was nice to be able to view the Singapore skyline and the surrounding areas including Batam. Was there in the evening at dusk and the view of the city against the setting sun was really good. Am sure a visit when the sky gets dark would show us a very different sight but that will be for another day!,,,
,,One of the most fun places in Singapore,5,,We were a group of 9 and we got an entire air conditioned capsule for us. We had one of the most memorable half an hour here. Enjoying the views and taking so many pics. This flyer is taller than the London eye and it takes 37mins to complete 1 round. You won't realize how quickly these minutes will pass. I would highly recommend this to be added in your itinerary.,,,
,,spacious cart with nice view,5,,the cart is spacious and air conditioned. we were at non peak hours so the cart only has our family and one other passenger. Our toddler got to run around the cart and have fun. the view is quite nice but not as high as ands skypark. the whole trip is quite relaxing. we recommend it. it's a bit difficult to find and quite some walk from the nearest train station,,,
,,A nice way to spend 40 minutes,4,,We enjoyed the Singapore Flyer although at 33 Singapore dollars ( about 拢19 each for adults) found it rather expensive. We had some good views although equally good views can be obtained in other areas of Singapore such as Marina Bay Sands Observation Deck. It might be fun to dine on board the Singapore flyer for a special occasion as we saw one compartment beautifully decked out for dining on board the flyer.,,,
,,Wow,4,,"It is giant Ferris wheel in Singapore gives one of the best city view. Cost about SGD30+per person ,a must visit attraction",,,
,,Nice way to see the amazing Singapore,5,,"The complete circuit takes 30 minutes, and the views from a top are amazing. The Singapore flyer is a giant observation wheel situated on the Marina Bay. It is the largest in Asia and second largest in the world.",,,
,,Cool views,4,,"Do it on your first day, so you have a good idea how the city looks like. Try to go on a quiet moment, so there are not to many people in the capsule.",,,
,,Masterfull,4,,"Amazing views of Singapore. We went at night and it was breath taking to see the whole city alight. It was crowded and the organization was not the best, but the overall experience was nice",,,
,,Fantastic view,4,,Very cool view from up there. Can recommend going up there around 7:10 pm in order to see the skyline at day at nighttime.,,,
,,Must Do,5,,"The Singapore flyer is a giant observation wheel situated on the Marina Bay. It is the largest in Asia and second largest in the world. The flyer has 28 fully air conditioned capsules which go 165 metres above the ground. One rotation takes about30 minutes. The ride is very smooth and the pace is also slow and steady. The view is absolutely breathtaking. One can see the singapore river, the garden by the bay, the Singapore skyline, the merlion park, Marina Bay sands hotel and raffles place etc. We went in the evening around 7.30 .The ocean was filled with many ships . It was a good decision as we could see the gardens by the bay lighting up for the light and sound show at 7.45 pm. Certainly worth a visit.
.",,,
,,Loved the Flyer,5,,Great views of Singapore from the flyer and was reasonably priced. We went early morning g and managed to avoid the crowds which was great.,,,
,,If you have to tick the box,3,,"It's something my travelling companion wanted to do so we went up and we came down. I noticed as we were entering the attraction, there was a flight simulator at a reasonable rate but couldn't find on the way out. Anyway, Singapore Flyer:Done.",,,
,,great view,5,,Nice air conditioned comfort to take in the views of Singapore. Very informative commentary doesn't take forever but allows enough time to take in the scenery,,,
,,Meal on the flyer.,5,,"We splurged and had a meal as we went on the Singapore flyer at dusk. What an experience, seeing the sunset and the whole of Singapore light up. The meals were good but could have been warmer. The staff were excellent.",,,
,,"Another Icon, Another Must Do!",4,,"I鈥檝e been on this twice now, first time at night, which was really pretty with all the city lights, and this time during the day, which gives you a much better view obviously. Day or night, I think it鈥檚 a must do in Singapore!
It鈥檚 a 鈥渟hare ride鈥?so unless you鈥檙e in a group of 8 you鈥檒l be sharing your capsule with others who may not respect your personal space, so bear that in mind. But it鈥檚 a glass enclosure so there鈥檚 plenty of room for everyone to get photos (although some people feel their need for a photo shoot over rules your needs, but that鈥檚 people huh!)
It鈥檚 a great view over the Marina and surrounding areas with running commentary the whole way. Takes about 30 minutes all up, is air conditioned and has a bench seat, along with a touch screen information point.
It鈥檚 an enjoyable experience!",,,
,,Nice view,5,,Its the one of the highest girandole in the world. Its near singapour sightsee and marinabay hotel and garden. When girandole goes up you have amazing picturesq view. I love it and hope to be there someday again,,,
,,Great view,5,,"Well this was my second ferris wheel ride after London eye. Both of them have a separate view which can't be compared. The Singapore flyer provides a great view of the Singapore cityscape, Marina Bay area along with the garden by the bay. Do take this ride, its worth it",,,
,,Great views of the coty,5,,"Purchased a combined deal from Suntec City as they don鈥檛 do them here, be sure to convert your card to a ticket (office next door to the ticket booth) before joining the queue to enter the flyer otherwise you鈥檒l have a lengthy wait for nothing! The staff in the ticket booth can be a bit surly & unhelpful which is a complete contrast to those supporting you into & out of capsules which is well organised, please keep hold of children when exiting as there is a gap between the edge & the safety barrier.

It is very slow moving & the momentum is lost a little as you go over the top, if you just want fantastic views maybe Marina Sands Hotel Skydeck is more for you as it鈥檚 higher at 250M as opposed to 161M on here. The price for the flyer is $33 per adult, but cheaper with a combined deal. Not normally one for these type of rides but pleased we did it.",,,
,,spectacular views,5,,"spectacular views, very informative with interactive screens, we went twice, day time and evening so we could see all the lights and the light show at the gardens, well worh it",,,
,,A great view of Singapore,4,,Not to much of a queue and a nice ride with stunning views. Not quite enough seating for the amount of people and aircon not that great either. Loved the koi pond but seeing a dead fish at he end spoiled it some what.,,,
,,Singapore Highlight,5,,"So lucky that we went there in a fine weather, the view is spectacular. Pay attention to the weather as there is always have a sudden thunder and the operation will temporally suspended during the day.",,,
,,Excellent view over the city,5,,"We went on an afternoon flight and fortunately had our own capsule. Having walked around the city on the previous two days it was interesting to have an ariel view of where we had been. Next time we are in Singapore we will do a night flight.
Go for it!",,,
,,Awesome ride,5,,We tuned this perfectly - lined up at 7 and we were on the flyer in time for the 7:45 gardens by the bay light show and then the :00 laser show from marina bay shoppes. Big queue but it moved fast!! Loved it,,,
,,"I don't see the big deal, but a good experience",4,,Was the first thing we did when we got to Singapore. It was a good experience to see the Singapore sky line and we managed to get on during the evening when the lights were just about to come on. But I don't think our 5 year old enjoyed it. She got bored half way.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,3,,"The Singapore Flyer is a very large ferris wheel, similar to the London Eye and the Orlando Eye in Florida. We went during the day and maybe it is more enjoyable at night. We felt it went far too slow and the price was high.",,,
,,Amazing views of the skyline,5,,Amazing views of the Singapore skyline and also a must visit ride in Singapore. The entire experience is perfect,,,
,,Day ride,5,,"Great place , no queues which was even nicer ,we were spoilt by having our very own bubble. Lovely views and plenty of time to take lots of pics . Tour guide supplied lots of info on the history of all Singapore .",,,
,,Definately worth a visit,4,,This is the way to see the whole of Singapore. The price is reasonable and the view is amazing. Better than a lot of similar attractions visited.,,,
,,Stunning views,5,,Our family really enjoyed the Singapore flyer. We booked tickets online but the queue was minimal anyway. We went just before sunset which gave us amazing views and photos. The small screens inside the pods allow you to learn about the various buildings etc that are visible from the Flyer. Well worth the effort (and money).,,,
,,Great,5,,"My husband and I were lucky to go at a quiet time and had a pod to ourselves which was great . We both really enjoyed it and seeing the fantastic views along with the commentary about the history and surrounding was wonderful, we would definitely recommend it.",,,
,,Worth visiting,5,,Come with elders and young kids. Both enjoyed a lot. The view is spectacular. Buy Singapore pass in advance and skip the queue.,,,
,,Good views for part of the ride; lousy drinks.,3,,"The Flyer has all the elements to make for a 5-rating review, but failed to deliver on two elements: (1) Our car was so cold that the windows covered with condensation on the outside half way through the trip so that we could no longer take photos of the city. (2) We purchased a premium entry package with a Singapore Sling, and it was absolutely awful. Just disgustingly sweet cherry juice with no detectable alcohol. You will do better just to get a regular ticket. At least then you can have a 4-rating experience because you won鈥檛 have to deduct for the drink.",,,
,,Must visit at nights,5,,"If you are fan of city's lights at night then this 33 SD trip will amuse you
A very good looking city special at night with a several positions to grab nice pictures so be ready with your camera through out the 30 min trip;
Check out my picture to get that point",,,
,,Good if you havent been before!,4,,Have done the London eye but my daughter hadnt so this was a experience for her. Pretty expensive for a slow half hour ride. There is better to spend your money on. Several locals advised us against wasting our money but I did it for my daughter. Would we go again? Definitely not. The plus is no queuing and you can sit or stand.,,,
,,Impressive Views,4,,Just like any ferris wheel or flyer it's all about the spectacular views. This one is nk different and offers wonderful views of Singapore. This was very busy when we went so had to share a cabin with others.,,,
,,It's walking distance from Merlion Park,4,,"The site of it can make you very happy. Singapore being a small country, most of the places can be explored without public transportation.

The ride is for 30 minutes and the view is spectacular. The staff is very soft spoken and kind. You will see a lot of smiling faces, can approach the staff around for any doubt or help.

The ticket price is worth the ride.",,,
,,Spectacular evening views of Marina Bay and Suntec areas of Singapore from the Flyer whilst having dinner,5,,I decided to book my partner and I a dinner package on the Singapore Flyer on the night of our arrival in Singapore. it was her first time in Singapore and I wanted her to get a spectacular view of that part of Singapore. it didn't disappoint. we also had a good Chinese dinner onboard. Service was great too.,,,
,,A must see site from Singapore,5,,"As the title describes, this is the most important site from the Singapore. It may apparently seem a costly affair (they charge SGD 33 for a half an hour ride), once you go inside and at the height, you won't regret the payment of fees. The views are awesome, the staff is co-operative...",,,
,,Photo opt,5,,"Great way to spend a half an hour with great views and photos! You can see the business district, parks, Indy car track, the huge port and ships waiting at sea and the architectural wonder The Marina Bay Sands Hotel complex!",,,
,,Room for improvement,3,,"I took a first-time visitor to the Singapore Flyer, confirming the actual experience of riding it is worthwhile. My experience of getting to the flyer, however, left me hot and annoyed and the disinterest of the young staff in my comments about the lack of signage didn't improve the situation. The website instructions say to travel to Promenade Station, take exit A and follow the blue signs for a 5 minute walk. I could not spot any signs and although the flyer is visible, a construction site blocks the view of which direction to access it from. On arrival we followed the sign to what we believed would be the ticket booth and entrance, only to find that the ticket booth was the floor below and the other side of the building to the flyer entrance. There seemed to be no logic in this location as it was neither near the carpark or foot traffic. If the flyer site hadn't been so isolated from other attractions I would happily have walked away at that point.",,,
,,Best view in the round,4,,Well worth a visit. Air conditioning in gondolas makes the 45 min trip very enjoyable. Terrific views and staff do not cram people in like in London. Only. drawback is the price which with the weak pound exchange rate made it expensive for two people.,,,
,,Wonderful views,5,,"We have done in the day, at night and one on the transition. Loved each one for different reasons. The views are amazing and it is well worth a visit.",,,
,,Great flyer,5,,Well worth the look. We visited this with our kids and we all loved it. Great views of Singapore and gardens by the bay.,,,
,,Fantastic views of Singapore,5,,Awesome to get a feel of how big Singapore is. Takes about 20 minutes and is well worth the cost. Air conditioned.,,,
,,Absolutely amazing view.,5,,"Good way to get a 360 degree view of the city, for the price its not too bad for 20 minutes of great photo opportunities. Carriages re air conditioned as well making it even more comfortable.",,,
,,Nice,3,,"Not bad, avoid on a rainy day as you cant see anything on the outside from inside.Even after the rain has stopped. Avoid the Flyer at night , not worth it.",,,
,,Up up and away...,5,,"If your time in Simngapore is limited, this is a great way to gain an overview of this vibrant city and surrounding environs.
Our capsule was spacious and comfortable, there was more than enough space for my wife and myself and a young couple with a small boy to walk around and take in the ever changing view.
We used the Hop on Hop off service to get to the Flyer, and the queue when we visited (a recent Sunday late morning) was minimal.
Staff were friendly and helpful, and there's the usual souvenir shop after your journey.
Thoroughly recommended.",,,
,,Great attraction!,5,,"Amazing views, easy access and could not fault this. We did this on our first morning to give us a view of the layout of the city and it did not disappoint. Highly recommended.",,,
,,"Worth the effort, great views",5,,"I am a fan of a good Ferris wheel so I鈥檓 a little bias here, but I would say, make the effort for the Singapore fly. It鈥檚 not easily accessible by public transport, so you might need to walk there using the easily accessible walking areas and even tho it鈥檚 hot, it鈥檚 worth the walk and cool in the pod",,,
,,Beautiful at night,5,,Loved the experience. Night ride is the best time when the whole marina is full of colour! It takes 30 minutes and you can stand or sit inside the capsule with about 10 other people.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer experience,5,,"Put this on your list of things to do while visiting Singapore. Looks like a large bike wheel. It takes about 30 minutes to do a revolution. Some cars are set up for dining. There are views of Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia are all on offer. Also good views of the Harbour and all the ships waiting their turn to get into port.",,,
,,Fyler is superb,5,,I have the fobia of heights but i have overcome that and took the ride of flyer and enjoyed the complete view of singapore...,,,
,,Incredible views and no queues!,5,,"We hopped off our sightseeing tour and hopped straight on the flyer. If you鈥檝e flown with Singapore airlines do tell the ticket office as you鈥檒l get a discount, we were lucky that they asked us. The view is breathtaking and it鈥檚 a great we to orient yourself to what the city has to offer. It certainly made us want to visit the Gardens by the Bay and to go up Marina Sands and walk over the DNA bridge rather than wait for our bus. No waiting in line and the pods weren鈥檛 crowded. Thoroughly recommended. Go early in the day as when we went, every day clouded over in the afternoon and pelted down with rain.",,,
,,Good,5,,The experience was really nice. I enjoyed a lot. it is worth the money. you get a nice view of singapore,,,
,,Fabulous views,5,,"We booked this trip in conjunction with the gardens by the bay - no need! Absolute loved the flyer but everything can be done yourself. The flyer isn鈥檛 too far away from the marina bay sands hotel and likewise the gardens - all walking distance from each other. The flyer itself is a very roomy sealed carriage moving very slowly. My husband doesn鈥檛 like heights but was fine with this. There was 4 in our pod and I feel that is enough to give you chance to move around. Great views of Singapore including the Grand Prix track, gardens and marina bay sands hotel plus other things. I would definitely recommend a trip on the flyer to get air views of Singapore, fabulous!",,,
,,Great use of 30 minutes to see Singapore from the sky!,4,,Great spot and if you want to see the city by night aim to be boarding at about 7.40 or 8.40 to catch the gardens by the bay light show and the Marina Bay Sands light show,,,
,,Romantic place for date,5,,I booked the champagne package for two with my Girlfriend. We waited at a lounge with comfortable sofa until they confirmed our reservation and made preparation. Went there during the sunset and got a nice view of the city transitioning from day to night when the buildings start to light up. We had the whole cabin to ourselves which gives us enough privacy and time alone. It was all perfect. Will definitely try their dinning experience in the future.,,,
,,Great Views,5,,It was an overcast and rainy day but the views are still amazing. It takes just over half an hour to complete a revolution. Well worth the ticket price if $33 for adults.,,,
,,Another must do with great views,5,,We do the Singapore flyer every couple of years...it is worth it as one can see how the town is changing. Usually in the morning there are not too many tourists and it is just a lovely way to see the town from above,,,
,,Great skyline views....and beyond,5,,"This is a must when in Singapore - it鈥檚 $33 but definitely worth it. On a good day you can see as far as the airport! Takes 30 mins once in the capsule. If you鈥檙e not good with heights you probably won鈥檛 like it, but at no time did it feel unsafe. It gives you a great indication of how much the city is growing and changing.",,,
,,Amazing night views.,5,,Definitely worth a ride. The views are amazing. We went at night and it was totally worth it. Not suitable for those who have height issues.,,,
,,Excellent Experience,5,,"You can have a great view throughout surrounding areas. View is excellent & you can take lots of pictures too. Ticket price is at kinda expensive site, but it's normal comparing with Singapore standards.",,,
,,get your cameras ready !,5,,"once the capsule is at the peak, be prepared to take some pictures because the view is excellent. worth trying at least once if u are in sg",,,
,,Un describable - beautiful,5,,You have to go - Its like living a dream _ You should also go the zoo - we spent the day there and then went back in the evening....You have to go there.,,,
,,Exactly as it should be.,5,,"Great views, clean pod which wasn鈥檛 busy and short wait times. This is exactly as it should be and puts the likes of the London Eye to shame.",,,
,,Nice view of Singapore!,4,,"Can take alot nice photos, alot nice buildings and see the skyscrapers all look so nice especially at night. Just see see only but nothing much can do lol.",,,
,,Singapore from the rooftop,5,,"Not one of the budget friendly attraction but experiencing nice view of Singapore from height seeing whole city downtown. Glass capsule going slowly up and down and not for people scared from height. Waiting time depends on tourist peak time, many fast food or restaurants nearby by.",,,
,,Great view,4,,Definitely a must do item while in Singapore we loved the view from up here and not that expensive unlike the London eye,,,
,,Worth a visit,5,,"Similar to london eye, highest point 165 m. Not as high as MBS. Good view of popular hangouts of Singapore. One round only for 25 min. So may be going up the MBS on sky deck would be better as there you can stay longer.",,,
,,Good substitute for London Eye,4,,30-45 minutes ride on the flyer definitely a eye popper for a photographer. Have plenty of time to capture the scenic views from Indonesian islands to all corners of Singapore from bird鈥檚 eye view. I do not recommend to buy the pictures of stalk as it鈥檚 not fairly priced and is a standard picture with your portrait in it.,,,
,,Fly on the flyer,5,,While in Singapore do not miss the flyer or gardens by the bay. Amazing architecture and beautiful gardens to walk through. You can easily spend the whole day walking around this one of a kind tourist attraction.,,,
,,Great view,4,,"Singapore Flyer is a 165 metres tall observation Ferris Wheel, that showcases the Singapore landscape well with a beautiful view of the sea and the Gardens by the bay.
Buy tickets online to skip the que.
Waiting time is about 15-30 mins.
Ride is about 35-45 minutes.
The ride is slow and people with fear of heights needn't be worried.
If uve been on the London Eye or similar Ferris Wheel, you won't be too impressed. 4/5. But for a first time goer its a 5/5.

Combine a vist to the Singapore Flyer along with the Gardens by the bay as both are just a 10-15 min walk away.",,,
,,Awesome,4,,"At SD 33 you can get a panoramic view of the entire city. If you go in morning or afternoon there is no waiting time, in the evening...yes. The entire round takes 30 min. iPads inside the cubicle will guide you with city information in different directions. We were two friends in the whole cubicle. However, the number of people in each cubicle will depend on the rush. Can be up to 20 or more, if I remember correctly. The whole ride is conducted very safely. Staff is friendly and always ready to show the way. They do shut it down during bad weather so you need to be lucky with with weather Gods during your visit. I found SD 33 too expensive for a 30 min experience. If they bring the price down I am sure they will get more visitors which will be more profitable to them. Even if you give it a miss you will not loose anything. Enjoy.",,,
,,Superb View,5,,A must do in Singapore with an experience of a lifetime with outstanding view of Singapore from the top,,,
,,Very impressive tour,5,,We entered the flyer and were immediately lifted high over the city. The view is excellent and gives a very good impression over the entire city. Visit again.,,,
,,Just WOW,5,,best ride ever! Got good view and all.. never even felt that it's moving.. its just so wow.. its a 40min ride i guess. Its so worth the ride and cost 馃憤馃憤馃憤,,,
,,"Amazing Experience, not to be missed.",5,,"I shared this experience recently with my husband and our friends who we were holidaying with. We spent 3 days in Singapore and this was one of our highlights of the holiday. We went in the evening so that we could experience the light shows over the bay and also see Gardens by the Bay lit up in its glory. We were not disappointed, the views were spectacular, especially when we reached the very top of the Singapore Flyer. The queues were reasonable, only had to wait about 20 minutes before boarding the cabin and the whole trip took about 40 minutes. We have some stunning photos of our experience to keep for future memories, definitely worth doing.",,,
,,Nice,4,,"My expectation with Singapore flyer was way too high and that鈥檚 why maybe I was slightly disappointed.
While it does give some beautiful scenic views from a height of 135 mtrs above sea level, it kind of does not justify the cost associated.

Experience is wonderful but cost is high.",,,
,,Wow what a view,5,,We chose to experience the flyer at night and were not disappointed. The view of the city was just amazing. Add this to your Singapore experience and you will be very happy you did!,,,
,,Great experience!,4,,"A have-to-do when in Singapore, ride goes very slow and allows you to take decent photos from behind glass. Go in morning when not busy and wait time is not long, nice ice cream stand at base!",,,
,,Observation wheel experience,5,,One of the tallest Ferris wheel in the world. Flyer 28 air conditioner capsules provides lovely view .,,,
,,a definite HIGHlight..,4,,"A great look at the Singapore and surrounds and an insightful commentary of everything surrounding...not sure if it is better at night, but daytime gives loads of perspective of where things are at including parts of the F1 Grand Prix track..",,,
,,Not to be missed,5,,"I have a phobia for heights but found the flyer to be quite OK. It rotates very slowly and is very smooth which felt comforting. Glad I did the ride as the views were amazing. Another advantage is it is on a hop on hop off Big Bus stop.
Recommended for all ages.",,,
,,Good Ride,4,,The view up there was good but cannot be compared with that on top of Sands Marina. The capsule was larger than expected and offered good all round visibility. The built was very strong and firm and offered a very stable and comfortable ride.,,,
,,Great City Views!,5,,"The Flyer goes very slowly so you can really enjoy the 360 views from the capsule. If you can time it right, the ride is amazing at sunset!",,,
,,Recommend the V.I.P flyer package at night!,5,,"Booked the V.I.P visit online on the flyer and this allowed us to wait in the V.I.P lounge, skip the queue for entry on to the flyer and we were given a luxury pod with nibbles and a singapore sling cocktail.

The views of the city from the flyer were stunning! Its a must when visiting Singapore.",,,
,,Beware purchasing with Klook App,3,,"We purchased a package off the Klook app and unfortunately got ripped off. It was for the Singapore Flyer, the Domes at the Gardens by the Bay and the Skywalk at Gardens by the Bay.
We needed to collect the tickets from someone at the time we booked the flyer and he gave us an envelope containing the tickets for all of it. We checked all 3 were there then were ushered onto the flyer. When we went to redeem my ticket at the Skywalk it was a childs ticket (only typed on the back and doesn't stand out). I ended up not being allowed on the Skywalk and to date Klook have been difficult to deal with and haven't accepted my email with childs ticket photo (claiming they can't open it, when I emailed it to my other email addresses and have no problems). When we were at the Skywalk someone else had the exact same thing happen from Klook as well.

The Flyer was a nice slow ride and had great commentary about history and sights to look at. It was airconditioned and had seats in the middle you could sit on.

Great for nice photos of Marina Bay Sands, The Gardens by the Bay and the city.",,,
,,Barbie Special,5,,Came here on the Barbie special carriage and had the whole carriage to ourselves. We felt very well looked after and loved the whole experience. Fantastic views of the bay and would recommend to anyone. Look out for the special carriages as they're really worth the extra money in my opinion.,,,
,,Great for people who love heights,4,,It is a 30 mins ride and you will get a good view of Singapore. If you are already staying at a high rise hotel then you can choose to avoid the ride. Must try if you haven't ridden on any flyer before this.,,,
,,Great view,5,,This was my first time in the flyer and I enjoyed it. This is an activity which all of us enjoyed. we loved the view and my kids were clicking selfies during the ride.You won't feel the movement and you will enjoy the ride.,,,
,,nice view,5,,nice 360 view of singapore. half an hour a round. Better go to toilet before hoping on one of the capsules.,,,
,,excellent views of Singapore and once in a lifetime experience,5,,If you are going to Singapore a ride in Singapore Flyer is a must. It is once in a lifetime experience so that's why I took my family to ride in it. The capsules are very roomy. And there is AC inside. So no problem on a hot day.,,,
,,The Novelty Quickly Wears Off 馃帯馃帯馃帯,2,,It was initially exciting for the kids but they quickly got antsy. Luckily cabs are big and roomy... But really not worth spending 30 minutes on this if you have many other activities on the plate.,,,
,,"Everyone Has To Have A ""Wheel""",3,,"You cannot miss the view of the 'Flyer"" on your left as you near the city from the airport and it looks like most 'wheels' but probably a little bigger.It does provide good views over Marina Reservoir and the city skyline but so do many other points in Singapore.Of course it is lit up at night like they all are.Unless you like swinging through the air in a small capsule walk the streets and see tne history.",,,
,,beautiful on the night,5,,We just pass by. not really getting in there.. but we can say that it is beautiful on the nights as city lights always look beautiful.. it is super huge! would love to try in another chance,,,
,,A very nice ride,5,,Get here early as it can get busy real fast. The wife and I really enjoyed the views over Singapore. Each of the viewing boxes are quite spacious and the full ride is at least 30 minutes long. There is a lovely little garden and a pool full of colourful fish right beneath the Flyer.,,,
,,Very enjoyable,5,,"We visited this early on an evening just as it was getting dark, and what a great experience this was.",,,
,,Pretty views,4,,Just pretty views but you can see even better views of the city from other places. We didn鈥檛 try the dinner inside the flier... maybe a worth it experience?,,,
,,Nice way to see the city,3,,"This would probably have been a more amazing experience if i hadn't yet seen the views from marina bay sands. Definitely a good way to see the city from above, but doesn't really differenciate from the sights you see from the marina bay sands rooftop, so i'd choose between these two instead of doing them both. A nice ride can't deny that.",,,
,,A bit expensive,3,,"Been here many times , honest review is a bit feel boring when ur inside the capsule not worth it , which is expensive to get there",,,
,,Good one time visit,4,,If you're in Singapore and have some time to spare this is a good way to see the entire skyline. It's about a 45 minutes ride in a capsule that accomodates about 10 persons and has sitting capacity too.,,,
,,Worth doing,5,,"We was staying at Pan Pacific club room with harbour views so we was spoilt with a mind-blowing view. The wheel was good to experience although, I did not see much more than what I could see from my room. If you're in a near by hotel with awesome views I wouldn't bother unless it's just something to tick off your list (as it was for me). added photo from view from Pan Pacific hotel on Raffles",,,
,,Well worth a visit - especially at night!,5,,"The Flyer is currently the World's largest ""big ring"", and as expected the overall experience was excellent. Each complete circuit takes 30 minutes, and the views from atop are spectacular (as you might expect). Taking an evening ""trip"" is good too with wonderful views over the City, and over the Gardens by the Bay. Probably one of the better locations to get good video of the SuperTree evening light show!",,,
,,Another must do while in Singapore,5,,"One of the best Ferris wheels in the world, go at night and enjoy all the beautiful colors of Singapore in the evenings. The wheel is very clean and it's easy to take great pictures even through the glass enclosure.",,,
,,Superb views across the city.,5,,"Located on the riverside right next to the F1 pit lane and garages. We purchased our tickets on the day @ level 1 & then went up to level 2 to queue for the wheel. There was hardly any queue so it was only a matter of minutes before we got into the capsule. The capsules are air conditioned. You get to go round the wheel once which takes around 30 mins. As long as the weather is clear the views form the capsule are spectacular. You can see Gardens by the Bay, out across the bay to sea plus you can look back over the city.",,,
,,Breathtaking View,5,,View from the top of the flyer is really breathtaking. You can see the sea on the one side. The view on the other side is bit limited due to high rise buildings and Marina Bay Sands hotel. But worth a visit.,,,
,,nice view,4,,I do enjoy it but it would be better if families can have privet capen and not share it with other family .,,,
,,A giant Ferris wheel,3,,"This is a giant Ferris wheel from where one can get some spectacular views of Singapore. Getting on these giant Ferris wheels like London flyer, and other such wheels in other countries is rather touristy and these tour operators trap you easily.
Unfortunately there are so many ways of getting spectacular views of Singapore that spending one hot hour in the queue and again spending one more hour on top is a bit boring.
Possibly having a ride at night to see the Singapore lights must be more attractive.",,,
,,Well worth a flight.,5,,"These vast Big Wheels are popping up everywhere now and this City is no exception. A flight in this very tall example gives great panoramic views of the majority of the city and allows you to reflect on how little an average tourist like myself actually covers on foot. The cars are very spacious and have a decent seating area in the middle for those who are tired or not great with heights. Commentary in my car was in both Mandarin and English.
Pleasant gardens have been created at its base . My adult ticket cost $33.00 but there are the usual group and family deals available.",,,
,,To slow.,3,,Not so impressed with the ride. Yes it is done well but boring after awhile. There are better ways to take in the magnificent views of Singapore. Do it once for sure.,,,
,,Round and Round,4,,"Unfortunately, we had a very looong ride because of one kid in our capsule that had a lot of fun and was shouting/crying incredibly loud. The windows were not as clean as expected. The ride was too pricy!",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"See many comments about long queues so guess we were lucky no queuing at all and really enjoyed the half hour ride. The wheel goes very slowly so plenty of time to take in all the views from 360 degrees and take lots of photos. Really enjoyed the ride and recommend it.
Only downside as they advertise senior rates but only applicable to Singapore citizens.",,,
,,worth the ride,4,,"Check it out at night if you want to see the night view of the city and visit during the day if you you want to see the entire singapore at a glance. Air conditioned and slow moving...best for all aged people.
My mom is afraid of heights but she enjoyed it a lot.",,,
,,See the whole country!,5,,"A great way to see the city state from a height. The capsules are well air conditioned and the views are amazing. A well organised venue, superbly run.",,,
,,28 mintes of wonder,5,,"It will take 28 minutes for one round. This will give you best view of Marina bay sands, Garden by the bay, Flower dome and river view of Singapore. There is facility for having dinner in flyer if you can afford. Once you finish flyer, near river you can also go for a river safari.",,,
,,Worth the ride!!,5,,"Fantastic views of Singapore from the flyer/ferris wheel Remember to claim your discount, if you flew Singapore Airlines.",,,
,,Awesome experience,5,,We didn鈥檛 manage this attraction on our last visit but am so glad that we did it this time. What a great trip with the family and what wonderful sights - definitely highly recommended,,,
,,One of its kind.,5,,"The flyer is so well organised. It feels amazing to be at that height yet not feel it. The views are amazing, you can see all attractions from the top. I would certainly recommend experiencing the flyer while in Singapore.",,,
,,The Singapore Flyer,5,,"The Flyer was one of the highlights of our recent visit to Singapore, since the views are superb, and I love to take photographs. Located in the Gardens By The Bay Area, the Flyer is easy to find and ride. It is very much like The London Eye. You simply buy your pass, then wait in line to ride. Each pod holds up to twenty people, so the line moves fast. The Flyer moves slowly, and is not scary at all. You will be able to walk around in the pod to take the beat photos, and you will be able to see the country, and out into the Marina Bay, where you will see all kinds of ships. It鈥檚 air-conditioned, and a nice break from the heat. The rid took about half an hour. Enjoy!",,,
,,The place u like to go to get the best view of Singapore,5,,"Its really nice and best its air conditional and its cooling, beautiful view and lots more.. what can I say... the only thing that its get really noisy if the cabin u stay with are talkative and loud since its a conceal area.
The food court was nice but expensive. love the traditional feel of it.
The historic explanation was great too before u get the ride... but I think its a little expensive",,,
,,Great View of the Whole Country,5,,"This is a must-see attraction in Singapore. The flyer is next to the F1 track area and the views are gorgeous. When you are at the top, it is nice to be able to look at the whole country and then also be able to look at Malaysia. Go at night to see the beautiful city. Also, the pods are not individual, they are oblong shaped. Unlike other ferris wheels, the capacity for people is large.",,,
,,"Singapore Sling Flight, nice!",5,,"When you book a Singapore Sling Flight, you wait in the Flyer Lounge until it's time for your flight. Skip the line all to the boarding. The flight is in a special cabin. Boarding is smooth, the cocktail handed to you when you're in the cabin. And off you go. We booked the last possible flight and were only joined by another couple. What luxury with only 4 persons aboard, sipping a very good Singapore Sling. The flight takes about half an hour, you can see the beautiful city of Singapore with all its lights.

,,Great views of the city,5,,Worth doing if you like viewing cities from above. The capsules are clean and modern and incredibly smooth. The whole ride takes about 30 mins and you get a really great view of Singapore. There are interactive screens in the capsules that are really handy for finding out more information about landmarks and buildings. Staff are very polite too.,,,
,,Memorable,5,,"The Singapore flyer was an amazing experience. Its got an amazing view of the city.
Try to combine Singapore flyer with Gardens by the Bay in the same visit .We started with the Singapore flyer in afternoon and followed it up with Gardens by the Bay.",,,
,,What a amazing view on top of the wheel.,5,,"Go there only wen there is good weather, so jou have a great view. Try to pick a time wen it's not busy, so jou have a gondola alone.",,,
,,Beautiful views,5,,"The views from the flyer are amazing! We had privately booked out a pod and had a dinner in here! This was very good! Dinner was served with excellent service and taste.

The flyer goes up
To 163 2 if I recall correctly and the views are magnificent. Highly recommended",,,
,,Awesome view of the city,5,,we went in the evening to watch both day and night view. The night view is amazing. The ride is very relaxing and not scary at all.,,,
,,Nice,4,,After having been to Singapore so many times this is the first time i did this and I think it was a lovely experience.The only thing the photo taking and asking you to buy it is not so nice but i guess they have to find revenue avenues and its not cheap 25SGD,,,
,,Wow this is huge with awesome views.,5,,"Went on this and couldn't believe how big it is. Was a very quiet afternoon so only my hubby and myself on it which was great. Was lovely with awesome views . I did get bored after a while as it took a while.
Great thing to do while in Singapore",,,
,,Fantastic view to get oversight of Singapore,4,,"The trip is high and view great . The wheel moves at incredibly low speed so not much of a ""ride"". The glass pods are not for those with vertigo",,,
,,Waste of time .,3,,"I didn鈥檛 like it personally . Wheel moves like a earth warm , it will give you 360 view though of singapore. No from my side .",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Is the world's largest Ferris wheel.
Marina Bay recommends adding more evenings in the afternoon, not hot, and watching the sunset or watching the light show.
If going up, you will see the entire city of Singapore.
Another place That is suitable for traveling Take a picture as a memorial Watch the view with a basket.
Singapore from above Must come at night to get a beautiful light atmosphere.",,,
,,Most favorite,5,,"Shouldn't be missed. The SG$33 is worth it! We took the ride around 15 minutes before sunset, and the view is a-amazing! Will not say no to riding it again.",,,
,,Looks amazing during night on photos,3,,Not sure how they manage but actually Flyer is much smaller than in pictures so we just looked from outside and did not try it as we had already full day with other activities. But I must admit that it looks very good during night time.,,,
,,Perfectview,5,,Wasn鈥檛 going to do this as thought it was just another 鈥榚ye鈥?but so glad we did. View is spectacular especially with marina bay sands almost touchable. Wasn鈥檛 crowded or queues when we went and had carriage to ourselves. Nice and air conditioned too. Nice cool way to spend half an hour.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,We enjoyed our Singapore Flyer experience. We purposely visited at night to view the light show from the Gardens by the Bay. So beautiful!,,,
,,Good scenary,5,,Ideal to take during evening. Cooling at night. Superb night view over the city fringe. Meals served if you ordered their package. You have to experience it.,,,
,,Amazing Overlooking Singapore,5,,"30 Mintues wonderful journey 360 degree overlooking Singapore, we did it on day light to better explore Singapore, you can also do it at night, it would fantastic.",,,
,,Fabulous views of the city,5,,"We didn鈥檛 book, we just turned up on spec, mid morning on a weekday. There were no queues at all, in fact we had a carriage to ourselves. Excellent way to view the city. It lasts about 40 mins and was less than 拢20 per adult.",,,
,,Ride in the sky,5,,"Great trip for taking photos, really lucky didn't have to book or queue and had the pod all to ourselves some amazing views",,,
,,OAP helped,5,,"We were greeted by a young man in the ticket Booth and he ask if we were OAP's as there was a concession for them, although I was not happy that I looked an OAP we did save some money. Well, worth the ride as the views were fantastic especially as we were right next to F1 Grand Prix Circuit.It was peaceful and slow so you can take photos as you go round. Definitely enjoyable we paid for the souvenir package of our photos and explanation of where everything was",,,
,,Fantastic Views of Singapore,5,,We visited early afternoon and there were no queues and just very few visitors. We wanted to see Singapore during the day and we would expect it would be spectacular to go in the evening as well to see the illuminated buildings. We enjoyed the views as we got to see the sprawl of Singapore clearly during the day. Spectacular views of Marina Bay Sands.,,,
,,Excellent,5,,Wonderful views of the whole of Singapore. I thought it was reasonably priced at $33 per person. We went late afternoon whilst the sun was starting to set and didn鈥檛 have any queues and a private pod!,,,
,,A must do attraction,5,,We went on the wheel at night for a sky high view of Singapore and wow was blown away the city skyline is just amazing the cabins are roomy and you can take heaps of photos...enjoy sit back and watch,,,
,,Great views,5,,The height of the wheel gives fantastic views la around Singapore and makes the London Eye look like a bicycle wheel. We went mid afternoon and there were no queues worth speaking of at all. Worth doing.,,,
,,Gentle visual treat,3,,"The flyer was immaculately clean, very quiet and provided beautiful views of Singapore. The staff were very helpful and friendly.. It was easy to get tickets, no difficulty in getting in & out. The hop on hop off buses drop you just outside.",,,
,,Boring...,5,,We felt it was a tad too slow and boring . It was like watching nails grow ... All this especially taking into account the cost and also the length of the queues to enter the pod.,,,
,,What a View,5,,With the possible exception of the Marina Bay Hotel the Flyer must offer one of the best possible views of downtown Singapore and the bay. We visited on a Monday lunchtime with no queues and a rapid entry to the wheel. The time to go around is about 30 minutes which is plenty to take in all the different angles and capture a few photographs. Each capsule is air conditioned with a central bench type seat with plenty of room to walk around id you want to. On quiet days staff will allocate a capsule per party so you may be lucky in getting one just to yourselves !,,,
,,"A must do for all visitors, great scenery",4,,"Should be on the 'must do' list of all visitors. Great views, a unique way to see the city and parts of the island. Precision processing as one would expect here. Expensive, but should be done.",,,
,,Iconic ride,4,,Very crowded group ride. Had about 45 minute wait. Better naked eye view than Insta opportunity. Worth doing.,,,
,,Exceeded my expectations,5,,"I took my lovely wife on a birthday flight with dinner and the lot. I had high expectations before we came but I said to my wife maybe the food is just average so make sure you enjoy the journey.
Actually the was great, our host Jeremy was top star and other guests in the cabin were friendly. So all in all a very positive experience and I nearly forgot the flight and views were amazing. Yes it was pricey but all worth it!",,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,"The Singapore Flyer, much like the London Eye offers fabulous views of the marina and city areas. In fact the whole of Singapore. The once round trip takes 40 minutes and the cost is S$33.00 per person. The views of the city were amazing. There is seating in the pods which hold about 25 people in each and sufficient area to walk around. There are screens which enable you to determine various land marks. The Flyer is also walking distance to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest both of which should be included in your trip. From there you can get a Shuttle for S$3 per person to the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The shuttle also has wheel chair ability. We would recommend the day should start with the Flyer, then the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome and finally lunch or drinks on the roof of the Marina Bay Sands. If your day includes all of the above and is to include lunch or drinks plan about 4 -5 hours",,,
,,Great views,5,,Excellent photo opportunity and a very enjoyable experience in what is at present the largest Wheel in the world,,,
,,Excellent Views,5,,It was not busy at all when we visited. We had a compartment to ourselves Prices compare to other similar wheels. It does provide an excellent overall view of the city.A good chance to get a perspective of how close everything is!,,,
,,Good View,5,,"Booked a Singapore sling package. No waiting line whisked away on a elevator to loading area. Given the drinks in the car. Very courtesy staff. Good view of 3 countries ,",,,
,,Very Amazing Experience,5,,"unforgettable moment when I can see the city light from above. I come here at 7 pm, all of staff very friendly and helpful.i promise that I want to comeback to enjoy amazing and beautiful view with my family",,,
,,Good time to chill,4,,"It is a great way to see Singapore from way up there. We went up at about 7 pm, just before sunset. This was intentionally timed. Seeing the the sunset colours was beautiful. By the time we reached the top, the sun had set and we could see the lights of the buildings across Singapore. What an amazing sight! The full circle takes about 45 minutes. Good time to chill.",,,
,,Great Way To See Singapore,5,,"The gondolas hold 28 people, we only had us. It鈥檚 a lazy way to see it all and get your bearing. The video presentation was full of content and packed with information, I actually wished I paid more attention, however I did get have the best fun you can have standing up running from side to side and back and forth to capture every conceivable picture. This is a must do attraction.",,,
,,Boring,2,,Get a view of the entire city. But gets boring after the first few minutes. There is nothing to do and you want the ride to end.,,,
,,Wonderful ride at sunset.,5,,Great view of Singapore at night. Best way ti see the city lights come on at night. Very relaxing ride.,,,
,,Worth checking out,4,,"Not a bad way to view the entire city if you're a tourist. If you fly SIA, you are eligible to receive discounts off the total amount. A bit slow at some points and depending on the cable car glass, you may not get very clear shots of the cityscape through the windows.",,,
,,A must,5,,Totally worth the time and money. Day time and night the views cannot be bet. Take your camera and totally enjoy,,,
,,Singapore Eye,5,,Great place for someone to get a entire city view and detailed information of areas and important places to visit in Singapore. Make sure you go for the last show as that time the entire city is lit up,,,
,,Worth a visit,4,,"A must if in Singapore. If you flew in Singapore airline you receive 10% off the bill. Fantastic views over the city and no queues whatsoever. Was closed when we went earlier as there was a little lightning. Can have tea or meals on this, look at website at different options. And seniors only get cheaper if they are Singapore citizens.",,,
,,"Second Best Viewing of Singapore, Day or Night!",5,,"Much like the London Eye, this Ferris wheel is huge. The ""cars"" are like large cylindrical clear tubes that provide amazing 360 degree views of the Marina Bay and the Singapore skyline. This is one of the MUST SEE things when visiting. The complete flyer rotation takes about 30 minutes so you have oodles of time to take tons of photos. During the weekdays it is easy to get a ticket to get on.

BOTTOM LINE: Great viewing of the city and Marina Sands Hotel and Singapore Skyline. The views are second only to the Marina Bay Sands roof top viewing area. MY RATING: 9/10",,,
,,Well worth the cost,4,,Had a few hours to kill before our flight so jumped in taxi and went out tot he wheel - so glad we did. Outstanding views of all of Singapore Harbour / City / Gardens and the Marina itself. The capsules are fully air con and large enough to carry 30 + persons but you mostly have them to yourself. A good option,,,
,,Best view ever,4,,"Well worth the money and you can really see the layout of the city, make sure its a clear day! If you travel singapore air you get discount just show your boarding pass",,,
,,Awesome views and a nice way to see Singapore,5,,"Had a nice walk around the Marina & with spare time, we decided to see the sights from the sky. We purchased our tickets anfpd walked up to the entry point which is bag searched thankfully. The flyer stands 165 m tall about 42 stories high and is 150 m in diameter and there are 28 capsules in total. The capsule is 4m x 7 m & holds about 28 people but we had 8 with us. The capsule takes around 30 mins to rotate once which is a speed of 14.4 m per minute. You can see up to 45 km on a nice clear day which was a very long way and our day was perfect. The Singapore F1 Grand Prix track goes under the flyer and you can get a good view when its on from the flyer. You can also see the sports & entertainment stadium built in 2014. All in all a lovely sightseeing adventure & I would highly recommend it.",,,
,,A Singapore must-do,5,,We took a group of six kids (aged 10 to 13) and two adults. No problems getting discounted tickets online. Arrived at 5:30 pm on a weekday and no queue at all - so a smooth entry. The capsules are large and nicely air conditioned; we had one to ourselves - such a treat for a top tourist attraction. One or two of the kids were a little scared of heights but the flyer moved slowly and everything felt super secure. We loved the stunning 360 degrees views - even on a cloudy day. Great experience and a nice gelato shop right outside.,,,
,,A must do.,5,,Everyone has heard of this Singapore Flyer. It is the tallest observation wheel in the Southern Hemisphere. The view is fantastic. A definite must do if visiting Singapore. Money well spent. The photos say it all.,,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,"Ticketing Counter Operating Hours: 8:00am 鈥?10:00pm
Flight Schedule: Daily flights: 8:30am 鈥?10:30pm
The first flight is at 8:30am and the last flight is at 10:15pm. The experience includes one rotation (30 minutes) on Singapore Flyer. Cost is $33. You can buy souvenirs from the gift shop. Nearby there is the Flyer Lounge where you can shop and dine. There is a beautiful Koi pond pop-jet fountain and ice cream shop nearby. Walk 2 min to get to Marina Promenade from the Singapore Flyer.",,,
,,Such an amazing view,5,,"At SGD33 each for an adult ticket I would say this is unmissable, on the wheel for roughly 30 minutes the view is exceptional. Tablet on board provides interesting facts about the wheel and surrounding area.",,,
,,A real high!,5,,"We got a great view as the flyer slowly turned. Could see most of the famous sites in the area: Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, Raffles Hotel,",,,
,,Riding high!,4,,"We rode the Singapore Flyer during our family holiday last year. Even though there were tour buses arriving all the time the queue to get on went quick. The view was magnificent and I'm sure would be even better at night. The kids enjoyed seeing from up high all the places they had already visited, and using the onboard screens.",,,
,,A Good Panorama of Singapore on a Clear Day,4,,"We starWe started our first sightseeing day of Singapore with a trip on the flyer. We arrived about 9:30am on Saturday morning and didn't have very much of a line. From the time we bought our ticket until we walked into on the the Flyer's pods, was less than 10 minutes. I hear that it can be very busy with long waits and crowded pods later in the day. There was only three other people in our pod while we made the single revolution of the wheel, which lasted around 30 minutes. It was great to be able to see the city laid before us, and I took many pictures of the places we would later visit during the day. You can stand up next to the window or sit down on the central benches in the pod. The views are stunning. The biggest downside is the cost for a ticket. And our experience would not have been so good if the pod was over crowded, since I walked around a bit to take pictures.ted our signtseeing day",,,
,,Great views,4,,"We went early (before 10) and were rewarded with a pod for 2! It may not be the highest building in Singapore, but it makes up for what you can see...including the start grid for the Singapore F1 night race (we walked along it after we got off the flyer). Ifnyou鈥檝e Been on the London Eye you can make out more landmarks as London has less skyscrapers, but the Singapore Flyer has a charm of its own",,,
,,Just Ok,3,,"The overall experience was just ok. Had much more expectation from the Flyer, but its just give you a city view same as Marina bay sands. Nothing new and I would choose Marina Bay sands any day for the city view considering the cost involved as well. You can give it a miss if you are going for a short stay and dont have time in hand.",,,
,,Highlight of Singapore,4,,Simply breathtaking views of Singapore. Spacious cabin. Well maintain and clean cabin. Always get your camera ready. Can have dinner also in the cabin. Simply wonderful.,,,
,,Interesting ride with awsom view of the city,5,,The ride is about 30 minutes long and very comfortable. The commentary during the ride was very helpful to identify different ares you see along.,,,
,,Nice views,4,,The ride on the Singapore flyer gives panorama views of the entire city skyline from a very different angle. One rode lasts about 45 minutes and gives enough time to enjoy the skyline.,,,
,,Must go!!!,5,,"I can see overall of Singapore building.. Good view to the sea...port, Marina Bay, esplanade, Indonesia boarder.... So many things you can see!!!",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,For a whole view you must visit the Singapore flyer. You can relax and enjoy the ride. Close to the Marina Bay.,,,
,,Must do activity in Singapore,5,,On a clear day this flyer offers the best view of rich maritime activity of singapore. You get a full view of the singapore straits and central business area and gold course. It moves at a slow speed so perfect for children and people who have a fear of heights and motion.,,,
,,What a view!!!,5,,"If i could go back today, i would! definitely a perfect view of singapore, On one side you can see gardens of the bay, another the marina bays. beautiful, romantic place! we fell in love with singapore.",,,
,,Great views over Singapore & surrounds,5,,"Fantastic experience, we were lucky to not have ques & only had 5 people in total in our capsule. Really good experience for those who have a height phobia. Amazing views in all directions when on the top but equally amazing views from all parts of the Flyer. We went mid afternoon on a lovely clear day. Has several information iPads to point out 鈥榩oints of interest鈥?as you go around. Great experience.",,,
,,Don't hesitate,5,,"Before our visit we were very clear that we are not doing flyer. We had passes for gardens by the bay and were to head for it,but my son(5years) was very cranky and not willing to walk ,insisting on going to Giant wheel (flyer ). We after asking an elderly couple, decided to take the adventurous flyer, which turned out to be relaxing extremely smooth and fantastic ride.
It was extremely beautiful and breathtaking night view.
Glad we did it.",,,
,,optional,3,,i am a stingy traveler. the ride i am sure is spectacular but there are other ways to see singapore vista. i advise you just take a selfie with this gigantic ferris wheel without riding it :),,,
,,The Best Way To See Singapore!,5,,"The views from the Flyer are fantastic all the way round the 30 minutes it takes to complete its turn. The weather when we did the attraction was clear and bright which meant we could see for miles across Singapore and the bay and it gave us a terrific sense of the uniqueness of the territory. If you're there for only a couple of days, like we were, you must do this ride before you do anything else in Singapore.",,,
,,See Singapore Layout,4,,"I recommend visiting this attraction on your first day inSingapore. You can see where all the important sites are located and save some walking time. Opens 0830, too bad Senior ticket discount only applies to Singapore residents",,,
,,Not as expected,4,,Nice to see Singapore from the sky but unfortunately you can't predict the weather. We had dinner inside. The quality of food was just ok ... everything very fast ... You also need to eat fast. Anyway we had a momorable day. We'll never forget our dinner over Singapore sky.,,,
,,A birds eye view.,4,,"Think London eye, but bigger. Allow a couple of hours for the trip and queuing. Spacious comfortable pods allow for an unparalleled view of the bay and city. However, this is not for someone who doesn鈥檛 like heights, once your on, your on!",,,
,,not bad,3,,"If you guys are a group, you might love it but I went alone was not interesting as it takes a long time the cues",,,
,,GREAT BY DAY BUT JUST SENSATIONAL AT NIGHT.,5,,"This attraction needs to be attended twice.
During the day you see all of the surrounding highlights BUT,
At night it is a totally different story. You get to see the light display at 8pm and all of the city lit up. The light show is great but the city light's are a must for photos.
Definatley bring you camera for this ride both day and night.
To me, like a lot of river attractions it is A MUST SEE DAY AND NIGHT.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",,,
,,Good but there are other options,3,,"We enjoyed the flyer - but there are lots of rival alternatives if you want a top down view of the city.

We went early morning, and there was no queue. There didn鈥檛 seem to be an MRT nearby, but we were able to get a bus direct there. Although it said the capsules hold 28 people, there were only around half a dozen in ours because it was a quiet time of day.

But here鈥檚 the issue. At $34 per adult, it鈥檚 comparable with other high rise views around the world. But there鈥檚 loads of competition. We preferred the One Altitude rooftop bar, for instance, which offered similar views - and at $35 came with two rounds of cocktails. Even the Marina Bay Sands Hotel bar is cheaper.

And although it鈥檚 a shorter building, the terrace on top of the Art Gallery also offers outstanding views.

So - although we enjoyed the Flyer - I think I鈥檇 actually recommend you give it a miss.",,,
,,One of the best moments of my life,5,,You have to visit the Flyer - it is really breathtaking. This is really an experience you鈥檒l keep for the rest of your life.,,,
,,Best way to see the city,5,,Try an evening trip. The views are incredible day or night. I had not realized that you could have a dinner experience. Looked great,,,
,,This is the way to 'see' Singapore,5,,"Sensibly priced, air conditioned way to see the City, with great views of the F1 track for the night race. You can imagine how the race would be. Good views if the harbour and City skyscrapers. if you are tight for time this is the way to see the City in comfort. Camera essential.",,,
,,Great Views,5,,Numbers of people limited in each pod which makes it easy to walk round to view sights and take photos. We came level with the top of the Marina Bay Hotel which was an amazing sight. Great way to get an overview of Singapore!,,,
,,The flyer is huge!,5,,"Each pod houses around 10 persons with seats in the middle for each one of them. But none of them remain seated considering the view that is available from the pod once it attains a certain height.
You can see almost the whole of Singapore and parts of neighbouring countries as well (Malaysia/Indonesia, I don't remember clearly). The most important landmarks such as Marina Bay Sands, Merlion Park, Gardens by the Bay etc. are all visible clearly.",,,
,,View of Singapore,4,,"It was raining on the day we were supposed to visit the flyer and the operations of the flyer are suspended during rain.Thankfully the rain stopped and after waiting for an our we were allowed to embark on the flyer. Well it was worth the wait, you can see the marina bay sands, gardens by the bay etc from the flyer. the view from the top is really nice. We skipped visiting marina bay sands since the view is more o less the same from there and the flyer.",,,
,,Reach for the sky.,5,,"I don't like heights, but the view is unbelievable. Virtually impossible to know you are moving. You can see just how every available space is utilised. Takes just over thirty minutes for the ride and is well worth the ticket price to see Singapore from this viewpoint. Sadly no reduction in ticket price for seniors who are non resident.",,,
,,Spectacular. Great views,5,,Great 360 degree views of Singapore city. Great opportunity for photo ops. All round views of the bay and the city. View at night is even more spectacular.,,,
,,The Purple City,4,,"This is a nice ride that takes maybe 20 minutes to complete the cycle. We went at night and the city seemed aglow with purple. It was beautiful. I was also told that on a clear day the daytime ride allows you so see some of the other islands in the area so it sounds like day or night you could enjoy it.

My recommendation would be when you get in the capsule, go to the right and then sit or stand facing to the right. It may initially feel like you are going backwards. As the car gets to the top and begins to go down, you will be well positioned to see the Garden by the Bay lit up as well as the Marina Bay Sands and the entire Bay. Many people walk around in there so if you are unable to get there in the beginning, work you way over there as you approach the top. :)",,,
,,Beautiful View,5,,It was a great experience for us to spend about 30 minutes on this Ferris wheel. You can see the beautiful view of Singapore from the above! Good place to spend with family.,,,
,,Awesome view,4,,A pretty cool experience with spacious capsule for a 360 degree view. A pleasantly slow ride that you will not miss all the views . Love it.,,,
,,Zusammenfassen mit meinem Aufenthalt,5,,"Great view, on the Singapore Flyer, you will get to see such city sights as the Singapore River, Raffles Place, Marina Bay, etc. The capsule is air-conditioned, can carry up to 28 passengers and a complete rotation of the wheel takes approximately 30 minutes. highly recommend",,,
,,30 minutes ride,4,,"It was a good experience for the family as we were able to spend 30 minutes of our time in this ferrys wheel. It moves very slow for you to see the wonderful city of Singapore. Though some may say that the ticket is expensive, it is a great way to see the city skyline as well as the parks in a high level. Added shops or activities needs to be done here as there is nothing much to do in this place than eat and ride the flyer.",,,
,,AMAZING,5,,We were a bit skeptical because of the height but it didn鈥檛 matter. The views were breathtaking and you couldn鈥檛 feell any movement.,,,
,,Great traveler activity!,5,,It was an excellent experience. We took it during the evening and the landscape over the whole city is amazing.,,,
,,A must See and Do!,5,,"This was fantastic. We went first thing when they opened. There were no lines and the view was most incredible. You could see the harbor, Marina Bay, and most all parts of the city. You could even see Sentosa. You will not want to miss this experience.",,,
,,What views - simply stunning!,4,,"Wow!

Spectacular views over Singapore from what was, at the time of it being built, the
tallest of such 鈥榳heels鈥?in the world.

The cabins are spacious and more importantly air conditioned 鈥?at the time we went there was just the two of us and another guy in ours.

It takes around 30 minutes to complete the trip, with stunning views of everything around 鈥?there are touch screens which show you the sights and provide further information. As we went 鈥榦ver the top鈥?we started to think of how the thing had been engineered and how it works!

It might seem expensive for thirty minutes but it was, in our opinion, well worth it, and our photos are stunning!",,,
,,Incredible view over the exceptional green environment 馃槑!,4,,If you don鈥檛 fear the height you can have an amazing view over the exceptional green surroundings! Singapore offers an unforgettable experience and this attraction is one of the must have done!,,,
,,Twilight time is best to visit,5,,This is a Giant wheel that will show you the whole Singapore when you are on top. Best time to visit is the Twilight as you can see the sunset and the whole Singapore in day light. I visited this wheel both the times (Day and Night) and sharing this feedback of my own experience. You will be amazed to see the big air conditioned capsules.,,,
,,loved this,5,,the views were amazing it was quiet when we visited so no queues it was next to the formula 1 night race circuit and so great views from above,,,
,,loved it,5,,"Went around lunch time and met with small crowds. We boarded the large pod and had it to ourselves, bonus.The views are gorgeous and it took around 30 minutes to rotate.
It is very tall and gave us great visibility from all angles.
I wanted a view of Singapore from a day and night perspective so did the Marina Bay Sands at night, a good combo.",,,
,,Excellent views,5,,"Deffo worth a visit for the view, takes about 30 mins to go round, plenty of food hawker stands downstairs for an inexpensive lunch",,,
,,Puts The London Eye to Shame!,5,,Absolutely beautiful views in a very specious cabins that are air conditioned. Great views of the city. Get there first thing in the morning and you will most likely get a cabin to yourself.,,,
,,Visited on 25 Jan 2019,4,,"Ticket is 33SGD if you show your singapore airlines boarding pass, they will give you 10% discount. there are some discount for senior , but only singapore people. trip was very good. one must visit this flyer",,,
,,Ok,3,,Like the London Eye but not as much to see. You do see the Grand Prix stands and hotels and the two rivers.,,,
,,Amazing view of Singapore thru this engineering marvel,5,,"Singapore Flyer offers spectacular view of Singapore through great heights. The whole experience of going slowly up in glass cabins & be able to see freely in all directions is simply unforgettable.

The location of the flyer at the marina bay is just perfect. On one side you can see the sea, beautiful gardens by the bay along with domes & 'the trees'. On the other side you can see tall skyline along with the famous 'skydeck' restaurant.

The cabins are ac & spacious (can easily accommodate 15-20 people). There is seating in the middle & the pace of the flyer is leisurely. Don't forget the flyer itself. Its an engineering marvel. There is a little garden with pond below the flyer. Good to get a few good snaps. The flyer round takes approx 30 mins. However keep at least 2 hrs to enjoy this place.

If possible, book the tickets in advance online rather than at the flyer or thru agent. You may save a few bucks.

The flyer is a 'must-visit' place for families, but it is a memorable experience for anyone. Enjoy it.",,,
,,Interesting but not really worth the price,4,,"The Flyer is huge & each pod is the size of a bus, The flyer is best seen at night when the bay & the buildings are lit up. Basically you can see the same thing if your hotel faces the bay & your room is high enough.",,,
,,Wonderful views of Singapore Old and New,5,,A hassle free journey lasting 30 minutes offering amazing views of Old and New Singapore. The Flyer is significantly larger than the London Eye. It can get busy in afternoon and evenings but we went at 11am and we only waited for 15 minutes.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Very nice view from Singapore flyer and people visiting Singapore should must try this joy ride. You can see the whole Singapore from here.,,,
,,FIRST ACTIVITY IN SINAPORE TO HAVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE THINGS TO COME,4,,"A big round wheel that moves at slow speed with a number of cabins.
get ticket from the window and prooceed.
during this 1/2 hour round of the wheel you will have a distant view of Garden by the Bay, cruises in the warer below, Marian bay sands and other multistoried 5* hotels.
all around the compound is well maintained.
from here you can walk to , as we did, ArtScince Museum. but be beware it is 1 km walk.",,,
,,Super View Of Singapore,5,,We got VIP ticket and the rest was history in a good way. You can view the whole Singapore includly the famous Marina Bay Sands and Singapre F1 Street Circuit.,,,
,,View of Singapore,5,,All the major spots can be seen from this place. The speed is so slow that you cannot make from outside that iot is moving. It gives sufficient time to enjoy the views,,,
,,Great Views,5,,This is bigger than the London Eye. Excellent views of Singapore. You will take fantastic photos. Each cabins holds around 25 people. Highly recommend,,,
,,Overrated,3,,"A little spendy but comparable to others at $33/pp. No better view than what you get at MBS or another highrise rooftop. TIP: If staying at MBS, no need to do this. Their roof is better.",,,
,,Best visited in evenings,5,,It is a great Singapore attraction and a chance to view not only Singapore but other islands nearby. It takes more than an hour to cover and the whole journey of reaching and the complex could be another 1-2 hours. Need to plan accordingly. They give you photos on payment with the flyer at background in different choices.,,,
,,Great Experience,5,,"Singapore Flyer is 165 m high and it's a great experience to go on it.The flyer takes you in closed cabin meant for 28 persons,but we were only 7 at the time I was riding .it moves slowly giving ample time to take photos and enjoy the scenery.it is very safe and enjoyable ride.total ride takes about 30 to 40 minutes.there are arrangements for dining and drinks on the flyer by paying higher ticket.
Otherwise there are snacks and eatables available near the entrance.",,,
,,Go if you鈥檝e never been on a Ferris Wheel before,3,,"It鈥檚 an interesting concept to allow visitors to have a birds eye view of the city, similar to cities like London. Go if you鈥檙e in the vicinity after visiting Gardens by the Bay, or having watched a concert/musical at The Esplanade...and would like to cap the evening off with a view of the city.

Ideal if you have the whole capsule to yourselves (they do offer private dining in the capsule for you and your partner but that will set you back by at least S$1000....you make 2 revolutions for a 4 course dinner) but we weren鈥檛 so lucky in that we were in a capsule with a noisy tour group on both occasions we were at The Flyer

If you鈥檙e looking for a good view of the city, there are other locations to consider",,,
,,Awesome views,5,,Loved the views especially of the harbour and coastline.Took half an hour to do the full rotation and i enjoyed every second of it.,,,
,,The first thing to do when arriving in Singapore,5,,The big wheel slowly rotates and gives spectacular views of Singapore. The enclosed air conditioned cabin is very safe and comfortable for those who are concerned about this type of adventure. An absolute must.,,,
,,Most amazing sight with parents and being a parent,5,,"Full of selfies, and their provided assistant too for paid pics.
Amazing experience specially when it comes to view whole city being moving and the digital assistant for maps and location within was superb.
It was fun.
Recommended for first time goers
Clean
Ample of parking
Paid food is there but not allowed inside.",,,
,,a boring ride but with nice view,3,,"Singapore skyline is certainly wonderful, especially at the sunset. The ride is however so slow that can become boring. Having 20 people per capsule also ruin the atmosphere. Suggest to board around 6.45/7 to catch the best of day and night",,,
,,Amazing Views,4,,"Really enjoyed our ride on the Singapore Flyer ...
It wasn't very busy when we went on a weekday and luckily we didn't have to queue or share our pod with any other groups.

It's a slow air conditioned journey - great views and there are devices in the pods that tell you about the points of interest etc

There is a souvenir shop at the end that you have to walk through to exit - but it had a wide range of goods - with cheap to expensive items so something for everyone.

There are food options in the complex as well - so it's popular with the tour buses - we did encounter a few while we were there.

A good experience - recommended. Reminded us of the London Eye but just different country / scenery.",,,
,,Fantastic view,4,,The flyer allows you to see the whole of Singapore from a different perspective the ride takes approximately 30 minutes we went early evening allowing us to see the city come alive with its wonderful lighting,,,
,,Excellent views,5,,"A tad cheesy, but great views of the city island! Very comfortable compartments. Short video runs during the flight, giving wonderful perspective of the various neighborhoods. Would be equally fun at night to see all the lights of the city!",,,
,,Great views from Singapore Flyer,4,,Well worth the price if it鈥檚 a clear day. Better views than from Marina Bay Sands and there is a running video explaining what you are looking at.,,,
,,Singapore version of the London Eye,4,,This was a fun experience and a great way to get some breathtaking views over Singapore. I highly recommend doing the Champagne Experience which doesn't cost must more and provides a much more exclusive feel,,,
,,Enjoyed the ride,4,,A nice experience. Beautiful views of the Singapore city. Really magnificent. Worth visiting and not to be missed.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"We happened to go on Chinese New Year so the queues were minimal and instead of putting 28 people in a pod, they put 10 so it was spacious to walk around in there. I鈥檇 recommend going at an empty time. We went during the day so we could see very far and the views over Singapore were fantastic.",,,
,,Wonderful Day Experience,5,,Buy the tickets online to avoid long queue on ticket. I bought it on KLook app and it was hassle free! The view from the top was wonderful. And it sure was worth a visit!,,,
,,Great,5,,We have gone on this 3 Times. Once we did the Moet private style and it was great too. If you are looking for a great view this is it.,,,
,,Nice Experience,4,,"Had a new experience with nice views.

Be smart enough when standing in the lines to see if there's a group boarding or not.

You can sometimes during non-peak hours have the entire thing to yourself or with just 1/2 people.

It's a decent experience with the entire aerial view of Singapore attractions nearby.

If you want freebies or a gift bag, don't forget to fill out the review/experience form. There should be someone sitting during your exit route to the building, fill out the review papers and have your goodie bag.",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,We were extremely fortunate to have free access to the 'Flyer' during the F1 weekend. Great views of the Marine Bay track and wider Singapore. Not to be missed.,,,
,,Slowly we turn,5,,360 views if you aren't afraid of heights! You can also see into Indonesia and Malaysia. It's located in Marina Bay so you can check it out when you go to see the Cloud Forest and hotel.,,,
,,okay experience,3,,This is something like london eye. Not like must visit place in singapore but you can visit this place to have a birds eye view of singapore,,,
,,Not advised - Expenses and boring,2,,"You might have as good of a view in many other places in Singapore, and at least without beeing stuck for 45 minutes in a cabin where there is nothing much to do. I find it pricey for the ride, and you might even have to queue at the entrance for quite a long time.",,,
,,Amazing Wheel,5,,The Ferris wheel is so huge and so amazing. It gives you a spectacular view of the whole city of Singapore,,,
,,singapore holiday,5,,"The flyer takes 30 minutes to complete one rotation. The flyer provided good views of the marina and city skyline. Another option to see the skyline is to go to the top of marina bay sands on the 57 floor,We had the delicious Singapore sling. The marina bay is only a few minutes from the flyer",,,
,,"SIT BACK, RELAX AND ENJOY THE AMAZING VIEWS !",5,,"The Singapore Flyer offers spectacular, panoramic views in all directions and beautifully captures many aspects of Singaporean life and attractions. The Flyer has 28 spacious, air-conditioned capsules, takes approximately 35 minutes to revolve and is supported by a terminal building that contains all the facilities that visitors require. We purchased a travel package from a local tour operator involving train, river taxi, tour bus and the Flyer and it was excellent value. A ""must do"" for a first time visitor. Enjoy !",,,
,,"Superb experience, amazing sights of Singapore with 360 degree aerial view !!!",5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a giant Ferris wheel and one of the tallest in the world !!! It offers a superb experience and amazing sights of Singapore with 360 degree aerial view !!! The best time to be at the Flyer is the twilight zone when the skyline is still clearly visible in the fading natural light and then the lights come in to picture and the whole city looks stunningly pretty. We ensured that we reached early and got the tickets for the first slot at 7 pm so that we got the best view. The flyer is huge and moves at a very slow and nice pace. Each capsule is big and can accommodate about 8-10 people. The capsule is air conditioned a comfortable.

The only other similar experiences I have had is with the London Eye !!! Tickets are not very expensive and i would strongly urge every tourist to experience this place.",,,
,,Nothing Special,4,,Singapore flyer was nothing really special to us. We just decided to experience as much of Singapore as we could.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"A giant Ferris wheel in Singapore with 28 air-conditioned capsules. Also known as an observation wheel. One rotation approximately takes about 32 minutes.
Tickets can be purchased online in advance or can also be bought at location.
The Singapore Flyer attraction has a 3 story terminal building with Wheelchair ramps and lifts,public toilets, and a dedicated parking lot. At one point, was worlds tallest Ferris wheel.
The Flyer provides beautiful views of the city and bay areas in Singapore.",,,
,,Good views of marina and city,3,,The flyer takes 30 minutes to complete one rotation. The flyer provided good views of the marina and city skyline. Another option to see the skyline is to go to the top of marina bay sands on the 57 floor. The price of the elevator ride provides a credit $20 towards a bar drink. We had the delicious Singapore sling. The marina bay is only a few minutes from the flyer,,,
,,Great Views of Singapore,5,,The Singapore flyer offers great views of Singapore. At S$33 per adult it's not cheap but it's not overly expensive either. Certainly worthwhile for a first time visitor to Singapore.,,,
,,Review of singapore flyer,5,,"The experience of sky dining was amazing. The ambience was brilliant. But the food was just average. Looking at the cost of the entire thing, it really isn't worth it. The starters and desserts were good. The main course was just average. The service is very good. The staff know how to take care of you. The only down side is that there really isn't that much of a value for money.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer - wow what a view!,5,,"My family of four went on the Singapore Flyer in January 2019. Wow the views really are spectacular and it was a very quiet and almost motionless ride (it takes about 35 minutes to go completely around in one rotation). Only six people in our capsule, which was great as it allowed us to move around the capsule, taking lots of photos. A must see in Singapore.",,,
,,"A ""Unique View""...",5,,"From a distance, the SF resembles a ""Ferris Wheel""--- but it has air conditioned ""Gondolas"" (there are 28... and each can easily hold 28 people) to accommodate guests in comfort. After 2 1/2 years of construction it was opened to the public about 11 years ago. Its central location, on Marina bay, offers wonderful views/sights [from a maximum height of about 540 feet] of Singapore as well as several islands which are a part of Indonesia and the Malaysian mainland. The views are interesting both during the day as well as at night! It is a definite ""Must See"".

I hope that this Review has been helpful.",,,
,,Wow,4,,Loved the views... Better do it at night or at dusk for best views Slightly expensive.. and slow.. but older kids will enjoy the view,,,
,,Wonderful,5,,It was amazing visiting the place. Love to visit again. Can see whole city from the top. It was a great experience.,,,
,,Singapore Sling tour,5,,We booked the Singapore Sling tickets and were treated like VIP's. We were lucky enought to have the cable car to ourselves to enjoy the spectacular views. The singapore slings were comparable to those that we had tried at Raffles,,,
,,High!,4,,It's a very big wheel! Great views and considering you're on it for around half an hour not bad value especially early morning when it's nic eand quiet.,,,
,,Great panoramic views,5,,"Although we have visited Singapore a number of times this was our first trip on the Flyer
Well worth it for great views over Singapore and the harbour (so many large container ships!) I
If it鈥檚 your first visit this is a good way to see where everything is and the open top hop on hop off bus goes from here as well so great to be able to see as much as possible.
The small food court under the flyer is also very good They do a good Chines Rice and chicken curry noodles at one of the stalls which is very good value - much cheaper than the restaurant on the same level!",,,
,,Not Value for Money,3,,While on the Flyer it STOPPED really scary and had happened few times. Will think twice before buying ticket to FLYER,,,
,,Great for nervous people,4,,I have never been on the London Eye as I don鈥檛 like heights but decided to give this a go as it was recommended to me by a friend. Huge stable cabins and slow movement was very reassuring besides giving plenty of time for photos. On the day we went there were no queues mid morning and there were only a few other people in our cabin so plenty of room to sit and move around. Great views.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"We were there early and had a car to our selves, the views are great and it鈥檚 well worth the trip. We then jumped on the hop on hop off bus just outside.",,,
,,REALLY FUNNY OLD MAN,5,,"There was a comical old fella in the ENTERANCE. He really cracked me up. I felt like I was at a comic club. The rider itself is really fun, too.",,,
,,It was good fun. Glad we did it.,4,,"We did it in the later afternoon of a week day. It wasn鈥檛 busy, so we were fortunate to have an entire capsule to ourselves - it was like just booking a private capsule :)

The entire flight took about 30 min. It was good to take in the expansive 360-degree aerial view of Singapore - absolutely gorgeous!

A tip: don鈥檛 pay full price (adults at S$33 each). If you have flown with Singapore Airlines or SilkAir, your boarding pass entitles you to a 10% discount. Also, go to the Singapore Flyer website and click on 鈥淓vents & Promotions鈥? There are some good Chinese New Year discounts at the moment. Enter into an online draw with your name and email address to win one of the many prizes. It鈥檚 a sure win kind of thing. We got a 1-for1 Singapore Sling Flight voucher.

On our next visit to Singapore, we might to try the Sky Dining experience ...",,,
,,A great way to see the city,4,,"Brilliant views of the bay, city, Marina Bay Sands, Gardens By The Bay, etc. We opted to go at night to see the lights and it was well worth it.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,You can see everything from the top. Amazing creature. Moves slowly and no need to worry. Must go a ride.,,,
,,Top of Singapore,5,,Its a birds eye view of Singapore. Best time to visit is in the morning as there is hardly any rush. The commentary is not over bearing. The view awesome. Singapore skyline superb.,,,
,,View from above,5,,This is akin to the London Eye and it is well worth doing for the spectacular view it provides you of the city.,,,
,,Better options to Singapore Flyer,3,,"It鈥檚 an ok but not wow experience. A bit slow and takes around 40 minutes to finish the lap. Amazing view of city skyline and famous attractions, specially at night. Yet, the Skypark, I think that鈥檚 the name of the three towers connected by a roof top park and pool, for it provides the same view, in addition to you moving around several areas of the attraction, instead of staying trapped in the glass compartment of the Flyer.",,,
,,Nice view of city,4,,A nice view of city from the top. My advise is to go into day time.Because during night you will only the lights int he building and towers.,,,
,,Great Views,5,,"We went up the flyer just before sunset, so got the best of day and night pics. Great views over the city. Worth a visit",,,
,,Mesmerize yourself,5,,Get on-board this flyer and witness the beauty of Singapore. Tickets for the same are approx 33 SGD per person. Book it online in advance to get good discounts.,,,
,,Great Vistas,4,,"Not being a fan of heights, i was hesitant to go however, this is something that deserves a repeat visit! One is even able to have a meal served during the very slow rotation. We did the tour during the day but i am sure at night, it is perhaps even more impressive.",,,
,,Its quite pricey,3,,"Its quite pricey for a 30 mins ride. Although you can see Singapore skyline, it didnt gave me an awesome feeling. Quite a disappointment",,,
,,Fantastic sights,5,,Well organised venue with helpful staff. Only a short wait and opportunity for progressing with different levels etc without just standing in a queue. The sights were fantastic and it was a lovely peaceful time. A must see/do!,,,
,,End to our honeymoon,3,,"This was the final excursion on our 5 country honeymoon tour, really memorable evening. I remember seeing the F1 track from the flyer, must he amazing on race days. Can't remember what I paid but definately should be on your list of things to do in Singapore",,,
,,Second visit to the Singapore flyer ..this time at night,5,,"We chose to return to the Singapore Flyer. Last time views were during the day , this time, chose the evening. Great service , super views, take your camera..got some good shots",,,
,,top of the world,5,,Huge wheel takes you around and get a birds eye view of the city. Make sure you have enough times in your day since it takes an hour for the full circle.,,,
,,Decent,4,,"We hit at a busy time - when we were leaving there was no line.

This is a decent way to get a great view of the city and bay. It's cheaper than many of the wheels around the world.

There is a Disney - like line of people on the way to boarding so you don't really know how long the line is.

Worth the stop",,,
,,A calming experience,5,,"Warning : Does not operate in rain..... So plan accordingly and book tickets only for much better rates.

It's beautiful. During the morning , evening or at night, this flyer offers great view of the city skyline and much more.
There are option for dinners to enjoy a meal here too. It's more of an attraction then a ride cause it's very slow and a full round takes over 20 minutes. Every minute is well spent and what a place to grab some amazing pictures and selfies for your Facebook or Instagram account.
There are a few food options located at the bottom and a cool souvenirs shop at the exit. Some things you get only at this shop and not at any other market like China Town or little India so don't miss out on the collectibles if you happen to like any.
It's a part of Singapore trip that is a must see. Personally I enjoyed the view at night after having a very hectic side seeing day. Check out the pictures for a better idea of the view at night.",,,
,,Views?,4,,"Ok the view from the flyer is amazing, no doubt about that...... 45 minutes in a glass cylinder with 6 or 7 complete strangers is not.
This is an incredible thing to do and a high point (no pun intended) of my trip to Singapore, but here are a few reasons why my trip in the flyer was not 鈥減erfect鈥?
1) I鈥檓 frightened of heights, so I wanted to sit on the bench and watch the world go by, but I had to deal with people essentially running from one side to another to take photos.
2) the amount of selfying was ridiculous. I get it, you want people to know you did it...... so tell them, but don鈥檛 make the cockpit waggle when I鈥檓 stressing already, just so you can have the Marina Bay Sands over your shoulder.
3) whoever farted in there, I hate you.
4) even though I was freaking out the whole time, I think the ride needs to go on for a little bit longer....

Lovely views and a generally great experience, as usual, probably better without other people.",,,
,,Not London But still cool,4,,"After going on the London Eye and seeing all the different attractions this one seemed not as exciting. If you havnt done it before you have to give it a go, I really enjoyed it and recommend it.",,,
,,Great view,5,,"Was really pleased that we went up, lots of room in the cabins, and WoW the view was fantastic, best to go midweek, if you go at night try and go up about 7.30 , then you will see the light show from the gardens.",,,
,,Worth the visit,5,,Definitely worth to visit . It鈥檚 a bit expensive but what is not in Singapore . Prices is 33 for adults and 21 for kids,,,
,,"A nice view of the city, even better at night",4,,"In the past 20 years, more & more world class cities are adding these giant ""Ferris wheel"" to their cities Singapore's Flyer is similar to Hong Kong - located to capture the phenomenal colorful city lights and reflections on the water. While the scenery is enough to pleases most people, knowing what specific buildings or locations (from an earlier visit to those sites) makes it that much more enjoyable.",,,
,,Singapore sling flight,3,,"The actual ride itself was great, and the Singapore sling delicious. We had our own pod that was decked out with plush seating and nibbles. The reason I am deducting rating points is due to the lead up. It was difficult to find where to collect tickets, and we were told to come to Guest Services to wait for an escort to the ride at 1.45. Over thirty minutes later we were still waiting for the escort. With an impatient five year old this is just not acceptable. They should tell people to come to Guest Services at the correct pick up time. It was just not organized at all.",,,
,,Singapore Sites,5,,"Another must do if visiting Singapore, spectacular views of the skyline, the harbour and Marina Bay Sands Sky Park, very reasonable ticket price @ 拢38, it takes approximately 30 minutes per revolution, if you arrive early you can beat the queues!",,,
,,Amazing,5,,I had decided to go on the flyer after much deliberation. It is truly amazing and doing it at twilight time was wonderful. Be prepared with your camera and get glimpses of singapore. It is like a big giant wheel but no problems for the faint hearted. Don鈥檛 miss it,,,
,,good for once,5,,it is a very good ride. good for a one time experience. its appx 4 minutes ride. you dont feel it moving. the sights are great during the day and night. found it a bit pricey but then again all singapore attractions are. but they do makeup for it with the service and comfort.,,,
,,Must experience it Once,5,,"Its the 2nd highest Flyer in the World. At 165 Meters (the top most point), its 2 Meters shorter than Flyer in Las Vegas and 4 Meter taller than London Eye. Most people skip it because they find $ 33 Ticket quite steep. However considering the experience you get and view that you enjoy , the price is not high. Its worth experiencing at least once.",,,
,,Awesome experience,5,,Must do whenever travel to singapore. Iconic view of singapore city any one can enjoy from here. Better to go at late afternoon.,,,
,,Can be skipped when children are less than 5 or even 6 years.,3,,"We did the Singapore flyer with children all less than 6 and we realised that it could have be skipped .
They have huge lines (our wait was 45 mins ) and they don't allow you to give food to the kids while waiting . Maybe they don't want the mess .",,,
,,Spectacular view at night,5,,I suggest to have a trip when dark as the lighted Marina is spectacular to view from the flyer. The turn Takes 30 minutes.,,,
,,Wonderful experience,5,,We visited singapore in jan and chose to take a ride in the flyer. Its an exhilrating experience once you reach at the top of the flyer. A must go.,,,
,,A unique experience and awesome view,5,,"You have to be in it to see the beautiful view of the city and gardens. Very comfortable ride and the capsule spacious and environment controlled to have an unobstructed 360 view. Also, you can book the whole capsule to yourself, and there are different packages available that include food & drink etc",,,
,,Great views,4,,"If you have never been on a Ferris Wheel in a major city, do it. It is very informative about the history of Singapore and things to do in the city if you have no idea what you want to do on a short stopover.",,,
,,Super view of Singapore,4,,For a spectacular 360 view of Singapore this is a sure way.. We were fortunate there were no ques and we managed to get there easily although many of the tourist buses cover this stop on their itenary,,,
,,Good views of the island,5,,"One of the best of its kind. Stunning views of the city, large window, clean and stable. Very similar to the London Eye, but without the fog.",,,
,,Must do!,5,,It鈥檚 a must do when visiting beautiful Singapore. The lines weren鈥檛 too bad. Views are spectacular and you really can鈥檛 tell that your moving. It takes about a half hour to go up and back down.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer Better than Any Giant Wheel,5,,I visited Singapore & Malasia from travels go and really the best experience I got Because of there tour timings & just because of that I came to experience the awesome lightings of Singapore Flyer. Thanks Renu,,,
,,Not worth the price,3,,"We pay $33 for adults and $21 for kids. The ride last for almost 30minutes, quite a boring experience for the kids (and for adults frankly). We definitely enjoy the cable car more.",,,
,,Beautiful At Night,5,,"Singapore it鈥檚 self is breath taken. I visited the flyer at night and it basically shows you all of Singapore.
The way the building lit up the night was beautiful!
When done viewing the city, they have small souvenir shops in the same building that I went to and were reasonable with prices.
The museum and gardens by the bay were walking distance for us, especially since the weather was amazing!
For those who don鈥檛 like walking, there鈥檚 Uber in Singapore!",,,
,,Landmark of Singapore,4,,Singapore Flyers is the major landmark of Singapore. It is near Garden by the Bay and is one of major attraction for visitors. At night it became more beautiful.,,,
,,First class Experience,5,,Well worth doing to be able to see the fantastic views of the bay and to see the fantastic skyline of Singapore.,,,
,,Great views,4,,"Book before you go on line so you just go direct to the ride. It wasn鈥檛 busy the day we went it was set up for big queues so it must get busy. They take a photograph as you go in, it鈥檚 automatic and when we viewed it, poor quality, we looked like escapees from an asylum, they wanted 50 SD! The ride goes quickly because there is so much to see, it takes about 30 minutes seems like 5. Great photo opportunities, plus makes you realise how compact Singapore actually is.",,,
,,Good experience !!! but little expensive for 30 min ride,4,,"Pros :

1) You can have a great view of Singapore , (garden by bay ) , (marina bay sands ) etc

2) about 8 to 10 people per cabin ,

3) cool and calm place to enjoy 30 mins

Cons

1) a bit expensive , (was like 40 to 50 dollars)

2) they should add some western food restaurants also , which really disappoint me and my family",,,
,,It's okay,3,,"It's okay, not the most fantastic view of Singapore, and it takes awhile to get around maybe 30 minutes but at least you get your money's worth",,,
,,NEED MORE!,5,,"Next time I'll be taking the dining option. Views are spectacular, light shows look even better, staff super courteous and physically helpful. My only issue is that half hour isn't long enough.",,,
,,Perferct View of Singapore,5,,It is tallest flyer in Asia. It gives you great view of Singapore. You can get perfect views and also get to click nice pics.,,,
,,This attraction was good - but a bit expensive,4,,"The view was lovely from the top, but I had trouble getting past the expense for something that takes only 1/2 hour. In fact, I think we waited longer in line to get on it than we actually rode on it. Its very well maintained and modern and the kids absolutely loved it!",,,
,,Brilliant!,5,,"This wheel is even bigger than the London Eye, and takes about half an hour to complete its turn. As expected, the view from the pods is amazing. Well worth a visit.",,,
,,What a nice ride,5,,"A must if you enjoy heights...and even if you don鈥檛, this is a wonderful way to get a birds eye view of Singapore. Take in the busy shipping lanes, the various city sights, all from the comfort and silent travel.screens located in the pod display the various attraction. Staff are very helpful and ensure the pods are not overloaded. Don鈥檛 miss this treat.",,,
,,AMAZING,5,,"We bought Singapore Slings ticket, which was premium, included Sling drink, separated entrance, and we enjoyed it in a private cabin. We went there at night around 8.30pm , we can see the gorgeous Singapore scenery , the glowing trees ( this one was attractive), the marina bay sands, ... everything all around Singapore
This is a must destination!!!! So beautiful!",,,
,,You鈥檝e got to do it!,5,,"Don鈥檛 be put off if you are afraid of heights. I鈥檓 not but did feel a bit jittery standing near the edges of our viewing carriage. You will be fine if you remain seated and may even venture towards the windows.

Amazing view which gave us a totally different perspective of the bay areas and marina. We took some amazing photos.

Very well organised. Would recommmend.",,,
,,Asia鈥檚 tallest observation wheel offers spectacular views,4,,"OMG . . . Does every major world city need a Ferris Wheel? I didn鈥檛 count exactly, But I must have seen Ferris wheels in over ten cities in 2018. That said, the Flyer offers great panoramic views of Singapore. It is 541 feet in height and has 28 capsules, each with a maximum capacity of 28 passengers. We did not have to wait for our ride. There was essentially no queue. Being that it opened in 2008, possibly the novelty has worn somewhat off. We went in the afternoon. Night views are likely incredibly more amazing.",,,
,,Highlight of the trip for my daughter,4,,I thought it was an impressive ride. There was a bit of a wait to get on on the day we went. A little bit on the expensive side $33 per person and the trip lasts 40mins. There was no information or audio on the ride which might have been useful to orientate tourists like ourselves. I probably would not have gone had it not been for my daughter's persistance.,,,
,,Night Time Flyer,5,,"We had a 10% discount on the price because we travelled by Singapore airways so the cost was 30 dollars each , we took the trip at night with all the lights. On our visit we only had 12 to a pod and only a very short Q to get on. The ride last about 30 minutes and you get a great view of place",,,
,,Enjoyable ride,5,,The cabin was surprisingly large n queue wasn't that long. We had a nice time going up n down as sun set. Perfect for photos of marina bay itself,,,
,,Great view,4,,We paid around $100 for a family of four! Great views but no better than from our hotel room and it takes around 30 min.,,,
,,Interesting Experience,4,,"At the ripe old age of 70 + i had never ventured on a Wheel of this size before and with the Flyer being in the worlds top 3 i am pleased we took the opportunity it was interesting to say the least although it will be awsome when the Singqpore night skyline comes to life
Organisation smooth running and Security were very impressive",,,
,,Amazing view,5,,We decided to go on the flyer and we were not disappointed. The view is spectacular with great photo opportunities of Singapore. It only takes 30 minutes and we are now thinking of doing it in the night. Must do,,,
,,Nice way to see the city,5,,"Recently went on the Flyer at night to see the city lit up. We had a good experience. We picked the time close to when the light show over the bay is so it was crowded and we did have to wait a bit longer to get on. The Flyer has 28 pods that can carry up to 28 people at a time. They only filled up the pods with 12 people which was nice because we didn't have to fight with a crowd to see the views. I think this made the ride more enjoyable. In London, the Eye was so crowded, we didn't get as long a time by the glass to view and there was no place to sit while you waited to see the views. On the Flyer, we had lots of time and space to view the city from every angle and sit when we wanted. It was worth waiting a bit longer to have more room in the pods. The city is nice to view at night and there is great information available so you know what and where you are looking. It was worth the S$30 and if you are in Singapore, I suggest you see the city this way, day or night.",,,
,,Had a Private Cabin,5,,"I had booked a premium ticket with Singapore Sling. To my surprise, we were the only ones for 6:30 pm slot. Got the entire cabin to ourselves. Had an amazing family time with a drink and nuts. My son was playing all over. Got the best-unobstructed view and pictures.",,,
,,Perfekt view,5,,It is really worth the price. 33$ p.p. And you have the best view in Singapore. They make it even better by not letting too many people to make a crowd.,,,
,,A must do in Singapore,4,,The Singapore flyer offers a 360deg view of the marina bay & the city during the 30 min ride. There is a small shopping centre & a garden to chill after the ride.,,,
,,Good Views,5,,"Good views and decent price. Not a very long wait. Limited number per pod, so good for us anxious people.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"We took the Flyer in the evening and it provided a great view of Singapore by night. It is a terrific way to get a sense of the city, though because of the buildings seeing beyond them was difficult.",,,
,,Awesome view,5,,Awesome view of Singapore skyline. A beautiful sight & a great experience. U can wine at the TOP of the world too.馃挅馃寛 馃尰,,,
,,Good experience,4,,"Great views of the city and Singapore Harbour with the mass of container ships,oil tankers and other vessels,couldnt really fault it",,,
,,One of the better Great Wheels in the world.,5,,"For some odd reason, this year (2018) has been the 5th year in a row that I have been on a Great Wheel somewhere in the world. I would rate the Singapore Flyer as one of the better ones that I have been on. We went during the day and didn鈥檛 have to wait at all. For that reason, I think I鈥檒l give it the nod over the London Eye. It is also easy to reach as the Hop on Hop off tourist buses stop here. I would definitely add this to my list of things to do while in Singapore.",,,
,,Awesome Views,5,,"One of the best places to view the skyline of this amazing city, ensure that you book your seats in advance they tend to be sold out in peak holiday seasons.",,,
,,A great way to get a sense of the city - would recommend,5,,We did this on my first trip to Singapore. It's a great way to see the whole city at once. We went during the day and it was a very smooth experience - no real queue at all. The interactive information in each capsule is very helpful. And the capsules are air conditioned - something we looked up before we went!,,,
,,Superb view and definitely worth the queue!,4,,"The large shuttles (bigger then the London Eye ones) provide you sufficient space to walk round and take pictures from all angles of the spectacular view. Go late evening, close to closing hours, when queues are shorter and views even more spectacular.",,,
,,Best to view Singapore in night,5,,"The attraction closes by 10 pm so get early, A nice flyer which offers a mesmerizing view of the city overlooking the river, gardens by the bay and Marina Bay Sands. Definitely recommended to do in Singapore, for all ages.",,,
,,Just a Birds eyes view!,4,,Worth a ride but probably just once. The view is specacular on a clear day. Cant say much other than that.,,,
,,No need to book,5,,Decided to chance this as we hadn't booked - surprised that it wasn't busy - got tickets straight away and walked right on. Amazing views - interactive tablets very informative and pod totally clean. Even gift shop was reasonably priced.,,,
,,Wonderful Views from Clever Positioning,5,,"This is not a ""ho hum"" experience. It is a truly interesting tourist experience that gives you a wonderful perspective on Singapore. The cabins are large and spacious and you can move around easily and see everything. We went just before dusk and as the experience takes about 40 minutes to revolve you can see the city as the sun goes down and the lights come on. Do your homework and research dusk at the time you travel. Its worth it. Also allow a little bit of time to work out the confusing way to the boarding area.",,,
,,Singapore flyer or marina bay skydeck,3,,"If you love to go on a ferris wheel and enjoy the view of the bay area, then you must go for this. Personally I preferred to go on marina bay skypark due to some reasons,i.e., no time limit on stay and you won鈥檛 be...More",,,

,,A great view of Singapore,5,,"The are best time to visit the Singapore Flyer, is in the morning when the light is great for a view across the Bay and Marina Bay, or in the early evening when the lights of the City are spectacular. Very much in a similar...More",,,
,,A must do when in singapore,4,,Make sure you go before dusk and you will see the lights come on. Some great views can be seen from the flyer. Would recommend to all travellers.,,,
,,Singapore Ferris Wheel 165m,3,,Definitely recommend doing this at night to enjoy the city and harbour lights. The boarding cues are hidden which reminded me of Theme Parks around the world. Over 1hr lined up before actual 30min trip. Edge pod is air conditioned so it was a very...More,,,
,,Busy at sunset,4,,"We went on a Saturday evening and it was very busy. We had hoped to see the sunset, but by the time we lined up and queued, we pretty much missed all of the dusk light. So go early to get in the lines if...More",,,
,,"A good attraction, with a queue",4,,"I recently visited the Singapore flyer while on a short trip to Singapore. The price is very reasonable for the type of attraction, and the experience on the wheel itself is very good, lasting around 30 minutes. We were accompanied by 2 other families in...More",,,
,,Giant wheel giving you the view of Singapore,4,,Its a slow giant wheel that gives you the full view of singapore. the tickets were little expensive but it was worth for a single use,,,
,,Fabulous!,5,,Fantastic views & if you time your visit at dusk you can see some in daylight & then get the full effect of the city by night which is something special. The kids were being 鈥榯eenagers鈥?so not as in awe as us oldies but...More,,,
,,Good experience,3,,Overall experience was pretty okay. The entire round takes about 30-40 minutes and gives you a great view. Do try to visit during evening or night time.,,,
,,Spectacular viewing from a very stable capsule.,5,,The capsule is very stable & you would hardly know you are moving. There is a capsule & package for meals & another for champagne. Views are spectacular & commentary is informative.,,,
,,Put it in your schedule,5,,"Before the sun set, we visited the flyer .. it was a good timing .. no long waiting .. the pictures talks",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Fantastic attraction. 30 minutes round 'flight' to view this incredible city. 360 views, something in every direction.",,,
,,Majestic view of the city,4,,I went with family and enjoyed the bird's eye view of the city at night. The trip takes about 20 minutes and turns slowly enough for you to maximise the time to enjoy the different angles you can take from the wheel to see the city.,,,
,,great view but marina sand bay view is better,3,,"I find this place boring.
When i entered the places, not much crowd/queue was there in weekend's afternoon. ticket costed 33$ per adult. I find this expensive as the flyer itself is not so much interesting. I would recommend to visit Marina Sand Bays hotel top floor that Singapore flyer.",,,
,,Pleasant surprise,5,,"I wasn't expecting much from this attraction, I just thought it's just be a bigger London Eye, however, it is SO much better.

Firstly, we struck lucky, or maybe it's always like this, but there was no queue despite it being a gloriously sunny afternoon. The wheel is very high and as a result you get superb views across the bay, marina and city.

It was one of the highlights of our time in Singapore.",,,
,,Try and see when the sun goes down,4,,"A complete rotation takes around half and hour and I planned it so that the sun went down while we were on boar, meaning we could
see Singapore in daylight and also see many places starting to light up. We were lucky enough to have a pod for just the 4 of us which made it even better, but this will depend on what time you visit and how busy it is. You get a wonderful view of Singapore and there are screens in the pod to give you more information.
Definitely worth doing",,,
,,PAN-TASTIC VIEW,5,,"Went to the flyer with family and totally enjoyed an hour full of fantastic view of Singapore. While a full slow rotation of this giant wheel you can have a glance at the f1 race track, gardens by the bay, bayfront, 7star marina bay sands and the endless scenic beauty of singapore. Do make a wish when your pod reaches the toppest point, your wish might get completed, it's a saying.",,,
,,Flyer,5,,Flyer singapore NiCe to seen Top view of singapore Nice slow ride of flyer Good one Must seen all U have to this place and seen singapore top view,,,
,,Awesome view of Singapore,5,,"Was a great way to see Singapore. Make sure weather is ok before going as the view might not be great if cloudy. No need to pre book we got tickets on the day and lines were short, they didn鈥檛 fill up
Capsule to maximum so was plenty of room.",,,
,,Superb Singapore Flyer,5,,Singapore Flyer is an other great experience to do. You can see the whole bay from the 360 view pod. You can even hire dinner or party pods. At the top it鈥檚 165 metres tall and you can see for miles around. The ride takes half an hour and the gift shop has amazing souvenirs with a good price you will find no where else. There are a couple of bad things about the prices. For a private pod it鈥檚 1000 Singapore dollars each.,,,
,,Last minute plan - Loved it!!!!,5,,We were at the end of our Singapore holiday and had some time off in the evening of the previous day we were leaving. We were at Little India and took the MRT to promenade station. It was 5 mins walk from the MRT and was not crowded at all. We bought the tickets (SGD 33) at the counter and headed straight to the Ferris wheel - NO waiting time. It takes 30 mins for one complete rotation. The view was awesome and recorded commentary helps you locate landmarks that can be viewed from the flyer. This is highly recommended.,,,
,,Awesome Views and nicer I think at night,5,,Just a great way to get a great view of the city. At night the lights are amazing and you really get a super view of all the key sites in the city. Its not cheap if its a family but its worth it.,,,
,,Iconic,4,,The Singapore Flyer is an iconic landmark. The views are great. a must see in singapore. We had a nice time here.,,,
,,A Perfect End To Our Holiday,5,,"My husband and I recently visited Thailand and Singapore and decided to end our holiday with dinner on the Singapore Flyer. What a good choice we made. We enjoyed a four-course dinner and had the luck of having the capsule to ourselves for half of the 1-hour flight. We chose the Western Menu and the food was delicious. We were also very impressed with the efficiency of the whole operation. We were taken up to the capsule by the Flyer staff which avoided any queuing. Our Starter and Appetiser were served during the first 30-minute rotation, with the Main Course and Desert delivered to our capsule for the second rotation. And then there was the view. We chose the 8:30 pm flight time which showcased the Singapore City night lights. It really was spectacular.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,This is one of the biggest ferris wheels in the world and here you can see the amazing views of Singapore harbor.,,,
,,Spectacular views!,5,,"Did the flyer right before a thunderstorm hit and wow am I glad we made it. It gives you a great perspective on singapore and is, itself, so close to other major attractions in Singapore that it will barely take you out of your way.",,,
,,Magnificent view of the city,5,,"The view in the day will definitely be different that the view during the night. I was fortunate to be able to view both! It is definitely not a fast ride. It moves slowly and you could enjoy the view sitting down or even standing up. For those who would like more information about the buildings and landscapes could even use the ipads! In the sturdy large pods, you can view the sea, the Singapore River, the Marina Bay area and many more. When the night engulfed the city, the lights coloured the surroundings and present to you a different perspective of Singapore. A unique experience to be higher than most in the city.",,,
,,Fantatic views,5,,"Took about 40 minutes in a pod, fantastic views of Singaore, about 20 Singapore dollars. Seating in pod of required, very similar to the London Eye",,,
,,Breathtaking view,5,,"Take the flyer at night where you can enjoy the beautiful light adorning the city. You can purchase your tickets directly at the place itself. Also, there are many 'old school' eateries where you can enjoy the local food.",,,
,,Not a thrill seekers ride..,4,,"Nice little ride. This giant wheel, while not thrilling , moves slow enough to give you a wonderful perspective of this great city. The ride is comfortable, managed very well, and cost and wait times are reasonable. This 'birds eye view"" ride is well worth the time and effort.",,,
,,Late Morning Ride Was Great,5,,We purchased the rides on the Flyer has part of a package that included GBTB and a gelato offered by a well known tour company as it provided excellent value. I recommend the day ride as it gives you a chance to actually see where all the local attractions actually are placed and the views are excellent. Our late Thursday morning ride time was very quiet and easy to access the Flyer. I really think they need to revamp their website though as it is one of the most difficult to find out what you want to know.,,,
,,Unique experience,4,,"We took the flyer ride in the night after the Marina Bay Sands Skypark visit. This shows us the night skyline and a real 360 degree view while in air.
We were lucky to be given a flyer cabin for just 3 of us.
It is worth visiting, but is bit costly..",,,
,,Those views!,5,,"You can not book a time to go on the flyer, you just rock up whenever which we felt a little concerned about. Luckily for us there was no que when we got there so we walked straight on, but I can imagine it being a little frustrating if there was a certain time you wanted to go and there were alot of people there waiting. The views from the Flyer are amazing and worth every penny! Takes 30 mins to go around and you get 360 degree views of the city and surrounds. We went during the night and it was amazing!",,,
,,Great Ride,5,,"It was a Wonderful Ride. We have been on the London Eye to Las Vegas Farris Wheel, and it is a Wonderful way to see the whole City, just wish my night pictures came out better. But a Fun way to see the City",,,
,,Night Time Views!,5,,"Decided to try this experience at night and definitely think we made the right decision. The views were amazing! If you are going for a standard ticket, you can't prebook a time so keep that in mind if you want to see something in particular.",,,
,,Perfect!,5,,Was a great way to see Singapore and a good way to orientate ourselves on the first day of our visit. I would definitely recommend to anyone going to Singapore.,,,
,,Great over view,4,,"This is the best way to see across Singapore, the Flier is easy to find. There was not much a a queue when we arrived and we were soon rising up to take a birds eye view of Singapore. We had been on the flier 5 years ago and we were just as impressed this time with the experience. Great way to see over the bay and suitable for all ages",,,
,,Best View of the City,5,,"I cannot say enough good things about the Flyer! It might seem pricey, but really - the view of the city is astounding. It can be romantic in the evening and a capsule adventure by day. (My friend and I went twice!) Just Do It when you're in",,,
,,Simply amazing...,5,,Fantastic view of the city skyline from the glass capsules fitted in a iconic giant wheel. Bit expensive but every worth of money spent. Not to be missed.,,,
,,Best way to capture The Cityscapes of Singapore,4,,"If you see there's a long queuing line, don't worry, it will move forward faster than you think. Best way to capture the cityscapes of Singapore, especially in the evening",,,
,,Acrophobia,4,,The view of the city skyline from the top of the tallest flyer in the world was simply majestic! Definitely one for the bucket list and worth experiencing at least once!,,,
,,Spectacular,5,,Spectacular view from the tallest flyer in the world! Singapore looks beautiful with all the lights at night! We could see Gardens by the Bay and all other beautiful landmarks from up there. Worth experiencing at least once.,,,
,,A World Class BIG Wheel...,5,,"My wife and I love to go to the viewing levels of tall buildings and ride panoramic big wheels 鈥?and the Singapore Flyer is one seriously BIG wheel.

At 165 metres (541 feet) above the sea the Singapore Flyer gives the rider a wonderful view of the city. It takes around 30 minutes to complete the full rotation of the wheel, enough time to take in all the sights and take as many photos as you please.

Each capsule can take a maximum of 28 passengers in comfort and with plenty of viewing space. And the ride is so smooth you hardly notice that you鈥檙e travelling.

This really is a truly marvellous engineering construction and a great tourist attraction. Well done Singapore.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"It was fun visiting singapore flyer. You may think that you have got a great view if you have visited MBS Rooftop or 1 Altitude, but SG Flyer definitely is still worth visiting as the view is really good. best time to visit is around subset, so that you can see sunset as well as the city lights.",,,
,,SINGAPORE WITH DK TRAVELS,5,,"Great Destination Great Vacation. Wonderful country to go to. Go solo, go couples, go friends, go family : very warm welcome by Singaporeans",,,
,,Amazing View,5,,Went with my friend from the Middle East and the view was fantastic with sunny sky. The staffs were friendly and helpful as my friend came with the family that had toddler.,,,
,,Great view from atop,5,,My family loved the ride and there was only 7 of us in the capsule. We went on a weekday and there was no waiting time. Great view of the city and sea.,,,
,,A slow way up and down and the views are pretty good.,3,,"Unfortunately, we lost the ability to romance the Singapore Skyscape because of two young, extremely loud and inconsiderate Chinese females who spent the entire ride yelling unbearably into their mobile phones in Mandarin. Sadly for us, we couldn't open the door and take the quick way down. The whole trip up and down was great for photo opportunities but, in hindsight, you get exactly the same view from the top of the Marina Bay Sands Skywalk.",,,
,,Great view of the city,4,,It is high!! Very slowly about 40 minutes to complete in large comfortable enclosed cages. Do it even if you are afraid of heights,,,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,Brilliant views. Air conditioned. Takes 30 minutes but you can see everything. We used the trip to also navigate to our next stop. One of our trip highlights.,,,
,,High in the sky!,5,,"Amazing ride 165 meters up in the air. The view is spectacular over Gardens by the bay, Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Bay Area. Daytime it was short time to wait in line.",,,
,,Absolute stunning view,5,,"I got a chance to revisit Singapore Flyer with my family this time and I absolutely loved every bit of it. The best part was there was a small drizzle during that evening and whole premises was decorated for Christmas.My suggestion visit flyer during evening as you can experience illuminations across the city.

Most important part my parents were with us and we requested flyer staff that they cannot walk till flyer,the staff member escorted us till elevator till flyer capsule.So warm, so courteous.Dont miss this, must go.",,,
,,Kids loved it,5,,"Mainly went on for children, bit pricey just for a spin in a wheel. Lovely views and the view of the shipping lanes was amazing.",,,
,,Great views,4,,Great views but ensure you go to the toilet first! It鈥檚 betete to come here around sunset so you can see the city change from daylight to night lights.,,,
,,Worth Doing at Least Once,4,,"Our family enjoyed a revolution on the Singapore Flyer early one weekday morning. We were blessed with a very small wait and a cabin with a very small number of people in it.
The views were stunning and it was great to see a different view of the city!",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,It was a spectacular view from the Marina Sand Bay Sand building then walk a few minutes to the site. It was excellent.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"It takes around 40 minutes to get around, enough time for you to get excellent views of the skyline, gardens and all the city A must do while in Singapore",,,
,,FLYER - Giant Marry go round,4,,"Amazing view at flyer. It's moving so slowly so anybody can take a ride of it. It will take 35 minutes to complete the one round. fantastic view of Singapore city on flyer.

If you have lack of time and planing of visit sky park then you can avoid.",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"I went there alone on the first day of my fourth Singapore trip as this was not there during my last visit in 2010. It is quite walkable if you are at Merlion Park or if you鈥檙e staying at any bay hotel. Furthermore, make sure you go during sunset so you get all the amazing views of the bay area as well as Gardens by the Bay. One ferris wheel platform carries 28 passengers so don鈥檛 worry about being left alone.",,,
,,Great scenic viewing,5,,Spent 30-40 minutes here one afternoon and it was well worth the money and the time. The ride takes approx 30 minutes and has s running commentary...the view is spectacular and a great photo op.,,,
,,Top highs top attraction,5,,Superb !!! The views from the Flyer are spectacular. We shared our pod with a family from India who where fab. You see so many of the sights you鈥檒l be visiting. To be looking down onto the F1 grid and the Bay turns was definitely one of the highlights of this trip to Singapore and Vietnam. Get there early before the bus loads of people start arriving.,,,
,,Highlight of trip,5,,"This is a must for visitors! Great views, top point is the height of a 42 storey building. Wonderful overview of the whole of Singapore and view to Malaysia.
Info and commentary provided on iPads in carriages which are clean and well designed.
Staff were very helpful and caring and access was good for people with mobility limitations.
Worth a visit.",,,
,,Worth for the veiw,4,,Had been ther at night and must say it's worth watching the view from top a lil expansive but worth it 33 dollers I guess Singapore currency,,,
,,O What a View,4,,The view was fabulous and fortunately on the day was not too busy. On busy times the ride and experience might be very crowded and noisy. So pick your time carefully. I was disappointed to find seniors - being tourists were not entitled to reduced fares. they only apply to locals - not very encouraging for tourists.,,,
,,360 views,5,,Singapore flyer is absolutely a must visit with incredible views all around Singapore. The ride is approximately 30-40 minutes and is very slow which allows you time to take in the views and take plenty of pictures! Tickets are $33SGD but definitely worth it.,,,
,,Seeing the sights atop Singapore,5,,"Absolute bliss wheel chair no problems for the staff.our party of four adults ,three over 67 one being in a wheel chair .
We were taken to the entry point by a staff member no fuss and we were on board and going within 5 minutes. 5:30pm was great time as we had both daylight and night to see the lights of the CBD.
Great way to see Singapore from above.
SINGAPORE FLYER FABULOUS THANK YOU.",,,
,,Anticipate taking lots of photos.,5,,"With 360 degree views, no matter which direction you face, there will be something you will want to photograph as a reminder of this spectacular occasion.
The structure itself, the masses of ships anchored in the harbour, Marina Bay Sands Skypark and the Supertrees, the city skyline, and ""Selfies"".",,,
,,Great view,4,,This is a must do for tourists. It didnt cost alot and i got to see a 360 degree view of the city and it was fun,,,
,,Great view of Singapore,5,,I think the best time to go is dusk when the city lights are starting to come on. The price is expensive but worth it. The ride lasted approximately 45 minutes.,,,
,,Visit to Singapore Flyer,5,,Amazing experience! Breathe taking 360鈥?view of Beautiful Singapore and skyscrapers like Marina Bay Sands! From 541. ft.,,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,The location and scale of this flyer is great and we really enjoyed a relaxed experience and we had enough time to see all around and take some great photos. This is well worth a visit and pretty reasonable costs so if you want to get a different perspective on Singapore then this is a must do.,,,
,,Spectacular view,5,,"We had a delicious set dinner at the Pavilion before we took a VIP ride. The service was excellent. The view up there was amazing, with the nice display panels explaining what you see. It is spacious and you could walk around during the 30 min ride. Most memorable ride admiring the night view of Singapore. It must really spectacular during a fireworks display.",,,
,,Stunning!,5,,It鈥檚 a stunning 30-minute ride and you will see how beautiful Singapore skyline from above. Captivating!,,,
,,It was OK,3,,"Not being a fan of heights perhaps I should not write this review. It was OK but would certainly not be a ""must do"" for me.",,,
,,Great view,5,,The Singapore flyer is something that is definitely on a travelers must visit things in Singapore and I really enjoyed the great view of the City I got for that 30 minute ride. It was really worth the money and it also made my trip to Singapore memorable.,,,

,,Memorable experience,5,,Experience the serene view of the most happening city from the flyer - awesome after sunset - the lion city with lights!,,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,This was complimentary with our Grand Prix race tickets Zone 1 and we would highly recommend doing this even if you have to pay. The views are amazing and you can see for miles around you. The highlight for use was seeing the track intermingling within the main roads etc and how well it's put together for the racing weekend. The movement around the wheel is so effortless and the pods are brilliant and spacious. Loved the experience and seeing the views from above. A must if your visiting Singapore.,,,
,,Awesome Place to be in,5,,"This is the only flyer in the world from where you can see 3 countries (Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia). It gives amazing view of the city and is a must go place",,,

,,Amazing,5,,The wheel is amazing and so lovely at nigh its a must place to visit if you come to Singapore. People are so Findley and it is very easy to get a taxi which have cheap rates.,,,
,,Wasted of them for 30 min which the view was so much different 5 year ago,1,,Very bad experience view been block by marina bay sand no really recommend to do at night if want see night view got rent a scooter is more worth it,,,

,,Excellent view of city,4,,Nice view of city from flyer.Big cabins. It takes around 35 minutes for a revolution. You hardly feel it moving.,,,
,,Good but not the best way to spend time,3,,Everything was ok. The ride is maintained well and the view is splendid. However it takes just 40minutes and im not sure if it is worth the price,,,
,,wow what a view,4,,singapore night lights are best seen on the flyer. marvelous view and breathtakingly sweet. nothing much can compare to it when you are on the top,,,
,,Brave girl.,5,,One thing I hate is heights but this is a must. This was my second time and I had more confidence to move about and see the views. Wow. It is amazing how much and how far you see. My only complaint would be the costly shop and staff that hassled you as you were browsing. A good old stare and rebuke stopped this.,,,
,,Great family experience!,5,,"A little tip. Board right after the sun dips into the horizon, so you can get some pretty good light against the city skyline.",,,
,,Visit with kids,5,,"We visited the flyer with our 3 children (16,16,10). It is a relaxing ride. We really enjoyed it. I would like to do it again in the afternoon and enjoy the night lights.",,,
,,Nice viewsI,5,,Please remember that bad weather does stop entrance for the viewing. I went on a day when there was lightning so we were on delay for 1 hr. The views are incredible but I recommend sunset to get some good views. This is the equivalent of The High Roller from Las Vegas.,,,
,,The capsule experience !!!,5,,"A good idea to get an aerial view of the city is the Singapore flyer which accommodates you into small capsules fitted on the flyer (giant ferris wheel) which moves upward slowly giving you plenty of time to observe the city from a various heights in the air.
One can have an aeriel view of F1 grand prix race if you happen to be in the flyer on a race day.
Tickets can be bought at the ticket office.
Tourists travelling with Singapore airlines are offered a discount of 10% which is a big bonus.
The Singapore flyer takes approx. 30 mins to complete the ride.",,,
,,Singapore Night View,5,,"Best place to check out Singapore at Night, best view from 165 meters. Entrance fee 33 SGD for adult. Don鈥檛 forget to bring your camera",,,
,,Amazing Experience,5,,"Singapore Flyer is a great experience and way to have a view of the entire country and borders ... It鈥檚 a must visit in the evening and a complete 30 minute of pure fun... People who fear heights need to try because it鈥檚 safe , fun and at the same time gives you a very secured feeling at an awesome height of about 500+feet ... Enjoy with one and all and have a blast ...",,,
,,Singapore Sling package,5,,This experience is wonderful at dusk to take in the beautiful night lights of Singapore. It takes approximately 30 minutes to go full circle and is very relaxing. The cabs on the Flyer are very well appointed for comfort.,,,
,,A round in Singapore Flyer,5,,"you can have a good look of Singapore from the top of flyer round. At top point you can see Singapore-island of Malaysia & Indonesia. in the round you can see all top attractions of Singapore. if you like to spend a Romantic evening, book a dining car in night for two rounds. there are lots of others activities and dining places in the same premises. The other main attraction of Singapore are also near by.",,,
,,Great but expensive,5,,"Worth the trip, but expensive! For a family it would be a significant expense! But I enjoyed the views, It was a nice relaxing Way to see the city, but if you dont like heights, then dont.",,,
,,Kinda pricey,4,,"Very good view especially at night. However the ticket price is not cheap ,if u really wanna buy ,I would advise u buy from klook ,much cheaper than buying on the spot",,,
,,Good view,4,,"Excellent view of Singapore's skyline. Take a 15mins raise to the peak and indulge yourself to the vibrant city. Clear your bladder before going for your flight. And recommend for night view instead of day, as sun is glaring into the capsules.",,,
,,Average,3,,"Had to walk quite a way to get to it , windows were steamed up with the humidity so restrictive of being able to take photos ,does give you a good feel of the vast area and buildings , not sure if it鈥檚 worth the 30 s dollars",,,
,,Unique landmark,4,,"This is symbolic with Singapore from where one can have a complete view of the city. Unfortunately when I visited, it was not operational as it was under maintenance but still a nice place to visit. We also enjoyed Indian food there.",,,
,,singapore flyer is one of the top things you should go for a ride,5,,"singapore flyer is one of the top things you should go for a ride you can see singapore from a high point , you can go in day light so u can see the country clearly and if you go at night u can see the country fabulous lights",,,
,,See Singapore from a huge height !,4,,This one is just a copy of London Eye although there is hardly any que in a working day . The journey is quite fascinating as we see the Marina Bay from the Glass door and the Singapore River with the huge buildings on their sides and the motor ways...during evening the lighting of the buildings and city is terrific! Carry your Singapore or silk air boarding passes to get 10% discount on the tickets.,,,
,,Top View of Singapore,5,,It is similar to London Eye. Ride is about 20-25 min. You get ample time for scenic view of Singapore. Don't forget to take a boat ride and a visit to miniature Merlion.,,,
,,Short break,3,,Fine once you鈥檙e on the wheel but the surrounding facilities were lacking. Once on the wheel it takes about half an hour to go round and it鈥檚 very clean inside each pod. Overall recommended.,,,
,,Great view,4,,"At over 500鈥?above sea level it鈥檚 quite the view. I went in evening to see the lights. There was not a line. I think it was about $25s. It takes about thirty minutes, and does not stop to load or unload but it moves very slow so it鈥檚 easy. You could get stroller on at that speed.",,,
,,worth it,5,,its such an exquisite experience. to see the world from high above. lots to c and to relax. very comfortable,,,
,,Amazing Views over City of Singapore and the Harbour!,5,,"I was so worried as I am usually getting sick of heights, but I really wanted to see Singapore from the top. It goes very slow, I didn't really feel much moving, no swinging or anything. We were lucky, it was a Tuesday, early afternoon. There was no long waiting, approx. 5-10 min., Ticket cost 33.00 SGD p.Adult, takes around 30min. We were 7 person together in one cabin. We didn't book in advance because we wanted to wait for a day with clear skies. As Singapore has a tropic climate, the weather can change easily and start raining. It was a great experience. Amazing views. Definatly a must do!",,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,Excellent views.awesome experience.try to visit in the evening time just when lights will go live.capsule is well maintained and made of tough glass,,,
,,The flyer,4,,"We thoroughly enjoyed this trip. We went during the daytime and the weather wasn鈥檛 bright and clear, so we didn鈥檛 see the city at its best, however we were nevertheless very impressed.

I suspect though, that it might be even more impressive during a clear evening.

It is recommended.",,,
,,Great Views,4,,"Great views of Singapore attractions, the city and as far as Malaysia and Indonesia. Amazing to see huge number of ships littered in the water.",,,
,,A must do whilst in Singapore!,5,,"Loved every minute of this.....we did a daytime visit but can imagine it would also be spectacular at night. Beautiful gardens and fishponds, great little restaurants and a spa where you can get your feet nibbled by fish!!",,,
,,A Very Big Ferris Wheel!,3,,"We enjoyed the Singapore Flyer, but it certainly wasn't the highlight of our trip. It provides great views of the Marina Bay area and the surrounding harbor.",,,
,,The High Life!,5,,"This was our final day, before we went to the airport. Gave us a great overview of the city and the harbour",,,
,,"Sit Down, Hold On, Ignore your Cabin mates",3,,"I will preface this review with ""I don't like heights!"" so the first thing I did was sit down and hold on. Why did I do it? Singapore Flyer has great views on Singapore, the harbour, the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay etc etc. We easily entered a huge glass encased capsule after a short wait in line. There were three of us and another Chinese family of 8. I will say only that the whole family were all loud, argumentative and aggressive when it came to seats and standing in front of people trying to look at the view. Not much you can do about it except enjoy yourself otherwise. And I did enjoy the view from the relative safety of my seat, even when we were going over the top of the ferris wheel so high in the sky with seemingly only a few metal spikes holding us up - what was I thinking!!! For those who are height-a-phobes, sit still, hold on, and enjoy the experience, its is a good one in hindsight.",,,
,,Singapore EYE!!!!!,5,,"Great way to see Sinagpore. The giant wheel is neat and clean, with 30 min of ride , gives you ample time to see and admire the beauty of Singapore. Family enjoyed thourughly with lot of time for clicking pics and i suggest its must for anyone travelling to Singapore. I preferred day over night to see the place.",,,
,,Slow round,3,,The flyer Moves too slowly..u won't even feel that it's moving...u can enjoy the Singapore from top anx it's amazing big buildings ...,,,
,,Great view,4,,Went on the Flyer cost 66 Singapore Dollars around 拢40. The view were lovely with useful information video as you travel round. Quite expensive for what it was.,,,
,,Modern Masterpiece,5,,"The Flyer is absolutely amazing, it is state of the art moving Giant. If you are in Singapore you just can't miss this.",,,
,,Grand view of whole Singapore,5,,"So first who are afraid of a ride of Giant wheel, be relaxed. It is a slow speed capsule ride, & takes around 30 minutes to complete the whole round. It costs around $25 per person.
So glass capsule gives ample view & time for photography.
It is done when your travel agent will take you to city tour. Mostly package doesn鈥檛 include it, so better ask your agent to include it in package",,,
,,Overcoming fear of heights,5,,I'm very afraid of heights so this was quite an effort for me. I shouldn't have worried at all. When inside the capsule you don't feel any movement. I was here in the evening with the spectacular light show all around me.You can remain seated or move around to take photos. Highly recommend this.,,,
,,can see Singapore over view,5,,"I got on this flyer at first Singapore day. This flyer is very nice speed, panorama view and safety. I could see Singapore over view and be impressed the growth city.",,,
,,Fabulous,5,,"Wonderful time spent here, the facility was super clean, staff and visitors were very friendly, I had my photo taken with several of our pod group. The view from the pod was awesome, even my husband (who hates heights) enjoyed looking straight out of the pod, but not down.
Well worth the time.",,,
,,Skip Marina Bay and do this,5,,This is a lovely activity to do day or night. A little scary watching your child press themselves against the glass but other than that a great view and fun to see how high you are getting. The computers on board point out key city places and the views are amazing. We got to see a big cruise ship depart at night whilst on the Flyer.,,,
,,Excellent view,5,,Good view from the top and all safety measures are taken care of. One must visit with family/friends,,,
,,Another London eye,5,,"Everywhere you go has a wheel and pods. Hong Kong, Sydney both follow this trend. It's a cheaper price and longer ride than London. Great value and family friendly. Try it well worth the timr",,,
,,Good Experience,5,,Fun and Excitement to go with family .Best use of of Technology and Perfection.Must go place in singapore.,,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,Singapore flyer is worth experiencing and is value for money. It is good to ride in evening. I really enjoyed with my family,,,
,,"Vist to Singapore Flyer, Giant wheel",5,,It was a great experience specifically as we did it just after sunset. You get a lovely view from the top and see the iconic buildings around raffles place. The best time to take the ride is after sunset. We got to see the light show of the gardens by the bay from the flyer,,,
,,Views,5,,The Singapore flyer is spectacular and for the $30 is well worth it ... you spend half an hour slowly going up and with a commentary and iPad on board you can take in the 360c views ofSingapore a 45 mile radius . Fully airconditioned . Spectacular for photo taking ...,,,
,,Alan,5,,Amazing. Could see the whole of Singapore the harbour was spectacular with the amount ships . Definitely must do,,,
,,Sightseeing Up High,5,,Had a 9 hour stop over in Singapore so went into the city. Well worth doing this. Awesome way of seeing the city. Spectacular views. This is one way of seeing Singapore from up high. 360 views of the city. We were fortunate to get on before the weather changed which put a stop to people being able to get this experience. Highly recommend you making time to do this if in Singapore. There were not any queues so we got straight on.,,,
,,Great ride,5,,"Fantastic attraction second time around. We had a Singapore Sling booked, which offered us almost privet capsule. The views were amazing",,,
,,Singapore flyers,4,,"Very convenient and maintained. You can have Full 360 degree view of the city for the top.very safe, will not operate if whether does not permit.",,,
,,Great view,4,,Great way to see the city. Would be fantastic also at night. We were lucky to have only us in the pod so had the while thing to ourselves.,,,
,,High rise digntseeing,5,,"Well worth the money to catch a Birdseye view of Singapore
The weather was an issue at first as there was a storm looming so best done on a clear day
But with absolute 360 degree views of the city and ocean (so many ships parked off shore)
There are monitors in the cars to explain all the significant sights etc
And very high at the top
Great experience",,,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,This was amazing. If you want to see the Singapore skyline then this is the best view. 360 degree views and takes 30 minutes from start to finish. We did it at night and it was just so colourful. A very smooth ride.,,,
,,Great views,4,,"I travelled on the Singapore Flyer with my family on a very quiet weekday. The views over Singapore were excellent and the space in the gondola was very comfortable, but then it was not a busy day.",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"Absolutely fantastic. S$33 for approx 30 minutes of air conditioned comfort while viewing an amazing city. Loved seeing Gardens by the bay ,Grand Prix pits and river front from above. A must do experience.",,,
,,Great view of Marina area,4,,"You get a great view of the marina area, Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Very reasonably priced, and is very similar to the London Eye. Each pod has plenty of room.",,,
,,Great view of Singapore skyline,4,,"We were pretty amazed with the experience. My initial expectation was not very high with flyer but to my surprise it was really a nice experience. The best part is that you get a 360 degree view of Singapore skyline.
Best time in my opinion is between 5 to 7 PM as its a visual delight during this time and you can feel unparalleled enormity and beauty of Singapore as well.",,,
,,one of Best views Singapore,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is a giant Ferris wheel in Singapore.
visited 2 times with friend and family.

,,Great views of Singapore,5,,We came here after seeing the Singapore Flyer from Gardens on The Bay. The views as it goes round are spectacular. We timed it to coincide with sunset. That was definitely a great experience. I highly recommend the Singapore Flyer.,,,
,,Excellent views,5,,"To our amazement when we turned up to ride the Singapore Flyer there was no one in line and we got straight on and had a pod to ourselves. The views are spectacular and not to be missed. Our 2 and 4 year old girls absolutely loved it, as did we.",,,
,,Leisure Trip,4,,"The views from this are awesome! It's slightly taller than the London Eye (I think), but offers incredible 360 bird's eye views of the city. On a clear day, you can easily see Indonesia (some islands).
Only thing I can grumble is the value - the ride seems to be over quickly for the price paid (about 30+SG dollars). Overall a lovely experience especially if you like city views.",,,
,,Very slow,3,,It gives a good view but it's very slow. You kinda feel bored after a certain point to be just sitting inside,,,
,,Really beautiful.,5,,"The night time ride for us was lovely, seeing the city lights of Singapore, watching from a distance the light show on at the Supertrees Gardens. Just taking in the amazing view we could have sat there forever. I think it takes roughly 45 minutes to do the full circle of the ride.",,,
,,Amazing views but poorly organised,3,,"Once you are up - it is AMAZING! But getting up was such a saga. We made three visits and each time they were closed due to bad weather... yet some people seemed to be allowed on. We even rang their customer service line and asked if they were open, they said yes, yet were closed when we arrived 10 minutes later and told us they had been closed for more than an hour. We eventually worked out that if you purchased your tickets on your phone, they let you through - even if the ticket desk was closed! It's a great attraction but be aware of the organisation, very unlike Singapore.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,The wheel turns in a lazy speed that gives you all time to make amazing pictures an video's. The view is great . Maybe a little overshadowed by the Marina Sands hotel but a great experience,,,
,,Fantastick,5,,"We went to see the Flyer in day time then we were advised to come and see it at nite time, and that was something. We took so many pictures and enjoyed the beautiful view, it takes about 35- 40 min to get around. You have to see it do miss this !!!!",,,
,,Good sightings of other attractions,4,,Not that easy to get to on foot needs a few more signs and directions after SMRT stop. Shops and other attractions in the facility is not always in use so it feels a little run down. The experience itself is very good try go in the evening as it will be a different experiences with all the lights on in the darkness. Book on line as well it's cheaper.,,,
,,Sunset timing is best,5,,A longish walk took us to the Singapore flyer. But its worth waiting for those cabins to arrive and take you to see Singapore from a height. We saw the spectacular sunset in the Bay and had a glimpse of the stadium underneath where the F1 had just finished the previous day.,,,
,,A wonderful experience,5,,"I was nervous to say the least, but once inside and on the way, this was a tremendous experience and the views over Singapore are stunning. I went up in the daytime, very nice and again in the evening with all the beautiful colours of the lights reflecting on the Singapore River and from the buildings. Well worth the effort.",,,
,,Fly highh,4,,"Definitely worth visiting when you come to Singapore. At it's peak, you are able to have a birds eye view of the commercial estates. A very rare and appreciative sight to view from!",,,
,,You Fell Top Of The World,5,,"You really feel top of the world, its 30 minutes ride, very comfortable, safe, you keep going up slowly, and when on top you feel amazing.",,,
,,"Great view, but very expensive",4,,"It is SGD 33 for a short 20-30 minute ride on the Flyer. Fortunately, the flyer moves at a slow pace so that you can take in the views. It is worth visiting once, but it is extremely pricey.",,,
,,What a view of Singapore,5,,3 of us had our own capsule so was a great adventure. Excellent view of Singapore and surrounds and would definitely do once,,,
,,Great views,4,,This wheel gives you a great 360掳 view of Singapore. Spacious pods and there is a beautiful courtyard below the wheel.,,,
,,"Good for families, but Marina Bay Sands better for adult travelers",4,,"My husband and I went on the Singapore Flyer on a recent trip to Singapore and had a good experience. We went on a weekday - so no lines or wait for our turn and only one other person in our pod. The views were very nice and I could see how this would be a good activity for families, but we were a little bored after the first 15 minutes (ride is 35 min in total). Part of the issue was that we had just been at Marina Bay Sands which also has amazing views and so we had our fill of city landscape viewing. In comparing the two, I'd recommend the flyer for families and Marina Bay Sands for adults. You can take kids to Marina Bay Sands, but I think they would be more excited by a ferris wheel and the other attractions around the flyer. At the Sands, you can purchase either the option to just go to the viewing area for about $35.00 OR you can pay $20.00 to go to the Cie La Vie restaurant/bar and then your ticket price goes towards a drink or food item of your choice (both reasonably priced). Plenty of outdoor seating and spectacular views.",,,
,,It's OK nothing spectacular...one can skip,3,,"I think it is has been made a BIG HYPE. There is really nothing spectacular to spend SGD 33 per person for this unless you have been to a developed country for the first time. I would instead prefer to hire a bicycle or a battery operated cycle to roam around Marina Bay and explore the beauty. Well, it is an individual's choice at the end of the day.",,,
,,Great views over Marina Bay,5,,Even with the looming threat of thunderstorms the view of the Bay is magnificent. Great views and very comfortable experience 鈥?the Flyer moves very slowly so you hardly feel like it鈥檚 moving and have plenty of time to see the harbour.,,,
,,Great view,4,,This is a pretty large wheel. It has great views. I have done a few of the wheels on my travels and yhis one does not disappoint,,,
,,Great experience,5,,"Sooper and awesome experience in Singapore flyers, we had take this ride after 7 to enjoy the city lighting",,,
,,Fantastic view,5,,We roade the Singapore Flyer as part of our day tour with Monster Tours. I have been on the London Eye and this is larger. Queueing system moves quite fast and it is very easy to get on the pod. It is airconditioned and you cannot feel it move. Several time our group thought we had stopped it moved so effortlessly. The view is spectacular and I am so glad to have ridden the Flyer.,,,
,,Had my eyes closed,3,,"This is a good way to get to and around Santosa island. For those of us who don鈥檛 like heights it鈥檚 a nightmare. However, if you can open your eyes the views are great. A very smooth cable car.",,,
,,Great thrill and views over Singapore,5,,"We got to the Flyer from the MRT which I have to say wasn't as obvious or signposted as most other places are. However it is obviously visible from the MRT due to its size.
When we arrived there were announcements being made over the PA saying due to the bad weather it was closed. Oh dear......we decided to hang around where there isn't much more to see for half an hour and then luckily it reopened.
We bought our tickets easily, if a little pricey, and joined a short queue. I think we were very lucky the queue was so short as clearly the place is designed to cope with large volumes.
The capsules are spacious and due to the lack of visitors there were only 6 of us in it. They do hold up to 28, so moving around inside the capsule was easy.
It takes about 30 minutes to do the full 360 degrees and gives you a great view of the city. It's also very smooth when moving so you don't feel the motion and thus don't feel ill.
Another must to do in Singapore.",,,
,,Looks great,4,,We had wanted to try the Singapore Flyer but it was not operational for the four days that we were in town. It鈥檚 a pity as the views from the top must be magnificent.,,,
,,SLK,4,,"Did this at sunset and great as you slowly rotate to the top and get to see the city lights illuminate. Excellent views of whole of Singapore. There are a few options to choose from for this ride including a Singapore sling option and even dinner.
If your a small group 2 to 6 people you will sometimes get your own cabin.",,,
,,A full view of City!,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is rightly placed. As you start going up, you start getting a view of the whole city. And the evening views are terrific! The cabins are very nice. Must visit.",,,
,,Sunset from the top,5,,"The best time of the day to enjoy the ride is just before sunset, so you can experience the night lights as well as the stunning views of the distant islands during the day light and of course the lovely scene of sun setting.
The cubicle was comfortable 鈥?ac was good, chairs were good.
Though my second visit, yet because I鈥檓 trying a different time it felt like first.
I don't think you can get bored of it ... worth trying on every visit",,,
,,Something to do while on a stopover,4,,"We had a 18 hour stopover so decided to go on the Flyer, i recommend it as it is an experience you will not forget, we were there in the night, so to see the lights of Singapore was truly wonderful",,,
,,Awesome,5,,What a wonderful experience. We didn鈥檛 pre book tickets or whatsoever but there was no Q and we boarded easily. The view is amazing. We were there at sunset but I can imagine that with a clear blue sky it will be great too. The ride is very smoothly and you hardly notice you are moving. This is a must do when you are in town.,,,
,,fantastic flyers!!!,4,,super exciting and the lights and videos are really fantastic . thank God i get to visit singapore and experience the flyers...me n my husband were very impressed. we will end our short trip to sngapore here. i will definitely come back and bring friends both from Us and Philipines.,,,
,,Great vantage point for Singapore,5,,This was a lovely way to spend some time viewing Singapore....made even better by having a car all to ourselves. It wasn't nearly as busy as I thought it would be,,,
,,Wonderful Experience,5,,"You must take a ride on the Singapore Flyer, it鈥檚 a wonderful way to see the city from the skies! It鈥檚 easy to get there and a lot of the city tour buses also start from there.",,,
,,Best view of the Marina,5,,The Singapore Flyer was an air conditioned cabin that had great views of the marina area. It took roughly 1/2 hour to go the rotation. Plenty of seats facing both directions but all of the people in our cabin were wandering to catch different views of Singapore and there were a lot of selfies being taken.,,,
,,A techlogical marvel,5,,The flyer is fun and provides excellent views of the bay area. The ride takes around 30 mins and there is a small queue generally to board the capsule.,,,
,,Great Views,5,,"Excellent views of the city, and the wait wasn't long at all. A little pricey but we thought it was worth it!",,,
,,Amazing view of the city,5,,"Breathtaking view of the city from the height. The whole ride takes 30 mins and gives you enough time to enjoy it and take cool pics. It is quite convenient to reach. When we went there it was almost empty so no queues.

Its beat to visit this after sunset. Thats when you get the beat view. Juat like everything else in Singapore tickets are available online and best to book upfront to avoid any ticketing queues.",,,
,,Top attractions,5,,We thought it as a common attraction. But I gives u a memorable time for the life time . Must go for all who visit Singapore,,,
,,Definitely do this in Singapore,5,,"We visited the Monday after Grand Prix weekend which gave us the added bonus of seeing the track from above - fabulous. We were lucky to have blue clear skies and the views from this are fabulous. Very slick operation , we encountered no queues and small numbers in the gondolas which is always a bonus on these wheels if you're keen on taking photos. Yes we bought the photo too ! Thank you flyer for a great time",,,
,,Great views and experience,5,,"Went there this morning. No point trying to book as website keeps saying 0830 is the only available booking, so big mistake there. Was very quiet at 11 am. Is a tad expensive, but then again what isn鈥檛 here in Singapore. Great views, good commentary, wouldn鈥檛 do it in mariginal weather conditions,",,,
,,Amazing moment,5,,"Enjoined and stunning with a landscape and city view of Singapore, one of landmark that鈥檚 recommended don鈥檛 miss, food was great too.",,,
,,Very nice feeling,5,,"The flyers is just wonderful, it gives you a top view of Singapore and you can see it with 360 degree view. It was worth riding this.",,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,So exciting and amazing journey indeed. It can't be missed if you are visiting Singapore. The well organised and such a nice experience it is.,,,
,,View from the top,4,,Relaxing day out. Best to go in the evening as you can see the scenery change from light to dark in a matter of 30mins.,,,
,,Half of it is nice,3,,Nothing much to see. Inside is spacious and air con. Have seats for elderly to sit down. Half of it you can see the skyscrapers of Singapore the other half is basically nothing. U can go for it if u got a deal but not a must do in Singapore.,,,
,,Stunning views,4,,One of the best attractions of Singapore. Quite unique to see have these great views of whole Singapore. Kids loved it as well. Although it takes about 45 minutes to go round it鈥檚 not boring at all.,,,
,,Scenic Views of Singapore,4,,"This wheel is 165m which is 30m higher than the London Eye. Cost is $33 an adult equating roughly to 拢20. The wheel takes around half an hour to complete a revolution. You get great views of the marina bay area and beyond. You also get to see part of the F1 circuit if you're a F1 fan.
We visited in October. There were no queues.
Overall this was a good experience",,,
,,Asia鈥檚 largest observation wheel.,4,,"We arrived early to try and beat the crowds but there was already a queue. Got the tickets, through security screening and we were soon in the capsule accompanied by eleven shouting noisy Chinese tourists. We decided to stand for the 30 minute duration otherwise our vision would have been continually interrupted. Interesting ride with good views of nearby buildings and landmarks, the straits, and the many ships at anchor or heading to/from port. Unfortunately it was not a clear morning and thus limited the panoramic views from the 165m apex. S$33 per adult, not worth it on the day but we can cross it off our bucket list.",,,
,,Nothing Special,2,,"While starting the ride you will feel a bit excited, but once you are there, theres is nothing special except at the highest point, when you get to see the bay. There are too much of iron architecture blocking your view.",,,
,,Nice views from 165 meters heigth,5,,"We, a family of four, went there to get a view from above of Singapore and we were not disappointed. We also were quite lucky that we did not have to queue (just after noon) though I did here from other sources that there are sometimes quite long queues. If you bring your Singapore Airlines-Boardingpass you will get a 10% discount.",,,
,,View all Singapore,4,,"it is nice to see singapore from the top with nice flight. Also, There are many activities you can do at the flight. Cost Per Adult 33 S$ and Child 21 S$.",,,
,,Excellent views of the city,5,,Great views - felt that night visits better than day visits more so if you are already doing the cable car in the day time while visiting sentosa island. Pods are very spacious and views are excellent.,,,
,,Beautiful but very expensive tickets,4,,"Its definitely a one time experience, but I strongly believe that doing this during daytime makes more sense as one can see clear views of upto Malaysia coastline, of course subject to weather conditions. During night time its just views of the city lights and skyscrapers which is not something new to frequent travelers. However the ticket for just a 30 minute ride costed us approx. 160 S$ (4 adults and 2 kids) which I felt was not worth the value.",,,
,,Great views,5,,Great views of Singapore on the flyer. Pods are very spacious & not overcrowded. definitely recommend doing this,,,
,,Nice experience,4,,Good views around the city very well done without long queuing for us fortunately. We tried to catch the sundown but were unfortunately a half an hour to early...,,,
,,Relaxing Way to Get Great City Views,5,,"Pretty straight forward attraction, but a must do when in Singapore. It give great views of the city. It doesn鈥檛 move too fast, so you can enjoy the ride. Be sure to go in the morning before it gets too crowded. It opens at 8:30. We were there at 9am, and it was perfect. We had a capsule all to ourselves. Lighting is great at that time for photos, too.",,,
,,Visit the Flyer,5,,Incredible views of the city we picked the right time and had a pod of our own they usually have about a dozen in each pod during peak times. Can be delayed if lightning about and you can even have your wedding in one of the pods!!,,,
,,Spectacular views!,5,,"Having been on the London eye a few times, this was most impressive. Higher than the London eye and pods much bigger an$ more sophisticated with technology inside. The kids quite enjoyed the 鈥渨alk of facts鈥?before boarding the pod.",,,
,,"Quite an attraction, but too slow",3,,Too slow as it rotates at a slower pace than expected. Overall I felt there were more interesting things to do if one is in Singapore for 2-3 days,,,
,,Breathtaking,4,,"I honestly expected to be unimpressed with going up in a slow Ferris wheel. I was pleasantly surprised. You get a bird's eye of the entire city with the benefit of a pre recorded narrator pointing out notable landmarks.

It's a must do while while in Singapore.",,,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,AUD$33 Admission fee. Closest MRT is Promenade which is a 10 minute easy walk. Late afternoon visit so no crowds. On board commentary a bit monotonous during the 30 minute rotation.....probably on a continuous loop.,,,
,,We loved it,5,,Great view of the city. See if you can buy tickets in advance and make sure to be on time. Take some water with you :),,,
,,kids loved it,4,,"visited earlier this month and even that Singapore Flyer was not on my plan for the Singapore Trip, my kids got excited in seeing the giant wheel and asked to experience it. It ended up as a good decision as we all enjoyed getting some fascinating views from the 165m high Singapore Flyer.",,,
,,Excellent attraction-views as promised,5,,"We visited Singapore at a time of intermittent thunderstorms. When a sunny day materialized, we headed right for the Singapore Flyer and were not disappointed. This is basically a large, high-tech ferris wheel which offers air-conditioned compartments for views all over Singapore. We arrived rather early in the day so had our own compartment. We had views all over the city & nearby offshore islands. There was also a running commentary which was not intrusive at all in that it stopped at intervals so you could enjoy the views. Hope to return someday. We are advised that sunset is the best time to go.",,,
,,Third time,5,,We always time it to take in the sunset colours. Bird's eye view of downtown Singapore not to be missed. Everyone we've taken here for the ride loved it,,,
,,Great way to see the city,5,,Fantastic views over this gorgeous city. The staff are very helpful and the pods are clean get there early to avoid the queues.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer Expierence,5,,Fantastic. We went late at night and had a marvellous view of the Singapore Lights and sights also we had a great view of the Formula 1 race track.We have been on several of these rides but this one is a must do!,,,
,,360 degree view from the top.,4,,"look at singapore from a view at 165 metres (highest point).
Singapore Flyer is the height of a 42-storey building 鈥?that鈥檚 some 30 metres taller than the famed London Eye.
It鈥檚 the world鈥檚 largest observation wheel (outside United States).
Taking a flight on this S$240 million wheel is a one-of-a-kind experience you wouldn鈥檛 want to miss.
personally, I won't recommend for the dining option unless you
- can dine with your eyes looking out of the pod while stuffing the food into your mouth.
- disconnect with your loved ones onboard as you can't talk with food in your mouth and your eyes stick to the fantastic view from high up.
- about an hour of sitting in the pod (2 rotations) without a chance to go relief yourself while you are stuck in the pod.
- just go for dining nearby and focus on the birds eye view of the city.",,,
,,Bad signage to the attraction,3,,"Just a warning. This place is designed for people who go there by tour coaches.

For those going from the MRT, it's a so-near-yet-so-far experience because of the bad signage. It gets worse when it is a hot day and you have kids in tow and you just wonder if you are going the wrong way. The escalator at the side of car park that leads to the overhead bridge to the Singapore Flyer building has no signs so I won't be surprised if many people end up jaywalking instead. And even if you use the overhead bridge, you will reach level 2, and then you realise that you have to walk a big round to reach the escalator that goes to level 1.

There are no seating area at the taxi area, and also hardly any seats for anyone who wants to take a rest without buying a drink. There are also no seats when queuing, which adds on to the bad experience especially when the queue is long.",,,
,,"""Amazing Experience""",5,,Want to see Singapore from the top visit this . Although sometimes you feel it's slow but the view from the top make it worth. I would suggest to visit this place at night rather than in a day. Please carry a good motion capture camera.,,,
,,A wheel with a view,5,,The first thing you must see in Singapore. Gives you a bird's eye view of the city and really sets you up for the things ahead. Fantastic engineering achievement. A truly fun ride.,,,
,,What a experience,5,,It was a great experience with my girlfriend and it one of the best place I had visited in my Singapore trip,,,
,,Beautiful view,5,,When you go on this the view is amazing! Make sure you take your camera because you can get photos of alot of other attractons like Gardens By The Bay and The Marina Sands Hotel. Another must do in Singapore.,,,
,,Great view of the city,4,,Great view of the city from the Flyer - a little bit boring but glad we did it. It cost about 30 Singapore dollars which was pretty reasonable. Easy to walk to from Marina Bay.,,,
,,Awesome,5,,"I am scared of heights,but this is well worth doing,the view is amazing and i would recommend you do this at night the lights of the city is fantastic",,,
,,One of the tourist spot that you need to go when you visit Singapore,5,,"The Singapore flyer was exciting, the different angles of the skyline and the tourist spots in Singapore was mostly viewed when you do this. Lights and video presentation was also nice. I would suggest to do the video presentation before the ride so we can focus on the outside view rather than watching the video. Price paid should be for an hour or for 2 rotations. Would like to do this again when we visit Singapore.",,,
,,Nice view,3,,"Visited flyer while in Singapore. Decided to go evening to see lights over the city, unfortunately there was a lot of others with same idea. Really crowded, first queue to tickets and just at the counter they say that an additional hour for getting in the wheel! That is not really good service. Only one ticket counter. The tour itself quite nice thus getting in same car with ADHD Chinese disturbing the experience. If you visit there pre book your tickets and consider pay little extra to get private car",,,
,,A nice 25 min view of part of Singapore,3,,"As wheels go this one has a nice view over the Kallang river and the city centre of tall building and historical places. At night its clearly a very colourful array of lights and during the day often a good viewing point to see the city centre (financial centre) and what is left of Tanjong pagar container Harbour. Another key aspect here is your in the middle of the F1 race course, so you can see the boxes or Pits during the period other than the race. It takes just under 30 mins to do the round. The facilities are ok but other than the view not much here.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer at Night!,5,,"We visited on Sunday September 23rd 2018. We arrived around dusk, and it started to get dark when we were on board. The scenery of Singapore in the evening from the flyer was awesome! We took so many great pictures from the Flyer!",,,
,,Slow moving,3,,"It has fantastic views, but waiting in the queue to get on, and then the slow pace of the flier itself makes it seem you are using a big part of your day. Also fairly expensive, but wat in Singapore is not?",,,
,,Over-Rated. Over Charged. Nothing Impressive.,1,,"Over hyped marketing. Over-rated by locals. Over charged with nothing spectacular! In other words, BORING!",,,
,,Awesome night time flight,5,,"Having decided upon Singapore for our honeymoon and arriving at Singapore in the afternoon we were able to view the Flyer from our balcony of the Pan Pacific Hotel.
It become an obvious choice to ride the Singapore flyer late at night as the views of Marina Bay become bathed in an amazing array of colours.
Try to get onboard for the latter flight/rides of the day to fully appreciate the Marina Bay Area",,,
,,Lived up to the hype.,5,,"Breath taking views and a beautiful small journey. 20-25 mins it takes to complete one round and u will love the city even more when in the flyer. Absolutely mesmerising. Catch breath taking view of the city, Marina Bay sands , F1 track and many more.",,,
,,THE MOST EXCITING 30 MINUTES IN OUR LIFE,5,,"They said THE BALL IS ROUND. But for us Singapore Flyer is round. We went there last Saturday Oct 6, 2018 with my wife and son. We boarded the capsule around 630 in the evening, and to see the entire Singapore up above.

The capsule can accommodate 28 people but we were only 12 that time inside the capsule. That was our most exciting thirty minutes ride. Over the top, you can view Gardens by the Bay, The Marina Bay Sands and the buildings that lined up the Singapore Skyline. You cant barely noticed its moving when you are far away. But if you ride it you can notice its moving slowly.

Recommend this for all ages, you can bring your children riding and enjoy the scene above.",,,
,,Amazing ride,5,,"Singapore Flyer experience is very good , I was afraid of heights but it was amazing views all around Singapore from Flyer, visit is must for experience , it rotates at very slow rate and one circle completed in 40-45mts . Inside Flyer one can go for dining also .",,,
,,Amazing View but overpriced,3,,"You get an amazing view of the gardens by the bay/dome, the city and Marina Bay Sands. The cabin is big and equipped with with AC. The ride takes about 25mins to complete and moves very slowly. Ticket price was S$33 which I thought was a bit too much.",,,
,,Just like London EYE,5,,Just like London eye in a different perspective Not sure is worth recommending with the price range offered,,,
,,Only go in evening,5,,Best time to go on the flyer is at night. You get an amazing view of the gardens by the bay/dome. Singapore at night whilst on the flyer looks beautiful. The cabin/pod itself is big so you can move about it and take pictures from loads of angles. Must do whilst in Singapore.,,,
,,Great view and a lot larger than it's London counterpart,3,,"More space, not atrociously priced and great views of the city like most of the other eyes. Takes a lot longer for one revolution so plenty of time for photos. But would only recommend it if you are on a romantic trip or want to fascinate your kids by the engineering marvel that it is. Otherwise there are plenty of place to get great views of Singapore.",,,
,,What a view,5,,"We went on a quiet day so we only shared the giant cabin with 2 other people. The view is amazing & the ride so smooth. It goes for 30 mins, but it seems much quicker. Added bonus - the cars are air conditined!!!",,,
,,Fabulous views in air-conditioned comfort,5,,"This is an ideal way to get a different perspective of Singapore on a Ferris wheel bigger than the London Eye. The ride is slow and very smooth, provides excellent views of the city sights and busy harbour, and there鈥檚 plenty of time to take everything in using the helpful in-capsule video and iPads. It鈥檚 easy to get to on foot from the Gardens on the Bay (use the unusual double-helix bridge) and I was able to get back to my hotel (Jen Tanglin) using the no 75 bus that stops outside. There are refreshment outlets by the entrance and a lovely ice-cream stall by the nearby Greek Theatre.",,,
,,Holiday,5,,Singapore the top city on tourism Garden day and night are attractive Zoo amazing all tyre of birds You must have WiFi and taxi applications To request taxi like Uber !! Because when you go out from the zoo very difficult to fine taxi !,,,
,,It was ok,4,,"this was a really fun experience,but i was afraid of heights, it helped me got over it though, this is or is not advisable for people who are afraid of heights",,,
,,Fly Singapore,4,,"Once you've arrived in Singapore there are flights to be had at every turn. There's you're bus Captain and every ride you have at Universal Studio's is a flight. The Singapore Flyer is another example. It takes 30"" for a full flight rotation. I've done this during the sunset/evening & full daylight. Both had a unique feel. Every booking can be done online now and you generally save 5% or better but with some conditions.",,,
,,Just Loved the view,5,,"This is a visit to Singapore must - the cost sing$30 was okay for a mere male but not sure if there were group concessions say for a family? Great views in air conditioned comfort of the sea, Marina Bay Sands & Gardens as well as the heart of Singapore. Great experience.",,,
,,SO GOOD,5,,We have done the London Eye but this one is so much better. The pods are very large and it goes so slowly you can take your time with the photos from every angle. This is a must for anyone.,,,
,,F1 Circuit Overview,3,,The flyer was a great way to get a view of the Marina Bay Street circuit from above. We went during the day and the evening to take great photos of SIN GAP ORE,,,
,,"Not so crowded, because it's slow and boring.",3,,"Maybe Ferris wheels aren't my thing, but standing around a slow-moving capsule as you see the same sights as a rooftop bar isn't my thing. Pick a rooftop bar instead. Also, due to the glass design, females should avoid wearing short skirts unless they wish to show off.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"We were able to go on this using our Singapore Airlines stopover package pass. There was a bit of a wait, however the views from the Singapore Flyer were awesome. Loads of great photos to be taken.",,,
,,Views for Miles,5,,"This was a fun way to get a great view of Downtown, the Bay, the Gardens, and most of the city. It's nice, relaxing ride. Very comfortable with some great information along the ride. I would recommend doing this first to get some info and ideas for the rest of your site seeing trip.",,,
,,Good view of city,3,,"If you have visited similar places in other countries you cn give it a skip. Its overall 30 40 min ride. You grt good view of bay and merlion and the city but its slow and you tend to get bored. Also the temp control is not low so it does become a little,warm. With 33Sgd ...it is fairly expensive. If first timer pls do take else skip",,,
,,So-so,3,,"The place is well maintain. Exciting, but only for the 1st 10min.. after that, boring.. to long.....",,,
,,Great views,5,,This huge wheel is comparable to the London eye although what you see is obviously very different. The views of the city and surrounds could only be matched by a scenic helicopter flight at much greater expense,,,
,,Still an eye opener,3,,"This was our third time visiting and I must say it was still an opener. We went in the late afternoon and the crowd was ok. Not a long q to go up and inside the cabin was also comfortable number of people.
I would say the experience on the flyer itself is still wonderful and enjoyable.

But the food court was getting from bad to worse. It used to be filled with many people and all shops were opened. But now less than half the shop are operating and barely any people there. I am not sure how to describe it but the surrounding shops and restaurants just doesn鈥檛 have the mixed vibe to suit the flyer.
There is koi pond directly under the flyer where you can purchase fish food to feed the koi.",,,
,,Excellent,5,,"What a view! Air condition capsules are clean and cool. Amazing views all over the city. Next time will go at night, lights would be spectacular",,,
,,Highlight of our visit,5,,"Even though I am not a fan of heights the flight in the Singapore Flyer was a real treat. The ability to see all main sights from the perfect vantage point is not to be missed if you are visiting this wonderful country.
No queues, reasonable cost, great staff and as with everything here, spotlessly clean.",,,
,,better view in day,3,,i think better to the the ride in the day than night because you can see much more & further during the day.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Singapore flyer gives you a spectacular view of the city. However charges are little high but worth a visit.,,,
,,Truly Outstanding,5,,"Very similar to London Eye, it is one of the three top attractions in Singapore. What a fabulous view from the top. It takes 30 min to complete one round. It is must visit for all Singapore tourists. Only teh price is a bit costlier.",,,
,,Best night view,5,,"We went there in the evening when the sun is about to set. When we were up on the flyer, all the lights from the high rise starts coming on. Its beautiful. Highly recommended!",,,
,,Relaxing way to view Singapore,4,,Gentle rise to the top of the flyer. Went with my daughter and she had a blast. Great way to see the views from high up.,,,
,,Great view,4,,"Well it鈥檚 a bit wheel that takes 1/2 an hour to do a rotation,great views with points of reference inside the cabin to look at. Try to get a cabin by yourself as we shared one with another family that were rather loud and argumentative amongst each other.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer Ride,4,,"Thirty minutes is enough time to get a glimpse of the entire city skyline and then some. Not really for those with a fear of heights, but is a great way to overcome it, since the cabins move very gradually. Gives great pictures at night because of the colours.",,,
,,amazing views,4,,"went up during the day on the flyer, amazing views of Singapore ,went round at right speed allowing time to take photos, took about 30 mins to do full circle, would be good at night to see the sky line lit up but we didn't have time",,,
,,An engineering marvel on the sea shore,5,,"A wonderful piece of engineering where they have built this machinery on the sea shore which gives a wonderful view. On one side is the Singapore city business towers, on other side is Marina bay sands, Sea and long winding roads. The movement is slow so you would catch every colorful thing around the flyer. Below is a wonderful water theme with a waterfall that flows across and small pond with Koi fish that you could feed and many more entertainment activities. A must place to go.",,,
,,Very nice experience,5,,"Visited Singapore in last week of September with my senior citizen mom. Me and my mom enjoyed our visit to flyer. It is very slow so suitable for all age groups. Views of Singapore is superb from top.
Each capsules have seating arrangements so one who can鈥檛 stand for long time can seat and enjoy.
One thing which was surprising for me was that it never stops...We have to enter or exit from the capsules in running state only. But don鈥檛 worry its very slow so you can manage
Overall
Worth visiting",,,
,,Great view at Singapore flyer,5,,"Great experience at Singapore flyer, very smooth ride, systematic, cool in scorching heat and what a view from the place, I will highly recommend it for the visitors.",,,
,,Vacation,5,,"Good view , worth going once .little expensive though . It takes half an hour to complete the round . You get a good view of the city from the top.",,,
,,"Pricey, but providing great views",4,,"Easiest to reach from the Promenade MRT station, this is almost identical to London Eye. On the other side of the bridge you can also visit the Marina Bay Sands Skypark observation deck, which is a bit cheaper (Infinity Pool is only for hotel guests).",,,
,,Nice City View,5,,"Worth to try if you want to see Singapore City from Top. But if you want to get nice selfie photo, better you ride on afternoon, at night you will see nice city light but not good for taking photos since too dark inside. One ride around 30 minutes!",,,
,,Do not miss!,4,,"We booked the Singapore Sling plus ride which was lovely, waited in the VIP lounge and was escorted up to our ""pod"". Only three of us for the ride which was lovely. So much information and it really is a great thing to do when you first arrive in Singapore to get your bearings and decide what you want to do during your stay. We picked the 6.30 so we got tho see daylight and dark.",,,
,,Great view of the F1 track,5,,Booked this for a birds eye view of the track before watching the GP! Smooth operation and outstanding views of Singapore! We timed it for early morning and had the pod to ourselves! My wife is not keen on heights and only looked out on the way down! Well worth doing for great photo opportunity of the city early in the morning when the sky is clearer!,,,
,,Great views but a bit expensive for what it is,3,,"Obviously the views are amazing the ride lasts for 1/2 hr but $80 for 2 adults and a 4 yr old, it鈥檚 a bit steep. At least our 1 yr old was free.",,,
,,Fantastic views of Singapore,5,,"The Singapore flyer is one of the biggest observation wheels in the world. Brilliant views of Singapore and on a clear day you can see to Malaysia and Indonesia. We arrived at 9.15am and there was no queue to purchase tickets ($33 SGD) and we had a capsule to ourselves. The full rotation takes about 32 mins. The capsule is fully air conditioned. There are shops and eateries there also, however, we didn鈥檛 stay as our next adventure awaited. I am going back for a gelato from the gelatissimo later on. Take the MTR to promenade station and take exited A and then follow the signs to Singapore Flyer. About a 5 minute walk. Highly recommend this attraction.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Our ticket was included in our Grand Prix ticket, but still worth paying to go on. , fabulous views and time to see",,,
,,Great experience,5,,Did this tonight. Was well organised and worth the money. Queues looked long but moved quickly. Would recommend.,,,
,,Great view but go at night,4,,"I would recommend going to this, but do it at night and see the light show from the Marina Bay Sands.

There was lots of room to move and take photos. The pod was clean and the staff helpful, which made it better it was free as we brought tickets for the F1.",,,
,,Second time,5,,As I said second time up the flyer and well worth it again. The views are amazing by day and maybe next time I will go at night. Reasonably priced at about $33 singapore and the gift shop is good too and not too expensive. Suitable for everyone and those who don't like heights it's very safe and the cabins are roomy and you can walk around. Overall great and I recomend.,,,
,,Nice location to see the singapore,5,,From top we can see all over Singapore. It is good to see the entire Singapore from this location. Overall it was nice Experience,,,
,,Great views,5,,"We visited on a quiet day and were lucky to be in a pod on our own, so had lots of room to move around and take photos. Fantastic views over downtown. We realised we were right by the f1 pitlanes so had a walk down there after.",,,
,,Nice ride,4,,"In Singapore it is recommended you try the big wheel at least once. Although it is not as fantastic as the London Eye, you still get to see a lot and that one experience is worth the price.",,,
,,Great View,4,,Thoroughly recommend a ride on the Singapore Flyer fabulous views of Singapore and the surrounding areas. The pods are comfortable and air conditioned and the viewing is amazing. Travelling so slowly you get plenty of time to take in the views and get some brilliant photographs.,,,
,,Worth a trip,5,,We have been on wheels like this in Vegas and London and this one is equally as good. Great views across Singapore. We went at night to see everything lit up and it was great. Expensive but pretty cool.,,,
,,Ehat a relaxing way to see the city,4,,I had a lovely relaxed adventurous approximately 42 storeys high looking ar the gorgeous city of Singapore . I took a S$33 flight on the Singapore Flyer and was able to get some breathtaking photos of the city as well as learn about the spots of internet from the robot announcer. Normally I am a little weary on bit you could barely feel this one move. The pod I was in could hold up to 26 people! The pod had air conditioning and very long benches to sit on and to enjoy the view.,,,
,,Nice view but experience was too short,3,,There are fantastic views to be had but the experience felt a bit short for the cost of the admission ticket.,,,
,,Amazing view of the City..well that's it...,4,,"The flyer is huge and is easily spotted from almost anywhere in the main town. You can have a good aerial view of the town. The ride is almost 45 minutes and the waiting time depends on the crowd and can range from 20 mins to 2 hours. Its a new experience to ride such giant wheels, the way you alight a moving cabin. However, not sure whether it is all worth it for the money, time you spend for the aerial view !!!. Alternatively, just go to the roof top of any high rise building and you can get a similar view from there as well..Try it once if you have never been in a flyer in your life...! Choose a lesser crowded day/time so you do not end waiting for your turn..",,,
,,Great perk included in your grand prix ticket,5,,"In my previous 3 trips to Singapore I had always ran out of time to go on the flyer. This trip I made sure I took to time to take a ride. One perk of purchasing the grand prix ticket was free access after 230pm...and it was fantastic. I am unsure of how busy the attraction is when there is no GP on, but I waited only 5 minutes to get on. After a very hot day walking around Singapore and sitting in the baking sun, take 45 minutes out of your visit and enjoy an air conditioned moving cityscape.",,,
,,MESMERIZING EYE FOR SINGAPORE,4,,Great place !! Affordable !! one of the finest view of the country !! pay small feel at large !!please carry camera !!! sport shoes !! please visit souvenir shop !! 40 mins ride !! last ride 9:15 please be there before hour !!,,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"Maybe we did something wrong, but it was very awkward to get to. We're not as steady on our feet as we once were, so actively look for the disbaled signs as it usually means lifts , ramps etc. But it still involved a lot of walking.",,,
,,Relaxing views of the city,5,,Your barely feel you are moving on this relaxing way to see the sights of Singapore. I was pleasantly surprised by the large size of the pods and the small amount of people in each one. As such there was plenty of room to sit or stand or walk around to view the different areas.,,,
,,Worth a visit,4,,"I have been to Singapore many times before on business when I was still working. Never had the luxury to sneak out and get a ride on the Singapore Flyer. Finally made up my mind to take a ride with my wife. The capsule was large with some benches for rest in the middle so we shared with a couple of other tourists and we were free to walk around during the ride. It was a short but great ride as you got to see the Marina Bay, its hotels and casinoes, the beautiful Gardens by the Bay, down town core and the city blocks around us high up from the air. Was a great experience but unfortunately the day we rode was cloudy and grey out there. It must be fantastic if either the sky is clear in the daytime or night falls when neon lights are on. For me, once is probably enough anyways. There was one capsule all set up for a meal with dining table, silver and glass wares and I was told somebody have booked it for a romantic dinner.",,,
,,Nice way to see the sights,4,,"There was no line up when we went, and the total attraction took around 45 minutes including getting tickets, boarding, and riding the attraction. A nice way to experience an a/c view of the bay and surrounding sights.",,,
,,Mesmerizing views over the Singapore river,5,,"It was a great experience to have a ride in Singapore flyer. The views are amazing. Highly recommended to do it at night time. You can get a birds eye view of Singapore river, marina bay sands, Merlion, garden by the bay and many more other attractions. It takes about half an hour to do a full spin and the time and money you spend is totally worth as per my experience.",,,
,,Not recommended to go at night,3,,"It felt like a romantic activity, high altitude, weekday night, less people. But the surrounding area around the flyer was not at all illuminated, save for the pinpricks of light from the nearby port. There was literally nothing to see unless you have night vision goggles.",,,
,,Amazing views at dusk with the city lights,5,,Really enjoyed this as its air conditioned which is a must in singaore. The views are fantastic and you can get great photos of the marina bay area. We also did the skypark on the same day and for the same price felt it was a waste of time. The spin rotation is slow enough that you have enough time to check out the 360 degree views and take heaps of photos.,,,
,,excellent,5,,very good place to have a great view on singapore its also very close to marina bay so best spot in singapore to visit,,,
,,Wheal with a View,5,,"The gondolas are extremely roomy, gave a feeling of being at the top of the world. The safety seems to be excellent.",,,
,,Worth it,4,,"We paid extra for a Singapore sling experience which probably ensured we only shared the capsule with 2 other people. The cocktail wasn鈥檛 up to much, but the views were stunning.
A must do to see he Singapore skyline, but make sure you wait until darkness falls.",,,
,,Magnificent View of Singapore Skyline !!!,5,,"You can tell the city name just by seeing their skyline !! and when you see that skyline from a specific place which clearly shows it's all together a great experience.

It's a 20 minutes slowly moving giant wheel ride which you can enjoy with kids , family and friends .

you can enjoy an audio which is getting played inside and giving some information about the places you are seeing at that moment.

Suggestion for tourist : you can skip sky deck visit (top of MBS hotel) if you are doing flyer as both places serves the purpose of seeing Singapore Skyline :)

An important point when you go to buy ticket they have some discounts for PR and EP pass holders even if you are buying tickets for any visitor.",,,
,,Worth it,5,,It's a little expensive but offers a great view of the city. I would recommend going at night. The other tourists are what ruined the experience for me.,,,
,,Wonderful,5,,What fantastic views from up on the flyer. It constantly moves very slowly so there is plenty of time to get photos in every direction. We went just as the sun was going down and got lovely photos of the lights coming on and the sunset.,,,
,,nice views. the observatory deck on Marina Bay Sands is better for photo's,5,,"nice to do. not for taking good pictures, but the views are spectacular. Service is fine. Close to the entrance on ground floor you will find a small foodcourd with good food and low prices.",,,
,,Great way to the city,5,,No queue when I visited which was awesome. Pods are air-conditioned and go around at just the right speed. There's a map you can click on for more info. Great views of the city and harbour.,,,
,,Amaizing,5,,Excellent an experience just love it. You have time to watch beautiful Singapore and enjoy spectacular views and scenery. The best way to see Singapore at night,,,
,,Try the dining option when available,4,,We had the great opportunity to visit the Flyer on NYE when they had carts specced out for dinning and it was awesome! To watch the entire orchestra come together and how well planned it was. Execution could've been better but then I'd be nit picking. Overall the Flyer experience was a great one. What a way to see the Singapore skyline especially when the sun sets. All the lights and traffic bustling around. It truly was beautiful.,,,
,,Worth doing,4,,"We just turned up, around 13.30hrs no que and got on straight way.
By the time we left the site there were large groups of pre arranged /bus trips.
Could be just our good luck, but suggested lunchtime would be a good idea?
Worth doing these types of wheel /flyers are aways good to do the birds eye view.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Well worth a ride on this, we went during the recent F1 meeting when entry was free with our ticket. By day the views are great but at night it adds a whole new dimension, so worth doing both.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"View is great up here, ride is nice and smooth. Buy tiket before hand is better to avoid queu at tiket counter.",,,
,,Enjoyed the experience,5,,Great experience to see the views particularly the f1 track. We had this opportunity as part of our f1 tickets so not sure what the cost would be dong this independently,,,
,,Good see,4,,My fairest time to be inside the cabin like that I am happy and my baby so happy. I will visit next time with all of my family,,,
,,Great view,5,,Exelent view and slow enough to check out the whole panorama the price was right the staff were good the pod was nice and clean all good,,,
,,A great view of Singapore,4,,"Difficult to rate this one, but my wife and I enjoyed our time once we got to the Flyer. What we found was that there was no signposting at all from public transport. The expectation seemed to be that you arrive either by tour bus or car.
There is very little else around the Flyer and it seems to be stuck out a bit on its own. So don鈥檛 expect to have lots of choice for food and drinks once you get there. Cost for two adults was $S66. When we arrived we initially queued with two bus tours until we were brought forward in the queue. ( Something to watch out for) once we got sorted the queue went quite quickly, about 20 minutes. The 鈥榝light鈥?takes 30 minutes in air conditioned cabins. There are seats but everyone stood up and moved around to take pictures. Plenty of space. There are 4 small iPad type screens to give a bit of information on what you are seeing. I would have to say that the views are good and in my opinion if you spend a lot on getting to Singapore and staying in Singapore why wouldn鈥檛 you do this? Yes you might get a bit of reflection from the glass, yes it might cloud over a bit, but the experience and memory was good. I would rather spend $S66 on this than an average meal.",,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,Amazing experience. You will be able to view almost the entire Singapore. Plenty of eateries located below the flyers. Food is great however price slightly higher than normal hawker. Mainly due to its location as well as higher rental.,,,
,,Great Views,5,,"Good price, they gave us a private capsule since there were very few on line. Really enjoyed this activity. Highly recommended!!",,,
,,Round of Trip,5,,Was Mesmerising taking the singapore flyer and it was a memorable one... hope there is some kind of a stop right at the top for the cabin like a 2 min stop just to enjoy the view,,,
,,Singapore Grand Prix,5,,We had access to the Singapore Flyer with our Grand Prix tickets as we were in the correct zone. Much to our surprise we did not have to queue for long. The views from the flyer are spectacular. Definitely a must do.,,,
,,"Ok, but a bit expensive for the experience.",3,,"Singapore Flyer. MRT great way to get there. A bit pricey, 11 yr old interested for first ten minutes, then got bored. Could have been better with some info screens etc, so that you know what landmarks you are looking at or for. Scared of heights? This one was ok and the wheel does not move too quickly so no motion sickness.",,,
,,SingaporeGP,5,,Great night and views were fantastic. Time went so quick you do not realise you are up there for that long. Would you definitely take friends and family to this as a must do,,,
,,Nice Ride,5,,"A one hour ride with great views of the City, a evening or night ride is the better option if you can.",,,
,,Nice place to walk,4,,Very clean and beautiful place to spend your free time It鈥檚 in the center between the high rise buildings Sea water canal with many activities arround,,,
,,Enjoyable view,4,,"We visited this attraction at night and there was plenty of time on the Singapore Flyer to take lots of photos and videos of the surroundings.

Ultimately, this is just a big wheel, like many others around the world. The views make this worth the journey although it could be argued that you can get similar or better views on the Skyway at the Gardens by the Bay which I would choose over the Flyer if money was tight.

When we visited in the evening, we were also very hungry but aside from a few expensive restaurants, there was a Subway (where our children ate) and a small hawker where my wife and I ate but did not enjoy the food. Unfortunately, this was our first night in Singapore and we were a little disappointed with the food options available close to the Flyer, however, I would recommend visiting it as it's an enjoyable experience.",,,
,,slow paced,3,,"if you want to rest after a long walk around orchard and Marina Bay, this is the place to chill and have a view of Singapore. It is best to ride at night where it is cool after your dinner at the local hawker right below the Flyer.",,,
,,Nice night view,5,,"I visited here during Formula One weekend, and enjoyed . It spends 30 minutes for a cycle. A cargo can be capable for about 20 people. I enjoyed nice top of view of Marina area like Marina Bay Sands, Garden by the Bay and of course Singapore GP circuit course.",,,
,,"Amazing engineering, good views",4,,"Went up here during @f1nightrace the Singapore F1 Grand Prix. Was thankful it was included in the ticket price of our seats, as it was good, but not an overwhelming 鈥済reat鈥?experience.
Amazing engineering, and good view of the car race track, but Marina Bay Sky Park offers far superior views.",,,
,,A must visit whilst in Singapore,5,,"Fantastic views from this slowly rotating Singapore feature. Takes approx 30 mins but superb views from air conditioned pods, which have seats, but you can walk around in. Don't miss this one. MRT Promenade. Go at meal times to avoid the tour busses.",,,
,,Fascinating City Layout!,5,,"Our adventure started with the Singapore Flyer and I recommend you start there also! This is not your grandfathers Ferris wheel,the engineering is a work of art in itself, the view of the harbor, spectacular, well worth the fee.",,,
,,Half an hour well spent.,5,,"I prebooked my ticket online & found this a very easy process.
Turned up on the day, handed the ticket in & off I went!
The view is amazing & the information supplied was quite good.
Probably should have done on my first day to get the lay of the land!!!",,,
,,Worse view in Singapore! Better options. Don't waste your time.,1,,"I love photography and skylines. Only came here because of all the hype but wish we had not bothered. Not worth it. Goes really slow and the views are not that great. Plus, if you take photographs you get glass reflections in everything! My advice is go to a rooftop bar or restaurant or a cruise which is stunning. You can get clear views. The only advantage of the flyer is you get a birds eye view and rotate but I still would not recommend. This is not worth the money or hype. It was not very busy anyway which probably indicates why.",,,
,,"Impressive, but could be better",4,,"Impressive view (especially at night), comfortable air-conditioned cabins, enough time to see everything. The only issue is the illumination of the wheel itself - it's excessive and those lights reflect everywhere in the cabin distracting from the view and making it harder to shoot nice photos.",,,
,,What a ride,5,,"Really nice activity to do as you get to see the whole town from above....it doesn't go fast and that what makes it more enjoyable....been on it more that one time to photograph the city during the day, sunset and night and I am feeling you the truth here this city looks so different at night. You can also book for dinner but not sure how much it costs...",,,
,,"F1 day from the Singapore Flyer, amazing",5,,"You can not miss this attraction when visiting the city but if that weekend you have the Singapore F1 event, don鈥檛 lose the opportunity!",,,
,,Amazing view,5,,My ride was at 6:45pm. To me it was perfect. I was still able to see the view of the town during the sunset. Other people might prefers when it was darker to see the lights from the city. I was the only one on the cabin. The views were amazing. You could see both sides; Marina bay sand and business district. Highly recommended!,,,
,,Stunning Bay Area views night and day - a must!,4,,"I opted to visit at night just before the GP weekend kicked off on Friday. I was surprised how quiet it was and thought it had closed when I got my ticket at about 8pm but it was very much open. Much like the London Eye but bigger capsules to me. I did find it odd that the commentary was only in English even though I hear so much Mandarin around but the video screens have language options.

The views get better as you slowly move on up of course and the Bay Area stuns in all directions. The complete trip takes 30 minutes and felt long enough and fair for the entry fee. It was cool to zoom down with my camera to the pit lane and see Sky F1 team interview Force India drivers and I also saw Kimi from here too. The whole pit straight all lit up looked wonderful from here. In the the other directions you get perfect views of the Botanical gardens and the domes plus of course the Marina Bay hotel and the business district. Downside for photographs is of course the reflections and the dirty glass. I took so many pictures and might have a handful that are ok. I am guessing it is better for pictures during the day. But the capsule I was in needed a clean from outside. At the end there is an Nice sized gift shop and you are offered a picture when you first arrive and can buy it here if you want it.",,,
,,Cool experience,5,,Lovely views of Singapore from the top. It can be a photographers paradise as the unobstructed views can make a person take unlimited photos of Singapore,,,
,,Superb place for all ages,5,,I visit this in end of august with my family small kid 3 yrs and everyone enjoyed the city view it takes around 20 mins for one revolutions so everyone can sit.,,,
,,Pick and choose,3,,"If you are going on the observation deck of the Marina Sands Hotel then I dont think you need to do the flyer, However if you do the flyer it is a lovely 30 minute spin around with views of everything and a lovely opportunity to see the city at a height. They don't over crowd the capsule and there are no huge ques. Best time to go is Sunset",,,
,,A great view,5,,"Great view, I went during the day tie and was very happy with the view, i bet at night its also amazing. You can also book to have dinner on it. 1 rotation takes about 30 mins",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,3,,"If you visit Singapore you can not get on the Singapore Flyer and enjoy the suggestive skyline of the city.
The wheel is very high (about 160m), second only to the Marina Bay hotel, the tour lasts about forty minutes and the cabins are very spacious and give the possibility to have a fantastic view over the city and in particular on the marina bay gardens, another attraction not to be missed.
The cost is not really cheap.",,,
,,Flyer with a 360 degree view,4,,Singapore flyer was the best experience ever for watching the Singapore city from a bird eye view... book tickets online to avoid rush and save time.. it gives u a complete 360 degree view of the city and we did the tour in the evening as it鈥檚 best time to look above the city with melting sun.. it鈥檚 a 30-40 minuets ride in total and gondola has 28 capsules and accommodates 7-8 people in one capsule to give u better breathing space and view.. capsules are fully air conditioned and has a seating arrangement too.. gondola rotates very slowly and gives u a better view of entire city.. a must do thing when in Singapore.. we did this particularly as to get the feel of it.. this flyer is near to gardens by the bay and can be done walking too.. it takes 15-20 minuets by walking from gardens by the bay ..,,,
,,just sit look around,4,,we ride by singapore exploer pass. you can see what singgapore's skyline recommend visit after dinner,,,
,,Avoidable,1,,It is a very slow revolving cabin for city view. The waiting time was over 60 min. Not worth the money.,,,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,The Singapore flyer is a must do. Reasonably priced and a great way to see the city. Highly recommend even if you don鈥檛 like heights!,,,
,,Excellent for Panoramic Singapore view,5,,"Panoramic view lovers must visit this attraction of Singapore, I would recommend to select time in the evening that will ensure both view such as day light and night view, Overall an excellent experience,",,,
,,do not miss this!!,5,,"having been to the london eye, melbourne flyer etc, we were pleasantly surprised that the singapore flyer is even more amazing. the view from the flyer is just magical. you can see Malaysia and Indonesia on top of the numerous high rise building of the Singapore heartland, the business area and the many many attractions from this flyer. a must-do attraction.",,,
,,Good experience,5,,Really enjoyed .watching best of singapore in night from flyer was an experience of life time . Very long waiting time but it was worth after you step inside this. A little bit expensive ..,,,
,,Champagne Flight,5,,"The Singapore Flyer, is similar to the London Eye, but slightly larger. Located in the Marina Bay region, above the F1 pit complex it is a stop on most of the hop-on-hop-off bus routes.

We didn鈥檛 make it a priority on our previous trip to Singapore but this time I made sure that we did it. We pre booked a Champagne Flight, giving us a glass of Moet and chocolates, in a specially fitted out car. We happened to share it with 2 others but I guess depending on the time & day, there could be more or you could have it to yourself. We had one rotation, which takes 30 minutes. There is also a dining option with a table & chairs set-up in one of the other cars. This does 2 rotations.

I booked our flight so that we would see the sun set, getting the best of daylight views and night views.

Singapore is stunning and the harbour is one of the words busiest for trans-shipments so there is always something to see. If you are going to the F1 Grand Prix this week, I strongly suggest that you book, even for a 鈥榥ormal鈥?flight.",,,
,,A Revolving Experience,5,,"The Flyer is a must-see. We went there at night to fully savour the night time view with marina bay fully lit. The prices are reasonable for such an attraction and no long queuing was needed.

We went up to the platform and entered the cabin - togehter with a hord of mainland chinese and their free-ranging kids. These people turned out to be souring the experience due to their incredible and excessive noise levels and their fully uncontrolled, respectless and hyperactive kids.

However, the movement of the wheel is slow and one has time to see who the views are developing.

While Keppel Harbour with this great number of ship is impressive - more than Singapores East Coast - the real views are Marina Bay and beyond.

Standing out were the Gardens on the Bay, The Marina Bay Sands and the Durian. The overall experience at night was great - many good photos opportunities.

We will come back - not at daytime though, again at night time.

The Flyer's podium is quite underwhelming and better design and more points of interest could have been added.

Formula One's Singapore Race due in two weeks one could see from here the preparations and parts of the track going on. Must be nice to revolve around here, dining and wining in the cabins - then with TV - and watching the race.....",,,
,,Great Value Fantastic Views,5,,Get there early to avoid the queue and the bus tours. We did and it was a chilled out experience. Fortunate to share a capsule with a great family from India which added to the flight. The view as you go round is great. Couldn鈥檛 believe the sheer numbers of ships tied up of the coast and looking down on the F1 grid was so cool. At less than 拢20 I鈥檇 consider it good value for money.,,,
,,A wonderful ride,5,,A great way to see Singapore from a different angle. We went at night. No queues. A relaxing ride. Had a pod to ourselves.,,,
,,Top View of City,5,,Nice experience. Able to see the whole city from the top. Got a nice view of the F1 racing track which is just beside the flyer. Visited in August so it was too hot. But got discount in the ticket price because of Singapore birth month matches with my husband's birth month.,,,
,,Amazing views.,5,,A must visit when in singapore..cheap entry fees and beautiful views when you reach top point..great half an hour ride.,,,
,,Must do while in Singapore!,5,,"Amongst all other tourist attractions, in my opinion the flyer was one thing were you are 1 person of 8 in the cabin. We went before lunchtime, almost nobody around, no queue and not even the cabin was full on this Sunday.

The view was very interesting with a completely different angle on Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the bay.",,,
,,Unsure about going...... Do it,5,,"I can't count the number of times I thought I must go on this.
Well I finally did.

Seeing Singapore from this angle was an unexpected pleasure.

Extremely efficient

I arrived at the same time as a large tour group
Oh dear I thought, this will be interesting and will take a while, but no ushered into a fast lane to keep the tour together and others in smaller groups will have a great experience.

Cabins cleaned between each group exiting in true Singapore style.

Beautiful Koi pond to view as the rotation commences until you move up and out of the building

It was a stormy day but viewing was still possible. Little additional movement because of this

If you are troubled by heights don't fear, there is a bench to sit on in the middle and just look to the horizon.

Great interactive screen that helps navigate to scene below.
Enjoy the view. I can only imagine how this looks at night.",,,
,,Yes a great experience,5,,"Yes, finest experience in Singapore.. though you might want to skip this if you have problems with height.",,,
,,Splendid view!,5,,Better to come at night to see the awesome view of Singapore. I've been here many times and never had a bad experience on their service. It's one of the tourist spot and definitely must do in Singapore.,,,
,,Great views!,5,,"I was travelling on my own so didn't really want to be in a pod with a big group so I kept holding back in the queue, eventually I found a space and asked if I could go on my own, the staff were great and said of course. What an experience, loved it! The views were amazing, would definitely recommend doing this.",,,
,,This is a relatively new attraction and provides excellent overview on the city,4,,"The Flyer per cabins offers space for up to 20 people, but is currently not fully booked. Therefore you have mich space and can wider around in the laomist transparent cabin.The cabin moves very slowly and you can see the city to all sides. On the top you get a fantastic view also the the most stunning hotel of the city, the Marina bay Sands Hotel. you have also a great voew to the skyline . I tis not cheap but still very much worth going for it. One full turn takes about 30 minutes.",,,
,,Spectacular view from the top,5,,I visited the Singapore flyer during my recent visit .it was nice & beautiful view from the top.ticket price was reasonable ok but good if the child ticket prices reduce.the ticketing processes & the access to the flyer was quite ok.,,,
,,View from the top,5,,"The Singapore Flyer (Big Wheel) takes you on a 30 minute ride high above the city. The 'pods' are spacious and provide clear views of the surrounding area. You can see many of the major attractions in the city, including the F1 racetrack (preparations were well underway during our visit for the September event), the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands Hotel and environs, CBD and Esplanade. There is also an ongoing tv commentary to provide you with background information of the different areas in the city you may be observing.
This is well worth a visit during your trip to Singapore.

,,round and round,4,,I would say Mary-go-round of Singapore. See the whole of Singapore from this flyer. I would suggest you to visit this in night after gardens by the bay as both are near to each other. See the beauty of Singapore.,,,
,,F1 2017,5,,"If you are thinking of taking this trip to see the view of Singapore, I would suggest the evening as very beautiful. I was lucky to do on the evening of F1 and very surprised as no waiting. The views were amazing and seeing F1 at night breath taking.",,,
,,Great experience,5,,This gave us an aerial view of Singapore in about 35 minutes. The commentary was informative. We had a nice experience.,,,
,,Great experience,4,,"For someone who is afraid of heights this was an amazing experience. The wheel moved very slowly, the commentary was excellent and the view was just amazing. They even told you when you had reached the top. The pods were clean, there were seats to sit on or you could move around. Great photography opportunities and fantastic views of the Harbour. An experience not to be missed.",,,
,,Very Very Good experience,5,,"We tried it by mistake but did not regret, my entire family was very happy. It's kind of unique and not so much fearful. Speed is very slow. My mom & son both were comfortable.",,,
,,In the rain up high,5,,"Good service, easy to get around the attraction, price is not bad for what you get, We were just unlucky with the heavy rain when we right at the top.",,,
,,A 鈥榦ne-of-a-kind鈥?experience!!,4,,"This 鈥榤ust-do鈥?attraction, the 鈥淪ingapore Flyer鈥?was visited by our group of eight on the second day of our landing in Singapore. It is a giant Ferris wheel, where one can get 360掳 views of the city and on a clear day, they say, see as far as Malaysia and Indonesia! It is located in Marina Bay and is the largest observation wheel in Asia. The wheel's highest point is 165 metres (541 ft.) above the ground. There are 28 air-conditioned capsules, which take approximately 32 minutes to make a full revolution. The Singapore Flyer is the height of a 42-storey building 鈥?that鈥檚 some 30 metres taller than the famed London Eye!! Each capsule is capable of holding 28 passengers, or up to five wheelchairs and 15 other visitors when booked in advance for use by disabled guests. Wheelchair ramps and lifts, handicapped toilets, and a dedicated parking lot for the disabled are also provided. Taking a flight on this S$240 million wheel is a 鈥榦ne-of-a-kind鈥?experience one wouldn鈥檛 want to miss. However, shortage of time did not allow us to take a ride on this giant wheel, which we thoroughly regretted!
The Singapore Flyer opened in 2008, with its construction having taken about 2陆 years. We discovered that on the ground level, one can try out a flight simulator and enjoy a myriad of dining options and attractions. At the base of the wheel, in the central atrium, is Rainforest 鈥楧iscovery鈥? where one can follow the 5 paths which meander through lush vegetation, complete with waterfalls. The cascading water displays, streams, rocky outcrops and pond fuse together naturally to offer a picturesque landscape for photo taking. The latest attraction at the base of the wheel is 鈥楯ourney of Dreams鈥? which uses multimedia to highlight Singapore's history and learn about how the Wheel works. One will learn about how the wheel came about and how old Singapore became the modern phenomenon that it is today.",,,
,,Views forever...,5,,"Fantastic!
The approximately 30 minute rotation of the Flyer gives you plenty of opportunity to see across Singapore and take some happy snaps.
Mostly standing room but, seats are available.
I was on the Flyer for National Day and saw jets, paragliders and helicopters performing.
The commentary is very good and points out places of interest.",,,
,,Giant,4,,View of the city is great. Missed the night view though. A must visit for all. Great engineering indeed.,,,
,,Not worth paying the price for the view,3,,"The views are nice no doubt but I feel paying $33 is not worth the price. The Marina Bay Sands SkyPark is a lot better in terms of view, experience and price ($23). Not a must-do in Singapore and recommend it only as a one-time experience.",,,
,,DO it twice,5,,"I like high places. I like ferris wheels of all types and I like the Singapore Flyer. The cabins are large enough that I can gawk and take pictures and move around without feeling like I might fall. Do it twice, I did during a bright afternoon and early evening. Remember that early evening is just after 6 and the view of the Super Trees and the Sands Bay Hotel is both intriguing and overwhelming. Didn't get there, but loved the view.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer top of the world,5,,You really do feel as if you are on top of the world or at least Singapore city. Fantastic view especially if you can time your visit so that you are at the top of the wheel when the city lights have come on.,,,
,,Not as scary as expected!,4,,We wanted to fit in as much of Singapore in 3 days as we could. Not being a favourite of heights we hesitated on booking the cable car. I鈥檓 so glad we went - great views and worth any initial jitters.,,,
,,Should do,4,,Great time is during sun set. There are also lots of small eating places nearby. Early night is to avoid due to long waiting.,,,
,,GOOD VIEW!,5,,"If you鈥檝e done the Eye in London this is similar without the huge queues! We bought tickets on the day (afternoon), it was efficient and offers great views of the Marina and Gardens by the Bay. Reasonably price would maybe recommend a night flight but you can鈥檛 do everything at night in Singers!!",,,
,,Breathtaking Views of Singapore,4,,"Singapore is a beautiful city and there is no better way of enjoying the beautiful scenery and landscape than from the Singapore Flyer. It's about a 20 minute slow ride which lets you immerse in the sights of the city. Close proximity to Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by The Bay, F1 track and Merlion means that you get a good viewing of these iconic spots. There is some seating space in the centre and you can walk around all four sides to explore various vantage points. Each cabin accomodates about eight people on an average meaning it's not overcrowded but that also depends on how much of a waiting line there is to get in. Speaking of which - we only had to wait about 10 minutes to get in. Inside the cabin there also screens which offer you information about the various sights. Would recommend going there at the start of your Singapore trip so that you can what all there is to explore in the city. We wanted to catch the sunset views but arrived before time. But the early evening views were also breath taking.",,,
,,Great for photos and videa,5,,"After visiting gardens by the bay we decided to go to the Singapore flyer since it was not far. It is definitely worth visiting. I did not have a chance to go to the Marina Sands sky park but this was definitely a substitute, not to be missed. August 2017",,,
,,Don't bother if raining,3,,"Having been on the London Eye and the Melbourne Star Observation Wheels my children were excited to go on the Singapore Flyer but when we found time in a busy schedule to finally ride we arrived in a thunderstorm and the Flyer was closed. We waited for ages after the storm passed but they were in no hurry to resume operations until all the capsules and walkway were dried. Bad design as it rains a lot in Singapore! When we did eventually get on it was a great ride, the interactive screens pointed out landmarks and the view was amazing. Glad we got on but won't bother again as too many other things to do.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Originally the Singapore Flyer was not on my list of 'to-do' but I am so glad I did this. Before you enter you undergo a security check, I didn't have to queue because it was fairly quiet. I was fortunate to be the only person in my cabin so had full access to 360 degree views. I visited at approx. 5.30pm when there were few people around. Initially I thought I may be fearful of the height, surrounded by so much glass. The only time I really noticed the height was when the announcement came over the speaker to say I was at the top of the Flyer at a height of ??? The large cabins which would hold approx. 24 people are nearly all glass with a row of seating in the centre of the cabin and hand rails near the windows, there is a speaker which gives information from time to time. From the Flyer you gained a great view over the Grand Prix track which was being set up ready for the Grand Prix in September, the bay, the Cloud & Flower Domes, the Super Grove, Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore City.",,,
,,Great trip,5,,"Visited yesterday. $33.00/person. Air conditioned capsules, parking across the street. Neat but expensive food stalls and shops.",,,
,,Don鈥檛 be afraid if heights,5,,This is very high and moves slowly. It is very stable and the view magnificent. Absolutely worth it.,,,
,,Fun Time at the big top!,5,,"first I was a bit scared to go but when I get on it is very fun, all the way up then my carriage stop at top for some time :)",,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Get there early! We arrived at opening time, redeemed our voucher and literally walked on straight away with only 4 others in our capsule. It was an incredible journey over 32 minutes. Fabulous views, great commentary and lots of opportunities for photographs. As we were leaving we noticed the huge lines of people trying to get on the attraction at 11.30.",,,
,,Great Views of Singapore to be Enjoyed,5,,"I did the London Eye in May and the ride is essentially the same. The experience is exactly the same in enjoying fantastic views in all directions including over the ships waiting offshore, the Singapore surrounds plus the distance views towards Malaysia.
This view should be a must for each visitor as it really helps you to identify some of the other major attractions and where they are situated.
They were setting up for the F1 Grand Prix when we were there so we also got a view of the track layout as a bonus.",,,
,,MAGNIFICENT VIEW OF SINGAPORE CITY,4,,"Woow!!!!, the experience was awesome, a slow visit of the a made touristic attraction from Marina sands to beautiful glassy city that Singapore is. A recommendation to nature lovers for a view from the top. Great!!!.",,,
,,See the views,5,,I thought this was a wonderful experience even though I don't like heights. You get to see so much from up top. Well worth it ...,,,
,,Wonderful experience,5,,We chose to take the 7.30 pm Singapore sling ride. We were able to bypass the crowds and were taken straight to our carriage where our Singapore slings were waiting with nibbles. The view at night was amazing and the show at the gardens by the bay was happening at the same time so it made our ride spectacular.,,,
,,Survived my fear of heights,5,,"I have fear of heights but when i saw the beauty of singapore from this ferris wheel, i forgot all about my fear. you should really try this one.",,,
,,Great Views of Singapore,5,,The Flyer is great way to see Singapore with commentary inside each capsule. We did the Flyer on our first stop of the Hippo Hop On Hop Off Bus. I鈥檇 highly recommend going on it early in the morning just after opening time as you鈥檒l have a good chance of getting a capsule to yourself. We had five family members & had great access to all of the views to take photos of whatever we liked. It was also good to get an idea of where we wanted to stop on the Hippo Hop On Hop Off Bus & also what lines we needed to go on. It takes approximately 30 minutes for the Flyer to go around.,,,
,,A nice spin,5,,"I missed many chances to ride wheels like London Eye, The wheel of Abu Dhabi and Fujairah wheel. But I was lucky enough and I was determined not to miss The Singapore Flyer. I enjoyed the ride very much and I had the chance to enjoy the view of most of the city (country) from above, with a glimpse of Indonesian islands from one side and green Malaysian borders from the other side as well. the ride takes around 30 mins and you may like to take your ride in the morning or enjoy the lights by night so it's up to your taste. And when it comes to the taste, some special flights are associated with champagne and some others include dinner but of course it would cost you more dollars! In all cases this ride is not to be missed if you are visiting Singapore for a few days.",,,
,,Great view but a bit steep a price to pay for it.,4,,"The flyer is great to get a view of the city, it's magnanimity and sprawling buildings but I don't think it's worth the price tag. Suggest doing the round during sunset or later, timed with the light and sound show by the promenade.",,,
,,Great View,4,,"Without doubt a must out of Singapore's attractions. It offers great views of the vity and a chance to learn from Singapore from the videos presented in the cabin. It is suitable for everyone, as due to its speed it does not feel like you're meters away from the ground.",,,
,,Excellent view of Singapore,4,,"Singapore flyer is giant wheel rotating with very slow speed.There are total 28 capsules and each carries about 10 to 12 people .It makes one round within 30 minutes. The capsule is totally enclosd and very safe. we can move in the capsule and take photos of Singapore city,It is better to visit late night after Visit to Garden by the bay and laser shows at OCBC skyway
The charges are 33 Singapore Dollars .Taxis are available late night",,,
,,Too expensive,4,,"We had nowhere else to go until we saw this humongous ride in the sky. We walked for not less than 30 minutes hoping to try it out... to our dismay, the ride cost too much and so we decided to just enjoy the grounds and the fed the pigeons in the area. There are lots of food options (hawkers) as well as ice cream and pastry stops. Although we were not able to take the ride, the overall experience was good.",,,
,,See Singapore from the Sky,5,,"100% worth doing even if you are scared of heights ,I was very nervous to start with but once I was up I enjoyed it, you see so much from those pods . My advice is go as near to opening time(09.00) as possible that way you may like us end up in a pod with no one else",,,
,,I Wish I Could Fly,4,,"Don't we all! But no, I mean it...the darn thing is currently out of action! So, whilst staying with a friend for three weeks who happens to live on the 33rd floor of a building that looks over towards Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer, I got to see the Flyer lit up every night in all it's glorious splendour but never got to experience the ride...or a different view to the one I had. So, just like a health conscious person looking at a beautiful cream bun with chocolate on top and strawberry on the inside, I got to experience the visual delight of the Flyer and imagine the joy of it, without ever actually taking a bite!",,,
,,Great!!,5,,"Thoroughly recommend this attraction,
We took the Singapore Sling evening ride, I suggest doing it at around 7.30-8pm so as to take in the Gardens and Marina Bay laser light shows.
We were greeted by very friendly staff, skipped the queue and shared our capsule with an English family, which meant that there was only 6 of us. The Singapore Sling cocktail was great and we were also given snacks as well.
The ride lasted for 30 minutes which was plenty of time to take in the lights and views.
Thank you to all involved. Thoroughly recommended",,,
,,Good place to view Singapore,3,,"The flyer may not provide the high up view as MBS, but you can capture the MBS in your photos along with the other famous buildings or attractions of Singapore. You will be surprise how fast the whole experience is over when you were busy taking photos. If this is your first trip to Singapore, this is one of the must see attraction.",,,
,,Night would be a better time to visit than evening,4,,"the rotation as such is pretty slow as is expected. it takes about 40 mins for a rotation. Old people will also be able to enjoy. Though I went to the flyer around 4 pm, it would be better to go at night.",,,
,,Amazing views!!,5,,"This is one of the large Ferris wheels in the world and the cabins are beautiful. We arrived on opening at 8.30am and had a whole cabin to ourselves. The air was also very clear that early in the morning so we highly recommend starting your Singapore experience there!!
Loved the experience",,,
,,Nice views,3,,"It is a bit of a wall to get to from public transport and the surrounds are run down. I think they expected many more people would come to this attraction, but they are not. The internal displays were of poor quality. The capsules were of a high standard and the views were good. You can get better views from Marina Bay Sands. Ok if you have an hour or two spare.",,,
,,Spectacular view,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is similar to the one in London, Las Vegas etc. The view is always worth it. You can see everything from up there, it's like flying in slow motion. Always a thrill!",,,
,,Fabulous!,5,,"Highly recommend a trip around in the Flyer. It only takes half an hour and you can take photos of everything from every aspect. Great views of Gardens By The Bay, and Marina Bay. Only costs $33. Must do!",,,
,,So awesome,5,,"I got lucky and got a chance to go after sunset. This was totally cool with the views and those famous hotels in lights. Pacing is good, not too fast you feel rushed and not too slow to get restless. I only had 24 hours in Singapore and it turned in to a highlight. Shout out to Kim and TJ who I met on the Flyer.",,,
,,A must do,5,,Went here on my last day in Singapore and I鈥檓 really glad I did. Ended up being one of my highlights of my trip. What a view. I reckon I took 100 photo. My husband and I had a pod to ourselves and we could walk around taking pics to our hearts content. This is one of the things I highly recommend doing when in Singapore. Cost $33 ea but a must do.,,,
,,Loved This,4,,"A very good experience, not badly priced and very efficiently run. Gives a lovely three hundred and sixty degree view of the City our bonus was no queues ( about 11.00am on a Tuesday). Fairly easy to get to as well.",,,
,,As good as the London eye.,5,,"Singapore flyer is as good as the London eye. Equally breathtaking views of the marina bay, the Marina Bay Sands and all other eye catchers of Singapore. The speed is very gentle and gives you enough time for photos.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Very nice views of the city. I always love looking at a city from above. It was well organized and efficient, as with most everything in Singapore. The views were great the entire of trip. Just the right amount of time to get up, stay at the top, and come back down. There is a great video playing as well, which points out all the sights along the way. Cars are spacious and at the time I went there were only 14 people per car so very spacious and plenty of room to move around.",,,
,,Birds Eye view over Singapore from 160m up,4,,"A good place to get your overall view, at 160m high at the top. We were lucky enough to have a full capsule to ourselves so being able to see without obstruction was a real bonus. Capsule is about 5m x 4m high internally & air conditioned. There is a lot of fluffing around sending you through walkways with the theme your going for a flight which I suppose for some might be interesting & suspect this somehow justifies the $30 odd for the ride. All that aside it was okay but wouldn鈥檛 do it again now I鈥檝e done it.",,,
,,"High atop the wheel, you can see forever",5,,Plan to spend about an hour on a slow rotation around the loop. I recommend the night visit with the advantage of bay and city light views.,,,
,,Great place for a romantic break.,5,,Go there at night and get a vip ticket with a glass of champagne. You get to skip the queue and share a cabin with another couple while you get a glass of champagne and chocolates with a breathtaking city view. Highly recommended,,,
,,Wonderful experience at dusk,4,,"My daughter & I made a decision in the late afternoon to go on the flyer. We were able to quickly book tickets on-line and make our way across the city by taxi. There were no queues so we raced through the exhibitions set up as pre-flight entertainment as we wanted to be on before the sun set.

The flight was amazing, we had a cabin to ourselves which was fun and meant we could easily move around without disturbing others. The views are wonderful and it moves at a slow pace for the 30 min flight.

Loved it, wouldn鈥檛 necessarily do it regularly but certainly provided us with wonderful memories.",,,
,,Flyer,5,,Though I'm afraid of heights. Thoroughly experienced the time spent in flyer. Marina bay F1 paddock are all visible from the glass cabin.,,,
,,"Expensive, but brillant Fun",4,,"We tried the visit around 8 pm. Waiting time were 40 min - and the prediction was precise. When we entered one of the cabins I was surprised how much space was inside. You can move free to every corner of the cabin and get a breathtaking view over the bay and skyline, although the windows were partly fogged. The price (33 SD for adult) is high, but in my opinion it鈥榮 worth.",,,
,,Awesome view,5,,"I was initially sceptical about this as it looks slow and a bit boring... I was very wrong

Such a great way to see the city and out to the port area. Definitely with half an hour of your visit to Singapore to see it from this angle.

Was a little tricky to know how to get back to the city / suntec which would be my only criticism",,,
,,Great views,5,,A great 30mins giving you amazing views. Visited mid afternoon on a Friday and no real queues. Didn鈥檛 go at night.,,,
,,Incredible view,5,,Couldn't miss taking this ride to get the full aerial view of Singapore skyline. I was just sitting the whole time though cause I'm so scared of heights :(,,,
,,Great view,4,,We got here after 9pm at night on a Saturday and found the ques almost non existence. We just did the straight ride with no ad ons. There were probably another ten people in our carriage. There was plenty of room to sit and or walk around and heaps of opportunity to take photos.. Views of Singapore lights at night were great. I would have said the best but we went to bar 1-Altitude a couple of nights later and the view from there was magical. So if you were adults and short on time I鈥檇 probably go to 1 -Altitude over this.,,,
,,excellent 360 deg. view,5,,This provides a overall viewing platform of Singapore skyline from all directions. Capsules are very comfortable and ride is enjoyable.,,,
,,Asia's largest eye,4,,Can't miss this icon in downtown Singapore. Worth taking a ride to have aerial view of Singapore's skyline. Great for young families.,,,
,,Spectacular View,5,,"A must see attraction AT NIGHT, when Singapore lights make the city even more beautiful! A little expensive, but worth it!",,,
,,food is not good,2,,food and service was not good and there were some technical problems with the ride. I would not recommend this experience when there are so many other wonderful things to do in Singapore.,,,
,,Great view but very expensive,3,,"It didn't even last 30 min (which they say it does), the view was pretty but not as astonishing I thought it would be, and even though we got a discount for being born in August (National day is August 9th) and going in August it was still VERY expensive.",,,
,,A great way to get a bird's eye view of Singapore,5,,A must do if you want to orientate yourself in the Singapore landscape. Really enjoyed this activity and the view was amazing. Would recommend for all visitors.,,,
,,Beautiful views,3,,We shared our cabin with a large group of loud tourists which dampened the experience somewhat. But the views were great. It is a pricey 30 minutes worth of city views though,,,
,,Great,4,,Missed doing this last year so was top of the list this time around. Honestly found it fairly pricey but who am I to complain. Pretty quiet for a Saturday arvo and we only waited few minutes to get on. Not sure if they do it when it busier but maybe break groups down into couples/Familys (without trying to sound like a troll) we had to familys with kids who don't really take to the concept of heights,,,
,,Singapore stopover,4,,"We had a Singapore holiday pass and one of the items on the pass was the Singapore Flyer.
I would certainly recommend the Flyer to anyone visiting Singapore the view was amazing. It takes 30 minutes to go full circle and there is ample room in the capsule as well as seating.",,,
,,Overpriced for 30 minutes experience,3,,"I have been on the flyer for at least 3 times during my college days when it just started and recently while bringing my friends from overseas around. I would highly recommend to take the flyer at night although day view is pretty good as I personally prefer the night view.

Each cabin is pretty huge so if you are not going in a big group do expect to share each cabin with other visitors. A full round is approximately 30minutes.

Overall I would say it is a pretty nice experience but on the pricey end. More of once for the hype and never again kind of thing.",,,
,,Architectural marvel,5,,It's Asia's largest giant observation wheel with breathtaking views of the Marina bay and beyond. It's a 360 degrees feast of most landmarks in Singapore,,,
,,Amazing views,5,,Although heights aren鈥檛 my thing the views from the flyer are just amazing. Clean and efficient and only a short walk away from the Gardens.,,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"Amazing views, friendly staff. Not many people in each pod. Great experience. Plenty of time to take plenty of photos",,,
,,Long cues but worth it,3,,Took about one hour to get into the capsule then 40 minutes to see the sights. Overall it was worth it.,,,
,,Mind Blowing Views of Singapore,5,,This is the way to get a birds eye view of all the buildings and those under construction in Singapore.They leave other countries 鈥?for dead鈥?in their foresight and ability to build structures.Also the view of the port activities was interesting as well. A MUST SEE!,,,
,,A sight to see!,5,,"The Flyer also has places to walk where you can see coy fish and beautiful birds in the winding tropical area under the Flyer. Amazing view and well worth it, especially if you can see the Flyer at night, SO amazing!",,,
,,Amazing views,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is the highest ferris wheel in the world - and stands at 165 metres high. The diameter of the wheel is 150 metres. The flyer was opened in 2008.

Opening hours are from 8.30am to 10.30pm - the last admission is at 10pm.

As with all the ferris wheels in the world - you get great views. The Singapore Flyer is no exception - you get amazing views of the city and surrounding areas.

Admission prices are Singapore Dollars 33 for adults (13 years and over). It is SGD21 for children from 3 to 12 years of age. Tickets for the elderly are SGD 24.

Each trip (flight) lasts 30 minutes.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"I have been on the Singapore Flyer more than once, whenever I purchase a Singapore Explorer Pass for a stopover.

I have usually visited this attraction in the morning and there has never been any wait to get a cabin.

There are great views of Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay and up the Singapore River. On this visit, we had been on a river cruise up to the Clarke Quay area, so it as good to see the colonial buildings along the river from a different vantage point and to work out where the beachfront used to be.",,,
,,Great view,4,,We arrived during the day and found the view was fantastic and wait time was short. The Formula one track was being set up and what looked like pit lane was near by.,,,
,,The London Eye wishes it had these views!,5,,"It鈥檚 been a few days since our visit to the Singapore flyer and my 9 year old still feels it was the best part of our trip to Singapore . She simply loved it and so did the rest of the family. Barely any wait time and the staff was very nice and attentive. The capsules weren鈥檛 crowded at all which allowed us to fully enjoy the 30 minute ride. We have ridden in the London eye as well, but this experience was different and the beauty surroundings made it fun and interesting at the same time!",,,
,,Honeymoon ride in the sky,5,,"My wife & I went here as part of our honeymoon in April 2017. The view is spectacular! & if u pay a little extra u can have the cab all to yourself & have the privacy to take photos with the Singapore skyline as your backdrop!

It's quite the experience! Highly recommended!",,,
,,A perfect Way to View the City,4,,"The ferris wheel was a good addition to Singapore鈥檚 attractions similar to London鈥檚 and other places with the same. It provides excellent view of the city, bay, strait, and surrounding communities. Price is decent. Bring your love one for a romantic scenery specially at sunset.",,,
,,"Great view, but not necessarily a must-do",4,,"We had a Singapore Stopover deal and the Flyer is included, so we had to redeem our vouchers in a separate ticket line. Waiting time was not very long at 1pm on a Thursday. No line at the entrance, and less than 10mins wait to get on the flyer. Whole ride is about half an hour and is slow enough for plenty of photos. The capsules have bench seats in the centre so you can alternate between walking around or sitting. Staff did not overcrowd the capsules, but maybe it's different on busier days. It's a great overview of Marina Bay and the Harbour to get your bearings of the area and see some of the major sights. We felt very jet-lagged after flying overnight from London and this is a nice, easy to do experience but not necessarily a must do in Singapore, especially if you are planning any other high-rise viewing options.",,,
,,Breathtaking view,5,,Just Wow! Amazing and exquisite view of Singapore skyline. It鈥檚 a 360view of the city. The cabins are cozy and well maintained. The ride sadly lasts for only 30minutes but it鈥檚 an opportunity once shouldn鈥檛 miss. Must visit at least once for the wonderful experience.,,,
,,Scenic views for miles,5,,"Great value way of seeing the lights of Singapore, very well organised and a well worth the ride. There was a long queue but it moved well and staff were courteous",,,
,,Glorious view,5,,A 30 minute round trip on the wheel in a capsule. Recommended to visit before noon as it gets quite busy after. You may then be lucky enough to have a capsule to yourselves and enjoy the flight. Not to be missed,,,
,,Best view of Singapore,4,,"If you want a nice view of Singapore, the harbor and bay area this is very nice. The family enjoyed the 30 minutes trip.",,,
,,Awesome experience!!,5,,My hubby and I went on this one night around 7.00pm and it was amazing! It takes about 30 minutes to go round and it's completely safe. Best photo opportunity and very romantic.,,,
,,out of the world,5,,"thirty to forty min of the gentle ride on the singalore flier gives u a feeling that u are on the top of hthe world..and u can not only see the city , u can alos seee the ships in hundrends docked in the sea... also its avery very kind of private space for u and u r family to enjoy those few minute un disturbed",,,
,,Well worth the money,4,,Terrific little jaunt. The journey is gentle and slow and you don't feel boxed in or crowded at any stage. We were lucky enough to have a clear day so the views were lovely.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"The flyer is an air conditioned sightseeing wheel in the style of the lid on eye. It can be found on the waterfront by the F1 track grandstand and is about a 5 minute walk from the Promenade MRT Station. Thr wheel slowly rotates to its full height of 165metres giving fantastic views of Singapore including the downtown skyscrapers and marina bay sands, the gardens by the bay, national stadium etc. It is tinted glass and air conditioned capsules and is cool and comfortable in side. There are often discounts fir tickets if you use certain cards to pay and there are places to eat and drink at the base.",,,
,,Very happy I did it,4,,"The views here are pretty amazing. Definitely worth doing at night. The biggest downside really is all the lights ON the flyer causing interference with pictures and just general enjoyment. With that being said, I thought it was great!",,,
,,Amazing,5,,"I visited Singapore flyer 2-3 times, my first visit was with my children. They enjoy the place very much as the they can see the singapore lights and buildings at night. The movement is very slow, enough time to see the while Singapore, you will see all sides because it is made up glasses, it is very huge can accommodate many people inside and you don't need to worry coz you will have the chance to see all sides. My second visit was with my collegues, this time i appreciate both day light and evening time. Its the best time to visit Singapore flyer both you can see daylight and night time. Not only that, while walking to the flyer itself, my children was very much entertained with the attractions inside. Its good for family treat and even for a dinner date or a family dinner moving up high",,,
,,See Singapore with spectacular views from the Flyer,5,,A great way to see the whole of Singapore. Comfortable capsules to sit in or stand in to take in the whole of Singapore.,,,
,,Nice experience but don't think it's a must do,4,,"Came here on a Sunday around 530-6pm. Ticket line wasn鈥檛 too bad, about 10mins. No line at entrance, and about 10mins wait to get on the flyer. Whole ride is about half an hour. I also added the bird eye view from the highest point. It鈥檚 a nice experience but I don鈥檛 think it鈥檚 a must do in Singapore.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer Spectacular At Night,5,,The Singapore Flyer offered magnificent views of the city around the river at night. The movement of the Flyer was sufficiently slow to allow you to take in the sights on either side of the cabin and there was generous space to move around. Singapore Airlines boarding passes enable a discount.,,,
,,Some good views of singapore,4,,"A bit expensive, but everything is in Singapore. Make sure you get a nice day and sit back and enjoy the view unfold. The Cars are big so you can get up and walk around. The main decision should be either a city at night or day view. A bit touristy but a need to do.",,,
,,Should do in Singapore,4,,We had little line when we arrived in the afternoon. The capsule was full but there was still room to move around and see what you wanted to see. Worth the expense.,,,
,,Must do In Singapore,4,,"We were lucky the day we went as we had a pod to ourselves so we could get a lot of photos and really enjoy the view without dodging people!
Highly recommend to do this The views are amazing and you don't realise how green Singapore is until you see it from up there. . The staff were very friendly and the pods were clean. Highly recommend.",,,
,,Must do,4,,The Singapore flyer is a must do while during your visit. Gorgeous views and informative video playing as well. We were lucky enough to arrive while there was no line. Definitely worth doing.,,,
,,At the top ... breathtaking views of SG,5,,A bit on the expensive side but worth the money. Big spacious capsules with adequate space to seat for around 10-12 persons in each capsule. VIews are awesome from the top. I felt the ridetime should be increased by another 15 minutes to let people enjoy more at the top...,,,
,,Great view of the city,5,,Amazing views of the city. We went early so had a capsule to ourselves. The music which played the whole time was extremely repetitive.,,,
,,Up up and away,5,,"This is another must while in Singapore we had already done the day experience so decided to go at night, the sights once again are beautiful with the lights all around although you are unable to pickup the distance its well worth the trip.
It can be a bit expensive for a family with a adult ticket at $33 and a child up to 12 or 13 around $26 or so but the ride does last for about 30 minutes, you can also expect to wait at night as the lines are long we had a 40 minute wait but once onboard the views both during the day or night are spectacular so don't forget to have some form of capturing the shots.
We thought we might have also been able to view and get some film of the nightly light show at gardens by the bay and the laser show at marina bay sands, although you can see both from the flyer plan your trip to go to both these places it's only a short bus trip as the distance to film is a bit far.
You can also get a meal drink have a ice cream do some shopping they have I think a 3 or 4 D simulation ride theatre a full plane flight simulator experience so all in all you could spend both some time and money there if you have both.",,,
,,Not anything special,3,,"The Flyer was a slow-moving ferris wheel in which 12 people are put into a car and have some fun views of the city. However, it was just too many people taking pictures during the entire ride, not really courteous to others, and the views weren't that special. Especially if you do the SkyPark at Marina Bay Sands. If I were to do it over again, I'd skip this.",,,
,,It was under maintenane,3,,"During out visit to Singapore, the flyer was under maintenance. However the location of flyer is awsome. We may feel how it will be to be a part of flyer. It may provide a birds eye view of complete singapore. The same you may feel by taking a ride to rope way at Santosa",,,
,,Gem of Singapore,5,,I didn't regretted boarding it late evening as the whole city was in the blanket of busting crackers which added an exceptional view from the top,,,
,,A little expensive!,4,,"A great attraction which can give some amazing views of the city, however it is a little on the pricier side, which most things in Singapore are. If you are trying to save money, I would say skip it, but if you can afford it, then it's definitely worth it",,,
,,"Must to go,,loved it",5,,"Wow superb views from the heights also the whole experience is simply awesome, the ride takes almost 30 minutes upward, but minutes just fly like the flyer itself",,,
,,Great tourist spot,5,,"Very great place for tourist if they visit Singapore, with family or with friends. I recommend it though if you only make it during sunny time because the view in Singapore is so much better.",,,
,,Good location to discover Singapore from the sky,4,,"Good location to discover Singapore from the sky. Takes 30 minutes to go around in the capsule, best time to go is at sunset or at night. expect up to an hour wait if you haven't booked a head",,,
,,Nice views,5,,"The Flyer was a nice way to get a good view and impression of this lovely City State.
The price (33 S$) is cheap compared to the London Eye and the wheel is bigger.

Have to be slightly lucky when the weather isn鈥檛 great - they like to close the flyer due to 鈥榖ad weather鈥?..",,,
,,Singapore trip,5,,Love this ride. Fantastic views across the city from all angles. The ride is nice and slow so you can really enjoy. Well worth the money.,,,
,,Top of Asia's prettiest City,4,,"This is exactly the kind of cheesy touristy thing I would never do. But reality is that it is a cool piece of engineering in a perfect location for one of the worlds prettiest cities. The skyline view is there, Sea view. Its all well run, very orderly, very Singaporean experience. price is reasonable for a very expensice city.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,3,,I did not enjoy much as I suffer from vertigo. The scenery from top is beautiful. It moves slowly so u can cherish every moment,,,
,,Bigger than London Eye - very cool cityscape views,4,,"We took this ride just after dark to see Singapore by night. The queue didn't look too bad, but it does snake around inside the buidings a bit, so it was somewhat deceptive. The ride however once on it provided some amazing views across Singapore by night - it's great city to see from the Singapore Flyer Observation platform. It doesn't look it, but it is also bigger than the London Eye, providing excellent viewing opportunities for the 'Flyer'",,,
,,A huge wheel is amazing and worth a visit,5,,"A huge wheel is amazing and worth a visit The place is very clean, well maintained, and there are not too many queues for this attraction. Really worth it. See all of Singapore from it. Just a fun experience. Highly recommended.",,,
,,bird's-eye view,5,,"Giant wheel with multiple pods for people to enjoy 360 view of Singapore. From oceans on one side, commercial buildings on the other, one of the must visit attractions",,,
,,Good view of course,4,,"Iconic now, and a must do when in Singapore. I think of all the big wheels this one gives the best views.",,,
,,"Great views, long line",4,,Beautiful views of Singapore. We went at night. We had to queue for quite a while which was a bit annoying but the line did move reasonably quickly. Just make sure you factor in time for this. We went as a part of a Singapore Airlines Stopover deal so our ride was included and we didn't have to pay extra for it which was a great inclusion. The views are worth it and it's an exhilarating experience as well.,,,
,,slow for savoring scenic singapore,4,,"this huge ferris wheel has 28 airconditioned capsules that can accommodate each up to 28 people, with three-storey terminals being used simultaneously. it has been the tallest ferrist wheel in the world for 6 yrs (2008-2014) but the widest in diameter is still in China.

after the exit, a souvenir shop awaits the still exhilirated passenger, subliminally enticing her to buy all those items which she finds either cute or memorable, eventually draining her pocket money. but what the heck, the chance of riding the SG Flyer only comes once and you might as well savor the moment.",,,
,,Fantastic views!,5,,"We enjoyed this ride. We went at dusk as the city lights were comming on. The cabs are spacious, clean and air conditioned. Plenty of seats in the middle with ample room to walk around and take pictures.",,,
,,Not worth the $$$,2,,"I've had the ability to get on a few of these around the world, this one is not only the most expensive, but also one of the most uninspiring, feel free to go if you have nothing better to do and are willing to throw $50+ per person",,,
,,Same same,3,,"Visited 10 years ago and now, nothing much changed just the views were a bit different from the last time.",,,
,,Take the extra tour,4,,We chose the Singapore Sling experience and walked past the crowds to catch a gondola with just the four of us and a Singapore Sling to enjoy. Views amazing but at night flashes make good pics hard to capture. Fun!,,,
,,Amazing view,4,,"You can either choose the Singapore flyer or Marina Bay sands. The view from the Marin ais better but this was a good experience, only issue is that you get a decent view once you reach a certain altitude but more than 50% of the ride is boring. Would rather suggest doing the cable car or Marina Bay sands or one altitude or the tiger sky ride in Sentosa",,,
,,Great panoramic view,5,,"Great ferris wheel, it wasn't just take a simple round. You'll get information about the city, and inform you about the surrounding places. Plenty of time at the highest point. Panoramic view for the whole city.",,,
,,Looked like fun,5,,"Make sure you make time to go, we didn't get the chance. Just so much to see and not enough time, the surrounding area was magnificent to say the least. And walk walk walk so you don't miss a single thing.",,,
,,Above the City!,5,,"Singapore Flyer is simply awesome. You will get stunned by the 360* views it offers. Amazing views of the city, harbor, the ships in the sea, the marina bay, the marina bay F1 circuit etc. I liked the Singapore Flyer more than the London and Melbourne one's. And compared to all other flyers in the world, Singapore Flyer is the biggest according to height. Good quality time spent in the flyer. Should certainly be on the top priority list of Singapore.",,,
,,Me too attraction,3,,"Another ferris wheel, one of loads all round the world. Being an island, there is not a lot to see while cruising on board the ferris wheel. There are several other attractions to view the island from, without having to queue for the ride.",,,
,,Good Place must visit,5,,"One must visit if not, the tour is meaningless. A giant wheel, people can sit in safety chairs, it's goes up and up, if the chairs are being filled... You will reach the top and see almost all Singapore.
We used Open top bus, to reach the place. the price for the open bus is reasonable the ticket for the open bus valid for the day 24 hrs, you can get down from one bus after visiting places you can use the same color bus to other designated place.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Its amazing and not to be missed, kids will love it and you can view so many tourist attractions. It roughly for about 45 Minutes.",,,
,,Lovely trip to give a different perspective,5,,The views were stunning. Lots of points of interest that could not be seen from the ground. It felt very safe. The gardens and water features below to sit and wait were lovely.,,,
,,Very cool city view,4,,"Went here at night, no crowds, got to see the city all lit up, very nice experience. The cars are air conditioned which was a huge plus for me! 30 minutes on the flyer, amazing views, worth doing if you have the time.",,,
,,very very nice.,5,,took this ride twice once during the day and once at night. definitely a must try for those visiting Singapore. the view at night with the lights is gorgeous.,,,
,,weekend birthday,5,,we did a night ride with a Singapore sling theme. cost 138 singapore for 2 of us. we pre booked and had a terrific night veiw of the city lights. we were luck that they were doing a rehearsal for the Singapore birthday for next month and got to see fireworks while going around..,,,
,,Views of Singapore,5,,Take a bus to the Wheel. Found it a bid odd that the end where you go upstairs to the wheel entrance is closed and you have to go to the other end of the site to buy tickets. wheel goes very slowly that you hardly notice it moving,,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,Awesome experience! Great evening! Not to miss. You can have dinner too. We visited in the evening but I鈥檓 sure the daytime view will also be splendid,,,
,,What a Buzz!!!,5,,An amazing structure and an even more amazing experience to ride the Flyer. The commentary was fantastic and the staff on the entry and exit routes were equally good.,,,
,,Great experience a the best view of the Bay and Bay Garden,5,,"We took the tour on the Singapore flyer on a rainy day, still a big experience and the lines are a lot shorter than London Eye despite the Singapore flyer being bigger.

Great views of the bay, The hotels, city and the Garden by the bay

A must do when in Singapore

Prices are ok considering what and where",,,
,,GRAND FAMILY TRIP,4,,"It is good to have an experience with this flyer. But for the people who have experienced ride on London Eye, may skip this.

The view from the flyer is good, the speed is slow and worth enjoying.

The advertisements put up at the entrance show the height of the highest cubicle is more than or equal to the height of nearby Marina Bay Sands, but in reality, as you reach the topmost position, you realise that the height of the top-most cubicle is much less than the top floor of Marina Bay Sands.",,,
,,Awesome View,4,,I brought my family there in the evening time as I don鈥檛 like to be too sunny. In the evening time it鈥檚 also beautiful. U can see awesome view of Singapore. Our beautiful homeland.,,,
,,Round trip to see Singapore from top.,4,,"It was a great experience to see Singapore from the flyer. During twilight time, we had a chalcedony of colours on the horizon and glistening and Glimmering skyscrapers at the backdrop. It was a unique experience on a warm night. Overall, an unforgettable experience.",,,
,,Good view of the citry,3,,It provides good view of the whole city and you can enjoy seeing the sky scrappers. The access from the train station is not straight forward also they need to have couple of other attraction in close vicinity so enjoy in package.,,,
,,Good flyer but expensive,3,,"While tis is a must do in Singapore at least once, it is a very expensive exercise for families. I would leave this if your budget is tight and rather do the lights or tress at MBS",,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"This is a must do, fantastic views from all angles, room to move and Wander around in the cage, information given as you go and Fantastic photo opportunities. We did this at night but think daytime would be better",,,
,,Good experience,4,,We've done the flyer everywhere we go. This was fun too. We visited in the eve so queues weren't as bad however you can't see much at a distance. Marina bay Sands hotel liked spectacular,,,
,,Great views,5,,The Flyer provides a great view and orientation of the city. Was only a few people in our pod so was great to be able to wander around and look at differing heights. Would recommend doing.,,,
,,Sunset,5,,This attraction cost you around SGD 33 for adult and SGD 25 for kids.. This attatraction 167 M above sea level. Sunser For best view.,,,
,,Mr Hemant Patel,5,,Very good well worth seeing Really nice city views and of Singapore Good value for money Well located All staff very helpful,,,
,,Great View,4,,"Did the tourist thing and went for a ride on the flyer, glad I did what a view. If you're in Singapore this is a must.",,,
,,Great for a view of the city,4,,"The Singapore flyer a good option, especilly in the evening when the city lights-up. Getting there, queing, and the ride of approx 30 minutes - plan for 1.5 hours in your schedule. Photos taken at the start are great and available with different backgrounds afterwards - but as many things in Singapore very pricey - especially when added to the price of the ticket already bought for the ride. Singapore stopover card holders you don't go to the main ticket counter, but the office just around corner to the left of the main ticket desk. Need flight details and asked some for passports.",,,
,,singapore flyer,5,,The singapore Flyer is worth a visit Superb views of the singapore skyline and the formula one track/sheds. hop on hop off bus. Also easy access by MRT (underground) or service buses,,,
,,Consider it a must do,4,,"I would consider this a must do when in Singapore. The view you get is well worth it. Also they dont push too many people in every cart, meaning the ride will be both comfortable and spacious.",,,
,,Splendid visit!,5,,"The Singapore flyer offers a very comfortable, cooling ride while you can see the entire Singapore city, business district and residential area in a 30 minutes journey.

There is a radio recorded audio guide during the journey that explains what you need to know about Singapore.

A very pleasant ride with plenty of beautiful scenic photos taken to bring the memories back home!

Will definitely suggest you to try it whenever you are in town!",,,
,,AMAZING TOUR WITH SINGAPORE FLYER,5,,"Hi Without Singapore flyer your Singapore trip is incomplete. its was amazing seen , you can watch all Singapore view by Singapore flyer. strongly recommended",,,
,,Nine attraction,4,,"Recommend to buy tickets in advance along with a print out, to avoid long queues. Offers excellent view of the singapore city",,,
,,Fabulous Ferris,5,,"Yes - it is a large ferris wheel. But it's oh so cool.
Big - high and with great cabins/gondolas that provide 360 degree views.

Lots to see with great views over Singapore; either day or night time. Hard to decide which is the best time to travel n it. Various packages on offer and it's not cheap.
But it is a great experience and one not to be missed if you are holidaying in Singapore.",,,
,,A bird's eye view,5,,"The big wheel is situated perfectly to give the visitor an intructory orientation to the city .
Overlooking various iconic structures of interest.
We visited during the day.
Tickets available at the venue. The hop-on-hop off tourist buses all use the Singapore flyer as a pickup/drop off point.
Within easy walking distance to the Merlion.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Lots to see and some interesting commentary. for about half an hour, you get to see a lot of the sights but if you're staying at Marina Bay Sands, it's probably not worth it because you see the same thing. The afternoon tea option looked interesting.",,,
,,Views!,5,,"This is the greatest ride to have in Singapore, you can see forever and it moves really slowly so you can easily take photos.",,,
,,Must visit,5,,We love the ride it took about half an hour to finish. You can see the city and learn about the different places.,,,
,,Good but...,2,,"I've been here 3 times.. but the last time, when me and my parents went there, when i want to exchange the ticket i already bought online, the staff not so friendly!!! When i said NOT i mean it.. which im a foreigner, if i need help or confused about the ticket, the staff in the cashier need to explain and more patient and nice to us... now i didnt want to go there again... You should asked ur staff to learn how to service people (specially tourist and foreigner) more nice and patient, because we PAY and a bit pricey too..",,,
,,Nice landscape,5,,"One of the must-go attractions in Singapore. You surely don鈥檛 want to miss a place where you can see the night view of Singapore. Recommended to board just before sunset. It鈥檚 hard to take a nice photo when it gets dark, as the lighting inside the carriage is quite bad.",,,
,,Night view is good,4,,"This is a good place to view Singapore from high, especially night view, you will have a lot of chance to take photo. But the only disadvantage is the ticket is not cheap.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Wonderful views of Singapore ,the Singapore Grand Prix race track is below, well worth the visit.There were also good harbour views with all of the sea traffic, watching the traffic on the highways and how quickly they got around the city was marvellous",,,
,,If you like Big Wheels you will love this one,5,,What a fabulous view of Singapore from this Big Wheel. The views over the waterfront are amazing. A must for an unforgettable experience?,,,
,,Good view of Singapore but thats it...,2,,It seems that by now people know that there isnt much to see and do at the Singapore Flyer. There was no queue at all to go in but the price was still too high for what we got: a quick tour (30'?) on the wheel with decent views of Singapore. Recommended if you have kids that are begging for it or if you are really bored otherwise nothing special.,,,
,,Watch the stars from the Singapore Flyer,5,,A ride in the Singapore flyer is a must when on a visit to Singapore. The enchanting view from the top of the flyer is difficult to describe in words. You can even arrange for a dine in option and enjoy your meal for a 30 minute ride which you will not realise as it moves slowly and there is no motion sickness.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer was Amazing,5,,We went on the Singapore Flyer a couple of weeks ago and were amazed by the fabulous view. A must do in Singapore.,,,
,,Great 30 Minutes,4,,"It was great at night. Someday i'd like to try at day time. The queue was long, and don't get happy, when we arrived, they took us a photo, it wasn't free, you neet to pay to get the results.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer Good Morning City,5,,We went to the Singapore Flyer in the morning. We have no queue at all. It was a good choice. Beautiful visibility. Cabin just for us. On screen all information. We also looked at the Singapore Formula One circuit.,,,
,,Awesome,4,,We went in the evening so just perfect to catch the sun set and the view is just beautiful. Seeing Singapore from this angle gives one more appreciation for the effort made to maintain this beautiful city.,,,
,,We did the wheel at dusk,5,,"We did the wheel at dusk, you can see all of the lights as they come on, the out line of the bays & the colours are great",,,
,,Fly High in the Flyer!,5,,"If you wish to experience a birds-eye-view of Singapore atop a giant wheel, boarding the Singapore Flyer is a must: to see the amazing peaks of modernity from all corners. The Flyer gives you 鈥?a 360 degree 鈥?panoramic and absorbing view of the maximum city. This giant wheel is a marvelous piece of engineering, and has multiple air-conditioned-see-through-capsules for its riders, with a seating capacity of about a dozen. One revolution is completed in about 40 minutes and the capsules reaches to a maximum elevation of 165 meters at the top. From the Flyer, you will see the seaside, Flower Domes, Gardens by the Bay, Art and Science Museum, towering Marina Bay Sands Hotel capped with the Infinity pool at the top, Commercial Business District skyline, bridges and flyovers and a fading glimpse of the renowned Merlion Park.

View from the Flyer is stunning and truly mesmerising, which is even better in the night when everything is electrified, bright and colourfully lit-up, enabling the entire integration of the city attractions to come alive beautifully in its full glory, glow and glitter 鈥?a fantastic treat to the eyes!

,,Lovely view,5,,It was great experience.....almost one hour time took for one flyer round. you can see whole singapore city. ticket cost is SGD33. its worth for the money.,,,
,,On top of the world,5,,Easy access great commentary and fun. A must do. This is very relaxing. You will actually not realise you are moving. Very gentle rotation.,,,
,,Don't leave Singapore without riding this!,4,,A great experience as the wheel slowly turns offering some magnificent views of Singapore harbour and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It take around 30 minutes to complete and you have every opportunity for photographing the sites.,,,
,,Views,5,,We went in daytime . Was veeyquiet just us and another couple in capsule . Great commentary throughout and great views of f1 track,,,
,,Full view of Singapore,4,,"Unike a giant wheel, this flyer moves very slowly and one catches the glimpse of whole Singapore while riding on this flier.",,,
,,Underwhelming!,1,,"We were excited to visit the Singapore Flyer, and were pleased to see that there was no waiting for a pod to arrive. In retrospect that was probably a bad sign. In fact we had a pod completely to ourselves which was great as it was air conditioned and comfortably cool.

The experience lasts around 30 minutes and gives a great view of the city. However, there isn鈥檛 that much to see, unlike the wonderful London Eye.

There are good views of the city, the Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, but that鈥檚 about it.

We had tickets as part of a package but wouldn鈥檛 pay to visit it under normal circumstances.",,,
,,Passes away 30 mins,4,,"This is a nice thing to do, you get beautiful views over the water and city. The pods are modern and it moves very smoothly. The shops and restaurants underneath are pleasant. We rented electric scooters it was the best fun ever.",,,
,,Singapore Eye,4,,"Although a little overcast, we had great views of the city and out over the bay. Interesting facts came up on the monitor. Heaps of great photos.",,,
,,Did the Singapore Flyer again.... even after a few times still find it Enjoyable,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a great way to see Singapore. It takes 30 minutes to complete one full turn or 1 hour to complete two turns with dinner included. Great views of the city, the harbor, Marina Bay Sands and the F1 Grandstands and pits. A fun time for all.",,,
,,WOW,5,,"we didn't make it this trip but have been before, and for someone scared of heights I was not scared one bit. The view is tremendous . well worth the money.. One for your bucket list....dont miss it.",,,
,,Amazing Views of Singapore,5,,"It's a bit touristy, but it's worth it for the view. Each pod can accommodate up to 30 people. Also, there is an iPad to get more information about Singapore as well as a pre-recorded commentary!",,,
,,Unique experience,5,,You get an bird view of Singapore and it's worth your money. We took it in day light to see all but it's open till late evenings as well.,,,
,,Extremely good view of the city,5,,"The flyer ride is for 30 minutes. You get a very good view of the city from the flyer. There is a nice information tab available in the flyer capsule, which gives you a brief idea of place to seen m/visit in Singapore.",,,
,,The best way to get views of Singapore!,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is one of the best ways to get amazing views over Singapore. It is a narrated journey that takes approximately 30 minutes. The narrator points out points of interest and landmarks as the wheel makes its journey around.

Do not miss this on your trip to Singapore!",,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,I did this for the first time and I was really surprised. The ride takes 30 minutes and you can enjoy a spectacular view to the city and the sea. It is next to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which seems out of a science fiction movie. Definitely recommended!,,,
,,Spectacular overall view of Singapore from this Singapore Eye,5,,Nice view of Singapore's other several landmarks from a 30 minute ride in this Flyer at a cost of S$33. The view before evening might be better for most of the viewers because the landmarks would appear clearer.,,,
,,A great activity.,4,,"Another must do in Singapore. The largest wheel in the world (I think) which is adjacent to the F1 track along the river. Prices are what you come to expect and the flight (as they call it) takes about 30 minutes and gives you some fantastic views over the city and beyond.

As with other must does in Singapore it is a bit out of the way and using public transport (eg the MRT and walking) can be a bit of a pain but if you have seen a Singapore gridlock you will praise the MRT.

If you a feeling a bit flush with cash it is possible to eat on the flyer and that means booking out a capsule. Indeed it has been used for a wedding party so noting is out of the question it would seem.",,,
,,Worth a visit,4,,Worth a visit . Singapore skyline in night backdrop looks stunning. Cabin is quite spacious . Preferably to go while its not raining n sky is clear .,,,
,,Singapore Ferris wheel,5,,The wheel is massive and the view is spectacular. The carriages were clean and spacious with plenty of areas to take photos.. Well worth the money for such wonderful views over Singapore..,,,
,,What a Night View,5,,"We came here like 3 times and just watching the Singapore from the top during night time with different lights was just awesome. Some get bored because it was not fast-pace but that was actually the beauty of it you observe, take a picture and admire the night lights.",,,
,,Beautiful and relaxed,5,,We rode Singapore flyer at night after our shopping . It was a beautiful colourful lights around Singapore . I think day time would be better to see more places . I would go there in day time next visit .,,,
,,A very expensive view of a concrete jungle.,1,,"1. The view don't really look interesting as there are so many brand new tall buildings. No character .... only very few pockets of interesting view - nostalgic ... the rest just uninspiring concrete jungle.
2. And because of the ""view"", the price is not worth it ...
3. I visited the place more than 7 years ago ... the option on when did you travel ... not applicable.",,,
,,The London Eye of Singapore,5,,"If you want amazing views of Marina Bay & beyond then climb aboard. We鈥檇 prebooked our trip but this isn鈥檛 always necessary. If you鈥檙e scared of heights then don鈥檛 panic. The wheel rotated so slowly you don鈥檛 feel scared by the height. There鈥檚 seating in the air conditioned large pod area. You access this via a well organised set up. As you set off, you firstly look over the F1 starting grid & garages. Fantastic views & landmarks to behold. Don鈥檛 miss it!",,,
,,Well worth doing,5,,"This is well worth doing. Superb, clean facility. Great view. Would be nice at night when Gardens by the Bay is lit up.",,,
,,To commercial for us,3,,A likely provides a great view but so will some top roofs of hotels. Not cheap and located on the F1 track. To be fair we did not take a ride but walked around.,,,
,,You can see forever,5,,"Pop this onto your ""must do"" list when you visit Singapore. The views were spectacular and the photos amazing. Try and get in early as it is less crowded. I just wish you could go around twice for the price as there was simply too much to see.",,,
,,A must at night,5,,Want an alternate view of the Singapore skyline and surrounds...get yourself on the Flyer at night for a spectacular light show. Will b visiting again,,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Its actually good place , singapore is very hot and humid. But they have built it very beautiful and attractive for tourists around the world.",,,
,,Go at dusk,4,,This is special but timing I believe is important . We went just on dusk and as the Flyer takes time as you get to the top you have the sensational vista of the Singapore skylight which includes Marina Bay Sands which is simply spectacular,,,
,,Good but without excitement,3,,It was good with lots of good views but it was not an exciting experience! You can take lots of nice pictures when you are in high height. Maximum height is 158m.,,,
,,Simply the best view of Singapore,5,,Awesome and do-able even for those that don鈥檛 like heights. This is a great adventure and an amazing way to view the city,,,
,,Decide the kind of Singapore you wan't to see before planning -Day or night,5,,"Stunning views of the city from the flyer. My suggestion would be to decide whether you would like to see the Singapore in day or night setting - I won't rate one above the other. Both have their own feels. Since we had already converted the night view from other places at height, we decided to go around 6.30 PM to get a feel of both day and night.
For someone who wants to enjoy both day and night, try to start your flight (that's what one circle of the flyer is called) at around 6.45-7PM. You'll get a good view of day and night setting.",,,
,,Beautiful view of the city.,4,,Great photo opportunities up there though the glass could use a quick polish between the visits. The wheel rotates relatively slow si there's plenty of time to enjoy the view.,,,
,,"$33 is the adult ticket cost, probably worth it.",4,,"This is one of those things that is 100% for the tourist. If you have taken the London eye in London, its a similar version of it. If not, read on. There are pods in which about 10 people are placed have a complete viewable glass so you can have 360-degree views. I personally would have skipped it but was with a group and was obligated to go through. Once I was up, I did enjoy the views but I did not feel the high price of entrance was justified. We, later on, went to the rooftop bar Lavie on Marina Bay Sands and the views from there are amazing if you wish to skip the flyer, go have a couple of drinks there and enjoy the views at your leisure.",,,
,,Place to be there in evening hours,4,,"Have a cup of coffee, snacks, get into this busy area and enjoy.. Nice ride on the giant wheel to get the great view of part of singapore. Advisable to take combo ticket for the wheel, city bus..",,,
,,Best way to spend your first evening in Singapore,5,,THe panoramas of city you can see of the city are amazing. They make memories of a lifetime. Do not miss it,,,
,,Singapore flyer and city tour,5,,"Singapore flyer one time visit if you鈥檙e in Singapore for the first time it is worth visiting you get a nice city view of Singapore and flyer actually goes really slow which takes about 40 miniutes to complete a round
Over all it鈥檚 a nice experience:)",,,
,,Nice view,5,,"Nice view of the city! The ride takes about 30 minutes. A bit pricey, but you get a nice view. Lots of info is being given in the wagon, but unfortunately i shared my wagon with a lot of chatting people..",,,
,,Great wheelchair service,3,,The staff were very obliging as we were travelling with our wheelchair bound grandson. Escorted us through a special way to avoid steps which ended up with us jumping the large queue (somewhat embarrassingly for us). No problem getting the wheelchair on and off. Interesting but short cycle around was over before you knew it.,,,
,,Excellent view,5,,"Singapore flyer is must to visit when you're in Singapore. Though, I have visited London Eye in Past but the outstanding view from Singapore flyer has no words to describe. One side you have sea view to look for and on the other side, one can see the buildings and lush green Gardens of the bay. Once you are on the top, it looks the equivalent to the sky deck of Marina Bay sands. It's worth of the money spent.",,,
,,WOW impressive view,5,,We did this on an afternoon when it was a little overcast but we still enjoyed our experience and the views,,,
,,A must for a Singapore visitor.,5,,"Like the London eye, it is an enthralling experience. It enables you to take in the 360 degree views of the city and the skyline.",,,
,,Cracking view,5,,"This is a big wheel, bigger than the London Eye, which takes about 30 minutes to provide you with great views of the Marina Bay area, city and sea - worth the ticket.",,,
,,Why not Miss this? OR shall I say NEVER MISS THIS,4,,"The proper meaning of Singapore Flyer is to have a same look as London Eye presents you but in very iconic and superlative manner. If this is not in Iteniery as Traveller with the groups than try to take out time of 2 hour and visit . This is something like you have been to Hotel but not Eaten a food. The place is so nice that you may not need to have any person with you.

For Old people more than 60 year of age, yes they are so happy because Flyer point reach has the Lift. And also the friendly nature of Employees staffs.

S$33 is so small fee to pay to experience one of the most iconic wheels or Wheel Observatories in world. As I remember in early 2000 only UK and Singapore were had the Flyers.",,,
,,Worth the money,4,,Thought the price for a ride on this was over the top but it was actually a great experience. Queues moved quickly.,,,
,,Just for the view,3,,"The night view that we got to see from the SF is enjoyable. You will be able to see both the city view and the ocean. Spacious and clean pods with benches to be sat on. Well organised on the queuing part.The pace is quite slow or i would say just nice. Pods can also be used for dining/ high tea prior booking.Apart from that, nothing is really like worth going over to experience it if you do not have extra time to visit other places .Tickets can be quite costly .Some food outlets on the ground floor to visit after the ride.",,,
,,Night Lights!,4,,"We went on this at night & the lights of the city were grand. I believe it was also less crowded during this time. If you can manage it, scoot to the end of the short nighttime line you might just get a private car!",,,
,,Love it!,5,,I just enjoyed the beautiful picturesque and great scenery while I was in Singapore and this is one of the places you must come see but beware there is lots of foot traffic here and very busy.,,,
,,A real Treat,5,,Loved this experience. Offered great views of Singapore & commentary whilst going around. There are 28 pods & each pod holds 28 guests although it was very quiet when we visited & we had a pod to ourselves. Very well run attraction.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,The only place to experience the entire city standing at one place. it is only one of the two flyer of the world,,,
,,A birds eye view of the Coastline and Skyline of Singapore City,4,,"One of the rides you 'should' be taking in Singapore. The 'Flyer' is to Singapore what the 'Eye' is to London.

It gives you a magnificent bird's eye view of both the Skyline and the Coastline of Singapore City.

Verdict : Go for a Ride to experience it.",,,
,,Best city view from round the clock,5,,The flyer is best place takes approx 45mins to complete ... you can see all key places from flyer Best place for kids to enjoy... flyer is fully A/C Awesome view of Singapore city,,,
,,Stunning & memorable views,5,,"Stunning views from the top with 360 degree views.

We had a great time with our family in the flyer. Do visit the flyer when the sky is clear.

I took 2 trips to flyer, one in the morning hours and other in the evening.

I personally enjoyed the morning hours view as I had already seen the Singapore at night hours from my flight :)",,,
,,Wonderful View at Night,4,,"I always curious to get in to this flyer, then finally I got the chance. So excited when queueing. I fly at night, the view was amazing. The city lights are so wonderful. I am a little bit fear of heights, so when it reached the highest point, I just can't stand on my feet . I don't know how the ambience if it's in daylight, maybe it will have more clear view around. If someone asks me, ""Do you want to go to the Singapore Flyer again?"", I would love to answer, ""No thanks. Once is enough."".
The accesibility is soooo easy, love it!",,,
,,A room with a view!,5,,We were unsure if this would be worthwhile but it definitely was. Easy access from hop on/off bus. Amazing views. Gives a greater understanding of Singapore city layout.,,,
,,Enjoyed the views,5,,It takes approximately 30 mins to complete the rotation and costs about $30. The weather was perfect for us with views for miles. We enjoyed spotting things we had seen on the ground.,,,
,,Third time lucky with flyer,4,,We took the mrt from rochor near little india to promenade mrt to reach the flyer . On first day we tried to club it with our visit to gbtb. But on that day due to inclement weather we were not allowed admission to flyer . second day again we went but again due to lightning and thunder guests were not allowed to ride the flyer . We did not give up and came back the same day evening and were third time lucky to enjoy the flyer . We were only five people in the capsule . The flyer moved at a very slow pace .Tthere was commentary for guests about flyer and singapore as we rode .As the ride starts moving up we get a 360 degree view of the city state. The day we went was bit overcast otherwise we could have got better views .The commentary will announce when you reach the peak i e a height of 165 metres .it is advisable to take the flyer at around 6.45pm to get a day night view .the view of gbtb and mbs from above is stunning .Remember if there is lightning no one will be allowed to enter the flyer .This is a must do if your are visiting singapore.,,,
,,Memorable views,5,,We selected the cocktail gondola which leaves at selected times. It costs more but you get a cocktail or mocktail to enjoy whilst you take in the sites. The best part is that hardly anyone does this. We have booked twice and on both occasions we were the only ones in the gondola so we had it all to ourselves! The gondola is decorated in Moet livery and makes for a fantastic opportunity to get your bearings and take some photos.,,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,Singapore flyer is amazing u can see the whole Singapore in one go. If possible plan ur visit according to marina bay light and fountain show. Could see far and wide really had fun.,,,
,,Good views from the flyer - expected a bit more,3,,"Good views from the top, however, I expected a bit more, which it seems was the original design. Like the holders for IPads which just have a carboard picture in them. The money could be better spent elsewhere if you are on a budget.",,,
,,Great fun for the whole family.,3,,"After a day at the zoo, we where walking around a decided to go on the flyer. We all enjoyed the ride and laughed as we circled Singapore. Great view of the track and Marina Bay. Not sure how much it was but it seemed like it went for 30 mins which was about right.",,,
,,Flyer,5,,Nice stout swing acc to my son.... but it was very slow ... rather very very slow acc to him ... actually kids wont enjoy it ... BUT for elders n the ones who love sceneries wud jus go mad for it ... i thoroughly loved it i m afraid of heights . ... but this thing the flyer dint let me feel my fear... the rite tym acc to me is to go by the dawn ... its jus amazing .... to see singapore from such height ... rather c lighted singapore... as if its celebrating diwali festival ...,,,
,,Beautiful View,5,,"I recommend go Singapore flyer say about 6.15 onward as is the sunset view it really blow your mind at that feel and the slow moment. Purchase ""Klook website"" from online is the best rate. Weekday won't be that crowds, so you can enjoy the moment.",,,
,,ONE OF SINGAPORES WONDERS!!,5,,"I brought my wife to this spectacular ride to view Singapore at it's best, the afternoon we came here there was no waiting to purchase tickets or get on the wheel this really surprised me as I had read how busy this can be! I guess we got lucky, and we wanted the best view of both times daytime and evening so we arrived just before sunset to get pictures before the lights came on and we timed it to perfection. I would suggest planning your visit this way because before we arrived at the pinnacle of the wheel we took some good pictures without the city lights just..... Then the city lights came on and it became a whole different setting and series of pictures, we had very good weather a clear sky of blue. The capsule we entered only had 12 people in it so it made for easy pictures without interruption.
we highly recommend this at Marina bay.",,,
,,Amazing views of the city at night,5,,"We chose to board the flyer at 9 PM so as to miss the crowds and be able to view the city lights at night.We were the only ones in the capsule which made it extra special.The view, which encompasses the city, Marina Bay Sands and Gardens By The Bay from 165 meters up, is amazing.Do not miss this experience!",,,
,,family visit,4,,"nice enjoyed with kids , guide helped us to take ticket, mornign time is good for best view, less rush in morning",,,
,,Stunning view at night,4,,"From here you can get a 360 view of Singapore which is specially stunning at night time. You can even catch the light show that happens on weekends nearby.However, people afraid of heights should stay away feom here.",,,
,,Highlight of our trip,5,,"This is a simply outstanding tourist attraction which is a must see. The 40 minutes ride gets you to see the whole of Singapore with a birds eye view. The view is simply breathtaking and makes one marvel at this structure.

Do not miss this once in a lifetime experience.",,,
,,Fun,5,,"Everyone must go on it super fun, great shopping inside and a bit weird to get to it but worth the fun. The best time is Chinese New Year as you get the public Chinese carnival.",,,
,,Excellent view,5,,"Singapore flyer is an excellent large wheel, gives spectacular view of Singapore. Everything is well organised and clean. Staff courteous. Once in a lifetime experience.",,,
,,Excellent view and vantage point,5,,"You get aa excellent view of the key landmarks and the Singapore sky line in all directions. The pods are spacious and airy. The pods move visiting very slowly and I could not always perceive the movement. We had pre-bought tickets, The time we went (approx. mid-day) there was not a long wait time. Defiantly recommend if you visit Singapore",,,
,,so high up!,4,,"Brought my fiance up on this for dinner. I loved the views, we are so high up! She freaked out and wasn't comfortable because we're so high up... Try it!",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,One of the best experiences... Must go for... The breath taking view and easy movement... Simply amazing,,,
,,Lost in fantasy - right at the top!,5,,"Beautiful! That鈥檚 just too humble to describe the experience. You have a giant wheel and once you step in, you have audio playing and talking about Singapore and the places. Evenings when the city is lit up is when I love going to the flyer. It鈥檚 fun watching the entire city! The sea shines bright and it鈥檚 best when there鈥檚 moonlight!

Don鈥檛 forget to get your family picture clicked!",,,
,,So Worthed !,5,,I've been to Singapore Flyer when I was still single on 2009. But now my trip to Singapore Flyer was with my little family : my kids (3 years old and 9 months baby) and wife. The Ticket price for adult was S$33 and S$21 for my 3 years old child and no ticket need for our baby. We were very exciting when we entered the capsule especially my 3 years old child. Very pleased because we can see all of Singapore from the capsule and now also a tab 360 degrees that gave us information what we were seeing. Comfortable in the capsule because we were just 6 people inside.,,,
,,WHAT A VIEW,4,,Superb view .. went in the morning. Singapore is so GREEN CLEAN and systematic. enjoyed the flyer.. would definitely try the night view next time.,,,
,,Amazing View,4,,You can see amazing view of city. The night view was really really amazing. You will feel like sky but the cost was higher too.,,,
,,The best view in town,5,,"A fantastic experience, would recommend at night, then again during the day it's that good. Easy to get to and affordable for families.",,,
,,You Have To Do It,5,,"Being afraid of heights and not willing to do the Melbourne Star in my hometown which is a mere 120metres high I bit the bullet while on holidays and faced my fear and went on this standing at 165metres high. Loved it, great views from all directions and felt completely safe. Arrived early which ensured we didn't have many people in the same pod who may freak out like I could off. If I did it you can.",,,
,,A tourist must see,4,,"Singapore is a quiet place. This is a large, quiet attraction. It is pleasant and clean. A good symbol for Singapore. Otherwise what can one say? It is tall. It is clean. It is safe. It has a great view. Do you really need anymore.",,,
,,Night View is the Best View,5,,"We waited until our last night in Singapore to hop on the flyer at about 8:30 or so and there was no line and we were able to get a whole capsule to ourselves which was great. That allowed us to take photos without someone in our view. You get great views of Singapore including Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay and Downtown area. The capsule itself has a bench in the middle and a lot of open space to maneuver around. It also has an informative video going inside that highlights what you are seeing as you go around and the entire flight is about 30 minutes and it goes by pretty fast. Definitely worth the visit.",,,
,,Flyer,5,,"I am scared of heights, but I just had to go on it. The view is incredible. You even have a chance to see the beautiful garden from up top. Awesome.",,,
,,Stunning views,5,,"Don't miss this experience. Cost per adult S$33 but well worth it. The Flyer stands165 metres high (42 storeys), with a diameter of 150 metres, the ride take about 30 minutes with views over the bay, the F1 race track, city and river.",,,
,,Nice,4,,"Very Accommodating staff,. thanks for the excellent service. Very Nice amenities as well as the ambience",,,
,,What a Facility,5,,"Excellent infrastructure and praiworthy management. London Eye is spread over a larger area but Singapore one is more compact and seems to be better planned. A ride gives one 360 degree view of the City State.
Observed that the Casules are spacious and rotation speed is very well calibrated keeping in view passenger's comfort & convenience.
A must go to place while in Singapore.",,,
,,Breathtaking Views of Singapore,5,,Rode the Flyer at night and experienced breathtaking 360 degree views of Singapore. The entire city was lit up. There is also a video guide inside each pod that highlights each visible district/area from the pod as you reach different heights of the ride. The entire ride itself lasts about 30 minutes.,,,
,,Lovely View,5,,Can enjoy the Singapore Skyline. Moves at a good place and also is spacious. You can see the F1 race track as well.,,,
,,Best view for a glass of Champagne,5,,We sipped champagne while on board the Singapore Flyer. The view was perfect! Might suck for someone with a fear of heights. Only complaint - one rotation of the wheel goes by pretty quick. It was just over 30 minutes but felt like 10.,,,
,,Great!,5,,"We had the whole capsule to ourselves! Great views, relaxing, air conditioned. It is pretty amazing, i highly recommend!",,,
,,So. Much. Fun.,5,,"If your trip allows, try to visit the Flyer early on a weekday day to avoid the crowds. I had the entire car to myself! It usually sits 28 people. Enjoying every view possible of this beautiful country was truly a treat!",,,
,,See the city from a good view,4,,"Great views of the city on this modern-day type Ferris wheel, very popular, average price (33SGD), we went late afternoon- not too busy then",,,
,,Great view,3,,"Went two times to the flyer,once at night time and once during the day,just to catch a glimpse of both the night and the day light view.
From the flyer we could see most of the attractions esp when we reach the top. For example, Gardens by the bay,MBS and many more.
I would highly recommend it to the first timers visiting SG as not only we could enjoy the great wide view of SG but also inside each compartment of the flyer,there is a small screen tablet where we could see and view the different places of SG and that tablet could be very helpful if you have still not decided on where to go next in SG.",,,
,,Awesome top view,4,,Wonderful ride to see Singapore and specially bay area. It is more so beautiful to take this ride in evening.,,,
,,day trip to Singapore Flyer,4,,"A day trip to Singapore Flyer from Larkin Sentral, Johor Bahru. Convenient and fun! Take Causeway Link, CW2 to Queen Street from Larkin Sentral. You need not worry of the traffic as buses have their own designated lane. Reach Queen Street, take Grab for a 4 minutes ride to Singapore Flyer. Singapore Flyer ride itself takes about 30 minutes. Enjoy lunch at Arab Street.",,,
,,Group visit,4,,beautiful view overlooking the promenade. The entrance to take the flyer the queue was orderly & organised.,,,
,,Rip off of the London Eye,3,,A monument in Singapore. The Flyer is a failure project and to what i heard ots losing money. If u wanna just go on a mega Ferris wheel simmilar to the london eye. Please do go. Try to go in between 6-7pm. Thats the best time.,,,
,,Beautiful...and Terrifying,4,,"The flyer will give you fantastic views of the city of Singapore, The night time views are particularly stunning. When you go in, you will go through the departure lounge etc as if you are going on a flight, it is a great experience...unless you are like me and terrified of heights, to be fair, I did not enjoy it one bit because if my fear of heights but everyone else in my party loved it, anyway, am glad I made the effort and had the experience, but I won't be repeating it.",,,
,,Majestic,5,,Feels very safe inside although the immense height. Very spacious and caters for many people inside. Informative presentation as well. Offers excellent views of the major sites in Singapore,,,
,,SINGAPORE SSIGHTS,5,,The Singgapore flyer is a spectacular ride! The capsules and large and comfortable - perfect for flying over Singapore with wonderful views of the city and surroundings Perfect vantage point to see all of Singapre spread out below.,,,
,,Wonderful views,5,,"Got a river taxi to the Singapore Flyer which dropped us off within easy walking distance. The views were amazing, a very memorable experience.",,,
,,Top of the World,5,,"A visit to Singapore is not complete without a ride on the flyer. This was my second visit to Singapore and both times we did the flyer and enjoyed the views and the ride. It is a must do. I will add that during our recent visit, there was almost no wait time to get on the flyer.",,,
,,One of the Better Flyers Out There,4,,"We have been to many Flyers around the world and this has to be one of the best. The capsule is large, fitting a max of 28 people. The loading staff were brilliant, only packing in a few into each pod, there was only 6 of us in our pod, so we had plenty of room to view from the windows.
Takes approx 30 miins for a full rotation, and the views from the top were simply stunning. If you are a F1 fan, you can work out the circuit which was very nice.",,,
,,One of the symbolic place of Singapore,5,,"You can go in the Singapore Flyer and spend some time. You have for it,but it is worth it. It is like spending to get the view of the town.",,,
,,Fantastic City Views,5,,"If you want to see Singapore in all it鈥檚 glory, then this has to be the way to do it. The 鈥榝light鈥?starts with a brief museum showing the history and development of the Flyer. You then have a photo taken, copies of which can be purchased at the gift shop, and then you board the gondola and the wheel really starts turning, slowly. As the huge wheel turns you slowly see more and more of the wonderful Singapore cityscape below you. It鈥檚 an incredible ride.",,,
,,Amazing views of Singapore,5,,The Singapore Flyer is a must do when you come to Singapore. I am not great with heights but because the flyer moves at a graceful pace you forget about how high you are until you have reached the top! If you are going in the day my advice is to go early before the crowds- but I can see that it would also be wonderful at night with all the lights. The flyer moves slow enough for you to not be scared if you are worried about heights but you can see so far it is really worth the time and effort.,,,
,,The best flyer take you up so slowly,5,,"Believe me you will not find it scary at all as it moves much slowly even you can not guest the movement. Singapore Flyer is one of the major things that make Singapore one of the top tourist destinations. It鈥檚 the tallest Ferris wheel in Asia which can hold 28 passengers in 28 air-conditioned capsules. Once in the wheel, you are bound to get the adrenaline rush of your life.

While you ride the giant flyer, you would be able to notice the city from the top of the wheel, i.e. from the height of 165 meters. The height of 165 meters, which could also be compared with a 45 storied building, offers you a spectacular view of the city below.",,,
,,Breathtaking Views....,5,,"One should reach singapore flyer at start of evening i.e. on meeting time of day and night (around 06:30-07:00 pm). We were there for around 06:45 PM and boarded the flight which was of 30 Minutes duration and views from top, were spectacular. Must Visit",,,
,,ecstatic view of the city and beyond!,4,,nice value for money. you can take a lot of pictures at ease since the flyer moves very slowly. even senior citizens can enjoy the place,,,
,,Way Up There,4,,Went at night time to view the city lights couldn't believe how large the gondolas are. Moved so slowly so you can see all the sights and not scary at all.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"Great views and comfortable ride鈥?informative and the little eateries and gardens are great also鈥?very clean, had my 70 year old Dad with us and he enjoyed it also鈥?
,,Merry Go Round!,4.0,,Up and down and circling around"," a must to enjoy since you can see the beautiful skyline of Singapore.""",,
,,A pretty nice view of the Singapore skyline.,4,,The Singapore Flyer looks well lit and attractive from flight.it's a nice ride with family and kids enjoying their time in the flyer.there is a nice view of the singapore Skyline.Nothing very exciting can give it a miss if your stay is short in Singapore.,,,
,,Boring,3,,Ok so if we comparing to London wheel then this is lacking. The capsules do not rotate and one simply goes along like a ferry wheel. Not the best way of visualising Singapore. Found this highly boring. Also be prepared for the queues.,,,
,,Really cool experience!,5,,"We did this in the late afternoon as the sun was starting to set, did not have to wait in a line at all & only had 5 people (including the 2 of us) in the whole capsule! It turned out to be the perfect time to go, as after sundown the line was ridiculously long & they were probably cramming each capsule with 15-25 people. The views were amazing & with so few of us in the capsule at that time, we got many great pics! If you want a view to see the city lights at night, I would highly recommend doing the Flyer during the day before sunset & then heading to the Sky view tower at the Marina Bay Sands at night, as it is even higher than the Flyer with better views, & much less of a crowd to deal with.",,,
,,Views of the area.,5,,The flyer offers views over the Marina area. Takes around 30 mins to complete a rotation. Great photo opportunities . Costs $32.00 per adult. Fully air con and nice ice cream shop near the ride.regards David B,,,
,,Better than expected,5,,"My friend suggested we go so I went. I am glad I did. The wheel turns at the right pace. Slow enough to enjoy seeing all of Singapore and not feel rushed, but not so slow you are checking your watch. Other than the high cost, highly recommended.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer - Must do,5,,Its a must when visiting Singapore. The views are incredible especially at Night. Absolutely awesome. No lines at ticket counter. Good experience.,,,
,,Singapore flyer.... breathtaking city view !,5,,"A must visit place , a bit expensive but it's experience thrills !! A good place to spend some memorable time with your loved ones.",,,
,,Same but Different,4,,"Even though there were ticket offices where we entered they were closed, we found it somewhat difficult to find the open one, but eventually did and bought our tickets with only a short wait. We found our way to the entry point (having a photo taken on the way) and I nervously got on, heights are not my thing, but as long as I'm looking out to the horizon I'm ok, looking down, is a definite no, no for me, needless to say I was able to sit for the entire time.
The entire experience takes about 30 minutes in complete air conditioned comfort.
The views are great and you can easily identify the sites.
When exiting you go through the obligatory gift shop and you are invited to view the photo taken earlier.
The surrounds are lovely with a beautiful rainforest feel, fish and food/drink shops.
I think the Singapore Flyer is worth a visit, even though the experience is the same as many others around the world, I think you need to appreciate the differences between each cities, the views are unique.
I would recommend doing this at night when you could appreciate the lights of Singapore.",,,
,,Best views from here,5,,"I went on this after my duck tours. It was really nice and comfortable place. and at the end of the ride, they give you a photo. Really nice experience.",,,
,,Well worth the ride,5,,"We were lucky to have a cabin to ourselves for the 30 minute trip. The views of Singapore were fantastic, with a good commentary running continuously. We appreciated the fact that the trip was slow, because it gave us time to look carefully over the whole city and Bay Area. Well worth doing, although shop carefully for tickets. We paid top price at the ticket box, not realising that we were entitled to discounts. (Should have read Trip Advisor first!)",,,
,,Sights of Singapore,5,,"Excellent views over Singapore, with a voice guide explaining where everything is.
The full rotation takes about 30 minutes, and there is plenty of time to take in the Marina Bay Area as well as the rest of the Singapore skyline.

Very well organised, and the cabins are very cool considering the climate outside.

Definitely would return and recommend",,,
,,High,5,,"In general, I am afraid of altitude, but this place seemed to me very safe despite the huge height. Fantastic top view.",,,
,,Decent View of Singapore City @ Night!!!,4,,"Went at night to explore the city view @ night. The overall view was good not that great as you can't see anything on the sea side, only exciting part is you get to see illuminated Trees of Garden by the Bay. Its a 30mins long activity. Albeit it is bigger than London Eye, i would still rate London eye higher as it provides a holistic view of whole London.
On the positive front, one get to see the well lit up city. See the photographs!!!",,,
,,A must visit,5,,"Really enjoyed the ride and would say it is a must do attraction when in Singapore, my son thought it was very neat being up high and seeing the city - took some amazing photos",,,
,,Singapore fromAbove,5,,"Typical of flyer found around the world, goes up to a maximum height of 165 mts, I could not find any option for booking tickets online, purchased the ticket there itself. Easily accessible by bus and MRT. I would suggest the night view, the city lights up and from a height the view looking stunning. A must do if you are in Singapore.",,,
,,Is it me or is it just not exciting enough?,3,,"I was lucky to be here at a bright and clear day, while there were just a few visitors.
The review at the entrance hall is very interesting (almost as ineresting as the view from the wheel), but could be much better with an interactive user experience.
The ride is slow enough to allow absorbing the scenery as well as taking as many pictures as one would like to (I was personally bored after 20 minutes of the 30 minutes ride).
It might be the most romantic date if you catch a ride at night with no others on the cabin.",,,
,,Champagne Flight - Worth It,5,,"Experience the flyer for the flyer, don't expect much view of Singapore. Your view is pretty much limited to sea on one side and Marina area and beyond on the other. We took the Champagne flight and luckily no one else joined us so we had the entire cabin to ourselves with chocolates and Moet hence my review may be biased as I haven't really done the stand in the Que and hop on flight. On the other hand if you are to book the Champagne flight try and time it in the evening and enjoy a sun downer up in the air with a breathtaking view !",,,
,,Great view,4,,"It was great to see Singapore landmarks and the city. But it doesn鈥?cover all sides of Singapore and it鈥檚 kind of boring if you are not into taking photos. I was lucky to be in a carriage myself as I went there alone, which made it enjoyable, loved the quiet time with view. Is it worth the cost though?",,,
,,Nice way to see the city,4,,Very spacious cabins. Nice way to start your holiday. Great to take the family with lovely photo opportunities. Nice and slow so you can really take all the sights in,,,
,,Dont Miss the Amazing View,4,,"If you are visiting Singapore do not miss to have the Amazing View from the flyer. If possible do visit this place during night time when can get an awesome view specially of the laser show at ""Garden by Bay"".",,,
,,Spectacular views,5,,"Visited midweek late afternoon, lucky to have a capsule ourselves! Spectacular views over the city, South China sea and gardens by the bay. Takes around 25 mins to go round. Looks amazing at night light up! If you have flown with Singapore airlines keep your boarding pass as you receive a discount.",,,
,,Excellent views,5,,This provides awesome views of the bay and city. Singapore has done a great job renovating the Bay Area to make it tourist friendly.,,,
,,Beautiful view,4,,you can see the view of the city beautifully here. it is somewhat expensive.but you can feel the sky and enjoy the flyer,,,
,,Great city views,5,,Kind of obvious thing to do really. Was well worth the cost though with great views of the bay and the city. I went in the afternoon when it was quiet and no queues. I think the evening is probably more spectacular given the neon lighting around the city but there is a lot to see in the day as well. I particularly liked seeing all the ships which you wouldn鈥檛 really see at night,,,
,,Best flyer on the world,5,,"We enjoyed this with full family . From this , we can see whole Singapore . Night view of Singapore was amazing .",,,
,,Feel the sky but with higher cost,3,,"Singapore flyer is good if u just wanna experience it otherwise many other places are also there to see the singapore from height like ion orchard mall on orchard road(free admission),sentosa cable car(paid but much lesser then flyer), tiger tower etc.
Singapore flyer gives u 15 to 30 min of round. Each capsule can equip 28 pax.
U can opt for dinner or drinks option in evenings which costs more.
Afternoons are usually empty which sometimes allows you to enjoy exclusivity in each capsule.",,,
,,Nice views,4,,We went during the day just as it started to lightly rain. It was still an interesting view of the surrounding area in a comfortable air conditioned setting. A nice respite from the heat. Note: be sure to purchase your tickets at ground level in the concessions area before you go up to the Flyer鈥檚 entrance.,,,
,,Nice view of Singapore skyline,5,,Absolutely nice night view of Singapore. Especially when the flyer brings you to the top. Skyline us very beautiful.,,,
,,Flying high,5,,"Like the EYE in London, the Singapore flyer is a must do ( apparently its taller than its counter part in London), if i remember correctly the entire cycle takes around for 30 minutes but the sight is to die for. The compartments are ac so enjoy the ride. Laze around the grass by the bay",,,
,,Wonderful views,5,,This slow moving wheel with enclosed capsules gives fantastic views over a wide area of Singapore. Thoroughly recommended as part of the tourist experience!,,,
,,Must see,5,,The Singapore Flyer offers a breathtaking view of the city albeit expensive! Long lines but still worth it. I would not recommend small children - no value to them.,,,
,,Slow and easy,3,,I've always been afraid of giant Ferris wheels but going on the Singapore Flyer is unlike any giant vertigo-inducing machine. The ride is slow and easy and offers good views of the Singapore coastline and also parts of Indonesia and Malaysia. There is also a screen that disburses information. An overall good experience that was slightly marred by little kids playing noisy games during the whole ride.,,,
,,Just Average,3,,"Singapore Flyer provides a breathtaking view from the top. Its is a bird's eye view of the whole of Singapore. The best time to visit is during dusk, this allows to have a view of the both the daylight and night views once the city lights come on. Only the time taken for a complete round is something that should be reduced. It takes approx. 45 mins for a complete round and one can admire the view for only so much time, after a while it gets boring.",,,
,,Fantastic Experience,5,,"Visited Singapore Flier with Family on a Sunday after booking tickets online..you can also buy tickets on the spot.. roughly 30 minutes ride, you don't feel the movement of your car..max height reached is 165 metres..what a panoramic view..you can see the harbour, ships , downtown Singapore with its skyscrapers, the bridges, river cruises etc...a must visit for a Tourist..",,,
,,A view from up on high,5,,A brilliant way to see the sights. As you slowly go round on the Flyer the vistas are amazing. You can see the Parks by the bay and the Flyer is on one corner of the Formula 1 racing track which you can still see even if the race has come and gone,,,
,,EXPERIENCE,5,,WOW what a day that was in the singapore flyper you can see almost the whole city and the top of the famous hotel MARINA BAY SANDS and after doing that during the exit time according to my opinion you should try the PLANE SIMULATOR PILOT EXPERIENCE only it is a little bit costly.,,,
,,A great way to see some of Singapore!,5,,We really enjoyed our ride on the Singapore Flyer. You get a great view and it's a smooth and well organised ride.,,,
,,a good way to get to see the city from on high,4,,this is quite expensive but does give you an impressive view of the city. try and go early to avoid the crowds and you may be lucky enough to get a pod to yourself.,,,
,,True signature of Singapore,5,,It鈥檚 the signature of Singapore which gives a vibrant and eye appealing looks to the place. When we visited it was suspended due to bad weather.,,,
,,ATTRACTION FULLY STOPPED DUE TO THUNDERSTORM AND HUGE QUEUE DUE TO GROUP OF TOURISTS...,3,,"In May 2018, I tried to access Singapore Flyer during an afternoon, but there was a huge queue already, due to several buses of Indian tourists coming at the same time. So, I had to wait 45 minutes in a very noisy queue... Suddenly, thunderstorm and lightnings appeared and attraction was stopped... I was then invited to come back later on the same day or within next days ! Due to the situation, I left and came back by night the same day. It was less queue and the view was somehow not too bad. But it is not exceptional I should say, I was even a little bit disappointed for the price paid. Better to do it by day, in a beautiful sunny day in order to take nice pictures of the city of Singapore.
I will soon add some photos for you to see what I'm talking about.

otterboris",,,
,,Engineering Marvel,5,,Though little costly for half hour experience but this is a marvel and worth going to see the landscape of Singapore. Try to go half hour before sunset and you can see city in both daylight and glowing at night time.,,,
,,Night ride on the flyer,5,,The view from the flyer is awesome It may take a little long but still a great way to see the city at night Maybe try to time it with the light show as Marina by the bay,,,
,,Great Service and View,5,,We did a Champagne Flight and had the carriage to ourselves which was great as they normally hold 30 people! Best time is 7.00pm to see the last of sunset. By the time your halfway around the lights in the city are on and it鈥檚 near dark when you get off. Friendly staff and well organized. The lounge is well priced and does a fantastic Singapore Sling and has nice cold beer! Great viewing of Marina Bay Sands and Gardens By The Bay from the lounge. Amazing views across Singapore from the wheel. Highly highly recommend.,,,
,,Good views but a bit expensive,3,,"Better to visit after sunset to get good nightlights views, but photos are better during day time. Expensive at $33 per ticket, especially unlike the London eye, the good views are only on one side of the Singapore flyer.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Its about a 30 minute round with a very good views, we can see all the towers, gardens by the bay etc. The views are really great !",,,
,,SNOREFEST,2,,"you get a view of the city and on a clear day, a distance into the heartland of the island. but it is not a spectacular view. it's cheaper and takes a lot less time than this very slow moving ferris wheel if you simply google the pictures. i wouldnt waste my time doing this again.",,,
,,Great view,5,,Love the ferris wheel....manage to see Indonesia went i visited. Sky was clear and the view was magnificent.,,,
,,Crystal clear view of singapore,3,,Singapore knows how to sell itself. Its a good experience to get a look at the main attractions of Singapore.,,,
,,Yes Yes Yes,4,,"Amazing ride on the flyer, the view is amazing, though if it rains and there are thunder storms they will shut the flyer down for safety reasons, so if it happens to be raining, go another day.",,,
,,High flyer,5,,"Just come back from the Singapore flyer, very good views , walk straight on to the pods , given one pod for our family to enjoy the views, makes it very personal, 165 meters high , very good photos from all windows, we had 4,3, year olds plus 21month old , all enjoyed it immensely, took 30 minuets to complete. Afterward we had a great walk along the water edge, with plenty of facilities for every body.",,,
,,What a view,4,,"You get spectacular view of Singapore from this giant wheel鈽猴笍

It revolves very slowly so no need to worry ... all age group can have a ride.

If weather spoils the ride we can鈥檛 do anything they will stop and make us to get down. No refund can be expected.",,,
,,Awesome experience!,5,,A ride on the Singapore flyer is an awesome experience. You can get a fabulous view of the city. The staff are courteous and helpful and the Flyer itself is a memorable experience for people of all ages.,,,
,,Lucky Timing,4,,"the day we visited the Singapore flyer the flights were suspended when we arrived due to the weather, but just as we were about to leave we noticed people getting on the pods above our heads and went to the ticket office and got on the flyer in a POD all by ourselves and just before the ticket sales were suspended again. the views of the city were amazing and the amount of shipping out on the straits were remarkable well worth the trek i do believe",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"Hi everyone, about Singapore Flyer I want to say that best time to enjoy Singapore Flyer ride is in evening time near to sunset or post sunset as at that time Singapore city looks very beautiful from up there ..one can have a full view of almost entire city from there. Cost per person is around 35 SGD. Kids up to 5 years are free.",,,
,,Flying High.. 360 degree view.. Breathtaking experience!,5,,"We visited Singapore Flyer in May 2018.

Tickets - Tickets can be purchased online from their website in advance or from the ticket counter. We purchased it from the ticket counter, queue was manageable.

Experience - Its a wonderful experience, flying over the city, viewing the major attractions of the city with a bird's eye.

Staff - Is extremely helpful and courteous.

It moves extremely slowly, suitable for kids / senior citizens.

Overall, an awesome experience! A must visit.",,,
,,Scenic View,5,,"If u want to spend a good evening with your loved one along with a view of Singapore, this is a best place to visit. Visit around 6-7 pm because you will get both views- light and darker",,,
,,Weekend outing,3,,Location was slightly away from Marina Shopping mall but easy walkways to the Flyer. Walking in morning or late afternoon is good. The ride takes about 30 mins. And No toilet in the capsule. Do your things before the ride. AmaZing view of Singapore .,,,
,,Great Views,5,,"Overcast day but that didn't dampen the enthusiasm or the view. A long wait in the queue to get on board and hereded a bit like sheep. That may have just been our timing in getting there as there was a lot of tourist buses when we got there. But once you get going the view is not disappointing. Would be superb at night. We followed that with a Dim Sum lunch in a very nice restaurant at the site. Great service and great food. Followed that with the fish foot spa, also available at this site. A must have if you don't mind having your feet touched. We followed this by having a massage each as well. Great value for money and a great 4 hours spent there.",,,
,,Quiet way to view the City,4,,"We pulled into the Singapore Flyer bus stop on the City Sightseeing bus and noticed that it looked really quiet so decided to use out pass for entry into the Flyer.

We arrived at about 10.30 on Sunday and the attraction was very quiet so ended up with just 4 other people in the carriage with us.

A great way to see some fantastic views of the City and the carriage plays a video with some great facts whilst you're travelling around. The trip takes approximately 30 minutes.

You can also have a private meal in the carriage, which is approx $240 - which is quite cheap considering a decent 2 course meal with a drink will cost you approx. $150 in Singapore and the Flyer costs approx $60 for 2 people. Something we wish we had done.",,,
,,Its kinda boring,3,,"I got the tickets for free, so we went flyers at around 8pm. Not sure how much actual ticket cost. The ride was around 40mins i think, the view is nice but like boring. Its not worth it if it cost above $20 per pax",,,
,,Flyer in rain,3,,It was raining when we took the flyer. They stopped the flyer after our round due to heavy rain. Not really impressed due to the rain.,,,
,,superb,5,,new experince must visit whole singapore view from flyer must visit very quick visit 165 meter height,,,
,,Huge!!!,4,,"Best time to visit would be at sundown, but I went during the day. this construction is amazing. I do not like hights but did not feel at all unsure at the top as the build is so strong. What a stunning view 360 degrees. A little expensive for 30 minutes but I felt it was worth the experience",,,
,,Singapore Flyer...high flying.,5,,"We visited and took a ride in the famed Singapore Flyer
it was a enjoyable and memorable trip.
Touted as the world's largest/highest flyer....Singapore Flyer is a must do attraction in the Island city.
A very slow ascent takes you to the very top totally unawares that you are riding/flying so high.
The wheel takes approximately 30 minutes to complete the rotation.
Good experience with amazing views .
Must try.",,,
,,Expensive,3,,"This attraction is strictly passable in my opinion. It provides a view of the Singapore skyline, the Gardens by the bay, a part of the Harbour. No great shakes overall.",,,
,,EXCELLENT,5,,If you want to see Singapore from top with 360 view get a ticket in flyer enjoy the trip take and hour for the full round you get to see garden by the bay marina sand bay with awesome view and good for picture also,,,
,,What a view!,5,,The Singapore Flyer is the Asia's Largest Giant wheel. You can see the complete Singapore and also locate the Malaysian and Indonesian boundaries. The movement of the wheel is very slow and are very safe for all ages. The best time to do it is at night when you can see the complete panorama of the Singapore skyline.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"I had bought an online ticket for the flyer on a specified date but unfortunately due to bad weather and storm in India my flight was delayed, i got again a ticket for Singapore two days later. I immediately from the airport itself wrote a mail to Singapore Flyer website mail ID requesting them to postpone my tickets. Although their policy says no cancellations etc. I m so grateful for them to understand it was a genuine reason as 100s of flights were cancelled that particular day. Now regarding the Flyer experience, it was a relatively long queue on a Friday but the line moved very fast, within few minutes we were inside. Although i do have a little bit fear of heights, it was not uncomfortable at all, and we had a great time clicking photos and enjoying the all round views. It was an awesome experience.",,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,The Singapore Flyer is an amazing experience where you get to see the entire skyline. The best time to take the ride is around 7:30 pm because you can see the lights show of the 鈥淕ardens of the Bay鈥?@ 7:40 pm as well the show in front of 鈥淢arina Bay Sands鈥?@8:00 pm from mid air. The total time for the ride is 40-45 mins.,,,
,,well worth the visit,4,,If in Singapore you should take a ride in this Wheel. Views are spectacular. Entrance is well setup and staff very friendly.,,,
,,"Amazing views, great piece of engineering",5,,"Thoroughly enjoyed this engineering masterpiece. Magnificent views and the kids absolutely loved it. We were on a cloudy Sunday and had hardly any queue and we had the cart to the 4 of us. Easily reached by MRT, a 5-10 minute walk will bring you to the main entrance. Nice ice cream and cafes downstairs.",,,
,,Great views of the entire city,5,,Fun experience. Views on all direction. A great way to spend 30 minutes to see the entire town. Worth every penny!,,,
,,Slow but interesting bird's eye view,3,,"We went there in the night around 7, there are lot of informative sections on the way up to Flyer to give lot of knowledge which needs some time to go through. Flyer itself was interesting but very slow moving. The visuals on TV in the flyer about the height was interesting. We could see the Super Tree light show from the top. Otherwise very uneventful. Maybe better in the daylight.",,,
,,Its time for ya,3,,"Seems costly to be an attraction,.....honestly...nothing really good for u to see...u rather spend some money and go up to MBS top garden....",,,
,,Nice view but otherwise dull,3,,After five mins you start wondering how much longer it will take. Nice view but it's slow and uneventful,,,
,,A great and unique experience,5,,"The Flyer is a must whenever in Singapore. One can see the panoramic view of the city in 360 degrees. You will never feel that the capsule is moving. If you are afraid of heights, you may still enjoy this attraction.",,,
,,Flyer - Singapore鈥檚 birds eye,4,,"Wonderful slow moving merry go around with view of the Singapore important places, enjoy with lights in the night for more fun and stunning view",,,
,,What an experience!,5,,Being up high on the singapore Flyer and drinking champane was an exciting experience. It cost a bit more than the normal tickets but very worth it. Every couple on holiday should try.,,,
,,Pre Cruise Stay,5,,An excellent place to visit for some spectacular views of Singapore. Reasonably priced and at this time of the year had no queues. Good for photography.,,,
,,Nice view of the city,4,,It is quite similar to London eye. Nice views of the entire city. We鈥檙e comfortable carrying an infant also.,,,
,,A 360掳 view of Singapore,5,,The Singapore Flyer is one experience that no tourist should miss. This observation wheel allows a 360掳 birds eye view of Singapores landscape The moment you get nto the capsule which accomodates 28 people and takes about 30 mins to complete a circle one gets to see Singapore endlessly.,,,
,,Get a bird's eye view of Singapore,5,,"I recommend doing this early in you visit. The wheel moves very slowly and gives you a 360 degree of Singapore and its layout and its harbor, The cars are air conditioned. It moves so slowly you can walk on and off the attraction while it is moving.",,,
,,Horrible customer service,1,,"I have been mislead by their website & purchased 3 tickets for me & my friends to ride the flyer tonight. I incorrectly purchased a local ticket. I was happy to pay the difference for a full ticket however they refused to allow this. Their answer was to fill out a customer feedback form??? Strongly suggest you give this attraction a miss, got great photos from MBS & other great Singapore attractions",,,
,,Good flyer,4,,Singapore flyer is a very good place to visit and view from the height looks very good it move very slowly so no need to scare,,,
,,Bird eye view of Singapore,5,,Singapore flyer was an unique experience for me as well as for my family. It is bird eye view of Singapore. A safe ride of 30 minutes . Must do,,,
,,Great Views,5,,"Is a good way to see the sights, a slow 30 minute ride gave time to take lots of video. Great views over the city, a little bit smokey from fires on neighbouring islands. Good roomy cabins. Our second time on a big ferris wheel, 1st time was the Melbourne Star",,,
,,Big wheels,5,,Truly a big wheel that can see the night city of Singapore. Recommended to those who has an hour to come.,,,
,,A little pricey,3,,"Disappointingly, we found that a standard ticket is priced at 33 SGD for an adult so we were put off from visiting. As much as the Flyer looks amazing lit up at night and appears to offer excellent views of Singapore City, other Skyline views can be experienced for far less of the cost e.g. Marina Sands Bay Hotel observation deck. Perhaps they鈥檙e targeting the ferris wheel at family groups, it is rather strange to see a big wheel alongside such a masterful and impressive building like the Hotel.",,,
,,Awesome view of Singapore,5,,One of the best place to visit ... Whole view of Singapore at its best ... 30 min round ... Splendid view of surrounding ... Must visit place,,,
,,Go during daylight,3,,"After going to the Marina Bay Sands observation deck, this seemed less stunning. Also, the views at night were not as clear through the glass, so going during the day would probably be better.",,,
,,Great views specially around the F1 race,5,,Highly recommented specially when the F1 is in town. You get amazing view over Singapore and the track well worth the money.,,,
,,Picturesque!,4,,"Both Marina Bay Sands Skypark and Singapore Flyer offers entire City view. But if have a choice, select Sands Skypark Observation Deck View than Singapore Flyer. The very reason - this one is located on 56 level which is higher than the height of Singapore Flyer. If you chose both if money is not the problem.
Please look at weather forecast before you chose Sands Sky park as Singapore Flyer still works during moderate rains but Sands Sky park can be closed or you may not enjoy the city view during the rain.",,,
,,Terrific,5,,This is an excellent way to see The layout of Singapore. Travels slowly so that you can take it all in. We shared a pod with a lovely local family which added greatly to the experience,,,
,,Loved this,5,,I was a little worried about this due to my aversion to heights but I am so glad we went on this. The first visit it was closed for a while due to an impending storm so we decided to leave it for another day. Next morning was clear and sunny so we arrived at 9.15am and got straight on but when we came off we noticed all the tourist buses arriving. It goes very slowly which made it much more enjoyable for me. Fabulous views and many photos taken. Next time we will go on it in the evening.,,,
,,First day in Singapore,5,,"great experience, no waiting, all went smooth and lovely half hour flight, attendants all very nice and helpful",,,
,,Best easy way to see the city without moving,5,,"The flyer moves you so you just take in the views without the effort of moving around. It offers viewers the sea, city scenes and lights when the sun sets and evening draws near. Incredible sunsets over the city make the trip memorable but you got to get the timing right.",,,
,,"Great Place, lot of fun!",5,,We had a lot off un in the Flyer. My daughter who is 5 years old loved it! We could see the whole Singapore from the top and could see the garden as well.,,,
,,Best at night,5,,Best to go at night with your girlfriend or boyfriend. Take photo. place for romantic dating. You can view of marina bay sands.,,,
,,Rather go top the Tampa Bay,4,,It's good but I think people will stop going there as the Tampa bay hotel gives a better view now and is higher as well,,,
,,Just like London,4,,"It's the same as the one in London, only less crowded. Expensive but thrilling. One can see the harbour, gardens by the bay, and parts of the city. Definitely ride if u haven't done the London one.",,,
,,Escape holiday,4,,Out from my business routine in Singapore and was enjoyable to visit this place. Very relaxing and kill my stress. Nice concept for holidays and good value.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"We rode this in the evening. It was quiet when we went and we shared a booth with only 2 other people. Great views of Singapore. Worth the cost, about 拢10 each. Takes roughly 30 minutes to get round.",,,
,,20 mins time pass,5,,"sit relax enjoy the skyline of Singapore, and coast area. take pictures. important attraction to see in singapore",,,
,,Amazing bird eye view especially in the day time,5,,"Its duration is only 15 minutes, but you will feel it is more than enough to enjoy the city view. You can also enjoy it during the sundown.",,,
,,Fantastic. Must do...,4,,This is a definite 鈥榤ust鈥?when visiting Singapore. The views are outstanding and the actual cabins are very roomy with plenty of space to walk around and take advantage of the various aspects. Great photo opportunities. Highly recommend.,,,
,,Such an awesome view!,5,,"Now the world's second-tallest ferris wheel, the Singapore flyer boasts an unrivalled view over the city's skyline.

The ride doesn't actually stop to take-on passengers, constantly spinning at a slow pace and this allows you sufficient time to take in and enjoy the breathtaking view from the very bottom all the way to the 165m apex and back down again.

I really enjoyed this attraction and next time would like to go for a ride during the night.",,,
,,Must do,5,,Did this on my first day. Found it very well organised and took about 45 mins to complete. The ease and grace viewing the island was simply mind boggling.,,,
,,Get the Singapore Sling!,5,,"We did the flyer with the Singapore sling and it was great! We got a shorter line, a drink, and no one else was in our gondola! It was so nice to not be crammed in like cattle and the wait was much shorter. Either way the view is great, especially at night.",,,
,,Worth the experience,4,,"Great experience, must do on your visit to Singapore
The portals are pretty roomy ,they give people in a group preference, all members will get 1 cabin
The cabins are completely glass ,so you get an all round view of Singapore city
The view is awesome, Marina bay sands ,river ,gardens by the bay ,cloud forest ,adjoining 5 star hotels ,the entire Singapore city lit up at night
Get some really awesome photos and memories
Supposedly this is much bigger than the London eye
We managed to catch the moonlight show at gardens by the bay from the flyer as we were in the flyer after 7 pm ,it was one pretty sight ,so if possible manage it that way
Worth a visit for the views and experience
Some recommend it just at the time of the setting Sun so you get a view of the city both during the day and night
The whole experience lasts 30 minutes",,,
,,360 degrees of WOW,5,,Well done Singapore. The Singapore Flyer is great. Panoramic views in all directions. It tops out at 165 metres above sea level. It rotates very slowly and is very comfortable. Miss this and you miss out.,,,
,,What a view,5,,"I am not a heights person, but you have to do a loop. Wonderful views of the Bay and surrounding areas. A recommended must for you tour.",,,
,,Worth a visit!,5,,Had a great time on here. I think it was 45 minutes total. Got one for our family with nobody else so we were pleased with that. Helped us decide what else we wanted to visit. Bradley Witham,,,
,,Beautiful view!!,5,,Very nice place to visit!! Worth yr money cause you can view the Singapore city from the top. Best to visit during the sunny day! Highly recommended!,,,
,,Best Flyer,5,,"The best glycerin the world which is airconditioned and gives a spectacular view of Singapore marina bay. Since it is enclosed and since it takes 28 mins to complete one revolution and don't even feel like its moving, so people who are afraid of heights can easily ride on it. It's very colorful at night with different led lights",,,
,,Must Visit Place in singapore,5,,"This another not to be missed area.Singapore Flyer, it basically capsule which takes 30 mins to complete the overall rotation and in the lift you will able to learn new attraction place of Singapore. you can also book the tickets from Klook or any other website. This activity is in the same area of Gardensby the bay , Marine Bay Sands hotel and Merlion park of singapore., .",,,
,,Welcome to Singapore,4,,This flyer shows how developed Singapore is. So clean and balanced between development and maintaining the city,,,
,,A must visit in Singapore,5,,The flyer is one of the most attractive thing in Singapore to visit. It's a totally different experience to view the city from the flyer.,,,
,,Skyscrapers,5,,Amazing Tall Skyscraper and River side.. Lights up in the night and a river cruise makes it more attractive,,,
,,Worthwhile visit,5,,Although this mimics a few other flyers in other countries this one is wonderful as you get a fantastic view of the city Well worth the visit,,,
,,Good views of city and marina.,4,,An enjoyable view of Singapore and the Marina. However it is very tourist orientated and thus lots of souveniers and photo taking stations to try and upsell to patrons.,,,
,,Experience one shouldn't miss,5,,"When friends suggested Singapore Flyer we were a little skeptical on the heights and how fast it may move but all our questions were put to silence when we reached the place.

Like Gandolas and Cable cars the Cubicle moves in very slow but sturdy phase for one to get in. The authorities gets in and cleans all the cubicles first and then lets us in. Not more than 8 or 9 is let in inside a Cabin which is around 25 feet by 10 feet with clear glasses all around with very neat air conditioning and seats in the centre so one can enjoy the panaromic view. This one being the biggest in Asia gives you a panaromic view of entire Singapore island and beyond from one side and sea view from other wide where you can see islands of Indonesia.",,,
,,Dazzling City,5,,"Magnifiscent view if the city from the eheel. Very well planned city. Enjoyed orchid garden, bird park, Sentosa Island..",,,
,,Cracking,5,,Well worth doing you can see so much from it also as the F1 track is right there you can go and look at that too at no extra charge obviously not on grand prix weekend but any other time.beautiful sights and a must if in Singapore.,,,
,,A ride with a view,3,,"This is arguably the best view you'll have.
Prices is kinda hefty, but worth it.
I went on a weekday in the evening on one of the last spins of the wheel as crowds during the day can be quite massive.

I shared the cabin with only 6 other passengers (all young couples) and the ride was quiet enough to contemplate. In addition to the quiet ride everyone was able to take pictures from each angle as no crowds were in your way. The view at night is just stunning and provably more impressive, for sure more romantic, than during the day.

If you have time I can only recommend to go on a weekday's evening ride.",,,
,,If you've done London this one is bigger,4,,"Anything that has height will provide a good view of the sights, see all the intricacies of the different building shapes and styles vying for space. For fans of F1 see part of the Grand Prix circuit below you. There will be some similarity between the views from the Flyer and those from the viewing deck of Marina Bay Sands but well worth doing both to get different perspectives",,,
,,Interesting,4,,The view was ok. I prefer the amazing view you get when you go on the London Eye. But it's a good ride.,,,
,,A higher view of Singapore,5,,A must see if you are in Singapore with family or in a group and have a few laid back hours to yourself. Try to get on it in the evenings for both sunset and Singapore in its lit-up beauty.,,,
,,Like London but even more boring,3,,"I feel an almost compulsive need to give some of these tourist traps a visit but invariably end up feeling the same way...considerably lighter in the wallet and bored after the first few minutes.
In my opinion Singapore has a lot less of any interest to look at than you see on the London Eye, you take a load of photographs on the way up and spend the rest of the time hoping it is not going to seem to take quite so long to get you back down and away to the nearest bar for a beer.
I think I am just totally jaded with Singapore which nowadays has all the charm and appeal of a tin of baked beans.",,,
,,An evening well spent,4,,I would highly recommend to book the tickets by taking evening slot when the sun is setting and the whole Singapore starts lighting up.,,,
,,Something to do at night,4,,A 32 mins ride highlighting the beauty of the bay. recommend on a night ride that you can see the lights. Not the best clarity on raining days and the window need to be cleaned for better photos.,,,
,,Best at night,5,,"Weather permitting, if you can go at night, do so. The city lights are amazing from the top of the Flyer. My wife and I were very glad we included this attraction in our ""must-do"" list.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Great views over Singapore from the capsule, it was quiet when we took our trip, so no queues and plenty of space to move round the capsule for some great photos.",,,
,,View The City,5,,"It will take half-an-hour for one round, you can take nice pictures from the flier while rotating, the ticket cost S$33 per adult",,,
,,Must See at least Once,5,,It鈥檚 one of those things you should definitely do once. Great views of the City it鈥檚 a slow moving ride takes about 30mins ample time to take pictures and take in the Views we went early it wasn鈥檛 very busy got the box to ourselves which was great my kids loved it.,,,
,,"Wow, what a view!",5,,"A must do activity while in Singapore. We went on a Saturday night and had to queue for a short time after we purchased our tickets. Our capsule had about 12 poeple onboard which was comfortable. Amazing views of Singapore at night, you can't beat it.",,,
,,Longest Yard,4,,If you want to see Singapore city in one go..This is where you need to hop on...Looks beautiful in the night..,,,
,,Singapore Flyer.,5,,Very similar to the London Eye and provides super views over the city. Probably best visited in the evening when the city is lit up.,,,
,,A wonderful way to see Singapore,5,,The flyer is huge and provides fantastic views of Singapore. It takes a while to get around but it鈥檚 worth taking the time out to do it,,,
,,Amazing view.,5,,"You can go there by step around the Marina Bay or you can take a bus or by metro. From the top of the flyer you can see the Marina Bay and Marina Gardens, The Merlion and Sentosa Island. You can take a coffee or flying lessons or looking to the beautiful water all around you. You would have a great time.",,,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,"There are wonderful views to be had from The Singapore Flyer. I went on dusk, and had both day and night views in the half hour it took for a complete circle of the Flyer.",,,
,,Wonderful,5,,It gives beautiful view of Singapore. The Marina Bay view from flyer is very nice. The complete feeling and experience of flyer was really good.,,,
,,Best way to make a memory of Singapore,5,,"A must visit in Singapore, this herculean ride gives you a way to look at the country from a height that would normally make you dizzy but as you are encapsulated in a small room all you feel is the awe and wonder. This ride moves very slowly and takes around 30 min to complete the revolution which is enough times to click photos of the Singapore shore line, beautiful buildings including Marina Bay sands.
Dont miss it!!",,,
,,Great view,4,,We did the tour at afternoon and its very hot . its good view you can see all view of Singapore like Marina bay sand.,,,
,,Excellent experience,5,,"Was a little concerned at the thought of travelling so high up but the stunning views of Singapore were well worth the visit. Amazing, well worth a visit.",,,
,,Great,5,,Did this at night time which was fantastic. Great to see all the different coloured lights from the different.,,,
,,Great view,5,,Singapore flyer is beautifully constructed and very safe too. Slowly slowly as we reached at the top we find a great and amazing view of the whole Singapore. It is one of the great attraction for the tourist.,,,
,,A big wheel you never forget,4,,This iconic wheel is so fantastic to explore during the night. You will be impressed by the lights and views,,,
,,"涓€浜轰竴鐐瑰績锛岀ぞ浼氭洿娓╅Θ A little from all, together it's more",4,,"I have been to the Singapore Flyer on few occasions when my company has the corporate card. I remember one time with my mother and another time with my mother in law. But this time, I was a befriender for a Community project titled `Project CARE' accompanying elderlies from the various old aged homes for a day outing at the Singapore Flyer.

We had our sumptuous lunch at Ban Heng Restaurant before we proceeded to the Singapore Flyer. It was a meaningful outing hosting 520 elderlies across the island from the various old aged homes to enjoy rides at the Singapore Flyer.

Thanks to Singapore Flyer who sponsored the rides that would otherwise cost $33/- for an adult. The seniors were gleaming with smiles as they looked out from the capsules appreciating the stunning beautiful panoramic view of the island.

The staff of the Singapore Flyer were very helpful getting chairs for the seniors who were struggling with their quad walking sticks and having to queue their way to the boarding platform.

It was time well spent and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Singapore Flyer for their great corporate gift to our senior citizens. 涓€浜轰竴鐐瑰績锛岀ぞ浼氭洿娓╅Θ A little from all, together it's more!",,,
,,Nice but not awesome,4,,"If you have ever sat on giant wheel before you can skip it. It is same like London eye in London city , concord in Paris etc .
But if it is your first time then please go ahead with it , you will enjoy it thoroughly.",,,
,,A must-see in Singapore,4,,We went to see sunset over Singapore. We were lucky just to have two other people sharing a car so we had lots of space to look around the sights of Singapore. The cycle takes 45 minutes. I think we were lucky with the timing as when we finished there was a large queue so I'd imagine the cars can get quite busy depending on what time you go.,,,
,,Great views,4,,"Didnt have a long waiting time, we visited on a Monday around lunch time. Not too many in a pod so space to move around (apart from annoying children running around constantly, not the place for it so please be considerate to other people in the pod). Goes very slowly around so plenty of time to take lots of photos. No hints around the sides to tell you what you can see though so its kind of a guessing game. Thought it was a bit expensive for what it is but my other half pointed out its on par with the London Eye and no where near as long a wait! Has to be done...but just the once.",,,
,,Best place to visit cityscape,4,,"Singapore is the one of the cleanest city in Asia and sourrended by latest technology.
This tower almost 10 years old and beautifully designed. Ticket cost round 33 Singaporean dollars
I think you will get a better view in night. You can spend 30mintues to 1 hour there.",,,
,,Fantastic view at night from the top of the flyer,5,,Really worth a visit to see Singapore. We went at night and the city light were amazing and the que was very short.,,,
,,Best place to be at...,5,,"I think you should try this for sure, especially when u are at the top you get the entire view of Singapore. It's a hugh capsule...",,,
,,Best place in Singapore,5,,A memorable ride of flyer. From the top of the wheel you can view entire Singapore. It looks like a fairy tale scene. What a mesmerizing development.,,,
,,Night Photos not posisble due to reflections from lights on the flyer,3,,"Very disappointing experience mainly because I could not take city views in the night. Flyer itself is ok and you may enjoy the city views visually but could not take photos without reflections through glass panels...originating from the lights glowing outside the flyer. So, if you are mainly expecting to shoot some nice night shots, you will be disappointed.

May be, day time (early morning 8.30am) would be better for photos but night-shots have its own beauty which is not possible.",,,
,,"Very Expensive, Not Exciting",2,,"This was an obligatory tourist attraction for me on my stay in Singapore. I am willing to overpay for lots of things to try them once, but this was not worth it. At $33 per person you get to ride the extremely slow ferris wheel for about half an hour. Best part was when it was over. There are some good views when you get to the top of the ride, but you can get similar views with better angles for much cheaper in other parts of the city. Thankfully I did not have to wait in a long queue to board or I would have been really unhappy with the wasted time. Spend your money on some other funner things in the city.",,,
,,Nice adventure,5,,Very nice way to see Singapore from the heights. Very good views and very well organised. Would recommend this as a must do on a trip to Singapore,,,
,,A signal trade mark fro Spore,5,,"Visible from any side you approach the Singapore , by land, by Sea or by Air, is a significant recognised point for Singapore particular at the night",,,
,,Very bad experience,1,,Bad attitude of staff members....ride was so so and pricey...waste of money....not a place for tourists,,,
,,Smooth sailing and great views,5,,"Easy to locate, purchase ticket etc. Nice and slow going around so plenty of opportunities for photos. I鈥檓 not great with heights but this was no problem to me. Singapore is always changing so I would do it again if I鈥檓 back there.",,,
,,Aerial view of singapore,3,,An expensive ride but once is good. We had the cabin to ourselves so it was good. A slow and steady ride.,,,
,,nothing like the london eye,3,,"Getting on the Singapore Flyer with a partner for a romantic sight-seeing activity is worth the 37 minutes. However, if you're merely expecting an enjoyable ride with family or friends, the Singapore Flyer is clearly not for you.

To be fair, you do get a clear bird's-eye view from the capsule, as promised. Unfortunately, everything else was satisfactory. The queue dragged metres long and the customer service provided was not up to expectations. Attendants were sparsely stationed. The ultimate drawback was definitely the sluggish flyer itself.Its just too slow!",,,
,,Fabulous views across the bay,5,,So all major cities now appear to have one of these wheels but this one was far smoother in operation than others that I have ridden. Also was not busy like others but that just might be because I visited on a weekday.,,,
,,Flying and Viewing,4,,The best way to catch a glimpse of Singapore city skyline with the skyscrapers on one side and the beautiful harbor on the other side. Daytime view is good for the garden domes. Nighttime gives u a brilliant view of the supergrove trees. One round takes about 20 to 25 minutes and costs around 33 SGD. If u want to go one level up then try the flyer skydining experience.,,,
,,Singapore Sling Flight - definitely worth it!,5,,"Went on weekend night and so glad that we paid the higher price for the Singapore Sling. We had our 8 year old son with us who was given a cocktail and was so excited to have that.
We were personally escorted to the flyer and by-passed several hundred people queuing along the way - proceeding right to the front for the 8:30 flight - there were only 5 in our pd and it was truly magical. My husband who is scared heights found it safe, smooth and manageable without feeling scared or uncomfortable during the flight. He did stay away from the ends of the pod though.
A great experience on a clear night in Singapore.",,,
,,Make sure you go on a clear day,5,,"This affords the best views of Singapore by a long way, although it's obviously best to try and choose a day when visibility is clear. There are a lot of misty moments in Singapore! I went in the early evening so it got dark while I was on the wheel - this was lovely as the lights were all coming on around town by the time I got round to the start.

I'm not a great fan of heights but this goes slowly enough so you don't feel sick!",,,
,,Hop on just before sunset,5,,Takes about 30 mins to do 1 rotation. If you get on just at sunset you will get the spectacular view of the city of Singapore. If you can afford it there is a dining car. I didn't do that but it looked like an interesting experience. moves very slowly and the carriages are quite late so plenty of room to move around a get some great views and pictures. Preferably don't go when it raining as it does affect the view through the glass.,,,
,,great view,5,,off we went on the Singapore flyer and looked all over the magnificent city that is Singapore...then it was like all my Christmases came at once and delivered by Cindy Crawford...I looked down and there it was the Singapore F1 track....as a huge fan I left the flyer and walked the track stopping at the drivers garages for the compulsory photos...loved it...,,,
,,Great Views!,5,,"Provides great views of the city. The capsule moves slowly, taking about 1/2hr to do full loop, giving plenty of time to take photos and video. It's located right in the middle of the Formula 1 circuit and there are other things to do in the area. Highly recommend a visit.",,,
,,Nice Sunset view of singapore,4,,Opt for either the skypark of the flyer to see the sunset in singapore. One capsule allows 10-15 adults. you can book your own capsule by paying extra.,,,
,,Must See,5,,The giant wheel must be less than half the height of Marina Bay Sands but the view during evening time is breath-taking. You see entire SG from the flyer. Little pricey but worth a visit.,,,
,,"a nice, short ride",4,,"One of the best parts of the Singapore Flyer ride is the museum on the way in. It covers a wide variety of topics including art, architecture and other topics. One inside one of the Ferris wheel's closed compartments, it's a smooth ride up to some of the best views of the city. The grounds around the Flyer have restaurants, cafes, and pretty gardens as well.",,,
,,Great Views,5,,The flyer just reopened after 2 months so we were lucky to get a ride. The views were spectacular and it was very smooth. Rides ceased just after we got off due to stormy weather so don't bother going unless it is a fine day. Short walk from MRT station.,,,
,,Sunset on the Flyer!,5,,Wait for the sun going down and watch the city come alive before your eyes and all the lights go on from 165M up in the sky. Capsules are so slow you don鈥檛 realise you are moving - a must do attraction to visit!,,,
,,AMAZING VIEWS,5,,"We received a free ticket on this attraction as part of our Singapore Explorer Stopover Pass, and we were very impressed. The ride, which is like a giant Ferris Wheel, goes round once very slowly so that you get a good view of the city and other attractions. Some of our party were a little frightened of heights but were quite comfortable on this because of the low speed. The cabin itself is very comfortable ...an overall awesome experience.",,,
,,A Little Bit too expansive,3,,And we had a Bad day with Rain. It is ok But there are better Things to do in Singapore. And for just one round i think it is a Little Bit to expensive,,,
,,Amazing,5,,Wow just wow it鈥檚 a really nice Farris wheel the technology used is nice for first timers it鈥檚 a awesome experience,,,
,,Overview of Singapore,5,,"Singapore Fly is one of the famous place to visit. We could see the overview of Singapore. I suggest go there at night, so can see colourful Singapore.",,,
,,Shame it was not open.,1,,This great view venue was not open when we visited. Situated on the water front it gives a great view of the area.,,,
,,The largest observation wheel in the world!,5,,"Holding the distinction as the highest observation wheel in the world, each round will take at least 45mins with views of Singapore city as well as sea shore line. Epic",,,
,,Amazing 360 degree view,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a giant Ferris wheel. It stands at 165 metres, with a diameter of 150 metres, making it the tallest Giant Observation Wheel in the world. Twenty eight air conditioned Capsules each with a capacity to accommodate 28 persons slowly rotate and passengers could observe the 360 degree view of Singapore. A full round takes about half an hour. It has been an amazing experience for all members of the family.",,,
,,Amazinggggggggggg............,5,,"The Singapore flyer is just amazing, no words to describe the creativeness of the flyer. The view from the flyer is amazing but the cost is little high (33 SGD per person), the travel advisers only don't recommend this as the price is high.",,,
,,Photogenic landmark,4,,"Although I have never paid to go on this it serves as one of Singapores most photogenic landmark.

It is prevalent from most areas but especially Marina Bay and Gardens by the Bay.

This looks great during the day but even better in the night sky.",,,
,,Worthwhile,4,,"We were lucky to have the Singapore flyer re-starting just before we travelled. Went on a weekday, during a clear day, less crowd....we had the whole of cabin to us. great view.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"We did the tour at night. You have a great view of the area and the wheel is hoing very slowly, so if you have fear of heights it should not affect you too much.",,,
,,Great Place,4,,Amazing place especially if you go in the evening. The lights and the night views are magnificent. Very accessible,,,
,,Nice views,4,,Easy to visit with young children in strollers. We had the whole capsule to ourselves which our toddler loved. Nice/ok views. Although surrounding area/building is a bit sparse and not worth a visit for itself.,,,
,,Worth a visit!,5,,"We really enjoyed our time on the Singapore Flyer! The view is pretty amazing all around- you can see Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay, the city skyline and much more! The trip around takes roughly half an hour. There were lots of nice shops and eateries around as well. Worth a visit if you are in the area!",,,
,,You have to try it,3,,"Night or day, it鈥檚 amazing to look at but even better to experience it. Nice look at marina bay and all the beauty of Singapore.",,,
,,Asia's Largest Giant Observation Wheel,5,,"I feel it is one of the places in Singapore to be included in your itinerary. It offers a bird's eye view of entire Singapore which is second to none. Watching the Marina gardens by the bay, Marina bay sands and if you are lucky, you may catch sight of a cruise at the near-by cruise terminal. The complete circle takes roughly around 30-35 minutes for completion and the entirely glass-make capsule allows to you catch glimpses of Singapore from every nook and corner. So go for a roll....",,,
,,Definitely after the sunset,5,,We have arrived after 8 PM. The night views on the city are unforgettable! A good camera with night pictures mode is a must when boarding the Singapore Flyer in the evening.,,,
,,Highlight of the trip,5,,"Arrived around 5pm - had dinner in one of the many food outlets. Got to the platform at 6.30pm, it started to get dark around 7.30pm. Timed it just right to get photos during the day and evening in the one rotation. 8 in a capsule and plenty of room to wander around for snapshots.",,,
,,Flyer- birds eye view of the city,5,,"Get to relax and have a birds eye view of Singapore city, prominent landmarks and the water body. Night view is excellent compared to the day",,,
,,Great views no commentary,3,,"We went on the Singapore Flyer mid-week, which meant it was quiet and we got a pod to ourselves. We nice the ride started there was some welcome narrative and then that was it for the entire 30 mins, so regardless of the great views you didn't know what anything was. It was okay but a bit pointless if you only have a basic understanding of the city.",,,
,,This is NOT another big wheel,5,,This is the one! It claims to be the bigges. Certainly is a terrific way to see Singapore. We were spoilt in getting a carriage to ourselves. It pays to get there early. Well woth the cost.,,,
,,Unforgettable view!,5,,"Take the flyer at sunset time, but remember that any time the view of the fascinating city of Singapore is great.",,,
,,"Beautiful views, too expensive",4,,"The views are amazing;

On the negative side, very pricy for what it is (33SGD), it's a long walk to access to the flyer with a lot of unnecessary stuff on the way, staff is really trying to pack everyone in one cabin even with they could easily let you get in with you loved ones only at times where it's not crowded.",,,
,,Birds Eye View - Singapore Flyer,4,,"When you think about Singapore, Singapore Flyer is the first thing which comes to your mind.
It's a wonderful and one of the major point of attractions of Singapore & it covers all the major sight seeing from the air conditioned capsules.
For people with fear of heights... there's nothing to worry in Singapore Flyer, it's quite slow moving & sometimes you'll think is that even moving......

My family enjoyed the ride.",,,
,,Great view,5,,Enjoyed during the day but would be beautiful during the night. Catch MRT to promenade station for best access.,,,
,,Boring Zzzzzzzzzz,3,,"Ok please don鈥檛 get me wrong here but if your going to be stuck in a high up slow moving glass tube at least give me points of interest!
The F1 pit and oil tankers in the sea was not setting me alight in fact the highlight for me was I could see into my office window
Done it seen it never bought the t shirt",,,
,,Riding high,5,,This was a thrilling ride seeing all the beautiful sites from above. The cost was minimal and the ride was narrated throughout,,,
,,Good for views but not the best location,3,,Nice views and last about half an hour but not as central location as the sky park of Marina bay sands. Good views of sections of the Singapore formula one circuit.,,,
,,Best time around sunset! See both sun up and down!,3,,"Personally if you have been on a Ferris wheel anywhere before, it's similar. When it's crowded they fit more people into a carriage, less when it's early or late in the day.

I recommend around 6.30 before 7pm boarding to see sunset which you can see the difference between Singapore in the day and night.

Otherwise, being a nature lover I don't like to be enclosed in a box, and I wouldn't visit attractions like that unless I am bringing family. Good novelty for people that never seen it and maybe want to get past the fear of heights. Moves so slow, you don't know you are so high until you look directly down. Tip is don't look down of you are scared. Just look straight into the horizon!

Good for couples and lovers, the later the least people, nearer to their closing time.",,,
,,Enjoyable ride!,5,,The view from the Singapore flyer is spectacular. Worth taking pictures and it moves at a slow space so you have ample time to relax and just watch through the glass.,,,
,,Pricey but nice views of the city,4,,"So to get high up views in SG it鈥檚 either the Flyer or the Marina Bay deck, I opted for this. I went early morning and was one of the first customers. Had a cabin to myself. It鈥檚 really about getting to the highest point, so unlike the observation deck you are restricted on time. It would have been nice to have a bit more commentary but in all a relaxing ride and worth it if you are a first timer to SG. But if you鈥檝e been up the Marina I wouldn鈥檛 bother, you can get great views of the city (from ground level admittedly) from across Gardens by the Bay East.",,,
,,Awesome Ride,5,,The Singapore Flyer experience is very special especially since we went in the evening. The lights of the city and the Marina Bay area look magnificent.,,,
,,Great Views,4,,"Nice excursion, very light movement so you can't feel the motion. Clear views of city. Just don't get into a capsule full of people, they ruin the experience for you by talking too much!",,,
,,You could see ALL of Singapore!,5,,"You cannot leave Singapore without going on the flyer, it was so cool and you could see all of Singapore!",,,
,,Reopened for business !!,5,,The flyer wad closed for a few months to replaced parts needed to ensure complete safety of passengers. It is now reopened & running. Enjoy the rides again.,,,
,,Excellent views,5,,An excellent way to see Singapore in air-conditioned pods. The sights are amazing and the flights are well priced. I could happily have gone round a second time!,,,
,,Great views,5,,Not much crowded as the other attractions in Singapore. Must do if you want to see great views of the city.,,,
,,Pull a phat wheelie.,4,,"Round, round get a round I get around. Takes about an hour to get around. We stayed at Marina Bay Sands so saw the view anyway but it鈥檚 still a nice ride.",,,
,,Excellent views,4,,"The views from the cars on this wheel are excellent of the city, Gardens by the Bay, etc. It takes about 30 minutes to make the full circle. The cars are air conditioned so it is comfortable. Easy access from hotels in the area.",,,
,,Wonderful skyline view at night,4,,The ride on the flyer was very relaxing. You can't believe the skyline at night. Absolutely beautiful!,,,
,,excellent view of the city,5,,"the flyer is very similar to the London Eye, but smaller rooms (8 persons). Runs slow enough to have time to see the town and harbour from an advantage point. Very impressive",,,
,,singapore flyer,5,,"Fantastic View, Easy to take photos , pace was just right to go around, Clean and beautiful. situated in the perfect position. As we were on a cruise it was easy to see from the boat looked awesome.",,,
,,Like the other ones in every city,3,,"Every city must now have an 鈥楲ondon Eye鈥? It is what it is, an revolving observation facility. I鈥檝e never been to Singapore before so it was worth the trip around to see the sights of Singapore.

$S33 for a ticket, I felt was a little pricey but I did get a capsule to myself!",,,
,,Out of order when we visited,1,,"Unfortunately, this attraction was out of order when we visited at easter 2018. Not very good information, just a small sign at the entrance.",,,
,,Great journey,5,,Plenty to see and a great vantage point as expected. Akin to the London Eye but probably a shade more to see. worth it,,,
,,Visit after reopening after quite some time,5,,"Heard it was closed for 66 days, glad that it is opened when we visit the ferris wheel. Nice big wheel, lol",,,
,,Wow,5,,It is not so far from Marina Sands Bay. I went there during night. Though it was closed but did not forget to take photos. It is giant and really beautiful.,,,
,,Nice but not a WOW!,3,,Yes you can get a great perspective of the area and it is comfortable but having just come from The Skywalk at Gardens by the Bay the impact just wasn鈥檛 there for me. Personally I think taking a ride in the evening to see the light show at Gardens by the Bay while on The Flyer would be much nicer.,,,
,,Nice ride,5,,"Nice ride, nice view . One of the things that should be on your to dos list in Singapore. 360 degree view at top Try to do it in a clear day",,,
,,Unfortunately it was closed in March 2018,5,,This attraction was closed when I went to visit this place. However the administration of this flyer is really great. I checked on an email with them if it will be open and they responded immediately to all my queries. This have to be a nice experience,,,
,,Giant Wheel,5,,Singapore Flyer is not so far from Marina Sands Bay. This is a giant wheel having cabins which provides a panoramic view of Singapore City. It takes almost half an hour each spin. It's a great experience.,,,
,,Brilliant!,5,,"Excellent attraction, not to be missed on a Singapore trip, but get there early to avoid the tour buses",,,
,,Great view,4,,We went to this place at night time. Great way to view the marina bay & the city landscape. Good place to visit the tourist.,,,
,,The Flyer,5,,I am afraid of heights but was determined to do this. The cabins are very large (maybe would hold 30 people but only 10 in ours). It travels very slowly and gives plenty of opportunity to view from the 'safety' of the central seating. Eventually I could stand up but not venture too close the edge of the cabin. Absolutely amazing views of all areas of the city. And it is set above a Food Court and beautiful gardens. It took about twenty minutes for a complete revolution.,,,
,,Awesome,5,,Very good well run attraction provides a beautiful birds eye view of the entire city. Must visit for a Singapore trip.,,,
,,Jogging heaven,5,,The best place one can have a morning jog running through the F1 race track with a clear ocean view and most beautiful buildings in the world,,,
,,Very Nice View of Whole Singapore,5,,It was a very good experience for me and my family. I knew that it was one of the slowest flyers in the world but when it went so slow I was just very much embarrassed by it. Loved it. Must Give it a try.,,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"I will be honest, I could not ride on it as there were some technical issues today. But the view of this from other attractions is awesome. I am sure once aboard, it would give a nice view of city.",,,
,,Most attractive in Singapore,4,,"The Singapore flyer provides an opportunity to look at the city from a height on slow moving wheel which covers all the main attractions, Garden by the bay, Marina Bay Sands, Merlion Park, Art museum, Esplanade, Promenade areas...",,,
,,Worth it for first-time visitors,4,,"The Singapore flyer is worth a visit, especially for first-time visitors to this awesome city-state. Ride it once, then you can say you did. Cool views and if you are lucky you can see some arial planes aout or a festival in the park. Recommend it!",,,
,,only gud for 1 time visit,3,,"We went here late evening, although the view is good but I think it is overpriced, you can get a better view at CE LA VI on top of Marina Bay Sands with 2 cocktails at almost the same price",,,
,,Great visit in Singapore!,5,,"I had been wanting to visit the Singapore Flyer for quite some time as it is the biggest Ferris wheel in the world. I visited the ones in London, Seattle, and Chicago and this one blew them away! Such beautiful views of the city.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"After boarding 30 min ride with looking around Singapore. From there you can see Marina bay Sand hotel, Merlon, Garden by the Bay and more attractions.",,,
,,Magnificent Singapore Flyer,5,,"It is one of the biggest flyer in the world and believe me it is gives an astonishing view of Singapore city , especially Financial District, Marina Sands Bay, Marina Bay, Formula 1 Marina Circuit etc.

It is walking distance from above places which I have mentioned but too much of walk, better to take cab or taxi for coming. Try to reach early as crowd get built up, we were lucky to get in earlier, all tickets are available at the counter so no need to worry on those and all cards are accepted.

Overall a beautiful attraction in Singapore and must visit place.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Amazing views of Singapore!!! Go anytime, it is worth every cent!! Take lots of photos. It's the best.",,,
,,Must Do,5,,Have done a few flyers and this one has the 3 realestate p s. Position A top ride view Cheers Greg Wanneroo WA,,,
,,pretty amazing..,5,,"we loved this, well, great way for the views...we have one in London, but of course this seems so much nicer..then again, the views were new to us...great photo opportunity",,,
,,Try it - only if you've done everything else,3,,"As above, there are better things to do than to take the Singapore Flyer. It is a beautiful view of the city skyline, however there is not much else to it and you could easily go to Marina Bay Sands, or the Super Trees at Gardens by the Bay for a better experience.

This location is also somewhat inaccessible and not entirely convenient to travel to.",,,
,,Second biggest flyer in World,5,,"Singapore maintained this flyer in perfect art of management which makes it different from around the globe. It completes one trip approximately in 30 minutes. By this trip you will have Bird Eye view of Singapore. You can see business centre, Marina Bay Sands, Garden by the bays and downtown city. Here i am attaching some glimpses of Flyer trip.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"We were hoping to go on the Singapore Flyer and get some really good photos from that elevation, but unfortunately, it was closed until further notice. Maybe next time.",,,
,,Lets Try The Flyers,5,,If u go here prepare ur camera for selfie U can get amazing pics of Singapore Nearly same with the one in London england Its good to experience many things while u in Singapore I love Singapore Cheers Jun Peris Napitu,,,
,,Technical issue,2,,"It鈥檚 my 2nd time in singapore so the first agenda is to ride the flyer but to out surprise the flyer is closed due to technical issue :(

The place looks deserted only people there are the people that doesn鈥檛 know that the flyer is closed included us.",,,
,,Superb 馃枓,5,,"A must visit place when u r in singapore...try to visit it at night time if possible....it is observation ferry wheel.......u will see beautiful view of Singapore from flyer....it will take almost 30 minutes for a full round.....dinner facilities r also available in flyer, for that they will provide 2 rounds of ferry wheel so in 1 hour u can have dinner peacefully......amazing view and must do visit.....",,,
,,"Closed for Maintenance, No notice in the Internet",1,,"We went there and they said it was were closed for maintenance, No notice in the Internet about it. Wasted our valuable time. Should check before visiting the place. Better to call and see.",,,
,,Singapore Eye,5,,Singapore Flyer is nothing but similar to London Eye. This is very near to Marina Bay Sands and Marina Bay.,,,
,,Very dissapointing,1,,"Having booked an evening dining experience on the flyer, we were very disappointed to be informed that there were technical issues which meant our trip was cancelled. We understand that these things happen, however it appears that we were able to make our booking AFTER the flights were suspended due to the issue!! We have now been informed that it will take between 6 and 8 working WEEKS before we receive our refund! Terrible customer service. We definitely will not be recommending this to anyone.",,,
,,boring and slow moving,1,,"other than the view there nothing much to be up here. unless u want to be trapped in here with someone for a period of time, please avoid this slow moving ride. if its not free i wont b up here too.",,,
,,A place I definitely wanted to See.. But it was under Maintenance,4,,"I visited this place last week. Located very near to water makes it all the more exciting.
I could not experience the Joy on taking a ride on this and see the entire Singapore, because of the planned Maintenance.
But if given a chance again, i would surely want to visit this one as you get to see a lot of Singapore from High Up.
Good Place to click Photos inside the premise.
There is a small waterfall and a garden.
Few shops supplying Souvenirs and Food Items.",,,
,,Not Open,1,,We were in Singapore gor five days but never saw the flyer in operation even though we went by it every day.,,,
,,Bird eye view of Singapore from atop,5,,Wonderful ride awesome view good place to relax n learn about Singapore various segment n important icon,,,
,,Its boring,2,,"For me, the ride were just too short and not worth it comparing the money I have to pay. I visited singapore 3 times in my life, I enjoyed everything except this one...",,,
,,Excellent views,5,,"Bigger than the London Eye, and cheaper. Fantastic views over the city, the bay area with all the ships anchored off shore, and of course it overlooks the ""Pits"" for the F1 Gran Prix.",,,
,,Great view,5,,"Awesome view of the city, especially at night. We viewed this is a taxi. If you鈥檙e visiting the city this is a must see.",,,
,,A bit disappointed,3,,"We went on for our honeymoon to Singapore and this was the second day of our visit.
We were on city panormic ride which included all the major tourist attractions in the city.
On our ride to singapore flyer our guide informed us that this has been temporary closed because of some technical issues from last few months.
My wife and me were bit dissappointed on not to take ride on this huge flyer.
Inside the place you will find a nice garden with ponds having fishes in it.
I wont say best but good place for few good clicks.",,,
,,Great Ride,4,,Very fun and rmonatic thing to do. Totally enjoyed the trip and the views. Will do it again sometime soon,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"Huge Ferris wheel - there are such in all major tourist cities. It looks like that from the top will have a good view of the whole city. As many times as I passed, I did not see a ticket queue.",,,
,,Disappointment is an Understatement,2,,"This was the biggest disappointment of our two week anniversary trip between Singapore, Bali and Taipei.

My first activity I wanted to experience and share our special moment was with Singapore Flyer, and that never took place. Two weeks before our trip I received an automated e-mail stating due to technical difficulties the Flyer was not operational. We were given the option to immediately cancel or wait. As this was once in a lifetime trip, I was hopeful and waited. Three days later a second e-mail informing me the Flyer would likely not be operational and they would process a refund. IF YOU BOOK IN ADVANCE, YOU PAY AT TIME OF BOOKING. I have no issue with that to secure special events such as dinner or slings on board. When they cancel, you are informed refunds take 6 to 8 WEEKS. Unacceptable. Airlines refund quicker than this and they are notorious for cancellations.

When we arrived in Singapore we learned more about the technical difficulties from locals. We also were informed management has changed in recent years and more ""technical difficulties"" have occurred where the Flyer is not operational. Two different tour operators told us they have recommended against bookings as this has become more recent with financial issues. Initially I would have thought ""that's just tour operators steering visitors to other things."" Then we visited the Singapore Flyer grounds. It was deserted, on a weekend afternoon less than 10 people we saw around the sprawling area of the Flyer. There has to be some validity if everyone is keeping away, and it's a shame. I always thought of the Flyer as an icon of Singapore. Yes, it's still lit at night and that's beautiful (hence 2 star and not 1). There is no timeline to get the Flyer operational, instead the same message is repeated on technical difficulties. If that's the case, be transparent and don't process refunds in 6 to 8 weeks. If guests are required to pay up front for bookings, finances should be in order to reimburse.

Overall, extremely disappointed.",,,
,,A bad day.,2,,I when to this place on 5th of March however the flyer are close. Not a good day for us but we still enjoy the experience there.,,,
,,Awesome and beautiful experience,5,,Take a flight in singapore flyer. Have a wonderful time. The hallway upto the flyer gives you a beautiful visual treat. The flyer gives you a beautiful view of the city especially at night. It takes around 30 minutes for the entire circle. There are capsules that can be booked for meals. Flyer is a must when you are in singapore. Loved it.,,,
,,Better at night than the day,4,,A bit touristy as most locals won't have gone to this but it's not too bad if you go at night as it is less crowded and provides a good view of the city lights. Make sure it's not a cloudy/rainy/foggy day so you can really get a good view of the city,,,
,,A spectacular ornament!,3,,The Flyer is not operational. We were told they were waiting for key parts to arrive. It is a beautiful addition to the Marina Bay skyline especially fully lit at night.,,,
,,Bucket list,5,,Good value for money liked this as it was a very humid day so being in the air-conditioning capsule was a relief you get a good views all round and get an even better view of the marina bay hitel,,,
,,Great view relaxing sky cabin.,4,,"If you are first visit to Singapore, you should try this Flyer ride, especially ride between 6 to 7pm, stunning city view from day to sunset, beautiful photo taking opportunity for you. Cheers and enjoy.",,,
,,A fun activity,4,,The Singapore flyer is a great way to view the city landscape. It is a little pricey but worth it at least one time. The flyer takes almost an hour to make its revolution. The cars are large. Our family had the car to ourselves . It may be a little boring for teens but Ineould still recommend it.,,,
,,Stunning!,5,,Definitely a must visit when in Singapore! It's walking distance from Marina bay and absolutely stunning in the evening when the lights are lit.,,,
,,Birds Eye View of Singapore,5,,"Beautiful view. The Singapore Flyer is a lift that give you a birds eye view of Singapore. The view is breath taking as you rotate around. You feel safe within the glass. You can see forwards, backwards, up and down. It's absolutely worth it if you go to Singapore. The ride was about 30 minutes",,,
,,Advertise it is closed..... if it is not working,1,,Very disappointing to cross town to go on the Singapore flyer only to find it shut down for maintenance. I could find no reference to it being closed for repairs etc even though it must have been closed for at least a week. I was really looking forward to the experience / views from the big wheel.,,,
,,Seeing Singapore from up high,4,,Its a great spot to see singapore city centre from up. A definitely must do for those enjoying city views.,,,
,,Great experience,5,,If you want to have a landscape view of the whole city of singapore then this is the best option. Views from the flyer is just mind blowing. But try to avoid going there in the evenning because very less can be seen then.,,,
,,Go at night,5,,"if you admire city lights, you can visit them at night as there is nothing much to admire during the day. I wanted to try the dinner some time again!",,,
,,Still not had a refund of the 拢200 after the visit was cancelled because the flyer was not working,1,,"I appreciate that safety had to come first but we were only advised just over a week prior to our dinner booking that the flyer was not working, despite it being out of action for a number of weeks with no completion date for the works.

A month later we still do not have our refund, so it looks like we will have to ask our credit card people to try and get the money back for us. Fortunately even at such short notice we were able to book at C鈥檈st la vie on the Marina Bay Sands Skypark where we had a very good meal.",,,
,,Fantastic views,4,,Excellent experience for all the family. We had a great time looking out over Singapore. Well worth the time and money to put this on your itinerary.,,,
,,Good ride,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a decent ride to take. It's protected, instructive and the view is stunning. Ensure you have a sound manual for enable you to welcome the perspectives and to enable you to see sights you could miss without it.

We took the ride on a weekday so there weren't numerous individuals. No lines, no pausing. I don't recognize what it resembles on the ends of the week.

The ride takes around 25 to 30 minutes. It resembles riding a lift with floor to roof glass. It's an encased case and it's aerated and cooled.",,,
,,"Birds eye view of singapore,awesome",4,,"One must do it ,while in singapoee, you get a great view of marina bay , gardens by the bay, financial district, formula one race circit and the complete city.the capsules are air conditioned and it completes one circle in about 40 mins,,and u get only one to ride",,,
,,Disappointing,2,,The Singapore Flyer was out of action during our recent visit to Singapore for technical reasons. The flashing lights on it at night from a distance appeared to be moving but in fact it did not move for the whole week of our stay!,,,
,,Well worth a ride.,5,,"Really enjoyed a trip on the wheel, so much more pleasant than the London Eye. It was a bit of a walk to get to but we didn't mind that. Once we got there buying the tickets was a very smooth operation and we only had to wait around 5 mins to get into one of the pods.
Some really good views of the City. ad a cheeky little walk on the Grand Prix track afterwards.",,,
,,A beautiful place to see at night !,5,,"Nothing much to say as the other reviews have mentioned, Singapore Flyer is absolutely beautiful can walk there from Marina Bay it's very close.",,,
,,Disappointed,1,,It was possibly due to Chinese New Year but it always seemed to be closed. We were dropped off by a taxi to be told it wasn't operating that day. We didn't ever see it operational for all the time we were in Singapore.,,,
,,Excellent view,5,,"Amazing experience! We went late at night and the view was just stunning! It was our last night at Singapore and we just wanted to do something that is close to our hotel and more relaxing, and this ride was exactly what we needed! A must see if you want to witness the stunning view of the city.",,,
,,Ride and View,4,,This ride is good.you can have a couples dinner organizer too and will serve you dinner at cost.You can see the Singapore from this ride and enjoy the view.,,,
,,Amazing view of the bay,5,,"We had the dinner. It was a great meal, well worth the experience. Best dinner with the best view in Singapore. If you don't want to eat, you can ride it, but I recommend the view at night.",,,
,,Stunning view of Singapore!,5,,"Totally loved the Singapore Flyer! We went in the evening and it was the best thing we did. As an when you go up, you see the stunning 360 view of Singapore from the top. Absolutely worth it!",,,
,,Travellers Update - Disappointed,1,,"We have just returned from Singapore. My wife desperately wanted a trip on the Flyer. We took the Hop On Hop Off bus (Yellow Line) which dropped us off at the Flyer facility. On entering we were informed that the Flyer has been out of serve since the beginning of January due to a lightning strike and they were waiting for spare parts, with no re-opening date yet planned. I urge you to check before going to see if the Flyer is back up and working",,,
,,Third time lucky,4,,We had tried to go on the Singapore Flyer on another visit but it wasn't working due to thunderstorms. Similarly on our next visit we could tell it wasn't working when we were at Gardens by the Bay- more thunderstorms. Finally on this visit we not only found the Singapore Flyer working but we were able to go on it without queues. Despite being a cloudy day the views were good and we enjoyed our time on the Flyer.,,,
,,Panromic view,4,,The cabin is very well to accommodate visitors and they can freely move around. Best part is you get beautiful view of the city and F1 race tracks.,,,
,,An absolute highlight!,5,,"We did not book ahead, simply turned up around 17.00 hrs. Amazingly, we got a pod to ourselves which really added to the whole experience. We loved it, great views, changing light, fabulous throughout.",,,
,,We love it,4,,A lot of tourists just complain about this Flyer. We found very relaxing to join the trip. The cabin is big. We can see Singapore from 'above',,,
,,A 鈥渕ust do鈥?5.0,,"If it wasn鈥檛 for Marina Bay Sands, the Singapore Flyer would dominate the skyline. Similar to the London Eye, but bigger (the world鈥檚 largest), the Flyer gives you great views of the Gardens by the Bay and the Harbour area.

We treated ourselves and took a Singapore Sling Flight (S$69 - S$33 for a normal flight) at sunset, which was a great way to end our holiday.

Fantastic views - and a really nice Singapore Sling. A 鈥渕ust do鈥?",,,,
,,Beautiful View.,5,,"My wife and I were very fortunate that the car we had was with just another couple.
This allowed us to have an unobstructed view of the Singapore Harbor, the Gardens by the
Bay, and the entire garden city amongst other views. Absolutely beautiful. The
ride takes about 20 minutes So you can relax and take a lot of panoramic pictures. It was a little pricey at $65
It was a little pricey at $65 to $70 U.S Dollars. It advertises Senior Citizen discount
But this is only for Singapore residents. You can also get a car and have dinner as well.",,,
,,Was it in operation,3,,"Lovely to look at, a version of the London Eye, a slow moving Ferris wheel that gives you a chance to see the skyline of Singapore. We passed it 3 times in one day and I didn鈥檛 even see if any one was operating it, certainly it did not move at all. However, it is a marvel of engineering nevertheless and worth photographing, even if it didn鈥檛 run when we were there.",,,
,,Lovely view,4,,"It is a great place to go with family. Singapore flyer offers a great view of the Marina bay sands, gardens by the bay, helix bridge etc. The best time is to be around sunset. I went there with my parents and they loved it!",,,
,,Nice Views,3,,"A good way to appreciate the marina landscape because all major landmarks are visible from the top of the flyer.

It tends to get a bit crowded so ask the attendant to let you get on the next one if you鈥檇 like to get some scenic photos without people in them.

The walk up to board the flyer is pretty interesting.",,,
,,After Grand Prix,4,,We was there the weekend after the Grand Prix and you got a great view of the start finish line. Plus a great view of the football pitch in the quay side and the botanical gardens.,,,
,,Wonderful,4,,We had a great view it was very easy to get to on the singapore rail network the grounds were very well set out and we fed the fish in the pond at the base and there were some places where you could purchas nfood and drinks,,,
,,Looks like you are in heaven,4,,Singapore flyer must explore if you want 360 degree view of this beautiful city then go for it this is similar like London Eye much bigger and will take you the breathe away once you on the top of the flyer really enjoyable and difference experience,,,
,,Wow!,5,,"A great experience! An attraction to do, the view up there is amazing, particularly in the sunset. Beautiful!",,,
,,Not for the Acrophobic,5,,"Enter into the gondola and take a ride to the heavens. A pretty unique experience, giving a magnificent view of Singapore",,,
,,A must do experience,5,,"I thought going on at dusk would be busy but perhaps we were just lucky. Only 6 people in our cabin at 640pm meant we had space to take in the city as it went dark. The whole experience is breathtaking as the city is spread out before you if you are an F1 fan you can visualise the whole circuit as you go round,, brilliant .",,,
,,Highest level to see singapore,4,,Singapore flyer is near to marina bay hotel and this flyer is pick hights every thing us shown small any building. In the flyer total no of cabin is 28 . And one cabin capacity is 8 person . Total time 28 minutes take for one round and price is sgd 43 approx per adult,,,
,,Excellent,5,,Really an experience in Singapore not to be missed fabil矛ous experience.cars are not over crowed so plenty of room to move about and take im all the views.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"Great views at night, bring your binoculars if you want to see the far end of Singapore night sky. Great experience but probably only need to go once.",,,
,,Great view of Singapore,5,,Take the Flyer to see Singapore from the sky. A treat for the family and a wonderful view of Singapore.,,,
,,Beautiful,4,,One of the best way to see the whole of singapore. A bit too slow but then worth relaxing and enjoying the beautiful tall buildings around the city of singapore.,,,
,,Good experience,5,,Had a nice time doing the Singapore Flyer. It takes 30mn for a reasonable price and a great view. I would recommend this experience at least once :),,,
,,Smooth,5,,"Pleasantly surprised with the ease of access and blown away by the views. We were lucky, we went in the morning and had clear skies. Our ride was very smooth and the view from the top was mind blowing.",,,
,,Not a definite must see for tourists,3,,The Singapore Flyer isn't anything to scream about - after all Singapore is a urban jungle and there are buildings all around!,,,
,,fantastic views,5,,"been on the Flyer twice while in Singapore for the GP last year.
enjoyed it both times and on each 'flight' it offered fantastic views of Singapore.
would like to go on it when it is dark next time we are in Singapore as Singapore after dark is awash with coloured lights all around you.",,,
,,Best view in Singapore !,5,,"Fab experience in Singapore, view is fantastic, just above the Gran Prix circuit. View of all Singapore.",,,
,,Fly to the sky....slowly:-),5,,Definitely experience the Flyer when in Singapore. We went late afternoon & luckily not a big queue so we didn鈥檛 have to wait long at all. The flyer takes 30mins to go right around. The view is amazing. The capsules are very big & spacious with seating & standing. Well worth it.,,,
,,Great view of Singapore but frankly Over rated,3,,"This is nothing but a giant Ferris wheel that moves so slow that you do not even realize that it is moving. it takes about close to 30 minutes for one round. You do get good view of the Marina Bay area but I do not think it is worth spending so much for that. You could rather save that money and use it up to go on top of the MarinaBaySands to the Ku De Ta. Yours and your partners ticket put together may not suffice for a glass of wine over there. But by just adding a little more you will get to be there, look at great views and enjoy a romantic drink. Also if you have done London Eye then please do not do Singapore Flyer.",,,
,,Beautiful View!,4,,"I enjoyed the beautiful sight of the whole city of Singapore gleaming through the night flash lights.
It鈥檚 such a beautiful view! The amazing staff too, adds to the fun at this spot; l had a chance to enjoy my coffee at the neighboring restaurant, overlooking the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Gardens by the Bay which is worth the risk. I can visit this spot more and more and more.",,,
,,Stunning Views!!,4,,Flew into Singapore for a week and had a few days to kill. I took some time and went over to Singapore Flyer. The view is spectacular!! It's a full view of the city. It's a lot like the London Eye but taller. I would recommend taking a couple of hours and spend time at the Singapore Flyer. Take your Camera!!!,,,
,,Good,4,,Beautiful lights .good amazing variety of flowers .can be seen for a change .it has more variety of trees and flowers which we never noticed earlier at any flower show,,,
,,Great views of Marina Bay,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is higher that the London Eye. The ride is very smooth and the view from the pods is excellent. Certainly, worth going for the ride. There is a souvenir shop and a few restaurants in the vicinity of the Flyer.",,,
,,Breathtaking View,5,,"One of the best experience, where you can have panoramic view of the city. It was around half and hour or so and was worth experiencing. You can see even the northernmost islands of Indonesia. It was ultimate view.",,,
,,Yes it is a flyer !,4,,"A must visit on the Singapore itinerary as it is the highest flyer but all said and done the London flyer has a better views from any angle surrounded by history , This one has sea and sky scrapers to view , thats it .",,,
,,A great view of Singapore,5,,"There are two good times to visit the Singapore Flyer, either in the morning when the light is great for a view across the Bay and Marina Bay, or in the early evening when the lights of the City are spectacular. Very much in a similar way to the London Millennium Wheel.
Definitely worth a visit when you are visiting Singapore",,,
,,Great experience!,5,,It was really nice to see all the beautiful sightseeing place from the top. Place is easy to find and staff are helpful.,,,
,,Great but not as good as the London Eye,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is not as large as the London eye but well worth going on to get the view of Singapore. It is central located at Marina Bay and has a fantastic rainforest garden and fish pond below the wheel that you can walk through before or after the wheel at no cost. Unfortunately is was a bit over cast the day we went on but still had a great view over Singapore, they say on a clear day you can see Indonesia and Malaysia. The ride takes about 30 minutes which gives you plenty of time to take photos. The staff helping you on and off are friendly and do not over pack the air conditioned capsules with people.",,,
,,a must if you visit singapore!,5,,"if you have the choice of sand or th wheel: chose the wheel
you will have a nice experience and have sensational views!
book your tickets in advance at peek hours or night time
especially when the laser show is on
hope this is helpful?!?

,,"Nice Place to visit,",5,,"We went there to have lunch at Bhandari's Restaurant. The Flyer was not operating as it was the break. The Scenary from top is beautiful, Surrounding Bay area also very nice",,,
,,Incredible views time it right,4,,Luckily we had been to the gardens the day before so when we had our tour we timed the ride for the light show below. perfect was so nice to see this and all the surrounding views,,,
,,Breathtaking views,5,,Want to see the whole of Singapore in 30 minutes just head to Singapore flyer. The views were amazing during the night. Each cabin can accommodate more than 10 people but when we went it was just our family. We had a wonderful time here. Must see in Singapore.,,,
,,Better at night,5,,"Loved the view from the peak, however i think it would be better at night. Visited in the afternoon, no lines.",,,
,,Can visit once.,4,,"Clean and quiet. Should go if you want to click good Singapore skyline pictures BUT would not recommend going there if you plan to visit Marina bay deck. Pictures come better over there.

One full circle does not takes long time and is peaceful up there :)",,,
,,Good for an overview of Singapore,5,,"We went on a clear day in the morning, but I suspect it's really good at twilight time. Great views and well organised.",,,
,,Great Ride,5,,Amazed with great view as was clear sky. We have been in flyer couple of times but always want to come back.,,,
,,It was okay,3,,We went at 7pm which was perfect because we saw the SG night lights. We also saw the Gardens by the Bay show from the flyer. It was just average and can be skipped if you're visiting SG. I found the ticket price to be very expensive.,,,
,,must do,5,,"Good ride and nice overview of the city. We did it during the day, but during the night could be the better timing for a romantic moment.",,,
,,Wheel with a view,5,,An incredible journey to seemingly the top of the world. The view was amazing and it was a very comfortable ride. Would recommend the wheel.,,,
,,At night might have been better,4,,The cars are very large and air conditioned. U can easily stand up and walk around to snap pictures. I did it in the day time but it's probably better at night.,,,
,,Excellent views,5,,"Enjoyed this very slow ride. A very good opportunity to get great photos. The carriages are quite big with lots of glass to the floor for good views and some are set aside as dining carts which is a great idea. The views across to the Gardens in the Bay, Marina Bay & the Marina Bay Sands building puts it into perspective how large this complex is. The ride was worth the money & being air conditioned it was a most enjoyable activity. Felt totally safe as the structure is well built & well maintained.",,,
,,Nothing out of the blue.,3,,Probably i am born n grow up here thus find the view nothing impressive as it seems normal. Pricey compared to some other famous ferris wheel in other parts of the world.,,,
,,singapore icon,4,,As a lot of reviews have stated it鈥檚 a tad pricey.. But you are on holidays and it鈥檚 an icon of SE Asia. We visited while over this part of town at marina bay sands/gardens by the bay.,,,
,,not sure but great,5,,We were not sure how much we would enjoy as we have not been on any other major wheel but it was very enjoyable and and had a very smooth ride. my wife does not care for hights but still enjoyed the ride,,,
,,Beautiful view,3,,"Its an expensive giant wheel, takes half an hour atleast for 1 circle. Gives a beautiful view of the whole singapore island. Its very high bt has a very very slow speed so no reason to fear.",,,
,,"One of the best views from any ""eye""",4,,"Our family had promotional vouchers (other wise it is a bit expensive).
It is worth going at sunset (about 7:30pm) to see the CBD when at apogee of ride and take some great pics. From here at ground level one can also see the skyline along the water.

Go, at least once.

Easy to get to by MRT",,,
,,Great view of the city,4,,Would recommend everyone do the flyer. You get to see the layout of the city etc Thoroughly enjoyed it fantastic photos as well,,,
,,Enjoyed it every bit,5,,"The Flyer was part of the city tour and we fully enjoyed it. What an amazing view of Singapore ! Large capsules with a capacity to occupy 20+ folks is an ultra large merry-go-round at a slow pace. Takes about 30+ minutes for the full circle.

You can do it once, worth the visits and the grand view of the sea and the city.",,,
,,Breathtaking views,4,,"Been on the Singapore Flyers a few times and it鈥檚 never disappointed us. As the skyline of Singapore is always changing, it feels like In on the flyer for the very first time.
Only minus of this is the cost of it. Its rather costly for a 30mins ride. But worth it if you are doing it for the first time.",,,
,,Singapore view,4,,"You can have 360 singapore view, the best time for visit is at evening. But price is too much for one turn.",,,
,,Popular and good,4,,This is a popular attraction so was a queue and worth to see as the views are some of the best available in Singapore.,,,
,,Must go!,5,,Luckily I went to this attraction when it was still open. Few days ago it was closed indefinitely for maintenance. We can have lots of beautiful landscapes of Singapore from there beyond spending a good time with friends and family. A must go attraction!,,,
,,Bird's Eye view,5,,"We were pretty much got in straight away as we were there early as soon as it opened. The ride was excellent, giving us a good view of Singapore as a whole city as it was on a clear sunny morning. Well worth the visit.",,,
,,check the weather forecast before you go,4,,"It is a ""must see"" attraction when you are in Singapore. Ride is approximately 45 minutes and gives a birds eye view of the city. Do not give you the ""wow"" effect, but worth to go as this is the asia's biggest wheel. It is not operating during lighting so we had to come back on the first day and go on another day. Check the weather forecast before you go.",,,
,,Scenic,5,,"The flyer gives a good scenic view of the skyline. Being the biggest in the world at the moment, probably worth a visit.",,,
,,Great view,5,,I had visited this place during day time but I can surely imagine how good the view must be around evening. The view during the day was also amazing and the staff was very courteous. Afterwards you can just pick up a coffee or a sandwich from the many restaurants in the area and sit by the river overlooking the Marina Bay sands hotel and Gardens by the bay. The view from the river bank is also breathtaking.,,,
,,360 singapore view,4,,Looks wonderful from outside but it looks more better once you sit inside. Flyer shows you the 360 view of Singapore. Try to go in evening when Singapore lites up in lights.,,,
,,30 minute view of the City,3,,"Probably a good way to get an overview of Spore. However for $33 for a 30 minute ride - was a tad on the expensive side. Getting in and out of the capsule could be improved. Signposting and directions to the Flyer ticket box were not clearly visible and did not facilitate getting there for visitors who came by foot from the MRT station, given that it is quite a walk esp when the sun is v hot and roads have to be crossed to get there..",,,
,,Reach high for birds eye view of singapore,4,,If you wish a birds eye view of Singapore you must take this activity. This is Asia's most giant wheel. The rotation takes about 45 minutes and one can also take private dine in flight which of course cost a bomb but could be a life time experience to boast around with friends and others.,,,
,,Good Experience,3,,"We went at the night. It's a good view from the top. You can see big part of Singapore at night, but if you stayed at Marina Bay Sands, it's the same view from the Sky Pool, you won't see something different.

At night it was a bit cold in the cabins.",,,
,,Flyer,5,,We waited for nearly half and hour to finally step in flyer. It gives amazing view of the beautiful Singapore skyline,,,
,,Great! Of course a giant Ferris wheel nothing wrong with that.,4,,"Hard to miss, and not far from other landmarks worth seeing. Taking pictures in the evening, though beautiful, not the best of conditions because the light reflection and glare.",,,
,,Expensive but worth doing once while in Singapore,4,,"On a clear day, the view is magnificent. It is not cheap but I have done it once and it makes for a nice memento of my visit to Singapore. Worth a visit (you can even do it at night).
There are some restaurants in the complex itself, and nearby, you will find the Suntec Mall with lots of shops, restaurants and even a movie theatre.",,,
,,Views from High,5,,Similar to the London Eye. S$33 per adult. Excellent trip and views - 24 minutes in the pod. Well worth it. Plenty of eating places and gift shops nearby.,,,
,,Amazing!!!,5,,"We went here last December as part or our singapore stopoverfor my birthday treat, we really enjoyed it especially my kids and the view was spectacular! Although i was afraid of the heights and didn't move a lot lol still I did enjoyed it and you wont even feel that its moving. I do recommend to everyone who will visit Singapore.",,,
,,Great ride.,5,,We had a great time on the flyer. Views are terrific of Singapore. A must do venue for visitors. We went late afternoon and got right on.,,,
,,Wonderful Experience,5,,We went on the Singapore Flyer at night. An amazing experience with great views. Takes about half an hour to do the full circle. Would highly recommend if visiting Singapore.,,,
,,"Up, Up and What A View!!",5,,"We went here on 22/1/18. Did not know what to expect as we have done these in Hong Kong, London, etc.. Pleasantly surprised with the ease of access and blown away by the views. Yes we were lucky, we went in the morning and had clear skies.. Even taking all that into consideration I rate Singapore Flyer at 5/5. Do not even bother paying S$20 to go to the top of Marina Bay Sands. High Recommended.",,,
,,No need to visit this place,1,,I wasted mny and time for this place as i thought i will have complete view of singapore from the top. But next day when i went to marina sands hotel roof by paying 25 sgd it鈥檚 much more fascinatin than this place. so do gonto marina sands roof top if u wanna be on the highest point in singapore.,,,
,,A must do when In Singapore,5,,Absolutely loved the Singapore flyer. Our ride was very smooth and the view from the top was mind blowing.,,,
,,Just what we had been waiting for .,5,,In Singapore on a stop over and the Flyer can be seen from miles around .Very good well run attraction but the on site photos are a bit of a con . and you must examine very closely because they can be poor -they are expensive as well .,,,
,,Singapore Eye,5,,"This is a nice tourist spot. Developed much in the concept of London Eye this Singapore flyer provides a beautiful birds eye view of the entire city. The circle takes 45-50 min to take a complete round. This is an amazing experience and you have all the elements of safety build into that ride, therefore only fun and frolic no fear. Must visit for a Singapore trip...",,,
,,This was great,4,,Thoroughly enjoyed this. A must do if you are in Singapore. Book tickets on your Handy phone as these are often at discount rates,,,
,,Good!,4,,"Actually I was there 10 years ago. It cost $1 a minute up there based on the ticket price then. Overall nice experience, the view was good, and now the view is different. Worth going but if you had complimentary tickets like me, all the better!",,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,"Didnt have to wait a long time to board-would not recommend to those afraid of heights. Overall view of Singapore, a bit expensive but worth it.",,,
,,Family outing,5,,"A great view of the Singapore skyline. We were there in the afternoon so we have a clear view of the business district, shopping districts and residential areas. Also see some part of Malaysia borders. If we take in the night the view will be spectacular. Thanks",,,
,,The Biggest,5,,Grateful to see the overview of wonderful Singapore and privileged to ride the biggest flyer in the world.,,,
,,Most Awesome Wheel ride ever!,5,,"This wheel looks like its standing still, looking from a distance. It actually takes 30min to complete one circumference, and is slow enough to allow for various photo taking opportunities. The carts are huge. We were 3 families inside, but there is more than enough room to move around and still be able to take pictures of the views from all angles possible. This is a highly recommended thing to do in Singapore...",,,
,,Amazing night view,4,,I think it's better to visit in the night as you get the spectacular view of Singapore. Worth every cents.,,,
,,Good,5,,I am scared of heights but this was ok. We did get caught up in a coach party but with only 8 people on board we had plenty of room to move around. Staff were helpful and well organised. Views were spectacular and because it was slow plenty of camera oportunities,,,
,,Must Do Activity,5,,"It not to expensive, and give you a beautiful view of the city and area. Line moves fast and the experience memorable.",,,
,,Tourism,5,,"It's a thrill for Singapore flyer and it is very nice to fly, we enjoyed by seeing city by flyer on top level",,,
,,Good viwes of Singapore,4,,"Quite expensive for a half hour experience, however the views are great. We went there during the day, which was great, but I think an evening visit would give an awesome night time view of the city.",,,
,,stunning way to see the city views,5,,"highly recommmend this well organised attraction. We opted for the Singapore Sling trip which offered a cocktail and comfortable siting aswell as priority boarding, well worth the extra few $. Dont forget your camera!",,,
,,VERY GOOD PANORAMIC VIEW,4,,when you reach top you feel on the TOP OF THE WORLD. Gives you a 360 degree view of Singapore.A must in the itinerary.,,,
,,good city views,4,,It takes about 30-40 minutes to go around one time....the movement is not too bad..I was afraid of getting dizzy. Obvious for me was the views of the city being the best part of this ride.,,,
,,a view from the top!,5,,"At first I hesitated, but it was an experience not to be missed. it's so pleasant at night as you get to see the whole city with fantastic lights, especially the gardens by the bay and the supertrees.
The entrance rate wasn;t that high, I got a discount when I presented my singapore air boarding pass.",,,
,,Singapore View at its Best ..,5,,Initially thought was a roller coaster ride and was not even looking at it .. but then decided to take a ride and it was worth every moment and every penny .. Suggestion is to visit evening time in the lights .. Loved it to the core ..,,,
,,Singapore Flyer.,5,,"This tall Ferris wheel dominates the Bay Area skyline, and is excellent, in that it must be one of the slowest turning wheels in the world - so much so that it's movement is almost imperceptible at first to the naked eye.",,,
,,flyer,4,,"Neat way to see the city. One of the cars got stuck sideways so we had to wait for them to bring that car down, but overall it was a nice experience and great views.",,,
,,This was an amazing experience,5,,"I was surprised by a dinner on the Flyer. Besides the wonderful views , we enjoyed a 4 course meal in our capsule. Appetizer and soup on the first rotation followed by main course and dessert on the second rotation. We started at dusk and enjoyed the city views transformed into nighttime. Food and service was very good.
Even if you just go for a ride, you will enjoy the amazing views.",,,
,,Fabulous way to see the city,5,,"Great value for money. The views are spectacular, well maintained and the engineering impressive. Take the time to indulge in the Fish Reflexology too. Plenty of giggles and feel great after.",,,
,,Another great view,4,,Just a nice view of Singapore skyline... nicer to go during the night. It was pricey for a short moment though.,,,
,,Bird's eye view,5,,"After a red eye flight from Kathmandu, we caught the MRT down to the Singapore flyer. We had lovely clear skies, which gave us a stunning view of Singapore as we went around. We shared our pod with just two other people, so it was not crowed and we could all walk around in the pod without getting in each other's way.",,,
,,What a VIEW!!!!,5,,The flyer gives you an eminent view of the entire city with all the sky rises and the stadium views from one point. The best view is of the sea with such great intensity. A great place to get pictures for the entire city.,,,
,,Singapore skline,5,,"The Flyer, along with the Marina Bay Sands three towers, dominates the Singapore skline and its a mistake not to take one trip on it. Easy on and off, not expensive, and great views for miles from every direction. Well worth a trip when you are in Singapore",,,
,,Great view,4,,Impressive piece of engineering. We boarded the ride later in the day and took some great dusk photos of the area and surrounding buildings which were all individually lit with various coloured lighting. If you鈥檙e visiting the area you have to try it.,,,
,,Cool way to see the city!,4,,"At first glance this looks like a ferris wheel, but it's no such thing as the Flyer moves so slowly that it's more like a sightseeing jaunt around the city than a ride. It takes roughly a half hour to circumnavigate the wheel, and the views are spectacular throughout.",,,
,,Best views of marina Area...,4,,Will only take 0.5 hours and select the best time around sun set. You will get amazing city view 360!!!!,,,
,,Worth a visit,4,,"Well worth a visit, was quite when we went so only about 10 in our capsule so able to walk around and get all the different views.",,,
,,30 minuets fun,5,,"Great to get a good view from Singapore and some nice pictures.
We went 2 times on the flyer and we never had to wait long and we never had many peoples in the cabin.
You see the formula 1 course the marina bay the ocean the gardens by the bay and a lot more.
Just great:)",,,
,,divine experience,5,,Its one of the beautiful experience from where view of city is totally different. It was around half and hour or so and was worth experiencing. The view at night was extremely beautiful and make you forget everything besides. The speed of the flyer was extremely slow and is totally safe for all. Just enjoy this mesmerising journey.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer - Important place,5,,"Next to Merlion, which is the symbol for SG, Singapore flyer is another symbolic attraction of SG. Beautiful place to enjoy. Lot of people say that we should visit in the evening. But we preferred to visit in the morning hours. There is less rush in morning hours. Secondly, you can have a view of the entire city including nearest country - Malaysia. The trip is around 35-40 minutes and flyer takes us to around 160 meters. Very unique experience. Not to miss",,,
,,Leisure,3,,Couldnt feel the movement and the thrill....for short time and should 2 rounds to feel the embience and surroundings....,,,
,,Even good in the rain,4,,"We had one of those days where it just did not stop raining. Undeterred we went off to the Singapore flyer. This was my second time on it so we decided to go in the evening and I would recommend this. We went at sunset so we could see both Singapore at day and night.
Perhaps due to rain there was no queue.
One rotation takes about a half hour. There can be 8 people per carriage so you may have to share with strangers.
We still got some great photos and this is definitely one of the sightseeing highlights.
I am not fond of heights but I felt quite secure in the carriage.",,,
,,Nice view,4,,"This is a nice place to spend half an hour or so while looking at the city from above. Come 15-30 minutes before your ride time. There is a queue that can get long at pick hours.
There was nothing wrong with the Flyer itself or the service.
I am giving it 4 stars because of the noise. If you happen to ride with a loud group, then it can spoil the whole experience. There was a 5-6 people group from a big Asian country nearby, who kept showting at each other instead of talking. We asked them to be a little bit quieter, but it didn't make much of a difference.
Still, the view at night is very nice. Try timing it, so you will be up in the air when the light show below starts. It brings an additional part to the experience.",,,
,,It does what it says and it costs what it says; what's so hard? This is a great trip.,5,,"This is a 30 minute ride on a non-stop slowly moving wheel that gives great views of the Singapore Bay region, out to sea, the Marin Sands Hotel, Gardens by the Bay and the Formula 1 track right below. The price is clearly displayed before you pay. It doesn't run when there are storms or heavy rain because they take your safety very seriously and you wouldn't see much anyway.
If you are expecting dancing girls in your cabin or views of the hanging Gardens of Babylon, or Wildebeests sweeping majestically across the open Plains, then you will be disappointed.",,,
,,Loved it !,5,,"A very professional set up, not unlike the London eye.
Great views over the gardens in the bay and the Marina Bay Sands.
You will be expected to share a pod but they are very spacious with seating provided.
Best way to get there is on the hop on bus as we used the MRT and it was quite a hike to get there from the stop. The bus goes right in to the car park.
Do this for fab photo opportunities !",,,
,,"Wow, Envigorating",5,,"Hesitant to get on the Flyer because of height issues, but I have to say the views from the top of the flyer was fantastic. Could not walk to the windows but still had the same great views from the centre seats. Well worth the money",,,
,,Great View,5,,"Great view for all city. If you can, go at the sunset. You will Have a spetacular view from the gardens by the bay lights.",,,
,,Premium champagne flight,4,,"30 minutes per ride with great view although it's drizzling, they provide plate of chocolates, cup of champagne, and yes we enjoy one cabin with no others as not many people took premium champagne flight.",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"Bigger than the London eye, great views. We went at night and the light show was going on down at the bay (8 and 9 p.m.) Very pleasant way to see the city.",,,
,,okay ride,3,,nothing to spectacular about the flyer..the city view and the river view is good for first timers but nothing to compare with London Flyer,,,
,,Offers a great view of the city.,3,,The Singapore flyer is a giant Ferris Wheel which has 28 air conditioned capsules for you to sit and enjoy a bird's eye view of the city. So you can see as far as Indonesia or Johar in Malaysia and the beautiful ocean below you . You can also spot some landmarks like Raffles place Merlion park and is priced at $33 for adults and $21 for children it opens at 8:30 a.m and the last time to enter is 10 pm. Each round takes about 30 minutes to complete. The Singapore flyer is one of the popular tourist destination and is a must visit when you visit Singapore..,,,
,,Beautiful view,5,,Singapore flyer is the best place to view the city! It's beautiful views of whole city! I did family trip it's was an amazing time spend!! If your in Singapore u should ride!!,,,
,,You can have the same views for free,3,,"I have had the same (or better) views from the many rooftop bars around the city (C茅 la vi at Marina Bay Sands; Lantern; SuperTree). Queue is very very long, staff is not friendly, just trying to push you the other attractions in the building",,,
,,Flying high,5,,Great way to visit satosa island..amazing high view..brilliant restaurant at snag side.. excellent family value,,,
,,Breathtaking View,4,,"This is the third time i came to the world highest flyer in Singapore yet i was very excited about it when i recalled those breathtaking view. This time i brought my friends from UK, they loved it so much. i would like to try it out again next time if i visit Singapore again.",,,
,,Spectacular Views of Singapore,5,,When my husband & I visited at the beginning of November it was very quiet & we had no waiting time to go on the Flyer which was great. If you have been on a similar attraction such as The London Eye then you know what to expect with th only difference being the views. The flyer offers spectacular views of all of Singapore & great photo opportunities. We went during the day but would have loved to went back at night to see the City lit up. Well worth doing.,,,
,,For clear days,3,,"We went on a cloudy, rainy day, bad choice. Also would recommend booking the cocktail experience, which we didn鈥檛 do, but it would be more fun! The view is amazing but the wheel moves very slowly. If anyone is uncomfortable with heights, don鈥檛 book. The line can be very long and you will be grouped with other people, so be prepared for that.",,,
,,Birds Eye Vista of city,3,,"This giant ferris wheel offers panoramic views of the city in a 30 min cable capsule ride. Did this on Jan 2, 2018 in the morning.",,,
,,Must view Singapore from here,4,,Great viewpoint of Singapore from 165 m hight you can see almost all the attractions of city from here with feel of safety A big size glass cabin provide 360 viw of city Must for one time experience,,,
,,The London Eye but in Singapore!!,5,,A must do but just like any other big wheel in a big city. Great vistas of the surrounding and attractions.,,,
,,Great experience,4,,This is a must for a visit to Singapore. We went by day and the views are just spectacular over the bay. Would also be stunning at night.,,,
,,!An Architectural Masterpiece,5,,"A beautiful view over Singapore. When we went, it wasn't much crowded even though it was Christmas - New year time. So mostly, at any time of the year, the crowd would be less, considering the fact that all the other attractions in Singapore were heavily crowded. Don't forget to take your cameras along with you. And also, try to go in the night, by around 8, as the skyline would be lit!!",,,
,,Must Experience,5,,Excellent engineering marvel. Conveniently located in the heart of the city. Trip in the day would give a beautiful of the city and I am sure night experience should be equally enjoyable.,,,
,,Pick your day carefully,3,,"It offers great views of the city ... but it is like every other giant ferris wheel in the world. Also, unless the day is super sunny or lit up at night, you might as well take photos in greyscale.",,,
,,Beautiful view !,5,,"The Flyer gives you a 360 Degree view of the city, shoreline etc. boarding is smooth with the staff at every corner to guide you, it has a few restaurants as well but be ready to shell some extra dollars if you eat there.
Disabled friendly and a must visit attraction of Singapore",,,
,,fantastic views,5,,"I have been to Singapore quite a few times, but never on the Flyer. I always thought it was a bit cheesy. but was I wrong - the views were fantastic, and it goes really slowly around for half an hour, so you don't feel like your moving. it was a huge carriage, we had 10 in ours with heaps of room to move around and seating in the middle. next time I want to go in the evening and have the glass of champagne whilst taking in the lights.",,,
,,Nice experience,5,,Went for the late night ride. Amazing view of Singapore. Got a discount on the entry fee by buying a family ticket.,,,
,,Amazing view,5,,If you like to take nice pictures of Singapore city the Singapore flyer is an attraction you should try.,,,
,,Interesting experience but not necessarily the best choice,3,,"Went there for a business meeting. It cost about $30 for a 20 minute ride, but gives you an amazing view of the City state. You have a 360 view of the island which is quite spectacular.

However, there is a cheesy one liner that says that you are at the highest point, which is a blatant lie as there are still buildings that are visibly taller.

You should spend that $30 on a drink which would give you access for the same view, but perhaps from one of the many roof top bars in Singapore.",,,
,,Try Dinner,5,,"The Dinner at flyer is an experience of lifetime specially if u are in a group of family or coleagues. Do book well in advance for peak holiday period and prefer the time that you start in evening while sun is setting, a superb experience.",,,
,,Panoramic view of the City Skyline plus the east,4,,"First off, for those who have height phobia like myself, I'll tell don't be afraid. I've been on the flyer more 3 times at least and each time no fear zero. Why? Becos it's so slow moving...hahaha... And u will have sits in the middle if you still feel little woozy no worries. Can capture great shots of the skyline both day and night depending on what time you visit.",,,
,,great views and a slow gentle ride,5,,great views a slow gentle ride around that provided 360 degree views. Price was not unreasonable for the experience. If your in Singapore its a must do,,,
,,Visual harmony,5,,"Fiona and I both enjoyed the Flyer experience, large comfortable gondolas offer a stunning view of Singapore and surrounds, the wheel travels slowly so you have plenty of time to take in the sights. Definitely worth doing whilst in Singapore",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,"The flyer provides a great view of Singapore, I was there for the F1 and over that weekend it鈥檚 only available for zone 1 ticket holders. Bit of a walk back to zone 1, so leave plenty of time.",,,
,,Great views,5,,We thoroughly enjoyed the ride. It takes about a half an hour to complete and the views of Singapore are great.,,,
,,Great View,5,,Singapore Flyer has a 360 view of the city in singapore. It has dining in the car鈥檚 as well. Great for couples or family or even friends. It鈥檚 a must go to see in Singapore to experience the high view of Singapore.,,,
,,The magnificent spot is the one from the top,5,,"If you want to see the entire Singapore standing at one place, this is your spot! Once you get into the cabin, you can see Singapore from various points in half an hour while the flyer moves around. The magnificent spot is the one from the top!",,,
,,the flyer,5,,thrilling experience in world's highest flyer. too high. but worthy of the risk. gives the entire scenario of the city. miraculous.,,,
,,A good city view,4,,This one has good panormic scenic view of city with the comfort of AC cabins. Best enjoyed at sunset and keep 30 minutes for previsit to flyer. The history of flyer and small previst area is fun for kids and should not be missed.,,,
,,Views from the top,5,,"You can get amazing views of Singapore from the top, especially the marina bay sands. good photography opportunities.",,,
,,A Truly Extraordinary Experience,5,,The 165m Ferris wheel was undoubtedly the highlight of my trip. Definitely recommended for anyone who loves scenery.,,,
,,good sights,4,,Good to see skyline & sights from that view. Dissapointing do not offer combined day & night ticket option,,,
,,Great attraction,5,,The big wheel is a must see when visiting Singapore. The trip on the wheel didn't cost a lot and gave some fantastic views of the city.,,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,This wheel provides great views of Singapore and is a must for all visitors. The cost is well within budget,,,
,,Lights by the night,5,,"Provides a spectacular eagle eye view over the Singapore food district, Gardens by the bay and general cityscape. Slow moving and calm experience. I recommend picking up a layover pack rather than paying for the flyer individually.",,,
,,Beautiful nice view,5,,Over seeing Singapore Marina bay and town. Lighting so beautiful. We all love it! Remember bring along camera to capture the beautiful night view. Amazing!,,,
,,Family Outing,4,,"1. After more than a year, we took the ride again.
2. Compared the last time we are here, it not as crowded. Manage to get a ride within 10min.
3. A鈥檚 usual, the scenery is beautiful, the coastal, Batam Island, a little glimpse of Sentosa & most important, Singapore City Centre.
4. Price are reasonable & it value for money.",,,
,,Excellent views,5,,"Fabulous way to see Singapore. On our visit the weather was clear so we got a clear view of Singapore, the bay area, Clarke quay etc. The ride takes approx 30mins so it isn't rushed with plenty of time to take some photo's and take in the scenery. Even though I've labelled this for young families, it is suitable for all ages and capabilities with plenty of room in the capsules for a wheelchair.",,,
,,Champagne flyer excellent value,5,,"We did the champagne flyer at $79 each. No queue, priority service and a glass of bubbly. We were very lucky and were the only 7pm booking so had the whole capsule to ourselves! The people next to us looked very curious. I鈥檓 giving 5 stars for that alone, but even if we had been in with others I would go 4 or 5 stars as the view was amazing and the 30 min + rotation was perfect time. We went to the skypark after to compare the two and the lines were out the door so gave up and left - the flyer was a definite winner for us tonight!",,,
,,Nice view,4,,THIS is a lovely attraction. It moves very slowly hardly notice the movement. Its about a 30 minutes ride. Would have been if there was audio description details of what you looking at,,,
,,Great views,5,,Not cheap (think it was about 30$) but it is definitely worth it for the amazing views of the skyscrapers and the bay,,,
,,Flyer offers quick view of the skyline,4,,"We did the flyer at dusk and it's a quick way to enjoy Singapore skyline and views.

It's also got dining options which are not bad considering the capsule size is big.

You can just go to marina bay after this as they are quite nearby.",,,
,,the best to see in singapore the cabin very big can the family go all toghter,5,,this flyer price ticket acceptable easy access one round it take 30 minute. you can see the famous hotel in Singapore marina bay . allowed to eat chips potato's and drink water nuts.,,,
,,Nice !,5,,"Its a good way to see Singapore. Incredible views over the island,Best taken 30 minutes before sundown & watch the city come alive after dark.",,,
,,awesome,5,,as my 5 year old nephew kept telling awesome. it was indeed an awesome experience. and a must visit place in Singapore,,,
,,Stamp Land mark of Singapore,3,,"This is almost like our Giant wheel but the entry price is bomb. Its around 3500 per head which is not worth at all. Singapore already has so many tall buildings and malls. From there, you can easily see the whole city and enjoy the beauty. Their is no point in taking this to see the beauty of the city by spending so much.

But we did. We spent around 7000 INR for couple and spent an hour since it rotates very very slow and you cannot feel the rotation easily.

My recommendation: Please don't waste money here unless otherwise its in your must to do list.",,,
,,Beautiful,4,,"Very nice experiencd but expected it to me smaller and more romantic. Was placed in a wagon with children that made a lot of noise. Would recommend them to place families in same and couples in another. But besides that it was worth a ride even tho we needed to wait an hour to go on, because of weather. Must do when you just arrived the city.",,,
,,The View!...,5,,I really love this ride!...the overlooking city view is so amazing!...the staffs are very assistive...,,,
,,It's ok,3,,"Desperately needs an audio tour to know what you are looking at The journey of dreams, still not sure what that was all about! The XD theatre offering half price tickets with entry - still not worth it!!",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Whilst budget travellers may miss out this one it is a really cool view of the city and bay. Around Xmas the queues were negligible.,,,
,,Hop on,5,,The flyer is a lovely attraction. Once you hop on this train that never stops - you hardly feel it move up. It takes about 30-35 minutes to hop in and hop off.,,,
,,Not bad,3,,Overpriced tickets. A one-time thing only. Took it during the day and i can barely see anything. Try to avoid the haze season too! I regretted not riding it during the night as the Singapore night lights will shine upon the waters.,,,
,,Great View of Singapore,5,,"Flyer is situated in the centre of Singapore from where you can see Gardens by the bay ,Marina Bay sands everything and it was worth going for.",,,
,,See Singapore from above,3,,Great way to get a proper perspective of the growing size of Singapore. It rotates so slowly you鈥檇 be able to get wheelchairs or pushers on without too much of a rush. It鈥檚 a lovely leisurely way of enjoying a tourist activity without too much hassle.,,,
,,Very pleasant rotation,5,,"Had initially thought this would be kind of hokey, but my friend wanted to do this and we joined him. About S$30 per adult and you make one rotation. Plenty of time to take in all the sights and great views!

We went in the middle of the afternoon and had the capsule to ourselves. It was excellent!",,,
,,Magic,4,,Superb piece of engineering Amazing vistas Unfortunately we were in a 鈥榗abin鈥?with an extremely loud and roudy bunch of people otherwise it would鈥檝e been a 5/5,,,
,,Marvelous views of Singapore,5,,"Singapore Flyer is located near the Merlion park, beside F1 Racing track. It is among the top attractions.
We had visited during late morning, and the weather was cloudy. Views were amazing the moment we entered the capsule.
Each capsule can have around 15 20 people max. You can also book a capsule for party or dinner.

From the top you can view the Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, Singapore Bay, Skyline of Singapore, Merlion Park.

Go for it!",,,
,,Wow!!!!!,5,,"Such a wonderful view of the city. I'm scared of heights, but the cars are quite large (you stand up and move around) and I felt very safe. And - you see for miles! Even though the day we went was cloudy, still great views. And, cos we were on a Singapire Airlines stopover..... it was free!! Well worth paying for, though.",,,
,,Wheely Big,4,,"This has got to be one of the best views in Singapore. Even if you don鈥檛 ride it, the Flyer is still part of the Singapore skyline. The kids will love it!",,,
,,A mega structure,4,,A beautiful setting for a nightly ride bu was disturbed by rain and lightening. Bit expensive but experience was worthwhile. You will see the beauty of Singapore night setting. Good customer service. Must try day time ride as well.,,,
,,Singapore holiday,5,,This is another must when in Singapore. This wheel is bigger than the London Eye and at its peak you can see all the Singapore harbour.,,,
,,nice views of Singapore,4,,you can get great views of Singapore onboard the Singapore Flyer. it is a bit of a walk from the closest MRT (around 10 mins),,,
,,Have the patience,5,,Unlike the regular giant wheels this Singapore flyer is a giant wheel with a difference.each coupe accomodates approximately 16 people and takes about 30 minutes to complete one round. the assent and the descent are extremely slow and you hardly get the feel of going around except when you see the buildings and the sea around you from greater height. it is something which requires lot of patience and after some time you start to wish that this gets over quickly and you can move around to some other place. photographers definitely enjoy this ride because they get ample time to click all around.,,,
,,Amazing,5,,I have been on this twice even though I am scared of heights. Definitely worth doing . The views are unforgettable. Love it !!!,,,
,,I love the view with Singapore Flyer,5,,"This is 2nd time I come to Singapore Flyer. But this time is first trip to SG for my mother and my son. They love this place. The view was nice and the safety that they provide was good.

Once in the lifetime when you come to Singapore. MUST try Singapore Flyer..",,,
,,Flyer,5,,"My 4 year old daughter got bored, however we had a birds eye view of the city! There is a nice walking, cycling track at walking distance a must to check out.",,,
,,On top of the equator,5,,"Went on the Flyer via the HIPPO hop-on-hop-off ticket. Wow, what a view. We got up the Flyer just before dusk to see Singapore in daylight then into the night cityscape!",,,
,,Still impressive,4,,As long term residents of Singapore we had not been at the flyer in about five years. We went last weekend with our 13 year old boy and 11 year old girl. They have now an exhibition in one of the halls which the kids loved. The ride itself was great. It still is impressive. Price as always is a challenge but if it鈥檚 not too crowded the tide is worth it.,,,
,,to do things in singapore,5,,to do things in singapore takes jst half.n.hr but very good views for pictures and dnt wry abt height and speed,,,
,,What a view,5,,It is worth every penny in your pocket! I've had the best best bestttt experience of watching the whole city from there....although there is a long queue... even if you have a priority pass... so ensure you come on time... also have a priority booking done.,,,
,,Relaxing and Refreshing,5,,"A super treatment for the restless and people in a hurry. Sit back or stand and relax and gaze at the majestic view that the flyer offers. We were lucky since the ride was stopped for an extended period of rain, just after our ride ended. You don't feel the flyer moving and close your mind to other things and take in the beautiful sights that Singapore has to offer.",,,
,,Great attraction in sg,4,,Hey when you visit Singapore you have to try all the attraction s . I lived here for years and didn鈥檛 try this till July on a family holiday . It鈥檚 a must do . We did it at night and weren鈥檛 disappointed as the view of the city was spectacular the only negative was the other people we had in the pod with us they had about 6 small kids with them and they were screaming and very wild which spoilt it for us . If I did this attraction again which I may do in the future I would recommend a private pod and maybe have dinner in the pod to make it special,,,
,,I hate heights,4,,This was a challenge for me as I don't like heights but it is worth getting up there and seeing the city from this height unobstructed.,,,
,,Gives a very good view of the Marina Bay.,3,,"The capsules were nice and big. However, the number of people exceeded the number of seats. That lead to some rush among the people who wanted to sit for sometime. Also, the overall experience is not as immersing as London Eye and it starts getting boring after you have reached the top, as it feels too slow as there is nothing much to see. A good experience for people who have not taken a ride on London Eye or something similar.",,,
,,Slow,5,,Well i come there with my friend and we love the place. The flyer took about 45 minutes to finish and its quiet boring inside there.,,,
,,Fantastic view,5,,"This is a must whilst in Singapore. We went early when the flyer firsts opens at 8.30am and there was no crowds and we had a pod to ourselves - which was awesome. The view is fantastic and gives great photo opportunities. Prior to boarding the wheel there is a section outlining the history, which is worth taking the time to look at. We also found that the gift shop that you must walk through at the end is not overpriced as you might find in some other countries. Enjoy!",,,
,,Night View Better Compare to Day time,4,,"I go with my friends on Saturday night, it only take 30 min to complete the circle. But there got a exhibition space to before we go into the flyer, we spend some time there to read and understand how the Singapore Flyer is build and it is the tallest flyer in the world before 2014. We enjoy the view inside and I notice the flyer is wheelchair friendly.

At level one of the flyer building have food court, so we have some dinner",,,
,,Great views,5,,"The flyer was easy to get to and reasonably priced, it wasn't busy when we went but still efficient, staff all helpful",,,
,,Perfect for couple !,4,,"It is a national landmark of the country, and you wouldnt want to miss it.
Some may find it a little bit boring, but as for couple like us, we having some great time while taking the ride. Take a look at the amazing city view, spent some time, slowing down the pace, and having lil chat with each other.

A good place for the couple, and maybe for the family with children too.",,,
,,Experience matters.,5,,The best place to get a view of this beautiful Singapore City. For half an hour or so we would be inside a cell with other visitors like us but a must to experience. We visited in the night and I recommend the same to ither visitors too. The city looks beautiful in the night specially when you see it from the top.,,,
,,Very impressive,4,,Easy to find and we found the staff helpful we did go early in the day so we only had 8 of us in the pod. This makes a huge difference to comfort as we were leaving it looked crowded and hardly enough seats. The view was fabulous and impressive.,,,
,,Great for Singapore Bay view,5,,A great idea created so that you can see the most of Singapore Bay region. Located near the Marina Bay you see a great sight ...specially in evenings,,,
,,Awestruck,5,,We visited this place as a part of our Singapore trip and just loved it . The flyer is really awesome for the view. The ticket costs 33$ per person and is worth it. The flyer moves really slowly without the people coming to know of it moving - making it good for kids and people with motion sickness as well.,,,
,,A Must See,4,,We had only 5 hours in Singapore ... So we decided to try the flyer during our short time. the ticket was expensive. but we were in Singapore and we had to go there. It is the second biggest after London eye. we were about 12 people in the cabin. My advise: do not forget to take a good camera with yourself. specially for taking Time-Lapse.,,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,A great place to see superb view of Singapore. When we went it was also a brilliant place to just spend 40 minutes to slow down and take in Singapore.,,,
,,Good if you like city views and/or for young children,4,,"This is pretty interesting if you have a good camera with zoom to capture various interesting sights which you will be able to see from the top.

Children young enough to be excited and old enough to know what is going on will like this.

It is however quite pricey, so it is not recommended for people who do not like scenery and views. This is not a roller coaster ride, it is a slow moving Ferris wheel.",,,
,,NOT REALLY WORTH IT,2,,"Unless you have lots of time and money, the Flyer, is not a TOP choice. It's slow, expensive and the view can been seen from many buildings. I would pass.",,,
,,Pleasant view of Singapore and surrounds,3,,"The Singapore Flyer is a national landmark of the modern Singapore skyline and deserves the recognition for that. On a clear day you can see out towards the Indonesian islands but it is nothing truly breathtaking. The flyer does give a good view of the bay but you could get that same view or better from one of the high rise eating establishments around the bay. Done the flyer, fun, but wouldn't bother to do it again.",,,
,,Good views but a bit boring,3,,"This is quite expensive and a bit boring thing to do. You can see Singapore from high up but on the other hand, the window's were dirty so the view was not so good.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,4,,Worth doing when in Singapore. 30 min ride . Other attractions like flight Simulator and 6d cinematic experience also in the same complex,,,
,,A place you can鈥檛 miss to visit when in Singapore,5,,"Perfect place to have a perfect view of the entire city of Singapore, the best time to visit this place is during the night so you can see the entire city lit up , putting up some pictures of the view from this place and trust me you will regret if you don鈥檛 visit this place.",,,
,,Great views!,5,,"Perhaps a bit on the expensive side however great views from it. Also right beside the F1 track, grid and pits which you can go for a walk on. We didn't realise the track was there until we saw it from the wheel.",,,
,,Great wheel,5,,Fantastic views of Singapore - recommend visiting during the F1 if you're in town but otherwise still good viewing.,,,
,,Nothing nearby except the flyer,2,,"We came here to have a walk round the promenade etc. Well the actual promenade was closed and there was literally nothing at all to see here, except for the flyer. It's also around a 10 minute walk once you get off the MRT. Not too bad but unless you want to go on the flyer, don't bother going.",,,
,,Great Views,5,,The Singapore Flyer is easy to get on and off for any ages. Excellent view of the city and the bay area. We were going on a cruise the next day so we could see where the ship would be docked. There are a variety of restaurants and gift shops in the complex. Well worth a visit. Takes about 20 - 25 mins to go around once.,,,
,,Great view.,5,,The Singapore Flyer was well worth the $70+ we paid to go up in. It takes about 25 minutes to go around once so you get to see and take lots of photos of the city and the bay area. We were going on a cruise the next day so we could see where our ship would be berthed. The complex had plenty of resturants and was easy to find the toilets. Taxis were also easy to get afterwards.,,,
,,Dinner with an unforgettable view,4,,"Whilst we didn't have dinner here (in truth, we didn't know it had dinner packages), this was our 3rd visit to the 'global flyer/eye/Ferris wheel' network. Truly remarkable views!",,,
,,Must go place,5,,Anyone who visits Singapore should take a ride on the flyer. Its very safe for children and for the elderly. Its a 30 minutes ride where you can see the whole of singapore. Recommended to go at night so you can see the lights,,,
,,Sky views to die for,4,,I really only took this ride as it seemed the thing to do. I wasn鈥檛 expecting a great deal... seen one giant Ferris wheel seen em all. I was wrong! What a spectacular way to see an amazing city. Took about half an hour but we really got a snap shot of Singapore.,,,
,,A must visit when you come to Singapore,5,,"Yes, this attraction quite expensive. But there are many ways to get dicaounted price.
You must try ride this during daylight and night.
For me night time is the best.
We can see Singapore as city of light.
Yes they have dinner on the flyer, but for me it is too expensive.",,,
,,Dinner on the Flyer,5,,"There is an option to have a meal on the flyer in the evenings. It is well worth doing as the view is really good at night. The cost is high for a four course meal, but the location makes it worth doing. The staff were very friendly and helpful.",,,
,,It is slow and smooth,5,,You can eat dinner on it at a very high price. The views are wonderful. It is walkable from the downtown area.,,,
,,Peaceful ride to enjoy the view,5,,Lovely way to enjoy the view song the Singapore River. It's very peaceful in the cars and show moving. Takes about half an hour to complete the circuit.,,,
,,Nice experience,3,,"The view from the flyer is very nice, the only thing is that it takes half an hour to complete a full cycle. When going with kids, please make sure they go for the toilets before. Price not fully justify the experience.",,,
,,"Nice experience, still kept its charm after a long time",5,,"It has been about eight years since the last time I visited the Singapore flyer when it first opened to the public. While I cannot remember much from the first visit to compare, I must say that I enjoyed this visit just as much as the previous one.

We went on a Saturday night, and while there was a fair amount of tourists and locals, the queue at the standard ticket booth moved quite fast. The cabin was not too packed as well when we boarded. The ride was 30 minutes long, which means that you have plenty of time to enjoy and take in the sights.

Even though the experience was pretty seamless for us, we did notice that the queue and crowd started to build up when we were leaving the place. I would recommend going for the special packages such as the Singapore Sling flight and champagne flight if you want to have a more personalized check-in process and not having to wait in line.

On a side note, we had a glimpse of the sky dining flight, and we counted about 5-6 tables inside the cabin. It seems like it is not such a private and exclusive experience as it claims. So you might want to take note of this if you are thinking to go for the sky dining experience.",,,
,,A Birds eye view of the city,4,,"unfortunately it was raining a little when we went for our trip on the flyer, but never letting a little thing like that spoil our fun and as it wasn't at all busy and we were lucky enough to have the pod all to ourselves. You really do get a great view from the flyer from the Gardens by the bay right across the city, not to mention the Birds Eye View of the Formula 1 Circuit (well parts of it).

Well worth the money for such a spectacular view over the city",,,
,,photo lover?you can here nicely,4,,its move so slow but enjoy watching entire singapore.i fee its worth go with family dont be suprise its finished a full round without you felted.,,,
,,The View!!,5,,"On a clear day .....you can see forever! This was written for the Singapore Flyer! You can literally see for miles, and the Flyer does not go so fast that you miss seeing anything. As you get higher you get a completely different ascent of the scenery,
- make sure you have your camera fully loaded!",,,
,,Best view in Singapore,5,,"The tickets were a bit pricey for this kind of activity, but the view of the city is worth it. We went during the day, but would probably be better in the evening! Great view for photos, you can take your time as it is turning slowly.",,,
,,PERFECT,4,,It was very very nice and beautiful! very quick ticket and the view of the town of singapore was perfect!,,,
,,Well Worth A Visit,5,,"Spectacular views all round. Not cheap at $33 per adult. Great way to see how unique the city of Singapore is, just wonderful. Can only imagine what it is like at night time.",,,
,,Best to look from a distance,3,,"While the flyer looks great from a far and adds charm to Singapore's CBD, the ride is pretty dull unless you are there for dining. Being completely enclosed in the capsule, taking good pictures also is difficult because of the reflections from glass. Overall great view from outside, can avoid the ride though.",,,
,,Best in Evening,4,,"In sunset time view was awesome.We could see all tall building at once.If you visit Singapore,you should visit that place. The garden area was good for relax. Good for all ages.",,,
,,A ripper of an experience!,5,,This was the highlight of our day. There were no queues so we were on very quickly. We loved the great views as we went up and down. The wheel itself is an interesting engineering feat too! YMMV,,,
,,must visit at day and night,4,,"i will recommed for day as well as night, bcoz at day time i had visited this its clear view can be seen, but at night view it may be good",,,
,,Great way to see the skyline,5,,We went in the afternoon on this but suspect that early evening as the sun is setting would be a nicer view over th city,,,
,,Can see the best of Singapore,5,,It's a nice attraction. Loved the fact that you can see all of Singapore. The top view of Gardens by the bay and Marina Bay sands is lovely. Its is a must visit attraction!,,,
,,360 degree view,5,,"So we visited the Singapore Flyer on a noon, calm and peaceful- purchased tickets on the spot and there wasn't much crowd so we spent a good time having a great view of Singapore. Well maintained and a must visit. There are food outlets where we can grab some quick good food.keep up the good work cheers !!!",,,
,,Very slow,3,,"Not for everyone, but it offers good city views - we went at night and its great to get your bearings but travels just a bit too slowly! Some people may love this, small to medium kids get a bit impatient.",,,
,,A view of Singapore from above,4,,"The Singapore Flyer travels very slowly so you get a chance to really lock onto a sight and take all the photos you want without it moving on before you are finished. Also because it travels so slowly there is no sensation of movement for those who get motion sickness. The capsules are air conditioned which is a bonus in Singapore, so the 30 minutes spent on the Flyer is very comfortable.
Worth the money, and it's worth doing in the daytime and at night.",,,
,,Try the flyer for great views of the city!,5,,"We decided to go at night and I'm glad we did. The views were amazing. You can get similar views from the Marina Bay Sands roof, but this perspective is unique. We were concerned about the wait (we went on a FRI night, but it wasn't bad at all. I think we waited about 15 minutes and part of that is just due to loading the cars. Each giant ""capsule"" holds 12-20 people. When we were there, they were loading about 12 in each one because it wasn't too crowded. Some cars are for private dinners and are set up with tables, so they just went right on by the loading platform as they must not have been booked.
Under the Flyer, there are eating and shopping opportunities but we did not try anything.
Once you get in, there is glass all around on the ""cylinder"" shaped car. The views are very good. I think this is the 2nd or 3rd tallest in the world. It's taller than the London Eye. You go up roughly 540 feet. The ride does one rotation (takes about 30 minutes), so enjoy each view at each elevation as you will only be there once! The car moves ""away"" from the City first, so you move up slowly on the ""back side"" with better views to the north. As you come up over the peak, you get amazing unobstructed views of the skyline. We really enjoyed this attraction and would recommend it for sure. The night views were really spectacular. There is a good gift store at the end. We bought a great wood wall art piece and a tee shirt there for our daughter.",,,
,,Worth it,5,,As with lots of things in Singapore it鈥檚 not cheap ($33 per adult) but it鈥檚 certainly worth it for the stellar views of what is one of the most beautiful modern cities of the world,,,
,,One of the best experience in singapore.,5,,"By far one of the best Singapore has to offer, a must do for all travellers its worth both your time and money, below the flyer there are small cafes and jogging track by they river side, it's a beautiful place to be with family. Can spend quality time with your loved ones .",,,
,,View from top of flyer,4,,"We had been to Singapore for business visit but had a spare day for site seeing & we selected flyer for visit. Being odd day,there was no rush & we rode flyer in no time. Once it went to top,views were great- hotel,sea,skyline - all were unbelievable & one has to see it to believe.
The ride was completed in 45 minutes & it was not expensive.
Cab back to hotel was bit difficult to get & it took 45 minutes to get it. The button for calling the taxi at taxi stand was not working",,,
,,Must Go.,5,,The Singapore Flyer is great and a fantastic view. Go earlier in morning as there are no lines. We arrived when it opened and was on the flyer in 5 minutes.,,,
,,Great experience as a business group,5,,Great to have a look over the city and such a great experience. Singapore is a gorgeous city that you can miss. This is a really one time only need experience but needs to be done,,,
,,Should do it,4,,It is one of those things you should do. We were lucky enough to have it as part of our F1 ticket package. You get a great view of the layout of Singapore. Takes about 40 mins or so. Worth doing.,,,
,,Amazing view,5,,amazing view of whole Singapore. Trust me if not let down by rains best time to visit is dusk time.. from 6:30 to 7:15pm..,,,
,,Awesome view,4,,"It really is worth visiting as the slow rotation of the flyer allows time to admire the scenery of Singapore:) The scenery is the most beautiful at night, where there's lights everywhere. This is accessible for wheelchairs or strollers and is definitely and insta-worthy spot!",,,
,,A Fascinating sight in the Singapore skyline,4,,"Worth paying SGD 33 for the ride. just to get a birds eye view of Singapore. However, thanks to the vagaries of Singapore's weather (the skyline is cloudy most of the time) you very rarely get to see distant locations like Johor in Malaysia",,,
,,A Beautiful Experience ....,5,,We initially thought that it is some kind of a roller coaster but though it looks like it the experience is totally different .. It was not crowded either .. The evening time was perfect to be on the flyer .. You get a beautiful view of SIngapore with teh Marina Bay right in front of it .. An experience of a lifetime .. would definitely do again in my next visit too ..,,,
,,Nice,4,,The local big wheel Nice view on Marina Nay Sand It s convenient for all ages They propose different package for special dinner or event if you want do your wedding demand ! Why not,,,
,,What a view!,5,,"I鈥檝e done the Cape Town wheel, London eye- this is truly spectacular. As large and high as the London eye and worth it, especially at night to see the view. Loved it and would do again!",,,
,,Rilexs Trip,5,,"best vacation and best view for holiday. Expensive but aleardy pay for this atraction... just to bad for fotograph station after we play flyer, they can't bring good attitude and smile",,,
,,Great way to see Singapore.,5,,"A must do attraction in singapore, this ride lasts for about 30 mins view of singapore that will take your breath away. A different perspective than the city below make you see the whole beauty of this city and some of it's well known unique architectural buildings. Bring your friends and family and bask take it all in when you're ""on top of the world""",,,
,,Great view,5,,"We were expecting to queue for a while to get on, but the attraction was not busy, after paying , a discount is given for using a Mastercard, we boarded and slowly rose to enjoy the view.
Having been on the ""London Eye"" I can say that this wheel is noticeably larger, and the views over Singapore impressive.
Visiting at dusk would be the preferred.",,,
,,Flyer trip,5,,We lucked in and arrived at around 2pm on a Saturday and were prepared to wait. No such wait and walked straight on! We only shared with two others. View is superb! Well worth it!,,,
,,Don't bother going up,3,,Pretty to look at but not worth spending money to ride on. Better to go to the club lounge in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. You have to pay but can redeem the money against food or drink and get a better view than from the flyer.,,,
,,Good half hour spent,4,,Staff were efficient and friendly. No clear signs for the payment counters as some were closed and we had to find our way to those that were opened.,,,
,,It is worth it,5,,Nice to have a look over all Singapore from up. I love it. But if it raining. It is stopping automatically so chech the weAther before.,,,
,,Nice view but very slow,3,,Certainly a good way to see Singapore but it moves very slowly so it starts to drag a bit particularly you have kids with you. Definitely not a flyer!,,,
,,Flying high,5,,"A magnificent view of the city and surrounds. Goes every so slow, you have a lot of time to look. Better at night but good in the day too.",,,
,,Excellent,4,,"Recommended to go between evening time to night, where the buildings start to slowly light up. Nice tourist attraction too. Suitable of all ages",,,
,,Great views of singapore,5,,Walked to singapore flyer from our hotel 20 minutes. Used our sia card for tickets. Not very busy so no line up or waiting. Night views are fantastic with various buildings changing colours as we went around. Takes about 35 minutes but worth the visit,,,
,,Nice views,4,,"Worth a visit, as it provides a leisurely view of Singapore and surrounds. Marvel at the ships awaiting their docking times as far as the eye can see, to the City views.",,,
,,Must visit while in Singpaore,4,,Beautiful way to see one of the greatest and beautiful skyline in world. From the Marina Bay Sands to The Fullerton Bay. You even get to see the F1 Pit building which is right next to the Singapore Flyer. A beautiful view at night when the whole city lights up. The staff have are smiles and happly want to show you their city. Great way to start your night out on the weekends.,,,
,,Just the right amount of time,4,,The length of time was considerable but the space was large enough for 4 kids and 6 adults walking around taking photos,,,
,,Super amazing view,5,,One of the best views of the world 28 min ride is super crazy can't wait to ride again fun filled activity super ride. Amazing ride tou don't feel a thing in it it's very normal when you reach up and come down,,,
,,Great view of the city,4,,"The Singapore flyer is always a nice thing to do. If you go during daytime, there is nearly no queue",,,
,,Best wheel in the world,5,,"We always go on a wheel wherever we are in the world in order to get a panoramic view.
Well this wheel is more of a trip than a wheel.
There are a lot of other things to do as well as the wheel.
However this is about the wheel itself and it's capsules are big and spacious and air conditioned.
The views from the wheel are amazing and you don't get the feeling of being rushed that you do on other wheels",,,
,,Spectacular views of Singapore skyline,5,,"The 360 degree spectacular views of Singapore skyline and the paddock of Formula 1 racing track. There is also a logo of Singapore Airlines on the grid.
The ticket price is SGD 33 per adult.
We went on Singapore Flyer on my wife's birthday. This was part of a very special day to us.",,,
,,Give it a spin!,4,,"The Flyer offers an uninterrupted panoramic view of Singapore city and harbour - so many ships lining up. We went early in the day and missed any crowds and queues. A spin around takes half an hour and the experience would be greatly enhanced by an auditory commentary. You are basically left to work out landmarks and features for yourself.

One thing we did notice was the haze and viewing could be worse on rainy days. I should imagine a night viewing could be quite spectacular. We used the Hop On Hop Off bus to arrive and depart. That made access quite easy.

There are also some food outlets on site, where we first tasted kopi - Singapore coffee. There is also a very pleasant garden area and pond on the ground floor. This enhances the setting of the Flyer.

At $33, the Singapore Flyer is not cheap, but it does give you a good view of the local area.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,I visited in september 2017 .There was no crowd at this place.One must take this ride if you want to have a fantastic view of Singapore. The view changes several times during 30 minutes ride .The speed is very slow so for those who have motion sickness can also ride.Please note the flyer is not for thrill but for view.,,,
,,Super City View,5,,Spend peaceful time with your loved ones along with some great view of the city. Keep clicking pictures.,,,
,,Slow and Steady Visuals of Singapore,5,,"Worth experiencing it once if you go to Singapore. The flyer gives a magnificent view of all around Singapore, gardens by the bay on one side, marina bay sands and the city view on the other. We went on a day which was not so crowded hence we could fully relax in our pod.",,,
,,Great View of the City...but Spendy,3,,"I'm a world traveler who loves theme parks, rides, and silly touristy activities. I have now ridden 9 of the 10 tallest observation wheels in the world, so riding the Singapore Flyer with my fiancee last month when we were in Singapore was a no-brainer!

When you ride so many of these observation wheels around the world, you begin to notice that the experience is virtually identical each time. The only thing that truly differs is the view...and the Singapore Flyer doesn't disappoint in the view it offers! At 541 feet tall, it is (as of November, 2017) the second tallest observation wheel in the world, dwarfed only by 9 feet between it and the World's Tallest Wheel, the High Roller in Las Vegas.

First off, if you're afraid of heights, don't be afraid to ride the Flyer. I have a strong fear of heights (which is funny, because I love riding roller coasters and other tall rides!), yet I experienced no fear during my trip around the Flyer. In our car was another woman who was DEATHLY afraid of heights and she ended up enjoying her ride as well. It takes approximately 30 minutes to complete a full rotation, but the wheel moves so slowly that you can barely feel it moving. The cabins (or capsules as they are sometimes called on other wheels) are large, spacious, secure, and offer ample views in all directions, as well as up and down. A ride at sunset offers spectacular views of the waning sunlight as the city powers up its nighttime lighting for a lovely view that is completely different at the end of the ride as it is the beginning. Each cabin is air-conditioned to provide a respite from the sweltering Singapore heat and humidity.

Once you have completed your voyage, you--as always--exit through the gift shop. In the gift shop, you can view the picture they took of you before your flight (in front of a green screen) nicely composited in front of a wide variety of backgrounds. You can buy different packages of these photos. Additionally, there are t-shirts, key chains, refrigerator magnets, shot glasses, and other souvenirs offered for not only the Singapore Flyer, but also the country and city of Singapore.

If you're a tourist visiting Singapore, go do the Flyer if you've never ridden it before. Yeah, it's pricey and a little out of the way, but cabs are reasonable and public transportation is cheap and efficient. If you're staying at the Marina Bay Sands, the Singapore Flyer is within walking distance across the river.

Enjoy!",,,
,,Awesome views,5,,What a fantastic view you get from this magnificent giant observation wheel. 360 degree views of the awesome city of Singapore. I would definitely recommend to family and friends.,,,
,,Overview,4,,"We were there when it opened and as there were no queues we walked straight through all of the pre-ride exhibition. We had a capsule to ourselves which meant we could wander around as we liked. It offered a good view of the skyline and the Marina Bay area. Couldn鈥檛 see things in the distance, due to haze.",,,
,,Iconic Singapore,5,,The Singapore Flyer is a must do for the tourist. The flyer is such a beautiful structure that it is very much associated with Singapore. Try to see the different views during the day and night and this is definitely an awesome place for some beautiful pictures. The ticket prices are expensive but it is definitely money well-spent.,,,
,,Great views,4,,"Great views at the biggest attractions in Singapore. However, it gets very hot inside the cabins and since they move very slowly not everyone takes it well. We took some great pictures inside and have good memories from there.",,,
,,Bird Eye View,5,,"A loverly flyer just like London Eye, provide bird's eye view of whole Singapore moving at slow space.",,,
,,Birds eye view,5,,Well worth a visit the flyer gives a birds eye view and is very comfortable. Would recommend to get a grasp on the city at the start of a trip.,,,
,,What a View!!!!,5,,"So hight up, but it isnt in the least bit unnerving! I was quite apprehensive to go on the Singapore Flyer but I neednt have worried, it was a very slow moving trip and I was too interested in the view to take notice of actually how high up I was! It is very well priced for an attraction, and I definitely recommend going just before sunset - the views are amazing!!!!",,,
,,Must do for Tourists,4,,"A nice place to visit after dinner (Chinatown) as it's closeby. Great night views of the Singapore skyline / Marina Bay Sands, and after visiting the shops, there's the Satay Club for supper,",,,
,,"Great views, but expensive",4,,"There was only 6 people in our capsule so we could see very well.
I think it went for about 45 mins so plenty of opportunity to see everything and take photos
I timed it perfectly by accident. Sun was up then went down so we got the night lights also. Was very quiet on a Wed night
It鈥檚 $33SGN which I think is very expensive. Especially if it was crowded I would have been annoyed. But a good experience",,,
,,Over rated,3,,Can get the same or better view from Marina Bay Sands Deck. It's nice but We thought it was over rated.,,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,A very good way to see the sights of Singapore from a different perspective. Very efficient and friendly staff. Overall a good experience.,,,
,,Expensive but good views,4,,The views are lovely but can be a bit claustrophobic. Also seats are limited leading to a long stand.,,,
,,What a view by sun set!!,5,,Singapore Flyer allows you to have a magnificent view at the Singapore skyline and Marina Bay Sands. Best time to visit here will be around 6:15 pm to 6:45 pm as we can see the sun set and the buildings being lit up. A timelapsed video will keep the memory forever!! :),,,
,,Watch the sunset from the flyer,4,,"The flyer looks so beautiful against the Singapore skyline. But an even amazing experience is to actually get on it. The capsules move every minute and go a full circle in about 30 mins. I recommend getting on it right before sunset, so you can watch the sun go down and get great views of the city and the sea going up in the flyer and then watch the Singapore skyline light up as it gets dark and you come down. It is an amazing experience. They also offer dining and other experiences, if you're interested.",,,
,,Magnificent view,5,,Get a panoramic view from this landmark structure. Avoid weekends. The prices are a bit high but its worth it.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,It's one of my favorite place in Singapore. You have to be here to see the changing of Singapore by night. it was marvellous and Great chance to visit the Singapore city.enjoyed lot.Afternoon time is good according to me as there have good sunrise in whole area.Singapore weather is unpredictable .So choose sunny time if you need to get a best photo shoot,,,
,,Amazing view at night,4,,"Great view amazing lighting always preference to go at evening, i think its bit expensive and they should add audio/ video for information about how Singapore was developed that will be great",,,
,,Great Experience,5,,"We did the review late afternoon and had a very clear day. As there were 5 of us we had a capsule all to ourselves. It is airconditioned, and very roomy so you can walk around and take pics from all angles. There is plenty of bench seating if you just want to sit and take in the view. You will get great views of Singapore Harbour from the large ships sitting in the bay, beautiful views of Marina Bay Sands hotel. This was a better experience than the London Eye. We did not have to wait and were able to get straight on. We went on a Sunday afternoon. My camera worked fine through the glass.",,,
,,Worth taking a ride,4,,"From Downtown hotel area, taxi ride was no more than 10-15 min.

About the same size as the London Eye. Based on my recollection, capsules are about the same size. Views are very different. View of London view is much more impressive than view of Singapore from the Flyer.

The city landscape of Singapore only has a few landmarks. The Mariner Bay Sands, The Garden by the Bay (2 huge greenhouses) and downtown financial district are pretty much it.

Having said that, still a local tourist spot to spend a couple of hours.",,,
,,Fab view of Marina,5,,Went on the Flyer as part of a night tour from cruise ship. I thought it was great. Fab views of the Marina and surrounding Bay Area. Clearly weather dependent. We went at 9pm and there was no queue. Think it normally costs 33 Singapore dollars per adult.,,,
,,The highest Flyer,5,,"Is one of many attraction in Singapore with excelent service and nice view.all the cabins is window cabin , you can see all around,the half country, the sea, the some smalsl islands, is situated in marina bay, you feel like in air,in parashute.is take about 20-30minute, is little expensive about 30sgd, but is good price for Singapore.for people who want to see all is better to take same promotion include many attractions tickets, you pay for all and after you don't need to wait in queues and you spent less.",,,
,,Great view,5,,"This is larger than the London Eye, I would do his during the day and enjoy the city view at daytime.",,,
,,Brilliant views of Singapore,5,,"This is a great experience, good views of the city and loads of photo opportunities. It takes about half an hour for the wheel to do one full circuit.",,,
,,Best veiw in town,4,,Perfect way to see the sites and orientate yourself with the city... great veiws and resonable value given the time it takes to go round... there is an intro and few things to see as you make your way to the wheel but with an impatient 3 year old didnt really add any value... perfect outing on a nice day and easy to access across road from promanard mrt station....,,,
,,First option,5,,We visited this in the first day and it was a smart move Showed us the layout of the city It takes 30 minutes and only $32 Well spend and air conditioning in capsules,,,
,,"Engineering marvel, exceptionally managed, not scary at all !",5,,"It makes perfect sense to add this to the City tour itinerary as travelling from point to point in Singapore is quite expensive. Marina Bay sands appears to be right across the street to walk, but is a 1.5km distance. So if you have old people or young kids plan accordingly to bring the cab right at the entrance of the Singapore Flyer.
Engineered to excite and thrill , but without the scare of typical flying wheels. The cubes are made of solid steel and glass. Through out the rotation and while at various heights you never feel unsafe or dizzy. Rotates at a snail's pace to give you loads of time to look around and click pictures etc.. The only times one has to pay attention or a little caution is when stepping in and out of the cubes. The Flyer continues to move and is not halted for boarding or deboarding. Must do while in Singapore. Haven't been in the London Eye. So can't compare.",,,
,,Awesome Views,5,,This is a great way to see Singapore. It is a very professional and smooth ride with friendly staff. Views are awesome. They even have exclusive dinner options!,,,
,,Ferris wheel overlooking marina,3,,The ride took about 30 min. The wheel previously turned in anticlockwise direction suffered bleak business. But with change of direction in clockwise the business seemed improved. This is belief in fengshui to receive the good energy from marina and discharge in other direction.,,,
,,30 Mins of Amazing View,4,,"It can be boring time to be in a capsule for 30 mins but if visited during sunset its one of the best views you can get of the city.. i was lucky to be on that time and enjoyed a lot .. blue sky, skyscrapers, and the colours .. loved it",,,
,,Replica of London's eye,4,,"Yeah, it is a replica of London's eye but taller than it. In fact, it is the world's highest observation desk. A wonderful view of the whole of Singapore.",,,
,,Sights of Singapore,5,,A relaxing way to see the sights of Singapore from above. We were very fortunate not to have a full pod - we shared with a family and it was good. Just wath out for the tour guides assuming you are one of their sheep that need to be yelled at! if tourgroups could be separated it would be more pleasant for the others using the Flyer,,,
,,Really enjoyed this observation wheel trip,5,,"We have tried this Ferris wheel trip in the morning about 10 am when there were almost no people around so enjoyed the privacy in the cabin. The tour starts with the augmented reality show how the Ferris wheel has been built, comparison with another iconic observation wheels from around the world and family photo shoot, then continued with the observation part, luckily the weather was good so we could see most of the city centers landmarks. Highly recommended if you are not afraid of heights and have passion for Ferris wheels",,,
,,Complete View of Singapore city,5,,Visited in the afternoon hence it wasn't that crowded. The tour if for 30 mins where you see the whole of Singapore city from the top. Very comfortable cabins which can accommodate more than 15 people.,,,
,,Highest in the sky,4,,"Very huge circular structure,it's known for the highest flyer in the world. It's safe and secure,with panoramic view observation capsules. Good service and not so expensive fare,it's the must try when in Singapore.",,,
,,Not so impressive,3,,"I looked at many reviews and pics on the internet and went with hope that the flyer wad as good as in the picture. However, it's far from my imagination. Not that impressive",,,
,,If pre-ordered it's the best!,4,,Amazing view and that's what you pay for. The food is good but mainly the view attracts. Remember do pre-order three courses and enjoy the ride!,,,
,,Nice view especially at night,4,,Get ready your camera for all the good shots. Go and visit the viewing deck to view from top. Taking MRT and alighting at Bayfront is nearer.,,,
,,What a view,5,,"Worth a visit by day and night. We only did a day ride, but the lights at night would be spectacular!",,,
,,The slow flyer that takes you high!,5,,"This one is a good thing to go for if you wanna catch the entire skyline of Singapore at a time and is best done late evening.

We went for this after our visit to Gardens by the Bay, around 8:30 which is towards the end of the operating hours for this attraction and seemed perfect.

It takes roughly 20-30 mins for one full circle and the entire time is totally worth it!",,,
,,Must try,5,,Singapore Flyer is one of the attraction you must not missed. Best time to go is around 4-6pm and if the sky is clear you can see the entire Marina Bay Sand area. Its comparable to the london eye but even better,,,
,,Great views,4,,We did do the flyer more for my husband and because we were there but was suprised that it was enjoyable with great views well worth doing,,,
,,Amazing,5,,First time on such a ride . Must see for the hall family . An atracion i woulldnt miss . Grate view . 33 singapore dolars an adult .,,,
,,wonderful view,5,,"in about 30 min see Singapore from above. close to Hotel the Sands and look where once a year the F1 racing is, Great just do it ;)",,,
,,One of the greatest attractions of Singapore,5,,A lovely experience on the flyer. We were in the flyer when it was raining heavily. But still the flyer operated smoothly Amazing views.. The location of the flyer is also great,,,
,,Great view,5,,We have been up twice now and the view is fantastic you get a great view of all the ships at sea anchored out and the famous marina bay sands building which we have been up to and the gardens by the bay park . It鈥檚 great to go up day and nite time,,,
,,Awesome views,5,,If you want to see all Singapore has to offer ?!? Then this is definitely a must!!! The views you can see from this is utterly amazing!! Well worth the price,,,
,,High fun,5,,"We were the only people in the car, it was a great day. You could see forever at the top. Found it a bit pricey but worth it. The ground are very well kept. Nice visit.",,,
,,Amazing view,4,,"The view offered from the flyer is very much worth the price of admission (pretty expensive). The uninterrupted vista across the city and out over the harbour is just amazing

The flyer is huge (165 odd metres) & the cabins are spacious (our daughter ran laps inside it...)

For a very unique perspective of the city this is a definite must do activity",,,
,,Great experience!!,4,,"Got it included with our singapore stopover program. Great fun to see the sights especially at night with kids.
Only thing unpleasant thing was the security guy who scans the bags, not sure what his issue was but he needs a snickers or some customer service training. Lost one star just because of his attitude.",,,
,,Worth a visit!,5,,"Singapore Flyer gives a bird's view of the city. And its a big cell where only 6-10 ppl will be allowed. You can get a view of the Gardens, Skypark, Esplanade, Boat quay, F1 track etc. If you're a 1st time visitor to SGP then I would suggest you to visit the Flyer.

Nearest MRT to Flyer is Promenade Station. 5 mins walk from the station to Flyer.",,,
,,Nice but pricey,4,,"Felt like it took a long long time to get to the top but the view was worth it. Good view of the marina bay area and iconic buildings like Marina Bay Sands and Esplanade. I love the views at night but I imagine it would be nice to visit durimg sunset too.

Ticket for the half hour ride was rather pricey at $33 for adult and $21 for kid. There was a discount with krisflyer acct when we were there.",,,
,,Awesome View,5,,You get to see whole Singapore view and its good to fly in the flyer which moves very slow and you can enjoy the view all around..,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"A nice way to see the skyline of singapore is to have a look from the Singapore Flyer. Located conveniently near the Raffles Avenue, Singapore Flyer is a ride which takes around 30 mins for the complete rotation. The best time is to visit during night time when the whole of singapore is illuminated..",,,
,,Spectacular Views,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a great way to catch some nice views of Singapore!
The capsules are large, holding up to 28 people, there are benches in the center of the capsule but you will most likely be standing and changing positions to view the changing scenery.The views are spectacular, you can literally see for miles, the capsules and the glass are kept clean so you can take some good photos.
Overall: It was a cool experience",,,
,,Birds Eye View of Singapore,4,,Singapore Flyer gives a birds eye view of Singapore in a comfortable atmosphere. Tourists get to move one round of the flyer. You may also book a space for evening dinner in the flyer cubicles.,,,
,,Experience the lights!,5,,Very nice view on top of this Singapore Flyer best to step into the car at about 6.30pm or 6.45pm as you will see it differently from a broad daylight to the night lights from the city. Get ready your camera and enjoy the ride!,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,Our family had a great time on our visit to the Singapore Flyer. We had pre-purchased gift vouchers that we were easily able to convert to tickets. We did the evening tour which was great to view the harbour lit up at night. We would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore.,,,
,,Fascinated,4,,Singapore flyer is a must when in Singapore - it will give you a bird's eye view of the place and be fascinated of how this little country's government have planned its beautification,,,
,,The biggest ferris wheel in Asia & the second biggest in the world.,5,,"Overlooking Marina Bay and the Singapore River, at 165 metres it is 30 m taller than the London Eye and ony 2.6 m smaller than the High Roller in Las Vegas. The location is great and is within easy walking distance of Raffles Place MRT. There are 28 pods mounted on the outside of the wheel so that your outward view is not obstructed by girder work. Each pod can hold up to 28 passengers but there was nowhere near that many in ours. There is seating but nobody sat down for long 鈥?there was plenty of room to walk around and being surrounded by glass the views were amazing. There was never a problem finding a place to view and take photographs, so most people spent their time doing exactly that.

Being a night flight, all the buildings, bridges, quays and roads were illuminated, making the views quite breathtaking. The Singapore skyline is a site to behold with all its iconic buildings and structures and the roads looked like huge luminescent snakes weaving through the city.

There was no need to book, and at S$33 per person (approx. 拢20) it was excellent value. There are other options, such as having a Singapore Sling for an additions S$36 (comparable with Raffles price) and a dining option at S$299 per couple. There were dedicated pods for the diners.

I consider the Flyer to be one of Singapores top attractions.",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"It was totally worth visiting it! Amazing views and nice experience in a clean, conditioned cabin. It feels totally safe inside even with smaller children, and you can take great photos there. Daytime or closer to evening is better since you can see more.",,,
,,Amazing views at sunset,4,,If you are visiting Singapore then the Flyer is a must see. The views of Singapore are amazing and you get to experience an all round view of what Singapore has to offer. The Flyer is a little pricey for Ticket as + $30 for adult ticket.,,,
,,Fantastic views!,4,,"This is worth visiting to get a 360 degree view over Singapore. The tickets are $33 and the ride last for approx. half an hour. I almost found it to move a bit too slow but it鈥檚 great when you鈥檙e at the top.
I recommend doing this at night time to see the city come alive with lights :).",,,
,,Very good views,4,,This attraction is recommended. It has good views of the city as well as the marina. We visited during the evening and the light are amazing.,,,
,,Views!,4,,"Decided to come here at night to get some views of the city lights. Were worried about big lines so aimed to get there for 7.30pm hoping everyone would be out eating.Timed it perfectly, we waited maybe 10 minutes!

There were only 8 people in our capsule which was nice. I felt very safe and only was a bit funny about the height once.

The views are amazing as expected, would recommend, it's one of those once in a lifetime things!",,,
,,Incredible views,5,,A must to do when visiting. Especially at night. Went last night and it's a wonderful experience with plenty of great photo opps from all angles.,,,
,,A Huge Experience,5,,"Arrived at 08:30 on a Friday morning and literally had the whole attraction (and cabin) to ourselves! Awesome view of the entire City and Environs. This is an outstanding engineering feat that takes your breath away. You won't regret taking ""The Flyer!""",,,
,,Awesome scenery,5,,Had the most awesome night with my partner. Beautiful scenery and we could not ask for more! The view of the Singapore Flyer at night is so beautiful that we were so amazed! This place is worth going and you should go there with your love ones for special memories!,,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"If you are looking for fantastic views of Singapore, do the Singapore Flyer! A great place to have a great view of the whole skyline of Singapore. We had a capsule of our own when doing the Champagne Flight - great experience!",,,
,,Offers a good view of the city,3,,Singapore flyer offers a great view of the city for a good 28 minutes. The cabins are spacious and comfortable. It offers a side view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which is not that great. However people with height phobia should avoid this. Personally I don't think its a must see in Singapore. Skip it if you are running short of time. It will cost you SGD33.00 per person for a 28 minutes ride. They do not accept AMEX cards.,,,
,,Nice view,3,,3/5 for me i rather go to MarinaBay Sands and pay the same amount to see the view (while having a consumable ticket for a coffee or snacks) than taking this singaproe flyer just saying 馃榾,,,
,,Overpriced,1,,"At $87 for 2 adults and a 3 year old, this attraction was not worth it. The views from the flyer are great, but there are plenty of places to see nice views in Singapore.",,,
,,Superb,5,,This is an tourist attraction..loved this place..you can click nice photos from this place..and Marina Bay in Sentosa which is definitely very famous and gives an awesome view when you see it from Singapore flyer..should really visit this place if been to Singapore..,,,
,,Singapore Sling Flight well worth it,4,,"We went on the flyer on our first night in Singapore, having booked the 'Singapore Sling Flight' which came with a Singapore Sling each and some light nibbles.

The beauty of choosing this option was we were given a private Moet & Chandon pod, meaning we weren't fighting for a good vantage point.

Such fantastic views of the city, gardens by the bay and Marina Bay Sands. Don't listen to those who say ""it's the same view as the skydeck at MBS"", because its certainly not, we went to both and this at night was a great experience.

Highly recommend the Sling flight!!",,,
,,Great Views,4,,Well worth the money to see the fantastic views. Ride lasts about 15mins which is long enough to take plenty of photos. No queues when we went on it in October.,,,
,,Great view of Singapore,5,,Certainly the only other way to get a good view of Singapore. The other being the Marina Bay Sands Observation Point which is higher than the top point of the Ferris Wheel. But it is very breathtaking. It is a must do attraction in Singapore.,,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"Really get to see the stunning Singapore skyline with plenty of time to enjoy the views. If it鈥檚 not too busy, they let you have a pod to yourselves. Each pod is spacious, you can even book a pod for lunch with waiting service. Not as big as the London Eye but the views are just as stunning.",,,
,,Who doesn鈥檛 love a big 鈥榦le Ferris wheel?,5,,"Large, enclosed, air conditioned cars. 30 mi. Total to get around. Go just before sunset and watch the city light up! Cheers",,,
,,Amazing views over city.,4,,"After a long queue to get on for general public, it was a nice experience that is shared with 15+ people. The views are amazing. We were lucky enough to do it the evening before Singapore's National Day so we saw trials over the bay, laser shows and even saw some of the light show of the super trees. If you want to be romantic with someone, I would suggest to look into unique experiences as well to make it more personal.",,,
,,Good view of city,3,,It is the tallest flyer in the world . Well maintained.. offers good view of the city.. Nicely lit up at nighttime.. Offers good view of marina bay sands as well ...,,,
,,Best night,5,,"Beautiful evening views. He makes an amazing impression. Spacious carriages, well glazed. You can freely take pictures. Of course you have to know who is getting in, because I once had a problem. Group 3 Chinese tried to paint the car and made countless photos. They were very loud. Fantastic attraction.",,,
,,Not average: basic,3,,"What is with metropolises thinking this is a good idea? ""The city as a playground"" maybe? ""Did it for the skyline"" perhaps?

It is so mediocre. London did it. Vienna did. Vegas did it. Tianjin did it. Even Niagra Canada did it.

It's the most cheap and basic accessory a city can add, and personally feels desperate.

That said, this is the 2nd biggest in the world. So if you are a ferris wheel kinda guy, hey!

Meh.",,,
,,Wow!!,5,,The view from the top was absolutely superb. It's worth viewing Singapore from the flyer. Even a person who is scared on a giant wheel can go as it's so slow that u won't feel any discomfort.,,,
,,Worth the ride,5,,"Expensive for the half hour rotation but we'll worth it! Unique perspective of the city with 360 掳 views. Really enjoyed it and wished it had been longer. Great photo ops. If you're scared of heights like me stay away from the glass, sit back & enjoy the amazing skyline. You will love it.",,,
,,Beautiful Singapore,5,,It's one of my favorite place in Singapore. You have to be here to see the changing of Singapore by night. I'll come back here next time.,,,
,,SG @ 360,5,,"It was quite not a good day at SG that time as it was raining on and off. Even with a small rain, the flyer are bound to stop accepting guests. However, soon as their team finds it suitable to do the flyer, they well do the same.

After about 10 minutes of waiting, they resume issuing of tickets and started to accept guests again.

Before going to the actual flyer, you will first go thru some bits and pieces of information relative to the inspiration on the said flyer.

Once you enter the actual flyer, you will be amazed as to how beautiful the view of Singapore as it starts moving up. Most specially if you are at the peak of the flyer wherein you will be feasting on the 360 degrees view of Singapore . It is such a great view that you will not let your self stop taking pics.

This is one highly recommended attraction in Singapore.",,,
,,Aerial View of a Country 馃槉,4,,The Singapore flyer is a giant Ferris wheel. That is continuously moving. A ride lasts 30 mins and is a slow ride designed to allow people to take in the views of the city and ocean. It鈥檚 a different perspective from the Skypark view at Marina Bay Sands. Do both of you wish but at least do one.,,,
,,Great views,5,,Definitely worth doing for the views... I highly recommend it. The cubes are very comfortable and if you do it in the night you can even see the city lit up beautifully.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,it was marvellous and Great chance to visit the Singapore city.enjoyed lot.Afternoon time is good according to me as there have good sunrise in whole area.Singapore weather is unpredictable .So choose sunny time if you need to get a best photo shoot,,,
,,Wonderful,5,,"We didn't book, and the queue was quite short, but it was a grey day! But we only had an overnight stay in Singapore so couldn't wait for the weather!! It was easy to access, and they only let eight people go in each carriage. It gave beautiful views of the city, including admiring were the F1 had taken place a couple of weeks earlier. Well worth a visit!",,,
,,Must Visit Place,5,,You will fall in love with the city after viewing it from the top of the flyer. The most appropriate time to enjoy the flyer is 6pm to 6:30pm. Where one can have the benefit of viewing the city in daylight and nightlight.,,,
,,A great experience,5,,"A great experience with fantastic views of the city and the F1 circuit, a long walk to Raffles from there we should have hailed a cab!",,,
,,Best way to see Singapore,4,,Singapore Flyer is the best way to see the skyline of Singapore. a must visit in the evening to watch the sunset,,,
,,Great views.,5,,This is a great way to have a overhead view of the city . Would reccommend a visit to this property but not during school holidays.,,,
,,Don't miss,5,,"Amazing view Money worth,.................,........... Half an hour tour Must visit Any weather Take a look at this pics",,,
,,Singapore eyed - In a Nutshell!,4,,For the people visiting the harbour - this is a must. Offers excellent views of the city and the excitement is palpable. One rotation is approximately 28 minutes as explained to me by my cabbie. The flyer also offers packages for more thrlls apart from just viewing. Couples may raise champagne glasses or the famous national cocktail of singapore - singapore sling. There is also provision for dine-in packages offering 2 rotations. All in all - a tourist activity not to be missed !,,,
,,My Singapore tour,5,,"During my recent tour to Singapore I had opportunity to ride this Singapore flyer.I had height phobia. I was reluctant to go on this ride first. But on insistent of my family members I had this ride.

The cabin is huge and can accommodate 10 to 15 people.This is very slow moving. All the cabins are air conditioned. Once inside , you will not feel it is moving. You will have a marvelous aerial view of Singapore city from top.",,,
,,Diwali visit,5,,"very nice experience, though a bit too costly. But scenery from top is great, you can see whole of Singapore",,,
,,Nice Marina Bay view,5,,"Not crowded, can visit on weekend too and chances of you occupying the whole cabin. Roughly 30 min ride. Have a mini exhibit on Singapore History before ride. Very nice view especially at night.",,,
,,Fantastic view of city,4,,It's a must visit during the city tour. It's the world's second highest flyer at 165 mts trailing by only 4 mtrs from the one in las Vegas.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"Reasonably priced with amazing views. There is heaps to see from the top, a must do while spending time in Singapore.",,,
,,High and mighty,5,,"Biggest in the world.Fabulous views ,great to orientate yourself in downtown city but it is quite expensive.Ride lasts about twenty minutes",,,
,,Amazing View,5,,"We did this as the sun was setting, our favorite was the night, with the amazing city lights, Gardens by the Bay, and the nightly light show in the Bay, gives it a whole new and beautiful perspective. Lots of room in the capsules, to walk around in and take photos from all angles and heights. This is a must do when visiting Singapore, well worth the price, like 32-SGD, and if you want they offer dinner rides at night, must pay a little more for this, but it would be a very romantic and interesting dinner, the views are breath taking.",,,
,,Nice flyer with view of city,5,,"This is tallest flyer with 28 cabins and moving slowly so you can see various parts of Singapore.
Big queue initially disturbed us but finally we got our cabin occupied by 18 people at a time.
Nice seating and viewing arrangements with safety of kids also.
Great fun filled experience at the end.
Must do this.
Note: purchase flyer and cruise tickets together (combo) can fetch 5 sgd discount.",,,
,,Amazing view,4,,The flyer is very slow moving so that it will not heartbreak.Very good view to full round take around 30mint.,,,
,,Great views,5,,This wheel is a bit pricy but the view is worth it. We went at night good views of the area all in all a good visit,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"A definite must when going to Singapore. You can see all the highlights of Singapore and you can walk around inside to see all the different angles, there is also seating. Unfortunately our experience was ruined due to a large group of families with young children who were running around and screaming for the full 30 minute rotation and we were bumped into and pushed constantly with no discipline from parents. There was food left everywhere and no respect for anyone else. We did ask if we could go up without the group in the line up but we鈥檙e told that it wasn鈥檛 possible. We logged a complaint with the attendant when we got off and we were told to talk to management but we could not find where they were located after asking several people. Even though this was a great experience and we would definitely recommend it the business needs to look into keeping groups together so it doesn鈥檛 spoil it for others",,,
,,fine dining in the flyer restaurant.,5,,"Excellent dinner, good food in a nice restaurant. After dinner we went for a tour in the flyer which gave us breathtaking views over the Gardens and the Marina bay, all beautiful lighted.",,,
,,Flyer,3,,"Have been on it before, many Years ago. It's one of those things that you do in Singapore. Great views on a clear day. But very limited in excitement",,,
,,Just awweeeesooome,5,,The view of the whole of Singapore it's just breathe taking..it's mesmerizing the 30 minutes ride feels like u want more u want to stay a little longer....,,,
,,Nor as scary as you think,5,,"Went on the flyer during the Grand Prix weekend, fabulous views from inside the capsule, didn't feel like I was moving so was at the top before I realized. Limited amount of people in each capsule so never overcrowded, would definitely recommend .",,,
,,nice,4,,"A must do when in Singers. Had the entire cabin to ourselves and views, as expected, are awesome. Value for money is average. well signed to get there, toilet amenities and some restaurants are nearby.",,,
,,London Eye of Asia,5,,"I was here in the afternoon, however, I personally feel that it would have been amazing by the night. Half an hour ride for the 360 degree view of the city!",,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,Nice and good traveler attraction. Must see.place. you get an overview of City on this. Missing this may cause to regret. Strongly recommend.,,,
,,A must to do,5,,"Did this at night and was amazing...if you time the flyer, at around at around time gardens by the bay does light show looks amazing from flyer..you just can't take enough photos to show how great the view is.",,,
,,A must in Singapore Visit,4,,Amazing bird鈥檚 eye view! Worth visiting! You can visit daytime or nighttime! We did both! equally good! Choose sunset time where you can get day and night view together in one round! Capsules are specious and not crowded at all so that you can enjoy viewing without any interruption! Moves very slowly so that you can enjoy viewing and taking pics! Definitely value for money!,,,
,,Average Place,3,,It was part of our city tour and though we were not interested in it still we had to spend one and half hour roaming around as we did not have the freedom to go ahead. Guide charged 52 SGD for this attraction even though counter was offering tickets for SGD 32. It was an open loot by the guide and unsuspecting tourists paid him.,,,
,,Very good view,4,,"It is half hour ride, the experience is great. You can see 75% of Singapore from the flyer. You can have great view of city. Flyer, Garden by Bay, Marina Bay etc. at night it鈥檚 wonderful view",,,
,,Night view is awesome,4,,We went to Singapore flyer on a weekday evening but due to Chinese festival break found a long queue. It took us 20-25 mins to get in the flyer but the night view was totally worth the waiting time. Recommended!,,,
,,Great Views!,4,,This is a little pricey but it does give you 30 minutes of 360 degree views of this lovely city. I do not think I would wait in a huge line of this but it is worth the views. It does give some information while on the ride. We only had 8 people in our cabin so we were able to move around easily.,,,
,,Modern Architectural Marvel,5,,The sheer size and technology that must have gone in to constructing this itself fazes you and when you complete one round which takes about 30 minuted you get a panoramic view of the city. It鈥檚 breathtaking.,,,
,,A must,5,,"All tourists have to ride this attraction when in Singapore. The price is reasonable. The view you get from all angles is absolutely amazing. We done it at dusk which was brilliant, to see the area lit up is eye popping. Highly recommend this attraction.",,,
,,Must visit spot in Singapore,4,,Must visit spot in singapore... 30 minutes ride and a good view of the city... early evening is the best time... online tickets are cheaper... 15 minutes from city and close to many other sightseeing.,,,
,,Views and fun,5,,The flyer moves so slowly you are unaware of movement. We went on a slow day/time and only 4 in our 'bubble'. Great views of the city and harbour area.,,,
,,Excellent,5,,This is a great way to see all of Singapore from above you get a really good view of the skyline it takes about 33 minutes to go around.,,,
,,WOW!,5,,"See Singapore on high, on a clear day you can see Malaysia.

Its amazing the birds eye view, the gardens, the ships, the quay, Merlion.

Well worth the cost, if Singapore is a stopover destination, make it 3 days, travel via Singapore airlines and you get free entry to The Flyer and so much more!

If you have difficulty walking, you get preferential treatment whilst waiting in line, you'll get pushed to the front.

Takes 30 minutes to do a full circuit and well worth the money, even if you only do it once in your life",,,
,,Gets a bit boring after a while,3,,Went on the flyer with my parents and it was an average visit. Although there were enough people in a capsule and not so much crowd we were jammed into a pretty full capsule. That put me off a bit. The whole round feels a bit slow and while the views from top are pretty amazing but that's unfortunately it. Feels a bit pricey for the experience. Visit if you have time. Not a must.,,,
,,Bird's eye view,4,,Not a must visit one. This can be skipped. I wasn't much excited after taking this ride. You can find F1 street circuit .,,,
,,Bird's eye view of Singapore,5,,"Definitely a must-visit while in Singapore. Gives a nice bird's eye view of the Singapore skyline. Would recommend visiting this place in the afternoon or evening when it's cooler and the city lights are on. The capsules are very spacious and can easily accommodate more than 10 people. For people with fear of heights, there's absolutely nothing to fear as the flyer travels very slowly - in fact so slowly that you would not even realize it's moving !!!!

One small fact for travellers on wheelchair - this place is not recommended as the flyer is continuously on the move and never stops- so it will be difficult to take ur wheelchair inside.",,,
,,Nice the 1st time. Boring the 2nd time,3,,In 2011 when i first visited it was a nice experience. However this time it was quite boring especially for my kid. Nothing new to see. Overpriced.,,,
,,"If you have visited Singapore, then Singapore flyer is a must,,,",4,,"It is a bit expensive but it is worth,,, Safe, secure and fun filled slow ride,,, Hope, it is the world's slowest fun filled, exciting ride to go on with. The spacious enclosure, spectacular aerial view and thrilling experience. Altogether,,, it is more than amazing,,,",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Largest Wheel outside the mainland USA. You get great views from the flyer through a full 360掳. Nicely airconditioned ""pods"" slowly rotate with effortless ease. Not crowded or noisy. One of a number of must does in Singapore.",,,
,,Good overall view of Singapore,4,,"The Singapore flyer is a good way to get a perspective of Singapore. It is a good experience and some good 360degree views.
I thought it was a little bit overpriced, however, I enjoyed the sights.
I would do this in preference to the Marina Bay Skypark.",,,
,,Beautiful views and Efficient,5,,"We lucked out when we visited, since there were not many visitors there. The views of the city, bay and Gardens were very nice.",,,
,,Great over all veiw of Singapore,5,,Takes 30min to complete. The queue can be busy depending the times you go. We went about 10am and the wait wasn't to long. Great view and experience.,,,
,,Ikon of the city,4,,"Great ride above the city, close to the Marina Bay, and right next to pitlane of the F1 track. Price is OK too.",,,
,,Excellent view of Singapore,5,,Flyer gives an excellent view of Singapore. There are 2 options to see Singapore city from top - Flyer and Skypark. I would recommend to visit Skypark to see Singapore at Night time and then go to the Flyer to see it at Daytime.,,,
,,Great views no crowds,5,,"I went on a Sunday early afternoon and the weather was fine, no crowds walked straight on the views are spectacular and would recommend to anyone.",,,
,,A great way to see the view,4,,A great view of Singapore at a slow relaxing pace do it at night for a better view. Thier are other things to do at the flyer as well.,,,
,,Highly recommended,5,,"Good experience for adults and children. The views of Singapore from the top is spectacular. The location is close to Marina Bay, Botanic Garden etc so easy to get there. Will definitely comeback when holiday in Singapore again.",,,
,,Worth it,5,,"It's bigger than the London eye. But very similar, in terms of the cube size and movement. There wasn't any line, so no waiting.",,,
,,Dinner by Dazzling Lights,5,,"For a romantic dinner for 2 hours and 2 full turns on the Singapore Flyer, my husband and I had a three course dinner in a gondola with three other couples. The menu was pre-selected including drinks - great experience.",,,
,,A must do when visiting Singapore for the first time,4,,A bit of a crowd when waiting to get aboard but the whole experience makes that worth while - views over Singapore (especially at dusk) are unequalled. Everything costs of course and some will shy away because of this but give it a go!,,,
,,Fantastic views,4,,This is a relaxing and wonderful way to view the city. You get great views across Marina Bay and also of the beautiful Gardens by the Bay. It takes just under half an hour to go round and it is a welcome break from the humidity of Singapore. It's easy to book tickets but they are a little expensive in my opinion.,,,
,,"High Flier, quite attractice from distance, best for sight seeing around Singapore",4,,"Though I was so excited, sheer slowness with not even moving speed de-climaxed the whole experience. At least binocular or special glasses could have given for an exciting view",,,
,,"Good Giant wheel! An over view of Singapore Downtown - NIGHT better than Day, Different than London Eye! (Ref our photos",3,,".. Make sure (read well & see photos) the SCENE before entering the FLYER, so that you can cover all .. !
.. Otherwise, You will end up FEW FRAMES in the camera
.. Beautiful (NOT awesome, compared many such WHEELS, at different parts of the world)
.. Similar views from Marina Bay Sands, to be honest
.. But the experience is different!! Over all OK!",,,
,,An over-rated experience,3,,We went to Singapore flyer with high expectations. Flyer tends to become boring after a few minutes as one finishes seeing the city and then the slow speed tends to be boring. It can be a good place to give some rest to your legs if you are tired.,,,
,,On a high note,5,,"It is a huge ferris wheel (the biggest as they claim - 165 mt, but I belive in 2014 Nevada opened its own biggest flyer). The cubicles are very nicely designed. They even offer dinner service there, we didnt partake it though.

While you wait for your turn you can see a gallery of information on the flyer which is worth reading.

The way the flyer moves is amazing and a lesson in engineering in itself. It moves so smoothly, it literally glides. I generally feel squeamish in Giant Wheels - but this one was too smooth for that.

Supposedly you can see all major tourist attractions of Singapore from it. They have even mentioned on the inside of the cubicle the name of the attraction, you can see from which side. However, I could not see all of the ones mentioned.

On exit, like in all other tourist places in Singapore, the exit is through a souvenir shop. This one has shawl holders-cum-pendants. I didnt see that anywhere else in any other souvenir shop as well as in China town. So if you like one, purchase it. I missed my chance!",,,
,,WOW! The view is amazing.,5,,Wasn't sure what to expect but the flyer was incredible. You have incredible panoramic views and you hardly notice you are moving. The cars are large enough to move around in without any rocking.,,,
,,Great views,5,,A truly relaxing way to overlook Singapore and the harbour. I'm not 4th he best at heights but this was so smooth it was fun. Not to missed,,,
,,Must do!,5,,Night time ride on this was a last minute decision that I'm very glad we made. The view of this beautiful city is incredible. The pods are air-conditioned and very comfortable. Recommended to all visitors!,,,
,,great views over Singapore,4,,Visited the flyer during the F1 weekend where our tickets gained us free admission to the flyer. The views are great to see Singapore from a new prospective. Great to see the F1 track from a different view.,,,
,,"Very good experience, 360 degrees view",4,,"Very good experience, 360 degrees view, one can walk around inside the flyer car and see the super tree groves, a close up view of the Marina bay sands hotel.",,,
,,Flying High over Singapore,5,,"We went at about 5pm and had a great time looking over the city, Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel , my wife took heaps of photos, Just DO IT!",,,
,,Great views,4,,We did this for the first time. You get some great views of Singapore. There was only 4 of us in the pod so it was great.,,,
,,Great view,4,,"Get a Great view of the City with Singapore flyver. It cost 33 SD for an adult. The Tour tankes 30 minutes with a Great 360 degrades view of the City. Each coach is with few People, so able to walk around. There are benchen if you just to sit an Enjoy the view. Before the ride you pass through an exebition.",,,
,,Great fiew,5,,Besting to see singapore at night. You also can have dinner and drink to enjoy the view with booking first.,,,
,,Champagne and great views,5,,Took a group of customers in a private capsule with champagne as a thank you. Great experience. Our trip started at about 6:30 so we had both a nice view of the city before the sun set and then the lights. Great experience.,,,
,,The Moet experience highly recommended,5,,"Taking the trip at sunset was lovely, I was able to see the trees light up and nice sunset over the water. The views are just incredible. The check in process was pretty efficient, there is a lounge on site if you want to have a drink. Fun to walk around the base of the wheel, which is like a rain forest with fish and frogs. The waterfront shopping area is also nice preview to the experience. Highly recommended!!",,,
,,Such a great experience,5,,Loved the 30mins ride. Really cool to watch the city during sunset. I would love a longer ride for sure.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Surely a wonderful experience, though you have to pay for the entrance fee but it not too much. It is completely safe, for those people who have fear of heights, you need not worry because I also do have fear of heights but did not felt that I was actually way above. The carriage was huge and can actually hold about 20people. It is airconditioned inside the carriage, there are seats inside of it. The view from above is amazing and really worth a visit.",,,
,,great pictures,5,,we have many good photos of Singapore taken from the top of the Flyer - breathtaking views! easy walk from the gardens,,,
,,"View Singapore from here, excellent, must visit",5,,"It is a must do in Singapore, If you are visiting Singapore Flier ,no need to visit Marina Bay Sands Skypark, better view from Singapore Flyer",,,
,,Great views to Singapore,4,,We are happy we went on the Singapore flyer although it is a little expensive. One of the many tourist attractions to do while in Singapore,,,
,,the View,5,,"Make sure it is not raining as your view will be spoiled, otherwise one attraction that is worthwhile. Queues can be long.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,Not to miss if in singapore its a must can see overview of singapore and amazing part is night lights superb view,,,
,,Great views,5,,"Visited here on second day of our three week stay. Worth every penny. Surprisingly quiet, my wife and I, and most other visitors we saw, had a capsule to ourselves.",,,
,,Top of the Singapore view,4,,"The giant wheel rotates slowly so you can have a complete view of Singapore marina bay,gardens by bay and also amazing thing for couple to propose or have a dinner date where you can exclusively enjoy food with your beloved.The whole trip is around 20 minutes and you can sit as well in the cabins.",,,
,,A superb city view,5,,Kindly request your travel agent to provide this attraction in the evening. Because you can see entire city glowing in lights & the view will be amazing compared to day light. It will be less crowded in the evening.,,,
,,Love it,5,,"we took ride late night at 10 pm as last passenger, Singapore looks stunning from Flyer, 30 minute ride was great experience.",,,
,,awesome views,5,,"the highest ferris wheel in Asia. pods move so slowly that from the ground it looks stationary . very good photo opportunity of the Marina Bay area. sponsored by Singapore Airlines each flight is just over half an hour. pods are large and will accommodate wheelchairs, seating is available for the duration but you can also stand and move around. about 拢20 equivalent in Singapore dollars worth it.",,,
,,terrific,5,,My husband and I took our 6 year old on the Flyer and we all loved the experience. Singapore is such a stunning island and it is even more breathtaking from above. Highly recommend this epxerience,,,
,,Bird eyes view of the city,5,,The wheel is well located and you get to see a great part of singapore from it. You can mix the visit with the hop on/hop off bus ride. which I think the brown line drop you right in front of the wheel. remember to purchase the ticket at ground floor before hitting the ride.,,,
,,Singapore Signature,4,,You can't go wrong with this one. The beauty of singapore will always hold to this one. such an amzazing touristry spot. its an open area so theres a lot of people. the smile of the singaporean and the diversity of this one will untold.,,,
,,Singapore flyer dinner,5,,"What a fabulous experience and a wonderful way to celebrate a special occasion. From the moment we arrived, the staff made us very special. Thank you for a wonderful evening.",,,
,,Quite well done,5,,Nice relaxing ride with great views and air conditioned cabins. $33 SGD per adult was less than we were expecting. Overall a good experience.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"If you want to see the best of Singapore this the way. Reasonably priced, beautifully maintained and run, you won't be disappointed, there are a range of speciality options as well. If you fly towards the end of the evening be prepared for queuing for flight and then taxis afterward. Overall though a great experience.",,,
,,Offers a different view of the city,3,,"When people visit me in Singapore I normally take them to CeLaVi or Spago to show a good view of the city that you can enjoy for free, and spend the money on a drink instead. But when my niece was visiting this year we went to the flyer as I figured she'd appreciate it. And despite having seem the Singapore skyline from practically all the tall buildings around, it was refreshing to see the city from the flyer's perspective, and well worth the visit.",,,
,,Worth one time view,4,,"As a person who craves for views from the above, I think its totally worth it. You can see the Singapore and many attractions in different angles. Much comfortable space.",,,
,,Trip on the Singapore Flyer,5,,Well worth the money and if you have flown with Singapore Airlines you get 10% off just tell them you flight number when you buy the ticket. Singapore has amazing architecture and gardens and you get a great view of it all,,,
,,A great experience,5,,"Second last day in Singapore, and the flyer is where we are headed this afternoon, on completing the Chinese and Japanese Gardens this morning. The flyer is as a great experience as the London Eye is, just in a different city of course, the views are breathtaking, and we ended up have a great afternoon with no storms. A must do if not just for the views. Fantastic location.",,,
,,Outstanding,5,,"This is a unique way of seeing the Singapore skyline, particularly at night (when we visited). The access is quick and efficient and the pods were impeccably clean and tidy. It was well worth the money and would definitely recommend it. They also have champagne and private dining options but we didn't try these.",,,
,,"It used to be packed, now it is not - Its a good thing!",4,,"I sat on Singapore Flyer three times so far. The first time was when Singapore Flyer just launched and it was so packed. Price ticket is standard SGD33.00 per adult.

Then the second times and third times, there were totally no one sharing the capsule with us - it was totally worth it to relax enjoying the 360 views of Singapore when you have a long day stroll adventuring around Singapore City.",,,
,,Evening vizit,5,,"Of course you have to go to the ring at evening,better to go at final session,if I not mistake the last round at 10p.m. View is more beautiful",,,
,,Flyer Ride,5,,Book tickets in advance. Better to take a ride in the late evening or night. It takes 30 minutes to complete one rotation. Nice city view from the flyer.,,,
,,For the great views of a beautiful city,5,,"I must accept that I have fascination for observation wheels - have done it in London, Vegas and now in Singapore. For those who may not be aware, this is the tallest observatory wheel in Asia and is indeed worth every penny.

This is located near the merlion park and offers amazing views of marina bay sands, Singapore sky line, merlion park, and also the channel leading upto port of Singapore.

The one thing that you should not miss while boarding the flyer is a camera as the 360 degree views that this wheel offers cant be captured from anywhere else (except of course the top of Marina Bay Sands).

If you visit during afternoon hours on a weekday then its not too busy and one can get the enjoy the views without necessarily worrying about the crowd.

If you are around and need some great views of this beautiful city, just hop on and you will capture the incredible beauty of Singapore. I am surely going back whenever I can",,,
,,Go just before sunset,5,,I've been there several times. It's a 30-minute ride in total. Go just before sunset so you get a view by the day as well as by the night.,,,
,,Amazing view,5,,"You get an amazing view of Singapore from the flyer, and I think it would be cool to take the flyer while the light show in Gardens by the bay were on (7.45 pm, 8.45 pm), but also while the sun sets. No matter what time of the day you decide to go, I'm sure you'll enjoy - at least I did :)",,,
,,121 Signal Squadron reunion,5,,Top place to get a birds eye view of Singapore Take a camera you will get some great photos Went in daytime but I imagine the lights at night would have been amazing too,,,
,,Amazing view from the top,4,,Your minds goes in circle .. amazing view of the marina bay.. a very good sight during night with whole place illumiated,,,
,,Very good,5,,By flying in Singapore flyer we have seen all around Singapore city in different views it was very good experience,,,
,,Great views,5,,Great views all round. Easy to get on and off. Air conditioned. Another stunning piece in Singapore to visit,,,
,,Definitely Worth Doing.,4,,"The Flyer is close to the Marina Bay Area. The capsules are comfortable and well air conditioned and the staff friendly.
The views are terrific. My only complaint is that there is no commentary to inform you of exactly what you are seeing.
A good value experience worth doing.",,,
,,Great views at sunset !,4,,Get some of the best views of the metropolis. Avoid the serpentine queue at the ticket counter by making an online ticket purchase. Find a slot just before sunset to see the city transform as it lights up,,,
,,Fly over the bay,5,,At first were in doubt whether try it or not but now I say do not miss it. Ticket is 28 SGD per person but worth it.,,,
,,"Super expensive, but great view",4,,"We got there faily early in the morning (9.30am) so there was no lineup. 2 tix for more than 60 S$... we thought, ok if we get a great shot and no linea, let's do this. Both was true, but for a less you can have a drink in MBS's spango bar and get a better view.",,,
,,Very scenic view,4,,The flyer is very scenic and you can see a lot of development happening in Singapore from this view. It's also very relaxing since you get to rest your legs after walking,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"What a way to celebrate a birthday!
A meal on tne Flyer was a great way to celebrate with friends. As we were a group of 6 we had the carriage to our selves.
The food was delicious (4courses)..
The only disappointment, it wasnt long enough!!!",,,
,,Wonderful 360 views,5,,Highly recommend this one. Night is absolutely the best. 360掳 views. Time it so you also get view of Light show at Gardens while on wheel.,,,
,,Well Worth the Visit,5,,For anyone with no fear of heights this is just one more attraction that makes Singapore so interesting to visit.,,,
,,Excited by the height,5,,This is a show stopper the views are amazing great to get your bearing while in Singapore. The only thing it does shake at the top and klunk a bit scare me to nearly death lol,,,
,,its good but not like supper duper hit,5,,We visit in Singapore flyer during our city tour. Its unique but its less then beyond our expectation.,,,
,,Superb view of the bay from high above!,5,,Try to go mid-afternoon. It was much less crowded and we had the entire capsule for ourselves. Exhilarating view of the bay from 165m above.,,,
,,A must when visiting Singapore,5,,We thoroughly enjoyed our 35 minute ride on the World's largest flyer. We choose to do this first to get a birds eye view of the city and get our bearings before jumping on the hop on hop off bus.,,,
,,Great views at slow speed,4,,Good value for money attraction that sees mostly everything in Singapore city & harbour. We would do it again next trip as very relaxing & smooth.,,,
,,Fab views,4,,"As you'd expect from this attraction you get to see fantastic views of the city- we went in the morning & it was quiet so we got the pod to ourselves which makes viewing so much easier as you're not all trying to get to see the same points of interest.

The Flyer seemed a little way out of the way but it is on the bus routes for the site seeing tours but you do walk through a rather strange area as you walk in- at first i thought we were going the wrong way but soon realised it was the entrance to the flyer.
Reasonable cost for the attraction SGD23 for an adult & it took roughly 30 mins for the ride itself; the staff were all very welcoming & i have to say its a very professional set-up.",,,
,,Amazing Experience,4,,Thoroughly enjoyable experience. Best time is to go around 6:30 to 7:00 so the sunset can be observed as well. A very smooth experience with beautiful views.,,,
,,Must do during the Grand Prix,5,,Entrance to the flyer was included with our Pit Grandstand tickets over the F1 weekend. This was a fantastic way in which to appreciate the track and obviously the many glorious views over the city. It was closed for a short time before we arrived due to the risk of lightening.,,,
,,Stunning night views.,5,,"After going to gardens in the bay ,,, make your way here, 10 minute walk. stunning views of Singapore not to be seen any other way xx",,,
,,Awesome view! Terrible food,4,,"Brought my visiting Thai friends here. Passion card holders get 5% discount off the tickets. We were there around 5.30 pm and i suggested eating at the Singapore street food located on level 1 since my visitors were hungry and wanted a taste of our local food. I am disappointed with the selection of stalls and many stalls were closed! Food served here was also rather disappointing. Expensive hawker food that wasn't good. As a Singaporean I am upset as this is a bad representation of our local food! My advise to all tourist, eat else where before coming and if you do have to eat here do note that the food served here is not what we normal Singaporeans would approve of.

The highlight of the evening the Singapore Flyer is another story. Awesome ride ! And good view of Singapore skyline. Sunset would be a good time to go on this ride. The skyline of buildings will be lighted and the view is really worth the ride. 40 mins to feast on our beautiful island of Singapore. Recommend that all tourists take a ride on the flyer when visiting.",,,
,,Nice view of singapore,4,,It is a 30 mins circle trip .. u get to see Singapore from a bird view. Nice pics can be taken.. better to go at sunset 馃寘 or at least during the day so u can appreciate everything u see,,,
,,Awesome view,5,,Very nice view.. a lot of restaurants to choose from plus a lot instagram-worthy pics for sure.. The place is nice for jogging and biking activities.. 馃槏,,,
,,Wow,4,,"What an amazing experience. Fantastic views and must for all who travel to Singapore. A note to travellers, if you have by Singapore Airlines you can obtain discount on quite a few of the attractions in Singapore. Just great.",,,
,,Do the Flyer,5,,Definitely worth shelling out the few Extra bucks it costs to do this while you're in Singapore. We'd recommend the 6.30pm time slot to take advantage of the falling sun for some nice photos then walking over to Satay by the Bay for dinner.,,,
,,"View MBS, CBD and City on the Whell",4,,"The fare is $33 for adult. The view is okay and remember to sit on the right hand side becoz the right hand view is better than left hand side, but only can enjoy the view when the compartment reach the peak.

The view is really awesome and the whole trip to finish the round is around 30 minutes.

My wife felt terrible becoz she is afraid of height but not me and I really love the sky.",,,
,,Great view over the city. Pod all to ourselves,5,,Great view over the city. We went to the Flyer with iventure card. We went early Sunday morning. We had a minimal wait time and we got to have a pod to ourselves. It's a fantastic view over a beautiful city. Would highly recommend it.,,,
,,Scenic view of Singapore,5,,Singapore Flyer experience summed up our visit to the Singapore. Travelling to Singapore would not have been completed without the ride to Singapore Flyer. You could view the whole lot of Singapore. Timing can be made near about the sunset time as you can experience the scenic view of Singapore at the day time as well at the night time. It's a must visit place if you are in Singapore.,,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Wonderful way to view the sights of downtown Singapore, and the cars are air conditioned for your comfort. Like everything in Singapore, the Flyer is beautifully designed, clean and efficient.",,,
,,amazing city views,5,,"happy to have visited this one.
if you have SQ boarding passes, you get 10% discount
tickets can be bought at ground floor and there are few other activities besides the flyer, but did not try them
we arrived at 10.30 and by the time we bought tickets, there were huge number of tourist buses which came making it very crowded, but good to get a pod for 2 families only (believe each one can take upto 16). it rotates constantly at a slow speed taking 20-30 min for a full circle and you get one circle. if the day is not cloudy, you get awesome views of the surrounding areas and i would prefer that to night time views",,,
,,Stunning views,3,,"This is a must do attraction in Singapore. Wonderful views on offer, so make sure it is a clear day when you visit, and a camera. It's a bit faster than was advertised on the website, about 30min from start to finish.

It is a bit pricy for what it is, and the visitors experience prior to boarding the Flyer was totally run down, and in dire need of refurbishment.",,,
,,Amazing views of Marina Bay,5,,We paid for the Singapore sling VIP ride as we were visiting family and wanted to do something special together. Capsules are clean and offer brilliant views from all sides. Seating inside if needed. Try to go as the sun is setting as its nice to see the city lighting up. Plenty of food options and retail area around the entrance to the flyer. Well worth a visit.,,,
,,Not worth the money and time,1,,"It was expensive and the view was not that spectacular. However, it will be amazing if you would be able to obtain tickets on Singapore National Day and view the parade if it is on the floating platform.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,4,,"Singapore flyer was a good place to be. Better to go in night as you can see beautiful views, skyscrapers, and breathtaking views. However it was very slow",,,
,,Something to do,3,,"Well, this will really blow your mind if you have not been on these kind of wheels before.
The most interesting aspect of this visit is the flight simulator in the building.
You will be trained by a real commercial pilot and you will fly a real simulator and at the end be given certificate for the training signed by the pilot. We even got a video of the training session!
However you need to book on time to get the maximum time you need.
It is very interesting.
We didn't know about that and so we where able to get only 30mins",,,
,,Best view of Singapore from Here,4,,"Fantastic view of singapore flyer from here. If you visit specially at Night, I can say that it will be a great experience to watch the lights of city itself.",,,
,,Singapore flyer.,5,,"Singapore flyer is one of the attractions of the sight seeing trips in the city. The buses will drop you there, you can have nice experience inside it and have an awesome view of the city. Entry tickets are there and it's worth to pay. It's a must visit location in singapore.",,,
,,Birds Eye View of SINGAPORE,5,,"In short, you will get a birds eye view of Singapore from this wheel. You can pay more to enjoy delicious meals on this course of having a glimpse of Singapore. Takes around 30 minutes for one go.",,,
,,Good,5,,Bit of a weird walk through some displays and ?art on the way in. Really good views- unfortunately a bit hazy when we went. Nice a slow. Can take lots of great photos,,,
,,Great way to see the city,5,,Great way to see the city. You can see a nice Singapore view from this wheel. The Flier ride takes about an hour and is really worth the effort.,,,
,,Fantastic to enjoy the lights of the city at night!,4,,Love being on this! It's a great way to see all the lights of the city at night. It's a beautiful sight.,,,
,,Great view over the city,5,,"Great view over the city. Free during the F1 weekend. We went their during sunset, so we saw it in daylight at nighttime. Must see.",,,
,,Great overall view of the city,5,,"A lovely way to see the city and get some perspective on where things are. Our ticket was included with our Formula 1 ticket, but would be worth doing at the normal price.",,,
,,Must Do!!!,5,,Amazing feat of engineering. All the facts and figures are display in the entry area which you can read if caught in the queue....I visited during a busy F1 weekend and the queuing wasn't anything to worry about. Outstanding views by day & night. If you can't do both choose an evening slot as the city skyline view is breathtaking. Ride takes about 30 minutes so you get plenty of time to take in the view plus those must have shots of that city skyline. Closes during thunder & lightning storms as you would expect.,,,
,,"Great views, worth visiting",4,,"This is like the other iconic flyers around the world, in London, and now even in Vegas. This one is in a prime spot on the water with great views of the City from every perspective.

Plan for an hour or more, go either at sunset or a little later when all the lights are on, especially in the Harbor area.

I loved that the pods are air conditioned also. Kind of a chill way to get a taste for this great City. Go early in your trip too.",,,
,,Impressive views over Marina Bay,4,,We were around many times but visited again during the Singapore GP. Free rides were available for ticket holders and not many people knew. So with only 6 people around in the cabin and plenty of time to see around,,,
,,Fabulous view is cityscape - worth the price!,5,,This is where you can get the most amazing view of Singapore (Marina Bay Sands Skypark also provides a fabulous city view). It is worth the price but be careful if you are uncomfortable with heights.,,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,Well set up and organised. Great views of Singapore. Bring your camera for taking scenic pics. Worth a visit!,,,
,,The Sights are amazing,5,,Loved the Singapore Flyer. The views were amazing allowing plenty of time to take photos. Looks awesome at night.,,,
,,Megga view F1 week worth a hour if spare,4,,"The view from the flyer was worth every penny well actually its free race week .
But think my tickets to F1 more than covered it ,
What can I say Que was short so family on the pod in no time they put very min amount people per pod so no filling them up . you can walk round get pictures view the sites at one point you fel the Marina Bay top deck is so close . the view is amazing I use that word too much but it is this is great experience wanted to go on again next day well it was free but Boss said no , I am child at heart should have had a paddy it works with kids . any way loved it got great pics and think even my son who never comments its good or great but comments on poor well more descriptive on not likes , loved it so thumbs up its a got to do thing .
if you want cheap but good food their are good places for food but street style vendors at base and its good very good and if its race week its megga cheap because the vendors in race track are not same price but theys street vendors are same price as norm",,,
,,Amazing views.,5,,Went on the Flyer twice once during the day & in the evening. Not sure of the price as it was included in our F1 tickets. Amazing views & the night time experience was beautiful & magical.,,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,"Something not to be missed as it has a breathtaking view. If you are skipping this, then don't miss Marina Bay",,,
,,A must do.,4,,"Plants are everywhere, including under the flyer to maximise the pleasant surrounds, despite being part of a small shopping centre. The view is amazing, especially as we had been in Singapore a few days and could recognise a few landmarks, not just the well-known ones. Definitely include this in your itinerary.",,,
,,Wings of flyer in Singapore,5,,"Hi
And as they say you fly high to see the world. And this was indeed one hell of flying experience.
You would love if you are a couple or a bunch of good taking people.

How to reach : get down at promenade metro and it's just walking.

Tickets : you get the tickets there at the ground floor - 33 SGD per person.

What to take : you can take some juices and packed food items along with you as the ride is a bit lengthy one. And yes don't forget your click'ocameras

It's basically a round ride inside a cylindrical shaped dome which takes you around and shows you the beauty of Singapore from above. You see the MBS, the sea,esplanade,the F1 circuit and lots and lots. The speed is such that you can enjoy each and every pal and capture each one of them in your cameras.

To summarise : it's one of the most beautiful, scenic and serene place/time/fly that we can ever have.
Thanksn:)",,,
,,London eye of the east,4,,"Having visited the London eye, I was expecting a similar experience and was not disappointed. Although the views from London eye are more interesting, Singapore Flyer still gives you a birds eye view of a lot of tourist attractions.",,,
,,2 Visits,5,,"We first visited the flyer on the day of the Formula 1 GP as it was free entry for ticket holders. It was a great experience and we returned later in the week in the evening to experience the flyer again in the dark.

The flyer offers fantastic views across the city and harbour and the photo opportunities are great, especially in the dark under the city lights.

Take around 30 minutes to complete a circuit. The price is around 拢18 per adult which is quite a lot, but it is an experience you really should do in this majestic city, and it is certainly provides breathtaking views.",,,
,,Giant Wheel - View Of Singapore,3,,"Being on the Giant wheel , you will get to see the whole of Singapore Recommend you to get on the wheel at night , Singapore looks more beautiful Thanks Varun & Sonam",,,
,,The best view,5,,"Amazing views but not if you don't like heights! We were able to watch dragon boats on the river, see the Gardens on the Bay from above and get a really good look at the Marina Bay Sands. As with everything in Singapore operation ran really smoothly. Don't bother with the posed photo though.",,,
,,Amazing View,5,,We really enjoyed this and were treated to amazing views of singapore. Takes around 30 minutes to rotate so plenty of time to take some great photos. We visited when the Formula 1 was on so took a bit of finding as roads were closed but normally would be pretty easy.,,,
,,Relaxing Ride with great views,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a great Ferris Wheel which will give you a very nice view at the skyline of Singapore.
There are several options how to use the Singapore Flyer.
You can either bord it at the normal cabin in form of a standard ride, or you can rent a whole cabin for yourself or even have dinner in one of the cabins with several rounds.
For most visitors the standard ride is sufficient in order to enjoy the view out of one of the cabins.
As the wheel is moving with a slow pace you will have enough time and possibilities to take pictures on the way up, on the highest spot and on the way down.
For anybody with agoraphobia dont worry the cabins are quite big so that everybody should have enough space. In the middle of the cabin there are seats so you can also enjoy the view sitting if nobody is in front of you trying to take a picture.
Visiting the Singapore Flyer is worth in many ways as you can enjoy a great view and as the Singapore Flyer itself is a pretty impressive construction!",,,
,,Great views,5,,Can't really comment on value as we had it as part of our F1 tickets but the view is amazing and well worth the effort.,,,
,,What a view!,5,,"The flyer offers some amazing views. We prebooked with a Singapore Sling which meant VIP entry and sharing with only one other couple in our capsule.

We were taken very good care of and ushered to our ride, bypassing those on the normal ride.

Some great views as we went up just as the sun was going down and everything was lighting up. Possibly going earlier (for full daylight) or later (when the lights were all on) may have been better, however still great.

Worth prebooking and paying a bit extra for the Sling.",,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,Brilliant view of the City and the F1 Track. We got discounted tickets because we had F1 Tickets. We chose the Singapore Sling and they give you this as a cocktail when you board the flight.,,,
,,Trip to Singapore & Bali,4,,"We visited the Flyer during the evening, it was very quiet and were able to get on very quickly. there were fantastic views over Singapore at night. We were also lucky enough to view the FI Circuit which was being built ready for the following week.",,,
,,Worth a Spend,4,,Worth a Spend.better go at night.can cover most of Singapore. have your camera ready. shopping is expensive inside the flyer mall,,,
,,Wow!,4,,Well worth going on! You will not be disappointed! The absolute best views of Singapore! A Singapore must!,,,
,,Nice view.,5,,You can see a nice Singapore view from this wheel. You need to book the tickets from any agent or hotels bcoz they give discounts to you.,,,
,,Awesome. Lovely views.,5,,The staff were amazing and very genuine. The flyer offers great views and you get a glass of bubbles too! We visited around the time of the Grand Prix and it's the best view of this city at this time of year. Quick eats are available in the nearby area and no trouble for seniors or kids. Highly recommended.,,,
,,You gotta do it!,5,,Fantastic view of the city and a once in a lifetime experience! I enjoyed the view of the Barrage where it is hard to believe that below there is a tunnel of traffic and an MRT line!,,,
,,Very good experience,5,,"We enjoyed whole Singapore at one point under our foot ;
Singapore flyer is just like a round wheel it takes you from your ground level to the level at which you can't get enough words to explain how will be your experience
Add Singapore flyer in your Singapore tour
Amazing Singapore tour",,,
,,Awesome views,5,,Ticket for TheFlyer was complimentary with our grandstand tickets for the F1 GP. No long queue and not at all busy,,,
,,2017 F1 Night Race and sight seeing,5,,Wow what great views now the second highest in the world after Vagas built one 2m higher. Walking distance to Suntec City and to Gardens of the Bay,,,
,,Fantastic Experience - Free with F1 Ticket,5,,We went on the Flyer after the practice sessions on the Friday of this years F1 event. The admission was included within the track tickets which we did not realise until we looked on the Singapore F1 App on our mobiles. The views are outstanding and I would very much recommend going at night to see all the lights!,,,
,,Do this at night. Spectacular views & lighting.,5,,I chose to do this at night & the line up was not to bad. The views are fantastic with all the different lights & it goes quiet slow so plenty of time to enjoy.,,,
,,Formula 1 Flyer Experience,5,,"We attended the F1 last week and got free entry to the Flyer, so rates highly for value for us. Normally $35 I think so not excessive if you're paying.
The first thing that appealed was each pod is air conditioned. Coming from New Zealand's winter/spring Singapore is hot and humid so AC was great.
Clean and tidy, good staff and fantastic views. Really enjoyed it.
We spent 1 hr there but if you wanted to have lunch or a snack could have been 2 hrs.",,,
,,Long way to the top!,5,,"Calm, peaceful, slow and steady. Take a ride to see an amazing view of Singapore city centre and the surrounding area. 360 degree view of an amazing place. Did it during the day due to time constraints but would have loved to have done it as the lights to the city were coming on. Spectacular view by day and I think it would be even more spectacular by night.",,,
,,Awesome views.,5,,We did the flyer as it was free with our F1 tickets. Amazing views of Singapore and the thing was not too busy considering everything going on. I don't know if normally it is busy.,,,
,,A must do tourist spot,5,,"I visited the flyer the day after the F1 race, I expected to wait ages and be squashed in with loads of people but in actuality it was deserted, I waited all of a couple of minutes and was in a pod with just 4 others.
Unfortunately the most horrendous downpour started just as I got on so I got very few good pictures and the view wasn't spectacular, however, it would have been had the weather played ball!",,,
,,Not worth the time,3,,There are so many tall buildings and bars in Singapore that the view from the flyer is nothing new. It would have been fantastic in a flat city (London eye) but in a tall city not worth spending the time.,,,
,,best way to see whole singapore in just one ride,5,,coolest way to explore whole of singapore in one ride u can have a best experience of singapore ac ride surely recommend this place to everyone,,,
,,bird's eye view of Singapore attractions,5,,"Decided to avoid the crowd and did the flyer late morning - Could have had the cabin to ourselves, but choose to share with a New Zealand couple. Views were fabulous!
The flyer , unlike other wheels is slightly slower so photo opts are easy to take.
Loved the entire ride.",,,
,,Nice Overall view of Singapore,4,,The view is nice but I think regular price is very expensive to pay for it. Had a huge discount when i went. Overall good experience but once is enough.,,,
,,Must do visit,5,,Great experience. Very well organized worth spending the time in the flyer great views. Better to go a sunny day,,,
,,Loved it!,5,,"Excellent experience - I guess this sums up everything! I loved the way they have provided capsules to ensure safety. At a time, each capsule can accommodate 28 people. The speed of the flyer is so slow that it allows you to view almost the entire city !",,,
,,Good views,4,,"Not sure what more I can say than the title. It's big, and you can see a really long way over all the city. It's very clean.",,,
,,Well worth it,5,,Access included in our F1 tickets but had it not been I would have been more than happy to pay for. Wonderful views of the city and race track,,,
,,Great views,5,,Been 3 times over the week here at different times of the day. If you like sky lines the evening is a definite time to go,,,
,,Amazing View,5,,Had an amazing experience at the flyer. It is slightly over priced but it do offers some great and breathtaking views of Singapore and the bay. The capsule is spacious enough and we were 10 adults in 1 capsule. My kid enjoyed a lot and we got some amazing pictures.,,,
,,Breathtaking scenic view of Singapore,5,,"I rode on the flyer and the experience was amazing. once you are on the flyer, you are able to see virtually the whole of Singapore. the splendor and beauty of the city can be captured with its romantic waterfront and bustling city life. initially before you get on the flyer, you are scared, but the safety features and the near zero speed makes you feel related and comfortable. it was an experience behold and tests one's fear of height to the limit.",,,
,,Showing around SG,5,,It's a great place to bring your friends if they visit SG; you can see a lot from the flyer and it's quite slow; you get to enjoy the view It's not crowded at all during week days in the morning. After the SG flyer we went to the top of Marina Bay Sands and had lunch (very windy place),,,
,,A good welcome treat to Singapore,4,,"I have tried other panoramic ferris wheels before, and this one in Singapore is one of the best. It gives you a nice view of the city, particularly of the Marina Bay area (including the posh Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the Gardens by the Bay behind it, Merlion Park, and Raffles Place). One complete rotation takes about 30mins.

The ride takes you some 165 meters high. Before getting into one of its capsules (I don't know how many persons it can comfortably accommodate, but certainly less than 20 since it is smaller than the capsules of the London Eye), you'll first be given some background on its story by passing through the multimedia sala called ""Journey of Dreams."" After the ride, you can enjoy shopping in the many retail shops or have dinner in the restaurants in the area. They also have an XD theater and a reflexology and fish spa center.

The ride is on daily from 8:30 AM to 10:00 PM. Ticket for adults is S$33 (roughly US$25). Kids and senior citizens get a special discount. TIP: check the weather condition first before going to Singapore Flyer, because they cancel the ride when weather is not good.",,,
,,Views are wonderful however expensive,4,,"The flyer rotates very slow so you don't even feel you are moving or on many feet above the ground. The city views are great however this is an expensive tour, around 33 SGD per person for 30 min ride.",,,
,,Amazing view !!!!!,5,,I was there last years we bought ticket for person is 30$ Singapore not bad Because u can see nice view great experience I was there I really love,,,
,,A Visual Retreat,4,,"The beautiful skyline of Singapore is spectacular from the view up there.

You just have to soak in to the atmosphere, take lots of pretty shots and have relaxing and memorable time.

We went in the evening and as such we managed to get a glimpse of evening and night view. It was a visual retreat!",,,
,,Stunning !!!,5,,"Was lucky enough to go on this on the Grand Prix weekend
Stunning views over the city and the bay
So good to see the F1 track lit up and laid out below you.
The views from this are stunning. The whole city laid out below you
And to watch a thunder storm come in from the bay and engulf you
The whole experience is well organised and the cabins air conditioned
A must see",,,
,,wonderful experience,5,,"we went on it as part of the F1 programme. Each capsule can accommodate 28 persons, but inside it is spacious, air conditioned and comfortable. People just take turn to sit down and take pictures. We got a wonderful of the marina bay. The whole experience is about 30 minutes. I am glad that we went on it.",,,
,,Great attraction and View,5,,We enjoyed another trip to Singapore and this time we did the Singapore Flyer. Went there in the afternoon and had a great weather to view a lot of things including the setting up of the F1 race.,,,
,,View Singapore from a height,5,,"The Flier ride takes about an hour and is really worth the effort.
My husband wasn't keen since he is not fussy on heights but had found this quite ok. The view is apparently just as good at night. It is very well organised and you are ushered through a shop on the way out. Your photo is taken in the way in and by the time you come out a variety of shots have been prepared for you to buy. It's s very slick marketing organisation.",,,
,,Best view of sunset against the city skyline,4,,"We brought the kids to experience this on the eve of a Public Holiday at about 630pm or so. We went up while it was still bright and at the peak, the sun was starting to set which made the whole experience great.
At this hour, the queue for purchasing the tickets can get quite long so it may be good to be early!",,,
,,A bit expensive,5,,a bit pricey but deserves it. to be seen just before sunset or daylight. at night the Skyline is beautiful but you don't see much of the city. if you travel with Singapore Airlines remember that you are entitled to a small discount.,,,
,,Enjoy the views of Singapore,5,,"Singapore flyer is probably the second largest flyer of the world. It has 28 capsules.each capsule can accommodate a good number of people but the best is when u May get an opportunity to be with less people in the capsule. You may like to click pictures from all angles. The marina bay sands, the fascinating flyovers, and water on one side with the buildings on other present a charming,photogenic view. The fee is 33 dollars per person. I got a chance to go in the afternoon but most people prefer the time about the dusk so that they can have a look at the day Singapore as well as the glittering night Singapore.",,,
,,Beautiful but fishy experience,3,,"The transition between ticket sales to being seated on the Flyer would be what you would expect of all things Singapore - highly efficient. Everything is shiny and new and the views of the skyline were simply breathtaking. But what we did not anticipate to also... um... take our breath away was the effect of deodorants losing their battles to the sopping humidity - or did fellow travellers not having any anyway?
To top it off, said travellers decided to take out their sneaked in tiffen trays to eat their pungent rice and pickled fish mix while enjoying the view. Much to say the majority of the 30 minute ride was a mix of placating our irritable kidlets, refraining from reverse parking our lunches and having our faces looking as green as this Garden City. Hmmm...",,,
,,Great views,4,,Great views of the city and harbour. We had no wait time and our group of 4 had a pod to ourselves. Takes 30 mins to go around.,,,
,,Always a great view,5,,The flyer never fails to impress. It is worth doing day and night to get the full experience and see the magic of marina bay and gardens by the bay at night,,,
,,Singapore Sensation,5,,WOW! We took the Singapore Sling flight and it was amazing. We joined another couple in the Moet & Chandon Capsule for a 30 minute joy flight with amazing views over Singapore. The Singapore Slings were quite strong but very enjoyable as was the snacks provided.,,,
,,Not worth it if you are visiting MBS skypark,4,,Singapore Flyer is close to Marina Bay Sands hotel. People can avoid the flyer altogether if they are planning to visit Marina Bay Sands Skydeck. MBS skydeck at $24 is cheaper then flyer @ $33 and provides excellent views from a better height.,,,
,,Kids enjoyed it,4,,Singapore flyer is fun to go if you have nothing else to do in singapore :) my 6 year old wanted to go so we went:) it's a good view from up above and if you just wana chill it's a 30 mnt ride but it's abt 30-35 SGD per person,,,
,,Wonderful view,5,,"We enjoyed our trip on the Singapore Flyer. We skipped the 'entertainment' before the ride and simply joined the queue. Our wait time was approximately 15 minutes.

The views were wonderful and we enjoyed the pace of the rotation. There was only one rotation; however, that was all that was needed. It was a great way to see Singapore from above.",,,
,,Great attraction,5,,Another great attraction. Can see all over. Nice 30min ride. We had the VIP pkg with champagne and snacks with no waiting line. Beautiful and colorful at night.,,,
,,Fantastic Views of Singapore,5,,"The Flyer offers fantastic views over the Gardens By the Bay, Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Shoppes and the Singapore river. You can also have dinner on board for a romantic night out. two revolutions of the wheel which takes about 30 minutes for each revolution.",,,
,,Incredible views,5,,"Worth to see the views of the skyline. Best tome is during sunset times, the clouds and the setting sun give a dramatic image. Definetly recommend. The glass is high quality, no issues in taking pictures.",,,
,,Great Night Out,5,,We have been on the Flyer before but this time we went in the evening and enjoyed a meal on the Flyer. The meal service is offered as an hour experience (two complete revolutions of the wheel) whilst enjoying a three course meal. We booked this experience from Australia and were supplied with all the information required including menu choices. Whilst enjoying the trip we could view all the lights in Singapore including the light in the Gardens. A great experience,,,
,,Was a great experience,5,,"My family and I have enjoyed the experience in the capsule up high in the sky. The panoramic view was amazing. We were there at sunset, which means it was phenomenal.",,,
,,"Nice place, nice environment",4,,Very well organised like everything in Singapore. Perfect view from the top. We expected more people (like in London) but there are not that many over there.,,,
,,Nice!,4,,"The best to be on the Flyer is at night to see the beautiful lights within the city and especially Formula 1 track. You can enjoy entire city from flyer including Gardens by the Bay, SkyFall, Merlion, Museum. But it's very slow so be prepared to get bored by the time it ends.. :)",,,
,,Recommended,4,,"A wonderful ride. The whole ride took about 30 minutes to complete a cycle so there was plenty of time to take in the view, identify the buildings and take photos. Our small family had the whole car to ourselves, which made it a more private and relaxing affair.

The car is considerably large and stable, which is great for bringing small kids. You get to see Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, the ArtScience Museum, The Float stadium, and other buildings in the city. We went a week before the F1 race so we had the opportunity to watch the preparation of the race track.

Be sure to relieve yourself before embarking as it takes quite a while to complete the cycle.

It's SD 33 for adults and SD 21 for children aged 3-12.",,,
,,Good view of the city,4,,"it is a good vantage point to see the city. Queue may be quite long. the flyer moves very slow - good for people who want to take their time to enjoy the view, but something to consider for people who are rushing.",,,
,,AMAZING VIEW OF SINGAPORE,5,,"I was at the Singapore Flyer last Wednesday. I booked two champagne tickets and took the 7pm ride. We will welcomed at a VIP lounge and took an internal lift up to where the capsules are. Attendances are all so friendly and courteous. The capsule we entered was so nicely presented with super chilled champagne and lovely chocolates. It's so amazingly cozy inside. Of course, we were not alone as we were boarded with another two couples from Australia. The capsule is still super big and comfortable. The scenery was already amazing while I boarded but it was breathtaking when it gets darker and when the lights of the city were up. It was awesome viewing Singapore up there and not forgetting that this is the F1 season therefore I was able to view the circuit right from the top. I engrossed myself into the beautiful sky, marvelous landscape, the sea and all those outstanding buildings. It was so relaxing up there and before I could start dreaming it has comes to an end. Overall this is a unforgettable ride.",,,
,,Well worth the cost,5,,Like the London eye and worth the cost to see across the Singapore skyline. Very rainy as we started but cleared when we got to the top opening up the views.,,,
,,Great views,4,,"Definitely worth a visit as you get great views all over Singapore city. The Flyer is just across the bridge from the Marina Bay Sands hotel and shopping centre complex, and right beside the pit lane for the Grand Prix circuit. Definitely worth a visit but maybe either do this or the viewing deck at Marina Bay Sands as similar views (although viewing deck is open air)",,,
,,Great experience,4,,"This was much better than I anticipated, we went up just after sunset and it was beautiful, thoroughly enjoyed and recommend.",,,
,,Fantastic ride!,5,,"Took this attraction as part of the iVenture pass and it was totally worth it. The ride lasts for about half n hour and you get fantastic views of the city. It was empty when we went so we had the entire cabin to ourselves. If you do the flyer, then i wouldn't recommend using any of the other viewing attractions as this one gives you great views in itself.",,,
,,Amazing views,4,,Fantastic time on the Singapore Flyer. Great views. Lovely clean pods. Went in the afternoon when it wasn't too busy which meant no waiting in lines.,,,
,,singapore flyer is similiar to London eye,4,,Singapore flyer is a experience by itself and seeing singapore in a nutshell is a different feeling altogether.,,,
,,Worth a ride,4,,"If you have been to other flyers in other leading cities across the world, you would really appreciate this one as well! It is SG tour for you in a nutshell!",,,
,,Cool.,5,,"The views are amazing. Each car can fit about 20 pax. 33 SGD/pax, different price for senior adult ( above 60 ) and kids below 12. If you took mrt, go to Promenade Station. Upon exit, walk further (towards the flyer - look up ahead) using the pedestrian walk (around 5 mins walk). After the ride, you can buy the merchandise at 3rd floor (arrival floor). Eateries are available on 1st floor.",,,
,,A Good View of Singapore,5,,"This is a great way to see the areas surrounding the Flyer. When we visited they were setting up for the F1 race and you get a good look at the track. Like most places of interest in Singapore, the Flyer is well set-up to handle lots of tourists smoothly. You get the obligitory photo taken as you enter and get to choose from 3 different poses when you exit through the gift shop. There are restaurants on the lower levels of the facility if you need to eat when you visit.",,,
,,Recommend Visit by Tourists - Nice view of Singapore,5,,"Review by Dr Sim. Recommend visit by Tourists. Quite Pricey Tickets. Nice view from the top. Similar concept to the London Eye. Tourists will be more appreciative than Locals. Like when I was tourist in London and went up the London Eye, I was more impressed than the Locals. Regards DrSim001",,,
,,Awesome place to see singapore from sky,4,,"One of the best ride in singapore. We loved the place. Just beside marina bay and if u ride the flayer, u must enjoy it. You can see the best view from here",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"Singapore Flyer is a must. Reasonably priced, and we were lucky enough to have a pod to ourselves. The pods can take 28 people, so are large enough to move around easily. The experience only takes 30 minutes. It is very slow moving so no need to feel anxious !",,,
,,Good views,4,,"We went on flyer while in Singapore for 4 days, the views of the city are amazing and you get to see the starting grid and all the way down to the first corner of the Grand Prix Circuit. Priced at 32$ may be a bit pricey, hence not been much of a queue, but worth the views.",,,
,,Awesome views,5,,"Really cool experience, we went around dusk time. It was easy to get to and quick queueing. We had own our cabin as it wasn't so busy. Great views.",,,
,,full of pictures,5,,wow and wow and wow friendly staffs really made our visit here. such a wonderful view and well really enjoyed ourselves,,,
,,You get what you see!,4,,"We recently visited Singapore and took a flip on the ""Flyer"". Nice and a must do at least once. A few tips:-

- it's a bit of a walk to the nearest MRT so if you have another way to get there try that

- really tricky trying to work out where you get a ticket (ask a local)

- it's slow. Be patient, relax and enjoy it. The views are great",,,
,,"Must do, very comfortable",5,,"This is one of the must do attractions, magnificent views including the best view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel & Casino buildings and Skypark",,,
,,360 skyview,5,,"One of the must things to do in Singapore, it's not doubt about go into the Singapore Flyer! During day or night the view and the experience will be unforgettable!",,,
,,Great view of Singapore Marina Bay area,5,,"I've done this a number of times! For me, around 7:15 to 7:30 pm is best as sunlight disappears and the city lights com on - all while making the trip around the Flyers circular arc.",,,
,,"Point of view of a ""local tourist""",3,,"I've been slowly exploring various places of interest within Singapore ever since I gave birth together with my infant boy so my whole purpose of bringing him to the Flyer was for him to experience new sceneries and see new things which is usually very exciting for little children compared to us adults. The cost was reasonable I feel, even for a local. There are discounts available with the Passion Card, Krisflyer and your Singapore boarding pass (for tourists). Children under 2 get in free anyway but only downside is you cant bring your stroller along because it is inaccessible to strollers for safety reasons. But this also got me thinking - like what about people on wheelchairs? Didn't really ask but this could be an issue for those moving around on wheelchairs.
Experience in the capsule was pleasant. We were lucky to get a capsule all to ourselves because we visited on a quiet off-peak weekday afternoon. Good all round 360 view of the city skyline and bay area. You also get to see abit of a birds eye view of Gardens by the Bay which was nice since I haven't been there either.
Would definitely recommend for tourists and also locals who haven't already been here.",,,
,,Must do. Prefered during twilight time,5,,The best place to see a panoramic view of singapore. Its not at all expensive. The location is just next to the F1 track.,,,
,,Best Attraction in Singapore,5,,"Excellent value, the Flyer was magnificent. Will definitely come back and do the Dinner Circuit. For the best views over Singapore in every direction, this is a must for a visitors. I'm not keen on heights but this is fine.",,,
,,All ticket booths were closed..must buy on line,1,,"I was very disappointed, walked there from our hotel in the heat and humidity, to find no ticket booths open. Asked for help and the attendants sent us to another closed ticket booth...we could see that the flyer had people on it but many of the shuttles were empty..not happy at all",,,
,,excellent ariel view of the city,5,,"just the the flyer expierence to have some breathtaking view of the city.though it looks like a giant wheel it moves very slow and steady,you will be closed in a cabin, well secured.very close to the mrt.Overall takes 1 hour. little over priced,but worth it.33sgd each.",,,
,,Great view - a must see!,5,,"The flyer should be a must see while in Singapore. The flyer provides excellent views of the city and travels at a leisurely pace to provide a sufficient time to look. The cars are air conditioned, clean and spacious. They are way to get in and out of for all ages. There are benches in the center of each for people to sit. Definitely recommend this sight!",,,
,,A Marina Bay must.,5,,"Sure Ferris Wheels have been around for years. But when you go on the Flyer you can see why. The thirty minute rotation gives you a unique and impressive overview of the Marina Bay Area, gardens, ocean and city. The capsules are spacious and the bookings are not timed so you can just turn up at any time of the day that suits and line up for the ride. I reckon this was on of the bets value for money activities at Marina Bay.",,,
,,For Muslim don't expect Halal food,3,,Please come with full stomach coz no Halal outlet or restaurant only 7-11 with Halal snack only subway non Halal Good thing there is sholat area for praying,,,
,,Bee jay,5,,"Absolutely amazing being able to overlook Singapore at great heights, great value... u can get a discount if u fly Singapore airlines just have proof of your flight",,,
,,It's a one stop photo place,4,,"Flyer is a great place to see most of the Singapore. One can see the skyline of Singapore from a good height. Ideal for taking photos.
Best time to visit is around the blue hour in the evening. One can see the lights in garden's by the Bay as well as lights on the marina bay sands.",,,
,,Good scenery,5,,We got a good 360 degree view of singapore at the peak of the flyer. It was amazing as we can see the skyline of singapore. The cabin was huge. Would recommend to go on non peak period as we get a lot of space in the cabin to roam freely and got a nice photo.,,,
,,Best views of the Singapore business district,4,,"I visited the Singapore Flyer while in Singapore. Its a great place to view some contemporary art installations and light displays. More importantly, while on the Flyer, you get the best views of Singapore financial district. You know that popular Hong Kong Skyline picture? You get almost similar views from the flyer. Really good shots.",,,
,,Magnificient view of Singapore City,4,,To be honors....The flyers ride was a bite over price. Get an evening ride between 6.30~7.30 would be the best view on top of the flyer.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"Take a ride on the iconic Singapore Flyer to have an overview of Singapore's buildings and landscape. It's an amazing and nice experience to take a ride on the Singapore Flyer either in the day or in the night, Remember to go for a ride on a fair day so that you can have the best view.",,,
,,Bird eye view on Singapore,4,,I do recommend for once in a lifetime experience for tourist to see the bird's eye view of singapore land marks. Highly recommended.,,,
,,First time visitors to singapore,4,,"As first timers to Singapore we thought the flyer would be a great way to view the city

The flyer travels very slowly so for those scared of heights like me it is very calm and amazing views

Lots of space as you are not crammed in at all so perfect 360 views",,,
,,Should do if you are visiting for the first time,4,,"Many of my friends recommended i skip this place but since my family was visiting Singapore for the first time during this trip i decided to do this even though i had visited earlier.
It is a nice experience for first timers. We had only 2 other people in the car. The staff are really nice to allow max privacy to patrons when there is less rush which was the case during our visit.
You get a very nice view of the port area, the large financial and hotel buildings, Marina Bay Sands and the two Domes from the top of the ride.
there is also a very nice information display before you enter the ride.
The food court at the base offers a nice selection of items to eat and refresh.
Do it to get a good starting feel to Singapore.",,,
,,Must see,4,,"This is not that spectacular but definitely worth trying it. From the capsule you will have a great view to Singapore and it is a good chance to take great photos. It is 33 dollars and takes around half an hour. Do avoid crowded capsules because as the wheel turns you need to change position to catch what you want. I think you better wait for the next capsule if you are above 12 already, especially if you want to sit. Please note that the wheel never stops, so the capsule is very slowly moving while you entering. Don't panic, but be focused and control children. Enjoy!",,,
,,Very enjoyable half hour,5,,"Maybe a little expensive but we really enjoyed the views and orientating ourselves to the city. Try to do on a clear day of course. The engineering information available on the walk up to the capsules is really interesting. It's probably something you would only do once although I would have liked to have done again at dusk as the night lights would be really pretty. The Helix bridge, Art Science Museum, The Float (floating sports field), Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay are all reasonably close, could walk to them. Overall a great experience.",,,
,,Oh my god,5,,This one is bigger than the London eye. Give you a 360 degree view of Singapore. I would recommend you to take this ride in the evening around 7:45 - 8 PM so that you can expirence the wonderfully lit Singapore and gardens by the bay show which starts at 7:45 pm.,,,
,,Lovely City View,5,,We love this ride. This takes about 30 minutes to one round. Experience is fabulous. You must take a ride on this.,,,
,,A fun family experience,4,,"We took about 10 family members on the flyer, and the capsule experience was interesting. I'm afraid of heights so was glad there were interior benches to sit. The kids loved every minute. You really were able to see so much of Singapore it was a great visual experience, especially for tourists.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,We visited Singapore flyer with the best moment in india never fill this type of adventure we very enjoyed there,,,
,,What a view,4,,A great way to see the city from.on high. It is a tourist trap but dont let this stop you from going the view is worth the visit.,,,
,,A MUST DO,5,,"Seven of us went we did not have to share the pod with others.
Started just before it was dark a great time to go, it goes very slowly in fact you felt you were'nt moving at all would do it again
You can dine onboard it takes you round twice, it is over $200.00 plus 10% surcharge and 7% vat",,,
,,Interesting sights.,5,,Worth a visit to see everything going on in this area. We chose a hot day so was quite tiring walking but we kept going as there was so much to see. Tourist area.,,,
,,Great views!!,4,,"After a bit of a slow start at he ticket office, Not due to it being a busy day. Anyway, We got on the Flyer, it was a great experience with Fantastic views, this takes about 30 minutes to do a Full circle.",,,
,,One time visit,4,,I went there in night time and took the flyer ride. This is ok place. Good for one time visit but not wow.,,,
,,Could have been better,4,,Amazing views at night time of the harbour. Not as good as the London eye but nevertheless a nice experience,,,
,,Panoramic views,5,,Enjoy the panoramic views of city from 165 feet observation wheel.The wheel will be moving very slowly allowing you unobstructed views.Take a ride at dusk .it is more beautiful when lights come up .The 30 minute ride in air conditioned glass capsule is enjoyable.,,,
,,Fun activity for all ages,4,,The flyer gives fantastic views of the city and the half an hour flys by as you are drawn into the beautiful surroundings. A must see when in Singapore!,,,
,,Great view of the city,5,,"It's a great way to see the city from above. I would recommend going there in the evening. The city is lit and very pretty. If you time it around the light show at the marina, you can see it from above. It takes around 20-25 minutes to buy te tickets and queue to get in the cabin. If you want to see the light show from above, then make sure you are at the flyer 40-45 before the light show starts. The whole loop of the flyer takes 30 min.
Both adults and kids annoyed it very much.",,,
,,Its was okay,3,,Wasn't anything amazing but was okay. I got bored after a while as there was nothing much to look at.,,,
,,Just Awesome,5,,I have been on a Ferris Wheel before but this one is probably the best.We took the premium ride which included Champagne and chocolates in the 30 minute ride.Spectactular views.,,,
,,"Fun, but probably better at night...",4,,"Had some time to kill on a recent business trip to Singapore, so I walked down to the Marina and went on the Singapore Flyer. It was a Saturday, so it was pretty busy all around.

Boarding the cabin should be a fairly easy task, but there was a large group of people from either India or Bangladesh, possibly Malaysia, that couldn't follow instructions. The ferris wheel doesn't stop, so you have to keep moving to board the cabin. The workers were telling them to board, board, please move forward and get on, but they all wanted to be in the same cabin, and were messing up the boarding process for everyone else.
The cabins hold around 20 people I think. Anyway, they eventually figured out that they had to just get on and their party would be split. The ride takes about 30 minutes. Views were nice, but it was cloudy and rainy the day I went, so it wasn't the best. I can imagine that it would be beautiful on a clear night.

It was fun to do it once. If I go back, I may do it again at night, but wouldn't do it again in the daytime.",,,
,,Fabulous views,5,,"My husband and I decided not to do the flyer as we had seen the city from the Marine Bay Sands roof, I'm so pleased we changed our minds. They limited the number of people in each pod so only 6 of us were in, which in my mind is better as you can move around the pod without worrying you are in other peoples view. It was also a clear day so you could see for miles, all across the city and beyond. An amazing experience.",,,
,,An enjoyable surprise,3,,"We ended up with a sort of spare day in Singapore and had enjoyed using the excellent SIA Stopover perks including the bus as it came virtually to our door. We seemed to spend this last day on the bus as wife had clothes to collect along Orchard Rd and some shopping and we did the Botanic Gardens first. Lots of on an off in heat.
We were ambivalent about the ride but the bus stopped there, we had free entry so up we went. Despite the small print on the travel card from SIA about having a boarding pass as identification, no one had even bothered about it at any other venue but an officious person here said she would. Of course I did not have it but with some mind dredging remembered the flight number. She was unimpressed.
It was good! Nicely cool, shared the cabin with three others and just sat and admired the view and took breath.
Don't usually do revolving venues but was enjoyable.",,,
,,Stunning Views and Helpful Staff,4,,"My Mother and I used the Singapore Flyer on a recent visit. She is wheelchair bound and although it took a little longer to get settled, the staff were very helpful and showed us how to board safely in with her wheelchair. The gondoliers are clean with informative posters and great views, seating and space are also provided, The views of Singapore are amazing and I found the whole experience spell binding - not to be missed!",,,
,,A must vist attraction,5,,"The Flyer is a great place to visit, you can see most of the city. It is a great feat of engineering and moves so nicely you hardly know that it is moving. If you are a photographer, it is a must visit",,,
,,Great views,3,,The view is really good. As the tallest Ferris wheel it has a novelty factor if you like that kind of thing. The trip takes about 30 mins. We were there on a Saturday afternoon and there was surprisingly few restaurants etc open around the site. There also wasn't much signage leaving the site trying to walk back to our hotel at Marina Sands - choose your route when you're in the sky!,,,
,,Best view in Singapore,4,,"My husband and I had this on our list of things to do in Singapore and I'm so glad we ended up doing it! It is a bit pricey, but worth it for the views and the experience. We had about 10 people in our car including ourselves. Our luck just happened to stick us with a really large, loud family, which was a bit of a distraction from the experience. I'd say, it's worth it to try it once at least!",,,
,,singapore flyer,5,,I am afraid of heights but i braved it becasue it was included in a package deal. And i'm so glad i did. its very smooth so you can't feel the movement. Amazing views and a great way to make friends,,,
,,good experience,5,,The experience was good and whole singapore city view is good. the speed of flyer is also very good.,,,
,,Once is more than enough,3,,"I had the dilemma to doing either this or marina bay observatory deck and reading up different websites led to more confusion. Finally doing both of them and finished the flyer today. A pretty average experience and 33 dollars per adult is way too high for this. While i know, this is one of those places in singapore thats highly regarded but still this can be given a miss.",,,
,,Breath taking views,5,,"We visited the Singapore Flyer around 4pm in evening. This was a nice experience for us, when the flyer reached top we could see far away Islands as well. This capsule is well protected and with air conditioning inside.
The trip would be around 30 mins for the full circle.

There was an option of dining there.",,,
,,Excellent way to view the city,5,,"My family and I really enjoyed the ride. There weren't any queues, and if you show your Singapore Airlines boarding passes, you get 10% off. Really worth doing!",,,
,,good experience,4,,it allow you to see all Singapore but it is expansive. it is good experience if you are welling to pay.,,,
,,"Great view, walk through lobby was disappointing",4,,"I recently had a friend visit Singapore and thought it would be a great experience for him to see Singapore from above!

The first thing you鈥檙e greeted with at the flyer is the 鈥榳alk through鈥?lobby. This was very sad. A lot of the installations were not operational and it felt like a cheap and nasty amusement park.

The actual flyer itself was amazing. Great views of Singapore!",,,
,,Complete view,3,,It is the eye concept that started getting replicated all across the world. The best part is that it is in top of formula 1 track. Provides beautiful view of Singapore. An amazing view of buildings which defines skyline.,,,
,,"Views are good, but like many others",3,,"The location is fabulous, giving the best city views. But there are many other places like bars etc where we could get similar views while grabbing a drink n catching up with friends for almost the same price!",,,
,,Good view,3,,It is a flyer like the ones in London or in Bangkok. I think it is better idea to go at night becauese the neighborhood gets prettier at night.,,,
,,The second best view in the city,4,,"A 30 minute rotation on the wheel gives you ample time to take photos and orient yourself to other sites in the city. Air conditioned, safe, clean. Watch out for the lines!!!!",,,
,,Great 360 view over Singapore!,5,,"You have a great view over Singapore, the bay and the start and finish of the F1 track. You can just sit and relax. But please: trun down that music. It can become really annoying.",,,
,,A must see,5,,"Reminds me of London eye. Safe , sophisticated & picturesque. Could be great for families.I LOVED THE VIEW AROUND . Specially the view of the harbour.",,,
,,Wonderful view,5,,"The ride (one full rotation of the wheel) takes about half an hour. Just sit back and enjoy the marvellous view. The cabins are air conditioned and spacious and on the day we were there, the staff were spreading the customers over several cabins, rather than over-filling individual ones.

I would love to go back and do the trip again in the evening - it must be an amazing view of the Singapore lights!

There are food outlets and toilets in the building surrounding the Flyer.",,,
,,Awesome Ferris Wheel!,4,,"It takes 30 minutes per revolution. Each compartment can hold 20 people no problem. You can reserve the whole compartment for a private gathering if you book, that costs extra and revolves twice. There are spectacular 360 degrees views . Whether you go during daytime or night time it has its own appeal and romance. Fun for everyone.",,,
,,Good view... but a little boring,4,,The ride takes about 45min-1hour Little if u are a teenager with a familu Good place for a perfect vacation photos Infrastructures are absoluteli beautiful,,,
,,Ride the great wheel,5,,"A ride in this wheel will be an adventure rewarded with great views of Singapore 's famous waterfront dotted with skyscrapers, beautiful buildings and older terraced housed right in the city centre .",,,
,,Absolutely fine for Vertigo sufferers!,5,,"I was a little apprehensive about this attraction but the kids wanted to go so I thought I'd give it a go. Most of the Tripadvisor reviews stated that it wasn't good if you're scared of heights, as I am to a certain extent. However, this wasn't a problem at all. It doesn't go whizzing round and, in fact, you can't actually tell it's moving unless you look at the pod above you. The panoramic views are amazing and you can see for miles on a good day. Fairly expensive 85 SGD for 2 adults and 1 child ticket, but when in Rome....!
Also, there's a fabulous ice-cream place at the exit which you must try when you've finished the ride.",,,
,,We enjoyed a nighttime ride and enjoyed the lights in the city,4,,Our only complaint was that we were ready to disembark sooner than the ride ended. It's a great view of the surroundings. Don't miss it.,,,
,,Pretty lights,4,,"Singapore flyer is good and travelling at night meant I got to see the bay lit up. Only downside was that I did not know what I was looking at, an app/ guidebook would be useful",,,
,,It's a best place to go in evening,5,,It's a must go place in evening. The atmosphere around is very nice my wife loved this garden very much. We had great relaxing time here. Crowd was nice and place is nicely maintained.,,,
,,Unique Experience!,5,,"This is also a must visit attraction in Singapore.

You can experience breathtaking, panoramic views of the city. It鈥檚 also Asia鈥檚 largest observation wheel.

The flyer operates from 8am till 10 pm daily.

However remember to check the weather before you purchase tickets as they do not operate when there is thunder & lightning as a safety precaution.

Highly recommended for families with children!",,,
,,Must do!,5,,"If you have ever been on the London Eye, this is very similar in size. Really big. Room to move around and explore the different sights as you move up and around. Beautiful views of Singpore. We went at night, and it looked awesome with all the lighting and the streets lit up.",,,
,,Must try for first timers in Singapore,3,,A bird's eye view of Singapore. A bit boring as it is running very slow. The cabins are spacious enough but not so good when you're with noisy people around.,,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"Really well organised from start to finish. We got a 'pod' to ourselves which was great. Luckily it wasn't too busy when we went. Great views across the whole city, very enjoyable. This would be great in the evening",,,
,,Great view..,4,,Its a bit costly giant wheel that moves pretty slowly. May be visitors should get on this and will get an idea of what is where around the Fullerton area..,,,
,,Cant believe how big this is!!,5,,"This is the worlds biggest observation wheel, and the size of it is hard to put into context. When at the top you are higher than many of the Sky Scrapers, its quite some experience.
The wheel is so sturdy that there is no wobble.
The views of the Marina from here are a must see.",,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Great views to be had, the cabins are very spacious and room for everyone to love around and take in the view, birds eye view of Singapore, it does cost $33 per adult, but money well worth spent, it is so peaceful",,,
,,Spectacular view,5,,We enormously enjoyed the view from the Flyer. I would go there again this time in evening to see the city lights.,,,
,,Nice view,5,,Must go when in Singapore . We really enjoyed the view and experience . You will never know that its moving when its going though the circle .,,,
,,Relaxing view,4,,You can get here with a short walk and with the MRT train. It offers a great view of Singapore from the bay to the city. You can also dine in specialized cabins. The ride moves very slowly taking 30minutes to complete.,,,
,,Wow what a view,5,,This is a must do......... if you want to see Singapore I highly recommend this one. You will love it. Great value for money and you may see something you would like to see from there as I did.,,,
,,"Over Hyped,Expensive.",2,,"33 SGD is way too high for this ""OK"" ride. The flyer is definitely hyped. I would prefer the Marina Bay Sands Skydeck.",,,
,,Amazing views across singapore,5,,If you are not worried about heights then I suggest you visit this attraction to get a full view of Singapore with amazing views,,,
,,Wonderful experience,5,,"A Birds eye view of Singapore, though the views were same from our hotel/ Marina Bay sands & the Flyer, the charm in experiencing the different view points & the wonderful pictures that we could click was no match. We went on the Independence day (Aug 9), just went for the ride spent an hour or so in the park beneath , clicked hell lot of pictures and then we were exhausted. It is very well maintained with a variety of food outlets to match everyone's taste. Restrooms are well maintained. A must visit on your bucket list while visiting Singapore.",,,
,,An excellent view of the City of Singapore from one place,5,,"Singapore flyer is an iconic must experience place when you visit the city.
Unique thing is that it does not stop and one boards or off boards while the wheel is in motion.
It takes good 30 minutes to complete the circle and when moving up/down one gets to see the the Marina Bay, the riverfront, Gardens by the bay and number of iconic buildings of the city.",,,
,,Panoramic City View,4,,"The flyer is huge (bigger than the London Eye) and the capsules allow plenty of space to walk around and take photos. As you would expect, there are fantastic views of the city and harbour and you see things from a very different perspective. Recommended!",,,
,,fantastic night view of Singapore.,5,,It is the perfect place to watch the fantastic night view of Singapore. A place to experience while traveling in Singapore.,,,
,,Very nice at night,4,,"We did this in the evening so it was dark by the time we were like halfway around, very nice. The pods had plenty of room in them & visibility was good.",,,
,,Must See when in Singapore,5,,"The Singapore Flyer offers fantastic vistas of Singapore, uniquely beautiful at night but incredible nonetheless even in the day.

The ticketing staff is efficient and friendly. The location is at walking distance from other attraction around Marina Bay, the Shoppes, Gardens, Helix Bridge, ArtScience Museum and the Merlion Park.

One must ride the flyer to get a sense of Singapore's new Marina and the larger city that for a tourist is otherwise impossible to achieve within a few days.

Unlike other attractions that have run of the mill stuff, the visitors' shop has good collection. So if yore on a short trip take advantage of their collection of souvenirs. Is usually avoid these shops a they cater to captive audience. However wanted to share my own atypical experience.

Don't miss the Flyer. Strongly recommended.",,,
,,Nice views of Singapore,5,,"The Singapore flyer offers beautiful views of Singapore. It goes very slow and takes 30 mins to complete the journey. At the top, one can see Malaysia as well as Indonesia. It caters for persons of all ages.",,,
,,Great experience,5,,The location is just 15 minutes walk to merlion park. The cost is S$33 each. The time for the whole ride is 30 minutes. For me it's a great experience it's worth the money. You will see the whole city and the movement as you don't feel anything coz it's very very slow. You can capture best selfie in the air. It's a one of a kind experience.,,,
,,A grand ferris wheel amisdt of the city,3,,The flyer is worth a visit because thats the new icon of Singapore like the Merlion for many. But frankly speaking it is a little heavily priced than its worth. We spent almost 30 SGD for a single person. But yes the views are good but similar or better views can be found from MBS top deck.,,,
,,Loved the ride,5,,"It was wonderful 30 minutes in Singapore Flyer, we were thinking it was similar to Delhi Eye (India) from a distance. But finally made up mind to go for it and it was lot different from the other. So i recommend everyone not to miss it. Go in the evening (at 7PM) for a beautiful view of Great Singapore.",,,
,,Largest wheel,4,,The views are fantastic day or night. Easy access by public transport or tourist bus network. Check out reflexology of the feet also here. It's great.,,,
,,Nice view,4,,This is similar to the London Eye. It is a slow-moving capsule with good views of the city. I was glad a family that I happen to join for the ride brought some food to share. That is a good tip!,,,
,,Fantastic view of Singapore,5,,One of the most amazing things to do in Singapore. You can have a look at the entire Singapore through this. It's a 45 min giant wheel ride . With spectacular views. Must do in Singapore,,,
,,Enjoyment reduced by other tourists!,4,,"This was the third time that we had ridden the Singapore Flyer. On the first two occasions, we had been fortunate in sharing a passenger pod with small numbers of people who displayed good manners and some consideration for others sharing the pod.
Unfortunately during our most recent ride on the ""Flyer"", we had to share a pod with a family group who displayed no consideration for either another other family group or my wife and myself, who were riding in the same pod. Members of this family group spent the entire 30 minutes of the single rotation speaking loudly and running from one side of the pod to the other, to take photos. They did not care whether they blocked anyone's view by standing directly in front of them nor were they concerned that their loud conversations may have been an annoyance to others. The small children from this family group were allowed to run amok and yell and scream for most of the ride.
It was actually quite a relief when our pod reached the boarding area and we were able to get out!
This is not intended as a criticism of the people who operate the ""Flyer"", simply it is a comment on what we experienced during this particular ride. It is intended as a criticism of people who do not know how to properly conduct themselves in a public place.
The staff at the ""Flyer"" are obviously well trained and supervise the boarding and exiting from the pods in a well organised and responsible manner.
We are fortunate that we have had the opportunity on two previous occasions to enjoy the great views from the ""Flyer"" unencumbered by poor and selfish behaviour.",,,
,,Great Views,4,,The flyer was a bit pricey but went for 30-40 minutes and goes very slow so if you are a bit anxious dont be as you hardly know your moving. Stunning views,,,
,,Spectacular Experience,5,,We experienced this key landmark in recently concluded Singapore vacation as a part of day-time city tour. Fortunately for us the weather was clear & views from the coach were amazing. Can't really comment & compare whether it is better to do flyer during day-time or after sunset.,,,
,,Nice view,3,,"If you like gud views from a height then this one's os for u.. u get to see a nice view of entire Singapore in the 45 min journey of the flyer.the flyer is not fast,it moves slowly.only few seats will be available for sitting so if u don't get a seat u have to sit for the entire journey, if u get seat u can't click the view photos..so it's up to you to choose",,,
,,The Best Wheel,4,,"On our recent visit to Singapore I wanted to go on the Singapore Flyer but my husband didn't as he doesn't like any of the wheels, because he doesn't like heights. I love going on them and because he knows this he goes on with me after a bit of persuading. This is about the fifth or sixth wheel we've been on. He actually almost enjoyed it. I personally preferred this to all the others because it went quite slowly, the cabin we were in felt really safe. When we were up at the top, I felt as thought I was just sitting in my lounge, the only thing missing being a cup of tea, ha ha. Each pod holds quite a few people, There were only eight in ours, it didn't even feel half full. Best of all the views over Singapore were incredible. The ride was very smooth. I think we were on for about half an hour . When we got off my husband said it was the best he had been on both for the ride and the views and hadn't felt anywhere near nervous as he usually does. Well worth the visit",,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Great experience, watching the fantastic surrounding, elevating slowly to the top and decending. It was a very smooth ride, with Airconditioned inside. Took 48 min to complete the ride. At level 1, there is a prayer room too.",,,
,,Singapore at a glance,4,,I haven't been to london flyer so cannot compare but this one is definitely worth riding. The ride time is around 30 mins and gives you an excellent view of the entire city. One of the ride box also has the option to sit and dine which you need to pre-book. This ride doesn't operate during heavy rains so plan accordingly. The best time to take this ride is in the evening around 5.30-6 PM when you can see the sunset and also view the lit up city,,,
,,Worth a visit,5,,We visited this after a morning at the Gardens by the Bay. We purchased tickets via a third party website before we went so got a better price. The attraction itself was very quiet and we even managed to get a capsule to ourselves. Great views across Singapore - especially the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The air conditioned capsules and the distinct lack of crowds made it a welcome relief for half an hour. Would definitely recommend.,,,
,,Bird eye view of Singapore,5,,"Apart from Marina Bay, this place also gives you bird eye view of the city. It is 40-45 minutes ride and you will have the relaxing time here. Singapore has started to host Grand Prix and it will be amazing to catch a glimpse from the flyer in September. It has air-conditioned capsule hence weather has nil effect and can be visited both during the day and night. It moves very slowly hence people who have phobia with speed/rides do not have to worry",,,
,,Singapore Flyer is an All-in-One package,5,,"This is the best place to see around Singapore. In the night, this place is very beautiful. You can see the Singapore port and all the famous places from up here.",,,
,,Stunning with the view.,5,,"Ur thing so nice and safe, ur staff did very good job to help and support to the guest. We got the good experience from you, thx so much.",,,
,,On the top of the world,5,,What a amazing feeling we were getting at the top of the world on Singapore flyer it's a really well planned ride slowly slowly giving you the view of complete Singapore,,,
,,Nice,5,,Huge. You will be able to see alot from the flyer. Worth paying. Nice scenic view. Go in the day. You will see more,,,
,,Amazing Experience,5,,"This was a beautiful experience, a truly great opportunity to see all that Singapore has to offer. There were only 7 other people in the capsual with me, so it was very spacious.",,,
,,Breathtaking views,5,,"We went on the flyer in July 2017, we were surprised to find it very uncrowned, so much so, that we had one of the absolutely ginormous pods to ourselves!! It's quite slow, so you have plenty of time ( and space) to look around and see spectacular Singapore from the top of the world! Very clean , as is absolutely everything in Singapore, and well worth the money. One hint, don't go when you see bad weather coming, as we got to the very top of the ride, it stopped for a few minutes ( which was no hardship at all) we could see a huge storm coming, as it turned out, they were unloading people as soon as they got on, because they stop the ride completely when bad weather is coming as a safety precaution, we were lucky as we managed the full rotation before it was closed for a couple hours. I think it would be spectacular at night, so consider going after dark also. Very well run, polite and helpful staff, and much bigger than the London Eye, which we did in May 2017. Great fun and spectacular photo op!",,,
,,"Good Fun, With Marina Bay City Views",4,,"The Flyer is a great attraction, which gives terrific views of the Marina Bay area and the gardens & tall trees over the water. It鈥檚 a calm, relaxing experience which even those usually afraid of such 鈥渞ides鈥?would appreciate",,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,You are able to see great landmarks of Singapore. Best view to Gardens By The Bay. Breathtaking. I would recommend it most definitely.,,,
,,Awesome Experience,5,,Must Visit place if you are in Singapore. Awesome view of city. Experience was awesome. it takes about 45mins to complete the ride. They also provide Dinner on specific decks which is at different price.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,A real great way to see Singapore from the air. We went in the late afternoon and got some great sunset pictures. Very close to the central area so very accessible. Recommend it to anyone with some free time,,,
,,One time spin!,5,,"This was a spontaneous decision to visit the flyer and I made it just in time on my last night in the city!

The ticket costs about SGD 35 per person and theb you head up to the lounge area which is basically a walk though before you get on to the ride.

As you reach the ride, you are ushered into a cabinet with another 8 passengers and then begins the ride.

The ride takes approximately 30 minutes and is best done at night for the city's spectacular views! By far the best 360 view of the city, as a tourist, I'd check this off my list for sure.",,,
,,Very good,4,,One of the top 5 experiences to have in Singapore. Provides an excellent view of the city. Each capsule can accommodate 20+ people.,,,
,,It was okay,2,,"I wasn't too impressed with the Singapore flyer, it's around $30 dollars and the staff will allow you on even if a place to sit isn't available.
The views you get are incredible and you have plenty of time to capture the moments.
I do believe it takes a little too long to go around but that could be due to safety measures and the amount of space it covers.
All in all it is a good experience but just a little timely.

What I would recommend is to go during the night as everything is lit.",,,
,,Great Experience!,5,,It was our good luck that we were the only couple.It was a perfect romantic experience. The view of Singapore is too good. Must go for all,,,
,,Spectacular views,5,,"Tickets are purchased on a different level to the entrance, and signs are non existent or well hidden - discount for seniors although only for those resident in Singapore. Locating the ticket office is the most problematic. Once on the flyer, well worth the experience",,,
,,Great views!,5,,"If you have 30 minutes or so to spare, check this out! The pods are spacious and they only put a few people in each. The views were great!",,,
,,terrified,5,,"my family forced me on this as i am terrified of heights and this flyer is higher than london.
It is like a white knuckle ride to myself , but my family assured me it was fabulous and the view were spectacular.

The capsule itself moved slowly and there was plenty of room.
It was very safe",,,
,,Once again - well organised and family had a great experience,5,,We booked a private flight with a Singapore Sling ( non alcoholic for the teens ) and had a fantastic time. Views are amazing and hospitality is on point.,,,
,,Breath taking views,5,,We went on a nice day and had most of he vessel to ourselves. You can get amazing views from up there and it rotates at a really good pace...,,,
,,Dizzying Heights,5,,The Singapore Flyer gives a sensational birds eye view of this beautiful city. Whether you are a tourist or a local you can't help but be mesmerised by the cityscape stretching as far away as the horizon in all directions.,,,
,,Great view of Singapore - Very Long Queue to get in,3,,"This ride offers you the best views of Singapore once you reach to the top. View is better in the evening/night. The queue to very long to reach to the flyer cars, it is really tiring if you are accompanied with small kinds and infants.",,,
,,Beautiful view over the Singapore skyline,4,,We took the trip just when the sun went down and could experience the city turning into the dark. A must when in Singapore.,,,
,,Spectacular Views over Marina Bay,3,,With 20 people in one pod made it was a little difficult to see the view and there was a lot of standing. Queues to get inside took more than 45 minutes. Best to go outside school holidays.,,,
,,Great Way to Observe Singapore City,5,,Views are amazing how ever the entrance is bit misleading. Only small board's avaiable for directions. A must visit if you visiting Singapore.,,,
,,Great view,4,,"You can have some great views of the city. It moves slow so You have ample time to take photos and all. It was not that crowded when we visited but it still took us 30 minutes in line & a long walk to get back.

Go at Sunset time for better views otherwise if you want to see lit skyline than around 8pm.",,,
,,Nice experience,5,,This was the first time we visited such a flyer. It gave a nice bird view of the entire city. Best to visit in evening when the city starts litting up !,,,
,,Lovely,5,,"Everyone might think it's just a ride in a big wheel, yes it's a wheel ride but with an amazing view, you can see almost every place of the city . I personally recommend to take a zoom camera to take with you when you go as you can take lovely photos of the city .",,,
,,Wonderful & exciting journey on Asia's biggest flyer,5,,The flyer is just awesome and a never miss in Singapore. Very well managed and run you can easily buy the tickets and board your flight. Crowds do come here but you can plan your trip well thru online booking. It has some great restaurants & gift shops. Flyer is one that you always go to in Singapore!!,,,
,,Holiday,4,,Went to the Singapore flyer to experience the ride and see the views of Singapore from a different perspective and got some great photos from the attraction. There is so much to see if Singapore from here and when visiting Singapore on holidays would highly recommend to try this so long as you are not afraid of heights.,,,
,,pretty alright - good experience,4,,"Pretty alright experience. Went their in the afternoon when it wasnt crowded and easily got the tickets and the flight.

There werent many people in our capsule so it made for a good viewing of the singapore.
May be the attraction is more crowded in the evening and night times so as to view the skyline at night.

However, it was good enough views.
It is top attraction of singapore and some thing to tick out in that to do list.",,,
,,360 view of the Skyline,5,,"Best time to go - evening! You get to enjoy 360 view of the city! The ride will take about 30mins and for celebrating special events, you can have the capsule to yourself for dining in the sky experience.",,,
,,view from the top,4,,"similar to the london eye the singapore flyer gives you a view from the top of singapore and of course a top to bottom view of the MARINA BAY SANDS . all around view of the sea /ocean . avoid a rainy day

evening view of the colours of the gardens by the bay is great",,,
,,"Was Great, Just lots of people",4,,The Singapore flyer gives tourists a great opportunity to see the city from a 360 perspective. The length of the wheel was perfect and well worth the money although it was disappointing that we had to share the box with other people it made it very uncomfortable.,,,
,,Good View.. Worth visiting first time,4,,"How could a wheel which moves at such slow speed be any interesting.. thats what i thought as well.. but boy i was wrong. The view from up the box with family or a special loved one.. is something different and an awesome experience
Pro- tip -> if you are are with gf or a fun group.. try to get an empty box.. which is only possible on non weekends/ holidays.",,,
,,Go on a clear day,4,,"Based in an otherwise boring part of town the views from The Flyer are worth the 33 dollar entry fee.

Although it's not as high as some of the downtown sky scrapers the view extends over a large part of the Marina Bay Area , the waterfront and the central business district .

For those interested in F1 there's a good view of the main grandstand and pits area .",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"What a great experience. Seated in comfort, travelling in a circle with the best views over Singapore. Absolutely loved this experience.",,,
,,Not worth the money,2,,It is no wonder why the Flyer got into financial trouble. You travel inch by inch around the wheel and see the same view over and over again. You can get a great view for an entire day if you just check into any of the good hotels nearby. Skip this.,,,
,,Vacation,4,,You can have a nice and complete view from all the city. There were few people in the queue to enter so we get to the cabin quickly. The cabins have air conditioning and they are very clean. The price is a lil bit expensive for just one ride.,,,
,,A BIG YES!!,5,,This was an experience of lifetime for us. The way entry n exit to the moving capsule is managed is highly professional. The views are astounding. Once inside the capsule you wont want to come out. Its a must must must visit in Singapore. Book in advance and skip the line.,,,
,,View the whole city,5,,"It's amazing because you can see from the top the city and all the lights - is most spectacular in the evening. You must pay 33 SGD, which is not so expensive for the landscape view and the memories ! Is a must !",,,
,,Sight seeing,3,,"It's very beautiful flyer and nice too see the view from the flyer, especially at night. But the wheel is spinning too slow, make us a litte bit boring.",,,
,,More than what we bargain ...,4,,"Nearby food court. Didn't know the Satay, fry rice and chicken wings taste better to eat it this way 馃檲馃檲",,,
,,Spinning Wheel Sprouting From A Tropical Garden,4,,"An eye in the sky. Half an hour rotation per ride. Aierial view of surrounds... most of the business district ... and of course, the iconic Marina Bay Sands. Safe, steady, spacious cabin.

Peripheral offerings include dinning outlets, VIP Lounge, garden walk with koi pond and walkway bridges, Souvenir outlet. At the fringe is the Singapore River.

Accessible via taxi and MRT.

When visiting, the Singapore Flyer was decked out to welcome Singapore's 52nd National Day. Cool.",,,
,,Must visit,5,,The singapore flyer is a great experience. It will give you 360 degree areal view of Singapore. 40 minutes very slow ride is sufficient to have enough views and fun.,,,
,,beautiful!,5,,"beautiful view of the city! they say dinner could also be served here, im not sure. but it was indeed a lovely ride, and a beautiful concept for travellers. loved it!",,,
,,Great views over the city,4,,Would recommend this to anyone to do - especially at night. Takes around half an hour to complete and you get great views over the city.,,,
,,Pricey but a great view!,5,,"A little pricey but you certainly get a great view of the city! Each time I visit Singapore I seem to get back here. As a plus, if you're in town for the F1, you get a one of a kind view of the starting grid!",,,
,,Fly high,4,,Singapore flyer was very gud ..although it goes very slow but it is a different experience to see Singapore from different angle.Singapore flyer looks amazing specially at night with beautiful lighting effect .,,,
,,Great view from the flyer,5,,"Incase u have missed a few attractions like Cloud forest, gardens by the bay etc due to time constraints - Singapore Flyer is the place to go. Half hr ride . Amazing views from the top. My Kid loved this",,,
,,Holidays,4,,Terrified of heights and I went on it!!! What can I say see everything from a great spot. Went on dusk so that I could see all the lights. Shame I had to have a seat as got scared when at the top.,,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Nice buses with ample space so that you can sit comfortably and view the City Lights with ease. 33 SGD per adult so not very expensive considering its Singapore we are talking about. Best time to go there is near sunset so that you can see the city at night and day.,,,
,,Good value,5,,Amazing way to see the city. Nice freindly staff. We could see the lighting and speakers for the F1. being setup around the area.,,,
,,Awesome - If only people would not stand in the way of the view all the time,4,,"It was truly awesome to see Singapore from up there. The cars are big and comfortable and the panoramic vistas are something to behold. Apart from a couple of muppets who thought it was OK to stand in front of the windows for too long, it was great. I'd definitely do it again.",,,
,,Family vacca,5,,"Very nice place to visit. Advise to Visit around weekday, there is a chance for you or you and your family be in one big tube without sharing with others. The view is breathtaking, must see.",,,
,,Slow trip to panarama,5,,"We had a great slow trip on the Flyer and was treated to some exhilarating views of 360 degree Singapore, a camera smorgasbord.",,,
,,it was lovely,5,,you have to try this. its very safe. and well maintained. the capsule is excellent. it doesnt stop. you have to get it while its moving and get down while its moving offcourse there are staff to handle that. not to worry.,,,
,,Nice views,4,,Although the flyer is a bit pricey it is still a nice thing to do in Singapore one time. The views over the city are stunning and since it's air conditioned the ride is very comfortable.,,,
,,Well worth the money,4,,We went after dark and it was fabulous to see all the lights. Especially the trees in the Gardens by the Bay,,,
,,Lots of wow,5,,"The big wheel is great fun, particularly for little kids.

You can see for ever and it's really well completed by the gardens by the bay.

We were lucky enough to see the rehearsal for the National Day while we were on the flyer. Very cool.

Go on weekdays early on to avoid big crowds.",,,
,,Nothing great.,2,,You can get better view from other places than wasting time n money here.it use to be great attraction till the IR came.now you may want to go to the sky deck of marina Bay Sands for a splendid view.kids under six years may enjoy the flyer.its a half an hour slow ride.,,,
,,Mrs,4,,Very hard for me to get on as I'm very scared of heights but I did it. Great views well worth doing it.,,,
,,Great view of Singapore,4,,"The flyer was a good experience only for the view. We went when it was already dark and took in a lot of lights, more than identifying sites. Hardly felt any movement because of the slow speed. Could have given it a miss for more time at more exciting sites.",,,
,,Not Really my Thing,3,,"I went to this attraction because my friend wanted to go. For me, I would rather have bought two beers with the $33 (well you can almost get two beers for 拢33) Singapore that it cost. Plenty noisy children and pushy adults. If you like night time city views it's for you.",,,
,,A little scary but fun!,4,,"The ride is about 40 minutes, and for me was a little scary but fun. The cabin is pretty wide and you get to sit with the person or group you are with, no strangers. You can catch views of the city and skyline!",,,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,"- The Singapore Flyer is a giant Ferris wheel in Singapore I went on a Tuesday morning so no queue at all.
- Interesting fact about Singapore Flyer is it has a total height of 541 feet, the Singapore Flyer is the tallest Ferris wheel in the world and you鈥檒l be able to spot landmarks up to 45 kilometers away.
- We had our breakfast and heads towards MRT for this beautiful attraction of Singapore.
- We were so excited for Flyer and the pathway from Promenade MRT is very beautiful.
- It was a approximately 30 minutes rotation.
- We were only four persons inside the huge capsule and it is big enough to accommodate 28 persons.
- From distance me and my wife felt that it is stopped but it was not true actually its rotation is very slow.
- At ground floor there is a very nice food court and a very relaxing rainforest area behind.
- Worth going! Any time of the day is perfect time to take a ride here, visiting such a place is one of the things you will never regret

How to reach by MRT Train:
Take a Circle Line MRT train to Promenade Station and take Exit A after alighting the train. When you are out of the station, you will see a junction on your left. Cross the junction and take on Temasek Avenue. When you come to the next junction, you will see the flyer on your left. It shouldn't take you more than 10 minutes to reach there.

Tickets: Adults 33SGD, Child 21SGD

Address: 30 Raffles Ave, Singapore 039803",,,
,,Very high!,4,,This was a great experience and even though I'm reasonably afraid of heights I felt okay on this as long as I didn't look down! It takes half an hour to go fully round so you can plan around this event really easily. We left Clarke Quay in a river boat down Singapore River then walked about 10 mins to the Flyer. It was about 6pm on Friday night and there was no que to get on. There are wonderful views of Singapore and great photo opportunities both inside and out of the flyer capsule. Kids loved it.....and once we got on even they were a little afraid!,,,
,,Breathtaking night,5,,I was there at night-time and the view of the city with all the lights on were just amazing; no words to describe that specific moment. I think it's better to go at night time instead during the day. All the compartments are air-conditioned.,,,
,,Back after 8 years and even better.,5,,"We were amazed how many more buildings, including the Marina Sands Boat hotel, had been completed. Also the view to the gardens and the Cloud were now complete. Recommended to get an overall view of Singapore.",,,
,,Best Views Of Singapore,4,,"Great way to see all the sights of Singapore. Very well run, right from the ticket lady to staff that help you get on & off. Very cheerful. Would recommend this attraction.",,,
,,Slow trip for view,3,,If you want to see cityscape from a height you are better going to Marina Bay Skypark. Kids may like it but just average to me.,,,
,,"Amazing view, worth visiting!",4,,"A beautiful view over the city. Very pleasant ride with good 360 degrees view. Bit expensive (like most of the popular sights in the city), but worth the money though.",,,
,,It will make you crazy but....,5,,"""It was big wheel"" I thought in my mind when i came for the first time. Wooww amazing. I think it looks really scary to ride. But, after you ride this, you wont never imagine how beautiful singapore when you see on the top of the flyer. And I suggest you to ride this on night. It was really a good sight from the top of flyer",,,
,,Good Ride,5,,I think world second tallest flyer in the world. Takes 30 minutes to complete. and cabins are air condtioned.,,,
,,Amazing,5,,A great experience to see the entire Singapore from the top of the flyer. Seeing the sun set up there was just amazing.,,,
,,Great views for everyone!,4,,"We've tried the Melbourne star before, so this was one of the thing we knew we really wanted to do during our stay in Singapore. The Flyer is very smooth and efficient (like so may other things in Singapore). We were a group of people, including some who would describe themselves as ""height smart"" (aka scared of heights). Neither one of them had any problems with the Flyer. Might be a good thing to know. The views of the city are spectacular, and highly recommended. Also perfect for people with children, or those who have problems walking long distances. This gives a tour of the city in just 28 minutes with very little effort.",,,
,,Afternoon ride,3,,"It was a quiet afternoon, I like it but my son prefers to see more people. He said it is boring. Male uncle at retail shop a bit too pushy.",,,
,,Once is enough for life,1,,It's just a waste of time. I have heard visitors from India who were with us in the same booth to quarrel themselves over taking selfies at the top and pleading to take some fun as they are sure not to come again. This was our feeling too. The small garden at the ground is a nice reconciliation though.,,,
,,Magical View of Singapore,5,,You will need around 30-40 minutes for a complete spin. It rotates too slow so that we wont feel any danger or suffocation. The cabins are air conditioned and provide good view around. The ticket cost is approximately S$33/head for adults. its worthy enough.,,,
,,Nice sight seeing,5,,"It's my second time here. My children said this flyer is awesome. My mom is in a wheelchair, staffs were so helpfull to service us. It's an honest hospitality, thank you...",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"Wonderful views of the harbor, gardens city. We visited in the evening and it was beutiful to see all the different lights especially at Gardens by the Bay",,,
,,Magical Experience,5,,"Magical experience and perfect end to our 2 day Singapore Stopover. Absolutely amazing 360 views of Singapore, especially of Marina Bay and Gardens by the Bay. You can sit, stand or walk around in the cart. This experience was included for free in the Stopover package which I highly recommend. The ride is more of less 30 minutes. We went in the evening just when they switched the lights on at Gardens by the Bay. It was truly magical and definitely the highlight of Singapore.",,,
,,Not the highest in the world any more,3,,"They tell you it is the world's tallest but there are several taller ones now. Despite this, it is a good attraction provided you avoid the exhibits before the wheel and are not there when the tour groups arrive - usually morning and evening. Finding the ticket office is confusing and poorly signposted so offices at the river end are closed with arrows pointing nowhere in particular.",,,
,,Birds eye view,5,,"Amazing views of Singapore and its major attractions like gardens by the bay, marina bay , business hub etc",,,
,,Awesome view of the city,4,,"Singapore Flyer is a must-do for all who visit Singapore since it gives an amazing view of the city in about half an hour's time. An awesome way to look at the Marina Bay, National Stadium & other sights and the sky scrapers of the city. The Flyer also has a beautiful tropical rain forest garden which adds to its aesthetics",,,
,,Stunning Views,5,,Great views over all of Singapore. Great educational lead into the start. Very helpful and friendly staff,,,
,,Super,5,,Singapore flyer is usually on a must visit places in Singapore. It's like London eye but much bigger and gives some amazing breathtaking views of Singapore I guess best time to visit is evening where high rises in Singapore just start to lighten up . There is a ticket for it but is worth every penny for the experience. Very good and must do in Singapore visit list.,,,
,,amzing views,4,,"this is a very worth while experience, on the ascent you get to see the harbour and take in the sights. On the descent you get to view the bay in all its splendor. There is no real sense of motion and the pods or what ever they are called are air conditioned. We choose this as one of our Singapore attractions as part of the Iventa Singapore experiences.",,,
,,Great way to see the city.,5,,"This attraction is a great way to see the city. It is so large and a lovely place to have a meal.
Hop on hop off buses go right past this attraction so is very easy to get to.
If you have time to visit while there do it!!",,,
,,Great Experience,5,,Singapore Flyer is definietly worth experiencing for any tourist visiting Singapore. The views especially close to sunset are fabulous and mesmerizing. Thoroughly enjoyed with kids and family.,,,
,,A late afternoon experience,5,,"We have attempted to ride upon large ferris wheels or their like in the cities we visit. Sometime we find it impossible, but here in Singapore after an early afternoon downpour we walked from our hotel to the flyer and experienced panoramic views of Singapore.",,,
,,Here we go round...,4,,Watch a documentary on Singapore and exhibits on your route to the flyer boarding station. The cabin is large enough for a party of10 . On a clear day you can capture the view of the marina where the garden by the Bay is located. The wheeling is rather slow and will complete a round in about 30 minutes. Great for hosting a party but otherwise not a must ride.,,,
,,It's ok,3,,"We went after a meal at MBS and to be honest it really wasn't worth it, whilst the view is ok you are much better going to the sky park or CLV as the views are much better.",,,
,,Beautiful view of the city,4,,"Went there about 8-9 pm, waiting time was only about 20-30 minutes. The cart moves really slowly, the view is fantastic and it was extra funny for us, you will get a good look at Marina Bay Sands where we stayed.",,,
,,Great for special occasion,5,,We booked the Singapore sling flight and were joined by another couple. With only four in the cabin we had plenty of room to move around and get some great shots on the 30 minute flight. Access to preflight lounge was appreciated as it was still very hot that evening. Certainly an experience not to be missed however factor it in to the cost of your trip as it is one of the more expensive things to do in Singapore.,,,
,,As far as the eye can see,4,,"It used to be the biggest in the world, but it still offers great vies of Singapore and the marina. You can see as far as the eye can see. On clear days that's pretty far. Great for kids too. And it's not scary!",,,
,,Lovely view!,4,,"Its quite expensive but worth it. The ride is 30 minutes, and very slow. One gets beautiful views of the city and beyond. A good 360 degree view. A good experience. Must go.",,,
,,Well organised but plan ahead,5,,"The flyer is a 'must see' and great at any time of the day but ensure you plan ahead of going at night. Tour loads are constantly coming and going but the volumes are where impacts can occur. You get the tickets and then go and queue for the capsules; which take about 30mins to complete a circuit. It's all clearly sign posted but further distances than say, with the London Eye and its ticket hall. The capsule narrations are excellent and highlights the significance of Feng shui principles in the Flyers' location as well as areas around it. You can get a capsule photo (optional) and highly would recommend to do either on your own or with a group, but do ensure you allow an hour for all, especially if you are near closing times.",,,
,,Superb views of the city,5,,"The singapore flyer can be viewed at a fair distance at the water front. The views are amazing though the ride is a bit expensive, it is worth it. Go with your loved ones and enjoy some amazing selfies!",,,
,,Just 4 of us in the cabin!!,5,,"We visited the flyer at 9:30 pm on Sat night. We were so happy that we did not need to line up. There are only 4 of us in the cabin and we could enjoy the 360 degree of view with privacy. As we see, the staffs tend to have one group of family and friends in a cabin if possible, so better come at around 9:30 to avoid the crowd. Last entry is 10 pm and the closest MRT is Promenade station.",,,
,,Wonderful views,5,,"Find a day with a clear sky and head for the Flyer ... it offer very very nice views over Singapore. One round takes about 45 minutes and in the morning the wait is very short.

In the evening the Flyer is one of the (many) good spots for a high rise view over the city by night or in the sunset.",,,
,,Very amazing,5,,Best experience of life. Amazing view from top of flyer. 360 degree view of whole city. Good staff. Must visit when you are in Singapore,,,
,,Amazing - nothing else comes to mind,5,,"+ 28 capsules and each can fit 28 - architected with Feng Shui in mind
+ Very slow pace - no need to worry even if you are a senior citizen. My dad came along - 77 years and he had no trouble at all.
+ Marvellous architecture - can celebrate birthdays on one of the capsules.
+ Prbably the best views of the Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay
- Only 30 minutes and we are done.",,,
,,"Really cool, but really expensive!",4,,"Had a great time on the Singapore Flyer - bigger and better than the London Eye in England - but the price was very high. Good experience for photos and views, but wouldn't recommend if you're on a budget.",,,
,,Best view of Singapore and Indonesian islands,5,,"This Singapore Flyer is very good to go, as it completes one round in 30 minutes and gives beautiful views of the city marina bay and opportunity to click so many beautiful pictures! Must Go!",,,
,,A superb attraction. Safe and very comfortable.,5,,Views from the top are truly excellent. So much fun and great photographic opportunities. Don't miss this.,,,
,,Fantastic Views,4,,"My hubbie who is not fond of heights, came along for the ride with me. Very well organized from buying tickets to stepping into your pod. We felt safe at all times, lots of room to move around to see all views and directions. The pod moves so slowly that you don't miss anything. Photos are brilliant, well worth it.",,,
,,Breathtaking view of Singapore,5,,Amazing Singapore skyline with colourful lights twinkling during night time. Worth a visit as it's just simply amazing.,,,
,,Great View,4,,We have been intending to try the Flyer over our last 3 visits to Singapore and finally got to do it. Went on a Wednesday morning and found less people than expected and very short queue. The view from the flyer is spectacular and the cars are quite comfortable with central bench seats and plenty of glass for those photographs. Takes about 45 minutes to go around and worth the money. The shops and cafes in the complex are a bit basic but otherwise a good experience.,,,
,,Nice view,3,,"Expensive experience, but nice view of Singapore unfortunately we went up at the end of the day and windows were smeared with hand prints and nose prints etc making photo taking difficult and not so clear.",,,
,,Loved it,5,,This is a great way to see the city. The cars are comfortable and roomy. The movement is slow so no motion sickness.,,,
,,No WOW filling!,3,,"Big cabins for more than 20 persons, didn't see anything special.Expected more than it was! One visit more than enough!",,,
,,Picturesque view of Singapore,4,,"You can see a very good view of garden by the bay, marina bay and Singapore city from the flyer. The entry fees for one person is 33 SGD in which you get one round of flyer for 30mins. There are capsules in which about 10 people are there in each capsule. It is open till 9pm. Must visit spot.",,,
,,Great views but a little pricey,4,,"On the expensive side for what you end up getting/seeing, but overall not too bad. Access is not the easiest, since the area is relatively new so the convenience of public transport does not quite reach the site as it does the rest of Singapore. Probably best to take a taxi especially if the weather is very warm or raining.

Flight lasts over 30m but the promised views of Malaysia and Indonesia are barely more than you would expect to see at the end of the horizon. Nonetheless, views of Singapore are great, and you would not get these views without checking in to a hotel.",,,
,,Great vies of the city,5,,"Pleasantly surprised by the lack of queues and the fact that there were only 7 (ourselves and a family of 5) in the pod. Great way to see over the city and out towards Malaysia, well worth doing",,,
,,Awesome 30 minute ride,5,,Some of the best views in Singapore. Air conditioning keeps ya cool and lots to see. The only problem I had was I had to get off at the other end.,,,
,,Good,4,,"Good Time to Visit Singapore Flyer is during New year eve, they have Champagne with strawberry trip which is worth the price you will pay. Also you can witness the fireworks.

For regular tourist I will recommend to keep it as optional and not a must see attraction .",,,
,,Awesome Views of the City,5,,"I missed getting to do this on my first trip to Singapore so this is the first place I went after checking in to the hotel.

I got the tickets at the hotel so got right in line. The wait to board was short and we shared the car with a very nice family from India.

The view is awesome! The ride is smooth and comfortable.",,,
,,Nice and romantic!,4,,"Unfortunately, I didn't get to experience this with my significant other, but I'd definitely insist we go when he gets a chance to visit Singapore. The weather is pretty hit or miss and it definitely makes or breaks the whole experience. Hopefully you go when it is a good day so there is a lot to see and you can take lots of pictures. I think the entire ride is 30 or so minutes",,,
,,A great way to see the Singapore skyline,4,,Like the London Wheel Singapore has a great wheel right on the bay. It is as large as the London wheel an very easy to get to from the MRT station. The prices are low and you get about a 1/2 view of the port and skyline area.,,,
,,Top of Singapore,5,,Relaxed ride which takes you to a great height. From there you can see the entire island of Singapore!,,,
,,Iconic place of Singapore,5,,good well maintained but only thing disliked was photography was not allowed at most of places. Pricey but can not be missed. you can have look to entire city as you move up in flyer.,,,
,,Transportation system to the site is not good,3,,"It commands a panoramic view of the whole Singapore. However, owing to the hot weather in the afternoon, we sweat even inside the car. The transportation system to this site is not that good because only taxis are available. But the taxi queue is too long and we all sweat while waiting for taxi.we can't walk to the underground station as it is too hot when walking, being susceptible directly to strong sunlight.",,,
,,Not as good as expected,3,,"When we visited Singapore, the flyer was in our places to see. It gave us the view of city but it wasn鈥檛 as good aa expected. There wasn鈥檛 any wow factor in it that we suggest it to other persons because nothing exclusive it had. Also the ticket for one person was quite Expensive for the fun it gives. You can better go to other places like Universal Studios and have fun.",,,
,,Iconic,4,,Another must-see attraction in Singapore. It's a little bit on the pricey side for what it offers but one should not miss it.,,,
,,Iconic landmark,4,,Did the Flyer on our last night in Singapore and it was something you just have to do. We already had amazing views from our hotel so we had seen the vista before. If your hotel doesn't give amazing nighttime views then you must do this attraction,,,
,,Best view evea,5,,"This is the best place you should go if you want to get a great view of the Singapore skyline. You can see the whole of Singapore. At the top of the ferris wheel, you get the BEST. VIEW. ON. EARTH. They also had an awesome exhibition at the beginning of the walk to the ferris wheel. If you are a toruist in Singapore and looking for a fun experience, this is the place for you. I highly recommend this place, and if I could, I would rate this 6 stars. Hands down, you have to come to this place.",,,
,,Nice View,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is having Air Conditioned modules rotating on a Gaint Wheel, comfortable and spacious. The view from the Flyer is awesome. The ticket charges pretty high but the view is worth.",,,
,,Nice but Expensive,3,,"The view on the flyer is beautiful, but the price to get on it is rather pricey for one round of the flyer.
You get to see the entire city of Singapore, and get to spend much more at their souvenir shop. The restaurants there are also not cheap, but if you have the budget, feel free to visit the Singapore Flyer.",,,
,,Flyer,3,,Good photography. Food available. Limited. 45mins ride. Clean toilets. Taxis are generally easy to get. Yes. Recommend to visit,,,
,,Awesome place to see entire singapore,5,,"Best timevto go is around 6.30 pm. U can see both day & night singapore. Little pricey @31$. Visit after 4 yrs of my stay in here. But worth it. Try visiting on week day , less crowd.",,,
,,Great!,5,,"Great view of Singapore city, it does not matter what time you go, as day and night give you different feeing and perspective of the city. It is a must to visit.",,,
,,Amazing views.,4,,"Boosted as 20% larger than the London eye (a fact we learnt from a tour the previous day). This site is a good experience as all observation towers/wheels are.
It is placed so you can look out to the gardens, Marina Bay, the CBD and so on. The information inside the pod is limited but provides points of interest (which insistently helped me pick what we would do the next day).
The pod is very clean and we were placed in with six people. It is nice not to be crowded. It took about 40 minutes to complete and all facilities are clean.

It is priced as expected for this type of attraction, a little expensive.
Is a good way to get some snaps. There does appear to be disabled and wheelchair access. I believe they stop the wheel if requested and provide help. Where others have to step on while it is operating.",,,
,,Must try,4,,Since it is one of the best attraction and these kind of attraction is not available around the world it good to live the experience. It will take you 30 minute for the ride but the view from the top is amazing.,,,
,,Top Attraction,5,,"This is definately one of the must attractions, offering unobstructed 360 degree views of the entire harbour area.",,,
,,Worth the visit,5,,Great views over marina bay and to merlion on a clear day which we managed to bag. No queues at all when we went. Good walk from marina bay and an easy walk back to merlion park.,,,
,,Amazing Wheel!,5,,"The ride was great. If you are afraid of heights, better try this to overcome your fear. You will not feel the fear because you can stand up inside and see the amazing SG.",,,
,,Great views from up high,3,,"....views from the Flyer were good, thankfully we were there during quiet hours, so no much queuing this time. 33 dollars/person for this is not worth it imo - same views (from lower though) are available from different spots as well.

In the same capsule we also got bunch of screaming/crying kids, but what can you do.. Due to glass reflections it's quite hard/impossible to get great photos from up there, so if you're after great pics, don't bother",,,
,,Amazing,5,,Then on Ferris wheels all across the United States it wasn't until I went to Singapore that I got on one that actually amazed me. You are able to stand up walk around inside take pictures of all of the surrounding area downtown including the shipyard. Well worth the money,,,
,,Amazing night views,5,,Visited the flyer at night and enjoyed wonderful city views. I was lucky enough to have the pod to myself.,,,
,,An amazing ride,5,,Just brilliant . The view is spectacular and the ride it self is smooth so fo the faint hearted don't be afraid as you don't notice the height.,,,
,,Pretty but over priced,4,,It's pretty to look at and views are epic. Definitely just overpriced. But worth it. Especially with friends it's a nice little seclusion,,,
,,Must do,5,,Pre booked before we travelled but there is a discount if you also book the hop on hop off bus so may be worth waiting until you get to Singapore if you are thinking of using the bus (which is worthwhile). It was relatively quiet when we did it so were able to easily get on at sunset which is a good time as you get to see forever and then see the city under lights. Well worth it for the 30 minute ride.,,,
,,Awesome,5,,Singapore flyer is such a beautiful thing i had never experience such feeling and entire singapore city is visible,,,
,,Par Excellence,5,,"This is one attraction that you should visit, both during morning and late evenings. The view is just awesome. Highly recommended for friends, family, couples... almost everyone.",,,
,,Great views of the city.,5,,"Good views of the varied architecture of the skyscrapers and other memorable buildings. Also views down the river to the sea, as well as the marvellous gardens and trees.",,,
,,Great by Night,5,,"Loved this experience by night - the city is stunning at night and the Singapore Flyer only enhances how amazing this city is. The slow journey around gives you so much time to truly soak up the sights, fall in love with the city and appreciate your holiday with a loved one.",,,
,,Night flight,5,,"We really enjoyed this night time flight on the flyer, lots to see and the Singapore lights are fantastic.",,,
,,Spectacular views at night!,4,,"I've been on the Singapore Flyer twice - once during the day and once at night. It's definitely better viewing at night! At $33 per adult, it's not cheap but seeing Singapore's twinkling, colourful skyline at night makes it a memorable experience and you'll get some wonderful photos. Even if there's a queue to board the Flyer, you don't have to wait too long to get on as each capsule carries at least 20 people, though you probably won't have that many people in your capsule. The capsules are quite large, the ride lasts for 30 minutes to do a full circle and the capsule's movement is barely noticeable. If you don't like heights, you might find the ride challenging. The views at night are stunning and if you are on the Flyer when the SuperTrees do their nightly light (and sound) show at 7.45pm or 8.45pm, you will get to see the SuperTrees changing colours in synchronicity, a mesmerising sight and a photographer's dream. A highly recommended holiday experience.",,,
,,Great City View From The Top,5,,"My wife and I took a Singapore Flight in Singapore Flyer reguler option for SGD 33/person. That was a 30 minutes rotation with great city view of Singapore. The rotation of the wheel very smooth. We just enjoyed the view from the top inside the capsule and also took some pictures. You can take another option beside Singapore Flight; which are Premium Champagne Flight for SGD 79/person (You'll get finest champagne during your rotation), Singapore Sling Flight for SGD 69/person (You'll get world-renowned Singapore Sling during your rotation), and Sky Dining Flight (a menu set for two rotations in private capsule).",,,
,,Moderate,3,,"It is just okay, as you are able take an arias view of Singapore, too much time consuming. Not a must visit attraction, but you do not regret being there.",,,
,,Beautiful sight and worth it all!,5,,"Don't know why we hadn't gone before! Worth every cent, views are amazing. On a clear night like this- stunning!",,,
,,Early morning visit.,4,,Really good views and we found that our visit early in the morning around 9.30 was good too as it was clear and we had a whole car to ourselves.,,,
,,Nice,4,,Try and visit the flyer in late evening. It is amazing to see the lights of singapore skyline. Nice experience with kids and even infants too.,,,
,,A big giant wheel experience,3,,"You might not want to visit this as there are better things to do In Singapore,however if u still wanna give it a try, you may as you can see all of Singapore inside it,however most of the time is spent on clicking photos while inside the pod.",,,
,,"Fantastic Views, amazing engineering",5,,"Riding the Flyer was intentionally part of our itinerary during this visit to Singapore. We booked our tickets to the Flyer online, so when we got there, the courteous staff told us to go directly to the gates. Everything about the experience was fantastic and efficient. The nighttime view and the skyline was simple breathtaking. The engineering that went into the Flyer was also amazing.",,,
,,Great View,5,,"If you're staying in Singapore and don't have a view from hotel or visit another vantage point, this an option for you.

My colleagues visited on a cloudy night, where it had rained earlier. The view was great, we had the whole cabin to ourselves. The only small inconvenience was that were water drops on the windows and it was difficult to take photos of the spectacular views.",,,
,,A view for a kill,4,,You probably can't see the whole of Singapore but the view itself from the Flyer is enough to take your breath away be it in the day time or night time. The capsule is even big enough for some to hold cocktail parties in it. It's always a good place to bring your overseas friends to take a ride in it.,,,
,,Way better than that Pool thing!,5,,"Great way to see all of Singapore, less crowds better view, breathtaking experience. Don't bother paying for or having to deal with that pool place. This is way cooler",,,
,,Not worth the money,1,,"Just to see the view is a waste of money because it is too expensive and you are only given a 30min ride with nowhere to go, sticking in the capsule. Not worth the time. If you want to see a better view go to One Altitude (At least you given a paid drink and you can enjoy the music with no time limit) or Mount Faber which is free.",,,
,,Great views from a capsule all to ourselves,5,,"Our family of four (Mum, Dad and kids aged 5 & 8) visited the Singapore Flyer on a Tuesday evening in June.

We arrived around 5.30 and the attraction was pretty quiet, we purchased tickets (with 10% discount for presenting our SIA boarding passes) and wandered through the garden on the ground floor of the complex.
We headed up to board and were given our own capsule as there weren't many people there, I imagine it gets much busier as the sun starts to go down.

Our flight gave us great views over Singapore, high rises for miles! I imagine we could also see Malaysia. What would be welcome is a map similar to what's provided on the London Eye so you know what you are viewing in the distance.
We enjoyed viewing the formula one track up close too as it's right under the wheel.

All in all a good visit and we recommend it.",,,
,,BIRDS EYE VIEW,5,,"This giant wheel is a thirty minute ride, which gives you a magnificent view of Singapore, in air conditioned capsules, accommodating 28 passengers each.",,,
,,Not a ferry wheel,3,,The flyer itself is magnificent but it's not a ferry wheel that everyone can sit and enjoy the view in a relaxing way. People sit on one or two benches and have to stand against the window if you want to get a better view.,,,
,,An amazing Ferris Wheel Ride,5,,"We had an over night lay over arriving at 19:30 at Terminal 3 of the international airport. We were staying at the Crown Plaza at the airport, we took a taxi (about 15-20 singapore dollars one way, 20 minutes each) to the Ferris wheel. We got there around 9:00 pm and there was no line to get on the ferris wheel. They have 28 air conditioned pods, fitting around 28 passengers, we had a pod, we were a family of six adults and only had 3 other people in our pod. We loved seeing the city lit up at night, the lights were spectacular and really there is no other way to see it, you have a 360 degree view. The ride lasts approximately 30 minutes and is worth the 33 singapore dollars per adult spent. Oh the pods also change colors once on top....... truly an amazing experience.",,,
,,Amazing Place of Singapore,5,,"The most amazing and attractive place of the Singapore in the ""SINGAPORE FLYER"" having it's prime location along the sides of marina bay sands and the sea.
This giant wheel contains 28 fully air conditioned capsules and an accommodation of 28 passengers each.
The 165 meter high Singapore flyer being honored as the largest giant wheel in the world is a fair answer to the official London eye.The giant flyer is a 30 minutes ride which gives a beautiful 360 degree views when on top especially during rain. However, the flyer doesn't allow experience during heavy rains to avoid any sort of damage.
The best time to hit for a ride is during the sunset when the skyscrapers are softly lit.
One can also have a private dinner at the flyer. The hours of operation are from 8:30 am till 10:00 pm ,costing 33$ (Singapore) per adult.",,,
,,Fantastic night time views,5,,"Spectacular experience at night with all the lights of Singapore. Usually I don't like heights but this experience was fine, no problems.I loved this! Happy to pay the cost for a 30 minute birds eye view of the city.",,,
,,Good view,4,,"If you visit singapore its good to have this ride experience. The ride is nice, good view, not to crowded ( am not sure how it is on school holiday) People from kids to elderly can enjoy this ride",,,
,,Great experience,5,,What a nice way to view the city from above! Such a nice flyer! We took some amazing pictures of evening Singapore!,,,
,,Grand prix visit,5,,What took a ride on this during the grand prix F1. Amazing views of the race and its free and cool during the F1 weekend. Grab a beer and your camera and away you go.,,,
,,A Must Do,5,,"You really do get the whole view of Singapore from the Singapore Flyer. It is well worth the $33 we paid each and takes about 25 mins in total. We were lucky as there was only 4 people in our pod inc us two so just superb, a must do for those visiting Singapore.",,,
,,You can see for days!,5,,"This isn't a cheap attraction ($33 adults, $21 kids 3-12) but is well worth the visit! There was absolutely no queue at 12pm (lunchtime) on a Tuesday and we walked straight on, but if you had to queue (probably around sunset) then it would be in air-conditioned comfort, in total shade. As we left, a busload of Japanese tourists arrived, so I think we might've just been a bit lucky with timing!

We had a whole ""pod"" to ourselves - which was a blessing, as sound really does echo inside and noisy (excited) children can be abrasive (even if they're you're own...!), so I'd let someone else through if you won't be able to tolerate that and it looks like you might get paired with a young family.

The initial part of the ""rotation"" gives you a fantastic birdseye view of the F1 racetrack/pit lane below for any motoring enthusiasts followed by a great view to the Flower/Cloud Domes. The second half of the rotation provides the best photo opportunities - of Gardens, Marina Bay and CBD etc and you've had time to ""get used to it"".

The experience would be amazing at sunset, but was equally also stunning in the middle of a clear-sky day (as ours was). It's a well-oiled operation (excuse pun) and you feel very safe. There's no ""rocking"" or jolting. It's a cool feeling when you're at a similar elevation to the top of Marina Bay Sands ""boat"". I really enjoyed it and I'm usually petrified of heights!",,,
,,Very pleasant night flight,5,,"Arrived at 9:55pm in time for the final flight. Was a good experience, particularly with the best view looking back towards the city at night time.",,,
,,Excellent view of the city.,5,,We tried to time our ride so that we could experience both sunlight and sunset. But were early by 15 mins. Overall a must do.,,,
,,Best ever,5,,The view is great especially after sunset. Also it has air condition on it which is an engineering marvel. it's very interesting to see how it collects the A/C water from a round and dump it at the bottom.,,,
,,Views from different angles and heights,5,,"I visit Singapore Flyer for 2 main reasons. One to take the Giant Observation Wheel ride with friends who visit from abroad, and the other to have meals at the Chinese restaurant there. For the ride, the Singapore Flyer offers different views from different angles and heights. The speed of the revolution is just right, not too fast to make it a giddy experience nor too slow to make it boring. Knowledge of Singapore landscape would be a plus. For the meals at the Chinese restaurant, the chef can cook the dishes in the manner as you like/order them!",,,
,,Very nice tour.,5,,It was marvolous riding it. The views from it were excellent. No parallel to it. Enjoyed to the maximum extant.,,,
,,What's so special?,2,,"I just dont think it's worth it. The view is so-so, the interior inside is so-so. Maybe will be better if you book the romantic dinner.",,,
,,A must,5,,"You don't feel like you're moving, until you look down,great views and photo op,kids loved it,there can be a bit of a queue for tickets but it goes in quickly and it would probably be best to get them online,the capsules are very roomy and no obstructions for great photos.",,,
,,Average views,3,,"I was expecting to see better views of marina bay sands hotel from the flyer but it did not meet my expectation.

Although the views of the city, gardens and bay was good. Beware of long lines here especially in the hot weather which is draining and time consuming.",,,
,,Amazing Experience,5,,its an amazing experience and every tourist need to get this experience. You can see the bird eye view,,,
,,I feel the price is expensive but worth,5,,"If you have extra money to spend, you must also spend on it. It's suitable for all ages as the flyer goes slowly and convenient. But there is one thing that I can't satisfy it's not private even it is not crowded. And I prefer this for day time as for photo taking, night time is not so nice.",,,
,,"Fun attraction, long lines",3,,"Being a landmark it's almost a must to do this. Great views of the Marina Bay, racing track and super trees. The line to get in the cart is very long and with the heat and high humidity; it creates a real struggle.",,,
,,Great views....as you would expect,4,,"Of course, this trip of attraction is about the views and it doesn't let you down. Great views of the City and beyond.

We were there on a day that had a morning storm and then intermittent showers through the day. The ride was closed in the morning and the staff were unsure when, or if, it would open.

We wandered around Marina Bay and then saw the Flyer was running so walked back and got on.

A little downside is that the ride wasn't really busy, no queues, but they still filled up the cabin with a large'ish group instead of spreading across a few cabins. It seemed as though this could've been easily done and enhanced the experience. We probably should've asked for that.

We walked through the green-screen photo room before the ride without realising that was where the photos were being taken to after he ride we had to ask the photo people to take us back so we could get a photo. No dramas, they were happy to help but could've been avoided.

The full circle took 32 minutes.

A good ride.",,,
,,Great view - worth the trip,4,,My son and I loved this. Great view but not cheap! They have dinning carts (for the romantics) and Singapore Sling rides (for the well timed frazzled parents). Stunning views - not over crowded.,,,
,,30min well worth doing,5,,"The ride only takes 30min to do one full loop, and the view is spectacular. Go as early as possible as the crowds don't really show up until after lunch and evening. Really is a great perspective.",,,
,,Excellent experience,5,,"Magnificent vista on all sides, across to the financial al district skyline, the casino, the music halls, the Merlion, the F1 track, and across out to sea. Exciting experience for all the family. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.",,,
,,good experience!!,4,,good. you can see hole city in top of it.its up and down slowly so you can enjoy the cityscape very much.,,,
,,What a view,5,,Give a fantastic view of Singapore in a nice a easy pace - do it at night time - Singapore skyline and waterfront is simply amazing,,,
,,Pre book !!,5,,to save time ..pre-book this !! If not much of a tourist ..this attraction could be avoided !! The views from the top are breath taking. ..!!,,,
,,"Very good view, maybe a little expensive",4,,"You get a wonderful view from the city by going on the Singapore Flyer. And I've been a few times, and never had to queue, which is good. I would say, I'm not sure if $30 is a little expensive, when you consider the costs for other attractions in Singapore... you could go to Ce La Vie bar at the top of Marina Bay Sands and have a cocktail and see the view from there by just spending a few more dollars... but of course, if you are with children you won't be drinking cocktails then the Flyer is a good option for getting a great view across the city.",,,
,,High above the river,4,,The highest ferris wheel in the world gives you brilliant views of the surrounding area that includes Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore River. A must do.,,,
,,Nice view but slow speed,3,,"Iconic shape of Singapore skyline, but overrated.
The wheel is very slow and the initial interest rapidly changes into boredom. If you want to have a similar nice view of Singapore without being trapped half an hour in a glass cylinder, there are other good panoramic views from buildings around. Best visibility is early morning, late afternoon, windy days and after rain showers.",,,
,,Good,4,,Singapore Flyer is another good tourist destination.We Enjoy the flyer ride at evening.lighting of city is awesome at height.too good but one time.,,,
,,Great view big complex,4,,"Did the 6.30 Singapore sling tour, pretty cool and they even piped some romantic music in!! if you want to see nightfall go at 7pm - we just missed it but sunset was nice. There were a ton of people getting on at 7 so lots of people had the nightfall idea, expect a crowd. A good way to avoid it is booking one of the drink experiences.",,,
,,Great view,5,,Lovely view of Singapore from the top of the flyer. Takes about 30 minutes to complete a revolution. Worth a visit.,,,
,,a beautiful view from above,5,,"this is my first time to Singapore and i dont miss to board singapore flyer.
we can see all the city of singapore from above, thats so beautiful.
i came at afternoon, so i saw singapore clearly from above.
you must pay 33SGD (for adult). it spin around 30-40 menit.

if you come in the evening the capsules will be shining because the lights on.",,,
,,Singapore in 30 mins!,5,,"Yes! Take a map of Singapore in your hands, take the Metro train to Promenade station, walk 5 mins and you are ready! You have a set of Binoculars and that's even better. Walk into the Singapore flyer, enjoy as it climbs to the skies slowly, steadily and without noise, jerk or your realizing. I recommend you take a good mobile camera to snap away those selfies without falling over since it is safe and enclosed. The next best thing is to explore the city on the Metro or those Open top buses. But then the Flyer gives you a perspective like none other! Happy flying!",,,
,,Give a nice view,4,,Those who are going for frst tym singapore took a flyre ride ...its awesome to view whole city from the very top ..especially in night ...its worthwhile,,,
,,City from the top,4,,The view of Singapore is amazing when the flyer reaches the top. Full city can be seen and it looks mesmerizing. One circle takes upto 20 minutes.,,,
,,journey through time,5,,"see the shades of Singapore as you go on 30 min flight in capsule. wonderful and worth visiting, well maintained and nice staff.",,,
,,A must do to experience singapore,4,,"To truly understand the splendour of Singapore the Singapore Flyer gives an amazing birds eye view. From the CBD, the Marina Bay Sands, Floating parade ground, Boat Quay and as far as the eye can see... the Flyer really exposes Singapore. While the $30 seems expensive it is well worth taking in Singapore this way.",,,
,,Great view of the city,5,,It was a wonderful 360 panorama of the city in a comfortable gondola. We were a family of four and were were with other four people. It was a big gondola so it was very spacious. We moved around in the gondola and took a lot of pictures. The view was magnificent !,,,
,,Nice Experience with Good Skyline view,4,,"It's a nice experience... Capsules of flyer move so slow that you ll feel that u r still... Takes 35 minutes approximately for one round.

If u r looking at City skyline from terrace of Marina Bay Sands in your itinerary, u may skip the flyer.. Otherwise it's totally worth.",,,
,,Turning biews,4,,Lovely sites to see. Spacious room standing and sitting. Viewing over Singapore city is great. At night the wheel is so pretty to view. Interactive area is great. Line went very quickly.,,,
,,Just enjoy the view,3,,"I just saw it, not join it But it makes me happy Just suggestion ....if you want to come, maybe about 6pm or 7 pm",,,
,,discover singapore in 45 minutes,4,,ride this flyer during sunset to enjoy the beautiful of Singapore or choose dinner in board only for . dont forget to bring your camera with you.,,,
,,Must try,5,,Best time is just before sunset. The view from the top is interesting where you can see all the tall buildings and beautiful colorful lights.,,,
,,Fabulous Experience,5,,Definitely worth the effort and we all thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Very professionally operated and safe as houses.,,,
,,Imagine it would be great on a sunny day,4,,Unfortunately we went on a rather dull day with rain but this meant we were in a pod with only 4 other people. The flyer rotates very slowly and gives good views of marina bay sands and the city.,,,
,,Nothing Special,3,,Expensive Spent but worth to have it in a life time ! Actually get to see the view of whole Singapore ! No too bad for the first time customer !,,,
,,Great,4,,"I suggest you do a timelapse with your smartphone, it is so great!
You can walk around in the capsule and enjoy all the views.
The only thing i didn t like is the staff denied me accesing a different capsule when i asked because waiting in the line were a lot of kids and i didn t want to be in the same capsule with them.i was denied the option to wait for a few mins to take another one.",,,
,,Views,4,,"It was a clear day and we saw a great distance. Not a long wait and shared pod with about 8 others. Smooth ride. Some information about what we were seeing but perhaps could have had more. Being a formula One if was good to see part of the track and the pits, not signed but recognised it.",,,
,,"Great views, a must see while in Singapore",5,,"This was once the tallest ferris wheel on earth, being surpassed just recently by the High Roller in Las Vegas. The Singapore Flyer was on my to do list so when I was in the marina area I headed on over to check it out.

I already knew the cost so I wasn't surprised by the $33.00 SGD entry fee. I purchased my ticket and entered. There are displays to look at in the structure as you work your way to the flyer. Once you are at the flyer you wait in line. The flyer moves slowly and doesn't stop, the cars are emptied on the opposite side of the loading platform and you are directed to enter.

The cars are large, holding up to 28 people, there are benches in the center of the car but you will most likely be standing and changing positions to to view the changing scenery.

There is hardly any feeling of motion, the cars are tubular and are fitted into brackets so the cars always ride on the outside of the wheel.

The views are spectacular, you can literally see for miles, the cars and the glass are kept clean so you can take some good photos as long as you avoid reflections.

The whole structure and surrounding area is well maintained.

Once you exit the flyer you can take a cruise on the bay and up the river by purchasing a ticket at the booth at the dock which is close by. If you need to cool down a bit the is a gelato stand named Gelatissimo nearby as well.",,,
,,Great view of the city,4,,"Although the ferry wheel is a relatively common facility in several cities, the views from the Singapore Flyer are unique, Marina Bay, Garden by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Frormula 1 track, and Singapore river are exceptional views. The Mo毛t Champagne Capsule provides the privacy and exclusiveness. A rare experience.",,,
,,Boring,3,,"My kids were excited at first but after a few minutes, my kids cant wait to get off. You will get to see the same buildings and facade of Singapore.",,,
,,pricey,3,,not really the best but much much larger than the london eye. worth going only if you have a lot of cash to throw and love big wheels.,,,
,,Great views of the city and parts of the Formula 1 Track!,4,,"Located right by the Formula 1 track pit boxes (which you can walk along trackside)

I booked the champagne flight for my girlfriend, I picked the one just before sunset (unbearably romantic i know...) We were the only ones who booked it so we the special Moet Champagne capsule all to ourselves. Gets you through the queues quickly as well. Worth the 拢30-40. About 80Singapore dollars",,,
,,Singapore Skyline,4,,"This attraction will bring you to the top of Singapore, it is worth riding. You can see 360 deg view of Singapore Skyline.",,,
,,Nice view of city,4,,"The flyer takes about half an hour to take a full round, View from the Flyer is very good Nice Ride as well",,,
,,Little costly but nice,4,,"Well it costs $33, and it takes approx 30 minutes to go one round. I advise that people either get an iVenture card or book by Klook or Headout travel agents, to get heavy discounts. It doesn't operate in stormy weather. So just see the weather before going to flyer. In rains, it operates. Only in thunderstorm, it stops. Overall nice view from top. Huge cabin sizes, can easily accommodate you 10 people. But they send in family groups of 1 or 2 families depending on group size.",,,
,,expensive but it good for someone who never been to a flyer,3,,"Actually it just a normal flyer. But it quite expensive. Since adult ticket cost $33, a family would easily spend more than $100 for a 30 minutes ride in this capsule.",,,
,,A must see attraction,5,,If there is one thing you need to do in Singapore it is see and ride the Flyer. Great views to see where to visit next. Photo opportunities galore.,,,
,,Lovely 馃槝馃槝,5,,Beautifully designed....you can see the whole Singapore ......nothing to worry about...easy and gentle 馃榾馃榾,,,
,,Mid afternoon,3,,A little pricey for a 30 minute ride . Although all previous review mention to go in the evening we prefer to go in the daylight where we can see what there is to offer and get our bearings. We were fortunate enough to know what we were looking at but there was a couple from New Zealand first time to Singapore that had no idea and there is no commentary on what you looking at so not very good for tourist information . The cabin is not very comfortable with the hard benches.,,,
,,Just okay,3,,"Took the flyer after walking through an area where photographers insisted we have our photo taken, they wouldn't take no for an answer. Shared the pod with another couple which was nice, lots of space to move around and take photos. I wouldn't say this is anything special - apart from great views of the F1 track.",,,
,,Views,4,,"I think this is a must in singapore to really appreciate views, skyline and overall marina bay. Better appreciated during sunset .",,,
,,Up up and away,5,,"Not one for heights no worries, just sit back and you will be amazed at the sights in the air conditioned cabin. The wheel movement is so easily paced and you can just looked out into the distance without any fear this has to be the best viewing point in singapore don't miss it.",,,
,,Must visit for birds eye view of the city,5,,A must visit place. Either visit first thing in the morning or after dark. I would recommend going after dark as u can see the singapore city being lite up. The 360 degree view is breathtaking. Cost about 33SGD for head. Duration about 40mins.,,,
,,Awesome time on Singapore Flyer at night,5,,"Family and I jumped on the Singapore Flyer just before dark. Great time as once you are on top you can get fantastic photos of the city, gardens by the bay, port with all the ships. The light show was on lightning up the Lotus building. The Sands and DNA bridge. Great photos. Also aircon. Must do",,,
,,Great scenic view,4,,"It is quite enjoyable, but I thought that is was a bit on the expensive Side which probably kept more tourists from enjoying this.",,,
,,Good view of Marina bay from up high,4,,"The ticket is kind of expensive S$33 for each adult. The flyer is slow moving and it takes about 30 minutes for one whole ride to complete. The overall experience was a good one, you can see the beautiful Marina Bay very well from up high. I bet it is more beautiful in the night with all the lights from the buildings. You can even have dinner there (a dinning cart)! Maybe next time I'll do that!",,,
,,Bird eye view of singapore,5,,Amazing view .. half an hour in the Flyer... a slow moving Flyer gives different level view of Singapore .. just stunning .. doing it duri G dusk will be perfect ..,,,
,,Flying High,5,,"Have you ever wanted to be as high as you can be and see for my miles? Well if you're like me and don't climb mountains, the Singapore Flyer is the next best thing. 165 meters at the top, 45 minutes to do a full circle and the stunning Singapore views as well.",,,
,,Disappointing,3,,"Great views (as expected) but way over priced, even wuth cheaper tickets for seniors. How much more of an offering can the Flyer be?",,,
,,Ride subject to weather permit,3,,"Not the 1St time visiting this flyer. Nice 20-30min ride, place near to Singapore F1 pit stop. Able to have a stroll at the ""marina reservoir "".Mini garden within the building.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Excellent revolving ride with superb views of the city and beyond. We were very lucky to have a local person in our car, who could tell us about the city, as there is no commentary. Highly recommended.",,,
,,$33 for the 30min,4,,"I was about to spend the last hours of my trip at the Flyer.

As arriving by bus the search for the tickets were not the easiest thing.
When the tickets were in my hand I tried to skip all the ""Look at this & Dont you want to buy this"" things.
At the entrance of the ride all went smooth. Short line an into the cabin.

The views were great and the time of 30min was just right.",,,
,,Excellent view,5,,I liked that it did not move fast and gave us the time to move around and enjoy the view of the city.,,,
,,One time experience,4,,"If you are keen on enjoying the view of Singapore skyline, this might be a good place to do it. You can enjoy tea time in one of the capsules, even private dinner.",,,
,,Good view on a ckear day,3,,Recommended to go on a sunny day in the day or just before sun goes down. Good for family outing.. each Cabin accommodates 10 people and is well maintained and clean.,,,
,,Great View of Singapore During the Day and Night,4,,Great View of Singapore During the Day and Night. We went during the day and you can see the whole of singapore. it provides dining as well but I think that a bit to much where people can see you,,,
,,Great Experience,5,,"Fantastic way to see the City. Large clean, cool capsules take you around the wheel which gives you great views over the water and city. We did this tour during the day but night time might be even more amazing",,,
,,This is amazing!!!!,4,,This is great to overcome your fear of heights because the view will make you forget about how high it is!!! The view is amazing!,,,
,,"Very beautiful & Interesting, Newly wed must book a dine in experience.",5,,It gives you 30 mins time within Glass cabin and you are able to see all major building and sea around this activity. very nyc. Best time to visit is evening.,,,
,,"Good, but expensive",4,,"Very good view, but at 33 S$ per person, it is very expensive. No online deals also. Probably that is why it was not crowded at all.",,,
,,Excellent views,5,,Definitely worth a ride. It is a bit pricey as it was $100 for the family but gives a good sense of where everything is.,,,
,,Great,5,,"A good way to showcase the city , a good 40 mints ride loved it great view from the height of the entire singapore city.",,,
,,Fun,4,,Good way to see overview of city. Cabin was fairly large & offered Unobstructed views. Not much more to say. It's a one trick pony but a fun one.,,,
,,Big Wheel,4,,"Decent sized observation wheel, feels similar to the London eye although is apparently taller. We visited in the early afternoon midweek and the queues were really short, no more than 5 mins. Difficult to get a bad view of such a spectacular city and this doesn't disappoint. Great fun to see all the other places you've visited so good to go near the end of our trip. Another great angle on the super trees, the gardens and the marina in general. At the end of the day it's a big wheel and Singapore isn't short of high points to get a good view from but for a genuine uninterrupted 360 panorama this is worth it.",,,
,,Wow,5,,A must if in Singapore. Singapore visit without Singapore flyer is not complete. Can view whole Singapore. Little expensive but worth it....,,,
,,super,5,,I like singapore flyer if you want to birthday celebration so romantic in inside cabinet enjoy so wonderfull city image you can take a lot photo,,,
,,"""Nice View""",4,,An excellent way to see the fantastic view of Singapore Island. Marina Bay and the Gardens look great from the top. The movement of the wheel is so slow that you will be able to enjoy the scenery.,,,
,,Excellent Views,5,,One of the best attractions that I visited in Singapore. Great views of the bay !gardens and city. Visited early morning and queues were very short.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"The Flyer pod's are mounted out rim for unobstructed views. The pods themselves are very large, can hold up to 20 people, but we were fortunate to have one all to our selves. It was easy to walk around and get a view from every angle. The pre-bought tickets (printed at home) would not scan, so we had to find the service desk in order to exchange. Bring your receipt.",,,
,,great adventure,5,,"Nice adventure, nice views. Just after visiting it you can walk through the bridge to the gardens by the bay.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Its a wonderful experience.. Will get a wonderful view of Singapore.. Excellent facility.. The view of Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay etc is awesome from the flyer..",,,
,,Bliss,5,,This was 30 minutes of sheer bliss to sit and look at the views. We had a car to ourselves and our cameras were clicking at the beauty of the Singapore skyline. The slow movement of the wheel was very calming.,,,
,,Great observations,4,,"It is reputed to be the world's largest observation wheel, standing at 165m from the ground, offers breathtaking, panoramic views of Marina Bay, Singapore island and beyond. We were indeed glad that we finally did visit this icon of Singapire",,,
,,Ideal for a scenic view of the city,5,,"Singapore Flyer provides scenic view of the entire Singapore from various heights and angels through the continuously rotating cabins. The champagne cabin is special, in that it serves champagne and chocolate while one is enjoying the ride.",,,
,,Awesome views,5,,"Not being one for heights, I was nervous at first, but you feeel safe and get amazing 360 degree views of this beautiful city. The first time we visited it was closed due to stroms, so this can be an issue. On this trip, we were the last on before flights were suspended due to inclement weather, so they go to great lengths to make sure each flight is safe. A night flight would be the most spectacular, but we did ours during the day and it was fantastic.",,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,"For a person like me who have never even been in a giant wheel in my life, Singapore flyer was the most amazing experience.
Take the flyer in the night if possible to get the breathtaking view of Singapore in dazzling lights. This is taller than the London Eye and carry a better camera which can capture selfies at good quality.
Don't miss it.",,,
,,Totally Amazing and I hate heights!!,5,,"Did not feel like you were moving and I am a big chicken with heights. The views, I am running out of words to describe Singapore. Well worth the ride and do not miss walking around as you come out and check out the garden with the small waterfall and ponds with Koi. So relaxing.",,,
,,Might be a little pricey but worth it,4,,"The views from the singapore flyer are amazing, you should give this a chance when you get the opportunity. We during the day and was able to see the whole city. The ride was longer than expected and we were glad that it lasted that long.",,,
,,TOTALLY AWESOME EXPERIENCE!!,4,,This is our fifth time. Every time we visit Singapore we visit the flyer and our kids love it every time. Best time is at night time when you can view the city lights from above. Day time is great too. Take about 30 min for full rotation. Open Daily from 8:30AM to 10PM. Price $33SD For adult and $21SD for children 3-12.,,,
,,great view,5,,i never seen such place such during my life. great place . because of my age i could not climb but i have seen people faces who enjoyed. but bit costly when compared to Indian rupee . it is two good for honey moon couple.,,,
,,Alternate version of London Eye!,5,,"If you haven't visited London Eye, then this is the alternate version and you will feel you're at the London eye! A great view you can have a look for Singapore's most famous sites from the top of the flyer!",,,
,,Gardens by Bay & Marina Bay View Looks Great,5,,Flyer is a 45min ride. It doesn't go fast. Its slow and the size of a room. You can take pictures of the surrounding. But what you should be doing is looking at the scenic view when you reach at the top. Its a view to die for.,,,
,,romantic place,5,,"I go there at the time of sunset. Maybe in the weekday, not many people there, I cabin has only 5 people, the cabin is big, we can enjoy the 360 degree view freely",,,
,,Spectacular Views,5,,Another attraction included in my SIA Explorer pass. I was lucky and there were only 4 other people in the car with me. The views were amazing as it was a very clear sunny day. Well worth it,,,
,,Great in the day - amazing at night!,5,,"This place had some of the exhibits being renovated but it overall was really great. Easy to access and explore, the flyer was another example of Singapore organisation. Clockwork precision all the way, you jump into the capsule and survey the city scape from a unique perspective. It is really great, safe for kids and if you aren't afraid of heights, perfect addition to the tourist trail of the city.",,,
,,Eye Of singapore,5,,It is the tallest flyer in the world. It is taller than London. At top of this you can see the circle of the earth. It so fantastic place. under the flyer is F1 road. If you buy Hop on Hop off ticket you have discount to buy the flyer ticket.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Amazing view from top. Great view of F1 track. It also gives you the complete view of the Singapore marine bay,,,
,,Exciting ride,4,,"This is a must place to go in Singapore.Located in the city,you get a full view of the 'Singapore life',The Singapore Flyer is clean and comfortable,at the same time giving you the breathtaking views of the one and only Singapore.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,Went on the flyer during the evening. Price very resaonable ($33). Views were awesome. You can even book a dining pod and have a meal while it goes around.Excellent.,,,
,,Gives u a Great view,5,,U can see 2 countries at once Entire view of Singapore with port n busy channel Must visit It was raining n made view even more wonderful,,,
,,Worth a visit,4,,Like everything in Singapore you have to pay but it's worth it. In the day light you can see for miles. Takes 32 minutes.,,,
,,Not so great,3,,"Found it a bit boring. Not worth the cost. As I was with my 8 yrs old son, it wasn't any great thing to be in the flyer. Certainly you have birds eye view of beautiful Singapore but same can be done through many other means",,,
,,Brilliant Views,5,,"This is a must for night views on this large Ferris wheel, The Singapore Flyer. My niece took me on the flyer the last night of my stay and it was such a clear night to take photos of Singapore at night; a fairy land of lights with spectacular views. The capsules are very roomy and can take up to 15 people so I was told although there were only five of us in the capsule which gives clear views when the wheel turns. I have been on the London Eye in 2011 during the day and this flyer is very similar and takes about 45 minutes to go around. I think the London Flyer takes one hour by memory.",,,
,,"A bit pricy, but the view worth it",4,,It's a good place for the city scenery. Evening is the best time to visit here. The night view of Marina Bay is awesome,,,
,,adventure ride,5,,Very brilliant ride I like it so much this is good for taking photos also for riding cable car and an adventure ride,,,
,,Fantastic Views,5,,"Fantastic views on a clear day. Not overly busy so no queues and a nice 30 minutes or so spent in air conditioned comfort. Opportunities for great photos in every direction. Very close to the pit lane for the F1 Grand Prix so after the ride found myself having my photo taken outside Lewis Hamiltons garage, a nice little bonus.",,,
,,Great views,4,,A great way to see Singapore. About half an hour round trip. Moves very slowly and get 360 views. Queue wasn't bad to get on.,,,
,,A must night time attraction,5,,"Best views of Singapore, experiencing the city lights journey takes around 40 minutes, you don't feel like you are moving, even though you have to queue up , it does not take long to board, if you want something different you can have the option for dinner or drinks, not sure of the cost for those options. It was raining the night we went on it, and the lightening show was a extra bonus.",,,
,,The views are amazing,5,,"First time in one of the large ferris/observation wheels. It moves so slow you don't even feel the movement, which is good for me because I'm scared of heights. The cars are large and you have plenty or room to move around and take photos. Small gift shop at the end of the ride if you'd like to purchase a souvenir.

This is the way to see the entire city. It is beautiful.",,,
,,Nice place to visit once,3,,Compared to London Eye i found Singapore Flyer okish. Only good view wasof Gardens By Bay. Was expecting to see infinity poolfrom flyer bt was disappointed.,,,
,,Great views of Singapore,4,,"Relaxing 30 minutes ride with great views of Singapore. Large cabin with possibility to sit down. Try it during the day or during the night: different perspectives for great pictures. Worth doing, a bit expensive though.",,,
,,A must see in Singapore.,5,,It is a little expensive at 33 sng $ per adult but it is worth it for the views. Best time is at dusk when you have daylight to see the views and also the lights in the surrounding skyscrapers are just turning on. Bring your camera stunning views lasts for about 40 minutes s approx. Extremely comfortable. Recommended,,,
,,Very Big,5,,It was my great experience in flyer I went again in Singapore I will 100 visit again flyer I never forget such a good experience,,,
,,So expensive,2,,"Don't waste your money got to the zoo, water world or night/river safari instead you'll get your monies worth then. Pretty but not worth going on. You can see the same view and pay for a hotel for the night for the same price if not cheaper.",,,
,,its good,4,,"Singapore flyer is good way to see Singapore , its contain 28 capsule and cover one round in 28 minute so its slow and its good for those who have any motion phobia and you can very comfortably sit and see the city from the top",,,
,,Awesome views,4,,"We went quite early in the morning and had a cab to ourselves, so we were able to move around quite freely and take lots of photos. Wonderful views of the city and beyond. I am not normally good with heights but thoroughly enjoyed this experience. We would definitely visit again, maybe at night for a different view.",,,
,,Scenic view,5,,The view from the Singapore flyer is one of the most memorable one .Its a one time thing but do make it on your list about things to view in Singapore for sure,,,
,,One just for the tourists,3,,"Living in Singapore you probably wouldn't bother. Went with a group from work and it was like can we get off now. Yes it's a nice view and it's also nice to have in the back of your pics but that's where it ends. There are many vantage spots where you can socialise on roof top bars and take in the view without being stuck going around so slowly on the wheel. For tourist yeah why not, for travellers go explore one of the many rooftops in the area. You'll have a better time and just as good or if not better view.",,,
,,Great views but a bit pricey,4,,We really loved the views from the pods but it is a bit expensive for what it is. Fortunately we went when it was quiet and there were only 2 others in our pod. Spectacular views but not much else!,,,
,,hooneymoon trip,5,,it a roller...many cabins are made...moves slowly slowly to give a very good view of thefull city...it is not open in night...,,,
,,Enjoyable ride,3,,"Nothing was special about this attraction, only they had a good cube with beautiful views. The interesting things was restaurants inside the area",,,
,,Good views but...,3,,"Still the same experience as what I had a couple of years ago. Nice views and this time I took the ride just before sunset to capture the sunset scenery which was made more pleasant by the orangey sky. Due to the lower crowd numbers, we managed to have a capsule all to my family. The only drawback was the landscaping and facilities is more run down, probably due to less maintenance.",,,
,,A must for any visitor to Singapore,5,,We enjoyed the ride or tour on the Singapore Flyer during our visit to Singapore in April of 2017. This is a very comfortable ride in a enclosed air conditioned car. Ride moved slowly allowing for plenty of time to take photos and enjoy the tremendous view of the harbor and the city.,,,
,,Amazing views,4,,I shot some of my most beautiful photos here of Singapore and it's skyline. I recommend to go at night as the city lights are mind blowing !,,,
,,Great views!,4,,We used the flexi pass to go on the Flyer and really enjoyed the views! It takes about 30 minutes for a ride and the cars are all Windows so you get great views of the city!,,,
,,Great Experience,5,,"Its a cool way to see Singapore from the top. Flyer goes slowly, so that you can take in things around you and enjoy.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Amazing sights. 360 degrees view of Singapore. Cabins are fairly large to accommodate large group and yet give you freedom to move around to have full view. 30 minutes sight seeing is spectacular and must for everyone who visits Lion city Singapore,,,
,,Excellent,5,,"I don't like big wheels because I am afraid of heights. The fanily insisted that we go on the Flyer, then; and I am glad they did!

The pods in the Flyer are big enough for the 8 or 10 people in our pod. There are benches in there and plenty of room to wander about to admire the view and take photos and videos.

We went at night and my guess is that you get a better view than a daytime view. That's my opinion!

The wheel, the biggest of its kind in the world, takes 30 minutes to complete one revolution and the views are spectacular. The wheel never stops so you hop on and off as it moves so slowly.

I enjoyed this Flyer trip and I am sure you will too!",,,
,,Great Visual spectacle specially if you have Ride it in the evening!,4,,"Pretty slow ride for 25/30mins suitable for all (including seniors, and heart patients). A perfect selfie and a picturesque ride, which allows to capture the full glory of Singapore's Skyline in the evening. Must see if you haven't been to Marina Bay Sands viewing point or any high obeservation points in singapore.",,,
,,Highlight of the day,5,,This is amazing. Even a little higher than the London Eye and the view is exceptional. Very efficiently loaded and unloaded with friendly staff. Goes at a nice speed so plenty of time to view everything. Plenty of room in the large cabins to move around to take in all the views. An overall great experience and highly recommended.,,,
,,wasting time,2,,"It is a very big flyer with expensive ticket.Although it has view to most parts of the city,but it is not exciting at all and is very boring.",,,
,,Nice view and a good place for couples,4,,Nice 360 view of the entire marina south area and further. Its a good place for couples or even families to mingle,,,
,,Wow,5,,"Incredible views! The wheel moves very slowly giving you plenty of time to take in the spectacular skyline and the bay. It is high! Much higher than I expected when I was up there! But as the wheel moves slowly and steadily I felt very safe. There's information inside which helps you identify important buildings and more information over the speakers when you teach the top.

The views are amazing. I think the only place that might give similar views is the marina bay sands. Definitely worth a visit. Bit on the pricey side!",,,
,,Rides,5,,"I rode that before with my Aunt. But from advertisement, it can held a banquet in it. And it goes so slow, that you didn't feel it moving. It is a good place for couples or Romance.",,,
,,Good experience,4,,"Singapore flyer was definitely a must try when you visited this city, you could get a nice view from the Flyer and would recommend to join the game at late afternoon.",,,
,,Great views,5,,Pick a clear day and the views are great. We had a family of 9 and we got our own pod and all had a great time. We took binoculars to see more into the distance but didn't really need them we could see a long way out. Next time would love to go at night time for a different perspective.,,,
,,Enjoyable ride,4,,"I took the London Eye once and I could say that Singapore flyer have the similar concept. I could see some Indonesia islands like Batam when it was at the top. The cabin was spacious enough and have seats provided just incase tourists got tired.
Overall, it was good experience.",,,
,,Totally worth it!!!,5,,"If you not sure should you do this or no, do it! Totally worth it and the views are breathtaking! 30 mins of some of the most beautiful views of the city you will ever get to see. Tip - try doing it around 6:30 pm, makes for a beautiful sunset setting!",,,
,,A wow Ride,4,,A very relaxing ride 30 minute ride with a good view of the City - I am told that the evening ride gives a totally different view. Fortunately the queue was not that long and not many people meant the capsule was not full.,,,
,,Eagles EYE,5,,"explore Singapore through Eagle's eye that's describe it all , time need to visit this place 1.30 hr",,,
,,Awesome experience. Worth the price. Great views of skyline and city,5,,"We get to see Singapore from the top. The cable cars move very slowly, so in this way you can explore the view and enjoy yourself.

Lots of photo opportunities available here. We went on Monday, so crowd was less and we got an entire cable car to ourselves.

If sky is clear, you can even see Malaysia and Indonesia from the flyer :)",,,
,,good view of Spore and beyond,4,,A very comfortably seated flyer that gives a birds eye view of singapore and beyond. The guides mention being able to watch Malaysia and Indonesia too from the flyer. The ocean view is in particular beautiful.,,,
,,Impressive view on Singapore,5,,"One relax time during a business trip.
When asking a local colleague on""where to go for a nice view on Singapore"", the Flyer is immediate answers

Very nice view on city, harbour, gardens, marina bay, ..., approx 30min for a whole tour in air conditioned place.

Expect 33 S$ per adult",,,
,,Great views on a peaceful ride,5,,Well constructed quiet ride provides great views. Certainly a recommended unique experience. Thirty minute ride is well managed so wait time is as short as possible.,,,
,,Must go through the experience,4,,"Iconic structure at singapore. Visible from a distance. Catches your attention and curiosity from a distance. Once you enter the complex, the way to the flyer is great. Facts about the flyer and a lot.
Each capsule has a capacity of around 21, takes 30 min in the flight. You can see the city and nearing country from the height.
Earlier they used to give a headset in which they told what is visible. Since last 2-3 years they have stopped that.
The flyer complex also has a lot of good restaurants and is picturesque in the evening.
Very good for a one time visit. Evening twilight time is the best time of the day to visit.",,,
,,Must visit,5,,Great experience. Loved the views. Family enjoyed it a lot. It was very less crowded the day we went. So its only my family in the capsule which made it even more special.,,,
,,Scenic view,4,,Nice way to view cityscape. Went during the day but would recommend taking a night visit to see all the city lights.,,,
,,Amazing view of City light view,4,,"The experience of half an hour ride on the singapore flyer was just amazing. I was there at around 7 in the evening and was bit shocked by the queue but once i reached the flyer the view from the flyer was just incredible. The city lights, view of Marina Bay Sand and the Garden by Bay was just wow.",,,
,,Great,5,,"Fantastic views , 30 mins well spent . Friendly , helpful staff . Would recommend. Can dine in it if you prebook it .",,,
,,Heavenly,5,,"The flyer is at a walking distance from the Marina Bay, the Domes and everything else with touristic interest.
For close to 30 minutes you see Singapore from the top, but not from a plane.
From there you can enjoy the entire skyline at a very slow motion.
One not to miss.",,,
,,Nice Attraction,5,,Good attraction but very slow ride. Very nice scenic views from the flyer. Slightly high ticket prices.,,,
,,Nice place for see Singapore skyline,5,,One of the best places to see the Singapore skyline. It lasts for about half an hour. When we visited (day time) there was hardly any queue. A nice relaxing place to admire the skyline and also a break from other tiring attractions.,,,
,,One thing not to be missed.,5,,"The Singapore flyer is one place not to be missed when in Singapore. Go there during the day for an amazing view of the city as well as the sea. You will enjoy these 32 minutes and also get to see the most important places of Singapore.
Avoid going there at night as all you will see is the skyline of Singapore lit up but will miss the terrific view from the top.",,,
,,Excellent views but a very short ride for the money,3,,The views are lovely but I felt it was expensive for such a short ride. The ques were long on the day chosen so I guess that was why it was a short trip,,,
,,The bigger and better London Eye of Asia,5,,One of the best attactions of Singapore. At the maximum height we can see almost full Singapore with big buildings on one side and the sea on another. The cubicles are big enough to accommodate 10-12 persons,,,
,,Phenomenal experience,5,,This is just not an attraction to be missed. If you are in Singapore you have to visit this. When at the top you get an awesome view. One gets an awesome view of gardens by the bay etc.,,,
,,Better than expected,5,,"We took a ride on the Singapore Flyer on our last night of an 8 day stay in Singapore. It hadn't really been a part of our plans but we decided at the last minute to give it a go and we were so glad we did. One of the highlights of our trip. Well organized, a smooth ride and spectacular views. I would recommend going at night time as we did- the city all lit up is amazing and you can watch the super tree light show at Gardens by the Bay from above. Beautiful!",,,
,,Mixed Reviews,3,,The Flyer is certainly an engineering feat but could be a tad overrated. The view of the area is great but how long can you look at it? It is about a 30 minute ride and you could be onboard with 20 of your closest friends. Once is enough for sure.,,,
,,Great SG view,5,,An enjoyable gigantic ferris wheel ride with scenic view of SG harbor and some part of the city. It's a must try!,,,
,,Great view of Singapore,5,,"One should try the Singapore Flyer, you will get a good view of Singapore from above. I took up the challenge because I am afraid of height but once you are up there, the fear is gone.",,,
,,Top of Singapore,4,,We visited this place as part of group tour. It is better to visit during day as we can very well see buildings bay of garden and sea and cruises from the capsule. It's built on the basis of LONDON EYE. Almost similar structure. It takes 45 minutes for one round. Amazing views from all sides. The management is also good that not too many people are stuffed inside. Worth visit!! Beautiful garden with fishes inside as the bottom of this place. Good restaurants also around this place serving true Indian cuisines.,,,
,,Beautiful experience on Giant ferry,5,,"This is a great way to view Singapore 360 degrees. There are 28 capsules each accommodating upto 28 people. It takes about 28mins for one full turn.
One can view Indonesia islands as well from the topmost view.
We goto watch Army drill from the flyer as it was Army day in Singapore during our stay.",,,
,,Different views Day and night,4,,The Singapore Flyer is a big Ferris wheel with a specially designed capsule where you can ride in to have a stunning view of the surrounding environment. It is lighted up at night so you can capture great pictures.,,,
,,Wonderful,5,,We live in Singapore but still decided to try it out. The slow wheel definitely provides a very unparalleled vantage point of the beautiful city both in night and day.,,,
,,Great Ride,4,,"Great 45mins ride with a great view of the city! Rode it during the day and night, the views were VERY DIFFERENT! Overall a great attraction!",,,
,,great for photography lovers,4,,"Singapore Flyer is part of Singapore signatures. If you are a photography lovers, it is worth the visit. You can get amazing shots of Marina Bay Sands hotel (famous and most beautiful hotel in the city), great shots of the Gardens by the Bay. And if you have good lenses, you can shot the Merlion monument as part of the Singapore river. It's a great way to check out the city from the sky.
The ride is about 1 hour.",,,
,,Moving watch Tower,5,,Singapore Flyer is good to have nice city view. You can get better Beautiful view of Singapore. Some cabins having dining facilities. Various packages to spend time on Skye's. Try in next visit. Hope you enjoy 馃槉,,,
,,An incredible view,5,,"Wow! We were in the sunset and was amazing. The views are amazing. I think is a little expensive, but I enjoyed the views. If you have the opportunity and the money, do not hesitate to do this.",,,
,,Beautiful Views,5,,"The night before, I was able to see the view of Marina Bay from the other side (at LeVel 33). In order to see the marina from a different perspective, I opted to take a trip on the Singapore Flyer.

The ride lasts 30 minutes and costs about $36. Unfortunately with my group, there was an uncontrollable child who screamed and ran around like a crackhead, but ultimately, that is on the parents. The views however trumped even that rugrat, and at the time I went (about 7:00pm), the light from the sky coupled with the lights on the buildings paired well together.

The Flyer is now the second tallest wheel in the world, but regardless, be sure to take a ride on it if you make your way to Singapore. No trip would be complete without it...",,,
,,"Expensive, but a nice experience",4,,"Singapore flyer is expensive to visit-it was 33 Singapore dollars per head when I visited, for about 45 minutes to an hour on the flyer. A ride on the flyer in evening time makes more sense-I visited at around twilight and while the city looks pretty at night with all the lights, I'm guessing evening time would have clearer view of sights making it more fun. I wouldn't go on this flyer the next time I visit Singapore;its a one time tick mark of a sight in the city. The next time I'd probably visit the top lounge of marina Bay sands to get a view of the city at a cheaper rate :). You can get onto the flyer if you are OK spending 33 dollars per head on it, otherwise try to figure another way to get a nice top view of Singapore.",,,
,,Great view and in a great spot,5,,If you love f1 your love the views right next to the grandstand brilliant photo opportunity and for all ages when get off your right by the f1 track and the bus station for the open top bus tours so great spot if your doing all 3 sights,,,
,,Fantastic Views,5,,"This is really a must do activity whilst in Singapore. The Flyer is fantastic to take in the sights over the city, providing an awesome ability to photograph from high above everything. The view of the busy port is great giving you a real perspective of the busy goings on of the second busiest port in the world. The pods are comfy, very well air-conditioned and not crowded.",,,
,,Bird's eye view of the City !,4,,"The flyer is huge and it goes around very slowly so that one can have the bird's eye view of the city. It tends to become boring after few minutes of the climb but still worth trying it once for the huge size of the wheel, hassle free operation and the pleasant experience it brings along.",,,
,,Up up and we'll up,5,,Simply the best view of the city ever. It's a really efficient and clean attraction . Every part was fun As long as your not afraid of heights,,,
,,Incredible view,5,,"Highly recommended. Views are amazing and you get an understanding of the geography of Singapore - the boats and tankers waiting to offload at the port, the HDB'S, the Bay etc.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer for photo opp.,3,,"In Singapore pre-cruise I wanted to get some good aerial shots so we rode the Flyer.
We are lucky it wasn't crowded, only about 6 others in our capsule. I got some shots and we watched a storm coming in, but otherwise not a very exciting thing to do.
As we came off they were loading about 30 people on the next ride, with that many aboard it wouldn't have been a good ride.",,,
,,Stunning View,5,,"You will enjoy the best view of Singapore. Buying the tickets online will save you a lot of time, especially if you are visiting during the peaks hours.",,,
,,All about the view,5,,"Treat yourself to a wonderful night time view of Singapore and Marina Bay, I bought a ticket on arrival for 33 SGD and had a wonderful experience of the spectacular views which Singapore has to offer. After entering the ""pre-boarding"" section there is some information about the flyer, but I chose to skip all of this and head for the wheel itself.

If you've already done the Marina Bay Sands skypark this may not seem as impressive, and vice versa",,,
,,Brilliant view,5,,"Brilliant view of the city when in the flyer. Price good compared to other cities. Cafes/eateries and gift shop on site. Wouldn't recommend for small children, we were in a capsule with young family and the children got bored very quickly so became disruptive. It's essentially a very impressive viewing platform so unless your children appreciate a good view and can behave don't take them.",,,
,,"Beautiful Views, an amazing attraction for couples",4,,"We were lucky, because at 8pm there was no waiting time involved. We even had a cabin for our-self. Stunning views and an amazing experience. Absolutely Recommendable.",,,
,,Good location,4,,Awesome experience. Always moving. Can have unbelievable view through it. Across the country. Fascinating.,,,
,,Breath taking,5,,The view as you slowly move around is worth the price. Pics you couldnt get any way else. A must do when in singapore. Go early so you can get a pod with whom ever you are travelling with and is less crowded.,,,
,,Not disappointed by the views,4,,"Visited at around 6pm and the queue was short at the ticketing counter and entrance. The ticketing counter is located at the drop off bay and hence it will take abit of time to find if you walk over from City Hall instead.

The capsule was relatively empty at the time I took the ride, only having to share it with three other people. A tip for travellers would be to time your travel time. Choose a period where there is no one in front and behind you and you might be able to have the capsule to yourself.

The views at 6pm was clear and you could see really far and the queue after that was really long. You won't be able to catch the sunset if you board at 6pm though. You probably have to board half an hour after that in order to catch it which probably explains why the queue was so long after that. Get your tickets early or online if you want to board at the sunset timings so you can avoid the queue.",,,
,,Fly with a view,5,,"Many cities now have "" flyers "" and i alwsys like to see the world from a city flyer .
Singapore was no exception and it was clear the day we flew.
Well worth $33 SGD .
Not something I would do every visit but was worth it.",,,
,,"Expensive, but a breathtaking view",4,,"We were on a limited budget while in Singapore, but decided to splurge on the Singapore Flyer. We arrived there early in the morning, and were able to snag one capsule for just two people. This meant we could walk around and talk freely. It was fabulous! The staff were sort of friendly, and it was difficult to find the ticket booth, but apart from that I would definitely recommend a visit.",,,
,,City view birds eye .,4,,"Very large wheel or flyer,slow,nothing to fear about very safe and you get birds eye view of the city.A glass cabin take you around about 40 to45 minutes ride take photos as much you like.One of the much talked attraction .Go ride enjoy .Good one .",,,
,,Flyer,5,,"Good to take the flyer in the evening to enjoy the sunset view and the city view all together.
Each cabin can take a out 20pax , fully Aircon.
Romantic for couple.
Suitable for all even children and family.
They have a few eating places there.",,,
,,Family trip,4,,"We love it the kids r having fun and enjoy the view.. we arrived quite late so we rush to buy ticket and get in with whole family.. the view is outstanding at night time but we only see a side of marina bay sands hotel.,, the price is reasonable and if u arrived late there is no big queue.., I would recommend to anyone",,,
,,Fantastic!,5,,"This is another ""must do"" while in Singapore. When you're at the top you're 165 feet above the ground and you can see forever! We had planned on doing this at night but we had heard the lines are very long in the evening so we did it mid-afternoon and it was just the two of us in our car and several cars were empty. This is a great ride!",,,
,,A great way to see Singapore,5,,I loved the Singapore Flyer. It was a great way to see the city. The views are spectacular!!! I highly recommend spending the money to see the city from the air conditioned pods.,,,
,,One word - mesmerizing,5,,"It is one experience to soak in the beauty of Singapore from a height, sitting in one of the capsules of the flyer! It takes about 30-40 mins for one complete revolution of the flyer. You can see the Gardens, the Flower Dome & Cloud Forest Conservatories and the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel - a complete visual treat! A must see attraction",,,
,,Glad we did it!,5,,"We heard a lot about the flyer and wanted to definitely visit it. You must do it for amazing views of Singapore. You can see the Race Track, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands and a lot of popular attractions. Also, if you are a medium to big sized group, you might get a whole capsule to your group.
Enjoy the half hour round, take amazing pictures.
Note that if you do the flyer, you dont need to do the Deck on Marina Bay Sands. You get almost the same views. Can save some money on that. :)",,,
,,Awesome!,5,,"Great experience! Amazing views to be seen, and ideal for anyone of any age! Clean and amazing conditions, plus a pleasant atmosphere!",,,
,,Cruisy half hour ride,3,,"It was nice to see the bright city lights of Singapore from the flyer. Nothing too exciting but the lines were short, the view was nice and it is relatively close to all of the action.
A quick walk to the promenade MRT station.
Suitable for all ages, our ""cart"" contained all ages and abilities from toddlers to the elderly and less abled.",,,
,,What a view of the beautiful city skyline,5,,We went up just before the sun was a setting and got magnificent views of the amazing Singapore skyline.,,,
,,Wow,5,,"was a little apprehensive in going on the worlds tallest wheel, but it was wonderful, great views of course.",,,
,,Fun,5,,"They were kind and gave me the capsule to myself, Singapore Is very beautiful from above, i love the buildings so well thought out, lovey to see Indonesia from the air",,,
,,Very Good Experience,4,,"Singapore Flyer is simply beautiful, its a must visit attraction in Singapore. Excellent bird eye views from the top. It was a fantastic experience for us.",,,
,,Awesome views,5,,"When planning a trip to Singapore, the flyer is a must, the views are simply spectacular, it is well worth the 30 minutes, highly recommend for the whole family, and it is wheel chair friendly too.",,,

,,Superb ride,5,,Singapore flyers take atleast 45 min to complete the one round . You can see Singapore from the flyer . Do visit when sky is clean .,,,
,,Must visit in Singapore,5,,Even if you have vertigo or motion sickness nothing will happen to you. And do this both during night as well as day.,,,
,,Not Bad!,3,,It belongs to Singapore as an monumental...thats it. It's expensive and if you not want to wait very long you have to go early. The same overview you can have from the roof restaurant at the 3 towers. And there It's much more cosy.,,,
,,Flyer,5,,"A giant wheel Singapore flyer, just enter and have almost 40 mins of the city's view in a enclosed glass capsule, have a view of the full city from the top, click top angles and family photos,kids love it, very safe. Around 4.pm time is...More",,,
,,Awesome,5,,Visited with family. Great view from top of the wheel of Singapore and even you can see the F1 track below it,,,
,,Great city views,4,,"Beautiful 360 views of the city and the sea on a clear day including the MBS building, Marina, and Gardens by the Bay. There's lots of places to eat around the outside. I went during the day but bet the night time is stunning. Adults...More",,,
,,Great way to see Singapore .,4,,"Evening rides are better. Many ride options available and a must to do if visiting Singapore , slow but good views. Good way to get some panoramic views of Singapore. I enjoyed it.",,,
,,Great View of Singapore from the wheel.,5,,The ride offers excellent view of Singapore - Both City and the Sea.You can watch entire Gardens by the Bay. Finding Taxi is a bit difficult.,,,
,,A FLYER BUT NOT THRILLING,4,,"We rode on the Flyer on the evening of May 14,2017. Except for the panaromic view, the flyer has not thrill to offer but is worth the price",,,
,,Singapore Eye,5,,"this place is amazing and provides scenic view of whole Singapore from all possible angles.Flyer is located just next to marina bay sands,garden by the bay and Merlion so you can see all of these place from above and get awesome pics. it takes around 30min for one round and you can buy tickets online or on spot.",,,
,,get a view of the city,5,,You get a complete view of the city from this flyer. Also you could see one of the boxes from that flyer on the ground for display. It looks so cozy and beautifyl,,,
,,Beautiful,4,,Amazing view. Lots of time as the wheel circles at a relaxed pace. Must visit. You can take the amphibian bus tickets from here as well. The buses ply at regular intervals.,,,
,,Worth viewing At Top,5,,"Well it was an experience worth viewing as you are guide your self as you proceed towards the Flyers it looks standstill but it is moving at a pace which you once are in it you enjoy rather everyone enjoys it till you are top visibility improve once you are top gliding above you can enjoy the Singapore city till your eye can view which is fantastic, awesome worth your trips",,,
,,Nothing special,3,,Good way to see over Singapore but if you have been on a giant flyer anywhere else in the world then you aren't missing out if you decide to skip this. You can get views of the city in other places.,,,
,,Great view from the top,4,,This slow moving very large ferris wheel takes about a half hour for a full rotation. Amazing views-go on a clear day! Bring water.,,,
,,flying high,5,,"150 meters high, amazing night view of the bay, romantic place to go with your special one, must do in singapore.",,,
,,Great View of the bay and Downtown,5,,"If you can do it in the night, plan but expect huge crowd. We did in the morning and being a cloudy day, downtown and bay looked much fresh. Absolutely safe to move inside capsule and don't forget to make a wish at the top. Believe! Must visit in Singapore!",,,
,,Great photo opportunity,4,,Went on this during the day and it was brilliant. Makes u appreciate how big Singapore is. And on the plus side the pods are air conditioned. Not expensive and worth a go,,,
,,Great Views,5,,A relaxing view of Singapore at the end of a long day. Go at night. The city lights are amazing. Air conditioned cars make it more enjoyable.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer vs Marina Skydeck,3,,I would recommend this only if you have children who would enjoy the flying wheel experience (even then it might be too slow for their liking). The operating Staff is pretty rude there I should say. If you want a better view I would recommend Skydeck instead.,,,
,,Good view,4,,"Fun way to see some great views over Singapore. Visited when quiet, so barely any queue. Much like the London eye and actually a little higher (+30m, I think they said), although you couldn't tell, as the buildings around it are higher.",,,
,,Amazing Sunset Ride,5,,"Great experience to visit SINGAPORE FLYER. It is ""A Must Visit "" while you are in Singapore.

Best to visit in the evening around 6 - 7pm, so that we can enjoy the transition view from day to early night.

The nearest MRT/Train station is Promenade MRT station.

The Ferris wheel, or SINGAPORE FLYER as called in Singapore has 28 air-conditioned capsules, each can accommodate 28 passengers on board.

The FLYER revolves/rotates very slowly, we can take  photos as many as we like it, until at last we enjoy the view of Singapore from a height of 165m ( 541ft ) before we head downwards. All the way, we have panoramic view of Singapore.

You will surely enjoy THE RIDE.

Oh........,
One more thing to Surprise you :
You  can even order in advance to have your dinner on board.",,,
,,"Good view, something to do.",4,,I guess every city now has a sky wheel and Singapore is no exception. But I believe Singapore has the tallest one. A bit pricy but worth doing. Get on at 7:30 and see the Gardens by the Bay light show from the top down. The ride is 30 minutes.,,,
,,Flyer First,4,,"Wonderful day out to have a bird's eye view of the city. Be dazzled by the beautiful garden city of Singapore, the different architecture of the buildings and the mixed potpourri of the urban ,the characteristic heirtage buildings. The surrounding green landscape captivated all. 360 degrees view unblock.",,,
,,Great views,4,,Enjoyable ride. Well run. Great views. Dont go on an overcast day do it on a sunny day. Go in the afternoon to avoid the crowds.,,,
,,Good view,4,,"Good view of city.
Either u choose singapore flyer or roof top marina bay sands.

Its gud experience if u never been to flyer elsewre.

Perfect for date- u can opt for couple glass chamber with a bottle of champagne. But its expensive.

Can give a try.

Best timings 6-7pm or sunset wre u can enjoy both day nd night view of city",,,
,,Amazing,5,,"If you want To have a bird's eye view of the Marina Bay, this is the best mode of attraction. Safe and clean. You get to see some far away attractions as well. Worth every cents.",,,
,,Breathtaking views and a superb experience,5,,Would greatly recommend the Singapore Flyer as a must visit on your visit to Singapore. The capsules are spacious and offers magnificent views spanning all across Singapore. You can easily spend a wonderful half hour admiring the vistas while the wheel spins you around slowly..,,,
,,Good,4,,Quite good. Beautiful view from the top. It is definitely recommended. Can get a view of Indonesia from the top.,,,
,,Well worth it,4,,The views from the Flyer allows you to see the city scape as well as the incredible numbers of ships in the waters between Singapore and Sentosa waiting to load/unload. Amazing!! See if you can spot your hotel....,,,
,,Premium Sky Dining Flight!,4,,"During our honeymoon 8 years ago, my husband and I came to Singapore and as we drove from the Singapore Changi Airport, we saw the Singapore Flyer and decided we will book the air-conditioned capsule. We also heard it opened a year ago! While waiting in the queue, we also saw a capsule had people dined in it and we were captivated. However, our capsule ride was fantastic because of the panoramic view from an overall height of 165 metres! This trip my husband decided to pre-book a dinner table and we chose the Premium Sky Dining Flight! We had a waiter served us and 3 other couples. Our tables were separate and distant so we still had our space! Our lobster and vegetarian dinner lasted an hour with 2 rotations. We had entree, main, sweet coffee/tea and many photos we took on the way! This time, we saw many in the queue captivated and we felt very Special :-) Now if you're afraid of height, this experience could be good because while you're busy eating and stay seated, you can still look out and enjoy the sky scrappers, the lights and above all the relaxed ambience of the dining experience with a loved one! So like us, treat yourself. Be Special!

There's only one thing I would suggest is if you like to eat your food spicy or hot, you may like to request for some chillie, pepper or even salt when you make your booking.

After dinner we had a free entry to the Journey of Dreams which was another great experience! Overall it was a very pleasant romantic evening!",,,
,,Amazing views of the city can be had.,5,,"Probably best done at night to see all the lights. Price is ok and helpful staff, just take a taxi there and then perhaps visit the casino afterwards.",,,
,,Sunset ride,5,,"Did this at sunset, what a view! Amazing sky, aerial view of Singapore, Durian buildings, gardens by the bay etc. Loved it. Aircon cars.",,,
,,Wow this is a must when in singapore,5,,"This was a great experience really pleased we went .Fantastic view , really great One of us had a fear of heights but was easily overcome distracted by the amazing skyline !",,,
,,panaromicview,5,,It is one of the best way to see the whole of singapore skyline and also all the monumets of singapore,,,
,,You cannot skip this in Singapore Visit,5,,"In our group initially most of us were not ready to ride this as this has Hugh height and is flyer. At the end we decided to go in and it was amazing.

You have small cabins which can accommodate 12-13 people. Staff there was kind enough to give our group separate cabin. Thanks to them.

The flyer goes very slowly and at time stops in between or on top to allow you to take view/photos. View from here is really breath taking and you MUST not miss it.

In morning we visited Marina Bay sand hotel's top and in evening we did flyer visit. This was good choice as we could see both views. I will recommend to do flyer in evening / late evening.

They offer entire cabin for couple with extra price. If you are on honeymoon , you must take this.

MUST Visit place in Singapore.",,,
,,Just a view !!!,5,,"I have experienced the flyer in 2014 during day time and now again in 2017 during night time.
I would recommend to experience the flyer during the night since it gives an amazing view of the city and specially the ariel view of the entire cityscape. Please carry a good dslr which provides good night photography.",,,
,,great views,5,,"Great views overs Singapore and The water. A must do when visiting Singapore. Easy access by MRT , train .",,,
,,Nice view,5,,"Nice view over the city. The flyer is very high, and it is very comfortable to be inside. Interessting coridors on the way up.",,,
,,Amazing Singapore Sling Flight,5,,"We booked the Individual Flight Privilege package which gave us a private capsule, express boarding and a glass of hand shaken Singapore Sling each.
The boarding itself was so surreal, as we were escorted past the queues someone must have thought we were VIP's or famous because word spread quickly and people were suddenly taking pictures of us!
Once we got to our capsule the doors opened and 2 waiters were waiting our drinks, they disembarked and away we went to enjoy our Slings and the stunning view.
I highly recommend this, it's well worth the cost and for us, (as it was a late wedding anniversary treat), an amazingly romantic experience.",,,
,,Daytime ride,5,,We decided to do the daytime ride so we knew what we were looking at but I can imagine that the lights would be great at night..,,,
,,Great view of Singapore,5,,We were fearful of heights but all that disappeared once we entered the ride. Lovely views and totally safe and secure. Must visit location when in Singapore.,,,
,,Wonderful views,5,,Our first time in Singapore and what a great way to see the city. 360掳 views of a wonderful city. So much to see.,,,
,,Great views!,5,,"It was a bit of a wait to enter, but worth it in the end.
I wasn't happy with the way they shoo anyone in with anyone?
It wasn't THAT crowded!
But you can get some great shots up there, and get a better picture of Singapore.
Entry into the wheel .......different? some things were clever, some I didn't really get?
Most exciting for Children maybe.
Price was OK. After all we are in Singapore!",,,
,,Great views,5,,"My wife was initially fearful of the height and slow speed of this ride - having a fear of this type of attraction.

Once we got in however all fear dissolved. It provided lovely views and the carriages felt secure and safe. It provided a different perspective to viewing the city which was much appreciated and worth the cost.",,,
,,Great Views - If the weather's clear,4,,"This is a typical large ferris wheel type attraction, that is now becoming so popular in many big cities. This one has great views over the Singapore Bay area, when the weather is clear and a great view of the Merlion, Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Gardens by the bay. The wheel also has a great view of the Formula 1 GP track.

One of the best parts is that there is seldom a queue, but that might change at busier times. Pre purchase tickets, online to save.",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,A great way to see Singapore either at day or night. Well worth the experience. Not too crowded. Will go again when in Singapore.,,,
,,Good but slightly expensive,3,,"The view was great but it was rather expensive, around 50 SGD for the normal ride, from what I remember.",,,
,,Surely one of Singapore's top 3 attraction,5,,The first thing that hits you when you reach this place is that there is hardly any crowd. This is probably because very compartment of the flyer can easily take in 20 individuals and the whole trip can be over in less than 40 minutes which is more than enough. This means the visit can be experienced in relative peace. Almost all areas of Singapore city can be seen from this flyer. My recommendation is to take the flyer first then make a note of all the places seen from here and then chart out your visits to these places as you have your orientation right and can plan accordingly. There is a nice restaurant right below the flyover run by two elderly gentlemen and that food was pretty awesome.,,,
,,great view,5,,"no lines, not over crowded with panaramic views over the city and for a formula 1 fan a good view of the start finish straight",,,
,,Nothing really amazing,3,,Night view is not recommended. Best time to visit would be in the evening 7pm. 30mins ride on the ferris wheel ends fast. Not much shops in the vicinity.,,,
,,Amazing,5,,We went in evening around 7 view was awesome.singapore in lighting whole Singapore u can view kids enjoyed photo sections n we can see river cruise n garden by bay it was simply wow,,,
,,So Beautiful,4,,"The lighting with Singapore Flyer just simply beautiful, a MUST visit attraction at Singapore. View it with your own eyes.",,,
,,Awesome view from the top,5,,Gives a splendid view of the area. The wheel rotates slowly. The capsule reaches almost the height of the Marina Bay Sands Skypark,,,
,,Great view of the city!!!,5,,"We signed up for the Singapore Sling ride, costing double for Singapore Slings, and only got one drink. Other than that, the ride was great and we met a cool girl from Brazil.",,,
,,Amazing experience at Singapore Flyer,4,,Amazing experience at Singapore Flyer especially one must experience the ride of Singapore flyer during night to enjoy view,,,
,,Must Visit,5,,Simply Incredible Experience - truly enjoyed the ride and captured some amazing pictures. It exceeded all my expectations.,,,
,,Fantastic Experience,4,,It was a fantastic experience and can see the bird eye view of singapore city through flyer and I can recommend to the people who are visiting to singapore plz go and get experience,,,
,,We loved it,5,,Nothing is cheap in Singapore so be ready. When we went it was very quiet. The Singapore flyer i based near Marina Bay Sands so you are in the local vicinity of the Marina Bay Sands Sky Park. It was very quiet when we went but it was a scorching hot day and everyone seemed to be inside. Up on the flyer it is comfortable and you will see stunning views of the whole city.,,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,These rotating wheels are virtually in every major city and the views from some of them are nothing special. But you won't be disappointed with this one. The views from this one are fantastic. It is situated inside part of the Formula 1 circuit. The prices are reasonable and it's hassle free. It takes about half an hour to complete the revolution. The views are fantastic. Take your camera. !!,,,
,,Tourist attraction,4,,Had to go on as this is the 4th Big Wheel in the world. Great views. We went on during the day. We pre-booked before visiting Singapore.,,,
,,Good view of Singapore,4,,Singapore flyer is located near Gardens by the Bay and Marina beach sands It has 28 cars and takes 28 minutes to take a round. Cars are spacious. View from flyer is fantastic. You have a full view of Singapore. However ticket price is SGD 33 which is high..,,,
,,Excellent way to see Singapore,4,,"This was an excellent way to see Singapore. 30 minutes to go round. There was a section to walk through prior to getting to the capsule which was a bit long and drawn out. In our opinion, the information to read whole walking through this area was a little bizarre at points. However, the experience in the capsule was excellent. If going at a reasonably quiet time, you will get a whole capsule to yourself. Interesting information provided inside the capsules plus lists of landmarks that you could see. As landmarks were sometimes difficult to spot, the information on the capsule would have been more useful if it was possible to point in the direction of the landmark.",,,
,,VIP Capsule,5,,Very convenient and easy access. The view from the top is something. U ll absolutely love it. A mUst do while u r in Singapore,,,
,,amazing views,5,,"You get to spot all the main attractions of Singapore during the ride which is quite cool, enjoyed it so much and would highly recommend it",,,
,,Awesome Singapore skyline view,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is the tallest Ferris wheel in the world outside of the United States and the world's second tallest after the High Roller in Las Vegas.

At a recent visit to the Singapore Flyer, the weather was cloudy and we wondered if we would end up riding it in the rain. The weather held up. During the 35 minutes ride, we enjoyed views of Singapore's amazing skyline from different directions inside the capsule. As we took in the views, we saw a hawk hovering in the sky.

For a short while, we too had hovered over Downtown Singapore and it felt good!",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Apparently the biggest observation wheel in the world. It's just got to be done. We booked online and there was no queue when we arrived, we went straight through the exhibit and had just 6 people in a pod! Good views despite it being a bit overcast and drizzling, is probably amazing when the view is clear and/or at night!",,,
,,Wow. Awesome,5,,See Th entire Singapore from this ride. Not at all scary. Goes to a decent height. Very slow in speed. View of entire Singapore. Awesome awesome awesome. Must seeee,,,
,,Nice view,3,,The ticket is too expensive if we have a family of 4 We would not come back again unless we have overseas visitors.,,,
,,Tourist Trap,1,,"First, they canceled our ride due to weather. Second, they take a picture of us as we entered and said it was free only to find out later that they charge a fee for printing but were deceptive in saying taking the picture is free. This ride is a total scam. There are more places around Singapore that you can appreciate the view at lesser cost.",,,
,,Spectacular View of Singapore,5,,"The Flyer is similar to the London Eye. It is near Marina Bay Sands. It takes about 30-40 Mins for the full rotation. Excellent Views from the top.
Suggest one should go in the evening during the sunset. Views are brilliant with Lightings in the Gardens of Bay.",,,
,,Bird's Eye View of Singapore,5,,"Its based on London Eye...a huge giant wheel. an different experience.
best time is around 6:30 PM when half the ride you have natural light and half its dark you can see the Singapore in beautiful colored lights.
you can also have Singapore sling the signature drink with a slightly high priced ticket.
the view from TOP is a delight for eyes. a Must To Do attraction when you are in Singapore",,,
,,FLYER,5,,"having been here 3 times with different engagement, it never fails to amaze me how singapore has develop over the years, a slow 30-40min ride, try to drop by around 6.30pm to see the change from day time to sunset",,,
,,A great way to see the city,4,,"Great for taking photos a slow moving huge ferris wheel that takes up up approximately 40 stories high in a covered carriage. Able to stand and walk around at will giving you a 360 deg views of the city. some of the carriages look as though they cater for dinner reservations, decked out with tables. Prices we thought were reasonable for approximately a 30 minute viewing.",,,
,,Spectacular views of the Singapore skyline,5,,"The Flyer is one of those must go places. Having done the London Eye in 2000 I wasn't in need of another trip of this type.

However, the forces conspired to make a trip on the Flyer inevitable and I'm glad it did. We went quite late in the afternoon and got daylight views on the way up and dusk/nighttime views on the way down.

Singapore really is a stunning city and the Flyer gives you a good view of some of its most iconic landmarks.

At the bottom there is an old stile food court, where you can sample some local delights.

The Flyer is slightly off the beaten track but by no means inaccessible, it's just the heat that makes if more of a challenge than your normal stroll in the park. That said, taxis are not that expensive and you can Grab one quite easily",,,
,,Nice but not a Must,4,,"There are some bars located in some high buildings around financial district area wich are more worth a visit, and you will be served too. Also less expensive. It needs to be evacuated due to heavy winds or bad weather. ( this is on a regular base here)",,,
,,Not worth it,3,,"I would not recommend the Singapore Flyer, there are so many amazing places to go throughout the city that offer very similar views!",,,
,,ITS A MUST GO IN SPORE,5,,"took an evening ride with family, and its a must to bring my foreign clients there too! peaceful ride.",,,
,,A True Reflection of the Sights of Singapore,4,,Have been on the flyer several times and it is one of the best ways to view the skyline of a beautiful city. It gives you a great outlook on how much the city is growing. The clearer the day the better the scenery. The revolution takes approximately 30 minutes but it gives you some of the best photographic opportunities in a relaxing atmosphere.,,,
,,What a viw!,5,,"Well worth the entry fee of $33 each for adults. A guide comes with you on the slow revolving view in a spacious, very clean capsule. Cameras get a workout with the spectacular 360 degree views. It is long way up.",,,
,,Sights seeing,5,,I recommend strongly for visitors to enjoy flyer and scenenic beauty of Singapore cost $33 per adult,,,
,,Fly over Singapore,5,,"The trip to Singapore is incomplete if you doesn't attempt to roll on Singapore Flyer. Calm, peaceful and exotic rotations is exciting.",,,
,,Amazing views,4,,The Flyer has some of the best views in Singapore and provides amazing photo opportunities. Well worth the ride.,,,
,,Best at Sunset,5,,"I went to the Singapore flyer in February and the views were stunning. At sunset you can the the sea turning light pinkish orange. Overall, it is a really nice attraction.",,,
,,Bird's eye view of Singapore,4,,"Singapore Flyer is Asia鈥檚 Largest Giant Observation Wheel, very similar to the London's Eye. Standing at a stunning 165m from the ground, the Flyer offers you breathtaking, panoramic views of the Marina Bay and beyond. You may reach here through metro (MRT) line by catching Yellow Circle Line. Get down at the Promenade station and take exit A. Follow the pedestrian sign to reach there in 5 minutes. It takes around 30 minutes to bring you back with 360 degree circle.",,,
,,Top priority attraction,5,,No one should miss the flyer. It is good both in the day and night. Each gives a different experience. We visited when the rain clouds were gathering towards the city side and the views were exhilarating,,,
,,Always wanted to try it out!,5,,definitely worth doing if visiting Singapore. Great views from way up!! Very neat experience. Give it a try!!,,,
,,Flying Over Singapore River,3,,Visiting this site on the night because it was too hot on the day. But it gave better view in the night.,,,
,,Can be better,3,,"We went to Singaore for a week as a family holiday.
One of the eveni gs we went to exeperience the flyer.
The flyer is an exeperience if you havnt done it b4 but was a trifle disappointing for my kuds who tbot it was taking too long.
It basically takes one giant turn over a period of 30 minutes. We went for the regular option of a flight.
It might be a better idea to probably book for in flight dining option in the flyer.
But if you havn't seen Singapore b4 & havn't exeperienced the london eye then this is an exwperience you might want to have.",,,
,,Flyer,5,,Absolutely amazing..no more worlds..we been there 3days ago..i been on the similar in London but here is best organization no stress no presure..very excited..馃枓,,,
,,Stunning Views.,5,,My first time to go on the Singapore Flyer. Most places with this type of view are packed and long queues are the norm - not here - speedy access at a sensible price. A nice slow circular movement meant one can see all over Singapore City and it is lovely to see places from such a height. A real must if going to Singapore.,,,
,,EVEN MY WIFE LIKED IT !,5,,"It took a bit of persuasion, but my wife did agree to go on the Flyer. We both truly enjoyed the trip and the view. The super large, fully enclosed and air conditioned gondola-like car is free of any extraneous motion and easy to board. The views are awesome!",,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Simply beautiful. The view of Singapore at night was just so nice to see from the Singapore Flyer. One experience that I'll remember.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Amazing! highly recommend this as a way to see Singapore. It doesn't feel like you are moving as I was a little worried about going on this but needn't have been - just a perfect way to get a great overview of this amazing city!,,,
,,Good views of singapore,4,,A slowly rotating wheel allowed us to view the whole of singapore lasting less than one hour My husband has a great fear of heights but felt secure,,,
,,Only one round!,5,,"In this flyer you get only one round so whatever oics you have to click, just click because you will not get another round. Nice view of the bay from top. Your guide can give you tickets at a discounted rate.",,,
,,a must visit in Singapore,5,,The best view of Singapore. Almost always able to get tickets on arrival. The champagne capsule is wonderful,,,
,,Nice views,4,,There are really nice views over the whole city from the flyer. Nice experince. You can also see the dozens of ships anchored in front of city,,,
,,Must do,5,,Experienced this on our last night in Singapore and it didn't disappoint. The views were amazing. Must do!,,,
,,Beautiful landmark,5,,Location easy to find. From start i visit singapore really wanted to here. The view around flyer so beautiful. Close to merlion and marina bay sand. Try to jogging here in the afternoon.,,,
,,Awesome aerial view of Singapore,5,,"We went to Flyer during the evening time and we realized that it is the best time to take the ride.
The ride lasts for around 40 minutes and even if you are having Acrophobia(Fear of Heights) you wont realize it in the flyer, as it moves really slowly.
You get to spend ample time to get the complete surrounding view of the city when you are in the flyer.
It is a wonderful experience to view the city from such a height. At times, you are lucky enough, you will be above the clouds when the flyer reaches its top most position.

Also, the area in the flyer is a must visit. They have a nice park surrounding the flyer with the river view.
I would say, after completing the flyer ride, you can take a walk around the flyer area for getting a beautiful view of Marina Bay Sands, Singapore River. You can take a lot of nice pictures at this background.",,,
,,Awesome views!,4,,"Partner and I had a round. Was very nice , would recommend perhaps on sunset, or night time. We did the trip at about 6, so just before the sunset. Could see far in the distance. On a clear day I'd imagine it would be more so amazing. Would love to do it again to see the night lights, perhaps the dinner even !",,,
,,Average and not value for money!,3,,"Good experience, but not at the cost being charged; that cost makes it average. The views are worth seeing, but only at the right cost value.",,,
,,Fun ride,5,,Love it. Family and friends went on ride. All had fun. Great view from the top. Must try at least once. each ride is about 45 mins. So U have time to relax and chill and take come nice photos.,,,
,,Nice views of Singapore but at a price,4,,At S$33pp when we went it was the most expensive of the ferriswheels we've paid for on travels overseas. If this is too much then I recommend Ion Sky Observatory (3:00-5:30 pm) which is free. The views are nice and voiceovers informative. We went at around 9:30pm half an hour before it closed and there's were far less people there and I generally prefer night views. To get to the ticket office at this time follow the signs if one office is closed then go to the other side for the second ticket office. There's also a neat looking food court on the ground level that serve traditional Malayan food if you want a taste of local cuisine.,,,
,,Amazing!!!,5,,"Enjoyed Singapore Flyer ride with Family including Wife,2 Kids 5 Yrs and 1.5 yrs old... for Great Experience and view must visit in Late evening.One of the best destination in Singapore.",,,
,,Fine view,4,,The ride took around 30 minutes and offers pretty good view to CBD and coastal area including nearby islands,,,
,,fabulous aerial view of Singapore,5,,"A must to do to appreciate this spectacular city , if you're afraid of heights then don't attempt The Flyer - each Flyer compartment accommodates up to eight passengers all of whom can be seated comfortably , the facility is very safe and is amongst the best of it's type in the world",,,
,,Nice experience,4,,Nice experience. You can view most of the Singapore from the flyer. The view is amazing. Worth the experience.,,,
,,Beautiful View,4,,The Singapore Flyer should be on every tourist visit list. The view from the Singapore Flyer is mesmerizing.,,,
,,Spectacular views.,5,,"I'm afraid of heights but this experience was fabulous - no vertigo, felt comfortable all the way. Great place for photos of the gardens, Marina Bay Hotel, the city. Well worth the price of admission.",,,
,,Breathtaking Panoramic View,5,,"Singapore Flyer is the largest observation wheel in Singapore. It is standing at a stunning 165m above the ground. This Flyer offers a breathtaking panoramic view of the Marina Bay. There is also a wide range of shops, restaurants, activities and facilities.",,,
,,A great outing,5,,This is the first wheel I have been on that gives a walk through experience first which I really enjoyed. I was also there really early so lucky enough to get my own pod. There is commentary throughout and I thought the views were great...,,,
,,"Mesmerizing view, yet a little bit terrified of height",4,,"Well firstly, the ticket is fairly high, so not so crowded which I like. The cabin is designed for tourists to have a nearly-360-degree view of the whole city, meaning the floor is see-through glass. The only place where we cannot look down is the bench in the middle of the cabin. But if you're afraid of height then it could limit your experience a bit.",,,
,,Great view,5,,"Got there early had 4 people in one car, great view of the city and harbor. Clean and well looked after ride.",,,
,,WOW,5,,It doesn't get any better than to be on the Singapore flyer views that cannot be replicated any where else,,,
,,See whole Singapore as well as Indonesia,5,,You can see complete Singapore and even Indonesia in clear sky. We went in morning and were able to see Indonesia as well.,,,
,,Great Views,5,,A nice relaxing half hour spent as the wheel does one revolution. Great view of the marina and parts of singapore. Cost $33 per person.,,,
,,A must to be included in Singapore SIghtseeing,4,,"Singapore Flyer is worth to visit to have a look of Singapore from all heights. At evening especially, you can have different looks of Singapore in vibrant colours.",,,
,,Awesome views!,4,,We came here at night and enjoyed the night view and really liked how spacious each of the cart was. Also you can sit and enjoy the view! It is more on the pricey side though - it's 33SGD for one adult. It's not a total must see but definitely a good way to enjoy night views from atop.,,,
,,Best view,5,,"Recommended place to visit on afternoon or night , will give you extraordinary view to see at night and sunset",,,
,,Good view of city,4,,Great attraction if you want to have a good look of Singapore but you might share the capsule with strangers and be stuck with them for 30 mins,,,
,,Beautiful view and great feeling,5,,Its a great feeling and anyone scared of heights need not worry. It moves slowly and u can view entire Singapore and very scenic and beautiful.,,,
,,Nice dating with wife,4,,Recommended by others go about 7pm for the sunset view will be the best experience. Food choices are so-so only. Next will go for the duck tour with children,,,
,,Average,3,,In singapore with many highrise building this looks abit redundent. The price tag of $30 was too expensive for experince,,,
,,Nice,5,,A nice place...with a wonderful view of the surroundings..in spite of being an expensive but a must visit of you are going for tourism I only hope if they separate the cabins for families with children from childless visitors,,,
,,Go for it if you have time left on your trip!,3,,"Best place to see Singapore skyline. Moves slowly though, include this on your vacation if you have some free time. If you are a party person, go for the bars situated on top of buildings.",,,
,,One time visit but very boring,3,,Singapore flyer is only a one time visit incase you have tried such flyers in london or some other city you can simply skip. The journey is a bit long and boring but Singapore flyer is visible from everywhere in down town and marina bay area.,,,
,,Believe - You are on the top of the world,5,,The amazing giant wheel - known as the Singapore flyer is a continuously moving one. you will not at all feel the jerks or the motion. It takes around 25-30 minutes to be back... It does not stop in between - The cabins are glass closed so you can view Singapore all over from each corner,,,
,,Great viewing,4,,"The Singapore flyer was a great experience! My husband and I went in the flyer during a stopover stay in Singapore.
The flyer offers a great view and over the entire city and is not a short lived experience as it takes 30 mins for the carriage to do a full rotation.
Worth a visit for sure",,,
,,Great view of the city,4,,The Singapore Flyer provides a great view of Singapore. I would recommend going around sunset or just after to see the city lights to take effect.,,,
,,First time visit of Singapore,4,,Great activity to do for sunset between 6.30pm to 7.30pm as the great taxi driver told us. Get there by 6pm to line up and get your tickets so you can see the sunset .... if busy you will see the light display. Great first time experience to see Singapore.,,,
,,Kind of boring,3,,Great view but we stayed at the Marina Bay Sands so we had a tremendous view from our hotel and there's a lot of glare off the glass in the evening so pictures really didn't come out great using an iPhone camera.,,,
,,Sky Ride,3,,Great views from the flyer but it would have been helpful to know what we were seeing! No pamphlets were there and it was our first visit to Singapore.,,,
,,Not for me...,3,,If you enjoy being put into an enclosed space with a group of people and spun around slowly this is the ride to do. It is exactly as advertised but save your self the $33 dollars and head to the top of the Marina Bay Sands for a better view.,,,
,,See the city on this 馃憤馃徎,5,,"If you wanna see the entire singapore city in one go, this is the one for you. Located at the heart of the city, this is a must go place for a tourist on a singapore visit. Price: 33 SGD",,,
,,What an experience !,5,,This is our favorite attraction in Singapore ! Simply awesome. We went in the evening around 9pm on the same day after landing in Singapore at 5:15 pm and spending close to 2 hours at immigration counters. A perfect start for the Singapore trip.,,,
,,Orientation,4,,"Our first ""touristy"" bit in Singapore. Well worth the time and money. Great views over downtown Singapore and the Formula 1 pit lane and part of the circuit. Staff made sure the pods were not crowded, may be different if really busy I suspect. Good way to orientate yourself.",,,
,,Singapore city viewing and not a typical giant wheel,4,,"The speed is next to zero. Takes about 40 min for one revolution. It is meant for viewing from different heights and different angles, the great city of Singapore. Must experience. Paradise for photography lovers.",,,
,,A view of to be admired,4,,My journey on the Flyer was during the day so that I could take in the sights. The journey took 30 minutes from the time of boarding the gondola to exiting after one rotation. The gondola is climate controlled and is very stable to enable you to walk around during its travel to get the best view. There are bench seats available if you prefer to take a more relaxed view.,,,
,,Great View,4,,It offers a great view from the flier. Evening offers a pleasant lighting effect & scenery of Singapore.,,,
,,Ok ride... like any other ferris wheel,3,,"Beautiful view of the bay area from the top, but too expensive for a single ride.. I wouldn't go back there...",,,
,,bit pricey,3,,"Great view but it is quite pricey, one can visit either flyer or observatory, would not categorize this as a must visit.",,,
,,Spectacular views!! Well worth it!,5,,Great way to see the city / bay / cargo ships. $33 adult for a 30min ride. Brilliant view and you get both sides. Highest one in the world so it's a good travel achievement....,,,
,,The excellent view,5,,"The staff there assisted us, being older folk, and we so enjoyed the view of the surrounds such as the Formula One track and also the mind blowing traffic in the harbour waiting to unload .",,,
,,highest flying wheel as london flying wheel.,5,,"it is one of exciting place,which is enjoyable rides to every one,can see whole area of singapore city.",,,
,,Singapore Visit - Flyer,5,,It looks similar to London Eye. Good location. Have a full view of city all around. A complete 30 min. ride makes u relaxed.,,,
,,2nd trip to the Flyer,3,,"Great view, but it is pricey.. I will suggest to visit in the early evening, so that the view will be superb with sunset :)",,,
,,Awesome Giant Wheel with City View,4,,"This Singapore Flyer is one of the most marketed in Singapore tourism, the ride was around a 30-40 minute, we'd the Singapore Pass so didn't bother about the price, it's not a typical giant wheel , it moves very slowly , slab by slab till you exit, you get a good aerial view of Marina bay and city, must visit.",,,
,,The High Life,5,,If you want to see Singapore from a different angle the the Singapore flyer is the one to try it is sited on one of the bends used by the F1 race track good all round views,,,
,,Very Good.,4,,Very Good but slightly expensive @ 33 SGD pp. Nice to watch in the night only as you will find fully coloured singapore city.,,,
,,Great views of the entire city from the Flyer,4,,"Slow moving ""wheel"" that takes about 30 minutes to complete, but great views of the area and the carriage is shared by about 10-12 people but still leaves plenty of room to walk around and snap pictures. They also have a dining event where you can rent a car for drinks or dinner for the evening rides for the nightime views, but a little pricey.",,,
,,Great Views!,5,,Great views. Must visit as it give you a very nice perspective views of Singapore. It's around 25/30mins ride and in one capsule there are 10/12 people. We were family of five and each one of us enjoyed the ride!,,,
,,A bit boring,4,,Quite slow and not so much to see from this location. You not even feel it is turning ... it takes about 40 minutes for a single turn/trip..,,,
,,Superb views of Cityscape,5,,"Great views of the Seafront and City Scape. Best seen evening at 7pm... each day. when the lights are out, and added great sunset views.",,,
,,Do not miss the experience,4,,"one of the best way to see entire singapore in one shot. the experience to be inside the capsule with 360 degree view is not to be missed. We experienced it in day time but i am sure it will look beautiful during the night too. Depending on your preferences, you can visit day or post evening.",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,If you like architecture this ride is a must. Very comfortable in airconed units .Each unit fits a bit more then 10 people. The ride is very slow and you have plenty of time to take photos.,,,
,,Amazing views,5,,Absolute a must..slowly rotates to take in full view of Bay in air conditioned car. Sits right near the grand prix circuit..which my husband loved having paid for a Ferrari ride through city and around circuit.,,,
,,Amazing Night Time Views,5,,"Brilliant, lots of fun and the kids loved looking out at places they had visited. Fun to do it at night when the city is lit up.",,,
,,A Must Buy,4,,"Do visit the flyer, take the full 25 minutes ride and see the hotspots around from the top. But you must visit during day time to see the places below. During night its just lights you see which can be seen from any hill or high rise building.",,,
,,Very cool,5,,Great views of Singapore. Do not miss this if you are in the vicinity. Definitely recommend you to see this.,,,
,,Amazing views,4,,"With a flight due to depart that evening , we only had a short time to explore Singapore so we decided to take the flyer as a way of seeing as much as we could. The views were amazing. Thoroughly recommend it",,,
,,Great views,5,,"We shared our capsule with a group of about 12 people. Unfortunately it rained so not so good for photos, but a nice view from the top.",,,
,,Go and experience it,4,,"Its like seeing Singapore in a bird's eye view. If you have much time to spare in Singapore, I would recommend that you experience the flyer both at day and night time. It will give you two awesome experiences. But for me, I prefer the night view , its so relaxing and romantic.",,,
,,Flyer view Experience,5,,"Situated on the SIA bus route.
Must to visit.
Capsule with 360掳 view 165 meters above ground for a ride of 30 minutes for awesome.
Taking in the city from different angles with thrilling photos.
Options to dine are available with sunset views.
Open till 10.30pm giving you enough time to visit day or night.",,,
,,Birds Eye view,5,,The view from the flyer is spectacular. Would suggest to go during sunset so that 1 can manage both the day and night view of the city,,,
,,Wonderful place to see Singapore,5,,"I would prefer to visit this place after dark, this is rally awesome especially once you reach at the top the view is mesmerizing",,,
,,Great experience,5,,Great way to view the entire city of Singapore. All the amazing landmarks can be greatly appreciated while inside the flyer. It was day time when we availed this experience. I will definitely return to ciew the city again at night.,,,
,,the singapore skyline,5,,"even though this was NOT the 1st time i did the flyer...the feeeling was still exhilarating. the entire singapore skyline is withing your horizon and if done after the sun has set, its awe inspiring. Crazy photo ops crop in and the feeling when yiu are done with the irde is like can we do it again.",,,
,,Superb place to visit,5,,"If u gng for first time donot miss dis flyer... Superb views from cabins... Full paisa vasool ... Really loved d architure... Vp definitely gng to visit again spl for flyer... U can capture nice pics along wid family...

P.S. : Precise not to be missed visir to flyer..",,,
,,Its worth doing.,4,,Great views of Singapore. The first time we went it was a bit wet with a chance of thunder so the wheel was closed. My advice is to go when the weather is good.,,,
,,Spectacular views,5,,"In my opinion, well worth doing for the views of the Marina Bay and shipping. Well organised when we visited. You can see the F1 Grand Prix starting grid too and it is possible to walk this part of the circuit.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,"This Giant Ferris Wheels is ""A Must Go"" place in Singapore. You can walk there from Garden By The Bay.",,,
,,Great views of the city,5,,"The Singapore Flyer provides an excellent view of the entire city of Singapore- a perspective that would otherwise be unattainable. There is the usual preamble of other tall wheels in other cities, and an explanation about how it was built that is moderately interesting. The real highlight is the view itself- spectacular. Might be frightening for those who are afraid of heights.",,,
,,Great view of Singapore,3,,While it was wonderful to see an amazing view of Singapore. I would not be in a rush to go back. The ride itself is good and clean but I feel that Singapore has so much more to see and do. It cost approx. $120 for around 30minutes. If you fly with Singapore Airlines remember to keep your boarding passes to receive a 10% discount off your tickets.,,,
,,A view from the sky,4,,"We went just before sunset, was lovely to watch the Skyline changing as we went around. Great view of all to see in Singapore.",,,
,,must visit,5,,"simply superb view from the top, you can watch the whole Singapore and ride is about 1hr to complete the circle",,,
,,Great views of the city and air conditioned!,5,,What a delight to be able to see the whole city so clearly. Great thing to do in the afternoon. We were lucky to be with locals who pointed out things we would not have recognized on our own. In fact other people riding with us thanked them afterwards because they were so helpful. (In other words if you do not have someone with you who can point out the mountains in Malaysia or the fire burning towers at the end of Singapore bring a local with you!),,,
,,Great views at night,4,,"We did this at night which was very good. Plenty of room with seats inside each pod. Jus thought little expensive, hence 4 stars. However, wou,d recommend, 2nd tallest wheel in the world.",,,
,,Wonderful Views,4,,"The Flyer gives you wonderful views of this amazing city's skyline. We were able to use our Singapore Air boarding pass to gain a discount, so don't discard the pass as it will gain you discounts at many city attractions. There are great views over the Gardens By The Bay complex and of the marvellous Maina Sands building. Well worth the ride, or flight, as they call it.",,,
,,Family & Friends,5,,"Highly recommended! The Eight of us just loved The Singapore Flyer! We were lucky enough to have an entire car to ourselves, so plenty of room to move around and enjoy all the amazing views of the city, surrounds and harbour. We were impressed with the huge number of ships in harbour. This was the first attraction we visited and it helped us get our bearings in this wonderful city. The journey takes 30 minutes, so plenty of time to enjoy the sights of the river, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, The Merlion, Arts and Science Museum to name a few.
At all the tourist attractions they like to take photos to sell to you. We did take advantage of this particular offer and ended up with memorable photos with amazing backdrops including digital copies. Well worth the cost when divided by 2 families.",,,
,,Beautiful evening,5,,A beautiful evening Slightly over crowded carriage but had fun and inspiring trip. Not quite the romantic trip expected.,,,
,,Overpriced 30 minutes in a gondola,3,,and it could be marketed a bit better. The current setup gives the impression that return of investment is more important than rendering a service to curious tourists.,,,
,,Similar like in other cities,4,,"Those type of attraction is recently very popular and is in every city. This is not an exception, you pay, you go to the top, you click some pictures and that's it. The view is really nice but the wheel goes really slow. I was there just before closing so it wasn't crowded. I am not sure how it is during earlier hours.",,,
,,Good place to have a panoramic view of singapore,5,,"basically its kind of a ride the flyer is almost same as the one in london.
best for photography and to get a panoramic view of the country.
Incase of a occasion you can prior book a private capsule they can even arrange tables inside it with proper food and all.",,,
,,Visit it for nice views from the Top,4,,"Visited flyer in the evening and you got some really nice views from the top. Each capsule is pretty big and they send approx 8-10 people each. It moves slowly and you don't realise its movement.

Nice view of Singapore from top, especially of Gardens by the Bay, Harbour and Football stadium. It's approx 30 minutes ride, so better use washroom before.

Avoid rainy day if possible as it might just block your views.

Overall a nice place and must be done once.",,,
,,"Great views, worth a visit",4,,"We went on this early morning so no queues. Took about 25mins to go full circle, views are worth every penny.",,,
,,High Flyers,5,,We had amazing views over Singapore and as the pods were not overloaded there was plenty of room to view the city in all directions.,,,
,,Pleasant Ride,4,,"Try the Singapore Flyer either in the afternoon or night, which gives two distinct view of the city. However in both cases, best would be when the weather is good and clear. With the carriages air-conditioned, it is generally a pleasant trip on the way on with much to see all round.",,,
,,Beautiful View of the entire City from up top....,4,,Singapore Flyer gives an entire view of the city. The view is great and the observation panels are spacious and clear. Suggest to book the tickets in advance to avoid the long queues. A Must Visit when in Singapore.,,,
,,What A View to see Singapore Downtown,5,,"If you are in Singapore for the first time, I will head over to Singapore Flyer. It will give you a 360 degrees view of the city. From there, you can plan where you want to go around the city. It is a nice ride and the scenery is beautiful.",,,
,,Must Do,5,,"Took the kids on the flyer and they loved it. Views are great. Suggest you go early to avoid queues, as we went around 1000, and really did not have to wait for more than a few minutes. The staff are very efficient and keep the process moving well and the pods are cool and clean. Well worth a visit.",,,
,,Come fly with me,5,,The second tallest wheel gave a panoramic view of Singapore. Unfortunately it had rained before we went so some of the observation panels were obscured with rain drops but this didn't detract from the experience we had. It was just getting dark so Singapore was showing off in all it's glory. Amazing!,,,
,,Nice view at night,3,,"I took the mrt to promenade station to reach this flyer, but i can't find the blue pedestrian sign to follow like i read at their website. The walk to the flyer took about 15-20 minutes. After collecting the ticket, we went for dinner first at their food court.
The price is not really cheap like other hawker centre but the taste is quite okay.
My kid even accidentally broke 1 plate and they didn't charge for it. After finish eating, we go straight for the capsule, the queue is quite short that time, we can take 1 capsule for each family or group, there was even a couple who took the capsule alone. The flight took about 30 minutes, but on the entire flight i was seating on the bench because to afraid to walk around. The capsule is safe and steady, but i'm just too afraid of the heights. We can see the marina bay sands and gardens by the bay which was beautiful with night lights.",,,
,,Great Night City View,3,,"Great city night view but can be boring. Would not exactly recommend for someone more active like myself. But for patient people, the scenes from the flyer is great.",,,
,,Dont Miss IT,5,,"Best time to visit is when its twilight. View is awesome. Ride is about half an hour.

Please be ready with your cameras for great pictures. Highly recommended. All age group people can go. You do not feel the rotation as well as height. Its very safe and nicely planned.",,,
,,Great night photo shots,4,,We went at night.33 dollars each and the trip takes about 30 minutes. Great views of the marina area,,,
,,Great escape from the Heat.,4,,"Enjoyed the 32min journey on the Singapore Flyer. On a clear day you can see Malaysia and Indonesia from the top.
Each pod is air conditioned which is a great relief from the heat.
We did the trip during the day, would be nice at night also.",,,
,,Nice view and Slow enough to take good photos,5,,"It is one of the highest Ferris wheel in the world so if you are afraid of heights, pass...
If not, you will enjoy a magnificent view. It moves slowly so you have time to circulate and take the photos you want. I prefer to do it at night but during the day is also nice. The best is to go when there are fireworks you will have to time it well but he result is marvellous. Enjoy!",,,
,,Too pricey,1,,The attraction of Singapore Flyer is not on a must do list....group travellers r involuntarily bound to visit the attraction...Priced at SGD33 per head u hv to go through a serpentine alley to reach the cable cars....To plainly say the user fee is very high for one time use compared to the satisfaction we rcv.,,,
,,VIEWS to die for,5,,Getting up and into the Flyer was an experience in itself with lots to see on the way. The 'capsule' you travelled in was very spacious and the views were spectacular. You could see all over Singapore and there were things inside the 'capsule' to help in identifying landmarks.,,,
,,Amazing View at Night,5,,"Amazing view from the capsule for 30minutes. I saw beautiful Marina Bay and Marina Bay Sands. It's good for landscape photo and take selfie. The ticket price was SGD 33. If I have time to go to Singapore again, I would to visit Singapore Flyer again at daylight.",,,
,,Flyer,4,,You almost feel like you have to do it on holidays in Singapore. It was worth it. When we went it was quiet and the views were great. There are stalls for food and other entertainment there too. Check their website for details. Kids thought it was great.,,,
,,Ride,1,,"Boring n pricey. Not worth the money n time. There should b commentaries to interest us. Also, there should b seats so that the old n less mobile people can view in some comfort.",,,
,,Stunning views,4,,"Stunning views over Singapore, the harbour, gardens and the F1 track it is simply outstanding, it also helps to put the city into some perspective, its layout and geography. Well worth a visit, however if you decide to make your way on foot, as we did after visiting the gardens, ensure you consult a map or you have a satnav on your mobile as it is quite confusing otherwise.",,,
,,An awesome experience,5,,No trip to Singapore can be completed without a ride on the Singapore flyer. A place that gives the most magnificent panaromic view of the city. An unbelievably stunning night view combined with a bird eye's view of the most spectacular high rises makes Singapore flyer a must see destination in this magical city,,,
,,flying high,5,,so glad i got up the nerve to do it as the views were amazing.It wasn't scarey as i thought.we could really see all the great buildings,,,
,,Great one-off Experience,5,,"We visited the Singapore Flyer during the 2016 Grand Prix. We were very lucky as we had pre-booked on the only available day we could (Thursday) as it is not available to the average joe on the Fri-Sun at night.

We booked the Singapore Sling cocktail booth which overall we felt provided better value for money, you sign in downstairs then are brought up in a lift to the cocktail lounge before boarding. The view was brilliant and the cocktail was actually really good (much better sling than at Raffles). The whole rotation took about half an hour but it was nice at night to see the city shining and the race track outline.

Worth noting that if you attend during the Grand Prix it can be a little tricky to walk to the Flyer, give yourself plenty time!",,,
,,Not good value..,2,,Found this experience very expensive and not worth the money. We also had screaming children running around which did not enhance our experience in any way.,,,
,,Excellent views,5,,"If you're looking to obtain the best views of the city, this is the best place to get it from (or the sky deck/infinity pool at MBS). Reasonably priced too.",,,
,,Not a must-visit but not a waste if you have the time,3,,"Just went for the typical flyer round trip and was impressed but not over whelmed by the views.

Unfortunately due to the design, many pictures will be spoiled by the structure of the flyer itself or by reflections at night time.

I would say it is worth doing but not a must-see. Better off visiting the viewing platform of the marina bay sands of visiting the gardens for views of the marina itself.",,,
,,A bit overpriced,4,,"The views from the top were stunning - expected actually for a giant ferris wheel. The space was big enough for 8 or was it 7 people I shared it with. Obviously not for people with fear of heights.

For SGD33.00 I think it is a little bit expensive - what do you expect anyway, this is Singapore. Forgot to time the entire experience but it must be somewhere within the vicinity of 30 minutes then it's over. Nothing truly exceptional but it was a good experience just the same.",,,
,,Great views,5,,Went on the Flyer and we were not disappointed. A great experience and were lucky it was at a quiet time - only 10 of us in a Pod and all were able to move around and get loads of photos. Worth the money.,,,
,,Amazing view of Singapore,4,,"it took 30 min to complete one full rotation. enjoyed the eagle eye view of singapore. its cool inside . you will enjoy harbour view, garden by the bay view, merlion view, tall building view, singapore roads. enjoyed",,,
,,Good view,4,,"It was 30 min ride and the view was amazing. We were there in mid-day, so there were not many visitors and we had private cabin. We were amazed by the view, but our 5yr old had different opinion....she was quite bored and asked when this ride will end :) The ride itself is in low space and very relaxing. I usually have fear of heights, but there was nothing to worry.",,,
,,Good view,3,,"This place offers great views of the city however, it is just like any other ferris wheel in a big city.",,,
,,Best Photo Opportunity,5,,"An amazing experience, not to be missed while in Singapore. The Flyer moves slowly, so you get the best photos of Singapore. The pods that you ride in hold about 10 people and there is plenty of room to move around. The ride lasts about 30 minutes and if you want the best pics, this is the spot to do it.",,,
,,Good birdseye view of Singapore,5,,Ride takes about 30 minutes and it goes slowly one full circle. Awesome views. Pod is fairly big and will not get claustrophobic people upset. Present SILK Air boarding passes for discounted travels at Flyer,,,
,,Nice view of the city,4,,"Too much if you need to pay for the entire family. Also the 40 minutes circle is a little too long, esp with a group of travelers out of India who just rather take of their shoes and put their feet on the sitting area",,,
,,Great views of Singapore!,5,,"Clean, safe, efficient, everything you expect of Singapore. We recommend you choose a clear day to maximise your viewing. We went during the day, but the night would be fantastic, I am sure. Children would love it. It replicates the London Eye, but is far more efficiently run.",,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Enjoyed the flyer.great views from all around.birds eye view of the marina bay sands hotel,and the bay,the gardens,and the city.",,,
,,Beautiful views,5,,We went on the flyer at night and the views were spectacular. We didn't even wait and just walked straight on with no queues. It's worth the look,,,
,,i suggest visit in day time ....night you can only see lights,3,,"flyer is very big from outside but once you get into cabin u feel like you are in ac car, you get full view of singapore if you go night time u can see only ligts so go day light you can enjoy and chace for good pics ,it is high priced",,,
,,Picture perfect,5,,"Upon arrival at the Airport, we purchased our tour package promo. It costs US$400 good for 3 persons. Inclusions are tickets for universal studios, hop in hop off tourist bus for over 20+ tourist destinations and priority tickets for Singapore flyer. We we're able to skip the long queue purchasing our tickets and getting into the attractions and rides. Better to have with you your professional cameras for picture perfect moments. Definitely a safe and enjoyable treat for the whole family.",,,
,,great attraction,5,,You must see this Singapore Flyer. Amazing viiew na Marine Bay. Good choice for romantic dinner or celebratin some fest.,,,
,,Lovely experience,4,,"Today we ventured to this part of Singapore to have an experience nice on the Singapore flyer.
There were no queues and the ticket purchasing was effortless. We walked up to the flyer and were ushered into our capsule. The view was good and we could see all the prominent places with great ease . I wish that there was maybe a voice over or some guide available to talk you through some of the interesting bits that we had no clue about. Over all a good morning spent here.",,,
,,An excellent experience.,5,,"Enjoying a smooth flyer ride is really exciting. It's a nearly half an hour ride. Nice big cabin to accommodate 10 to 15 people easily. On the ride from the top you can see most part of the Singapore even some panoramic view of some Indonesian island also. It's a awesome ride you can't imagine. No fear, it's very smoothly moving ride and too spacious cabin takeout all of your fear about heights.",,,
,,bird eye view of singapore,5,,excellent experience at world second highest giant wheel. singapore flyer is must experience place for tourist to singapore.,,,
,,Slow but worth it,5,,"This is the only wheel I have ever been on. Never been in the one in London or Vienna.
You get a fantastic view. The cabins are large and you need to pray not enter one with kids. But then again you can ask to hop on the next one. I did
The views of the city at night are breathtaking. Please go there. You will not regret it",,,
,,A good view!,4,,"Was a good 30 min ride and the view was fantastic. I have an insane fear of heights, hence i remained seated all the way through. It was really really beautiful!",,,
,,Fun,4,,"It kind of looked scary but real fun. Yes, it certainly is very high but the slow pace makes it fun. Unlike a marry go round, its relaxing, one can move around inside the cabin, click photos or even sit on the floor and get the perfect view. We rode at night and the lights of the Singapore bay was spectacular. The ride was little expensive but hey...you are in Singapore and here nothing comes cheap.",,,
,,Nice way to spend half an hour,4,,A little overpriced but it was a good clear day and we got a great view of Gardens by the bay having just visited it. Would be better if there was some commentary or info given during the ride,,,
,,Amazing views,5,,Went on this around 9pm on a Wednesday and there were no queues at all so literally just walked straight on. The views of Singapore in all its illuminated night time glory were amazing. I got some fantastic photos which I will be looking back on for a long time to come. I would like to have done day time as well but didn't have the time but I can really recommend the night experience,,,
,,"Up, up and away!",5,,"A night time visit after dinner. The weather was beautiful no rain and the sky was clear. Great views from within, especially of the Bay of gardens and the marina. A ticket for an adult was $33 Singapore, which is pretty much the same in Australian. The trip takes approx 30mins.",,,
,,Good for kids...,3,,"The flyer is excellent for kids, however if you are staying nearby in a high rise, well, you have essentially experienced the same.",,,
,,Only for the view,3,,"As with all these giant circus wheels popping up around the world it has more to do with the views than actually being on a ride .and it is a fantastic view ,taking the views in at night overlooking over the gardens by the bay and the mirina bay sands .",,,
,,Fun views.,4,,I guess this is a must do. A Singapore icon. Great views. In perfect condition. Only problem is that it seems to be over before you would wish,,,
,,Flyer,3,,Average with young kid because they need adventure. Little over priced. It is a small ride but weather has to be good. When we went it was bit misty. Otherwise we were told 3 countries are visible from the flyer,,,
,,Birds eye view,4,,This was our first flyer experience. We loved it. A nice overview of Singapore can be seen. We had visited in the late evenings. A must visit for families and couples.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer on a sunny day is excellent,5,,"Gained access via the Singapore Pass, total trip was 30+ minutes excellent views of the centre of town, the Marina Bay Sands Resort, the Gardens by the Bay, and the Resivoir area. Friendly staff and low crowds at opening time.",,,
,,Great views,4,,Great views of the city was a little disappointed having to share a car with some noisy children that did distract from the marvelous views a bit,,,
,,A half hour of the highest order!,5,,"We had vouchers for the Singapore Flyer as part of our package, but having done it, we would happily have paid extra for it. Great views of Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay and the amazing Marina Bay Sands. It's right on the hop on hop off bus route so really easy to get to as well.",,,
,,Excellent place to visit in Singapore,5,,"Do not miss this if you are in Singapore.

Do sit in the flyer. Its an amazing experience to watch the full city from such a height..

Also word of caution your guide will try to sell some combo of Flyer plus river ride. Do not go for the combo. River ride is not worth it.",,,
,,Very good view of singapore,5,,"Pre book your tickets before you come here so that u don't have to stand in a long line to purchase tickets.

Best time to visit would be just before sunset so that you can get both daytime and sunset time views from the flyer.

One can either do this or Marina Bay Sands Skypark. If you have been on other flyers then Marina Bay Sands Skypark could be a better option",,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Ticket has to be bought. Had to stand on a long line in the evening, however they are very very fast. As the flyer keeps moving you get on to it. The view is amazing. One room holds for many many people. There is also one cabin which you can book if you wish to have a romantic dinner. Well maintained and the view from the top is magnificent.",,,
,,A ride that should've lasted a little bit longer!,4,,"This ferris wheel is huge! I had booked a Singapore Sling flight (we are served the Singapore Sling cocktail/mocktail with assortment of nuts for 1 round of the flyer). The views it offers are amazing. Maybe, this can be substituted by Marina Bay Sands Skypark because it is located higher. But the experience of a ferris wheel was unbeatable. Plus, the mocktail was delicious.",,,
,,Great View From The Top,5,,"This is a must when you go to Singapore, it goes around slowly giving you ample time to take pictures of all of Singapore from the top.If you are in Singapore, then a visit to the Singapore Flyer is a must. The ride last 30 mins and the entire gondola (as they are called) is quite big and can accommodate 15 people atleast. if you are scared of heights, then maybe avoid but I would still ask you to go and sit in the middle of the seating area where you wont feel the height. There is also the option of visiting it in the night and getting a different view of the same things with the lighting but due to the cost it might not justify going twice. Better to take a pic of the flyer from far when it is lit which itself is quite beautiful.",,,
,,A BIRD EYE VIEW OF SINGAPORE,4,,No difference from all over the world flyer. You get to see Singapore while you are up in the sky. The whole round takes half an hour.,,,
,,Singapore flyer,4,,Great way to unwind after a relaxing meal in the vincinity...the panoramic night view did not disappoint,,,
,,Awesome evening views,4,,"This is a large wheel, if you don't like heights, but it rewards with great views across Singapore. We went on an evening and it was relatively quiet and the view was outstanding. We got there by taxi which was cheap and easy",,,
,,Nice enjoyable 30 minute panoramic view of Singapore,4,,"It's a pleasurable 30 minutes in a capsule that gives you a good view of Gardens by the Bay , Marina Bay financial district high rises",,,
,,Air conditioned and a lot higher than you think!,5,,"Air conditioned and a lot higher than you think - be sure to visit this attraction before the others in the same place, as they also give you vouchers for money off the other attractions. We got 50% of the 6DTheatre attraction and some restaurant deal too.",,,
,,Great views,3,,"I have seen so many such things so it didn't feel that great to me, but my parents loved it. For them it was a different experience going on top on a slow moving cartwheel and see the view of entire Singapore from the top. So for visitors who like seeing things from the top, this is the place for you.
If you fancy drinks, cocktails, mocktails, then you can see a similar view from Marina bay sands ce la vi",,,
,,must visit place in singapore,5,,one of the must visit place for tourists to view thw singapore city area from the top !! evening time is best to visit !! You can book a dinner at the Singapore flyer too !!!,,,
,,Sky high,5,,"a good way To see Singapore from a different angle, great views all around see how many landmarks you can spot.",,,
,,Excellent View of Singapore,5,,This is like the London Eye. Queuing was not very long and the view from the top was magnificent. The trip lasted about 40 minutes .,,,
,,Unique views!,5,,"Every skyline is different, but people often forget that every observation point gives different views too!",,,
,,Beautiful views,5,,This ride gives you outstanding views of the Bay Area and the Gardens by the Bay. Queues when we visited were very small and the views were lovely.,,,
,,"Good views, but not cheap !",4,,"Good views, but not cheap !
You will be able to have a good look at the Formula 1 track, the Marina Bay Sands Hotel is a little higher but the view is spectacular. Go there early Midday and you will probably have a whole cabin for yourself.",,,
,,Amazing sites,5,,"Brilliant view of Singapore through the ride, the crowd was friendly, the experience in itself is memorable! A must if you haven't been earlier!",,,
,,Yelagiri hills,5,,I see the yelagiri hills it was a beautiful place and it is covered by nature and flowers and there is a thriller valley ..ghost rider and it was useful to childrens..,,,
,,A view to SP & Indonesia,5,,"This wheel takes you up to 165 meters...enough to enjoy the skyline of the whole SP - and when clear skies, even the northernmost islands of Indonesia.",,,
,,The best views of the city,5,,"To start with, you have to bear in mind that you're going high, very very high. Higher than the London eye. So if you're scared of heights, forget it.
Once said that, you'll be riding towards the best view of Singapore. I strongly advise you to go by 9pm, when it's dark already and you get to see the city lights. There's AC in each of the cabins, that's a big plus",,,
,,Every City has One!,4,,If you've done the London Eye you've done this! Purely a box ticking exercise for the aerial view junkies out there. No queueing when we went and if that's the norm then the only question you have to ask yourself is 'do I really need to go on another big wheel in another city?',,,
,,Great at Sunset,5,,One of best place to enjoy sunset in Singapore is while riding Singapore Flyers. One ride approximately 30 mins. Its' completed with food square in the base.,,,
,,World's highest Ferris Wheel,5,,"...and definitely worth a visit, offering beautiful sights of Singapore's skyline, incl. the iconic Marina Bay Sands building, hundreds of ships lying at anchor in front of the harbour, etc.",,,
,,Great Views of Singapore,4,,Worth a trip to take in the amazing views. Very clean and care was taken to spread passengers between pods to avoid overcrowding. Very impressed with experience.,,,
,,Average,3,,"It's a 30 min in the capsule
Went up around 6:45pm, wanted to catch the sunset but missed it by 10 mins, the view was nice (i like the gardens by the bay view), didnt really like the city view

I feel not very value for money (it was 33SGD per ride when i went).",,,
,,A Truly Breath-Taking Experience,5,,A truly breath-taking experience. Get an experience of the Singapore skyline during the day and a view of the night light of the city at night.,,,
,,Singapore from the wheels : Wonderful view,4,,"I saw it while travelling in the city and it was very attractive. So we decided to go there and the whole experience was very nice.. It was very organised, we took the tickets(it was expernsive) and moved ahead. The pathway to reach flyer is made beautifully. I loved of it, one of my fav was "" how they display the three versions of Singapore, i.e Sigapore from a village to today's Singapore"" They have also displayed different artistic views of flyer in the forms of drawing, I totally enjoyed it.

The ride on the flyer was superb. We all enjoyed the paranomic view of the city with our own eyes without any lenses. totally loved it, The ride was for about half and hour. then we did some shopping from there :)

Recommended..",,,
,,Good for great view but not during afternoon,3,,Its to take the picture during the noon with great view but felt like an oven inside there and nowhere to hide from sun after few moment,,,
,,Birdseye perspective of Singapore.,5,,"View the magnificence of Singapore from this sedate Ferris wheel rotating slowly enough for you to alight & disembark without it needing to pause in its revolutions. ""You too can have such a beautiful city - all you need is imagination"" that's what the recorded guide explains in her sweet Asian accent to her captive audience, on how Singapore was transformed from a swamp to a mega modern city with views across Singapore harbour to Gardens by the bay & beyond.",,,
,,Normal place to visit,4,,"Nothing special scene, if you really insists to visit then I suggest went at night rather than day time. Dont expect any good view scene due to its location ....u can see the singapore river, central business district building.... Weather are damn hot if you visit in day time so just please take note .",,,
,,"The London Eye, different view:-)",3,,Great to get a view of the bay with the abundance of tankers passing through the port. Great view of the city plus the botanical gardens. Great for getting your bearings shortly after arriving..about a 30-40min trip,,,
,,A 360degree view of singapore,4,,"One can spend a good 20 minutes exploring the aerial view of singapore through the glass flyer. All the famous landmarks are visible, thus idwal to visit during the day.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer fabulous experience!,5,,A great experience and provided for spectacular views of the city and beyond. The trip allows ample time to take in the atmosphere of Singapore while you take many happy snaps. Thus is a cost effective activity well worth the price and provides a different perspective of the city. I would put this on your must do list!,,,
,,Ferris wheel over Singapore,3,,This is a sedate ride from which you can see most of the sky;ine of Singapore. Easy to move around in the cabin and take photos of interesting areas seen from the sky. It is safe and can be relaxing.,,,
,,Well Worth A Visit,4,,"Really easy access and turning speed. Excellent views across Singapore. We combined the Flyer with visiting the SkyDeck at the Bay Sands Hotel then the Flower and Rain Forest Domes in the Park - all very walk-able once you arrive in the area. Pods are air conditioned.

Just under the Flyer there are the pit garages for the Singapore Grand Prix - if nothing going on you can walk down the pit lane and stand on pole position - its a must if you're a fan.

On to the more mundane but perhaps more helpful - there are rest rooms on the way in and at the exit, in addition to, a small cafe area and souvenir shop. We took a taxi there from the Copthorne Waterfront near Clarke Quay around 10:30 in the morning and it only cost S$8.

As we say, well worth a visit.",,,
,,Way too expensive!,3,,"The price to ride this half-hour Ferris wheel is rediculous! I would say ""don't bother"", but my teenage daughter wanted to ride. They jam lots of people in each car and, although the view is lovely at the top, it is not worth it.",,,
,,Great way to get oriented,5,,These big ferris wheels can be a bit gimmicky but this one really offers a panoramic view. If this is your first time in Singapore you will be able to get a sense for the layout of the city. Takes 30 minutes round trip. No lines early in the day. Well air conditioned.,,,
,,best view of singapore,5,,you'll definitely have the best view of the city. worth my 33sgd. you won't even feel it moving. wait 'til you're at the very top. sunsets occur around 7pm or even later.,,,
,,Worth it,4,,"A good place to go but do check it 1st if there is rain, lightening, or wind then it is closed. So difficult to find a taxi some times. Hence check before you go.",,,
,,Best view,4,,"From the top of the SG flyer everything is visible and the view is amazing.You can see Marina Bay up close,some of the condominiums close by and even the domes",,,
,,Great Views,5,,"This was a great way to view Singapore over the Bay. Very relaxing, no waiting. Another must do. I can only imagine this would be fantastic at night",,,
,,1 breathtaking view is alls it is!,3,,"~parked many times right across the Singapore Flyer but not until now did I take my 40mins trip before

~this time on a touristy show & tell trip I went up and boy was I happy it ended

~I'm the first to wanna go up high places for the view and the brief experience or thrill outside sometimes but I'm just not as excited when it's back home (yeah we make lousy local tourists)

~service was adequate, ride was smooth, I'd hoped for more of an interactive or even one way commentary of the view during the ride

Everything else on the fringe of the experience was good overall!",,,
,,Breathtaking view,5,,"I did it in the morning and I really liked that. It was awesome. It moves so slowly that you don't feel it. You can see a beautiful view of Singapore,take great pics and enjoy.
The price is 33 SGD.
The nearest MRT station is 'Promenade' take exit A and walk there for 5 mins.",,,
,,The giant wheel for a great aerial view of Singapore,5,,"A must visit in Singapore. Get a great glimpse of Singapore while you relax leisurely is the comfortable glass capsule. The capsule takes one rotation in about 30 minutes, at a slow pace. The glass capsule can accommodate around 10 to 12 persons, spacious with seats and also enough space to walk around. One can take tons of great aerial photos of the city and spot some of the famous locations if you have a map of the city.
Must visit in Singapore!",,,
,,Most enjoyable experience,5,,"We really enjoyed the Singapore Flyer, great view, no waiting when we were there and it cost us nothing on the Singapore stopover package, having flown there with Singapore Airlines.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,2,,A huge circular structure turning so slowly that you don't feel it's moving. You can have a nice view of the Singapore skyline but do it only if you have time with nothing else to do!,,,
,,Excellent.,5,,"I thought this would be a rip off but was pleasant ly surprised about the good deal i got buying universal tickets and aquarium tickets together.
Great views and felt very safe.
Didnt like the fact they charge double price at night time. I think thats a rip off. I went day time",,,
,,Singapore 2016 travel,5,,One of the highlights of our travel. Very near the center of Singapore. It's an amazing place. I enjoyed it with my sister.,,,
,,A disappointing experience,2,,"We were excited to do this attraction as we had heard you get fantastic views of Singapore. Whilst this is true, we were a little disappointed with the experience. We had expected to have some information inside the pods themselves about what you are looking at, focal points etc but there was nothing. We thought perhaps there would have been an audio talk suggesting which side to look out of and what you could see but again nothing. Having not been to Singapore previously we thought this would be a good attraction to get a sense of where things are in relation to each other obviously not. We did see on exiting that there was some information points scattered around but we were confused as to why these would not be inside the pods?
Overall a disappointing experience and for the price you pay we did not think it was worth $66SPD for 2 adults.",,,
,,Dinner in the flyer,4,,We had dinner in the flyer it was fun and impressive. A unique experience that i would recommend. The food wasnt bad considering the difficulty of having everything done on time. I would only suggest to have the option of ordering drinks while on the ride ibstead of beforehand only.,,,
,,Must do photo shoot opportunity,5,,This was an excellent experience. Without doubt the best way to see downtown Singapore and much of the sea front area. The ride moves very slowly and panoramic views are afforded. All in all good value for money.,,,
,,Must go if you are are Singapore,5,,You can see the whole city.Amazing at night.All the light and city view you can view from there.Best time is to visit this place is at evening.,,,
,,Good but expensive,4,,"It's a little expensive for a 20mins ride. The view is brilliant from the top and the cubicle is really big. You can choose to enjoy the view on the bench in the cubicle, or you are free to walk around in the cubicle to take pictures.",,,
,,Awesome view,5,,"Great view of the island, must visit when u're in singapore. Palm sweaty high kinda thing, but it's safe 馃槀",,,
,,Go during sunset,4,,We had the 5 attraction pass and we're choosing between Marina Bay Sands skypark or the Flyer and chose the latter (actually the kids did!). We got there around 6pm but decided to walk around the riverfront until 7pm in order to catch the city at dusk. It's a 30 minute ride and definitely worth it if you can catch the city views both before and after dark.,,,
,,Great view from the top of this flyer,5,,"This is a must when you go to Singapore, it goes around slowly giving you ample time to take pictures of all of Singapore from the top. Even if your afraid of heights it is so gently that you barely feel the height",,,
,,Singapore Flier,5,,Akin to the London Eyes only the Singapore Flyer is larger. The carriage are tubular and offer great views of Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore skyline. It is definitely worth a visit.,,,
,,A Must Visit,5,,"Visited here at 11 in the morning and it was pretty deserted and thought we might have made a mistake.

Nothing could be further from the truth, thought it offered spectacular views of the city. It just appears that this has not caught on yet, apart from the views, will give you a good idea of the other things that you want to visit in the vicinity.

This does not 'Fly' or operate if it is raining heavily or there is a chance of lightning, so check the weather forecast before you schedule.",,,
,,Breathtaking view.,5,,Singapore flyer provides breathtaking view of city and should be in one's to do list in Singapore... Takes around 45 minutes for the complete ride..,,,
,,Great views over the area,5,,"Persuaded my wife to give the Flyer a go, it's a great experience. For those who haven't been, the wheel motion never stops even for getting on and off, although it is so relatively slow that it's no problem even for those with young kids.

As the car gets higher and higher the views just get better, superb views over the surrounding area, ships at anchor, the gardens and the city.

Well worth a go.",,,
,,Great Views. (Top 3 things to do in Singapore),5,,"If you are in Singapore, then a visit to the Singapore Flyer is a must. The ride last 30 mins and the entire gondola (as they are called) is quite big and can accommodate 15 people atleast. if you are scared of heights, then maybe avoid but I would still ask you to go and sit in the middle of the seating area where you wont feel the height.
The ride is expensive though (costs about 33 Singapore dollar per person) and the first 25% of the ride does not really have any interesting views except for the view of the ocean, part of the Singapore grand prix track and Gardens by the bay. It is only once Gardens by the Bay comes, that all the sights including, the Marina Bay, the Singapore Skyline, Merlion Park, Esplanade, Helix Bridge, Marina Bay etc. are viewed with a mind boggling views. Get yourself clicked as many times with these different views in the background.

The one complaint I had though was the entire approach to actually finding the flyer is not very well designed and there should be many signboards. Also, the gift shops needs to have small models of the flyer to take back home and the staff in the gift shop could be a little more courteous.

There is also the option of visiting it in the night and getting a different view of the same things with the lighting but due to the cost it might not justify going twice. Better to take a pic of the flyer from far when it is lit which itself is quite beautiful",,,
,,Greatest Ride On Earth,5,,"Ordered tix before trip for private Mo毛t Car. 45 minute night ride in which you get to see the light show in the Bay. Fabulous, simply fabulous!!",,,
,,Great view!,5,,"We went during the day but I would recommend going at dusk so that you can see Singapore during the day and at night. It takes about 45 minutes (if I remember correctly) to go all the way around which gives you ample time to chat, soak in the view and take lots of pictures.",,,
,,Good value for money and amazing views over the city,4,,"Very easy to find, we used the hop on hop off bus. No need to book in advance, just turn up, pay, have obligatory photo taken and enjoy. The wheel turns very slowly which gives you plenty of time to take photos and lasts for about half an hour. Once off, try the street food in the lower hall, fantastic value for money",,,
,,High in the sky,5,,Was sceptical about going on this as I don't really like heights. Was a fantastic view from bottom to top and back to the bottom again.,,,
,,Worth going,5,,If you want to explore Singapore by areal view. Choose Singapore flyer almost 165 meters high gives you so many opportunities to take nice photos of beautiful Singapore,,,
,,spectacular views,5,,"I recommend going midweek as the queues are far shorter than attempting this at the weekend. its a tad pricey at around $33 a person but, as a one off, it ticks your bucket list",,,
,,worth to visit,5,,"Superb attraction. Nice view to Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay, F1 race track and overall Singapore. Small botanic garden underneath.",,,
,,Fabulous view,5,,Went up just on dark. Couldn't believe how smooth the ride was and the views were awesome. Spectacular views of Marina Bay and Singapore. Takes around 30 minutes and well worth a visit .,,,
,,Best views of Singapore and very wheel chair friendly,5,,We recently enjoyed a ride on the Singapore Flyer for the second time. The views are fantastic and the staff are very caring for those in wheel chairs. My wife was a little disappointed that they no longer have the audio ears to give a running commentary on what's what but we still loved the experience. Great for families as well. Kids in our car were just enthralled by the views.,,,
,,Oustanding experience,4,,The views are exceptional. The views are a photographers dream and the memories you can make on just one ride will make you glad you did'nt miss the opportunity. We highly reccomend the Flyer.,,,
,,Nice,3,,"very high price and only 1 round, but the view was awesome. i was expecting 7-8 rounds but it was only 1 with a very very veryyyy beautiful view....",,,
,,nice view,5,,"when I was there there was raining so we enjoyed very nice view but other people could not see since due to security it stopped it operation so pl check before booking the tickets,you can buy from counter,no rush",,,
,,Good view of the city,4,,It lasts 30 minutes and gives you a great view of Singapore. You pods are huge and if you go on a quiet time of day you get one to yourself ....,,,
,,Perfect view,5,,"I was a little apprehensive about the flyer as I'm not a fan of Ferris Wheels, however it goes so slow I thought I could deal with it and I wanted to see the view from up there.
You could see for miles from up there and there was ample time to get good footage/photos.
It was a great ride, nothing negative to say about it",,,
,,"Fantastic views, comfortable, clean and quiet.",5,,"A worthwhile attraction, the views are amazing across Singapore. More than sufficient time to enjoy all views and take photographs or videos. The cabins that you travel in have good views all around and are also very clean.",,,
,,"Amazing view, must visit",5,,"It's a 25 minute slow spin in a giant wheel with views of the city. You cannot actually make out that it is moving. It is quite slow and allows for relaxed viewing. We went at night and enjoyed the aerial skyline views with lights.
Suggest to go after getting a little familiar with the city so that you can identify the different structures that you see.",,,
,,Outstanding views,4,,"Staff very interactive, this was money well spent I'd definitely go back for a night viewing next time",,,
,,Really overpriced,3,,Went there the second time. 33 S$ for adults for average experience is almost too much. Better you save the money for other things since it's not so spectacular.,,,
,,Loved it!,5,,Went early to avoid the cruise crowds and it paid off. 4 of us in the compartment. Excellent view of the city!,,,
,,Best view!,5,,Been to Singapore many times but this is the first time to give the flyer a try. Definitely worth it! When you're riding it make sure to choose the time before the sun sets. You will be amazed by the color of the sky. You can see almost everything on the top. Really great view.,,,
,,A must do while visiting Singapore,5,,"You must visit this attraction at least once while visiting Singapore. It's a little expensive but well worthwhile. Great views of the city, assuming it's a clear day. Go you will not be disappointed.",,,
,,Ride at 8pm to view light show at Super Tree Grove,5,,Excellent opportunity to view this beautiful city from high above. A must do for anyone visiting Singapore.,,,
,,Good way of seeing sights in 30 mins,4,,"We went during the day due to our time pressures, would suggest more benefit visiting at night time. Half hour is long enough.",,,
,,Interesting experience,4,,"We went on this one evening with small kids and the view was fantastic. This is one of a great way to see the city moving in slow motion.

Like in the premises of most other attractions in Singapore you could be pestered by photographers who snap your photograph with your family or significant other with or without your permission and try and palm it off to you as you exit .

As I walked down the corridor towards the exit I saw my face staring back at me with my family behind me .

I did not buy the picture and cared not what they did with my picture but I am sure there are many who would .

The experience in the flyer was interesting although expensive but it is a one time show and one can over look it.",,,
,,Amazing Experience. Must do!,5,,This gives you an amazing wide view of the city. It lasts about 30 mins and is totally worth the money. Must try activity when you are here.,,,
,,Awesome view of Singapore,5,,Must go place with kids to see a panoramic view across the country. Nice space and worth the time money and effort invested,,,
,,Top view of Singapore,5,,The flight of flyer takes half an hour to complete a round. This gives you told view of Marina Bay & surroundings. It's sharing flight so you Hve around 8-10 ppl in a flight with you. It's suggested to visit this in evening after sunset to get bright view of Marina sands in dark.,,,
,,Currently the largest World Wheel! 165m,5,,"Yes, The London Eye by Westminster is brilliant but at the very least your experience on that will be equalled by spending the ( excellent value) 33 Singapore Dollars per adult to spend a good hour on and around this 2014 commissioned Singapore ""must see"" attraction. Despite a thunderstorm day and dark skies we were afforded the best way to see Singapore's skyscrapers and surrounding parks, harbour, river, historic buildings such as St Andrews Church from above.

Children were absorbed by the interactive detail in various rooms you walk through and learn from, as you walk towards the pods.

The revolution of the wheel is slow and deliberate, we were just four adults in our pod when we were there so moving around freely within the pod all 360 degrees of vision was possible without other visitors to restrict our views, allow at least 90-120 minutes here to savour things

Everywhere is spotlessly clean and the staff are rightfully proud of this engineering marvel of Singapore's 21st century history.

First class!",,,
,,Great,5,,A great view on the bay and on the town. Very comfortable; big cabin air conditioned. The cabin moves very slowly and we have all the time to admire the landscape and take pictures. A very pleasant moment,,,
,,Spectacular views....worth the money,5,,"This is a must see when in Singapore. The 30 mins spent on the flyer are cooool........but so is the experience overall. And the views are spectacular. It is best to do this at twilight - approx 7 PM. This ensures you get some day time views of the Singapore skyline, but more importantly the spectacular views at night. Worth the money.........",,,
,,City view from different angles,4,,Gives a good view of the entire place. Good photo opportunities. Try to visit during sunset time in the evening as u can get both day and night views during the course of the rotation.,,,
,,Great Place to spend your weekends,4,,"Brought my grandmother there and she thoroughly enjoyed herself, bird's eye view of Singapore. Recommend to visit between 7-730pm.",,,
,,Best view of city,5,,"Very good views from flyer ,really one must visit this attraction , went for night view , was very nice",,,
,,Honeymoon,5,,"It was our honeymoon when we visited the singapore flyers. It was massive and when your up there its astonishing, specially in our case we went there at night time the singapore lights from up above there is breathless, a must visit place in SG. Furthermore a long que will not be an issue because they have this museum / arts display while you enter, you will surely be busy taking pix!",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,You can see most of Singapore Island the the surrounding ocean from the Flyer. It is a leisurely tour up high and allows a birdseye view difficult to imagine from ground level.,,,
,,Great,5,,Its like a round in the paradise it costs 33 SGD but deserves every cent u spend there very big recommended to try it,,,
,,Awesome,5,,I have no words to describe beauty of Singapore flyer..very beautiful place and night view of Singapore flyer is very hurt touching I love and enjoyed alot at this place...,,,
,,Singapore from the sky...,5,,"We booked champagne flight for singapore flyer and time chosen was around sunset, so we could witness the gorgeous singapore during both the time of the day. It's worth the money for romantic date as you can book the cabin for just two, but if you are hanging out with your friends then routine flight will serve the purpose. View was gorgeous, tranquillity at its best, to sum up I would say if you have only one day at your disposal then spend your time here with most organised and cordial staff it was breathtaking experience.",,,
,,Quiet cool,5,,"Really cool . Great views . Booked online which was easier as you don't have to queue up at ticket office ( not saying there was a big queue) no price difference if you do it online or there on the day.

The capsule was big clean and went nice and slowly .",,,
,,Stunning!,5,,"The views are just stunning! Its very hard to say when the views are best, during the day or the night! We visited during the night and were mesmerized by the views of Singapore! The city is so full of lights and of course a superb architecture! If you want to have the best views of the city (maybe excluding the marina sand bay club) Flyer is your best bet!",,,
,,a 360 view of Singapore,3,,"It is situated near the MRT station ""Promenade"" near the downtown, very easy to go there. It is long enough for you to have good views of the whole city as it lasts for about 20 minutes in each journey. Many of the attractions can be enjoyed, including the Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Sea, etc. It is not so crowded and no need to wait for long.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"Very similar to the London Eye this offers great views over the city and rotates at a very leisurely pace so you can really enjoy them. It overlooks part of the grand prix race track and it is amazing just how narrow the track is in places, the drivers are exceptionally skilled to drive these roads at such high speeds.",,,
,,Nice View of the City,4,,"Highly recommend this for a complete view of the city. Slow takes around 40 mins, so you get the best views from all angles.",,,
,,Superb views of Singapore,5,,A great 30 minutes viewing the expanse of Singapore with only eight people in the capsule there was plenty of room to move about and take photos.,,,
,,Lovely view,5,,The Singapore flier is one of the major attractions for the tourist who can have a lovely view from the flier. You can enjoy about 30 minutes of the ride.,,,
,,Great sights and a great experience!,4,,"On our recent trip to Singapore we took the kids all up on the Singapore Flyer. First, let me say that it is a great experience, and I would recommend that anyone heading to Singapore give it a try. The day we went up was a beautiful day and we could easily see both Indonesia and Malaysia. There are plenty of helpful guides in the Flyer cars as well as on the walk through just prior to entering the Flyer. My kids loved it, and it gave us a good 30-40minutes of time to rest in the AC! So, it was highly recommended.

The only thing that prevents me from giving this a 5 circle review is the cost. It is quite expensive to go on flyer, even for kids. My family of 6 was about USD120 for the 30 minute attraction. So, not a small amount. But, in general we did feel it was worth i!!",,,
,,Must do in Singapore,5,,"Immerse yourself to the beauty of a modern city/contry that is like no other. It's exciting yet safe. A ride for any age, even for seniors. Must do when in Singapore.",,,
,,Rainy Day Fun,5,,"It was not the best of days to see the views from the top, but we were glad we went up anyway. On a clear day you can really see the skyline and other fantastic structures in this city.",,,
,,Finally made it,5,,Finally rode the Singapore Flyer. There was a brief rain shower just as wee arrived and we stayed dry the whole time. The vie was spectacular the whole revolution. Loved it.,,,
,,An amazing experience,5,,What construction the wheel is. Some incredible engineering to have built such a large Ferris Wheel. The views over Singapore are well worth the costings of the 'flight' Will definately recommend this as a must do.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,3,,"It gets interesting during the ascend and at the peak. During the descend, may get a bit down-going.",,,
,,Another big Wheel,5,,Great views and great place to get a peak of this amazing city. As always clean with very nice staff.,,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,"My youngest son was very apprehensive about going on the Flyer and for the first half of the journey sat motionless on the seat in the middle of the capsule. Once he realised we weren't going to fall, he absolutely loved spotting different sites around Singapore.",,,
,,Spectacular views,5,,"I highly recommend visiting this atraction as You get a nice view of the whole city. The capsules are spacious (tbh there were only 4 of us but the capacity is more than 20 people) and the wheel rotates at low pace so you have plenty of time to enjoy the view.

You can get some knowledge about the flyer's history in the little museum which is located in the building and its entrance is involved in a ticket fee.",,,
,,beautiful.. just like the city..,5,,I have done many flyers but this one is the most beautiful. one gets to appreciate the beauty of Singapore from so high up.. Go on a clearer day as the flyer gets closed in the weather is stormy. and take the flight around 6pm when the city lights up.,,,
,,Fantastic view,5,,"I was lucky enough to have one of the pods all to myself, it was just awesome, you don't even know you are moving and on a clearer day the view is amazing, Another of Singapores must do things to see and do",,,
,,Absolutely loved it!,4,,"Such fantastic views of the city. We managed to go at sunset and since it takes a while to do a full loop, we had the entire sunset through to dark with city lights.",,,
,,See the City Skyline on the Singapore Flyer,3,,"Avoid hazy days for this experience. See the City skyline from the Singapore Flyer. I personally prefer the River Duck Tours to this, where you still get to see the City Skyline and it's more fun. This attraction is ok, but it certainly isn't the London Eye where you get to feast your eyes over a historic City.",,,
,,Peace @ height,4,,"Wonderful feeling of being in the air. Nice views of the Singapore skyline. Best time to ride it at about 6.30pm. You will get the advantage of daylight, plus the sunset, and the view at night. Been on the flyer 3 times and I still love it.",,,
,,up you go and the best to view,5,,"try it in both light and dark its the best place to visit after skypark ,have a and relax you will enjoy the views for sure ,beautiful views",,,
,,Must-do !!,5,,"A visit to Singapore is not a visit if you don,t go on the Singapore Flyer. Along with the towering buildings, the Singapore Flyer is also a special feature of the skyline. Even for the feint hearted it is special. The views over Singapore, beyond over the Malacca Straits, towards Marina Bay sands, Singapore River, the Marina gardens and more....just amazing. For what you get, ie. the views, excitement $33 Sing$ is very reasonable, the ride takes approx. 1 hr very slow, staff escorting onto ride are friendly...and most of all it is SAFE. The gondolas fit approx 10-12 persons and still leaves plenty of room to move around inside for those great photo opportunities. Love this attraction and will definitely do it again on our next visit.",,,
,,take it at night and see the whole singapore,4,,the location is very convenient. nice night view. well managed so not crazy long lines. quite a big stuff to do around the Flyer,,,
,,Gem of Singapore,5,,Its a gem of Singapore. Modern and very beautiful. Can see whole singapore. Very Exciting. You can have lunch or dinner in it,,,
,,London flyerisque,5,,Loved the 45min ride. Lights at night was a super site to see. Becomes a bit boring at times but something to not miss out on.,,,
,,Stunning View,5,,"We did the flyer at night and the city comes alive with magnificent views of Garden by the Bay, Marina Bay and the surrounding views - pods were air conditioned and very spacious ! Should be on your ""to do list"" when visiting Singapore - loved it !
Anne G",,,
,,Simply Breathtaking..,5,,We loved the Singapore Flyer so much we visited during the day & night. Air conditioned comfort & views to inspire!!!. Worth every cent. Would highly recommend it.,,,
,,Night visit,5,,Beautiful views and spectacular lights if you go on an evening ride. The cost was $33 Sg. per adult There were about 8 in our capsule so we were free to walk around and take pics,,,
,,great way to see entire singapore,5,,"singapore, obviously is humid.. so after walking around needing to sit but still wanting to see the city, this flyer will provide all of that! a/c, view and a seat =) my time here was limited so while we were making sure our time wasnt wasted i also wanted a view.",,,
,,Not great and not bad as well,3,,"Gives you the full view of the singapore 馃嚫馃嚞 and the sea 馃寠, the overall ride takes 20 min. You can get some good pics. Recommend for couples.",,,
,,More for Photo enthusiasts,3,,"For a family of 3 there was an offer for 78 dollars so we picked it up. It just moves slowly and gives a good view of the high rises and the city. I did not find it as amusing but one time try.

You also have options to be served with a Beer in a private cube and charges are higher for those.

Overall an average experience",,,
,,Not to be missed. L,4,,"We really enjoyed our trip on the Singapore Flyer. Very well organised with friendly helpful staff. The views are awesome,however there is no real sensation of moving. The price was reasonable considering the time to compete the circle. A must do when in Singapore.
Peter B.",,,
,,stunning view of singapore,5,,"Location quite far from the city. If you take MRT, you must continue to walk around 10-15 minutes to the flyer. And after you've arrived to the location, you have to walk quite far to the flyer entrance. Pretty exhausting for older people.",,,
,,The Singapore Flyer,5,,This is the second time we have been on the Singapore Flyer and saw quite a lot more than last time.,,,
,,Nice for the view,3,,Take this ride for the view as other than that it's nothing special. Seems safe enough although for Singapore it was surprisingly dirty with trash on the grounds.,,,
,,Awesome,4,,From here will get whole view of Singapore. Worth for money. highly prefer to have this ride in evening.,,,
,,What a view,4,,"It's difficult to describe this fantastic experience. The views are exceptional, the ride comfortable. There were only 2 couples in the pod and we were able to take pics all around. Even of each other.",,,
,,"Singapore ""London eye""",4,,It gives bird view of whole Singapore not much crowded around 35 minutes. Nice place to go and a get a feel of singapore.,,,
,,Stunning views,5,,"Well worth going on, we did it in the evening and the views were stunning as well as the fantastic light show.",,,
,,Better than most.,5,,So for adults March 2017 the price is SGD33 which some find expensive but if you think of the investment in this structure and the great views you get of Singapore it's well worth it. Value for money it was much better than the London Eye.,,,
,,Worth the hype,5,,"Grand views of the city-scape and Singapore skyline. Try to catch it during sunset to enjoy daylight as well as night views. They offer exclusive packages - like dinner for two or group bookings. Visit their website to know more.
If you are visiting one altitude or Marina Bay Sands Skypark, you can actually skip this.",,,
,,Incredible View,5,,"It located a lil bit far away from MRT Station, but after you get in ther, you're gonna get an amazing view from inside the capsules. And the best time to enjoy the ride is in the afternoon, enjoying the sunset. Absolutely nice place and gonna be my favorite place if i go to Singapore.",,,
,,Must visit in Singapore!,4,,Great Panoramic views of the city skyline and the garden by the bay. Very spacious and comfortable cabins for viewing.,,,
,,highest observation wheel in Asia,4,,"The flyer is located in a spot where the views of the downtown towers, the Marina and the ocean can all be seen at the same time. Not much of a line.",,,
,,Great views from the top,5,,"We visited at the beginning of march on a clear bright sunny morning, the views from the top were fantastic looking over the city.",,,
,,romantic view,5,,"i spent my honeymoon in singapore, before was dissapointed of searching romantic place. but then after we find singapore flyer, we decided to buy ticket and enjoy very amazing view. anyway i can't describe how beautiful, but you have to try at least once!!",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"The views from the top are spectacular, you are sat in a pod and it goes really slow so you don't miss any view from every side. Would highly recommend when you visit Singapore.",,,
,,Stunning views at night time,4,,We went late in the evening and encountered almost no queue. I don't think I would like to stand in a long queue in the humidity. The queuing system is very long and appears it could take quite a while. At night Singapore comes alive. The cars are well appointed and well air conditioned. Motion is so slight you forget you are moving. There are adequate seats for most to sit down. Bring your camera!,,,
,,Great view!,5,,"This was a fun way to see the city. The flyer moves slow, so there was no chance of anyone getting sick. Also, it has air conditioning in each car. The kids loved it!",,,
,,Night Flight,5,,Did a night flight this time around (did a day flight last time) and it's a great experience. Good to see the Supertree Lightshow from a different perspective.,,,
,,Fun and great views.,5,,"Tickets were $33 Singapore, ride is about 1/2 hour long. We got lucky and there was no line. Cars hold about 20 people, we were total of 9 in the car, so it wasn't crowded. It's 165 meters high.",,,
,,The flyer,4,,I would recommend the FLYER just to say you did it . I found it a little boring you can get better views from Mariner bay hotel or even you own hotel,,,
,,Nice relaxing stop,5,,"Singapore is rather small, but there are a few things to see and do. The Singapore Flyer is one of them. I was in Singapore for a brief stop and took the Flyer, views of the city are pleasant. Also, you meet people from all over the world while visiting Singapore.",,,
,,Good attraction but owner should review its price,4,,"Should there be no MBS skypark, this is worth the price, however when there is competition in the SIMILAR prospective, this company should review the price.to attract more tourists,
They should make it more affordable especially it an old attraction.
Although it much different product from MBS skypark, it gave almost the same view that one is seeking.
However , for first timer, one should never miss out.
Afterall, it one of the highest and biggest in the world and it rotates very slowly , you probably will not worry about height when you are into the capsule.
Lastly, if you are into a romantic dinner whereby you want to have with your loved one, you should consider this first attraction

Cheers !",,,
,,First time behaved like a tourist and loved it.,5,,"i am usually in and out of Singapore for business, this was the first time had some time spare and behaved like a tourist. simply loved the view of the city from the height and loved each minute of the approx 40 minutes spent there.",,,
,,Romantic dinner with a view,5,,We decided to celebrate our anniversary with a romantic dinner atop the SG Flyer. It was an amazing experience with a view that you cannot beat.,,,
,,Nice experience,5,,Takes about 30min to go around. Very smooth ride and great view. Especially fun during a thunderstorm :-),,,
,,Great view of the city vibe!!!,4,,"Singapore flyer gives a great view of the beautiful city and gives an opportunity for taking some amazing pics from the top of the eye. Keep your mobile flash on though as offcourse the best view is in in the night once the city glitters with lights. Perfect place for a dinner date if someone wants to sweep the girl , but offcourse getting vegetarian food may be a challenge on the flyer, didn't explore that.

An alternative for the view is the Marina bay sands hotel roof top - both come with a cost offcourse. Recommend you do one of them once, I prefer the marina bay one as it will give you an open view rather than being in the packed flyer .",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,We went here at night hardly any queues cabins are quite large and moves very slow. Excellent views of Singapore.Anyone afraid of heights should not be worried you feel completely safe.,,,
,,Enjoyable but Expensive,4,,"The views from the Singapore Flyer are fantastic. The cars are very comfortable and cool. You move very slowly so you can really take it all in. We know Singapore well but it would make the flight more enjoyable to have a map inside the cars so you could identify the landmarks. I would prefer that to an audio soundtrack which can be intrusive. We shared our car with a super Australian family and had fun picking out the Formula 1 track in detail with them as keen F1 fans but that was because we knew it was there. You could easily miss it. We thought the connectivity was not up to the usual Singapore standard. It is a long walk from Promenade MRT and it is not particularly well signposted so that you can find a safe pedestrian route easily. Buses are also a long walk away. Something to bear in mind if you have small children with you. Also, even though we went mid morning on a weekday we waited quite some time in a queue. Tickets were expensive we thought. Overpriced for a half hour or so entertainment.",,,
,,Highlight on a visit to Singapore ( must see),4,,"This was our second visit (first time was in December 2015, evening) during the daytime, both times the views are great, with the night views being special because all the building in the business district are all lit. During the day time the view is good to get an idea of the tourist attraction in the surrounding area.
This is place has boarding pass privileges if you travel Singapore air lines (they said this was not valid on public holidays did not see any comment about this on their web site though). If it is your first time to the location and will be visiting the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay and other tourist attractions around the wheel a day time visit would be best as you will be able to get an idea of the other location in relation to the Singapore flyer.

Also there is hawker center at the base of the flyer, we wanted to have a meal there but the place did not look very clean.

This is definitely a highlight on a visit to Singapore. The closes MRT is Promenade.

Travelled on 25 December 2016.",,,
,,Awesome place but a bit expensive,5,,"Singapore flyer is a good place and one of its kind experience. Good view and clean boxes. However, i felt its a bit expensive. not really value for money.",,,
,,Should have had audio,3,,"Great view of the city, but without an audio guide we did not know what we were looking at. Best to go as the sun sets. City lights are great!",,,
,,Must Watch location in your visit,5,,This will provide a 360' view of the Bay & the City. we went there in a day time. But it is advisable to visit there in the evening or night time. But if you are using the Metro line you need to walk over 2 Kms to reach there from Promenade MRT line.,,,
,,Amazing view!,5,,"The roundtrip is about 30 minutes, like it's said by the owners. We've been their in the morning on sunday and bought the tickets by their Website before . Luckily there weren't so many people. In the capsule we had a lot of space to have a view from every side. The price for the trip is good and we had a little photoshooting before we went inside, you can buy the photoshopped pictures with nice Backgrounds after. If not, will be also ok. Would always recommend the flyer.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,"It is the best ride ever since it is taller then London eye ,very smooth ride and you can have view of full Singapore from all the side person having motion sickness can also have ride comfortably and can enjoy",,,
,,If you have Time to kill,3,,"Leisure walking distance from Lau Pa Sat. Very near the Marina complex. My friends already bought tickets for us and we were just about to get in when it dawned on me (had a full day and wasn't paying attention) that this wheel isn't like the usual ferris wheels where you all take turns getting in, get a faster whirlybit, and then grind to a stop getting off. This wheel doesn't stop. It just keeps on moving at snail-pace so you can simply get on and off when the carriage is at the entry level. All between that, you're supposed to enjoy the sights in seated (or standing- yes you can walk around inside if not too crowded) airconditioned comfort - for more than 30 mins. Since our hotel already gave us higher and very good views, I easily convinced our group to use the good money to get beer along the Marina instead. (Good thing there was an obliging group after us.) I'd still recommend the experience for others who wish to enjoy company with a great view.",,,
,,A must do,5,,This is a must do when in Singapore. It gives a great overview of the city & the bay. It's quite slow so you don't miss anything. And the cabins are very comfortable.,,,
,,Excellent,5,,Excellent views of the city and surrounding areas. Great place to capture panaromic photos of the Singapore skylines. Visited early evening and there were no queues to get on.,,,
,,Excellent!!!!,5,,"There are lots of options available to book this attraction. One can either book the normal flight or the cocktail or champagne flight which is the VIP option. The advantage of booking the VIP option is that you don't have to stand in queue and they have a seperate lounge for VIP ticket booking.
We tried the champagne flight option which was worth it. If you are lucky, you might even get the entire capsule to yourself. In the champagne flight option, they served us with one glass of champagne for each person along with chocolates and strawberries. Try booking a flight close to sunset so that you can see the day view as well as the night view. It is a 30 min ride. Gives you amazing views from the top. One should give it a try if you are visiting Singapore!!!!",,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,This was the first time l did this activity. Amazing experience. Lots of activities to participate. You need a whole day for this.,,,
,,the views from here....,5,,"Great experience with panoramic views from this enormous wheel. Good to get aboard late afternoon /early evening as see contrasting vistas in daylight, dusk and darkness.",,,
,,High flyer,5,,Great experience and wonderful views. Plenty of time and opportunities for photos and well worth the money.,,,
,,Great views no fuss,4,,"Lets start with, 'I don't like heights'. Don't let this bother you, we haven't done this before as I was concerned that I may 'freak out' but let me reassure anyone who is particularly uncomfortable with heights, there is nothing to worry about. The cabins are large and spacious, the size make you less conscious about the heights and if you focus on looking around you really appreciate what the Flyer has to offer.
The views in each direction are really amazing, views to the City, harbour, esplanade and gardens. The circuit takes about half an hour which goes quickly.
Enjoy looking around the area and the displays. Worth the experience however we went just before dusk so missed the lights.",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,4,,Last visit was during the day...this time we tried night. We were treated to the spectacular light show on Marina Bay. It was a relatively quiet night in terms of crowds. Not sure why the operators insist on filling each pod. We tried to have one for just four people as there was no one in a queue and we were happy to wait. Instead we shared a pod with smelly tourists who clearly had not bathed for a few days and a screaming baby. There is no way of escaping those things in the 30+ minute circuit of the flyer.,,,
,,bird view of the marina,5,,"though we were sceptical about the flyer, once in, it gets magical! it is going really slow (about 40 minutes for one rev), so we had plenty of time to enjoyr all the sides for the view. We could even see some peaks of indonesia, and all the ships at anchorage.
Even at the top, some buildings from the Marina still are higher than you, and that is kind of impressive!
Choose your timing right: don't go in when it is about to rain (about eeryday in the afternoon), or you won't enjoy the full range of the view!",,,
,,An amazing journey.,4,,Had been here with friends on package tour. It was an amazing journey to the flyer. We can see whole Singapore city when it reaches the top. It moves slowly and we had good time capturing photos and videos of the city.,,,
,,Flyer,5,,Great view of Singapore with different experience for day and night. Waiting time is within expectation.,,,
,,Views of singapore,4,,The flyer gives you a wonderful view of Singapore we were very lucky and had a local in our pod who was explaining things to see as we went around which we found very helpful and interesting,,,
,,Nice view of Singapore city.,4,,"Best time to take the flyer is day time when you can see the whole city clearly. Night time its beautiful, but you can see more of lights rather than the city. Morning 9 am to 12 noon would be ideal time. If you are a group of 10 people, reserve the cabin with lunch and they serve you nice lunch in the private cabin on the flyer.",,,
,,awesome experience,4,,Must to do thing in singapore. It was indeed a exhilarating experience for us. Go there in the evening and enjoy the beauty of singapore.,,,
,,Great view,5,,Great view over Singapore and Bay Area. Pick the time time to avoid the queues we went at 9:30pm didn't have to line up at all straight on 馃榾,,,
,,Singapore holiday,4,,"We enjoyed our visit to the Singapore Flyer, it was air conditioned and very comfortable. We had a great view of the city. We would highly recommend this activity.",,,
,,a good experience,4,,the view is amazing from flyer time your visit at night when lights are on.it is just half hour ride one circle only.but quite expensive at 33 dollars per person.u can see whole singapore from it.,,,
,,Incredible views,5,,Did not have to wait to get on no queue at all. Loved it went for about 30 minutes incredible views we all loved it,,,
,,Wonderful views,5,,The flyer is higher than the London Eye at 165 metres above the sea and is Asia's highest Observation Wheel. This trip costs $33 Singapore Dollars. The flyer does the full circle in about 30-40 minutes. The views are simply amazing especially from the top.,,,
,,High flyer,4,,"This is a rather expensive attraction, but gives a (literal) overview of the city. It was nice to sit in an AC gondola and see the city at our feet.",,,
,,FLY HIGH,5,,Wonderful way to see Singapore from up high. Takes 30 minutes to get round so you have plenty of time for some great photos. loved it. Checkout the KOI pond at the bottom - you can buy $1 worth of fish food and feed them from the bridge.,,,
,,A Must!!,5,,"The view is amazingly incredible. My capsule only had 4 people though they can hold 12 persons. It is very sturdy you don't even notice the motion or its climb. The capsule is entirely glass except the floor so you are able to take in the view in its entirety. I went during the day, the night view no doubt will be just as amazing. Highly recommend",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,Rolling in the Singapore Flyer was quite an experience it provided a wonderful picture of Singapore.,,,
,,A Must Visit!,5,,The Singapore Flyer takes only an hour to visit when in Singapore. You can see a 360 degree angular view of Singapore from the top. I would recommend this place to all travelers.,,,
,,Amazing views,4,,The views were amazing from the top and we didn't have to wait for more than 2-3 minutes in a line. It was pretty expensive in the end but I would recommend it.,,,
,,High above Singapore,5,,It was a very smooth ride on the Singapore Flyer with amazing views of Singapore fro above...we went during the day with very clear weather but the night time would be spectacular. Taxi fare from our hotel was vey reasonable as it was too hot to walk. It took about 30 minutes for the ride and the gondular was not full. You can even have dinner in one at night prebooked! The cost was very reasonable for the experience.,,,
,,A little Jewel in SG,5,,"Great fun with great views at the Singapore Flyer, especially if you are lucky enough to have the whole capsule to your own group. We had a memorable 45 mins ride. Highly recommend for first time visitors to Singapore.",,,
,,Just as you might expect!,4,,"Hard to say much about this as it is very much what you expect when you see the structure.
It moves very slowly so easy to get on and off. Not busy for our visit so plenty of room to walk around and take photos in different directions.
Seems expensive but must be costly to run. Overall feels like a pleasant experience as opposed to an adventure.",,,
,,Typical 'big wheel',4,,"This is supposedly the biggest in the world, but I would say about the same size as the London eye. Great views over the Barbour and marina bay, definitely worth a visit",,,
,,So/so,4,,"If I have to be honest, it is beautiful, but nothing really special. We waited for 2 hours in line. We were inside the cabin with 12 other people for 30 min. Yes, we saw the sunset and the light show, but no, it is not the best attraction in Singapore. And it was rather expensive.",,,
,,Best part is that you can have a 360 Degree view of Marinay Bay Area,3,,"Its one of the popular attractions in Singapore, where the flow of visitors never stops. However, I feel it's quite OK when it comes to the entertaintment value of it. Refer my ratings (On a scale of 10) below, for better understanding.
- Location : 7/10 (Need to walk a bit { 10-15 min} to reach to the location, be it from the Circle Line MRT Station or the Marina Bay centre)
- Price/Cost : 8/10 (Not too costly compared to Univeral Studios or attractions in Sentosa)
- Entertainment quotient : 6/10 (Nothing much to do or experience except as I mentioned earlier, the 360 Degree view at a very slow pace)
- Staff & Management of rides : 10/10
- Overall value for money : 6.5/10",,,
,,The best one,5,,It is big confortable and the view it is no words not pictue or video can make any justice what you can see amazing the ride it is very smude and good for any age,,,
,,Wonderful way to see Singapore,5,,Definitely worth going on this which is larger than the London Eye. Views were amazing. Would have been useful to have map within the pod so that places could be identified,,,
,,Whole lot of fun and educational,4,,One of the best things about this attraction is that it's not very busy. Once you reach it won't be long before you actually ride the wheel. Before that you go through a display to show how it was built etc which was really interesting. Views were amazing. Many other small attractions near by and at the base to stay busy. Eateries available at and near the entrance and close by.,,,
,,Amazing views across Singapore from the flyer,5,,"Fantastic views from the flyer, went at night and spectacular seeing the lights in the bay and across the city.",,,
,,Good relaxing time pass!,4,,Good place to relax with family & friends. Please take your binoculars and camera for nice views of the Singapore & surrounding area.,,,
,,"Logistically 2*, views 3*, amazing factor 2*",2,,"So u go there, park, walk walk to all until you eventually end up going up a wheel which is shorter than most buildings around.

So not great wow factor. Don't not get me wrong the views are amazing, it going up any bar or restaurant in the CBD would get u similar views. But then there is nothing else to do, but to drive elsewhere. So better off being in Raffles or MBSs get a good glance of the Citi and do something else without needing to drive elsewhere.",,,
,,Ride in the sky,5,,Well worth the ride. We went at a time when we got light and dark. Singapore is great under the lights. Do it,,,
,,Very nice,4,,The flyer is really nice.please go at Night. Breath taking views. Did this on my birthday. Absolutely loved it. Near suntec mall. A lot of taxi cab at the entrance to take you to your next sight.,,,
,,Wonderful View,5,,Fantastic view of city. Slow ascent and descent. Lots of time to take photos. Well worth cost. Recommend.,,,
,,Too expensive - average views,2,,"Ofcourse it's nice to go up in a ferris wheel and see the city light by night. But there are so many bars and hotels around the bay area that give you a similar view, plus they have the entertainment. Given the hefty entrance fee, it's not something I'd personally repeat.",,,
,,Good experience,5,,We enjoyed the Panoramic view and the sunset... it wasn't crowded at all just 6 people in the huge cabin ... getting the ticket was very easy too:),,,
,,Lovely view ...,5,,It was indeed a nice experience. Even better to visit at night to experience the dazzling view of Singapore! Enjoyed the 360 view of Singapore City from the flyer.,,,
,,Such a wonderful ride to see so much of Singapore and all the architecture.,5,,Had a great time on the Singapore Flyer. Saw it on the Amazing race show and thought it would be a great place to see. It was worth the effort walking there,,,
,,Great Views of Singapore.,4,,like the London Eye you enter a pod and it takes approximately 30mins to complete one revolution but you have wonderful views over the Bay area of Singapore. Quite expensive but worth it for the views.,,,
,,Singapore sling flight,5,,"We paid for a Singapore sling flight which gave us priority boarding, Singapore slings and a bowl of nuts.....and the cabin to our two selves. So loved it. It took 30 mins to complete our flight with amazing views. It was so smooth you couldn't even feel the Flyer move. I spent so much time taking pictures and looking out the windows, I nearly forgot to drink my sling!",,,
,,Nice Experience!,4,,Enjoyed the 360 view of Singapore City from the flyer. It was indeed a nice experience but missed great view due to cloudy weather. Better to visit at night to experience the dazzling view of Singapore!,,,
,,Beautiful Experience,5,,"Having checked out London eye few years ago, I knew what was in store when I took the flyer. Though not mesmerising, the panoramic city view was indeed great. We took the flyer at twilight and were able to see the city at both in natural light as well as illuminated lights.",,,
,,One of the Biggest flyer in the world,5,,"speechless, its just awesome. nice view from the top. worth it with the price :p. just come there and enjoy the view. thats it",,,
,,"Round and Round, she never stops",5,,"Great fun, fantastic views of the city. Don't not call her a Ferris wheel. She is The Singapore Flyer. You will love the new persp Clive of the city.",,,
,,"Good, but not great",3,,"We enjoyed the view, but the tinted windows make all your pictures dark and they have a green tinge.",,,
,,Great city views,4,,We were pleasantly surprised to almost walk right on the Flyer the first day we were in town. We went on a Sunday morning around 10:30 AM.,,,
,,Breath taking,5,,This is an engineering marvel. The capsules are so large and spacious. The view of Spore from different levels is awesome. A must visit attraction.,,,
,,Great view,4,,We did a family round at night. Amazing view by night. A must to see Singapore by night. Easy to pay and go in,,,
,,Great bird's eye view of Singapore,5,,"I had gone here with my wife, infant daughter and parents (senior citizens). The access to the flyer by taxi is very convenient. By MRT you will have to walk about 5-10 min from the nearest station.
The backside of the arena has a nice view of Marina Bay Sands and other Singapore attractions. Might be a good idea to reach here during daylight for some photo ops.
You've go through security check before entering, and in case of babies, you need to park the stroller outside. There's about 200-300 m walk after parking the stroller. So be prepared to carry your baby in arms that distance. Each capsule is quite spacious and they allow up to 8 people in a single capsule. There are benches to sit inside the capsule. Apart from the benches, every capsule has a lot of space to walk around. The capsule is air conditioned and has transparent glass on all the sides that offers a nice unhindered view. It was safe enough that we could let our daughter walk freely inside the capsule. My mother who has fear of heights and gets motion sickness sometimes, was absolutely fine throughout the ride. It is that safe and the whole thing rotates very slowly to not cause dizziness or nausea.
One rotation was about 40 min and we got fantastic views of downtown. Of course it helped that the weather was clear when we had gone. The more interesting views (according to me), are those of the downtown. You get to see these views only after half the rotation is complete (because the first half, you'll be facing the opposite side of downtown). Actually this can be ideal time to practice some photo shots with your DSLR and get the settings right. Going at night offers magnificent views of the city. After the journey, you can easily grab a taxi back home. There are multiple restaurants in the arena offering various cuisines. There's also an Indian buffet restaurant, albeit, a bit on the costly side.
Overall definitely recommended.",,,
,,See Singapore in 360 Degree,5,,"Super BIG ferris wheel!!
Great views.. I can see most part of Singapore. The ride was smooth, safe, and no shaky movement, so no reason to be scared of heights.. When I was there, the sky was cloudy... but I can still see half of Singapore main island...
The ride took around 30 minutes for one rotation.
I'm thinking of booking a dinner there next time. It must be more fun!!!",,,
,,The high flyer,4,,"This is the highest wheel in the world and it takes 30 minutes for a round trip. It is in a strange location, with not much else around it making it feel a bit forgotten or neglected. They don't tend to overcrowd the capsules (there was only 6 people in ours) but that might be because there weren't a lot of tourists there - it is certainly nothing like the busyness of the London Eye. It does offer an amazing view over Singapore and if you go close to sunset you can get some great photos of the sun setting behind the buildings.",,,
,,Great views,4,,So peaceful up here. Views are well worth the trip. Our trip was only spoilt by very noisy people who shared our carriage.,,,
,,Nice view,4,,A must visit location on Singapore trip.....The view from the flyer is good..... It takes approx. 30 minutes for one rotation.... and you can get different views of the city during the 30 min rotation of the flyer.,,,
,,View from the Top,5,,"A perfect way to get a great view of the city. Similar to the London Eye , the Singapore Flyer ensures you get a one of A kind experience from the comfort of the air conditioned capsule. Perfect way to spend a balmy afternoon.
P.S There may be some offers of discounts if you are using the Hop on Hop off Tours. Please check at the hotel.",,,
,,Singapore signature attraction,5,,"I recommend arriving around 630pm, in line at 645 and then enjoy daytime, sunset, dusk and nighttime views. Bring your singapore airlines boarding pass for a discount. It's too expensive. It can be long queue but a great chance to view Singapore marina and skyline. Living in Singapore 3 years but still take out of town visitors, still enjoying myself.",,,
,,Wow...! Great views...,5,,"I strongly recommend this to anyone / age on a clear day. This is one of the few places in Singapore where you can feel what calmness is like. Surprisingly, there are NO reminders / announcements from the speaker advising people of do's and dont's...",,,
,,"Overpriced, but worth it!",5,,"I'm a cheap guy, but this was worth it. The views are nice and it's totally worth the high price. Tip: Time it for sunset then walk over the Gardens By The Bay for the evening light show.",,,
,,Supa view,5,,This amazing piece of art in Singapore takes 30 mins for one complete rotation giving people a fantabulous view and enough time to enjoy it,,,
,,Beautiful view!,4,,"Lovely to see Singapore from this highth! Just make sure you visit the Flyer on a bright day, else you won't be able to see a lot.",,,
,,worth going,4,,great views obviously. got us nicely oriented to singapore when we visited. a relaxing activity. probably the first thing to do in singapore.,,,
,,Nice view of downtown singapore,5,,"It is quite pricey especially for low budget traveller (S$33 ticket), but it is worth the view. It offers magnificent view of downtown Singapore, especially at night.",,,
,,Amazing 100% worth trying it.!!,5,,We visited during our honeymoon in feb'12. We have taken usa -vegas and orlando flyer . But the singapore flyer can beat the views for both of them. This provides the best flyer views we have seen ever .,,,
,,Must to see in Singapore,5,,It is worth to visit and take a ride on it at least. Amazing view and good location to see the city. I really recommend it.,,,
,,Get a good view of the city.,5,,Good view of the city. No queue when I visited (end of Feb). Takes about an hour start to finish. Make sure you have plenty of battery left because you will probably take lots of photos.,,,
,,must go while in Singapore,5,,this is one of icon of Singapore really a great place and the view from the flayer is awesome can see all the important point of Singapore take around 30 minute to make around but its really worth it,,,
,,Worth the money,5,,"A great way to see Singapore. The flyer is surrounded by some of Singapore's most iconic tourist sites, all visible from the flyer. I'm terrified of heights but found the views captivating.",,,
,,Cool perspective of the city!,4,,"Did the flyer during night time, which in my opinion is much cooler than during the day...the trip took around 30 minutes and was expensive and if you are staying at the marina bay sands you may not feel very impressed, nonetheless it was a nice ride!",,,
,,Nice view,3,,Great way to see Singapore. Nice view but a bit of so what. Glad there was not a long line to wait for this.,,,
,,Mr Elias Reuben,4,,It's a beauty at night you can see some island of Indonesia but the price is high Quality remains the price soon forgotten Elias,,,
,,"The Singapore Flyer, a 42-story-high observation wheel in Singapore",5,,"The view of Singapore Flyer from Garden by the Bay. Reaching height of 165 metre s , gives visitors a spectacular perspective of the Singapore city . Several other complementary attractions at level 2",,,
,,Great Views!,5,,"Really enjoyed this. The experience lasts for about 30 minutes with extensive views of Singapore. Amazing to see the hundreds of ships lined up the Straits, the busiest seaport in the world. Highly recommended.",,,
,,The Flyer,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is similar to the Eye of London. The views from the Flyer are unbelievable. The city background, the port, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, and more. A must do!",,,
,,Bigger than the London Eye with great views.,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is the perfect place to photograph Singapore. For one 31 minute rotation in a pod that holds around a dozen people, you can see the whole city and it costs around $23 U.S. If you really want to splurge, they offer fine dining in one of the pods for around $220 per couple. As much as I enjoyed the London Eye, the Flyer is even better.",,,
,,Was good views but a small let down,3,,Having stayed in the Sands Marina Bay was a small letdown- would suggest visit to the pool in Marina. Ride also slow and if like that sort of thing is interesting. Does have night dinners- think about if you like that sort of thing.,,,
,,Good A/C on the cabins. Magnificent view.,5,,"May take a little while to get into the cabins as the wheel must be balanced and personnel may let empty cabins in between, making waiting time a little longer.",,,
,,Great Night View,4,,"My friends and I made a last minute decision to go to the Singapore Flyer after a whole day at Universal Studios on a Sunday evening. By the time we got there I think it was quite late (9:45-10pm?). There was no line to purchase tickets and no wait to go through security and walk through the exhibition to boarding. There weren't many people around at all and we were lucky enough to have a whole car to ourselves! The whole ride around the ferris wheel took about 30 mins so you can really enjoy the view on all sides.
Only down side is that the flashing lights on the ferris wheel outside the car reflect onto the surface of the glass so its hard to get nice photos on a phone or a point and shoot camera.
I highly recommend going when its quiet so you don't have to fight with a crowd in the car to get all the views.",,,
,,Overall view,3,,"Excellent attraction, well organised as one would expect in Singapore. Slick operation, interesting preamble displays. Superb views over the city",,,
,,A Must-Visit Attraction in Singapore,5,,"Essentially, the Singapore Flyer is a big Ferris wheel. Takes approximately one-half hour to complete one full circle. Given its height and location, the Flyer offers an impressive view of Singapore. I suggest an early sunset visit. Going on the Flyer at night, although pretty, I am not sure what you will see of the view itself. The cost is reasonable, considering that this is a Tourist Attraction, but I personally did not want come back home and say that I did not go on the Singapore Flyer. Since the highlight of the attraction is riding on the Flyer itself, we bypassed the museum type displays that were situated between the entrance and the ride itself.
Again, this is a must do in Singapore.",,,
,,I need to go again at night,5,,"It is a must see attraction in Singapore. You can see the bay, the F1 track, the gardens and you get a nice view of the city. I am pretty sure the view at night must be impressive.",,,
,,Great View,5,,"This slow motion ferris wheel gives great views of the city. It was so slow, we thought it was not working. Good ride, but for the view, not for the exciting ride.",,,
,,Giant wheel,5,,It feels so good to be in this such huge giant wheel but they are keeping it very safe and ac is also there,,,
,,Fantastic views,4,,Great views and a nice way to relax after a hectic day of sightseeing. I would recommend riding the flyer just prior to sunset.,,,
,,Excellent view of Singapore,5,,The Singapore flyer takes about 28-38 minutes and would give you excellent view of Singapore and diminished view of its neighboring countries. The flyer rotates slowly and steadily and one can take advantage of it to take pictures.,,,
,,Pretty cool,4,,Well it is a big Ferris wheel. Takes 35 minutes to go around and the views are pretty impressive. You can really place all the various locations which you have on the maps.,,,
,,Beautiful View at Night,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is just like the London Eye. We went in the evening around 9 pm and even at that time the waits are substantial to board the cars. It took us about 20 minutes from the time they took our ticket until we actually got on into the car. The ride is slow and the view is beautiful. We were able to see the light show at the Marina Sands Hotel which we had just seen at ground level the same night at 8 pm. Because of the reflections on the glass, we didn't get very good photos, and I'm not sure that the view is better or different than what one could see from the top of the Marina Sands Hotel. I would either view the city from the hotel or the Flyer, but I wouldn't recommend doing both. The entire ride takes about 40 minutes.",,,
,,Great... A Must do,5,,We did a sunset ride and it was excellent. the sights we great and we got our bearings on where everything was from this attraction. Money well spent.,,,
,,Must go,4,,"If you are into city view then do during the day time, on a clear day you can even see indonesia. If you are into nightlights of the city then night time will be the best. There are also various restaurant in the compound, eg. fast food, fine cuisine, local cuisine.",,,
,,Great view,5,,"Let me start by saying I am not great with heights, I entered the cabin and sat down and didn't move for the whole trip however I really enjoyed it. I found the cabin very stable and didnot feel any swaying or jerking.

The views over Singapore and the Bay are just spectacular and well worth the price. It was not busy whilst we were there however the operation runs like a well oiled machine.

Definitely worth a visit.",,,
,,Wow!,5,,I usually have a fear of heights but had no problem with this flyer. You cannot even tell that you are moving. Singapore at night is really spectacular!,,,
,,Beautiful scenery for an affordable price,5,,"Definitely a must do if you're in Singapore. At $20-30 a head, you get to see most of Singapore from a bird's eye view. We went at night and the lights were super pretty, so would recommend going at night!",,,
,,Better ways to spend your money,3,,Our visit to the Singapore flyer was prompted by reviews and our use of similar wheels/flyers in other cities. The Singapore flyer is set in lovely gardens. But it only takes 35 minutes to go the full ride and the views you get can be seen free of charge from other buildings. No commentary means that you are reliant on other sources for information about what to look out for and the history of places. Although it's quite nice up there I would save your money and spend it on something else. The gardens by the bay beats this hands down,,,
,,Good views but not a must do.,4,,"A little difficult finding the correct entrance, then being sent back to pay at a not too well signed kiosk delayed things a bit. The views from the wheel are good, we went at night",,,
,,Stunning views,5,,"We had bought advance tickets for the Singapore Flyer before leaving the UK to ensure we had the opportunity to take a flight whist in Singapore, but were undecided whether to use them by day or night.

Having seen the light show in the harbour a night before we decided to see the light show in the Gardens by the Bay and then take a night flight.

We were not disappointed. Having experienced a number of 'flyers' around the world our experience of this was outstanding. Although we arrived for one of the last flights in the day, there were no queues and our ride was expedited without fuss and well worth the entrance fee.

There were around a dozen others in the capsule with us all of whom like us wanted to get the best view and take photographs. Everyone was polite and respectful and got what they came for ....... a spectacular view of Singapore by night.

It was possible to see the World of Palm, Supertree Grove from yet another vantage point together with the incredible Marina Bay Sands development, bay and impressive cityscape.

Had time permitted we would have taken a daytime flight too.

If in Singapore take the opportunity of a flight, I can highly recommend it.",,,
,,Nice sight,4,,A tourist attraction place. Catch the beautiful sight of Singapore day or night. A great experience.,,,
,,Must visit,4,,Aswum place to visit specially in evening . Beautiful place to see sunset. It's heart of Singapore..,,,
,,A fun attraction with super views,5,,Despite showers we had a fab view over the city....loved the experience A bit pricey....33$ each....but a good trip and worth it It turns slowly so isn't scary There are shops etc under it.....as well as a pretty tropical garden,,,
,,The night view of Singapore,4,,"By the time we get there, it was nearly 8.00 pm so there was only a few people.
There is only 4 of us in the capsule
The night view from the high is so amazing.
I don't know how 1 hour has passed
I have enjoyed with the view.",,,
,,Wonderful Evening/Night Views,5,,Amazing views in the evening. You can get a good look at the city from above. It doesn't disappoint. Worth every cent - and for a few bucks more - try getting a solo capsule for you and your partner - quite romantic...,,,
,,Great views,4,,"Bit pricey for the time but we enjoyed the view of Singapore and good photo opportunity. Best on a clear day, began to rain when we were at the top, but didn't spoil it too much.",,,
,,Reminds me of the Eye of London,3,,The flyer is very much like the Eye of London. It allows you to see Singapore and its outstanding architecture. A bit more pricey than I would prefer but a must do if in Singapore.,,,
,,2012 visit,5,,The Singapore flyer was a great experience and I really enjoyed looking at Singapore through it - it shows what a fantastic country Singapore is.,,,
,,Good,4,,"This ride is well done but it felt a little dated, with language hinting at being pilots/astronauts seemed corny for going up in a giant Ferris Wheel.

We hit this ride just before sunset and missed the crowds, which I would suggest to the next person. Because the empty queue we walked through was probably one to two city blocks. When we left there was a crowd forming and tourist buses coming. We went during 'off season' though.

The neon lights are irritating if you are trying to take photos and video because of glare, but not impossible.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Worth going on this as you do get amazing views of Singapore especially across the bay Good value although no price reductions for concessions unless living in Singapore. Much better than the London eye,,,
,,A must for your Singapore visit,4,,"This is a must for any trip to Singapore, amazing views, suitable for all ages, gives you a great perspective on the city and juts how many apartments there are ! As far as the eye can see. We went when it opened at 8:30am, highly recommend to get their early before the bus loads of tourist arrive. Unless you want to do the champagne or dinner option. It's walking distance from most hotels in the city. I was a bit disappointed their wasn't any information during the half hour ride on the flyer or any commentary on the city. That would have been a great addition to the tour.",,,
,,"Great views, no queues if you arrive early",5,,Arrive early and miss the queues. We managed to walk straight on and nearly had a pod to ourselves. The views are great (as you would expect). I would say this is a must do for a vacation in Singapore.,,,
,,Great view from the top,3,,"A good ride to see the view of the city and when the weather is clear, we may even see the islands in Indonesia. It is a good experience to see Singapore high-scrapers from the top view.",,,
,,Peaceful 30 minutes and a beautiful view of the city,5,,"We started out trip of the city with the flyer and were amazed by the 360 degree view of the entire city. We visited during the day time, but the I know that the evening time visit would also be as spectacular. It takes only 30 minutes for the ride so you can plan this visit along with many other attraction in this area on the same day. On the entrance they have a hall displaying various pieces of information about the flyer and its history. Tickets are available for purchase online.",,,
,,lovely way to view Singapore in the evening,4,,The flyer was very good but the entrance and area close by was not as the rest of Singapore. It needed a bit of a spruce up.,,,
,,Good View BUT Overpriced,2,,A very good experience and spectacular view but ticket price is very expensive and there is no discount for local. 30 mins of ride,,,
,,See for miles,5,,"Lovely way to get an overview of the city. Suggest going during the day so that you can get good pictures. If you go at night, it is difficult to get any good pictures because of the reflections from the lights on the glass. Worth the money for a full 30 minute rotation. Suggest buying tickets online to avoid the que.",,,
,,Spectacular view of Singapore through Flyer,4,,"The Singapore flyer ride was the most memorable moment of the Singapore trip. Special attention and care will be given by the staff if you are accompanied by senior citizens or children!!! The city view is just majestic! Best way to see all the iconic attractions of Singapore from one place, be it Marina Sands Bay, Merlion park , F1 track, Harbour view and what not!!! One of the must visit attraction in Singapore. Night view is much recommended!!!",,,
,,Birds' eye view,5,,"This is Asia鈥檚 largest observation wheel offering a bird鈥檚 eye view of the entire island city. The Flyer is also close to Marina Bay Sands. With a 360 degree view and enveloped in a capsule 165m above ground level you can see both iconic and historical landmarks such as the Singapore River, Merlion Park & Raffles Hotel in the 30 minute ride. You can see the Straits of Johor, Malaysia as well as neighbouring Spice Island. The spice was once the cornerstone of Singapore鈥檚 prosperity being shipped over the ocean from ancient lands. Pardon the pun but this ride offers a moving experience to one and all.",,,
,,"Rather dull, very touristy.",3,,"I find this quite soothing on a tired day but rather boring and frankly not worth the time or money...there are better attractions which offer more dynamic activity and good scenic views or environment...better off visiting the Zoo, Gardens By the Bay, Jurong Birdpark, HortPark, hike thru The Southern Ridges or
take the mrt to visit the numerous heartland estates in search of popular local markets & food haunts.",,,
,,Too slow,3,,It feels good only for first five minutes.. Too slow.. view from the flyer is just okay kind of.. just an average attraction,,,
,,A must in Singapore鈥?5.0,,"We lived inChangi Village hotel. but despite that you need to go on the Singapore Flyer! You get a great view of Singapore, try to go on it just as the sun goes down! Not open if it is thunder storms in the air! less",,,,
,,Just go and experience it.,5,,"Great view of the whole Singapore city within 30 minutes. You will see the skylines, the gardens by the bay and many more.",,,
,,Hmmmmm......not so sure....,3,,"I found this somewhat disappointing and expensive for about half an hour. Ok, you get an overview of the city, but you might as well skip this and go to the top floor of Marina Bay Sands.
I would certainly not rate it as a priority.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"The flyer was not busy when we visited, just 10 folk ahead of us so we soon boarded. Good views of the city skyline, The Fullerton and the river.",,,
,,City views by night !,4,,Beautiful views of the Marina & Central business district . Go by late evening just as lights of the city are coming up. Expensive but then worthwhile experience.,,,
,,Best way to see the Lion city,5,,"Still one of the best attraction of Singapore, Amazing view of the city and now you can have dinner too.",,,
,,Views were great,4,,Took a ride on the Singapore Flyer in the late afternoon and have a great view of the city and surrounding areas. A nice way to end a busy day.,,,
,,Birds eye view of Singapore,5,,The experience on the Singapore flyer is simply amazing. You get to a wide view of Singapore. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The street food experience is worth a try.,,,
,,30 minutes of dramatically changing city views,5,,"From a distance, one thinks that the Flyer is not moving, but up close you realize it is moving at a perfectly pleasant pace, changing the view continuously so that you cannot get bored. It is relatively expensive, but it is an unbeatable way to get a feel for the city's skyline and major structures very quickly.",,,
,,A must in Singapore,5,,"We lived in Marina Bay Sands hotel but despite that you need to go on the Singapore Flyer! You get a great view of Singapore, try to go on it just as the sun goes down! Not open if it is thunder storms in the air!",,,
,,Nice views with an interesting little bit of history to it.,3,,"Most people probably don't know that after the flyer was opened, the govt actually spent lots of money making it ...spin in the opposite direction all in the name of superstitions. This place is not so friendly towards travellers using public transport (except for taxis).",,,
,,Awesome,5,,"Flyer is one of the best adventure to visit in Singapore 馃嚫馃嚞. It should be the first priority for each person to visit and of all ages, as it is too slow and with great protection and safety..馃槉馃槉馃槉",,,
,,Must see,4,,"It was a nice experience. You can see the whole city, it is really impressing. The trip lasts 30 minutes. There were no brochures or any printed information in the cabin, though.",,,
,,The Sing Flyer,4,,Great way to see the city ... nice pace great for pictures and view! Kids loved the all glass gondola. A must do for Singapore.,,,
,,Not worth it,1,,The price was too much for a half an hour view of the city. Wasn't much for the 3 year old with us as well.,,,
,,Fabulous,5,,Good value and little queuing. Wonderful views of the city and port. Comfortable pod with central seating Takes around 30mins per journey,,,
,,360 view,5,,"Great view from the top, we had the flyer all to ourselves since the line was short but I believe if it's long they usually combine groups so make sure to visit during less crowded hours.",,,
,,Feb 2017 Holiday,3,,"Views are great, think this is slight overcharged at the cost of $33 SGD. If views excite you then definitely tick this off, if not don't waste your $$.",,,
,,Bigger than the London eye wheel,5,,"Bigger than the London eye wheel and ideally go on a sunny day or evening , it was cloudy when we went but the views were amazing of the city and the ships passing by Singapore",,,
,,Awesome and Spectacular views at its highest peak inside Singapore Flyer,5,,"You will have panoramic 360 view of the southern and eastern part of Singapore (Including Sentosa) and some islands of Indonesia. On those days where weather is good, you can even see the western part of Singapore.

Simply breathtaking as soon as the Flyer starts to ascend. It let you have the chance and opportunity to view most southern and eastern parts of Singapore at your own pace and time with the slow but steady speed of the Flyer.

The Day and Night sceneries and views provide different atmosphere and feelings especially during the Formula One Race days where you can see whole circuits of lights literally lit up the track and you can see tiny 'ants (cars)' running along the street lights.",,,
,,Briliant view of the marina bay,5,,One gets a spectqcular view of the marina bay area from the top of the flyer. Its more of a moving watch tower than a flywheel.,,,
,,Very good,4,,Excellent for a good view of Singapore especially if under time pressure. Smarter than the London eye I thought. They do offer evening drinks etc. but we went earlier in the morning - good thing to do as open before a lot of other attractions do. Close to a lot of other attractions too,,,
,,Must Do!,5,,"I was not really wanting to go, buy on the Last day I decided to go.
Altought I had seen everything having a look from the top is unique.
The cab is very big and very very spacy.
It takes 30 minutes to make a round trip, if you can make it in the early evening will be best time.",,,
,,Expensive ride,4,,"Takes 90 mins for one rotation and costs S$33, a bit pricey especiallly if you have the food option, then the price is Over S$200",,,
,,Fantastic views of Singapore,5,,Spoke nicely to young lady and got concessions for the Flyer. It was lovely clear sunny day. The ride is slow and serene providing wonderful views of Singapore. This is a must do attraction.,,,
,,good experience in secend merry go roung in the world,4,,if you have acrophobia you shouldn't try this one but if you do you can see all of singapore from up there in one sight,,,
,,Excellent!!!,5,,"I always used to think that London eye is highest but this 30 meters higher then london eye. It was fantastic we could actually see Indonesian islands, marina bay, garden by the bay, the skyline of Singapore amazing....must go....",,,
,,Breathtaking views of Marina Bay and the City,4,,"The Singapore Flyer was worth every penny. It offers unrivalled views of the city, top tip sit near the top right of the pod as you enter as this is the best position to view the Marina Bay Sands.",,,
,,Way better than expected.,4,,"Although it didn't look well placed to se over the city we were surprised how good this was, it's not the London eye but then at around 拢20 each we thought it was worth it.
Not at all busy when we went mid afternoon, we bought a ticket & walked right on without queuing.",,,
,,Efficient way to see some of Singapore's sights,4,,"If you've done the London Eye then you will have a very good feel for what this attraction is. The capsules are a good size, the views are terrific and if you are not afraid of heights then this is a good option for you.",,,
,,bad experience at singapore flier last week in a group of 11 couples,1,,"it was a very bad experience at singapore flier on 11th feb 2017. we got out from bus and started taking pictures from our camera . one of couple just stopped to take a picture and leave thier bag on the grass and by mistake they left the bag but within 5 minutes when we came back to see the bag . we dont found the bag when talked to security people about the same and told them to see on the cctv what happened and call the police . but they were very rude and behaved very badly they took approximatly 1 hour in hanky and panky discussions and not called the police . when asked our guide vinny who was localite of singapore she also not able to give us the police number and not helped us to call the police . when talked to driver of the van in which we had started for the city tour he also refused to go to police station . when told that we have hired you for complete day and u have to go wherever we say he finally agreed to took us to the nearby police station in all this useless talks and discussions we had lost approximatly 1.5 hour inspite of helping us they were not kind enough to even give us advise what to do .
the bag contains passports and approximatly 5000 dollars . when gone to police they also took 2 hour to lodge a complaint .and finally that couple missed the programme of cruise which was very bad experience
my main point to inform all world that whenever u go to singapore dont expact any help or anything like that from singapore people because they are very rude and unhelpfull. so if u go to singapore be coutious from the pickpockets and thiefs because if u trap in their racket u will not be helped by the security people and the localites .",,,
,,Flyer,4,,A very nice experience. From the top we can see the singapore completely. Night time the view was wonderful. If we want they will arrange the dinner with extra cost.,,,
,,Good 'Big Wheel' experience,4,,"We visited Singapore out-of-season, so the attractions were not crowded at all. There was no wait in lines. The wheel is very similar to the London Eye. The trip time is 30 minutes. Views are impressing. The spoken text is however very short and lacks information, and there were no brochures in the cabin which we used.",,,
,,Panoramic view of the City,5,,"If you wish to enjoy the panoramic view of the city then this is a must. enjoyed the spectacular views both during day and night time. so , suggest to go there at such a time so that the ride starts at day time and ends at dusk. A must.",,,
,,Highlight of our stay!,5,,"To see Singapore laid out beneath you is amazing. The organisation is superb, and there's lots to do in and around the site. Well worth the effort.",,,
,,Fabulous experience with lovely staff,5,,My husband and teenage son had a wonderful experience which made their Singapore experience even more fabulous. The staff are very welcoming and make you feel at ease and confident in what you are doing And as a spectator I could experience it too.,,,
,,I did it even with a fear of heights!,5,,This was amazing - don't skip even if you have a fear of heights - you can sit on the benches in the middle and really enjoy the view!,,,
,,Very nice experience,4,,Very Good experience . But cant feel the giantwheel moving at all. Very nicely maintained and very neat .,,,
,,Singapore skyline by night,5,,"Was a bit confusing to find entrance, needs more signage. Great tourist activity for those travelling through to stay awake for a connecting flight. Singapore is very colourful at night! We really were pleased we went. Would go on it again during the day 馃榾",,,
,,Good View...Good Food,4,,"Besides the great view I got from riding the Singapore Flyer, I like the food stalls here where you can get a real taste of Singapore food. The souvenir shops around have cute items also. But what I truly enjoyed that time was when I became a part of the percussion band who plays at the lobby to entertain people of their kind of music. You are free to join them, so grab some bongos and drumsticks and just hit it..! I truly enjoyed drumming jamming with the locals.",,,
,,Great experience,5,,"We strolled over to the Singapore flyer after being on a 40 minute bum boat tour of the waterfront.
There are very good views of the city from the waterfront.
The Flyer was very quiet, not many visitors so we had no problem getting our tickets and going through to the flyer itself.
We were also very lucky to have a capsule to ourself.
The flyer is 30 metres higher than the London Eye so a good head for heights is necessary.
The views are brilliant and the whole experience was very enjoyable.
Even the souvenir photo was good enough to buy as a keep sake.
We finished of our trip with a cheap meal from the food vendors located under the flyer.
We then walked over to the Sands Resort via the shopping mall and went even higher to the viewing platform at the top of the Sands Resort. More great views to be had!!",,,
,,Lovely view of the city,4,,We had our ride at the evening to enjoy the nigh city view. It took around half an hour to finish the ride.,,,
,,Good view of Singapore Financial area,4,,Very big wheel and extremely slow movement that you would feel any move at all. Best view is after 6.30pm.,,,
,,Really interesting,4,,"I walked to this nice sightseeing as you cant miss it .once you arrive Singapore you can see it from your airport way to your hotel , this was my first must see plan after discovering what was near my hotel, I walked all the way to the flyer and actually the weather in Feb is nice so I enjoyed it by the way the good news there is a prayer room there for Muslims so you wont miss your prayer time",,,
,,Good way to see the city,4,,We took the flyer up at night and got some great pano shots of the city skyline. I'm sure it would be great during the day as well. Being locked in a small cube with a screaming child for 45mins was the only downfall. I would recommend trying to get a seat on the right side of the benches so that you're facing out towards the city once you reach the top!,,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,It is awesome experience.. In flyer you see birdview of singapore..nice view..you can see management and cleaness of Singapore..,,,
,,Great views and ride,4,,"We have been on it a couple of times. Really depends on who are the other people in the same cabin. Sometimes we have it to ourselves which was fantastic but sometimes is a bother. Nevertheless excellent views of the sea, Marina Bay Sands hotel plus many more. Great views during the day but even better during the night. Prices are a bit steep but my family will take a ride everytime we are in Singapore. Surrounded by shopping, hotels and food. Transportation is not a problem getting to and from",,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,"My husband and I arrived in Singapore around 7am after a 14-day Asia Cruise aboard Seaborn Sojourn. We were in Singapore for the first time and only for a day as we were to catch our fight back early morning the following day . We asked around what's the iconic landmark in Singapore and they unanimously said the Singapore flyer , the Buddhist temples , Botanical gardens , etc . Since we couldn't see all of them in such a short period of time , we decided to just see the Singapore flyer . We took an Uber taxi around 7pm from our hotel to the location . We bought our tickets and we didn't have to wait a long time to ride the flyer . Each cabin could a accommodate at least 20 people and the flyer moved ever so gently as it went around the wheel and changed colors at the same time . We were able to see the whole city and took a lot of pictures as we went around slowly . It was an amazing experience !",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Amazing views from up the top. The pods are very clean which is to be expected in Singapore. The only thing that would've been handy was a map in each pod that point out some of the land marks. Entry was S$33 per adult. We had free passes, which was good, not sure we would've paid to go up there as it would've been an expensive outing for our family.",,,
,,Nice view,5,,"The ride felt quite short and when we were on the ride it begun to rain heavily. Sad experience, HOWEVER i could only imagine how good the ride is if it werent raining heavily.

The view is spectacular overlooking the whole of Singapore, a really must go must do thing if you visit Singapore. Would go again when i revisit Singapore, on a sunny period.",,,
,,Great views,5,,There were great views of Singapore and the grand prix track. It didn't have a feeling of movement. It's bigger than the one in London.,,,
,,Good Views,3,,"A typical tourist destination but great top see the views of Singapore in one go.
Another experience not for people scared of heights.
We had a lovely clear day which added to the experience.
The pods are air conditioned and the views look out over miles, really does give the city another dimension.",,,
,,Great views,5,,We visited the Flyer in October. It was easy to get tickets at the box office and the staff were very helpful. The views were amazing.,,,
,,Fantastic View,5,,This is a huge ride. We could see for miles. The perfect speed and seating. Plus I believe you could reserve one of the pods for a dinner at night. Lots of fun!,,,
,,Great experience,4,,What a view ! Felt very safe and was comfortable and smooth ride . Our pod was only occupied by us and one other family . Staff were really friendly and helpful .,,,
,,"Great views, cool and safe",5,,"A great way to see the cities vista in a comfortable, clean air-conditioned revolving car. It is well organised easy to get to and managed in a safe professional way.",,,
,,excellent exp,5,,"it was a very good exp in singapore, singapore flyer, awesome exp. must visit in singapore. dont miss if travelling to singapore",,,
,,Try to get in the weekdays to fully enjoy,4,,"if you come visit singapore you should definitely do the flying wheel. Try to get in the weekdays to have a booth where only you & your family can enjoy! Fellow travelers may perhaps be ""often"" disturbing.",,,
,,Memorable experience,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is a signature attraction of the restless city and I had the chance to use it twice, once during night and once during day time. As long as you're not into photography the night ride is probably more exciting than the day...More",,,
,,Wonderful views and worth the money.,4,,"The Flyer is very similar to the London Eye. It takes about 30 minutes to rotate, each pod holds 20 or so people and it offers spectacular views, especially of the Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay and surrounding area. It is well worth...More",,,
,,Nice View,4,,The flyer is pretty good. It costs $32 per person. Nice breeze can be felt touching the skin during the evenings. Good for all the age groups. The scenery is beautiful from this height and you can see almost entire Singapore from this height.,,,
,,Great view!,4,,"Go on the Singapore Flyer for a great view of Singapore and nearby islands. Good time to visit would be around sunset, that is, 6.30pm. There is a commentary on what you will be seeing as the 'wheel' turns.",,,
,,Modern marvel,5,,The views from the Flyer are simply amazing. We took the ride in the afternoon ....against the backdrop of overcast skies and a light drizzle Singapore looked marvellous. So smooth a ride that you don't feel its moving . Gives you a bird's-eye view of...More,,,
,,Must Do in Singapore trip with family,5,,"Viewing the city from , and enjoying it, gives a different pleasure. Rising above the tall buildings, and being able to see far and beyond is a lovely feeling. So this ride is a must-do for all age groups. Children too enjoy it. This is...More",,,
,,Lovely views,3,,"Singapore flyer was nice to do, but not necessarily a must do. There were great views. A bit pricey. Go on a clear day as views are clear.",,,
,,Must visit if you are the touristy type,5,,"If you are in Singapore and you are doing the regular touristy things then this is a must visit, not very long queues during the day, good views of the city",,,
,,Soar above the city (slowly),4,,"Well worth doing to help you get your bearings, this gentle but impressively high ride, in closed air-conditioned pods, gives you an eagle-eye view. I did it at sunset, which was very nice, but apparently the nighttime view is even better.",,,
,,Must thing to do.,4,,The Singapore Flyer is the same as the London Eye and others that have appeared across the world. It's worth a visit for an aerial view of the city and Bay Area . well worth booking in advance as queues can get long. We,,,
,,A lovely view of Singapore,5,,"We jumped on the flyer after visiting the garden and it was a lovely way to view the whole of Singapore. The ride was a half hour, plenty if space and not confining at all. Enjoyed it and would recommend it anyone who visits.",,,
,,A little boring but giid view,4,,I felt a little bored but the view at night was definitely awesome. I think the day view would be different but not as exciting.,,,
,,A bit over-rated but still a nice sight,3,,"Compared to the Paris wheel or the London eye, we felt this was a so-so. Firstly, the wheel overlooks the CBD and this while impressive is not too interesting. Secondly, cannot blame the location but since Singapore is incredibly small there is precious little in terms of historical sights you can view from there",,,
,,Fabulous Views of a vibrant city,5,,Unbelievably smooth ride which provides amazing photo opportunities and stunning views of the city. We travelled in the evening for the beautiful light displays but would be equally good during the day.,,,
,,Nice view of Singapore from the Singapore Flyer,4,,"Lovely panoramic view of Singapore from the Singapore Flyer. It takes approx. 30-40 minutes to complete one round of the flyer. The capsules are spacious with enough space to sit or stand and take photos. It takes some time to actually reach the Flyer capsule (considering longish queues), but the wait is worth it. The staff at the ingress and egress to each capsule are very courteous and willingly lend a helping hand to senior citizens.",,,
,,Nice views!,3,,"Not sure why we bothered taking this trip when we have experinced similar in the UK, but we did.

No queues which was great but the whole 30 min flight was compromised by two narcissistic couples who CONTINUOUSLY took photographs of each other for the WHOLE 30 MINUTES!!! Often standing right in front of my husband and I and showed us no consideration at all.

How rude...

Views were as expected but guessing my enjoyment and the content of this review were somewhat tarnished by our fellow travellers.
Unfortunately, you couldn't choose your travelling companions, just got into the pod with whoever was next to you in the queue.
Beware of anybody posing on the unlovely platform location because they're likely to be
A real menance once airborne.",,,
,,AMAZING CITY VIEW....,5,,"A must...there was no ques,,,took about 30 minutes,,,,had a great view of the F1 Track,,,,but also an amazing view of the City,,,,and the Sea...No expensive either.....",,,
,,A pleasant experience,3,,"My husband and I decided to go on the Flyer at night as we have already seen the city from the Marina Bay Sands during the day. Of course, there was a lovely view from the top and half an hour was plenty of time to see everything. In saying that, going to the observation deck at the Marina Bay Sands was cheaper, didn't have a time limit and in my opinion had better views.",,,
,,Majestic View!!,4,,"It was great experience riding in the Singapore flyer. You can view the sky scrappers of the Bay area. It gives a majestic view of MBS area, Gardens by the bay.",,,
,,Best view of the city,5,,The flyer offers the best view of the bay and the city as a whole. It has a variety of street food venues located in the centre below. Would definitely recommend this attraction!,,,
,,Great river views,5,,A beautiful view over the river...take a walk along here to see the city line. At night it lights up and is everso picturesque.,,,
,,Sunset,5,,Efficient ticketing and boarding with some interesting displays upon entry. The ride is comfortable and provides a very good view of the Singapore cityscape. Go early in the week to avoid congestion and aim for twilight. This way your journey begins in daylight and by the time you reach the apex you will see the sunset over Marina Bay. Then Singapore switches on the lights and the view is spectacular. Like all big wheels the obligatory tourist photos. But taking your camera and get there at the right time is well worth the effort.,,,
,,"Amazing views, terrific",5,,"What a wonderful experience. This goes very slowly, so it is not like a Ferris Wheel. You can enjoy incredible views of the bay. Sometimes can be a long que, just have to take your chances. Worth the wait!!!",,,
,,Just do it you won't be sorry,5,,"Let's face it Singapore is a picture postcard from most angles.
But for the ultimate vista it's an amazing experience to take a ride on the flyer.
30 minutes from start to finish great views comfortable cabin.
Good value attraction.
Some great food places around the attraction and it's location is easy to reach and link up to the marina.",,,
,,Can be seen,5,,"Singapore eye or flyer is just like another flyer. I think it is bit smaller ther Londen one. If you are short of time and seen other , you can give a miss. Otherwise it is worth seeing. you can have a beautiful view on clear day. All tourist activity all so starts from here like bus etc. so if you have spare time hope in.",,,
,,Best place for romance,5,,"The service here is awesome!
You could send emails to ask for any help.
I really appreciate the package they set for me for doing my proposal. Making an unforgettable memory here.

Hope someday I could take my own family here again to witness the place their dad get their mom's heart. Haha!!",,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,It's very good experience to get on capsule flyer to look out Singapore at night It's take about 30 minutes to be up there but I wish I could stay longer,,,
,,Singapore Flyer is a buzz,4,,"Don't miss the Singapore Flyer; it is exhilarating in itself, but it also provides a fantastic overview of the city, especially if you find it confusing at street level. Have your photo taken before embarking. It's right busy but worth the wait. And not too costly.",,,
,,All time High,5,,A great wheel a great view providing the air is clear (It can be hazy at times re burn offs in Borneo) air conditioned and we had a great time.,,,
,,Wonderful views,5,,We can see everything arround the city..from the giant wheels..wonderful sightseeing and nice sensation overthere.. at the top we just stop for a view minutes to see arround the city..,,,
,,must see,4,,"One of top five activities in Singapore, make sure you go on a nice clear day, it is best during the day. Expcet to soend about an hour there",,,
,,Evening visit,5,,It proposes a wonderful view over the Singapore including the area of Marina Bay Sands. I think it's better to visit it in the evenings so you can see the lights of the city,,,
,,"Facinating 40 minutes, but expensive",3,,The flyer hs become the thing to do in Singapore and is worth the experience once. It was quite mid week on our visit and there were no ques.,,,
,,Interesting place to visit,4,,All tour buses leave from this location. It has a good food court and a nice garden. The surrounding area is good for jogging too.,,,
,,Mixed feelings!,3,,"So this is on one of the must-do list of Singapore. I agree that it is a good experience but how unique, I am not sure. A tip maybe is that try to visit it during a clear sky and sunset time.",,,
,,must do,5,,best view ever only for $33 per pax u can enjoy bout 30 mins time can try afternoon and nte view u can see singapore in bright and dark view ever. this valentine can spend time go over,,,
,,Good experience,5,,"It is a good experience specially if you are visiting with kids. My kid just enjoyed going on the flyer. Nice view, preferred during evening so you get to see the lights around which is very beautiful.",,,
,,Great experience,5,,We took the ride at 1000 and had no queue at all and a cabin to ourselves. Spectacular views of the city during the 30 minute tour. Highly recommended,,,
,,Great views of the bay,5,,"It's nice during the day, and awesome during night(highly recommended).
You can see the most important part of the city, bay, MBS, Gardens, Financial District, all lightened up from a top view. It takes around 30 minutes a full tour.
You should not go there if it rains, the cabins will be wet and you will miss the views.
You can have a picture at entrance and they add you digitally to a nice background, to sell it as a souvenir. It's nice, but a bit to expensive.
You might want to take a private cabin and having a romantic dinner also.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer Magnificent,5,,"My wife, daughter and I visited the Singapore Flyer for an amazing ride and views of night time Singapore. To be 165 metres high and view the lights of Singapore travelling at low speed is one for the ""bucket list"" We arrived at approx. 7pm and did not have any waiting to purchase tickets or join the ride.",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"We took this ride recently on our first night in Singapore, there was a very short wait for the tickets and even less of a wait for us to get into the capsule. The views are fantastic and at night everything is so colourful its a good way to get a perspective as to where everything is located once your up in the air. We enjoyed the ride and would do it again the next time we are in Singapore",,,
,,Good views,5,,"The Flyer offers good views of Singapore , brilliant experience They take a photo of you & then show you in 6 different views on the flyer , cost is 25 dollars for one & 60 dollars for six",,,
,,Great View....,5,,It is a great place to visit while in Singapore. It offers a bird's eve view of the city. it also has a wonderful garden and a souvenir shop with cool stuff as well... Definitely a must visit while in Singapore.....,,,
,,Great fun,5,,"This giant ferries wheel is called by its operators ""an observation wheel"". It's great fun to ride in one of its air-conditioned ""bullets"" and slow catch in the magnificent views.",,,
,,Loved it!,5,,"If you're ever in Singapore, don't miss a ride on the Singapore Flyer. Very well run with plenty of affable, polite staff and the sights are a joy to behold. Excellent value too, as the ride lasts 30 mins and is totally leisurely. Thoroughly recommended.",,,
,,For first timers this is great!,5,,"Provided me a 360 view of Singapore, I think it's one of the tallest ferris wheel. Though nothing else to do, but just admiring singapore skyline was enough to fill my time while my family go shopping.",,,
,,Bird's eye view!,4,,I prefer the night view of Singapore from the top so it was a prefect choice to go after 9pm. A full 360 visual of Singapore's cityscape was beautiful from the Gardens of the Bay to the Singapore River and Marina Bay Sands. The flyer moves at a relatively slow pace so you can enjoy the view and capture your moments.,,,
,,Stunning View,5,,Higher then the London Eye and the largest observation wheel in Asia. 28 large capsules offering stunning views of the city and the river. Best to visit in the evening.,,,
,,the views,5,,"great Views of singapore & Marina bay, from different ankles and heights, defenitely a must do, in my opinion. even though a Bit pricy at first sight, absolutely worth it",,,
,,View Singapore skyline,4,,"If you wish to see Singapore from a birds eye view, this is the best place to be, I would recommend you hop in the ride at 5.30 pm (sunset time) and then you will be able to enjoy the sunset and then by the time ride gets finished you can see the nighttime skyline, that's a win win situation, you can take your date out for a lovely romantic dinner as well and charges for that will be different but they don't serve multicuisine dishes so you may want to check the menu before booking. You can buy the tickets online if you want to avoid the queue but we got the tickets on the spot and we didn't have to stand in the queue for a long time. If you can fit an hour in your itinerary then go for it.",,,
,,an hour to Relax,4,,"ok so you are tired now ?
just go to Singapore Flyer,
you have to buy a ticket,
and once you are inside,

you can relax till it takes the complete round,
to show you the singapore view slowly from the top.

its a good place to spend some time.
and also to have a good aerial view while you sit and relax.

Good place to visit",,,
,,A good overview of singapore,5,,The flyer is recommended if you wish to have a nice view of the place from above ..it moves slowly allowing enough time to enjoy the view,,,
,,Singapore tour,5,,Fantastic view of Singapore from Singapore flyer. Each cabin accommodates 8 persons & there are 28 such cabins. The flyer moves 360 degree to have full view of city around. Wheelchairs are also made available for needy persons. It takes almost 45-60 min to complete the circle.,,,
,,Lovely views but expensive,4,,"The ticket office was undermanned so waited a bit thankfully in the shade, the entrance was well organised and we only waited a few minutes to get a pod to ourselves. It's not cheap so felt it was overpriced although the views are nice.",,,
,,Panaromic Views,4,,"This flyer is like a slow moving ferris wheel with glass capsules that doubles up as an observation deck. We had a 360 degree view of the city. Visited this during the day, but we will recommend an evening visit as it looks so pretty when lit up",,,
,,"Spectacular attraction, awesome views.",5,,"We took the MRT to closest station and then walked the 5 minutes here. Cost was $33.00 to enter and so worth the fee. The ride takes about 30 minutes, truly impressive views and a cool experience. Wasn't very busy so there was only 6 other persons in our ""capsule"". Was very spacious and gave awesome city views. This is said to be largest of its kind in the world and we really thought it was worth the time. Very similar the London's wheel called the London Eye. Very clean, safe and well done !! Lots of interpretive displays before your ride with neat facts ..",,,
,,Singapore by night.,5,,"Singapore Flyer
Located next to the harbor, this gigantic wheel gently elevates you to heights that one does not perceive movement. We took this 38 minute ride during the night (8 PM) and on a Saturday. The visibility was excellent although 4 hours earlier, a squall roared thru the city. The different building lights made for a colorful viewing. Such an awesome view. The gondola/capsule was not packed. Temperature inside the gondola was comfortable considering that Singapore is only a mere 90 miles above the equator. The ticket line took a mere 5 minutes and another 8 minutes of queue to get to the gondola. All done in under an hour.
Highly suggested.",,,
,,get to see the aerial view of singapore,4,,i have been on the london flyer before hence this one was pretty much the same experince .. the wheel moves very slowly and you have ample time to enjoy the view in detail.. people start getting bored after a while though...,,,
,,Fantastic,5,,I rebelled during the day but think this would be much better at night. Very safe as you are fully enclosed and perfectly ok even if heights scare you. I went during the day and there was no queue although not sure if this would apply at night.,,,
,,Fantastic Views,4,,"The flyer is well worth a visit for amazing views of Marina Bay and the city. A whole rotation takes about 30 minutes. Loading the capsules is very organised and easy even with a young child. We pre-booked our tickets, after queuing in line at what I thought was the ticket sales desk to redeem them, it tuned out to be a separate desk around the corner inside! The photo counter after our flight was very slow and disorganised but we enjoyed our visit overall.",,,
,,Surprisingly Decent,3,,"Reluctantly did this as something you ""have to do"" in Singapore and was surprised how enjoyable it is. If you like heights and views, this is a pretty good way to see the city without paying cover at Ce la vie.",,,
,,great view of singapore city,4,,The attaction offers a very beautiful view of the city and the sea. Easy to access via marina bay. nice to visit.,,,
,,Enjoyed,4,,Great views as expected and air conditioned pods were definitely welcomed. Getting tickets on the day was really easy. Worth a visit.,,,
,,Awesome View of Singapore!,4,,Visited with my family. The view and the experience is very unforgettable! I would love to go back for this!,,,
,,Spectacular view,4,,"We had visited this as a family with a toddler.. Tickets can be booked online which is preferable, but as we were visiting on a weekday there wasn't any queue.
The view from the flyers is very good especially if you go in the evening at around 6 pm during sunset.",,,
,,Wow experience,5,,"visited with family in April 2016.The ticket costs are;

For adult-S$33
For Kid: S$21

You have 2 options to buy the ticket-
1)either online

(or)
2)Over the counter (0830-2200 hrs)

The experience: A must visit especially if you are with your family.
Tip: Try to gather information about the landmarks which you will be seeing when you are riding on the flyer, which would be definitely interesting.",,,
,,Great view of Singapore,4,,"After doing most things in Singapore we left this to last as it didn't have much to it, is been on the London Eye and thought it would just be the same but different view... well it was, not busy at all and you didn't have to wait long and I went on a Saturday.",,,
,,View from the top,4,,"Beautiful views from the top of Singapore... Got to take tons of photos... Singapore is a beautiful city, clean, very modern and futuristic. The ride is about 30 minutes long so make sure you go the the restroom before you board the capsule.",,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Good to see the city from the highest point. One of the must watch in Singapore within a short span of time.,,,
,,Osum Veiw,5,,Jus now time 3 pm I visited the flyer along with my wife it's amazing and true as per what I had been hearing bout it that its largest into the Asia well I must admit we get all 360degree view from top and can able to see ports buildings all vicitiny area fro top that one can't imagine also that Singapore is so wide had lots of fun clicked lots of pic and took a best memories from here on my last day of tour.,,,
,,Great experience,5,,"We were lucky enough to pick Chinese New Year's Eve to visit so it was exceptionally quiet. No queues, straight on and only five more people in pod with my husband and I. Great views an overall fab experience.",,,
,,Great attraction,5,,Been on many ferris wheels but this one was the biggest I've been on so far. Provides a great view of the city and the private party or dine car is just a great idea!! Keep it up.,,,
,,Amazing views,4,,"Very expensive, but the views you get makes it worth it. Nice journey in satisfactory length of time. Recommended.",,,
,,Found nicer views from other skyscrapers,3,,Taking the flyer was a nice experience when i did it 9 years ago but then when repeated it last week it just wasn't the same. There used to be a recording that tells you what you see from 360 degrees around you now it's gone so you're basically just going around without paying attention to the small details since you're not being told what's around you. I found better views from roof tops around the city but one thing i gotta say about the flyer - kids just love it so it might be a good attraction for them!,,,
,,Done it once then give it a miss !,3,,Like everything else so so so expensive... quite big queues ... if you have done it in another country I.E. UK The Londo Eye then its the same again keep your money in your pocket .. if the first time give it a try ! I suggest buying a set of tours it's much much cheaper ! Again it's novel the first time ... enjoy I wasn't inspired however the views are beautiful !,,,
,,"Fantastic views,",4,,"This was great, we viewed many of the places we had visited on foot or boat , this time from the air. Was a great end to our very short stay in Singapore.",,,
,,Views that entrall,5,,The Singapore Flyer is an experience that you should take if you have the opportunity - the views over Singapore are truly spectacular and stunning :),,,
,,Singapore flyer,3,,"The singapore Flyer was amazing, huge, nice and a beautiful scenery when you get to the top. Although, it takes a long time to get to the top it took me about 2-3 hours.",,,
,,Must do @ Singapore,5,,"You cannot get better glimpse of Singapore skyline and natural landscape than this. It take 45 minutes, I think to complete one round and by that you get to see 360 degree view if this fantastic city. Take your camera to take great shots and yes, go early in the morning when crowd is less.",,,
,,Quite an experience...,4,,Due to crowds ..sometimes overbooked...and may need to wait...as for the view...especially at night...something else...staff were helpful...,,,
,,Great views,5,,"This was great! one whole hour to go around amazing views of Singapore loved it, relaxing too. Great for the whole family, you can take in a lot of singapores beautiful city, some great photos from here.",,,
,,Gives excellent view of the city,5,,Capsules much like the London eye but much higher- not for the faint hearted ! Give a fabulous view of the city.,,,
,,Absolutly Fantastic,5,,"Booked the vip champagne flight.
We had the Moet Capsule to our selves. We were met in the VIP Lounge and escorted to the capsule where we served Champagne and Chocolates.
It was an amazing experience.
Fantastic viiews and really professional.This is the best way to celebrate a special event.",,,
,,Fantastic way to end our trip,4,,Fantastic views of the city - worth doing after you've walked around so you can recognise where you've been. Sights identified inside the pods.,,,
,,One of the tallest in the world!,5,,No tourist should miss this attraction. You will have a good 360 view of Singapore - taking about an hour to finish. There are food outlets at the base. You can also choose to set a romantic dinner inside your capsule with a waiter/attendant.,,,
,,Lovely evening views,5,,Went here one evening on a cloudy day. Absolutely relaxing and loved every minute of the ride. And the views were gorgeous.,,,
,,A must-do activity,4,,"Even though we loved ION Sky, we really enjoyed the Flyer. Spacious cabin, it was worth the $. Easily accessible by public transport.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"If you want to view the whole city of Singapore, you should try Singapore Flyer. Night view would be better but we have tried day view. This was also interesting. I am normal scared of height but this time was really no problem.",,,
,,Very nice to see the view from top,5,,Very nice to see the view from top. Neat and clean location. Can see across the island due to the height. Must see for a visitor.,,,
,,Eye on Lion City,5,,"Enliving the childhood days, getting on the ferris wheels. Its just that we're in the huge air-conditioned capsule and its exterior lighted ups as night falls. Onward Singapore!",,,
,,Massive !,5,,You have two choices - day time or night time ! We chose night time as I wanted to get some photos of the harbour area under lights. We arrived about 9pm and walked straight in with no queuing. The wheel is very smooth but don't look directly down unless you have a head for heights. I think a must visit if you're in Singapore,,,
,,Great views of Singapore,4,,"Took the flyer at night and there are some pretty fabulous views of the city to be had. The flyer moves rather slowly and is very sturdy so you won't experience any wind even at its zenith.

However, unfortunately, the glass is not glare proof and there is no full length, bar free window, which is a real bummer if you are looking for photos. Probably a good one time activity. Kids will love it.",,,
,,Not as good as the MBS Skypark,3,,We've done this a few times. It's about an hour's experience riding the circle. The view can be nice and it is air-conditioned (important here). But you time and money are better spend going to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. The Flyer does have a few shops and restaurants but nothing special there.,,,
,,A little bit disappointed,3,,"Was a little bit disappointed by the Singapore Flyer, maybe because I had high expectations and also I visited it just after the Marina Bay Sands skypark (which is amazing). Technically I guess it is an achievement but you are ""locked"" in a cabin for almost an hour, which is too long. Also I did it at night, it might not be the best timing of the day to do it.",,,
,,A must visit,5,,Not as large as the London Eye but a far better view. Takes about 15-20 minutes for the full circle Magical views of the harbour and surrounding district.,,,
,,View of Singapore,5,,"It's just like london eye in London. From here you can see singapore straits, F1 Racing track, Durian Stadium & financial buildings if singapore. It takes around 25 minutes to complete one round & would recommend to visit.",,,
,,"If you wish to be on top of the world without spending much effort, this is it.",5,,"An excellent creation of engineering, architecture and design! You are in a comfortable capsule quietly rising to the top without the feeling of being lifted. One can see far beyond, perhaps to Malaysia and Indonesia in a cloud free day; even otherwise the views are just splendid, offering photo opportunities for a memorable holiday.",,,
,,Great way to see Singapore,5,,The view of Singapore at night was fantastic. Due to only 2 full days in Singapore we chose to go at 8:30pm so we could also see the light show at Gardens by the Bay from there at the same time. Singapore is such a beautiful city and this is a great way to see it.,,,
,,Valentine's Day dinner!,4,,"Had our special Valentine's Day dinner onboard the Singapore Flyer! Went a total of 3 times round and its was fun watching the waiters and waitresses rushing in and out! Not enough time to dine and enjoy the scenery plus take photos of both!! Not much of a scenery too except at that height, sun set can look amazing!",,,
,,singapore flyer,5,,this is a huge wheel with big cabinswith glass view . it is built in the primearea of singapore from wher we can see the city coastal line and the sea . it is beautifully lighted . best time is dusk .,,,
,,Great view of the downtown area from the Flyer,5,,"We toke the Hop On Hop Off Bus around and the Flyer is on the route. The bus drops and picks you up right there. The ride is very easy to bet on and off for anyone not sure footed, a great view of the city.",,,
,,A worthy visit,5,,"The view alone is breathtaking. They have dinner tables in some of the carousels, with prior planning one can enjoy dinner high above the ground.",,,
,,Amazing view of NYE fireworks,5,,"We booked the NYE Champagne Flight in order to see the Marina Fireworks.
It was so amazing!!!
They only open 6 pods and there is an average number of 20 persons per pods.
We were boarding around 11:45PM and then the Flyer started to move. By midnight, we were at the highest point, looking down at the Marina where the fireworks are starting. We got an amzing first rate view of the whole show.
Wow!!! It was the best NYE we ever had.",,,
,,Lovely views. Take it at sunset for best of both times,4,,The views are amazing. It is nice slow 1 hour ride and we had the capsule to ourselves when we went.,,,
,,Beautiful Singapore views,4,,We hadn't planned on doing this originally and decided to do it at the last minute just before sunset. There were no lines so we were able to go straight on. The views were amazing and we were very happy that we decided to do it. It is a bit expensive however we got great photos and it was a nice chance to relax for 30mins.,,,
,,"Okay it is touristic, but also big fun",4,,"The flyer itself gives a great view and it takes 30 minutes to finalise the round. 2 things were dissapointing; at night the pictures are not so good because of the reflections in the windows of the cabin. It should be an idea to have a few minutes of darkness at the top to satisfy the photographers. Also annoying, matter of luck, are the screaming and running children. Some parents seem to find such behavior in a closed and limited space adorable, for other participants it is annoying. Must do; take an ice cream just in front of the flyer; delicious!!! And spend some time to eat it at the waterfront. Romantic!",,,
,,A must do,5,,"This is the highest smoothest ride with the best views you will ever go on. Panoramic views to ocean, river, city scape etc etc",,,
,,A beautiful circle,5,,A big Motian. Better come here in the evening. The sunset make it different. A beautiful big circle rising from the sea. Many tall buildings around it.,,,
,,30 minutes worth it all the way,5,,Its the tallest one in the world as told by the guide. London wheel is the 2nd tallest. It apparently moves. Met very fine Indian people and admired the view all together as a group.,,,
,,Great way to see Singapore,5,,Easy to get to from MRT links. Amazing views of Singapore. Helpful staff. Would be amazing at night time.,,,
,,Great place,5,,The place which you definitely mus go. The place you will never forget. The flyer give you great view.,,,
,,Dinner at Singapore Flyer!,5,,"If you planing to visit Singapore, then this is a must-to-go. The ticket cost about S$40-50. I don't quite remember. But very well, we was there in evening and all the lights from the buildings, Marina Bay Hotel, garden, bay and so on... was so beautiful especially from that high point. The cab moves relatively slow so you have a lot of time to take photographs. But what shocks me the most was that the cab don't stop when the passengers entering and leaving the cab, so you have to hop in and out as it's moving. Kinda risky but fun^^ Also if you planing to go there on the evening, you might see people having dinner in on of the cabs. The wheel only stops when they're serving food to the guest. A fun thing to see^^",,,
,,Relaxing,5,,"It was a pleasant half an hour ride. The view from the top was unmatched. The staff were very friendly. For Muslims, there is a small prayer room on the ground floor.",,,
,,A definite must do,5,,"We rode the Singapore Flyer in the morning not long after 9.00am. The Flyer will give you a great view of all the attractions of Singapore including the city buildings, Marina Bay Sands, Merlion (need to zoom in), the Grand Prix track, the Super Tree Grove, Gardens by the Bay complex (Cloud Forest & Flower Dome). The day we visited was relatively clear and the ride took approximately half an hour to go around. We thoroughly enjoyed the tranquility of the ride. At this time there was no queue at all. The advantage of the morning is the sun is behind you for photographing most of the important buildings to the West.",,,
,,Good expereince for the kid,3,,It was good. Took my daughter to experience it. Nice view and the weather was clear. Went in the evening at about 5pm. The food nearby was not very good. Ate Nasi Lemak and Chicken Rice. Both not worth.,,,
,,Don't bother,2,,"These ferris wheels are becoming common is cities with lots of tourists, but Singapore doesn't need one. The attractions in Singapore are all at eye level.......walking around in Chinatown or Little India, shopping on Orchard Road, eating at one of the many food stalls. Enjoy Singapore by walking and eating, not by spending a boring hour in a Ferris Wheel that offers you a look at a skyline that really isn't all that inspiring.",,,
,,Exceptional views of the Signapore skyline!,5,,"A must do for all travellers to Singapore!
Amazing 360 degree views of the Singapore city and skyline from 160m in the air. The flyer takes 30 minutes to go around and gives you plenty of time to get that perfect photo from above! If you fancy a more moving trip, you can purchase a capsule with a drinks package or a nice dinner package with a view!
Best quiet time to go: during the day or afternoon to avoid queues
Best time to see it: late afternoon during sunset or 8pm to watch the light shows! (very busy time + on weekends)",,,
,,One from many must see places,4,,nice view from comfortable cabin at beautiful Singapore. It takes only 30 mins but you can enjoy nice view.,,,
,,Night ride on the S'pore Flyer,5,,We went at night as the fireworks and laser show were going off at the Sands. Only had 6 in our pod which was nice. Some incredible views and lots of fun.,,,
,,Good Views,4,,"Worth a go , takes around half an hour and good views looking out over to Marina Bay Sands and the F1 start finish straight .",,,
,,Good For A Spin,4,,"Yes, it is very touristy, and has absolutely nothing to do with local culture, but it is an indulgence that allows you to get some fantastic views of Singapore City (and Island), in a manner quite different from having to be elevated up a tall tower. There are also a number of other sights available nearby, which makes this attraction something that can be adjoined with others, to create a memorable day of your stay in Singapore (if not already a local resident).",,,
,,Awesome,5,,"Must do things in singapore. Very beautiful scene of singapore from top of the flyer. Awesome view of city, ocean, marina bay garden. Go, go, and go there.....",,,
,,Fantastic View of Singapore!!,5,,"One should surely visit this Flyer in Singapore, which will give you an birds eye view of the city. Overall very well maintained and nice staff",,,
,,must visit,5,,"One must visit this place. Amazing experience!! nice place to take selfie, one can see almost the whole city from top.",,,
,,Singapore's panromic view,4,,Best way to have a panromic view of the City. Its a 30 min. ride with a breathtaking view. One must go during the sunset. Tickets can be purchased thru their website as well.,,,
,,Must thing to do in Singapore,5,,If you want to enjoy the view of singapore skyline this should be done. 30 mins in Singapore flyer were the best 30 mins in Singapore. The view in the night is breathtaking,,,
,,Breathtaking View,5,,"Good value (compare with other Singapore attraction) The view is amazing, get there around 8pm to see the light show. Very smooth queuing flow for getting in, not crowded. The cabin are large ! It takes 30 minutes to complete 1 round, plenty of time to take great pictures of singapor skyline ! A MUST DO",,,
,,"Go first thing, for no queues.",5,,"Great ride - we went first thing, shortly after opening. No queues, and got a 'capsule' all to ourselves. Terrific views over the F1 track, and the Marina Bay area.",,,
,,"Loved the ""Flyer""",5,,"This was our first time on any of the ""Flyers"", and thoroughly enjoyed it. Views were totally amazing of the city, and there was only 1 other couple in our ""pod"". Decided at the last minute to go on as a stop on our Hop On/Hop Off bus we took. You really get a wonderful sense of the city and the architecture on this attraction. We were lucky there were no lines the day we went, and although a bit overcast, the views were still wonderful.",,,
,,A singapore must!,5,,You cant visit Singapore without going on this. Everytime the Grand Prix is on you will see it and think 'why didnt I' otherwise. it is laidback and passes the time relaxing you as you get a good view of the city and Gardens by the Bay etc.,,,
,,Wonderful views of the beautiful city of Singapore,5,,I enjoyed this experience even though I do not have a head for heights. I felt safe as the pod is very slow moving.,,,
,,Great way to see the city,5,,Got here early in the morning to avoid the queues and the heat of the day. Lots to see and a great start to any sight seeing tour.,,,
,,View Singapore from the heights,5,,"This slow moving safe Flyer has large carriages with seating. the views of Singapore are fantastic. The night lights are superb with views to the Sands, Marina Bay and the famous Gardens by the Bay",,,
,,"A must to do, see Singapore from the sky.",5,,"Bigger that the London Eye this observation wheel takes 30 minutes to do a full rotation, the Flyer is on the hop on / hop off bus route.
The capsules are very roomy and are air conditioned, you set off over part of the Formula 1 circuit and then go higher with views over the golf course and the sea where you will see a multitude of cargo ships waiting to dock.
As you get to the top the view of the city is something like you have never seen before you also see the Gardens on the Bay as well. Money and time well spent and again very friendly staff.",,,
,,Brilliant view,5,,Hard to get to on the last night of f1 but was well worth the crazy taxi ride and to see it with no one else on the wheel at all was worth the crazy journey needed to get through the closed roads,,,
,,5* PLUS,5,,Fantastic view. Had the car to ourselves so plenty of room to move around and take photographs Trip on the Flyer took about 35 mins.,,,
,,A View Of Singapore.,5,,"The Singapore Flyer isn't unlike the London eye. Its pods offer you breathtaking views of Singapore and its skyline, from way up in the sky. The lights and beauty of the Lion City will leave you dazzled and amazed. It's well worth a ride!",,,
,,Great Way to see a Overview of the City,5,,"This is a great way to enjoy the Singapore Skyline. At night and sun down a added bonus is the sunset and Singapore lights. The basic package is one rotation of the flyer which is 30 minutes. They also offer dinner packages, bar packages, and private viewing cars. For F1 Fans the Flyer is right next to the Grand Prix Start/Finish line, Grandstand, Pit Area.

Well worth a trip here.",,,
,,Fantastic views....bigger than the London Eye,5,,Great value experience. Large cabins. The views all over Singapore are stunning. Go n a clear day. Would highly recommend as #2 must do after #1 Gardens by the Bay,,,
,,Beautiful,5,,The view of the Singapore was great and we went on the flyer in the evening so it made it more colorful...there is even cabins with dinning so you can eat and observe entire Singapore.,,,
,,"Air conditioned, great views",5,,"I thought this would just be another tourist trap, but it was a lot better than that. You climb into air conitioned compartments and slowly obtain wonderful 360 degree views of Singapore and the Bay. You can get great photos from up here too. It's a great way to start your visit in Singapore to get your bearings and see where things are.",,,
,,Awsome,5,,Loved every bit of this experience. Not too pricey and it was nice to have a whole pod to ourselves. Shows Singapore at its finest. Would highly recommend....... even for the people like my husband who does not like heights i managed to get him on and he loved it.,,,
,,Wow! of a Kind Experience,5,,"It's like you didn't went to Singapore if you haven't seen, or better, hopped in on this mega ""ferris wheel"" or observation wheel overlooking the whole business district and nearby region in Singapore as far as your eyes can see. You can view the Singapore skyline 360 degrees through a glass walls of the ""capsules"" which are air conditioned. I have been there on a day and night ride and both gives different unique ""feels"". The glittering lights of the structures, skyscrapers, road lights, decos pleasing to the eyes. During day time, you can see the actual look of the surroundings in broad daylight. The wheel turns really slow so you can get every chance to take photos. We went there as a family, and we were with some fellow tourists inside. It was really fun. I saw you can actually rent (at a price) a capsule for a candle lit dinner with your special someone.",,,
,,Lovely to Look At,3,,"This place is lovely to look at. Upon arrival we weren't very interested to go up the ferris wheel as there were not much people as well. There are few shops and restaurants at the base of this attraction which makes it a bit boring, but I suppose riding the actual ferris wheel would make the experience a bit different.",,,
,,great views,5,,"Great views on the flyer ,they were setting up for the F 1.you can see all the ships anchored off shore , around the marina",,,
,,Relaxing with spectacular views,5,,A wonderful experience for the whole family and it was so nice to travel on an 'eye' without feeling Jam packed into a cabin. A relaxing half hour rotation that I would recommend to everyone visiting Singapore .,,,
,,Really worth a look,4,,Worth a look. I went early in the morning when it was clear and there was very few people around. Great way to get an overview of Singapore,,,
,,Fun trip to the Top,4,,"Not as big as the ""eye"" of London but you will get some very impressive views of the Singapore skyline. Worth doing but not if theres along line.",,,
,,Best views at night,5,,Very well organised. If you go at night the views are stunning and if you go between 8.45 and 9 you'll see the light show at Marina Bay gardens.,,,
,,Wow....,4,,Have a 360 view of marina bay with our own eyes. Kids were happy and our capsule just for us so they got picture as much as they can,,,
,,Not enough view to stay interested,3,,There is not sufficient interesting sight to keep occupied for the whole ride. Maybe some features to be added within the cabin to complement the storytelling of the history of Singapore,,,
,,Wonderful experience,5,,"It was new year eve. What an experience it was. Fire works display was so beautiful and nice. There were thousands of people to witness.

When it comes to flyer I would say it is a place must visit and to take a ride.

Price of course not that cheap but to see that wonderful view of Singapore you need to pay a price too.",,,
,,Flyer,5,,"Singapore Flyer has always attracted the attention of tourists. It is built on the coast of Marina Bay Bay. Each cabin is equipped with air conditioning, so that passengers can comfortably enjoy the vistas. And have something to enjoy: the visibility of the top point is 45 kilometers in diameter, is seen here not only almost all of Singapore and the surrounding area, but also Malaysian and Indonesian islands. Overall turnover of the Singapore wheel takes 28 minutes.",,,
,,Incredible experience,5,,One of the wow experience. We bought tickets on the spot. We could see entire Singapore from this flyer. Must experience ;),,,
,,Beatifully view,5,,Best view to see entire Singapore. About 128 km high and it takes about 29 min to complete the ride. Amazing experience.,,,
,,Amazing!,5,,"Thoroughly enjoyed this. The wheel takes 45 minutes to go round and the views are amazing! It cost us 33 Singapore dollars each, which equates to about 拢18 pounds at current exchange rate per adult. The views were spectacular, we were lucky as it was a really clear day, we could even see Malaysia in the distance. We got there just after 10am (it opens at 10am) and we're glad we did as we beat the crowds! We didn't pre-book our tickets as you can buy them there. We were staying at the Pan Pacific Orchard and it only cost us 10 dollars each way, including tips to get there.
Thoroughly recommend anyone doing this whilst in Singapore!",,,
,,Fabulous views,4,,"Easy to get to by MTR; only a short walk. Views were spectacular, although a certain lack of professionalism within the other sectors, such as catering.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,3,,"Nothing more than average and overrated. At least in the day time. Weather wasn't optimal. We had a 'singapore sling fligt'. Drink was ok and it was only four of us in the capsule and no waiting. Anyway there were no lines anywhere. If I could choose again, would go there in sunset or dark.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"I think my partner and I were the only people actually on the wheel, we had a huge capsule all to ourselves. Would recommend this no problem.",,,
,,Fabulous view,5,,I visited at midday so it was very quiet as it was a hot day but there was no line and I was the only person in my pod. A beautiful clear day to see the stunning skyline and get a good feel for the city layout. Good value for money.,,,
,,Great experience,5,,We visited in November very nice view of Singapore enjoyed every bit of it. It was great experience with my family.,,,
,,Excellent Experience,5,,"A great experience to see Singapore but in as much as the view from the top, the marvel of how the Flyer wheel moves is an experience in itself. Dont miss the opportunity to see the artifacts about the Flyer which are done nicely while getting to Flyer. If you are lucky depending on the crowd you can get an entire cabin for yourself. Takes about half and hour. Great views of the Harbour and coast as well as Singapore city itself.",,,
,,Pricey but worth a visit,4,,"Singapore is a very colourful and brightly lit city and looks marvelous at night. Viewing it through the flyer is an unique experience even though like everything else in Singapore, is a costly affair!",,,
,,Birds Eye View of the beautiful city,4,,Provides a good view of the city and the sea. Remember to board close to 7PM so you can see the view in sunlight and also at night. Sunset in Singapore is around 7:10PM. Do note that. For $33 it is money well spent. There are some cabins that are priced higher with other offers such as a private cabin for a romantic dinner etc. The normal cabins have upto 32 people each and it can get a bit uncomfortable if there are small crying children in your cabin.,,,
,,Relaxing fun and great views,5,,"We have been on the Flyer twice. I was amazed at how well organized and kind the service is all the way on and off the Flyer. It takes quite awhile all in to get there and the ride itself, so be prepared to allow for about two hours. The views are of course very nice. Younger kids might get bored but it is still worth it for them and for bigger people, very relaxing. I also marveled at the construction of the Flyer while riding.",,,
,,Must Visit!,5,,A very nice place to go with Family and kids. My nephews was so excited. I can see Garden by the bay from here.,,,
,,You can miss this ride if you want.,3,,Not as exciting as anticipated. you get a good view of the city but that you can get from any tall hotel if you are staying in one. thought it was a waste of time and money.,,,
,,Viewing the surrounding from the top,4,,Not a regular flyer...huge and hight...the ride is 30 menit long. It's so slow...so we can enjoy the views and if the weather is good we can also see the neighbour country.,,,
,,Replica of the London Eye,3,,Not much views on top.Slow and steady till can fall asleep. you can try for first timer or first time in SG,,,
,,excellent night view,4,,"Highly recommended to visit flyer at night so that you can catch the breathtaking city lights. Its kind of too slow, but thats the beauty of it. Must visit place in Singapore.",,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,We treated ourselves to the Singapore Sling Flyer ride - and enjoyed the absolute luxury of our very own capsule pod all to ourselves - it was a special and luxurious way to enjoy Singapore. We went at night and saw everything lit up including the Gardens by the Bay tall tree colour show. The views are spectacular and the experience was one of the best during our time in Singapore.,,,
,,Singapore at the top,3,,Singapore flyer is one of the famous tourist destination when in the area. Not for those who's afraid of heights. Children would definitely love this.,,,
,,Brilliant,5,,"If you are not afraid of heights, I can highly recommend this slow ride in the sky. Awesome photos to be taken.",,,
,,A great experience to see the sights,4,,"Worth the trip out to the wheel, but allow plenty of time as quite often there could be a queue. In addition it takes about an hour to do one turn.",,,
,,Must visit,4,,"Must visit place in singapore, we got passes from Singapore airlines for this attraction, visit flyer in evening & you'll get excellent views. Don't miss hawker market at the base.",,,
,,Great Place,5,,Its A Great Place To Visit in Singapore Its One Of The World Largest Observatory Wheel In The World Located At 165 Neters Which Takes 28 Minutes To Complete One Round The View From The Fkyer Of Marina Bay Area Is Excellent Overall Excellent Place To Visit,,,
,,Outstanding views...,4,,We took an afternoon flight. The entire round takes around 30 minutes. I enjoyed every bit of it. The views from it were amazing. My kid just loved it. Make sure you go there when the sky is clear to enjoy the views.,,,
,,Great view,5,,Wounderful view over singapore. You see the gardens by the bay all of marina bay the formel 1 trak;) There is a small garden bevor you go on the flyer it s nice to spend there some time.,,,
,,Great view!,5,,"First visit this Singapore flyer. It has a great view! After that, take a little walk and visit Marina Bay Rooftop",,,
,,"Not a must, but...",3,,"This is nothing special but a must if you want to see some attractions. High views of Singapore as can be expected, but the haze prevents truly clear views.",,,
,,What a View,4,,"View from the Singapore flyer is most impressive. Views of ships in the bay, and view of the city where well worth the ride.",,,
,,Birds Eye view of Singapore,5,,"This something you have to experience , more especially after you have done the tour of Singapore. This experience just brings all the pieces of the puzzle together. Entering the facility is on its own is fascinating , there's a beautiful story around the construction of the Singapore flyer and few facts that will make you jaw drop. A must visit site when you are in Singapore.",,,
,,Bird's Eye view,5,,If you wanna see Singapore from the top most height then u must visit Singapore Flyer. 70 Singapore Dollar is the ticket fee as per I can recall. On the spot u can buy. As it needs 30 mins to complete the total rotation so have time in hand .,,,
,,Nighttime view 馃憣馃徎,5,,"For $33 the Singapore Flyer is a must do when visiting. We weren't sure whether to go during the day, or at night, but our driver who took into our hotel suggested we go at night, as the smog can sometimes impede viewing. And was he accurate, during the day it was overcast and smoggy (so we didn't go) but we went at night and the vistas were fantastic! Definetly recommend!",,,
,,Awesome views worth the spend,4,,Great views of Singapore - we had a nice clear day and saw the whole of this great city from a totally different perspective. Overall a very good experience apart from the hard sell of the photos they take and the fact they don't give the soft copies unless you buy the premium photo package.,,,
,,Super views,5,,"After hopping off the hop on bus (you get a discount if you show them you hav e a bus ticket), we were here fairly early in the day so we were lucky to get a cabin with just four other people who were very nice. It takes around 30 minutes to go round once. The views are over Gardens by the Bay, the Marina sands hotel and city skylines of Singapore. On a clear day like we had, you can see for miles. Worthwhile doing.",,,
,,tourist attraction,5,,"watch singapore by day or night , amazing sites , and seeing the cargo ships in the harbour , like a traffic jam on any busy highway.. overlooking the gardens and the city , and singapores formula 1 racing curcuit ... look its just great and a must do",,,
,,wonderful experience for kids as well as adults,4,,"My family had great time at Singapore flyer. The location is well maintained also the flyer is just superb, overall a must visit if you visit Singapore.",,,
,,Amazing views!,5,,"Amazing views. If you're looking for something cool to do in Singapore, come spend a little time here.",,,
,,Great views!,5,,Very much worth a visit. Surprised how quiet it was there. We had the whole pod to ourselves and our small children also enjoyed it.,,,
,,"Best time to visit is when the city lights are on, as you will get the best of Singapore view",4,,"The view from the capsules was very nice
We visited it at around 5-6 pm where the sky is still bright and the view is quite nice
You have one angle where you can see the beautiful sky scraper that is the background of Marina Bay night show, so I'd figure having the ride on 7.15 pm would be the best time to see those city light and get the Garden's by the bay night show that starts at 7.30 pm, if I'm not mistaken

The total rotation time is 30 minute, so that time span you can get good view of those light shows

Before finally entering the capsule, you will see a mini art installation that is nice to take picture and ""play"" with

To get discount, better buy the ticket at Duck Tours as they have a package or a discount. You can buy in the flyer premise itself or their Suntec office where you will get free shuttle ride to the flyer",,,
,,Fantastic view,5,,"If you would like to experience a panoramic view of Singapore, then you must not miss the Singapore Flyer. The Gardens by the Bay, the Harbour etc with its stunning buildings all make up the spectacle. Not to be missed when you visit Singapore",,,
,,Amazing views.,5,,A great place to see the bay from Above and it's gorgeous. Night time is the best time to go in this ride. Enjoyed it thoroughly and it's worth every buck to see Singapore from The flyer,,,
,,It麓s very nice and I recommend visit and look view,4,,"Nice flyer, I think should go visit if stay on Singapore. Wonderful view麓s and looks very nice on evening time. Only it麓s little expensive and even it麓s so nice I think take little too long time when stay on flyer. I visit there with friend and we can stay together, it麓s staff look we are together and only us on cabin.",,,
,,A bit pricey; night views diminished by lights,3,,"Wish I could rate this attraction higher as it is so iconic and a point of tremendous prod here, but I was left feeling that I'd seriously overpaid and had made a mistake by going at night. The ride is $33 SGD but I discovered the next day that one can get better views from even higher up in the immediate area for far less. I can recommend both the SkyPark at Marina Bay Sands ($22) and the LeVeL 33 microbrewery & restaurant as good alternatives.

My biggest issue with the Flyer was that the lights create so much reflection in the glass cars that the views are diminished and ruined most of what should have been good nighttime pictures of the city.

If you go, I'd strongly recommend doing so during the day and going elsewhere for the nighttime views of the city from above.",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,"I highly recommend at least one trip on the Singapore Flyer as it is a very slow moving, air conditioned way of seeing Singapore. Don't forget to show your Singapore Airline ticket for 10% discount.",,,
,,Try Singapore Sling Flight,5,,"Having a Singapore Sling Flight in the moment after sunset may have a most exclusive and impress experience. The view and the cabin was quiet good, just relax and enjoy the view of city and coast. In the moment after sunset, visitors may see the transition from daytime to night view within the 30 minutes, which will be a good choice.",,,
,,Singapore flier,5,,It gives you 360 degree view of Singapore. When you reach at top you see all the high buildings and view is simply superb,,,
,,A birds eye view of Singapore!,5,,"Expensive but worth it for the wonderful views over the beautiful city skyline of Singapore. We did the Singapore Flyer with our two young boys aged 7 and 9 and they absolutely loved it. At night, the Flyer is lit up and looks amazing.",,,
,,Fun Tourist Activity,4,,"Get a stunning view of Singapore from atop the Singapore Flyer!
Unlike the London Eye, there are no lines, no need to purchase a speed pass. Singapore Flyer is set at the base of the Formula 1 race track so you can get the feel of the Formula 1 race when you peer down to ground level.",,,
,,Great viewing,4,,A easy stroll from nearby hotels and the MRT is the iconic Singapore Flyer. 37minutes to make a complete rotation is worth every cent. A must do experience when in Singapore.,,,
,,Great views but over too quick,3,,"Great views and cool inside the pod, If you fly with Singapore airlines I think you may be able to get a discount if you keep your boarding pass.",,,
,,Expensive but worth it,4,,You wanna see the view from the top I think this is a good idea. You can enjoy the beautiful bird's eye view of Singapore. We were lucky when we visited there were just 5 of us in the tube so we can really freely move around and take pictures from different angle. Not really scary though it is made of glass since the floor is not made if glass so it's a relaxing 20-30 minute ride.,,,
,,You get on and you go around,4,,"Yes folks it's a Ferris wheel, where it differs is the, outstanding entry to the wheel. When we were there there were NO crowds, but judging by the long and winding path to get in, it could be like Disneyland on a National Holiday., anyway there is the most entertaing and engaging series of lighting, infograms, audio visual displays etc,etc.on the way to the ride. The big""cylinders"" that you climb into are air conditioned and have comfortable bench seats in the middle. There are spectacular views of most of Singapore - you be the judge of the S$33 ticket",,,
,,A pleasant relaxing way to view the Singapore skyline,4,,"The evening is a good time to ride the Singapore Flyer, a great view and the lights of the city make a good photo opportunity although reflection of the glass could be a problem.",,,
,,one of my favorite attractions in Singapore,5,,"this flyer is perfect for families, couples, and people of all ages, it could be easily accessed and the ticketing process is not hard. it's both amazing in the morning and in the night, but i would recommend it in the morning for those who want to see the natural scenery, and in the night for people who want to observe the modern city and skyline.",,,
,,Must do: must view!!!,5,,Got half an hour to slow down in busy Singapore? Go here! a nice slow ride once around the wheel with a lot of great views. Nice for anyone and everyone and so slow even those in fear of vertigo don't realize the height... Q's can be a pain - be early on a promising blue sky day!,,,
,,THE VIEWS!,4,,"One of the largest ferris wheels in the world and it delivers on giving you a good time filled with amazing views of Singapore city.

The experience was good since the management was good.

The only flaw is the large number of people they allow to enter inside the containers(not sure what else to call them) since I was one of the sad four or five people who couldn't get a seat throughout the whole 30-35 minute experience.",,,
,,Nice View,5,,"you going to singapore flyer around night day, it's most beautiful, really nice view in the night, really romantic if you come with your relation, really amazing.",,,
,,One of the best views of Singapore CBD!,5,,"Aside from the MBS Skypark, riding Singapore Flyer was just a dream. I never thought the view was so stunning when you're personally inside the glass capsule. I have seen images of the view from the Flyer before, but being actually there is more than the fun as compared to staring great shot from inside it by previous riders of the Wheel.

I also recommend trying this out. You'll never regret having done so.",,,
,,Worth the Spin,4,,"Great views
But the mystical trip needs a shortcut - please!
It is a great view of the various parts of the city but the walk to get on needs a shortcut.
No map in the pod so we had to work it out for ourselves.

Worth doing - but no thrills",,,
,,Fantastic Experience!,5,,The views form this 160meter Diameter Ferris wheel are amazing. The ride is about 20mins or so and you sit in a very comfortable cubic with views all around the city and bay area. The attraction has good food facilities and access to transport. A must see in Singapore!,,,
,,Great to see - well - as far as the eye can see!,4,,"Went on this on a lovely clear day, its on the hop-on-hop off bus route, so easy to get to. Not that expensive and you really do get to see as far as the eye can see! I was completely amazed at how busy the shipping lanes were outside! Definitely worth 拢20 for 30 min ride. You can walk around the big bubble pod thingy and get photos with no real problem and when we went there wasn't really a queue, and we hadn't pre-booked or anything. I guess its much like the London Eye really - only in Singapore.",,,
,,A Flyer to See Overview of the City,5,,Like in other cities this flyer will provide you with the view of the city. Located near the Marina Bay area so you have the view both the city and the sea side.,,,
,,wheel in sky,5,,"incredible vistas of 360 degree Singapore. well run , clean . no long queues and no packing people into pods . a great experience for the whole family .",,,
,,Good,5,,Good place to be in Singapore. The views are fantastic as you are able to see Singapore at 360 degree,,,
,,Excellent views,5,,"The flyer was a good experience, the views as you ascend are amazing you get really an idea how large Singapore city is , it's fairly cheap and you can purchase tickets on site. It's a 30 minute round trip, and if you opt for the extras you can also have dinner on the flyer, this is more expensive but another unique experience.
Overall good experience, staff are helpful and friendly. The flyer is a good way to see the major views of Singapore.",,,
,,nice,4,,"you get a full view of singapore. the glass cabins are spacious and many people are in there at a time. not highly recommended , but yes, it is good.",,,
,,Visit,5,,Well worth the visit to see the skyline of Singapore very clean good air conditioner which is a must and is on par with the London eye .,,,
,,Wonderful Views of City,5,,"The""Flyer"" is a modern day Gerri's wheel, but with all the air conditioned comfort and safety in the world. A complete trip takes 30 minutes or so... just right to drink in 360 degree views of Marina Bay and much of the towering city scale as well as the busy harbor. At SGD 33 its more expensive than the nearby ( opposite side of the bay) Marina Sands which offers a better view (56th floor) at lower cost. And you are better able to shorten or lengthen your time! Still it's fun to do and the A/C and enclosed capsules are great when the weather is sweltering!",,,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,"We all really loved this first-class attraction, giving great views of the Singaporean Skyline. Recommendation to visit after sunset for a more impressive view.",,,
,,"Worth it, especially on NYE!",5,,"Very affordable attraction and if you can go at night, even better! Went with a NYE '16 group and it was awesome and such great views of the city.",,,
,,no way less than London Eye,4,,"As good as London Eye, less crowded though. The view is also very nice. Food options are extremely low.",,,
,,Good view but very overpriced,2,,"The views from the Flyer are good, but the same views are available from other cheaper vantage points in the city. My husband and I ended up paying $66 to take a 30 minute trip on the Flyer and were put into a capsule with a family who hogged the window space to takes selfies for the entire time and whose screaming children were jumping all over the place, including on our bags which were placed on the seat. All in all, our view from the Flyer was no better than the view from our hotel room and was inferior to the view from the Skypark of Marina Bay Sands. Don't waste your money.",,,
,,Nice,4,,Similar concept of London Eye. One gets a great view of the city / country landscape. The tickets though I felt were tad expensive.,,,
,,Excellent overview of the city,5,,It takes half an hour to do one rotation on the wheel and costs $33 per person (adult). We skipped all the introductory rooms along the way because we were on a tight time frame. We only had to queue for about 3 minutes before we were in one of the pods. We only had to share it with six other people do no issue moving around and taking photographs. It was a beautiful clear day so got great views. The only issue was reflections off the windows for photos but that is a minor issue. Great attraction.,,,
,,Great views!,5,,Hopped on to take in the spectacular cityscape views. Pretty good value and a memorable experience. The sightseeing bus dropped us straight there so it was nice to hop off and on again after. Would reccomend!,,,
,,Stunning views,5,,The Singapore Flyer gives you stunning 360 degrees views of the island. It's absolutely amazing what they have done to the island and if you have a local or a guide that can explain the past and the future projects to you I'm sure you will be as amazed.,,,
,,Must Do in Singapore,5,,"Its very good to see the city like a bird, very good must try if you are in Singapore I think its world's tallest observation wheel. Ticket price is little bit high.",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,What an experience to view Singapore city from the sky an amazing experience one we will never forget. We are definitely coming back to Singapore city! There is so much to do and see !!!,,,
,,Wonderful,5,,Singapore flyer gives an excellent view of city's skyline. Everything is well managed and super clean. The garden at level 1 with fishes in the pond was the main attraction for our 4 year old daughter.,,,
,,Thunder held us il,4,,"The ride was stopped due to impending thunder. They said they would make an announcement if the ride continued-
Lucky we stayed close as we did not hear an announcement. It's a great view of the city- we went in the evening and got to see the super tree light show from above(7.45 or 8.45)",,,
,,Weary travelers,4,,Don't miss this even if you have little time My time there was a pleasure Staff very accomodating most helpful,,,
,,afternoon offseason for two,4,,This is good for afternoon off season for no waits and possibly your own personal cage with your friend.,,,
,,Worth a visit. But you can see the same from Marina Bay Hotel view point,5,,"We had also been on the viewing platform on the roof of Marina Bay Hotel where the views are similar. When we travelled on the Flyer, there was a thunder storm so it was amazing to watch the sky from the wheel. You probably dont need to do the wheel and the Marina Bay Hotel rooftop. One or the other is fine. Both views not required.",,,
,,Taking Forever to Ride,3,,"We went to Singapore Flyer on the Boxing Day, and it was long queue at the ticket booth. There was only 1 counter opened.
When we just given our tickets, we had to scan our bags but we had to wait to scan as the queue reached the scanning machine. We did not realise that from the scan area, it was forever to ride on the Flyer. While in line, there were only some images and non-working exhibits. There were no seats - so for elderly and young kids it was too much because the queue was moving very slowly.
Only then I knew that out of 28 capsules, 11 were used for private dining/private whatever activities. That made basically only 17 capsules operating for ""other"" passengers. At that time, there were no private events so the 11 capsules were going around empty. I just see such inefficiency resulting in long and slow queue of passengers looking to ride the Flyer ""normally"". Waiting time at that time was about 1.5 hour. You can't exit anyway.. so hungry or tired, you still had to continue queuing.

Once you ride, the view was spectacular though - given good weather and clear sky.",,,
,,Birds view of City,5,,"Flyer is really slow, this not that entertaining but you should go in there if you would like to see the birds view of singapore. Its good to go afternoon, close to sunset so that you will be able to see city in the day light and night. If you book online there is some discount in the entry fee.",,,
,,Good one,3,,2nd largest flyer in world a must place to see in sin gapore better if u go at dawn ticket a bit costly it should have a audio guide unside or an lcd tv telling abt the sights that we see from flyer,,,
,,A must do thing...,5,,We did the London Eye and the Melbourne Star so we just had to do the Flyer. This one was the best by far. Things to see/do whilst queuing and it just seemed a better quality attraction. We got some stunning shots of the city at night. Half the price of the Eye too.,,,
,,good view of the city,3,,"The Flyer gives a good view of the city. I've done it twice now and always during the day. If you are in the area and looking to kill some time, by all means do it. However, there are much better attractions in the area. The view from Marina Bay Sands is as good or better.",,,
,,Excellent views,4,,We went in the morning. Probably the best high up all round views of the city. There were 8 of us per car so not crowded and air conditioned. A peaceful calm ride with brilliant photo opportunities. Probably good to do at night as well but we just didn't have enough time. Well worth it even though expensive. Again not to be missed if visiting Singapore.,,,
,,Great views,5,,This is one of my favourites next to the London eye. First night in Singapore we went on the flyer and had great views across the city. Easy to find and great for pictures. The city lit up at night is magnificent. Wasn't much of a crowd later in the night. Highly recommend.,,,
,,Take an hour to try it,5,,"It is one of those things that you have to while you are here, but it is worth it. around 30 mins to go around, but the view is brilliant",,,
,,Helicopter view of Singapore,5,,"Singapore flyer is one way of having over the top view of Singapore, its shores and skyline. It is a very comfortable 40min ride in a capsule of size of a bus and you can take as many flicks as you can.",,,
,,Fantastic view of the city,5,,We began our ride on the flyer just after 7.30 pm. At 7.45 the gardens by the bay have a light show which was very pretty. It takes half an hour to do the whole loop. Cost was $33. Nearest MRT (rail) is Promenade. Very enjoyable.,,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,A good experience if in Singapore. Good views. Remarkable design. Unique take on Ferris wheel. Take a camera. Stunning. Try and book online so you don't wait. Costs 33 sgd per adult.,,,
,,"Up, Up and Away-Fantastic Views!",5,,"George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. would be very proud of the Singapore Flyer. The 30 minute ride is nothing but incredible. This offers you the best views in the city. Great to do around sunset so you can experience both day and night view. They even offer dinner service with fine dining fare.

But beware of pending lightning storms. They will cancel or postpone rides in bad weather. So if your time is short, do not wait!",,,
,,Very good experience,5,,Visited this place during Christmas. The first day I went it was closed due to bad weather. We decided to buy the ticket before we board the flight. We went back the next day during the day. This place doesn't have long cues. We waited 20min for our turn.,,,
,,What a beautiful view,4,,"Me and my family have been to the singapore flyer many times but this time we were so suprised when we got in it. When we reached the top : ""Wow!"". We saw lights, flowers , and alot of greeneryIt was an amazing sight. It was one of the best sights for me.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,woww this was awesome guys those views are fantastic. My first experience in flyer. You should try this place out once you visit Singapore.,,,
,,Must do in Singapore and truly worth every buck,5,,"Well, this is not such a hyped place of visit like that of Universal Studios, Garden By The Bay, Clarke Quay, etc. So, frankly, we thought it will be an ordinary experience. But, trust me this was really a very memorable activity for tourists in Singapore. Its half hour of the best views anybody could get from anywhere.

The Singapore Flyer is a giant Ferris wheel in Singapore. It flaunts an outstanding view of the Singapore Bay area, Singapore Central Business District and its roads and highways, at a height of about 514 feet. You also get to see parts of the famed F1 street track of the Singapore Grand Prix.

It is a definite must for tourists who want to witness Singapore's wonderful scenic beauty. After all, the ride is only for 30 minutes and is a very relaxing way to perk up your evening. I suggest that the most suitable time to go for the ride is exactly 15 minutes before the sun sets in Singapore so that you are able to see how Singapore's day melts into a starry city night. It is not a fast ride despite the towering height it achieves, but really slow and fascinating for all ages. So a great way to spend some quality time with your family.

The capsules are extremely spacious and are surrounded on all ends by clear glass windows, so you can observe all that's around you effortlessly. There is also an option of having a lovely candlelight dinner in the capsule, but we decided not to speculate that particular aspect of the ride.

Overall, it was a short, but pleasant ride, worth every buck spent.

Tips/info/experience:

1. If you want to reach by bus, then you need to get down at the Temasek Avenue, opposite Ritz Carlton. It is a short walk of 200 meters from the bus stop. In my experience, compared to MRT, if you travel by bus in Singapore you have to end up walking lesser.
2. The formula is very simple. Check for sunset time in Singapore on the net. Land up at the flyer half n hour before. Then see the queue and estimate the time in such a manner that you are going to be starting the ride EXACTLY 15 MINUTES before sunset time. When we went sunset was at 7.04 pm. Trust me you will see magic as day changes to night.
3. You get a lovely view of the bay area and the sea with shimmering ships with lights all across the sea. The Singapore Grand Prix track right under the flyer. The Merlion Plaza. The domes of Gardens By The Bay. The Stadium. The Marina Bay mall. The Esplanade Theatres by the bay. Every way you look is breathtaking.
4. My suggestion is book online through the official website of the Singapore flyer. As per my research, I did not get a dependable vibe on other agent sites. Also, please watch out for combo discount packages. When I booked there was a package for 2 adults + 1 child. Though we were 3 adults + 1 child, I booked 2 adults + 1 child in one package + 1 adult separately. This came out to be cheaper.
5. There is a lovely fish pond at the ground level below the flyer. Here you can feed the fishes. Fish food is available through an automated machine next to the pond.
6. We noticed lots of restaurants and a food court with local food options. Disclaimer - we didn't have food there, so cannot comment on quality.
7. Suntec Mall is just around the corner. Just a couple of bus stands away. You could even walk it there. So, if you finish with the flyer by 8 pm you could go to Suntec Mall and have dinner there. Suntec Mall also has the Esplanade MTR connected in case you would like to use the MTR for transportation.
8. The best part is that the organisers take about 10 people per capsule whereas they could take many more keeping in mind the space available. But, this is what is good. The capsule is not crowded and everybody gets lots of chances to see all the views without any botheration from the others. Kudos to the organisers for maintaining this number.

So, to summarise. We were tourists in Singapore for 6 days and visited many tourist spots. The Singapore Flyer was one of our top 3 experiences. Please do make it, but remember the sunset part!",,,
,,Must so,5,,"Just like the London Eye, this ferris wheel give u a 360 degree bird's eye view of the city. It also claims to be even larger than the one in London. It is located in a very scenic area of the city. It also makes for a great photo op, especially at night.",,,
,,Stunning views,5,,Absolutely fabulous experience! From booking on line everything was well managed. Only queued for 10 mins to get on. Limited numbers on each pod so plenty of time and space for everyone to move around the pod. Magnificent views all the way around. At the bottom excellent selection of very good hawker stalls. Highly recommended.,,,
,,Great,5,,"We like big wheels. Not very busy when we were there. Shared the cabin with only three others. Ride and views were very good. They were setting up for the GP race at that time, the area is a bit of an eyesore and right next to the wheel. There is a tropical garden setting below the wheel, very nice. Worth doing at least once.",,,
,,Nice View of Singapore Marina,4,,"One of the great attraction of Singapore, there are less people at this attraction. We stopped by the Promenade MRT station, walk to the Flyer, as the line was short, entering the flyer was a breeze. The whole circle took 30 minutes and it was nice to ride this again.",,,
,,Singapore view in one ride,5,,Have a full 360 degree of Singapore view in this ride. And yes do not worry it is not scary giat wheel which is to thrill or scare you :),,,
,,Great view of city,3,,Easy to get to. Good way to kill an hour or two (one rotation is 30 minutes but there are shops and restaurants too).,,,
,,Enjoyable views,3,,We ride this but unfortunately got stuck in a carriage with some very inconsiderate people making the whole experience not so enjoyable. Luckily we could get up and walk around the carriage with some really amazing views.,,,
,,Nice view,5,,"This is the best tourist attraction of Singapore, nice view of the city from top of it like Marina bay sands.",,,
,,First Time in Singapore,5,,"On my first trip to Singapore...the Singapore Flyer is one of the Country's iconic attractions.
However, if you are able to access any hotel with a restaurant or bar on the 65+ floor...I feel you will get the same panoramic view and experience as in the Flyer.
Plus, at the restaurant or bar, you can enjoy a nice drink...while in the Flyer, you have to sit and wait for the Flyer to make one full rotation before you can depart.",,,
,,city view,4,,"very nice view of the city center and the bay. started from there, and walked over to the marina bay. recommended as an afternoon activity.",,,
,,Copy of the London eye,4,,"I think its a bit smaller than the London eye. But well maintained, clean. Quite expensive at 30$ a trip. As expected, gives u a good birds eye view.",,,
,,Excellent views,4,,This is a must do to see the city from the top. Discounts are available on Singapore Airlines boarding card,,,
,,very scenic/ unigue an special,4,,At night it is brilliant perhaps almost a must do in Singapore. The views are brilliant you will enjoy it.,,,
,,"Great views, a bit long",4,,"Views from the Singapore Flyer are spectacular. You can see 360 views, with such sights as the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, National Gallery, CBD. However, I found 30 minutes to be a bit too long to look at this, wonderful as it was. I imagine children would get a bit agitated too. Also, 33 dollars seemed a little pricy for the experience. On the whole, very enjoyable nonetheless.",,,
,,Lovely views!,5,,"This attraction is very similar to the London Eye! We were lucky as it was a lovely sunny day so had a clear view over Singapore. Just as we were coming down a thunderstorm broke so the Flyer was put out of action for the duration. Staff were lovely and helpful. A bit expensive, but that's just par for the course in Singapore!! Would recommend!",,,
,,Observatory on Singapore bay from the flyer,5,,The amazing of this flyer is that it goes very slow so that you can really appreciate the view as if it would be a tower observer. It takes half an hour and you can admire several details from the Formula one pit lane to the Marina Bay and all the rest of the city skyline on the bay. Wonderful architectures and fantastic view over an amazing city.,,,
,,Giant Ferris Wheel,4,,This attraction is similar to the Eye in London and the Las Vegas Wheel. It gives you a good view of the Marina and surrounding areas.,,,
,,Great views,4,,In the end this delivers what you would experience etc views that go on for miles and miles. Some interesting things to look at on the way in although find it difficult to get interactive elements to work,,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"This was a fantastic experience, everyone - including children - should experience this. Fantastic views of the city and the ocean, as it was Christmas you could see all the lights. We went up at dusk, so by the time we got to the top - a slow journey - it was dark - beautiful!! Day time would be great too.",,,
,,Great view of Singapore from Singapore Flyer,5,,If you like to get the bird eye view of Singapore then you must take the ride of Singapore Flyer. Overall it's a good experience.,,,
,,Another must visit in Singapore,4,,"If in singapore, this is a must visit. One rotation costs $33 and takes half hour. Worth it for the views. Take the evening time or night time for a better experience. Holiday time can be rush time also. They have some variations like dinner, champagne etc, but the simple tour is best. If staying in Downtown, its a stones throw away.",,,
,,Great views,4,,Great view from this attraction and probably a must do when in Singapore buy if its a toss up between the Flyer or Gardens on the bay then the Gardens wins hands down,,,
,,Bird' eye view of SIngapore,5,,As title suggests one can have bird'eye view of whole Singapore through this flyer. Its a slow moving flyer so that one should not miss any view of the city Singapore. A must visit place if one is going to Singapore. There are many restaurants nearby flyer and one can enjoy eating out there.,,,
,,Enjoyable at dusk,3,,To be honest I thought it was a bit boring mainly because it is a very slow ride. However we went early evening and watching lights come on around the city was great. I would recommend going just before dusk so u see the city in daylight and then the lights,,,
,,Another Tourist Point In Singapore,4,,"Like those in London, Hong Kong and/or Seattle, it is located at the Mariner Bay where tourist can enjoy the city at another angle.",,,
,,Ride to view Singapore from Top,3,,"This Singapore Flyer is just like London Eye. This is not some fun/fancy swing for kids as it seems in photographs. Rather, it is simply an attraction which moves/rotates at very slow speed i.e takes approx 25min to complete one round. People (08 nos or as per rush/preference) are made to sit in airconditioned glass boxes and one can have view of complete singapore city from height. Cost is 33$ per head.

One can go for it, if you wanna have city view in one go.",,,
,,Good experience,5,,"It's a good experience with flyer and i really enjoyed with family . Must carry camera for nice views and selfies click .

Total 28 tubes , u can have private booking also ( a small restaurant feel ) ( extra payment ) else it will handle 28 approx people in one tube.

Enjoy:)",,,
,,Spectacular view,5,,I was here on holiday with my family. The singapore flyer was one of the attractions we had to visit. The flyer is supposed to be the 2nd tallest flyer in the world since a taller flyer( just by small margin) was built in dubai i guess. This flyer has some numerology behind it. It has 28 chambers. In each chamber it can accommodate 28 people. It takes 28 min to complete one round. The flyer never stops ..so getting on the flyer or getting off is to be done while it is still moving..it moves at a slow pace and i felt the getting in and out process was quite safe..although senior citizens on kids may need to catch hands of others while doing so. The view from the flyer is just amazing. From the top u can see a lot of other attractions and the view is really worth it.,,,
,,U can see the beauty of Singapore,5,,"Must ride even u fear from height. Very slow & convenient. This gives an opportunity to see the beauty of Singapore City line, Garden by way, Formula 1 race track and the see.",,,
,,Singapore from 165 meters above,5,,"It indeed is the largest flyer in Asia, towering at 165 meters. It takes 30 min to take the full circle and you may click the skyline of Singapore at your leisure. One can visit either in morning or in the evening, it creates the same magic irrespective.

Some dining options are also available at the flyer. So if you are hungry, just go and grab the bite.",,,
,,"Interesting view, Lax maintenance , greedy customer service.",2,,"This is one of those eye giant ferris wheels...There is a lot to see from the cabin, but be prepared for some not so great customer experiences along the way. When we bought tickets (box office is nowhere near the entrance...) We got this major argument from the ticket person who insisted we pay full price for our 12 year old . They actually wanted an ID like we carry around a passport for purposes of showing her age. Really? Also seniors get NO discount unless they are from Singapore. Seems greedy. Attendants was off putting and rude, which is unusual here. Once on the car, the AC was obviously NOT working. Views were great but comfort was not. Shoddy service. Also kind of expensive at $33. Do not pay more. They also try to sell you green screen photos at highly inflated prices. DO NOT BUY THESE> Take your own photos in the cab.",,,
,,Good Views,5,,I felt its entry tickets are over priced but its one of those must do things in Singapore My parents enjoyed the view and we took some nice pictures for memories,,,
,,"Good views, Air Conditioned Capsule",3,,"I visited the Singapore Flyer with my family during the day.

The capsule was air conditioned which made a comfortable half hour trip.
The views of Singapore are magnificent. I was not sure where many of the landmarks of Singapore were though. It would have been good if there was some information in the capsules regarding the direction of the landmarks. There was some commentary but I couldn't hear it very well.",,,
,,Birdeye,5,,"If you want to see the Singapore city in one go ,then you must try this .

30 min slow ride with glass cockpit and you can see 360 degree .

Harbour ,port , race track , river ,dam , financial hub , gardens by the bay .....the whole city can be seen from this ride .

One can enjoy the dinner or lunch in one of the glass cockpit (though it's not cheap )",,,
,,11am flight,5,,"We headed to the eye around 10. A ten minute walk from suntec city.
The price was $33 each. Not too busy today and were in the capsule by 11. It takes about half hour to go around. Great view from all directions and an odd feeling at the very top.
You can get a Singapore sling for an extra 36 but recommend the long bar at the raffles instead.",,,
,,lovely,5,,beautiful location and awesome city view of Singapore by this mean. love to come here and visit at least once,,,
,,Perfect view of Singapore,5,,"Perfect flyer, amazing view of Singapore, I went there around 5 pm and it was empty, during sunset I observed that it was crowded",,,
,,great view,5,,we loved the Singapore flyer. we were lucky to go during a quiet period. the view was amazing. A definite must do.,,,
,,Seriously boring,3,,Seriously boring. Similar views when travelling on Sheares bridge into the city. Guess it's something to be done once. They really have to make it more exciting.,,,
,,Great views of this city at night,5,,"We visited the Flyer towards the end of our visit to Singapore and Oh My! what a view from the top. We were able to see the city lights and even saw our Crusie Ship moored at the dock!
The Flyer moved very gently and you are able to book a Dinner in one of the cabins too. Below, there is a food court, pond, and plenty of paved areas to wander around in if you wish.",,,
,,Breathtaking view from the top!,4,,I did enjoy the bird's eye view of Singapore from the flyer. Truly worth the price. It's a better scene if you get on in during dusk as you'll get both the day and nice pics. The city view is really breathtaking.,,,
,,Singapore at our feet,5,,"Afternoon thunder storm caused a false start on first attempt, missed sharing a pod with a large tour party! Next morning was perfect just us, so could move around freely watching Singapore bustle below.",,,
,,Stunning views of Singapore from very high up,5,,"This attraction is an interesting way to see Singapore from very high up. The queue can be a bit slow moving, but it is worth it. If heights are problem for you, stay sitting on the bench and it should be OK.",,,
,,an eye to most of singa.,4,,"An eye to see most parts of singapore , specially the sourrounded area. There are gift shops and cafes at the site. U can book for a dinnir inside the eye capsul!",,,
,,View from the Top,5,,"If you're fortunate enough to work on one of the top floors of a downtown Singapore high-rise, you may be used to a spectacular view of this great city. For the rest of us, a trip on the Flyer provides a breathtaking experience. Sure, it's a little pricey but a one-time spin is worth it. My favorite time is at dusk when you can still get a great view into the distance and then watch the city's lights come to life. Don't forget your camera!",,,
,,Unique experience,5,,It was the first landmark we saw on our singapore trip and very aptly. Getting a 360 degrees birds eye view of the city is an experience in itself.,,,
,,Kinda Boring...,3,,"So-so only... the flyer is moving a little bit too slow for me.. but of cos my family enjoyed the view... like totally !!! =) it took about 20-30mins estimated in the cubicle, do visit at Night as that's the Best timing......EVER..... Superb View !!!!",,,
,,A great way to see the city,4,,"The Flyer is a tourist trap, but it's a fun and relaxing way to spend a half hour. The views of the city are great, and it is certainly thrilling to be in a glass tube way up in the sky.",,,
,,Amazing views for all ages,5,,"Been to Singapore couple of times but this time we decided to do the ferris wheel. I booked the tickets online S$33/adult for standard view as they offers dining, drinking, private capsules etc.
getting there with taxi is easy. There are beautiful koi ponds to walk around, food court and restaurants. Or you can go straight up for boarding.
Our group consist of myself and my teenage son, and parents aged 70 and under. It is quite safe as it moves so ever slowly you don't even notice it as long as you not scared of heights. When you feel bit dizzy, it is better to actually stand up and see the view near the window then sitting down.
Best time to go is at twilight. You get to take photos and see the landscape also when the sun about to set that gives a different light. The one round takes about 30min and is well worth it. Would recommend if you haven't done it.",,,
,,Must go,4,,"You must try it and you can see the view of Singapore from above, the landscape was good, you must visit it",,,
,,A great experience even though I had been before,5,,"I had been on the flyer before, so - when visitors wanted to go again - I was wondering if I would enjoy it. I definitely did! We went on a day when there were very few people, so our group (four of us) got an entire capsule by ourselves. The only downside vs. the last time I was on the Flyer: There were no maps inside the capsule to explain the various sites. Fortunately, we know Singapore well enough to explain it to our visitors, but if you didn't know the city, it would have been frustrating.",,,
,,an experience that is a must,5,,"we were met and escorted thru security and seated at the VIP lounge. Ordered our drinks and was then escorted to our capsule. Waiters came in and served our entree. The ferris wheel did one full round and so slow enough for us to take in the view and the ambience of the surroundings. As it slowed the main course was served. The wheel did another full round and we were then escorted to the VIP lounge again for dessert,. Totally perfect evening",,,
,,Romantic and with pride,5,,"Several years ago. After returning to the island Sntvsa went there. Bvd.ahsas a nice sense of pride and of being interesting. Above all stand above the zero point that the entire city was violated.
Hotel Marina Bay Bvd.bd very interesting to see, especially since London is the world's second largest Ferris wheel.",,,
,,Magnificent views,5,,"The flyer is great for getting a perspective of Singapore and in fine weather we had great views over city and harbour, couldn't believe the amount of ships!! Great value!!",,,
,,Sightseeing,3,,"Looking for different viewers of Singapore , a way to look from above the crowds at the skyline . Not for those that don't like heights .",,,
,,Great attraction with breathtaking views,4,,"Absolutely brilliant view from the top the wheel. We did the tour early December and there was no crowds at all. It was a clear, sunny day and the views to the busy port and the city were absolutely spectacular. I would definitely recommend this to couples, families and single visitors of Singapore. One of the top attractions.
The cabins are cooled and tinted, which makes the 30 min trip pleasant and enjoyable.
If they fix the ticket office on the top floor, near the entrance, so visitors don't have to walk extra 600 m to the ground floor to buy a ticket and back to the second floor to enter the wheel, that will make the complete experience ""top nosh"".

Useful TIP: Ff you fly with Singapore Airlines and you keep your boarding pass, you can get 10% discount on the entry ticket only by showing your boarding pass.",,,
,,Nice place to spend got day,4,,Very nice to be on aircon garden and park... advised to go out if it is raining or shining day. Have to be ready to spend money on entrance if not can spend time outside roaming free of charge,,,
,,So cool,4,,This is an amazing attraction to be able to see a lot of Singapore. It takes a little while to go around but that's ok. There is a dining option with this but we didn't take that option as it is an additional fee.,,,
,,Amazing Experience,5,,One of the best ways to explore the skylines of Singapore. I would suggest to go for it at evening to see city lights. Don't forget to take a DSLR with 18-200mm lens. It would give you extraordinary results.,,,
,,Must visit Singpore destination,5,,"So much fun. No lines, not too expensive, fun for the whole family. We went late afternoon and the light was perfect. Nights would be pretty but hard to see things. Lunch option would be nice.",,,
,,A little bit pricey but nice ride,4,,"I takes 30 minutes after some reviews my husband checked it. Capsules are with AC. You are getting to have really good view over there. We went there after lunch, not so many people.",,,
,,average experience,3,,"overpriced, not really worth the money. just another view of Singapore from higher up, not the best thing to do",,,
,,It's cool,3,,Great way to see Singapore and very special..got to go on a clear day though for the best views Pretty efficient and just Rick up and book in,,,
,,One of its kind Experience to see Singapore from height,5,,"We visited Singapore flyer for the first time in June 2016.
It's one of the largest wheel of Asia. You can enjoy view of Singapore from the flyer. It is has bus size compartments which can accommodate 8 people...I would recommend everyone visiting Singapore to experience the Flyer.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Good views of the while city for a modest price, got some really great pictures and also learnt a bit downstairs with a walk though the history or viewing wheels.",,,
,,Excellent view,5,,"The Flyer was an amazing experience for me, as it provided a great view of the heart of Singapore within the comfort of an air conditioned car. The experience is different for every time of the day, and I personally enjoyed the night view most. However, this is just my opinion, and I recommend everyone try at least once during day and once during night.",,,
,,Stunning views of the city at night!!!,5,,"We decided to leave this until the night so we could get a capsule alone and it was very romantic it goes slowly around and you can get some great pictures of the bay and the city. Was definitely worth the walk from mbs, just a shame we couldn't buy any souvenirs as they shut the shop early.",,,
,,great 360 degree view of the city,5,,Singapore Flyer lets you see the whole city. The information posted in the car helped us learn the country's history and people. ON the ground floor they incorporated a garden where guests can relax.,,,
,,Fantastic Views!,5,,"My husband and I went to the Flyer this morning and I must say it was a real treat! We also ended up being in an entire gondola by ourselves as it was just the 2 of us in between 2 large group tours. The trip takes a bit over 30 minutes and is so slow that you have a hard time knowing you are moving. The gondolas also have some seating. The Flyer is set in the midst of restaurants and bars and gift shops. Very nice. A great way to get a good look around Singapore!

Treat yourself!",,,
,,Horrible ride.,1,,"I went a week ago, on a Saturday, with my wife. The flyer was more than half empty.

We were hurriedly ushered into a cabin to be shared by 2 Indian families. One of the families had a horrible brat who likes to kicks and throw tanturms. The parents were really spoiling their brat by being unable to control him.

They too spoil our scenic ride by moving too often, blocking our view of the scenes. Too noisy!

The service staff were horrible. Should be sack.

Not worth AT ALL to go and spend your afternoon. It is a 30+ minute ride but it feels like a day!",,,
,,Quite worthwhile,5,,"I loved the Singapore flyer. The only thing is that it is kind of out of the way. I had to catch a bus. On the flyer you have great views of the Marina Bay Sands, the Harbor and the city overall.",,,
,,Fabulous views of Singapore,5,,Highly recommend. Got some fantastic pictures of Singapore... Fairly priced too considering Singapore is very expensive 33 singapore dollars per person - well worth it!,,,
,,really great view,4,,"I've spent my last birthday here. Although its quite expensive, I still went. The view was extraordinary! As someone who stays or visits Singapore, it is important to at least try to ride the flyer once.",,,
,,Good,5,,Good to see it. When we reach at top view is superb. It moves slowly so no need to worry about anything,,,
,,Must Visit for Panoramic View of Lovely Singapore.. You will Love the ride..,5,,"During the city tour, We visited Flyer and enjoyed the ride and paid around per person SGD 55 (Flyer and Merlion Park river boat ride Combo ticket)
This is not at all scary, group of people, say around 10 to 12 person will be in AC compartment and it moves very slowly, so one round in this flyer will take around 30 to 40 minutes..
DONT MISS IT..
some may find it expensive but its worth going for as the view and photos and experience one will get is amazing.. Check out my photos for more details..",,,
,,"Pricey, but is worth a one time visit",4,,"Never had the intention to visit this place as a local, until relatives from overseas came over and wanted to try it out. The city lights are pretty cool at night, good for taking pictures. Views are the best when your carriage is at the top of the ferris wheel, so there was nothing much to take pictures of on the way up. Best to visit at night, when the weather is cooler and the night lights are up. Probably entertaining for the first time, but I will not pay so much to visit this attraction a second time.",,,
,,Fantastic views,4,,"Not cheap but something we wanted to do during our stopover in Singapore. We had a pod all to ourselves. The 'journey' takes around 30 minutes and the views are awesome over the city, the harbour, the barrage and beyond to the shipping lanes. It's a must do.",,,
,,Awesome,4,,"Worth the visit. Not much queue. Nice way to see the area, specially at night. Although it was a bit pricey.",,,
,,Loved it!,5,,It wasn't high on our to do list but we were given the opportunity. We went both day and night time! A lovely view of the bay both times. Would really recommend it.,,,
,,Wonderful experience,5,,"I've been here a couple of times. Once with parents and siblings and second time with wife. We had a wonderful time. Experience was just magical. I would prefer night time as you would enjoy the lights of Singapore. Singapore flyer is a must visit place in Singapore.
Cheese",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Just the same as all the others i.e. London Eye, with a visitors centre. Going in November meant no queuing, but the restaurants in the outside area were closed but open inside.",,,
,,Good observation point,4,,"Takes 30 min to do one turn and it serves as a unique observation point at the level of some of the tallest skyscrapers (when it gets to it鈥檚 highest point). The cars are as big as a bus and in case there aren鈥檛 many people waiting you can actually take the ride on your own (just your family for example). There are dinner cars as well with tables inside so that鈥檚 another idea how to add a great view to your meal.
Make sure it's not raining while you are up (meaning take the ride in the morning!), otherwise you might not see anything else but the rain :-) Night / sunset ride would also be nice.
We visited the Flyer with iVenture pass so admission was free for us.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,3,,Interesting icon in the heart of the city. Can see the whole skyline. Especially beautiful at night.,,,
,,Romantic night ride,5,,"20th Wedding Anniversary in Singapore. Singapore Flyer night ride was very romantic. Capsule was huge, only us and another couple. Operator had the foresight to note our need for a ""couple experience"". Not a fan of heights, but the ride was slow, smooth, steady and I felt safe. The views were SPECTACULAR. Put this on your Singapore to do list. I think Sky Park in the day, Singapore Flyer at night.",,,
,,Amazing view worth it,4,,I liked the flyer it was nice slow you could see the city and the harbor . Time well spent A bit pricy though,,,
,,Nice view,1,,Nice view. Takes about 30 minutes. Costs about 33 Singapore dollar per person. Great view for top. Few eateries and souvenir shops nearby.,,,
,,Tour,4,,Flyer experience is great. If you are at the top of the flyer then you can enjoy the scenetic beauty of Singapore covering around 45 km of entire Singapore..Really nice experience..,,,
,,Well worth a visit for the views of Singapore,4,,"Slightly bigger copy of the London eye, however the Singapore skyline doesnt really compare to other cities although there are many interesting sights to see. Well worth a visit though.. Good food court on the lower level without outrageous prices which is nice for a tourist venue such as this..",,,
,,Fantastic birds eye view of Singapore.,5,,"If you planning to visit Singapore with your family (This is not for single) Singapore Flyer is must be on your agenda. The location, view, height, service and the thrill all come together. You can enjoy the total view of Singapore, city centre, harbour, marina bay sands, gardens, down town even Malaysian border from the top.",,,
,,Exellent value for money with amazing virews,5,,We were lucky to have a pod to ourselves as it was very quiet when we went. Excellent views of city and harbour.,,,
,,Singapore's version of the London eye,3,,"We went on the Singapore flyer in the evening so had a view of ""Singapore at night"". I would say this is a one off experience and wouldn't recommend if you aren't keen on being squashed into a glass room with strangers.",,,
,,"In most cities now, but worth a once only ride for the view",4,,"Beautiful location, over the harbour, and high Culture end of the city, with many prominent buildings nearby, lit well at night. plenty places to walk, sit, and enjoy this quiet side of the city during the weekdays. Great views, worth booking and planning for.",,,
,,Average experience,3,,"Average experience, especially when the views were block by heavy strong haze. The operator should pre-warn the visitors of a potential let- down.",,,
,,"Totally ""Meh""",1,,Overpriced and totally not worth it. Better views from other locations. What an anticlimax. Not recommended.,,,
,,Must do attraction,5,,"To get the very best view of Singapore it is worth visiting the Singapore flyer. On a clear day the view is spectacular.
There are also shops and restaurants around the base of the flyer. If you have a Singapore Airlines boarding pass you can use it to get a discount on the entrance price.",,,
,,Scenic serenity......,5,,Experience the scenic beauty of Singapore with a comfortable and unhurried ride with the Singapore flyer. Just sheer magic,,,
,,Singapore view with in a flyer,4,,"You can view the whole Singapore when it reaches the top .. the beauty of Singapore is a worth to watch it .. little bit expensive .. 33 dollars for one person .. for 15-20 min ride
.. one time watch ... Just go for it for a unique experience ..",,,
,,Amazing voews,5,,We first arrived to Singapore at night and drove past this on our way to the hotel and it was definitely on our to-do list. This has a beautiful view of Singapore and is a great attraction to-do,,,
,,Boring and Relaxing,3,,"It was quite scenic and panoramic view to see all the skysrapers and stunning buildings for 30 minutes ride but we found it was rather boring experience. Great to relax and do nothing. The entrance fee was rather expensive around $$30 but we got it free under Stopover Singapore Holiday Tour. We went there during morning time, no queue.",,,
,,The Singapore Flyer,5,,"The tour of the Singapore Flyer was simply amazing. Had a lot of fun riding on the wheel which offered great views of the city from high above, towering 165 metres above the sea. This is a must see for all visitors. One can take beautiful photos from various points while experiencing a most wonderful ride in Asia's largest giant observation wheel.",,,
,,Nice experience,4,,"Great views, takes about 30 minutes to complete the circle. Same format as the London Eye. On the yellow and brown hop on hop off routes.",,,
,,A must do...,5,,This was a good experience and takes about 30 minutes to do the circle. Great views and many sights to be seen. I would think an evening tour is even more impressive than daytime. Good experience regardless.,,,
,,Good View in Night,4,,suggest to visit Garden By The Bay & Marina Bay Sands first and then have a nice view from top in evening or after sunset from Singapore Flyer.,,,
,,Awesome View from the Top,5,,"Its a must see Singapore from 180 Mtrs , 360 degree view of singapore, can be enjoyed by people of all ages.",,,
,,Overpriced,2,,"Once enough for life, specially due to the 25USD not worth the experience. Hard seats, no music, hot temp inside the cabin, obliged path thru narrow souvenirs shop. I don't regret, just due to the beautiful person accompanying me......",,,
,,"""Flying High""",4,,"A must to do while holidaying in Singapore. We went around 6.00pm so we got the best of both day & night. The views were amazing. The flyer took around 35mins to go round with spectacular views of the city, marina bay, V8 Race track etc.",,,
,,great view,5,,"The Flyer is very similar to the London Eye . Great views of Singapore and definitely worth the ride .Like the rest of Singapore it is very modern , clean , and efficient",,,
,,NEVER FORGET,5,,this is my first time to try this flyer and feel so excited. we can't bring the drink or food here. i never forget this experience. my ride is at night and it was very beautiful view. the best flyer in the world,,,
,,Awesome,5,,Another of Singapore's famous attractions that you must see as you won't be disappointed. The views are amazing with the best time to visit as the sun is setting.,,,
,,Amazing views of the city,4,,"A friend and I decided to visit the SIngapore Flyer to see what it was like on my last night in Singapore. Whilst a little on the expensive side, the views were absolutely stunning and the wheel gives you a completely different perspective and a great chance for some aerial photos. One to tick off the bucket list and to try, but not sure I would do it again.",,,
,,worth it,5,,"the admission pass of SGD32 maybe expensive for a 30 minutes ride, but its worth it. went there at night time around 8pm, the skyline view of the city and the waters around it is amazing, you can walk around or just sit inside. it's safe and you can't feel that it's moving. great experience.",,,
,,Spectacular View!,5,,"Spectacular 360 degree view when the cabin was at 12 o'clock, including the entire Waterfront Promenade and Marina Bay Sans Hotel. Not crowded in November.",,,
,,Night Ride for City Lights,5,,"My wife and I opted to ride at night and see the Singapore skyline lit up. We had a great ride and loved the views of the skyline, marina and garden by the bay area. Awesome engineered attraction and a must do for anyone visiting Singapore.",,,
,,Excellent,5,,"Great way to see the area and how it has changed and grown. The cabs are clean, we were luck to have one to ourselves.",,,
,,First time here in tallest observation wheel!,5,,"It's very fun inside Singapore Flyer when we move up and down slowly. The ride took about 30 minutes to finish. On the top of Singapore Flyer, I can see Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, and the floating Stadium!",,,
,,Not a must have on visit list for Singapore,3,,The Singapore Flyer definitely gives a spectacular view of city from height but it is overpriced and the slow pace of flyer does not give the chill and excitement that a tourist expects after looking at such a big wheel.,,,
,,Birds Eye View,4,,Certainly the best place to have view of Singapore.!! You will experience the magnificent look a Marina Bay Sands from there,,,
,,"Just another view of Singapore, but from higher up",3,,"This was a little over rated, and a little over priced. Just another view of Singapore, but from higher up.",,,
,,Good View,3,,"It provides a good view of the city and the ride takes 32 minutes and costs you SGD 33. It is ok, not the best thing to do.",,,
,,Unimpressed,2,,I'm not really a big wheel fan but wanted see if it would impress me which it didn't. The views are better from some of the surrounding buildings and make sure you go to the bath room first!,,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Beautiful ride, you will be able to see the city on a perfect view. The location was near to the city.",,,
,,"Amazing views, go at sunset.",4,,You can literally see everything. The view is exceptional and you have tons of time in it. Go around sunset to see daytime on the way up and night on the way down.,,,
,,Overrated but has great views,3,,"The flyer is expensive and extremely overrated. I don't mind missing this. The trip up is interesting but takes so long as the capsules inch upwards. But you get to see the whole cityscape; after while the view is the same and it gets boring after the selfies and pics are done. queues are long so try to get a viator attractions pass that you can redeem over the special counter. If not you will have to stand in line for 20 mins.

If you have to choose between this and others - skip it.",,,
,,Not a must....,3,,"We expected more after reading all the reviews. Dont get me wronge...It is great and the views are great and if you werent in a flyer its nice to go but its a very expensive 30 slow minutes and after being in Singapore a few days we saw the views from different places too. Comming to Singapore you have so much to see and do so if I had to choose again I would skip it. Anyway we went there around 19:00 with the kids (6,9,11) it wasnt scery at all. They liked it but they didnt go crazy for it.",,,
,,Lazy Lamhe,3,,The singapore FLyer gives you a birds eye view of the city...however its a very slow ride and no thrill attached too it...its over priced and can be avoided...not something i would recommend.,,,
,,A must do,5,,"We did the hop on hop off bus tour and stopped at the Flyer terminal so, spur of the moment, decided to do it. My wife is not good with heights, but the wheel moves very slow, there is hardly any sensation of movement. The views are awesome! My wife also really enjoyed the experience.",,,
,,Singapore View,5,,"Singapore Flyer, in simple words 35 minutes of photo shoot with whole Singapore views. Nothing special, same as all flyer available in other cities of the world. Centrally located with eye catching views of Singapore.",,,
,,Nice ride,5,,Beautiful scenery. 360 degree unblocked view. Visited on a sunny day and the flyer is a bit too warm.,,,
,,must visit,5,,"after high roller in las vegas this one is the biggest flyer in the world , we paid 33 sgd for tickets pp and it took 30 min to finish the roll and u can see a great landscape of the city from a height of 165 m",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"I wouldn't miss this attraction, it's a great view and loved every minute of it. We didn't prebook tickets, just bought them at the venue.",,,
,,Nice view,4,,"It is a wonderful way to enjoy beautiful view of the city from above, to take pictures and relax while the wheel cycles. However, the cabins need a bit of care to keep them nicely clean from debris and some dirty around.",,,
,,Another must do in Singapore,5,,All tourists must take a ride on the skywheel or Singapore Eye (like the London Eye). Used to be the highest wheel in the world but is surpassed by Las Vegas. Fantastic views of the city and the waterfront.,,,
,,Awesome experience,5,,"This is a must visit in SG. The flyer moves very slowly and offers mesmerizing view of Singapore city and the harbour. Overall, a great experience.",,,
,,Great landscape,4,,"Actually, this place wasn't in my plan because it's too expensive for a couple of tickets. I visit this place because I had my Singapore pass. I did not expect a lot here because those kinds of flyer are very popular now. The experience was quite good with clear view, big cabin. It's is a must place to see entire the city in the evening.
However, the queue is so long.. you must wait a lot. And it will be closed during rainy day.",,,
,,Must visit in Sg,5,,Must visit site. New experience overall. Wonderful views of the singapore. Our 2 year kid enjoyed a lot.,,,
,,Overpriced and shabby,2,,"At SGD33 per head this isn't good value. The facility is getting shabby and frankly you can see more from the Marina Bay sands hotel. There's not much to say really, it's what you'd expect only pricier.",,,
,,Must See,5,,"A must see on a visit to Singapore,Have been twice and would still go again. Night time veiws of Singapore are just wonderful.A photographer,s delight.",,,
,,Cool view,4,,Great experience. Great night view. At least must try once in a lifetime. Is my first time but definitely Is not my last time. :),,,
,,interesting,4,,Singapore Flyer is one of the interesting feature of the island. One must enjoy it if in Singapore for its all around view.,,,
,,great view onto the city,4,,a great experience to be on one of the biggest fliers! spaceous cabins with panoramic view. smooth Boarding.,,,
,,Good view but a bit over rated,3,,The flyer provides good photo oppurtunity for people. A bit slow though. I would skip the dinner flight for its flight,,,
,,London Eye Minime,3,,"A large, slow moving ferris wheel style transport medium which offers participants unrivalled views of the city, Marina Bay and other sites.

The gondolas are air conditioned and standing room only.

There are dinner packages available - where a fully catered dining experience accompanies the sightseeing.

Its relatively expensive - but that said, it offers a unique viewing perspective over SG",,,
,,Better than the London Eye,5,,"The people who built the Flyer learned from the London Eye and improved the carriages. As one who does not like heights, there was no discomfort or concern at all.

Views are spectacular. If you are making pictures, there is no distortion from the carriage glass. The cycle takes a comfortable 35 minutes once aboard. Allow an hour, including wait time. The queue includes a trip through an exhibit of the Flyer's construction and features.

If you want to splurge, order ahead of time for the white table cloth and wine carriage.",,,
,,A must see in Singapore,5,,Beautiful view of Singapore and the harbor. We went at night and its very pretty with all the lights of the city. You can pay a little more and get the nicer pod and get a drink or champagne with it. We did that and were very happy. You can get great photos and video of your ride. It moves very very slowly. We loved it!,,,
,,Fantastic view,4,,"Easy to access with stroller, just leave it at entrance and staff keeps it safe until exiting. View over Singapore is absolutely fantastic!",,,
,,Must try!,5,,Well don't worry if you are scared of giant wheels or heights. This flyer moves very very smoothly u don't feel motion at all. It was nice experience incredible view. I really enjoyed it!!,,,
,,Must try even if you have phobia of heights,5,,"This wheel doesn't look like moving when you look at it from distance. I have wondered why they have a static wheel but when I came near the flyer I could see it moving, imagine how slowly it should be moving. One day me and my wife were very bored and decided to try this flyer (without interest) . We should say that we would have regretted later if we hadn't tried this flyer. We were so excited and the views were wonderful. We took the ride in the late evening so we had the beautiful view of Singapore filled with lights. I am usually allergic to giant wheel rides but this one will make you feel you are safe inside a room. so even if you have Acrophobia (phobia of heights) you can try this as you would feel extremely safe inside the cage.",,,
,,Amazing experience,4,,This was a fantastic experience and we could see for miles. We only had time to use the pods for the sightseeing experience during the day and wish that we had been in Singapore longer so that we could have booked for the evening meal experience in one of the pods. We were in the pod with 2 ladies and an American guy who was working on the Grand Prix at the time. We had chance to take some fabulous photos of the grand prix track from the pod and the amazing gardens that we didn't get chance to see from the ground. Value for money experience.,,,
,,Awesome experience,5,,Whole singapore can b seen from here.. must go ride but a little expensive. Its a 20min ride. It provide dinner facility too if u r ready to pay extra,,,
,,Flyer Beware,5,,"Because once you've been up for the first time you want to go again and again at different times of the day then the night then sunset when it's raining, when it's not - the view is spectacular and ever changing can't wait to go back again - grandies loved it lots of 'cool' 'wow' and 'mummy mummy mummy' moments.",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,Amazing views of Singapore. Staff very helpful. Takes about half an hour but goes very quickly as the views are amazing.,,,
,,Beautiful View,5,,"I visited Singapore Flyer with my parents during our holiday to Singapore. This was not a part of the package that we had taken from our travel agent, We went there in the afternoon. Taking tickets was very convenient. The wheel takes around 30 mins to complete one round. You get to see all places of Singapore from far. So, if visiting Singapore without any itinerary then one can easily list down the attractions as seen from the Flyer. There are very less good eateries next to it. We had our meal at Subway and grabbed some juice from one of the counters near the ticket counter.",,,
,,ultimate experance,5,,"one of best place to visit in Singapore . one gets the best view of Singapore at night. once you reached the highest point , you feel top of the world.",,,
,,Nice attraction,4,,"Nice Attraction, can be compared & is not less than London Eye. Hopp On - Hop Off bus routes pass through this attraction. Many simple eateries are there on the ground floor.",,,
,,Incredible,5,,We went to Singapore Flyer with 2 kids an 2 teenagers. We did not pre-plan to go there. Our guide asked us if we were interested. At first kids were afraid but the wheel moved slowly so they started to enjoy the ride and the view. The view from there is simply incredible. I think anybody should try this once.,,,
,,Good touristy activity; though pricey,4,,"We booked the flyer tickets through Klook. Though we were hardly getting any discount, the reason we took it was it gave a particular time slot rather than an open ticket like you get on the flyer's website. We wanted to see the sunset from the flyer which was supposed to happen at 6:50pm. We took the 6:30pm slot at Klook. We have always had good experience with tickets booked through klook; but this was disappointing. Looks like klook has tie-up with the duck tour organizers and we had to get our ticket redeemed there. The lady there asked us to come at 6:30pm and stand in line with almost 30 other people (who had booked through them). Much to our irritation, they counted us 4 times (my 6 yr old would have counted faster!). By the time we entered the line to get into the flyer; it was already 7:15pm. From then on, it was a breeze because the queue was very short.

When we pointed earlier that there was hardly any queue at flyer and if it was possible to move us to 6pm slot; the lady at the reception flatly refused. While I understand this has more to do with Ducktours/ Klook service; It was really really frustrating to miss the sunset from the flyer.

Flyer in itself is a unique experience and the view from the top is nice. We got to see Gardens by the bay lights from the top and the view of the Marina Bay Sands was fantastic too..The flyer moves very slowly and hardly gives and impression of you being in a Ferris wheel. There is nothing to be scared off; even for people who are scared of heights. The entire ride takes around 35 min of time.",,,
,,An excellent way to Start Singapore visit,4,,"The flyer provides a bird's eye view of the whole city of Singapore and makes you realize, how a man made city with Engineering marvel attracts tourists more than the Natural beauty. Worth a visit.",,,
,,Well worth the visit,5,,"Fantastic views. Puts city landmarks in perspective when viewed from on high. A little smoggy on our visit but still great views, right our to sea past the barrage.",,,
,,grand stand view of the Marina Bay,5,,"The thirty minute ride in the Singapore Flyer is so smooth you will barely notice it is moving. Yet the scenes in front of you constantly changes to give you a great birds eye view of the coastal features along the Marina Bay. Since it is standing almost directly over the raceway, I can only imagine what a breath taking view it must be to watch the formula one grand prix from the flyer!",,,
,,Fantastic views!,5,,Worth a trip and worth the $$. Fantastic views of the city and beyond. Lovely air conditioned capsules make it even more enjoyable!,,,
,,Hang on tight,5,,As someone afraid of heights I had to be convinced and hung on thighs....but the view was spectacular and the ride is run efficiently and smoothly. This is a must at night!,,,
,,Superb 360 view of Singapore,5,,"Went about an hour before close and they had stopped operations for some time due to lighting. Luckily after only about 5min wait they reopened and with not many people we got a cabin to ourselves. The 'flight' is amazingly smooth, near motionless. The view of the night lights is amazing. Best time to go.",,,
,,The famous flyer,4,,I need to go back here and experience the dining for two. The place is nice especially at night to see the lights. I think It's nice to spend some time with your lover here. Great place but a bit pricey.,,,
,,Excellent if in transit,5,,"Well worth doing the flyer especially if like me in transit at the airport, pre booked on line and went straight through with e ticket. Got to see the skyline and phenomenal views across Singapore. Taxi from airport on 15 mins away and reasonable",,,
,,A view you won't forget,5,,This is a must see place in Singapore. Without this a Singapore trip would be incomplete. The flyer gives you a good amount of time to take in the mesmerizing view of Singapore. This experience is worth millions and there is nothing that you will regret about it.,,,
,,Well worth doing,5,,"I wouldn't normally patron a typical tourist attraction, however, on this occasion I made an exception. The flyer not only provided relief from the relentless humidity in Singapore, it was a great way to get a bird's eye view on the city. The MRT station is just over the way and the site was easy to access. There were very few people visiting on the day I was there. The ride affords an amazing view over Signapore and plenty of photo opportunities. The price was reasonable given the experience. Just stay away from the surrounding eateries, there are far better and less expensive places to eat away from the tourist attractions.",,,
,,Beautiful view at night,5,,Takes 30 mins this attraction. I think anytime where it doesn't rain is the good time to visit. Don't really have to book ticket in advance. Went at night and the lights from the buildings around are quite a view. Doesn't have a good view of marina bay sands but it's just brilliant enough.,,,
,,Beautiful place to visit,5,,"We managed to fly onto this flyer. One thing good, there is a place for prayer. As a Muslim. Beautiful night view. Smooth movement and beautiful nite view of Singapore city",,,
,,The view is great,3,,We arrived there at 10am that we did not need to wait. It is great to overview the whole Gardens By The Bay on the Flyer. The Flyer moves slow and you will have plenty time to take photos. Worth to go and not expensive.,,,
,,Bit expensive but worth it,4,,You can have a good vie from the top and all cabins are air conditioned and very comfortable . Approx 25 mins ride,,,
,,You can't beat the views. It's magical.,5,,If you really want to get a great site of the city it's right here. As go astound slowly you really get some fantastic views you'll want to capture on film. Never as good as the actual ride but you can capture a few m mori s.,,,
,,Excellent view of Singapore,4,,"If you want to spend an hour appreciating the singapore skyline and adjacent sea.. head to the flyer. Choose your co-passengers carefully, few can get loud and noisy inside the cabin.",,,
,,High flying views of the city,5,,Loved the view and the fact the flyer ride lasts 1/2 hour and you do not feel it move. Do this before you travel the city so you get a good look at the entire downtown layout.,,,
,,Biggest Flyer in world,5,,Singapore Flyer is a biggest flyer in world. From flyer you can see whole Singapore view. Its very nice to see it. Must visit it.,,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,"Fabulous, can see for miles in all directions. Highly recommend. Very efficiently run, we did not have to wait to get on. Close to this is the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest so can do all on the same day.",,,
,,Well worth the view.,5,,"Don't miss the Singapore Flyer as the view is great and as it takes plenty of time to complete the journey, it allows heaps of photo opportunities and gives you a nice feel of the city.",,,
,,Nice,4,,"That was my first time trying flyer, it's wonderful, at first it was scary because the flyer is quite high, but later i enjoy it. I can see singapore from all of side.",,,
,,Super view,5,,Worth a visit if you are at Singapore. Visited wit 2 yr kid and surprisingly he enjoyed more!great picture of city with mostly all important tourist spot view.,,,
,,Most fascinating experience,5,,Singapore flyer is must to do in list. Every part of singapore is visible from flyer. Ticket is reasonable and some may have optin of dining up thr by paying extra,,,
,,Nice view up there,3,,The view is great but ticket pretty expensive while it only last for half an hour. It is still nice to try out if you haven't try before. Another alternative is pay to go up MBS skypark and you could spend longer time on the viewing deck.,,,
,,Great View; high price,4,,It is touted as a must see when going to Singapore and to a degree it is. The view is incredible. Walking to the complex you can tell they built it thinking there would be a constant flow of people. As is you can buy your over priced ticket and walk straight on. The trip up and around feels safe and if you have a small group you'll more than likely get your own pod. They don't allow food or drink unless you reserve a special car. All in all it was relaxing and I'm glad I did it; but I Would have liked it more if I could have had a beer to enjoy with my incredible view.,,,
,,A Mesmorising Singapore Activity!,5,,"I love the Singapore Flyer! If you visit Singapore, you have to visit this or you have not finished your holiday/residence in Singapore!",,,
,,Overlook the prosperous Singapore,4,,"I stayed in Singapore for whole July because I took summer courses in the NTU. There were many delicious food and attracted scenic. If you like different culture experience little Indian and Chinatown are both good choices. Sentosa and Universal are famous scenic for entertainment. I think Singapore Flyer has the best sight seen. The Flyer is not long far from the city hall and locates in the coastal new-region. When I arrived the bottle of the Flyer, I was amazed that it was so high. After seeing the introduction I knew the Singapore Flyer was the highest Ferris wheel. I entered the Flyer in the third floor. The carriers were very big and had panoramic glass. There ywere 8 people in my carrier. It run steady. I could see the whole Singapore including Sands and Garden by the lay. In the other direction I could see Malacca and freighters over the sea. The weather was very good so I had a very good experience.",,,
,,Excellent view,4,,"As soon as you reach there, you start to feel the excitement. The full view of the city from the flyer is very beautiful. The flyer is slow but these all glass cabins are a thrill.",,,
,,Beautiful view,4,,"Last year, I travel to Singapore and I look forward to visit beautiful landmark. I walk around the Raffles Avenue, I always can see the Singapore Flyer and I take many photos with it. Before I travel to Singapore, I have done some research about that so I already bought the ticket of Singapore Flyer so that I don't need to buy the ticket when I arrived here. I forgot the price of ticket. The car of the flyer is very big, I go to here with four friends. I boarded the car, and the car was growing up. I can see a lot of buildings and landmarks along with the car is growing up. This is a way for us to watched around Singapore. We also can take photos with these beautiful building inside the car of flyer. Although I forgot the price of ticket but I also think that it has a high price鈥損erformance ratio. I will go here again if I travel to Singapore.",,,
,,Better view than Marina Bay Sands,5,,"GO AT NIGHT! The view of the city is much, much better. The experience itself is very fun as well. I can be a bit afraid of heights, but I managed to overcome it pretty easily for this ride. One ticket will get you one full rotation around the flyer, and I believe it takes about 30 minutes. If you had to choose, I would suggest the Flyer over the Marina Bay Sands Observation Deck.",,,
,,Singapore flyer by night,5,,We went by night. Amazing view of the whole city MARINA BAY ..GARDENS BY THE BAY ..among others. Easily reachable by bus. It moves so slowly that you don't feel the height. Nice experience,,,
,,Had its ups and downs,4,,"Enjoyed my trip on the Singapore flyer. I was in Singapore to watch the F1, couldn't resist a go. An amazing view of the city and the night garden- definitely glad we saved it for after dark as the city truly does come alive and look immense with all it's lighting. On the flip side, it is harder than you may think to get a good pic, there is a lot of glare from the glass capsule, so getting that perfect shot never happens. Also boarding for an older or disabled could be tricky as the wheel doesn't actually stop.",,,
,,Really Beautiful View,5,,Really Really Beautiful View. I can look Singapore's view around. So Romantic. I really have a good time with my husband.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"The entrance has a lengthy walk through a lot of unnecessary corridors but with Lovely friendly staff you notice that fact less! The staff were friendly and even momentarily stopped the flyer to allow my mum with a disability to embark and disembark the flyer without fear of falling or injury! The flyer gives you an air/conditioned unobstructed view of Singapore, Malaysia and across a busy shipping lane to Indonesia on a fine day! Well worth it to take the time to ride the flyer and enjoy the 360 degree views! Best at just before sunset!",,,
,,Great views,4,,"I had some free time and walked over from Marina Bay Sands. The cost is quite high for the ride in my opinion but the view is excellent. I had to wait longer than I would have expected on a day that didn't seem to be particularly busy. I arrived at the ride itself with two members of what turned out to be a larger group. They had me wait while the group boarded the first car. It seems like they skipped every other car and by the time the next car for boarding arrived more people from the group were loaded and I was again asked to wait. Since the cars mob e very slowly I waited an extra 15min while a couple of dozen people went ahead of me. This doesn't seem like much but at more than $30 to ride a big ferris wheel?
It was enjoyable overall but I wouldn't do it again",,,
,,An evening ride on the Singapore flyer,5,,This big wheel claims to be the largest in the world. We chose to ride it during the evening and the views over the city were amazing as the skyscrapers and marina started to light up. The cabins themselves were large with plenty room to sit down and 360 degree views over the city. It's not cheap but well worth it,,,
,,Loved it,5,,We had a wonderful time on the flyer. You get great views of the city. We did it at night we saw all the city lights and looked great. Well worth the money.,,,
,,Amazing,5,,Easy to get to if using the hop on hop off bus - has its own stop. A glass pod holding a max of 12 people takes you on s slow ride showing off the sights of Singapore Seating available in the pod but lots of space to walk around too. Images and descriptions of iconic sights on the windows to help you navigate. A worthwhile activity,,,
,,This is the best we have been on.,5,,"Wow what great views, have been on a lot of flyers but you can't beat the sights from this one, will definetly go on it again.",,,
,,Spectacular...even if you struggle with heights!,5,,"I wasn't overly fussed about going on the Singapore Flyer to be honest but my husband and I decided that we should try it out and I am glad that we did. The views are just stunning from all angles. It gives you a great appreciation for the city and how big it actually is. You have 360 degree views of Singapore and a different perspective that you otherwise wouldn't have seen. It is very strong, sturdy and safe so even if you are worried about heights or safety, once you are on, you will relax very quickly! Well worth a visit....",,,
,,Awesome night view,4,,"Visited late in the evening, no queues, superb views over the city. There was only ourselves and a family of 3 in the capsule so it was easy to move around and take in the views",,,
,,Great Place to see Singapore,5,,"My wife doesn't like heights, but she overcome her fear and we went on the Singapore Flyer. She enjoyed every minute of the 30-minute ride and was extremely pleased that she did it. The view is excellent and it allows you to get a better overall perspective of Singapore. Don鈥檛 miss the opportunity, it is not expensive for getting a great view and experience",,,
,,Sunset trip on flyer,4,,We went on the flyer just before sunset so we got both day and night views highly recommend this as Singapore at sunset is beautiful. The pods are roomy and u feel secure my only compliant is that it continues to move as u get on and off which is ok as it moves slow but is a daunting task.,,,
,,Stunning and safe,5,,"Like everything you find in this country, the Singapore Flyer is run at the highest end of professionalism.

Safe, stunning and exciting, I love this ferris wheel. I have been on many (London and Paris of note), but I have to say that this is the best one yet. The pods are secure and immensely spacious, with no rocking motion at any time. The views are floor to ceiling and truly fabulous in all directions: CBD, Gardens on the Bay, Marina, out to sea.

Definitely one of the highlights of my trip and an absolute must for any tourist in Singapore.",,,
,,Must to see the beauty of Singapore !,4,,"Its like giant wheel but beautifully located. You will get the entire view of Singapore. Preferable time, Evening. Its next to Marina Bay so either go for that or Singapore Flyer.",,,
,,Amazing view,5,,Amazing view great service. Better than the london eye and the experience was great. Loved it soo much.,,,
,,Must do,5,,"It's one of the must do activity in singapore, it's 45 min ride and give complete view of the city, it's number 3 high flyer in the world. it could be a good idea to spend some time in this flyer with your loved ones",,,
,,Worth a visit,4,,Singapore flyer Is worth a visit. They Arrange dinner also in it. Beautiful view of Singapore from flyer.,,,
,,WHEN YOU'RE UPPPPP........,5,,"Can see the whole SG i guess.... :D there are some areas to have fun like 3Dmovie, fun game stalls, some places to get souveniers, and food stalls in this area....the ticket is for one person is very cheap like 30-40SGD. It takes nearly 45mnts to complete a full round... very easy to get there... go try... it's worth it....",,,
,,Stunning views,5,,"Enjoyed this attraction - ticket cost $33. Slow moving wheel, about 30 mins in duration. We went at night and the views were amazing! Massive capsules that are very spacious. Must see experience",,,
,,London eye singapore,5,,If you know London Eye this is the Singapore version. Great view of the city and an amazing experience if you do not have fear of height,,,
,,Passtime,5,,This is my second time go visit the flyer and the first in the night. I did visit several years ago but during day time. It was amazing to see Singapore by night from the highest flyer in the world.,,,
,,Great for kids,5,,We went with a big group of 11 with 3 kids and the kids enjoyed the ride and the view thoroughly. We got some amazing pictures of the view.,,,
,,BIRDS EYE VIEW,5,,Slowly moving air conditioned glass cabins on the giant wheel would show you the entire Singapore and at night it is a feast to the eyes and the camera.,,,
,,Nice views,4,,It's a must when in Singapore. It isn't that expensive and offers really nice views of Singapore city.,,,
,,Excellent 30 minutes,5,,Saw the city by night and enjoyed it. However some of the glass windows were fogged up and obstructed our view.,,,
,,Nice view high up,4,,"Nice night view of Singapore from high up. Probably best to go around the time of the light show at 8pm. You have the option to dine in the cable car which is really cool, but quite expensive.",,,
,,nice panorama,3,,"quite expensive...1min for 1 dollar. its a 30min ride. i cant deny u will never regret viewing singapore city, from the busy city view to the garden view and lastly the busy anchorage of singapore port which is also popular of illegal bunkering activity. powerful aircon if u were to ride in hot daylight of singapore. nice lightings if u were to ride at night.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,Must have in singapore visit. Feels amazing when it reaches on its top. All cabins are air conditioned and doesn't feel it is moving. Highly recommended.,,,
,,Great view,5,,A little pricey at $24 each but well worth it. It wasn't busy so we had the whole cab for the four of us. They have a map on board which shows what you are looking at. It takes a half hour to do a cicuit. Washrooms and food are available at the base.,,,
,,Good for a different perspective,3,,"I enjoyed the Flyer, without it being spectacular. Its a nice way to get a different view of the city, was interesting to see the number of ships waiting to be loaded/unloaded, and I also enjoyed watching the rain storm approach and engulf us. THe ride takes about 30 minutes, which is plenty of time to wander around looking out in all directions.",,,
,,Must Place to Visit,5,,"This is the place to be, to get the best view of Singapore! Beautiful views during the day,Lovely skyline of Singapore. Quite slow pace to enjoy beauty. This is a must visit place on your visit to Singapore. Enjoy the fabulous view of the city.",,,
,,Great Flyer,5,,"I really enjoyed this flyer experience

We did it at night and the city shone, amazing to see the lights and sights

Not sure it would be as spectacular during the day but if thats your only option and you only have a short stay the save the legs and see it all from the flyer",,,
,,Different view of the city,4,,"Located at the edge of the sea, this flyer is based on the London Eye concept. The cabins can hold 28 people at a time and move really slowly so you can enjoy the views of the city. Anytime is a good time to visit and you can appreciate the lovely sights of the city. For convenience of passengers, the cabins are marked with the views which are visible from each side.
Definitely worth the money you spend.",,,
,,High Flyer,5,,"We recently went on the Singapore Flyer even though I'm not really good with heights, but figured it's a must do. It was a really different experience and although a little scary because of being so high, I felt safe at all times as the carriages are large with central seating if you don't want to get too close to the glass walls. It definitely gives a view of the harbour and the gardens by the bay and city you would never get to see otherwise and worth the $66 for two. We didn't do a tour, we just went there, bought tickets and boarded. It was a fairly easy walk from the Merlion Park all along the river. We walked back to the Quays, but could have jumped on a bum boat and got a one way ticket if we wanted to, that would have cost about $8. I didn't realise you can hop on a boat at any of the many ticket stations along the river.",,,
,,Almost unobstructed views,4,,"Similar to the London Eye, the Singapore Flyer is in a great location and only it's own structure blocks spectacular views of Singapore. We took a night ""flight"" which was a great way to take in Singpaore in one go. The downside being the internal reflections marred some photo opportunities.",,,
,,You need to go,5,,"A must do while in Singapore, I recommend to ride it at night but it is probably just as amazing during the day. Also for couples, you can enjoy dinner, you will do two turns in the ferris wheel.",,,
,,Great view of the city,5,,At first I thought it was over priced. 33 Singapore dollar. But it was worth it. You got a whopping 33 min up there. 365 degree view. Amazing.,,,
,,must try,5,,"its bit costly, but ride is very good. must visit after sunset to see that night life of singapore. you will also find restaurants at the bottom but food is not that good. please do not try anything other than flyer at that location, its waste of time and money.",,,
,,Really nice and different view than from most other spots,4,,The Singapore flyer offers a distinct special view of the Singapore Marina Bay. The only drawback is that it is relatively expensive for this short ride.,,,
,,Scintillating View,4,,"A not so Easily Commutable Place, unless you are using a Tourist bus. But Worth all the pain you take to reach there. Good View of the Harbor and marina Bay Sands. Worth 90 Mins you spend over there.",,,
,,amazing view over the city,5,,"We visited the flyer at night. The drive was awesome, specially the drive at the highest point. The lights of the skyscraper are magic. If you flight with Singapore Airlines you will get a discount of 10%.",,,
,,Nice Experience,4,,Amazing Experience at Singapore Flyer. On 125 Meters Height you fill amazing Experience the City of Lion. Amazing Experience. Must See Place,,,
,,Reluctant to do this ... but really enjoyed it!!!,4,,I'm not a big fan of super touristy stuff but wanted to give this a try. The Flyer manages big numbers but is very well organised and efficient. The views were incredible. Absolutely no need to worry about being high or wobbling or feeling insecure....More,,,
,,"Great views, not so great price",3,,"The views are great aboard the Singapore Flyer but I'm not impressed with the ticket pricing. In fact, it kinds of put people off. The foodcourt located there provides some local cuisine but the opposite shopping mall has better options.",,,
,,Flying High,4,,Great way to get a perspective of the Marina Bay area while relaxing in air-conditioned comfort on a humid Singapore day,,,
,,Spectacular views,5,,"Book in advance as it can be very busy. Clean and efficient, pods are not crowded and the trip lasts about 30 mins.",,,
,,Great view of the ever expanding easy side of Singapore,4,,Must visit this and well worth the money. Gives you a very good perspective of the ongoing expansion of Singapore and is at the Singapore Grand Prix circuit.,,,
,,Nice views of the Harbour,4,,Relatively cheap and provided the visibility is good you can get great views of the harbour. The Singapore Flyer provides a nice view of the surrounding area. At present it is a little out of the way unless you're using the tourist bus.,,,
,,Limited view,3,,"Although the Flayer is big and easy to access but the view is limited because of its position. Despite being close to the Marina Bay Sands resort, the building is viewed from a side that doesn't show the unique three connected buildings, and that's unfortunate....More",,,
,,MUST VISIT,5,,A good to see all city view. Really a good experience to see from top.A good experience to sit there and move slowly .,,,
,,Fantastic City Views,5,,"Taken high up in a giant Ferris wheel, you will see Singapore from a whole different perspective. And the spectacular city lights are incredible.
You enter into a glass enclosed the moving cabin that can take up to 10 people comfortably. Once in sit back, stand up or better still move around so you can capture the views from every angle and marvel in the tremendous light show.
The price of the ticket @ $33 may seem steep but the ternative is not to go. And that's just wouldn't be a good choice.",,,
,,Flying high in the Singapore Flyer,4,,The Singapore Flyer is a great way to see the city from a unique point of view. At its peak I think they said it was the highest ferris wheel in the world but don't quote me. I know it held a record for something. If you go during the day and on a clear day you can see all of Singapore and Malaysia. If you go at night you get a different experience. This place also allows you to have dinner in one of the pods which I could imagine would be a very unique experience.,,,
,,As good as the London Eye,5,,Great way to see the city with little time to spare. Superb views of the docks and all around the city.,,,
,,Lovely view of all attractions..,4,,"It is a ferris wheel, takes about 30 to 35 minutes to complete one circle and offers you the best view of all Singapore attractions.

We went there late afternoon, when natural light was still good and the neon lights were off. The view of the harbour is stunning. So is the case with gardens by the bay and the Marina Bay sands hotel.

Overall, should not be missed.",,,
,,good experience but not if you are staying i a high rise hotel in the vicinity,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is very well organised (like most things in Singapore !). The half hour ride offers a great view of this part of Singapore by night . However, when we got back to our hotel (The Mandarin Oriental), we had the same view while looking out of the window and did not need a ticket !

They offer a four course dinner on board, but the price and the not so enthusiastic online reviews made us skip the experience.",,,
,,A brilliant half hour,5,,It has a short information gallery and is the world's highest wheel at 165m. It allows for great Ariel views of the city,,,
,,Average considering other available options for a view.,3,,"I was never fond of visiting this flyer but due to interest of other people with me, I landed into it. Its a slow moving flyer which gives you a view of Singapore. I would better pay for the same view from Marina Bay Sands instead.",,,
,,Good views,5,,"Much better than the marina bay skypark so if your only going to do one then do the flyer.
Good views, nice little pond and garden in the complex and a food court where you can get a cheap meal afterwards.
I suggest visiting here first then walk over to the Marina Bay area.",,,
,,Cool Scenaries from the top,4,,"We can see excellent views includes skyline of Singapore and many more. This may be scary for those who hate height, but this is a must visit place.",,,
,,"Nice, but it's just a Ferris Wheel 馃帯",4,,"The ticketing was well organised and the attraction was clean. The views or Singapore were great, but not much different than if you went up to the Skygarden at Marina Sands.
One gripe I do have, and it is common to all the major attractions we visited in Singapore, is the price of the souvenir photos. I'm sure if they were much better price they would sell many more. $40-50 for a photo is a rip off, as I said, it was everywhere we visited.",,,
,,Birds eye view,5,,We went on the flyer at night. The city was alive with lights. We watched the light show at gardens by the bay and marine sands bay. Rotation takes about 30mins. No queues. Would recommend .,,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,"Enjoy this scenic ride that affords majestic views of Singapore! Similar to the London Eye but the cabins are larger,",,,
,,Singapore Flyer liike the London Eye is worth a visit for a first time visitor.,5,,"Went on the Singapore Flyer with friends & family and it was quite enjoyable. Do it if you have the time since it takes a good 15-20 minutes apart from taking the tickets.
The flyer gives you a 360 degree view over Singapore skyline and you can have a panoramic view of the city . they also offer special ocassion visits with F & B arrangements as well. Specially recommended for Honeymooners and young couples.",,,
,,"Love the view, not too bad",4,,"You could see the skyline of Singapore pretty well, be it daylight or night time. The capsule is pretty big too but make sure you do not need the washroom during the ride.",,,
,,"""Flying Visit""",5,,"As part of a short break where we were trying to fit as much as possible in.

We got to the flyer at about 1:30pm on a Wednesday, it cost us S$59, we got a discount because we were using Singapore Airlines. This is comparable to the London Eye so we're happy with it.

We had a bright sunny day with good visibility, no queues so the staff were letting groups have their own capsules.

About a 30 minute trip to complete the circle with fantastic views, I have never seen so many ships before.

Would recommend this as a must do when in Singapore",,,
,,Quiet time with someone special dreaming high,5,,I had visited Singapore flyer many times when I used to work for an online travel company. But it's my first time going there with my companion and really experienced the quietness and the freedom high up there just chatting and having fun. It was very romantic no doubt it was day time but the feelings of seeing almost the aerial view of Singapore was awesome. Even with that few minutes we felt like it's hours. Nice view. Maybe could have been a little longer would be perfect.,,,
,,Evening flight on the weel,5,,"Was getting the champagne flight on a evening with no Skye's and a pod to enjoy it in, beautiful view of the skyline and all the ship's close to the harbor",,,
,,Fantastic views at night,5,,"Amazing views across Singapore and the bay. Went for the F1, views over the circuit fantastic. Nicely air conditioned. Well worth it.",,,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,"My partner and I did the Singapore flyer together and got absolutely amazing photos! The staff were friendly and helpful and we even got a gondola to ourselves! Very easy to get to on the MRT, highly recommended for anyone visiting Singapore especially if it's your first time visiting Singapore",,,
,,"Nice, but expensive.",3,,"A good, one time experience. We went in the evening, and views of Gardens by the Bay and other sights was worth the money and effort. Tip - avoid the hawker market at the base. Overpriced and rude, racist behavior towards non-Chinese/non-Caucasians.",,,
,,Excellent place to enjoy a beautiful view of a wonderful town,5,,"I am afraid of heights but I did enjoyed the experience.It takes 30 min for full rotation. View of Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay, Merlion, National Stadium.
It's a unique experience and my suggestion is to visit before sunset.I did the same when I took the river boat trip.Singapore overall is an amazing place.",,,
,,beautiful view of singapore,4,,Amazing view of Marina Bay and Garden by the Bay. One can get the beautiful scenic view of Singapore from here.,,,
,,Great Night for Dinner,5,,"Had the full butler Dinner service at 7:30 pm. 6 of us had the Western meals, which were fantastic - 4 courses included. The night views are superb fro the top. The dinner goes for 2 revolutions - around 1hr. Drinks are ordered and payed for before you alight the Flyer. It costs around A$170 per person plus drinks. Coffee and water is provided free. I would recommend this to anyone. A once in a lifetime night.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer - A Great Experience - After London Eye,5,,"Having visited London Eye, I had expected little difference in this Ride. To my surprise, this Ride was much more joyful, with definitely faster entry to the car. Much smoother ride. Sights from the Flyer, and ambience nearby were really Refreshing. Will do it again !!",,,
,,Good views of the city,4,,"Most people here have already mentioned about everything that needs to be said However, the key aspect is to visit this just before sunset when you go up and when the light come up, while when you come down you get to see a well lit Singapore city. It's not a great or must visit attraction especially if you have been to fliers in other cities and also because there are many other good vantage points for the views in Singapore itself. The flier itself moves slowly and hence you hardly notice the motion and the entire ride is completed in about 40 minutes",,,
,,spectacular,4,,The Singapore flyer has now become a landmark of the city after the Merlion. It offers a spectacular view of the waterfront and on a clear day also allows you to see the islands of Indonesia and Malaysia. The slow moving wheel takes about 30 minutes to complete a cycle.,,,
,,Just try it,3,,It is so slow that we enjoy the pretty view at night.But tried once in a lifetime is enough for me...,,,
,,Awesome view of the city,5,,"Very touristy, but a must try if you want a wonderful vantage point over the city. We took the parents and they were amazed at the views both east and west. A non-stop picture event!",,,
,,so Dramatic at night,5,,You will see Singapore lit up at night. THe view is amazing and breathtaking. It takes about 30 minutes to finish 1 cycle. It is so slow that u can sit and enjoy the beautiful view at night.,,,
,,Love it,5,,"I always wanted to see SG from above. And Singapore flyer really gave me what I was looking for.

My friend and me booked the ticket online. We planned to see the sunset from the flyer. But, alas, at the exact time we wanted to pass the ticket check in, we were told to get it printed at the ticket box on the ground floor. We didn't want to miss the sunset moment so we rushed to the ticket box and returned back to the entrance. Quite tiring.

However, it was really worth the view. It was so awesome. The flyer takes around 30 minutes for one round. What a great experience.",,,
,,Scared of Heights but Totallly Worth it!!,5,,"While I am scared of heights, and wasn't sure I would actually get in the capsule, I figured YOLO! The pods are air conditioned, and the staff allow separate groups their own pods. My friend and I loved the views, while nervous about the heights, it was amazing to see Singapore spread out below us. I have no doubt that this was worth it!",,,
,,It was okay,3,,"Do it at sunset.. Then you'll get some great pictures. However, I only did it, because I had some spare time and didn't want to stay at the hostel.. It is a great view and you'll see a lot during the ride.",,,
,,Dont miss this while at Singapore,5,,The flyer is one of the best things that I liked among the attractions at Singapore. It gives a good view of the entire city on a slow moving wheel. The wheel cabin is enclosed and has air conditioning making your experience even more pleasurable.,,,
,,Flyer,5,,Flyer is the Most important attraction in Singapore. You can see panoramic view of whole Singapore on flyer ride.,,,
,,Gives a great view of the city,4,,"We've ridden similar structures in other cities so we knew what to expect. The base of the Flyer is located in a very lovel park atmosphere, but the ride itself does not stand out. The view is great, but you can also have a great view from the Ce La Vi restaurant.",,,
,,Must do...,4,,Decided to go at night glad I did view was excellent looking over the bay & gardens. Easy to get to and only a short walk from shops and restaurants.,,,
,,"Expensive, but worth it!",5,,"Breathtaking view all over the city, impressive colours and skyline, friendly staff who did not put as much visitors together in a cabin. Must do if you are in Singapore.",,,
,,Great views,5,,A brilliant place to start your time in Singapore. The views give you a great overview of the landscape of the city. It really helped me appreciate the impressiveness of Singapore's buildings. The ride last about 30 minutes.,,,
,,A great way to see the vibrant city of Singapore,4,,"A great way to see the vibrant city of Singapore. Stunning views and the ride is in no way rushed, allowing plenty of time to take in the views and get plenty of shots. Personally, sunset and early evening offer the most breathtaking views, however, am sure the day is equally interesting.",,,
,,It's a very slow wheel,2,,Don't mean to disparage but its kinda boring and too expensive. If you are a tourists in Singapore and don't have much mobility then maybe think about it but if you are young fit and healthy - there are so many other things to do,,,
,,The Singapore Flyer,3,,"I visited this twice last year and both times with overseas visitors. Is it a must do? I would say no because in the day it was rather hot and in the night though cooler and the view is full of pretty lights, it is too dark to see far beyond. Go if you like heights and have the time!",,,
,,"Yes, it is a must do in Singapore.",4,,"Great views of the city. We really enjoyed the experience. We did this at night, a great time to take the ride. Great for young children.",,,
,,Good views from the top,4,,"Worlds largest Ferris wheel, at the top of the Flyer you get some beautiful views of the harbour, neighbouring Gardens by the Bay, Marina Sands, and downtown Singapore. Takes roughly 30 minutes to do one full revolution. Before the ride, you also go through an interactive history of the flyer, how/when it was built, etc.",,,
,,Worth a visit,5,,Just went there a few days ago and it was very enjoyable. Don't let taxi drivers put you off saying it's to warm. All capsules are air conditioned and we had the whole thing to ourselves. Can't bring up cans of any kind but yet you can buy them when you get up there. Great views and all in all good value for Singapore standards.,,,
,,High and mighty!,5,,Well I wasn't expecting this to be so good. Views of Singapore from the flyer are stunning and show you why the British wanted to colonies this natural harbour. Fantastic sky line.,,,
,,A must do when you're in Singapore,5,,"Nice views and special experience, just something to do when visiting Singapore. We really enjoyed our ride at sunset time when colours of the sky are amazing...",,,
,,One of the best view of the City,5,,A 360 degrees view of the city. Not for the faint hearted. Excellent location. Make sure to be careful when alighting the flier.,,,
,,Holliday,5,,The flyer is a must do better than London eye the price is good also when you get off go just a few yards and get on boat station for boat to clarks kay fantastic,,,
,,Not for those scared of heights,5,,30 minute trip with amazing views of Singapore skyline as well as the busy cargo port. Felt very secure even though it is very high. the wheel moves very slowly so you do not realise you are moving. pleasant experience,,,
,,great view,5,,"The bigest observation ferris wheal. Similar to London Eye. You may use it to the celebratin different fests (wedding, birthday..)",,,
,,Amazing <3,5,,"We were in Singapore in July. When we got at the Flyer, we didn麓t have to stand in line and wait, but we could get into the flyer right away. What a view! If you ever go to Singapore, you have to go here! You will not regret it!",,,
,,A picturesque slow glide,4,,I love the ride as it gave me a good view about Botanical Garden across the river. There's a subway fastfood to fill your hunger and a small souvenir shop to buy your loved one's back home some presents.,,,
,,Very spectacular view from it during sunset,5,,"This ride is really worth doing. The view over the city and over the ships isbeautiful, especially at sunset.",,,
,,Views for miles,5,,Around $33 for a 30 minute circuit on the wheel - well worth it. Higher than the London Eye and on a good day can see for miles and miles. Beautiful at might to see the light show at Gardens by the Bay. Smooth slow ride.,,,
,,Lovely 30 mins,5,,We jumped on the flyer yesterday afternoon and were happy to have our very own pod. The views are wonderful of course. I have done the flyer at night as well and would have to say during the day is better.,,,
,,All Singapore in your view,5,,"Hugh wheel and mass view for whole of Singapore , well maintain and perfect location .. Night view is perfect time to visit the giant wheel...",,,
,,Get experience of one of world's largest flyer,5,,Singapore flyer is must to visit point in Singapore. Its a big wheel which has capsule shaped cabins for seating and standing. From this giant wheel you can get view of entire Singapore. The wheel moves slowly and takes roughly 30 minutes to complete its rotation.,,,
,,Must Do - London Eye view much better though..,5,,If you are in Singapore you must have this in your check list. Choose the time before twilight - that ways you get to see the view in daylight as well as the the lit up city lights!,,,
,,Fantastic views over Singapore,4,,"Giant ferris wheel with enclosed airconditioned capsules (maybe around 2m X 4m). The views are really good. The trip is 30min, but there is also an area before the ride with displays on the construction of the flyer & a Koi pond near where you exit the ride, so it will take a little longer. The ride was very smooth and stable, so motion sickness would not be an issue.

TIP: We went on a Tuesday morning and it was very quiet - we had a capsule to ourselves!",,,
,,A Must-See Attraction in Singapore,5,,"As I've lived in Singapore for nearly four years, I have been on here about fifteen times. Whenever, a family member visits, I take them here, as this is a must-see attraction in Singapore. Quite expensive, but worth it, as it has an amazing view, especially at the top. Any weather is fine, but when it is Sunny, it makes the view even better. I last visited in September 2016.",,,
,,Singapore Birdseye,5,,Its a great experience to see apart of the Singapore city from birds-eye view. Its really a great experience to ride the worlds largest flyer.,,,
,,Sight seeing,5,,"A must see attractions, a smaller eye of London with a stunning view. It offers a great opportunity for pictures.",,,
,,Wonderful views,5,,The cabins are spacious and comfortable with 366 degree views. The full rotation time passes very quickly. it is possible to see over to adjoining countries. An excellent tourist attraction.,,,
,,Fun trip and great views!,5,,"Great views of Singapore from the flyer. A little pricey ticket, but worth it. Enjoyed all sides of the flight!",,,
,,Great views,4,,"We enjoyed this attraction for what it is - a half hour birds eye opportunity to get some great views over Central Singapore and a bit wider. We went later in the day, no queues and straight on. Worth the $33 admission with discount if you flew in on Singapore Airlines (or a partner?) and can show your boarding pass.",,,
,,What a view!,5,,"The Flyer gives an Incredible view over Singapore and this is a must do in Singapore! The view encompasses all of downtown, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands complex, the boats in the harbour. It takes about 30 minutes and in the lovely air conditioning is a great respite from the Singaporean heat.",,,
,,Autmn Getaway,5,,This is a very good way to get a great view of Singapore. There were no queues and the price was very good.,,,
,,Superb!,5,,"This is a must visit place if you are in Singapore on vacation. It's gives a 360 paranomic view of the city and ocean. One of the popular tourist attraction Marina Bay is also just across this Ferris wheel. It is the second tallest Ferris wheel of the world with 28 capsules and each capsule can sit up to 28 people. I visited on a week day, may be a reason why I had only one other family in the capsule with me. The capsules are air conditioned and has comfortable sitting arrangements. It's a great experience all in all.",,,
,,Nice view!,5,,It's my first time to try the Singapore flyer and it was really amazing. The view of the whole city is astonishing. Everyone should try it.,,,
,,A head for hights,4,,A ride well worth taking the views are spectacular your given a plan of Singapore that points out the points of interest,,,
,,F1,5,,"The Singapore Flyer was incorporated into our F1 ticket price, great views from the flyer of the circuit and also Marina Bay area. We were lucky enough to get a pod to ourselves, great air conditioning within pod and also seating area to look at the view. Would recommend.",,,
,,Beautiful views,5,,Must see if you are in Singapore - spectacular views! Price I think was 30SGD which was a good price,,,
,,Over shadowed now by the MBS,4,,"The biggest shame is that ""it's thunder"" has been stolen by the MBS hotel. People would come here for the views but now they go to MBS. However. if you have never been on a flyer before we recommend this trip. The best bit is when the pod goes over the top and you turn on the outside, from an engineering point of view absolutely brilliant. You do not feel any movement. Nice garden area underneath as well. Never any queues anymore.",,,
,,A Good Touristy Adventure.,4,,"The entrance to the Flyer is quite some distance from Public Transport stations, yet not for people of average fitness, the going being flat. There is again quite some distance after ticket purchase to the actual boarding. Once at the boarding point, the assistants are well versed in their task, and safety is paramount. The ride takes approx 30 minutes, and climbs to some 165 metres, giving tremendous views of the surrounding areas including the Harbour, the Financial Business District and all points North through to the East. I didn't think it was cheap, costing nearly $30 on a concession fare. There is the inevitable 'gift shop' on the exit route, with, what I thought, were quite expensive items. Probably one of the ""must dos"" when visiting Singapore!",,,
,,Sensational,5,,"Superb views of the city, gardens etc. We were lucky to go in a quiet time so had a cabin all to ourselves. Well worth the money.",,,
,,up up and away!,5,,absolutely wonderful. there is plenty of room in the cabins to move around and see all the sights. tru;y magic!!,,,
,,Need to be experienced once,4,,"Well, the subject line advices something else, but I have been there thrice now. First one was a solo travel, second one was an hour (two rounds) couples candle light dinner and the third time it was a New Year party at one of the banquet located adjacent to the place. Good for sight seeing whether it's day or night. Couples dinner is good for non-vegetarian. Veg options for my Wife were not too impressive. For the Nee years eve, it is a good place for watching the midnight fire works. In all worth going.",,,
,,Good views from the top,4,,"Saw amazing views from the top of the flyer, it costed us $33 each. The entire journey takes around 30 mins, the flyer is very slow and people get in and out of the box while flyer is still running. The tubes are air conditioned and one can see garden by the bay from the top.",,,
,,"Pricey, but spectacular view",4,,"At SGD $33.00 for an adult I must admit I had second thoughts about doing a loop in the Singapore Flyer. While I'm still a bit grumpy about having to part with such a high admission fee, there's no doubt the view is truly spectacular.",,,
,,Holiday,5,,This is truly a magnificent experience. Wonderful views 360 degrees of Singapore. Gives the visitor a true perspective of the layout of Singapore. The pod you go into moves very slowly for being able to view and take great photos of everything up high. Tourists must not miss out on this fabulous experience.,,,
,,Awesome experience,5,,"Singapore flyer is worth visit. In the ground floor before getting into flyer there are few boards and stalls which will give all information about flyer and its construction process. The views from the flyer are awesome. Good to visit during sunset time, So that we can get a chance to see perfect beauty of singapore.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,"This a very exciting way to see all of Singapore from this big wheel, located in the Maria Bay Area.
The ride on the wheel takes approximately 30 minutes. You get the best view of Singapore and a great way to take photos of Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands hotel",,,
,,Take this ride for a wonderful view of the city.,5,,Take this ride for a wonderful view of the city. we took the ride late in the afternoon due to constraints of time. However if you can plan the ride in late evening/ night it would more better.,,,
,,Reach for the sky馃挮馃寵猸愶笍,5,,"One of the best wheel experiences I've been one. Fantastic views 360 of the Marina Bay., Singapore skyline, famous Marina Sands hotel, financial district and more. Sorry London, it beats your experience! When you enter make sure you purchase your ticket first on the ground floor level then take the escalator up to the entrance where you receive a friendly welcome, usual photograph sell but you can skip this if prefer to take your own and then you walk through an interesting area of how the flyer was built - great to know some facts and also fun for kids or if long queues. We went early evening, one of the best times to go as not busy and the sunset views are amazing, then the lights appear on all the buildings, really great. It rained at the start but added to the excitement with lightening flashes! Since the ride is 30 minutes plenty of time for photos and the weather to clear. Fair price and a worthwhile experience.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"Excellent Wheel and tourist spot. We used the Hop-On Hop-Off bus which delivers you to the door. Easy access and great views from the Singapore Flyer. One suggestion is to visit early in the day, as we had our own compartment and no crowds. But the time we had finished, there were many people queued up waiting for their ride.",,,
,,Singapore looks different,5,,"Singapore Flyer was always a must visit when we were living in Singapore for any of guests visited us and one of the main reason was both my wife, Ranjana, and I loves hopping on the Flyer every time. View of Singapore is different and looks beautiful specially with Sun setting and lights starting coming up.",,,
,,Great attraction,4,,Great attraction but totally deserted. This is good as there were no queues but surely they cannot last much longer with the total lack of visitors. Maybe reducing the price would solve the problem,,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"We caught the Hop On Hop Off bus to this. Very helpful attendants re getting on and off. The slow motion allowed perfect views of the Kallang River, Benjamin Sheares Brudge, Sports Hub, Marina Bay Floating Platform and especially the Gardens By The Bay. Very safe and highly recommend this for a overview iof the city.",,,
,,Wow,5,,"We recently enjoyed a ride on this fantastic Ferris wheel. Luckily it wasn't too busy and we shared a pod with just one other couple. The flyer affords magnificent views of Singapore, including the FOrmula 1 track. Well worth a visit. Staff are well organised and everything goes smoothly. The wheel itself is a great feat of engineering in itself, a thing of beauty, more so when lit up at night. A must do when visiting Singapore. We recommend going during daylight when you can see the whole of Singapore and pick out the highlights. Lovely grounds with tropical garden and fish ponds with plenty of koi fish. Quite a few eateries in the vicinity too. Only a short walk away from the Helix bridge.",,,
,,"Great View, one time experience",4,,"the location is very good, not much crowded, ticket price is reasonable, I had a very nice view of the city. very peaceful and relaxing, good half hour spend, try this in the evening and have a look of enjoy the amazing view of the marina, Garden by the bay, the buildings and surroundings.",,,
,,The end of a long walk,5,,"So we have been a few times to Singapore and always passed on the Flyer, but at the end of walking 17km we decided it would make a good break.

On a good day the views are fantastic in all directions. If you have flown with Singapore Airlines you even get a discount with your boarding pass.

A good way to pass some time off your feet",,,
,,Amazing...but it should be!,5,,"Fantastic wheel in an awesome location....great views of eg the marina Bay, F1 track, far open port, etc. Been on a few of these from London to Orlando. 8 people on our ""ride"" so not issue getting great photos. Surprised that these was no running commentary to point out places of note. 拢23 a fair price and the air con was very welcome. Wonderful sunny day so unrestricted views.",,,
,,Good views. Not my favourite,3,,"If you like slow moving Ferris wheels this is great you. Good views of the city. Personally, I'd prefer to go up to the top Marina Bay Sands and have a beer while looking at the view.",,,
,,Can visit only once!,3,,Singapore Flyer is just OK. In my opinion it does not offer a view as good as expected and is OK to visit only once.,,,
,,Absolutely Fantastic,5,,"This was our first time to Singapore so we headed straight for the Flyer. it was already dark by the time we got there so we got to see all of Singapore lit up, I was absolutely blown away, the flyer itself was terrific, the pods you travel in are wonderful, you get a terrific view and I cant speak highly enough of it. absolutely work every cent of the price.
I am happy to recommend the Flyer to everyone",,,
,,Great thing to do while in Singapore,5,,"this was beautiful and you can see it from everywhere you go in Singapore, it was a site to see. I enjoyed it very much!",,,
,,Singapore Flyer (Take it or not?),3,,"Taking this 30鈥?ride gives you wonderful views of parts of Singapore and is worthwhile, but not the 鈥榤ust鈥?to do. I was there on a Saturday (around 11AM), there were no lines at all. There were at most 150 people. Everything very efficiently organised.
Tip: If you booked a 鈥楽ingapore Stopover鈥? and want to get in with your free ticket 鈥?do not go to the main ticket office, but go just around the corner (it鈥檚 not well indicated) 鈥?and have your passport, SIA booking print-out available 鈥?the plastic card you picked-up at the airport is not enough. They are not very fussy, as long you have one other thing as well.
On the negative side: the only places where one could have lunch or even just an ice-cream, looked dilapidated and surely in need of modernisation.
All in all, yes, do it 鈥?but it鈥檚 not the end of the world, if you miss it.",,,
,,360 degree view,5,,Circle takes about 30 minutes and you can see 360 degree of the city and Formula 1 circuit below. It moves slowly and you can sit in the middle or stand and take the view in. Definitely recommend.,,,
,,A bit expensive but still a nice experience,4,,"The cost is quite high for a flyer but the view to my mind definitely worth it, been there at night and seeing all the lights from up high was quite a view",,,
,,Worth the price of admission,4,,Get a fantastic view of Singapore from way up high. See an almost perfect city with every detail. A great place to be at dusk. See the hundreds of ships ready to unload there cargo as long it is not too dark. A must see if possible!!!,,,
,,Alright,3,,"Nothing new in this now. After London, everyone seems to be copying and getting this. Ride took 30 minutes. Wasn't crowded so only 4 people were there in the pod. Good views of entire Singapore.",,,
,,Awesome view of the city,4,,"I live in Singapore and I recommend a tour on the flyer ! It's not cheap but it offer a very nice view of the city . Location is quite central and to me was a good experience , I brought also my mother which was very happy . Experience for all ages . Enjoy !",,,
,,Sky High View,5,,one circle will take 30 minutes during which you can enjoy entire Singapore view from all the sides.its the world's highest flyer moves very slow and even you dont know its moving. Great experience,,,
,,Great views from up!,5,,"I recommend this place because you can see 360 degrees of the city, the skyline, the bay, formula 1 circuit, etc.",,,
,,Beautiful view!!!,5,,"We visited here with our son. It was at night and we were exhausted. We had already purchased our tickets online, and there was a little crowd so there was no delay to get boarded. The view was spectacular and our toddler enjoyed it too. It was quite relaxing for us as we were exhausted. Enjoyed it a lot.",,,
,,Great city view.,5,,"Lovely ride. Peaceful 30 minutes. Must go, has a little gift shop. I really enjoyed it, hubby with vertigo still enjoyed it.",,,
,,flying high,4,,"Worth the effort. Not busy when we went at 730pm. Straight on & only 8 people in our pod. Lots of interesting sights from height, formula 1 track & floating football pitch to name a few. Get 10% off if you have a singapore or silkair plane ticket. The photos they take with you against 6 back drops expensive. 2 in a binder frame will set you back $50......",,,
,,A really good view,5,,The rain was just clearing when we went up and we had a car to ourselves. The ride was very smooth and lasted 35 minutes which made it better value than other famous wheels that we have been on. It is ideally sited for the best views of the city.,,,
,,A great view,3,,It is great view from the top of the Flyer and the wait was not very long. While it is a little pricey it's not over priced for that type of attraction. Worth a visit if you have time and are looking for something touristy to do.,,,
,,Who doesn't like Ferris wheels?,5,,"I'm a scared of heights but know I must push myself to experience them or I miss out on seeing awesome views, so I swallowed my fears and went on the flyer at sunset....What a treat, although cloudy the sky showed lovely colours through the clouds and I could see for miles. A must do!",,,
,,Amazing view,5,,We went on the Singapore Flyer on a very good weather day and could see so far! It was a spectacular view and the staff at the flyer were helpful!,,,
,,Great view of the city,4,,You feel on top of the world during this 30 minute ride. We went Tuesday afternoon and had a car to ourselves.,,,
,,Best view of the city,5,,It is one of the best attraction of Singapore. Try this attraction in the evening as you see all the lighting of the city.,,,
,,Over-rated and over-priced,2,,"The Singapore Flyer is an extremely dull ride, and at $33 per adult it is grossly over-priced. It is a contrived beat-up of an attraction, not worth bothering with. Five minutes into our half-hour ride we realised what a waste of time and money it was. Avoid it!",,,
,,Amazing view,5,,"Came here as it is one of the highlights in Singapore. Once you are in, relax and enjoy the amazing view of the marina, the bay, the buildings and surroundings.",,,
,,Stunning views!,5,,"Wow! I only wish this ride could have lasted a bit longer! It was so enjoyable and the capsules allowed 360 degree access so the views were amazing! I must admit though that I nearly had to elbow some other passengers out of the way as they were intent on getting their perfect ""selfies"" the whole way round, but luckily there are not too many passengers allowed in at one time. I will do it again next time . There are some lovely eating places downstairs too.",,,
,,Can't believe my brother got me on this!,4,,"It's so smooth -- you barely know you're moving -- thank goodness! I don't love heights but I enjoyed the views this offered of Singapore, the bay, and other attractions. We didn't have any wait time.",,,
,,beautiful view up there,5,,went there with a few friends at night and it was totally great. The view is so beautiful at night and the skyline is just amazing.,,,
,,Fantastic views of singapore,5,,"Very well organised, efficient and clean. 30 mins on the 2nd largest wheel in the world. Before boarding you get a good display of how it was constructed and how it works and a size comparison chart to all the other wheels of the world.",,,
,,Spectacular views!,5,,"We visited the Flyer while on a recent family holiday to Singapore and we all loved it, the cabins that you ride in have loads of room and the layout ensures that you virtually have 360 degree views in any direction. The location of the Flyer ensures excellent views of the Marina Bay area, the CBD and also the harbour area among other things. The duration of the ride is adequate also, we visited the Flyer during the late afternoon and as it was a beautifully clear day, there was a little bit of glare through the viewing windows in the direction of the sun, but this had no bearing on the quality of the ride. Strollers or prams were not permitted on the ride, these are required to be left at a marshalling area prior to boarding, therefore those riding with young children might want to be mindful of this. Overall an excellent experience",,,
,,Great city views,5,,"Around the world, wheels are wheels are wheels but they do provide a unique view of a city and worth the ride. The Singapore flyer provides an awesome view of the bay, the amazing number of ships anchored, the gardens, marina bay sands and city. Worth the ride.",,,
,,Brit couple travelling..! A must do attraction,4,,"If, like we are, first time in Singapore, it's a must do thing.. $60 Singapore dollars, (approx) the view is amazing & a slow rotation of the city, (approx 45mins but don't quote me.!)
It's apparently the highest in Asia, but the London EYE takes some beating..
did it, would do it again as it's no good standing there & saying I wish we had done that..
Taxi back to hotel reasonable from below the flyer as is great food cheap from the hawker stalls, whom are really friendly..
鉂わ笍",,,
,,View!,5,,Best flyer experience in the world. Far better than London eye. You can see the whole city when you are at the top. Almost as tall as Marina bay sands . Nice experience. Not got bored. Great view. Click as many pictures as you want and enjoy!,,,
,,Great views,5,,Great views of the city for approximately $33 dollars. You can also pay extra and have drinks as well. A must for all travellers who aren't afraid of heights.,,,
,,Like Singapore - it doesn't stop,4,,The walk from Marina Bay along the waterfront to the Flyer was well worthwhile as was the Flyer. Terrific views of the skyline of Singapore. A short walk up the road is the famous Raffles for high tea.,,,
,,Flying high,4,,"Really enjoyed seeing Singapore from this fabulous vantage point in the sky great view of the racetrack, saw more places we wanted to visit, it was like looking at a 3D map.",,,
,,Around We Go,4,,What a wonderful way to see the lights of Singapore. We did the ride at night and were amazed at the distance we could see especially the blinking lights from the hundreds of ships moored of Singapore,,,
,,good view to view most of the city,4,,"A good place to view most of the city, it takes around 30mnts to complete a circle. i request to take combo pack of flyer + merlion park to save some dollars.",,,
,,What a view,5,,"Tourist or a local - you should do it at least once.

The hardest decision you have to make is:-

Do you want to see Singapore by daylight, dusk, or dark?

Once you work that out the rest is easy.

Turn up, pay, and make your way up to the boarding area. The Flyer does not stop so the 'pod' keeps moving while it empties and you then board. The 'pod' holds about 20 people but it was reasobably quiet when we went so there were only about 8 or 10 of us in ours. It is air-conditioned.

The glass does have a green tint which seems more noticable in some peoples' daytime photos but not as noticable in the night photos but I'm no expert. I'm happy with my photos.

If it's raining, put it off if you can as obviously you can't see as far.

Other than that - it simply comes back to whether you want a day or night view of this amazing city.",,,
,,Amazing skyline view of Singapore,5,,Very friendly staffs. Amazing skyline view of singapore. Better to visit in the evening around 6pm so that you could see the sunset.,,,
,,A must for someone visiting Singapore - Night Time though is better,5,,"This I guess was built on lines of the 'London Eye'. We took this late in the evening - around 8 pm. It offered great views of the city lights and overall the ambiance inside the capsule was great. The kids specially had lots of Oh & Ah moments with the sights.
In case you are taking this in the evening, would recommend a walk down to 'Makan Sutra' for dinner - A Food Lovers delight",,,
,,"Good experience, But slightly expensive",5,,"U can get a complete view of singapore, awesome experience, but the cost is slightly higher, we had to pay 50 dollars for both the flyer and the boat ride.",,,
,,A casual experience,3,,"It offers great view, amazing seats and very less waiting time. Had an amazing experience overall. Must visit or can alternate visit the marina sand bay hotel terrace walk.",,,
,,Great view!,4,,"I never thought much of big city ferris wheel, but this was a great experience. The view was quite spectacular. We were lucky that we went during the quiet time, just before the sunset crowd comes in, and so we have the whole capsule to ourselves. Compare to London eye where weather is a hit and miss and you always have other visitors in your pictures or try to elbow your way to get the right angle.. this is a far better experience. Expensive though.. I would think twice before I go again given the price!",,,
,,Much much more than just a ferris wheel with a view,5,,You could easily spend an hour or more at the complex learning about Singapore and the history and building of the flyer. The rotation takes around 1/2hr and gives very impressive views of the city. We were there 6 years ago and the changes are amazing. Afterwards you can have delicious authentic cuisine in a 'replica' old time market under the complex.,,,
,,A wonderful experience but a bit costly,4,,"The Singapore flyer gives you an half an hour ride of the flyer to enjoy the wonderful sights of Singapore. You can enjoy great views of the Marina Bay, the Merlion park, and other great buildings from the closed chambers of the flyer. The flyer also has options for dinner, i.e. you can enjoy your dinner in the flyer while enjoying the wonderful sights of Singapore.",,,
,,Great views... make sure you go on a clear day!,4,,"This is a must see tourist traction in Singapore. The views are fantastic, just make sure you go on a clear day or there's really no point.

Each gondola has a great air conditioning and plenty of room to stand up and walk around.

My kids loved it.",,,
,,Great Attraction.,4,,The entry tickets are bit expensive but you get spectacular views overlooking the city and marina bay. i will recommend the night as the views of all the lights.,,,
,,Magnificent view at the night-time,5,,"I recommend to try out ferris wheel when it is dark outside. City lights are magnificent, and you can enjoy ""Gardens by the bay"" light show from above.",,,
,,see the city of singapore,5,,must do if your in singapore. Gives you view of the entire city. Fun 40 odd minutes. We enjoyed this activity whilst visiting Gardens by the Bay. Kids enjoyed the views also.,,,
,,Enjoyed the view,4,,"We enjoyed the experience as we had not been on any ""flyer/eye"" in any city. We did it by day and thought it was good. The other advantage is once you do it here you don't need to queue in other cities as for mine, done it once why bother somewhere else. We were lucky we didn't really have to queue here unlike London where it would have taken much longer to do this activity. The other option is that you could just go on ""flyers"" around the world, as there seems to be a lot of them.",,,
,,Giant Wheel for Birds Eye view,4,,"The wheel is a long walk from the MRT or bus station.Be prepared for long walk unless you are arriving by a vehicle. Impressive view of the skyscrapers. The birds eye view of the Marina Barrage, Gardens by The Bay and the river emptying into the sea is worth a mention.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,3,,"Great place to get a birds eye view of the singapore city.Since its an iconic architectural aceivement you should visit,but definetely skip it the next time if I visit Singapore",,,
,,Fly by Night :),4,,"Great way to view Singapore's gorgeous harbour. We did this at night which was stunning. Was expensive as we have four children - and the night process for ticket purchase and finding our way was a bit clunky, but the views were unforgettable!",,,
,,Great City Views,4,,"We went in the late afternoon and didn't have to wait at all. We heard that the attraction can be crowded later, usually around sunset because people like to see the lights at the nearby Gardens. However, the views from the flyer were still beautiful, and it was a great way to get an overview of the different parts of the city. The ride took about 30 minutes, which was just the right amount of time. There is also the possibility to have dinner on the flyer. In that case, they allow you to ride around twice.",,,
,,Great views of the city - get some great pics!,5,,"For a decent price, you can ride the flyer and get some incredible views of the city! You can also do dinners and parties on the flyer! It goes slow enough I never felt sick or queasy! Really fun!",,,
,,Nice experience,5,,"Nice experience great view its located in a excellent point for the best view of the city, marina bay and garden by the bay can be seen from the the up.",,,
,,Boring To The Max,2,,"This is meant to be the Singapore equivalent of the London Eye.

It is a unique way to see the southern part of Singapore, but frankly speaking the novelty wears off after 10 minutes or so.

By all means, ride the Flyer if it is part of a package deal.

And once you have ridden it, there is little reason to ride it a second time.",,,
,,Great Outlook,4,,"Fantastic opportunity to see the city of Singapore from such a great vantage point. Downside was the green tint windows, photos not too good.",,,
,,Very well located,5,,The flyer is excellently located overlooking the famous Singapore skyline. The speed is slow but good to spend cool few minutes. It is better to take the ride in the evening with lights on.,,,
,,Amazing!!,5,,"I went there because my friend recommend night view. So, We went there around 9pm. We could see almost everything from this flyer!! Marina Baysans, Buildings, Ocean. I love it!!",,,
,,Awesome chance for timelapse,4,,"Spectacular views overlooking the city and marina bay, the slow revolving flyer offers the chance to capture a time lapse video which will make a great addition to holiday memories for the future.",,,
,,Wanna Fly,5,,"This attraction is a must for those want to have a good view over Singapore from given angle. The wheel spins around and the carriage your sit and it rotates on its' own axel, giving you views of Singapore skyline. Worth one time visit.",,,
,,"Good View, Good Servie",5,,"This has a nice view. Visit there during the morning on a rainy day, Still the ride was good. The only thing I didn't like was they took picture of you and charge SGD 25 for it which I feel too expensive, You can leave it if you don't like.",,,
,,"Excellent views, easy to access",5,,"We went up on a Friday afternoon just after 6 pm. The place was not very crowded, getting admission tickets (SGD 33 per adult) and getting on to the wheel took all of 5 mins. Super efficient as are most things in this city. The wheel takes about 30 minutes to go around, and gives you excellent views of the whole city and the marina area in particular, with the marina bay sands and surrounding skyline providing a terrific backdrop. Dusk (6:30 - 7:00 pm) may be a better time to go up so that one can get both the light and dark views, but what we saw was nice enough.

There are a few places to eat at the location itself, and of course a short walk takes you to the promenade, and across the helix bridge to the sands hotel and the shoppes (a large shopping mall), so plenty to do in the area. You could also choose to dine on the flyer itself for a fairly hefty price, but that was not quite for us.

Overall, certainly worth it for a visitor to Singapore.",,,
,,Flyer is slow,5,,I Love it's big but I like it even more when it's faster. The view is very nice at the night time. Ticket is quite okay but not worth it.,,,
,,Amazing view,5,,This place is located on the third floor along with other things like flight simulators and other entertainment stuff..7-11 on the ground floor and very close the the mariner ...champagne car...Mo毛t chandon car was well worth the slight extra cost,,,
,,A must do attraction,5,,"We walked to the Singapore Flyer and decided tickets to board were a must. The pods you travel up in are really big. Each one can hold a lot of people. The all round viewing is great. They move so slowly that the views are magical. A great way to look over the river, city and other local attractions. Very safe and enjoyable.",,,
,,Expensive ride,4,,"The Flyer is similar to the London Eye but expensive, however there are no queues to board the Flyer. A big capsule that travels slowly offering fantastic views of the city",,,
,,Good views,3,,We enjoyed this experience but its quite expensive for how long your on it. I would recommend Marina Bay at the top for breathtaking views of Singapore,,,
,,Good experience,5,,"The tickets are pricey, but it was a good experience for us. Do not go for this if you are a restless person. You'll get an amazing view of the city, but you won't be able to do anything else. I think there is a dining car as well, where you can have your meal sky-high.
Tip: Go in the evening just before it gets dark, you'll get both day and night views in one go.",,,
,,Visit at night,5,,Nice way to spend an evening in Singapore: good views of the city. Not cheap. They have an option to have a drink inside. Less than one hour to do the tour.,,,
,,Good view from top,4,,It runs very slowly. you would not feel if you are going up or down. The city view from Flyer is really amazing. The entry tickets are bit costly. But its worth if visiting for the first time. Best would be to take the ride in the evening when whole city lit up.,,,
,,should visit,4,,good place to cover whole singapore at one place. good sights to capture on camera. definitely an enjoyable and worth spending place,,,
,,beautiful,3,,"when i went to singapore the flyer was not working, but is still a beautiful place to see around. You can go by train...",,,
,,Fly High at 165 Meters,4,,"Singapore Flyer is basically a giant Ferris Wheel. The Flyer has an overall height of 165 metres or 541 feet. The views from Singapore Flyer are phenomenal, The best time to go is around sunset time so you can enjoy the views in the light and dark too.

--A drop of ink may make a million think.
Pawan Manghnani",,,
,,Too expensive,3,,"We were surprised by the excesive prices : 100$ for a family of 4. The view is nice, but it is really slow and the small exhibition before the so-called ""flight"" is poor quality. We had almost the same view from the hotel. I wish there was some ""guided"" option where you could chose to listen to some facts about the city instead of music during the round.",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"on a clear day the views from the Flyer are fabulous. The city buildings, harbour, Gardens By The Bay domes and Marina Sands, simply breathtaking, well worth the $S33 25-30min ride",,,
,,A highlight of Singapore,5,,We decided to do this as an introduction to the city and it is a fantastic way to get the feel of the place. The views were amazing. We did not have to wait more than 10 minutes and it was not too overcrowded. Highly recommend this experience.,,,
,,Good Viewpoint for Singapore,4,,"This huge wheel is130 metres high and boasts that it is the largest in the world. The ride takes about an hour and gives excellent views of the Singapore River, Gardens by the Bay and nearby areas.",,,
,,Great views of the city and the F1 track,5,,"I went up the flyer during the Singapore GP about an hour before the race started. The views were great, in particular as it was sunset. The ride lasted longer than expected taking over half an hour for a complete journey.",,,
,,Flying High,5,,I would recommend doing this at night. The view is amazing. I'm not sure of the cost as this was a part of the F1 package we had. At 7:30pm you get a great view of the Gardens by the Bay light show. The is the best view point for that.,,,
,,family,4,,1 of Singapore's landmark. nice day and night view. its a good experience. you can see the city view.,,,
,,Stunning!,5,,"A gorgeous meal enjoyed with friends in one of the capsules. 5 star service, even the chef came on board after our first rotation to see how we were enjoying the food/experience. The views from the Flyer are so spectacular, you'd be crazy not to try this.",,,
,,Very good,4,,"Very good place to take a look around the city, especially at night. New experience, new joy. Wish the cheaper price.",,,
,,Aerial view of Singapore.,4,,"It takes aroung 20 mins to complete one round. Important landmarks can be seen freon the top. Cloud dome, flower dome, esplanade, super tree, helix bridge, museum etc are visible from top.",,,
,,Amazing views!!!,5,,"Worth a visit! My sister bought us a ""champagne flight"" as a present and what a spectacular present it was. Sipping on Mo毛t whilst rotating 360 degree views over a beautiful city. Would recommend to all. This is a must do whilst in Singapore!",,,
,,Night time views,4,,Went up during night and was very pleased with the view. Although i haven't been up during the day i would recommend the night as the views of all the lights were great.,,,
,,Great Attraction.,5,,This was a great experience with spectacular views over the city and waterways. It was reasonably priced and waiting time in the queue was short when we visited (mid morning). Worth the effort.,,,
,,Amazing views,4,,"Wow Wow Wow, the views from this are amazing at night, it was over before we knew it which was a shame( but my wife wasn't complaining as she doesn't like heights), definitely worth doing this if you are in Singapore",,,
,,Amazing Views!,5,,We joined a tour and it included a ride on the Singapore Flyer. The ride on the flyer took about 30 minutes. Very slow so you can fully enjoy the views. I really enjoyed it and I think it would be better to ride this at night. We rode it during the afternoon.,,,
,,Breath taking views of the city,5,,Well worth the $33 to get some great pictures of the city. Pods are very clean and spacious so you get 360 degree views in the 30 minute ride,,,
,,Prefect,5,,"A must visit, for tourists to Singapore. Offers spectacular views of Singapore, especially at night. Best time to visit is just before it gets dark, so you can see the city's skyline in both light and dark. The night views are awesome.",,,
,,Must go place,4,,"Nice place, clean, we get whole city view, but its little bit costly...bit one time is must..big spacious capsules...",,,
,,good experiance,5,,It was good experience flying in the must go once if possible to view Singapore and prefer to go 7 to 9pm time,,,
,,Excellent views of the city skyline,5,,The trip takes 30 minutes to complete and gives a good view of the city skyline. We were then when it was quiet but it obviously gets very busy. Good to take a day time and a night time trip or get there at dusk to save money. 23 Singapore dollars per adult,,,
,,Great views,5,,A wonderful relaxing view of the city and surrounds. The kids will love being in these spacious air conditioned capsules too.If you are scared of heights you can still enjoy it all as it takes away the scariness!,,,
,,See Singapore in every direction,5,,We had a pod for 28 people and there were only 4 of us in it. A brilliant way to see the whole of Singapore in half an hour.,,,
,,30 minutes of breathtaking views from the top,5,,It's worth a visit if you love to take breathtaking photos from an unusual angle - the top of the world!,,,
,,Superb Attraction,5,,Most certainly worth a visit whilst in Singapore. The views are amazing all the way round. Highly recommended. You will not be disapointed.,,,
,,Nice view!,3,,Nice view to see the Singapore downtown and Marina bay area. The ticket was purchased via Klook. One couple was with us during the trip and my family of 3. The day ride is 30 mins and is beautiful.,,,
,,Great view,4,,We went for an early session as we wanted to have lunch at the food center on the ground floor. We had a whole capsule to ourselves which was much more enjoyable though the view would have been more spectacular in the evening. The flight took about half an hour. The capsules were well airconditioned and comfortable. The kids had some fun feeding the fishes in the garden pond at the base of the flyer.,,,
,,Joy Ride with Business Colleagues,5,,"Great place for a business networking session in an informal atmosphere with breathtaking view, enjoyable slow pace and a choice of F&B facilities. This could be equally enjoyable for families or couples to have a good quality time together.",,,
,,great view of singapore,5,,"it gives great view of singapore, night and day view are completely different so its up to you. you can take good photos from top. If there is thunderstorm flyer will be stopped and you may have to wait so if any such weather issues enquire before you visit. Marina bay lights show and gardens by the bay lights show are 15-20 minutes walkable from flyer so you can plan accordingly. if you continue walking along river side you can pass by marina bay sands hotel, esplanade theatre and continue to walk till clark quay. It is long walk but worth it, many attractions along the way.",,,
,,Panoramic view,5,,One round in about half an hour. So slow that you don't realise its moving yet it is one of the best experiences to be had in Singapore. Gives an awesome view of city and other landmarks,,,
,,Good to See,4,,It is like London eye . You can See many of places from above of it.It is worth going to it. Marina sands by the bay is about 10 min walk.,,,
,,Object in the sky,4,,Looks pretty spectacular- only viewed this huge wheel but is a thing of Beauty at night lit up and looking spectacular,,,
,,Great experience,5,,"It's cool to ride in this as if it wasn't moving but it was, not shakey like with what I was thinking of. Nice view of Marina bay.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Don't worry about finding a seat if your car is full- better to stand and move around the capsule for photos. We went at dusk and took some lovely photos. Our capsule was full but there was enough room. Show your Singapore airlines boarding pass for a discount.
The concept of this place is great. You can get photos done - well actually I'm not sure that we had a choice! just ushered through- ""stand there"" snap!
Great thing to do.",,,
,,An amazing experience,5,,"Right by the Bay, this huge giant wheel called Singapore Flyer is a must visit. My suggestion will be to board it after 7 pm (it's open till 10 pm), so that you can enjoy the dazzling lights of the entire city, have a look at the golf course, the Garden by the Bay from the top. The cabins are beautiful, safe, air conditioned.

You can take your infants also in this Flyer.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,3,,If you don't have time but still want to see the big buildings or have loads of money or you are very old and can't get around the city this is a good option.,,,
,,30 min of skyline,4,,"30 min of singapore's skyine. see around twilight to witness gardens of the bay, esplanade, merlion park. clean pods offer a good view of the city. walk down the promenade later. good way to spend the evening",,,
,,Wow!!,4,,"This is a must visit place in Singapore, which gives glimpse of Singapore downtown and Marina bay area. The ticket price is SGD 33, ideally the entire compartment is given for one group which can accommodate 8-12 people. The ride takes almost 30 minutes to...More",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,4,,"We had a whole capsule to ourselves which was enjoyable. The flight took about half an hour. We walked to the Singapore Flyer from Suntec City which wasn't very well signed. When we arrived at the site it looked a bit deserted, but it was...More",,,
,,How were we to know that we'd have the whole compartment to ourselves?,5,,"This is a ""MUST SEE"" attraction. Book online as part of a ""hop on hop off"" bus excursion and the savings are staggering even though neither attraction is expensive you can virtually halve the cost. The experience is thrilling and the views extensively remarkable over...More",,,
,,A Thrilling Experience!,4,,"This review is quite late. For sure all of us have experienced riding on a Ferris Wheel but the Singapore Flyer brings this experience to a different level. Fine dining with a 360 degrees view of Singapore City. A ""must experience"" for all adventurous travelers.",,,
,,great views with dinner!,5,,"romantic dinner for 2, 1h long means you go around twice, dinner includes entree , soup, main and dessert",,,
,,Solo time at the wheel,5,,I went back to the wheel this time because the queues were good the entire concept is fantastic with the cabin rolling slowly so that you don't miss on anything I highly recommend the trip to the Singapore flyer,,,
,,"No, really.",1,,The flyer barely moves. Your money can be well spent on something else. Views are better from MBS or another building in the area.,,,
,,Costly but worth it,5,,My girlfriend and I visited the Singapore Flyer on a less crowded day. So we got one cabin by ourselves and enjoyed the beautiful view over Singapore. The flyer is more than 100m in height and is the costly but better alternative to the Marina...More,,,
,,Bucket list worthy.,5,,"I visited as part of a school trip and we went just before sunset. It was absolutely amazing, breathe taking city views. You'd be silly not to give the Singapore Flyer a go when in Singapore.",,,
,,"The Other ""best"" place to see sigapore",4,,"If you go to singapore i suggest to try this, but i advice you go after 18pm or 19.30pm. You can see best of the view in the evening in high.

I suggest more if you want go dinner with your lovely..try here. The singapore flyer provide dinner set couple.. is about $300++ something for 2person/couple. The flyer will turn 2 time for you. So you can get a romantic dinner ever here..",,,
,,Time pass,3,,The concept is ok and same like London eye . 45 min ride with full singapore view . Little boring but one time watch with family is ok,,,
,,"Seen one, seen them all",3,,"This is pretty much the same as any other Ferris wheel around the world. If you never been in one or you love them, it's great. Also good for great views of Singapore.",,,
,,"Nice way to see the city views, but Sky park is better!",4,,"Its a half an hour ride, during which you get some good views of the city. But if you want to see the city from the highest point, it would be better to have a view from the Sky park of Marina Bay sands. Definitely worth a try though.",,,
,,Great view at right time of day,4,,"This is a slow, relaxed trip around the ferris wheel, which at the right time of day has a great view (sunset especially good). I have been with a group in a catered car as a work outing, and that was a fun way to share the time and look out beyond Singapore.",,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,"This attraction is a must for those wanting views over Singapore from every angle. The wheel spins around and the carriage your sat in rotates on its' own axel, giving you views from every angle.",,,
,,Great Attraction,5,,"Singapore Flyer should be on your list of must-dos when you visit Singapore.

We went in August 2017 and had taken the viator tickets package so did not have to stand in the ticket queue. Pram Friendly right up to the entrance which is on a higher level. There's a security checkpoint where you need to leave the pram and other big bags. We went during the afternoon and there was a queue at the boarding post so it took us about 30 mins to board the flyer.

There were about 10 of us in a capsule which can accommodate upto 20. Very spacious and air conditioned. The view was excellent and the speed is simply perfect - neither too fast nor too slow. They make an announcement when your capsule is at the peak and you have ample time to take photos and capture the view!

All exits to tourist spots in Singapore are through Gift Shops and this was no exception. There are eating joints at the ground level and taxi stand is right in front",,,
,,Amazing View From the Flyer,5,,"It was an amazing experience inside this flyer. Once we reach at the top, the view is so good that you can see entire Singapore from inside the flyer.",,,
,,Look the mesmerizing city in 30 Minutes flats,5,,The 165-meter-high Flyer in Singapore's is comparable to the London Eye. It is the world's largest observation wheel and takes 30 Minutes for complete round. The best time to hitch a ride is at dusk when the entire row of downtown skyscrapers is softly lit. This enables you city view in daylight as well gleaming beauty of city in night with lights on,,,
,,Must do signature activity of being in Singapore,5,,The mechanism of the flyer is very astounding. the ferris wheel moves slower. you dont get the feel of moving at all. you get to see all the prominent places in the town. The entry is SGD 33 for adults. Worth the money.,,,
,,Great way to see Singapore,5,,"We we went around sunset, didn't have to wait, great views of the city Would definitely look into the hi tea option if I was to go again",,,
,,Excellent views - day and night.,5,,"Initially went on this during the day and there were only 3 of us in the capsule which apparently can take up to 28 people so plenty of space to move around and take pictures.
Reasonably clear day so views were good. Then went on it twice at night, first time good but second time a bit crowded.",,,
,,See it from above.,5,,"To see Singapore from the heights provides a memorable experience. Great views across the city, particularly taking in Gardens by the Bay.",,,
,,A great attraction!,5,,Go and do this. Find out when sunset is and try and get there about 40 mins before it is beautiful! Very easy to get to as well and there are some food outlets around there as well.,,,
,,Nice view,4,,Even though you can see a spectacular Singapore view if you have gone to any other wheels this is not different.I would rather to spend that money in a drink at the Marina Sand Bay Hotel roof top bar...spectacular view and it is unique in world.,,,
,,Great view,4,,Definitely a must do activity when visiting Singapore. Great view of the city. Pods are very spacious and lots of room to move around. Good opportunity to take some fantastic photos.,,,
,,nice to see it,4,,"is a nice attraction in singapore especially for couples , capsule was nice and comfort , u will be in it for a 30min , at the top u will see all the city and great view.
you can not reach it easily by using public transportaion u need around 40 min of waliking to reach it from the nearest metro stations",,,
,,Great Trip for Family,4,,We spent very nice moment and was unforgettable trip You should catch trip at 6:45pm so you can enjoy both view day and night,,,
,,Fantastic views,4,,"We went to the Singapore Flyer late one morning and there was nobody else there! We had no queues and were in a cabin all by ourselves which was great. The views were marvellous, although it would have been good to have some commentary (heard some faint commentary briefly) or a map in the cabin describing the sights.",,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,Visited with our grandchildren and they absolutely love it. The views are fantastic and as we visited at dusk we were lucky enough to catch the sunset and also the cityscape lighting up. The gardens and surrounds around the flyer are also well maintained.,,,
,,"Wow, a great view of Singapore and beyond.",5,,Loved this attraction. Beautiful views of Singapore. Even though I am not great on heights I found this attraction quite manageable.,,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"Awesome views, and well worth the visit - even for those with a fear of heights. We really enjoyed it, and fortunately we went during a quiet time so had the capsule to ourselves.",,,
,,Wonderful,4,,"Initially we were apprehensive about motion sickness but the speed of the flyer is controlled,that every one can enjoy.It gives wonderful view of Singapore,from such large glass windows and height. Amazing",,,
,,Impressive views,4,,The views on the whole are good. It has a limited amount of info in the cars so unless you know Singapore you may not always know what you are looking at. It would not be my top choice of attraction in Singapore.,,,
,,Beautiful View over Singapore,5,,"Beautiful View over Singapore. You wi麓ll see the Marina, the phantastic City. We go around the Formula 1 Night Race.",,,
,,Must see,5,,A giant wheel and a nice way to see entire Singapore in 30 mins. Can be visited in day or night but we preferred day time to see the skyline. The capsule was quite clean and the staff very cooperative.,,,
,,An excellent view of singapore,5,,Enjoyed singapore flyer with family. The experience was amazing. Never miss it while on singapore. It takes you 45 minutes above ground to view singapore .,,,
,,Incredible sunset view of the city,5,,"We planned to go on the Singapore flyer at sunset to see a bit of Singapore during day/ sunset/ evening and it was completely worthwhile. The half hour ride around gives stunning views of the city and is well worth the price. For those scared of heights the ride is not that bad, it does not feel like you are very high up and the flyer moves so slowly you hardly feel it. I would definitely recommend this if you visit Singapore!",,,
,,Loved it!!,5,,"This us definitely a highlight of a trip to Singapore. We might have been lucky but no queues when we went and in a great spot to see so much if Singapore - good value for money! We just got off the ""hop on hop off"" bus right out the front. Teenagers asked if we could do it again before we left - unfortunately it was closed for GP",,,
,,A View of Singapore,5,,The trip takes a total of 30 minutes. It doesn't go fast at all. You can see most of Singapore up there. Enjoy the view!,,,
,,Very Nice,4,,It was interesting but once you go to one in other countries it's no different but the view. You get a refreshing view of Singapore.,,,
,,Photos and more photos,5,,"As the trip spends about 30 minutes, if you have a digital camera or a smartphone, you can take thousands of photographs! No worries with bad pics, hehe, the view helps you!",,,
,,Great view but less exciting food,3,,Great experience to dine in the Flyer. Great view and table settings. But the food was not normal. Most of the $ is paid for the Flyer and the View.,,,
,,See for Miles,5,,A great experience and fabulous views of Singapore. We were there on a quiet day so we had a pod to ourselves. Staff very helpful and friendly. Highly recommended.,,,
,,Amazing Night View,5,,"We'd heard that they flyer was best viewed at night when you could take in the lights of the city and it was true. The views at night are spectacular and a wonderful way to enjoy the splendid architecture of Singapore. Overall the ride is well organised and even though there is a constant line of visitors waiting to get on, the line flows steadily. This attraction is well worth the visit.",,,
,,Cool way to see the city...,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a brilliant way to see the beautifully pristine city and Marina Bay.
We had an enjoyable day time ride and should have gone for the night time too but ran out of time there. You鈥檒l understand why after going around, the view is spectacular and would look unbelievable amazing after dark, especially the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Singapore gardens by the bay.",,,
,,Fantastic View,4,,"We were in Singapore on the stopover holiday package that included passes to the Singapore Flyer. It is a great way to see this magnificent City. It was a little hazy the day we went but it was still a great view.
We were fortunate enough to go when it was fairly quiet so there were only four of us in the capsule.
It is something that should be done when visiting Singapore.",,,
,,Seeing the world,5,,The iconic symbol of Singapore. Looks so beautiful from different angle and different parts of the city. The whole area becomes vibrant during day and night time with its elegant moves. The view from top is also glorious. Wonderful views. The Singapore Flyer is a must place to visit for those who did not have a chance to see Singapore from a Bird'eye view.,,,
,,Authentic Icon of City State,5,,All things that I felt in this flyer is worth. We can see the whole city during in the capsule. Better to go there in the morning with good weather due to the city view is really nice. Also do not forget to do good pose when taking a picture due to it is one of memorable experience there. Fully recommended and enjoyable.,,,
,,Amazing views,5,,I went just before the Grand Prix so great views of the pit lanes and race track were an added bonus. It gets dark early and quickly. I went around 6.30 where it was daylight when I got on and pitch black when I came off so I got to see all the lights. It's approx 30 mins long and $33 sgd well worth it,,,
,,Expensive but a must-see,5,,"If you do one expensive thin in Singapore, this should be it. It was totally worth it for a fun evening and we all loved the views. The ferris wheel moves very slowly, nothing scary for little kids.",,,
,,Go.... Just go....,5,,"The Flyer is worth the time and money easily. Pick a clear day, and enjoy. The whole experience is very well organized and really a must-do when in Singapore.",,,
,,Let's Fly High,4,,"Singapore Flyer is a Giant Observation Wheel, its best way to see the panoramic view of Singapore in just 30 minutes (one round). It's situated at the heart of Singapore i.e. Marina Bay. Flyer is very popular among tourists. It was completely awesome experience. From our air-conditioned glass capsule, we were thrilled to look over the entire Garden by the Bay, enormous Marina Bay Sands, Singapore River, Skyscrapers, Merlion Park.",,,
,,Our visit to the Singapore flyer,4,,The Singapore flyer is amazing the view is spectacular and the gardens and fish below are gorgeous to walk through . I took my granddaughter today we are on a special holiday and was furious when the lady I was buying the ticket from questioned her age she is tall and gorgeus but was very embarrassed by someone questioning me whether I lying over her age I found this very confronting and she was upset we come from a family of tall people and should not have to excuse ourselves because we are she is still a little girl and should be treated as such bad tick Singapore flyer,,,
,,Well worth a visit.,5,,"The views from this structure are fantastic. The individual pods are nice and cool, and comfortable. Photographers will get some shots but they will be through glass; so you may get some internal reflections etc. But with care, shots can be got.

This wasn't overly expensive, and it was well worth doing. One thing to bear in mind is that if some extreme weather is predicted, they will close the ticket booth. This *nearly* stopped us going on the Flyer but luckily the weather risk dissipated just as we were thinking of going elsewhere.

Also: we went on the Flyer at night, which was great. I'm pretty sure it will also be great during the day. If we went again, I'd try and schedule a daytime visit too.",,,
,,Mixed feelings,2,,The flyer is huge. Moves very slowly so that u can enjoy yhe scene of Singapore from the air. Unfortunately the day we ventured out was hazy and nothing much was visible. So we felt as if we didn't get our money's worth.,,,
,,Great way to see all of Singapore,4,,"I was recommended this place by the taxi driver on the way to Marina Bay Sands. This is a great way to see all of Singapore, especially on a sunny day. The hawkers' food court under the flyer is a great place to eat as well.

Unfortunately (Fortunately?), there weren't many people on the day I went so it didn't feel very vibrant.

I would recommend this for family and group of friends/couples.",,,
,,Great view!!!,5,,"This was the best view of Singapore, I'm afraid of heights but this was apart of the package holiday that I bought so I decided to get on, I'm glad that I did it was a fantastic view. I did get a little dizzy so I sat down most of the ride but I still was able to see all the sights.",,,
,,excellent view of the city,4,,"If you're not afraid of heights this is the best way to see singapore. We went there at night time, expect a little queue but its worth it, seeing the stunning city lights. The car goes really slowly, so its very comfortable inside.",,,
,,Great panoramic views of Singapore if you can afford it! :),3,,"Singapore Flyer used to be the world's tallest Ferris Wheel between 2008 to 2014. That is why you get some fantastic panoramic views of Singapore!

At the peak you can see the Singapore Grand Prix circuit, Marina Bay Sands, Gardens By The Bay and a 360 degree view of the city skyline.

It does cost 33 Singapore Dollars for a 30 minute rotation though, so a bit on the expensive side! :)",,,
,,Great views,5,,This is a typical ferris wheel attraction but the views of singapore are awesome We went at dusk so we saw the sun down and the sky scrapers ligjting up. Great experience.,,,
,,Wonderful,5,,On top of the world ... Worth every penny spent.. take this early in your trip so you can plan all places you want to see,,,
,,Feel On Top of the World!,5,,"Great attraction for all ages. Views of the city are priceless and the size and design of the capsules are futuristic, comfortable and spacious - my friend and I only shared with one other person. Had no problem with tickets, queues, cost or length of the ride. Shops, ATMs all at the location. Very close to other things to do and easy to get to.",,,
,,Night time must do,4,,Great view of Singapore by night - haven't done day time but really comes into its own at night time with lights in city. Similar to London Eye in terms of speed and overall experience. Apparently it is taller than the Eye.,,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,"Our family had a great time on the Singapore flyer, what a wonderful attraction, amazing views of Singapore highly recommended attraction",,,
,,great attraction,5,,"Great views of Singapore in all directions, it takes around half an hour to go around they also have special trips around to",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"Not for those who are scared of heights. Singapore flyer was at one stage the tallest Ferris wheel in the world which means it provides some stunning landscape views over the city. Look out over the world's busiest shipping channel, see how the citizens of Singapore live, watch people playing soccer on a floating soccer field, and get undisturbed views of Marina Bay Sans and the Merlion. Each cabin is air-conditioned and is very comfortable. A cycle of the wheel takes roughly 30 minutes.

The flyer also boasts an interactive learning area at the entrance explaining the history of the flyer and how it was designed. Very interesting and worth a visit.",,,
,,Very smooth ride experience,4,,"""Experience"" is the catch word these days... and the Flyer provides a customer-friendly ticketing process and entrance to the attraction. There's even a number of shops (best for browsing) and the little fish that nibble at your feet (I've forgotten what you call them).

Getting on and off the ""capsule"" as it slowly passes along the boarding dock is surprisingly easy (easier than cable cars and other similar people transporters). Up in the air, you don't even realise you are moving, except that the view changes a we go higher and higher.
Confession - we've been on the Flyer a couple of times - last one was more than 2 years ago.
Comment - the Singapore skyline continues to change and it's fun to try to spot differences since last time we took the trip.",,,
,,View the city in comfort,4,,There are 2 ways to use the flyer. Day and night. Both are good value. At night if you time your trip to match the light show from marina bay sands the view is spectacular.,,,
,,Amazing view,4,,"This was at one point, the biggest ferris wheel in the world. You can sit back, relax and look at a beautiful Singapore skyline. Would recommend for first time visitors.",,,
,,Great view of Singapore,3,,"Both day and night have it's own beauty of Singapore. It can see the river and sea on one side, another side is the city view of Singapore!",,,
,,amazing views,4,,"Unfortunately the queue to the flyer was extremely long and the 5 families in front were very loud and impatient pushing infront of other families, however once on the ride it was worth the wait, naturally with the haze in Singapore we probably could have seen further on a clear day",,,
,,exciting to veiw,4,,What a view...... felt very safe and secure...even though Im not one for heights. Goes round VERY slow. Great views.,,,
,,Fly high,5,,"Ooo..what a beautiful view.had a very good time with kids.
It starts early in the morning when other attractions are closed.
We were there by 11am and didn't find any queue.
Amazing views on a clear day.
During evening hours u may find queues but the flayer never stops and its a big advantage.
It goes slowly so no need be worried about the height.
But if u plan to cover the ride during late afternoon and evening hours u can get some splndid pics.
There is a"" Duck and Hippo"" tour planner outlet nearby.There u can get some amazing deals and discount offers for different attractions.",,,
,,Great views but there are other 'must sees' for me in Singapore,3,,"We only did this because it was included as an option on our Singapore Airlines stopover package. I would probably not have paid the $33 each to do this otherwise. The view is certainly impressive and the view looking down onto the Gardens by the Bay from the top makes you realize how high up you are. As others have mentioned, it takes around 30 minutes to do a full circuit and the pods are very large. We were lucky and had only us and another family in ours because it was quiet when we went (at around 1.30pm on a Monday). For me, there are other more impressive things to do in Singapore that are unique to Singapore - like their stunning Botanical Gardens or the Gardens by the Bay, or even Orchid Road for shopaholics. If you like views, maybe you'd like this a lot more than I did. Our photos didn't turn out so well because it was quite hazy from the heat at that time of the day. It didn't impede the view, its just that the photos don't have great colour to them. I think this would be more impressive at night.",,,
,,Breathtaking and far reaching views,5,,"We had free access to the Singapore flyer as part of our formula 1 tickets. We went on it during the afternoon and at night. Both times offered breathtaking and far reaching views of the city skyline, the marina bay area, vessels at sea, and the F1 circuit. A must do in Singapore.",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"Amazing views, very peaceful. The staff are super friendly! Lots to see and do before you actually get onto the flyer so give yourself plentiy of time because we didn't realise there was so much to do.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer Wheel,5,,"We enjoyed the Singapore Flyer.It is a little expensive,but good,especially at night,which has all the lights of Singapore.It even has a dinner section,seperate from the other tourists,and does 2 loops taking 1 hour, but is expensive. Food is typical Singapore mix.",,,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,The views from here are stunning. Photo opportunities are immense. You feel like you can see all of Simgapore from up here. Whilst there may be a line up initially there are only minor delays to access.,,,
,,Singapore from Above,5,,"You can see the entire Singapore from the top of the wheels. A great view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, Garden by the Bay, the Magnificent F1 paddock from Above, and the beautiful buildings that Singapore is famed about.

Singapore Flyer is very smooth, you will hardly feel the movement or the transition from the bottom to the top of the circle, it's just amazingly stable, no vibration, and no wind intrusion whatsoever.",,,
,,Flyer.....,5,,Once you are on top of flyer you can see everything in Singapore. Felt why should go down... Very good views in all directions,,,
,,Stunning views,5,,The flyer is like any other giant eye in other parts of the world and is good to get some really good views of Singapore skyline. It is a nice slow ride to the top and back with views of two sides of the city and its gardens as well as skyscrapers.,,,
,,Birds Eye View of Singapore,5,,"The Singapore flyer is the larger than the London Eye, although larger it has fewer pods. Having taken a ride in the London eye I found this to be better.
We took the flyer during the daytime. Surprisingly there was no crowd on that day & we had the entire capsule to ourselves. The views from the capsules are amazing and you can see for miles. Each ride takes around 30 mins and it is extremely stable and secure so you do not feel nervous or anxious at all, I can vouch for this as I suffer from vertigo. Must see if you are visiting Singapore.",,,
,,for the great view,5,,"Yes, a great view at an affordable price. If you're bunked in a backpack hostel, then this is your chance to see Singapore from a height. Be wow-ed. This is a beautiful country, compacted, yet highly functional and successful.",,,
,,Gaint wheel,3,,The flyer looks very attractive but not amazing I dint find fun riding it It drives very slow But u can see the entire city once u reach top The scenery is very nice,,,
,,Fantastic View of the city,5,,Fantastic way to see the whole city. My husband and i left it to the end of our trip to go on the flyer which worked well as by that stage we had explored the city and could pick out places we had been more easily than if we didn't know what we were looking at. Well worth the money.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer a must visit,5,,"A visit to Singapore is incomplete without a visit to the Singapore flyer. The ideal time to visit is just before sunset and ride through the next thirty minutes with Singapore coming alive in all its beauty, well lit up. One gets a 360 degree view of Singapore, but what I enjoyed most was a view of the Marina Bay and the buildings around. I have travelled on this flyer both during day time and also during sunset and onwards. The beauty of watching it in the evening is unsurpassed. The tickets at SGD 33.00 I thought was a little on the higher side but the unparalleled view compensated the high price. Visitors have the option of a cocktail ride or dinner ride or a VIP ride at of course higher prices. But do visit once and specially towards evening.",,,
,,Up to your interests...,3,,"Well, as for me so being there was just an a ""must be"" entertainment. We were in the evening there. The circle is moving very slow, so you should thing abt your human needs before riding (toilet). Especially if you are with child. The rest is quite expectable. Beautiful night Singapore view and a photo on exit) abt $30..
Enter sin $33 per person.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Fabulous views, particularly of marina bay. I think night time views would be amazing but unfortunately I couldn't fit it in.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Ticket is considered pricey but definately worth the ride! You get to see nice scenery. At night will have nicer scenery then in the day.,,,
,,Amazing Views of the city.,5,,This amazing attraction is fantastic. Smooth ride in glass pods takes you high above the city to give you the best views and perspective on this amazing city. The air-conditioned pods have info in them on the sights you can see and its a very gentle experience that gives you views you would never otherwise see. A magical experience that I would do again.,,,
,,Exciting view from the wheel,4,,"I just came in the afternoon and the place is not crowded. From the wheel we can see : F 1 track, Garden by the bay, Merlion and several other interesting places. The view will be better at dusk.",,,
,,Beautiful,4,,What an amazing sunset Very happy we got a sunset Good and efficient service by the staff Thanks. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,,,
,,Average,3,,"If you went already to Marina Bay Sands Sky Park , then dont go as you will not see anything new , it is a high place that will show you the same city landscapes! Organized place with nice staff",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"Booked the dinner tour for two couples. Did not expect much from the food, however was pleasantly surprised the food was really good. We did the 7:30 tour and the views with the city all light up was amazing.",,,
,,Fantastic views,4,,"I enjoyed the stunning views from the Flyer. I was really pleased that it was easy to access with a wheelchair. In fact, I was free - my husband paid, but I was in free as a disabled person.

The 30 minutes trip showed amazing views. The pod has a bench for sitting and is air conditioned. You get a feel for the size of the city and its continued growth. It is easy to take good photos from, especially if you have a zoom lens.

A very enjoyable experience.",,,
,,A great landmark of Singapore.,5,,"Must see, this Singapore flyer is the larger version of the London Eye, although larger it has fewer pods than the London eye.",,,
,,Great views from an air conditioned capsule!,5,,"See the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Gardens by the Bay and the downtown area all from an air conditioned capsule. Great photo shots from high in the air (albeit with windows between you and the shots.) Very slow ride, so if you have no interest in pictures, it could be a little boring. (Each capsule seats 6-8 people.)
Unfortunately, on the day we visited, the F1 race blocked off some streets so public transportation couldn't go right to the Flyer, but we did hike there without too much overheating. Also, we had just eaten lunch, so we didn't try any of the available food at the site, but I would guess you could find some delicious food on site (street type & sit down restaurants).
I was there in the afternoon, but I'd guess the night views would be terrific! Great place to cool off & relax your feet for about twenty minutes. (Price is in range of other entertainment at 33 SG for adults.)",,,
,,AMAZING VIEW AND RIDE,5,,"What an amazing view from this ride, takes in so much of Singapore and the ocean, it is amazing how many ships you can see in the ocean. Not a scary ride, nice and smooth.",,,
,,Great Ferris Wheel Attraction,4,,30 minutes rotation and at 165m high this Ferris wheel attraction is perhaps the most popular and a must visit in Singapore. Conveniently located in Marina Bay and easily reached by MRT or on foot the views of Singapore are great. We have done the trip by day and at night. The day trip points out many of the landmarks to visit whilst the night gives breathtaking panoramic views of the City skyline and the magnificent Marina Bay. Be careful of the haze so select your day for best weather. Peak times are 6-8pm and its worth the cost but the sky dining service is expensive. We choose a champagne cocktail trip which gave access to the lounge prior to departure. Will do again.,,,
,,Wonderful views,5,,"Views were amazing from the capsules, we had one to ourselves which is very spacious. The staff were informative and gave great information about the flyer and why it was created. The time will go so quick so take in every moment. Below the flyer is local food so you can experience local culture as well as some western food stalls.",,,
,,The trip was awesome at flyer,5,,The flyer moves slowly so that everyone can view the whole city from the flyer and it was a awesome exprience for 33$ SGD per person I think it is worth the money....,,,
,,Nice view,4,,"I came here because i got a free access from F1 Singapore.
It's a nice place to explore, and i really enjoy the sunset view in here.
I'm not really explore this place because i have to get back to F1 zone again, but i think i'm will going to this place again.",,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,The views from the capsules is amazing and you can see for miles. We did the flyer at night and Singpore at night is gorgeous.,,,
,,Impressive Views over Singapore,5,,"We took in a ride on the Singapore Flyer as part of our Singapore Airlines Tourist pass and went at 5pm on a Monday.
The place was pretty quiet and we even had our own carriage!
The views were as expected somewhat complete and comprehensive overlooking most of the region and beyond.

Great ride, helpful staff and a must do if you want to experience a world class attraction",,,
,,Would be fantastic on a clear day.,4,,The day we chose to take the Flyer was rather hazy so our experience was lessened. The cabins are large and clean with seats (if you can stay in one place to use them). We were lucky in that there were only 2 other couples in the cabin so we had lots of room to walk around taking photos.,,,
,,Breathtaking View From The Top Of Flyer,5,,You will experience a breathtaking view of Singapore from the top of the flyer. Must see if you are visiting Singapore.,,,
,,Exactly what I expected,5,,Wonderful views of the environs .... what more could you want? Would have been nicer without the group we shared the pod with but that's life!,,,
,,What a view,5,,"Awesome view from the flyer as you go up and around, a must for anyone visiting Singapore. A lot to see from it",,,
,,Worth a ride.,4,,Great way to see the city and get your bearings too. Just turned up so no need to book. Takes about 30 minutes to do a circuit. Plenty of good photo opportunities and time to take in the outstanding views.,,,
,,Wonderful Scenic View,5,,"A half hour ride for 1 rotation, but price quite high. We could see all Singapore at the top of the rotation, by 360 panoramic view. We hardly enjoy the view since we were busy taking photographs lol..
It's recommended for those who have never board this ride.
Considering the price, it's better for a one time ride only.",,,
,,Bird's Eye View,4,,"We decided to go on the Singapore Flyer in order to get a good view of Singapore, it was right on the route of our Hop On Hop Off bus and was near Gardens by the Bay, so 3 points out of 3. We actually got a discount as I still had our boarding passes in my bag( thank you Singapore Airlines) and we had a lovely time.....just like the Melbourne Eye. The carriage was clean but air conditioning must have been on low, but not unbearable.",,,
,,Amazing Views of Singapore,5,,"We had tickets to the F1 race which gave us free access to the flyer and it was fantastic. The views over Singapore and the circuit at night were spectacular, I would highly recommend a trip on the Flyer even when the race isn't on.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Great attraction and worth a visit. Good see the whole city. In 30 minutes in capsule we decided to go to various attractions nearby.
Watch out for pricey bars at riverside. SD 6.50 to SD 18.00.
Excellent views and don't forget your camera.
Good to see during the day to appreciate the landmarks or night time for lights all round. Whichever you'll love it.",,,
,,Most memorable!!!,5,,"We went on and enjoyed the dining experience on the wheel ride. We got engaged that night which makes this place most memorable. Aside from that, great view from the top. Nice place to be proposed to.",,,
,,Go There At Night,5,,"We walked there from Marina Bay and although the walk could get you all sweaty even at dusk, we were glad we had stuck to the plan to go on the Flyer cos it was a lovely experience that is absolutely breath-taking. It's the height if 42 storey building and even taller than London Eye. Each ride takes around 30 mins and it is extremely stable and secure so you do not feel nervous or anxious at all.
It was not a busy night when we went and we could get on a passenger car having to wait for just 15 mins. We were a party of three and had to share the lift with three other young girls but that was ok cos the passenger car is spacious enough for the six of us to walk freely around, or to sit there and gaze at the beautiful city. Each of us had enough space to enjoy the magnificent view from 165 m above, we did not feel cramped at all.
We were totally captivated by the stunning scenery of Singapore skyline at night, with its beautiful lights shimmering in the distance. There was no disturbing music playing and that is good , cos we would not be disturbed or distracted by any noise and could fully focus on aesthetic scene after scene that fed our eyes.
We were treated to 360 degrees of unobstructed views of iconic and historic landmarks and all of us were able to capture vivid memorable moments even with our smartphones cos the glass panels were very clean and smudge free.
We strongly recommend this Singapore Flyer to any tourist, and a strong advice is--- go at night.",,,
,,Nice sunset view of Singapore,5,,The Singapore flyer do provides a nice sunset and night view of Singapore. Very suitable all types of tourist to enjoy an evening. Besides there are shops and eateries on the site . Wonderful experience in Singapore !,,,
,,Great views,5,,Did the Singapore flyer before during the day and did this at night this time round. Was awesome as we went to the grand prix so it was an excellent view of the track and the Singapore skyline at night. Absolutely breathtaking.,,,
,,Nighttime panorama,4,,"Orderly queuing and boarding before a relaxing ""flight"" taking in Singapore's night time best. Somewhat dependant on the courtesy of your fellow guests, generally you can get a good look in each direction from multiple heights. Central seating is handy when tired. Duration about right, but a touch expensive.",,,
,,Good getaway for a couple of hours !!,4,,Panoramic views... Smooth ride... Nice build-up - both informative & entertaining - right from security screening till boarding. Good restaurant options after alighting & don't miss the Gelatissmo ice-creams before leaving.,,,
,,Price was worth the view,4,,"We rode the 7:30pm ""flight"". It was just the right time to see the Singapore skyline before the sun set. The Flyer was quite pricey for SGD33, but the view was definitely worth the price!",,,
,,Amazing,5,,It is a 30 minute panoramic ride 165 meters above ground level. It moves so slowly and gently that you have a feeling of contentment.,,,
,,Not bad...,3,,"Well, this is like a big round wheel locates nicely so you can see most of the Singapore landscape.

The view was great, not much crowd at that time, so it really was a nice ride. However i prefer something more natural and you need to spend a bit of effort to enjoy the view around Singapore.

It's cost SGD 33 to take the ride,i think it should have mrt station closed down, but i'm not sure as there are 4 of us, and it's easier to take taxi.

If you happen to have limited time in singapore this could be a good choice to enjoy it's landscape.",,,
,,Informative,4,,It was an informative ride. We were able to learn more about SG. Too bad it was foggy (smog?) when we went there so we couldn't see the view clearly.,,,
,,Best View,5,,"One of the best wheel attractions I've been on. The Flyer has a large history and science museum on the way to the wheel, explaining how it was made and the people & physics behind it's constructions. The ride itself offers a breathtaking view of the city. We went during the day and could see the entire city. Would love to try it again at night!",,,
,,Feel like a dream on the Flyer!,5,,"It's one of the best way to see night view in the world! Also there are many amenities,too Oh Hawker center was there! You can find many street food! Great night veiw and food, which were fantastic enough to make my day!",,,
,,Great views but expensive for family,3,,"4 year old daughter enjoyed walking through the garden and feeding fish before going on the flyer. Great views especially my husband was interested in F1 course which this was right over pit lanes and gave views out over the city including gardens and marina bay sands. We had a whole car to ourselves which was threat to move around freely and sit as we please. Was expensive for a family 2 adults and a 4 year old, under 3 are free though. May be worth looking into it as part of a multi attraction pass for better value for money!",,,
,,Very Interesting,5,,Seeing the sites of Singapore from the flyer was excellent. The views of the city and the river and Marina Bay from the sky was wonderful,,,
,,A must do!! 360 degree views of Singapore,5,,"This GOW or Giant Observation Wheel held the record as the worlds tallest, till Las Vegas needed a new attraction and someone built one 2 metres taller in 2014.
That said, you could argue that this wheel provides some of the best views you are ever likely to see from any observation structure. And due to the mechanics of the pods that take you up, these are uninterrupted views.
The pods are very well designed so you can see everywhere. That said, I would recommend going on a week day during the day so you can possibly have a pod to yourself. The late afternoon and nights get a lot busier. I think you get a greater experience during the day being able to see more.
The ride is a very smooth and peaceful. The wheel never stops, so there are no jolts or bumps.",,,
,,Tallest wheel in the world,5,,"The views from the wheel are excellent, Particularly of the F1 circuit. Very reasonably priced and a must do event.",,,
,,Great 360 degree views,5,,We had complimentary access to the flyer by virtue of our Formula 1 Grand Prix tickets for the weekend. What a great all around view we got from the flyer! We felt all of Singapore was at our feet. Highly recommended.,,,
,,A lovely 40 minutes city scape viewing,5,,"Best place to watch the whole city of Singapore, all attractions are visible from the flyer, situated just next to Formula 1 track. ArtScience Museum, Marina Bay Sands, Flower Dome, Gardens by the bay Etc are visible. nice experience and comfy inside.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Went early in the morning and being a public holiday it was not crowded at all, tickets were not too pricey and was worth every buck spent as the sights were breathtaking and awesome, on my next trip to Singapore I will certainly do the experience at night to witness the night lights of Singapore as it is beautiful at night as well.",,,
,,Enjoyed this.,4,,We had a stop over in Singapore and this was one of the attractions we chose. We enjoyed the ride and it was a great photo opportunity. You can see the Singapore sky line and the docks and river. Very clean area and no trouble getting tickets and the buses stop right outside.,,,
,,Singapore Sling Flight,5,,"We took a 730pm flight with a celebratory Singapore Sling for a birthday flight- had the capsule to ourselves and were treated to a fantastic vista. Had the capsule to ourselves (4 people) Amazing views of the laser light show across the city. Only complaint is that it was over too soon. Takes 30 minutes, seemed like 5-10.",,,
,,Must see attracttion,4,,Brilliant views and photo opportunities from the Singapore Flyer. Easily accessible and lots of food options. A must see when visiting Singapore.,,,
,,Worth doing at least once,4,,Goods views once you get up towards the top. Not sure it's worth the $33 entry fee but as we had access to it during the F1 as part of our entry fee it's was worth having a look.,,,
,,Go at night for best views!,5,,If you can time your 30 minute ride between 7:;20-7:40PM you can watch the Super Trees show at the Gardens Of The Bay across the marina at the same time you are in the flyer. The super tree show is from 7:45PM to 8:00PM. Try and go on a weekday when it is not so crowded. They will put 28 people in the car when it is busy! If you purchase the Hop On Hop Off bus tickets you will receive a discount on the ticket price of the flyer. Plus the Flyer is on many of their bus runs. We felt the price was well worth the trip. If you are here when the Grand Prix is running you can watch the cars on the track!,,,
,,Stunning view from the flyer!,5,,Singapore such a beautiful country! We both loved it. Singapore flyer view was stunning. All staff very friendly and polite.,,,
,,Great views of the city,5,,One of the Great Observation Wheels of the World. Fantastic views of the city and across into Gardens By The Bay and the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Cabins are really large and air conditioned which makes for a very comfortable flight.,,,
,,best view ever,5,,"we went there at night and it was not a surprise ,,, the best night view in Singapore even the tickets wasn't that pricey and we had a very great time I highly recommend u to visit it",,,
,,Good view!,5,,"This gives you an amazing view of the skyline of Singapore. You don't realise how large the city is until you go up in the flyer.

The round trip takes around 40mins. Cabins are air conditioned. Do this first then walk over the Helix bridge to the Science Centre. Then go inside the adjacent building have some great lunch (cheap too) in the food court downstairs. Do some shopping then head up to Level 4 and take the roof top walkway to the Gardens by the Bay - around 10 mins walk via the Marina Bay Sands Hotel (walkway goes through the middle of it).",,,
,,Interesting place to see,5,,Enjoyed there & taken lot of photographs of Singapore from Height. This was amazing scene from top. Full view.,,,
,,GP,5,,If you have Zone 1 tickets this is free to use over GP weekend. 40 minute ride with aircon great for watching support race's remember your radio for race commentary,,,
,,landmark of Singapore,4,,"We bought duck trip and Singapore flyer tickets together to get discount, and after duck trip, there will be a free shuttle to singapore flyer. we went there in the morning, so there are not so many people, the whole visit take half hour, you could see the river, the merlon, the park and the sands hotel. it worth the ticket",,,
,,Good spot to see Singapore,4,,Overall a great spot to take in the size of Singapore which you don't get from the ground. Biggest bonus was air conditioned cabins.,,,
,,"Excellent, but signage could be better",4,,"We visited for free during F1 weekend and maybe it was because we entered from the circuit, but the signage to actually get to the Flyer entrance was appalling. Maybe if we'd had to pay at the ticket office it would have been clearer, but on a very hot and humid afternoon, we had to backtrack a couple of times and staff were of no help.
Once we got to the entrance our experience was wonderful - the views on what was a clear day were spectacular and we got to see one of the F1 support races from the Flyer",,,
,,Awesome views,5,,Went the day before the grand prix just before sunset great circuit views and cityview total must do,,,
,,Singapore Flyer - A must see,5,,Singapore Flyer is a life time experience similar to London Eye will give you a 360 degree panoramic city tour experience - from Jurong to Changi to Sentosa and beyond. You will enjoy locating city's famous landmarks. Must see when you are in Singapore,,,
,,Night view is better on Singapore Flyer,4,,"We caught the last ride at night time and were the only passengers in the capsule. The experience is cool and entertaining. We can sing, dance and scream inside the capsule and enjoyed the view of the city. Highly recommended.",,,
,,Interesting,5,,We went there during the day and the view was nice. I am sure in the night it is as well great. But we plan to go to last floor in Marina Bay hotel in the night so we separate 2 different attractions with day and night view and this is most correct.,,,
,,Great city views,5,,"We visited at 15:30 and walked straight up to the flyer and into a pod by ourselves. Staff very friendly and welcoming. The walk to the flyer through the exhibits was a bit boring and I felt like it's just a typical sales promotional thing to make you feel you are getting your moneys worth and also to distract if you have to wait in line for ages.
Views spectacular and ride very smooth. Probably one of the highlights of Singapore. A night time trip would be great also however imagine it would be busier.",,,
,,Amazing view from the top,4,,"This is famous location in Singapore. The view from the top point is amazing. The night view is just awesome,",,,
,,Great views,5,,Visited at night and views were great. Likely good in daytime too. Another perspective of the city. Pictures came out well,,,
,,Great view,5,,Did this both at night and in the day. Great views from every point and we'll priced. Champagne flight at night was a high point. Did go during day for fp1 of the Singapore f1,,,
,,good,5,,it had a small hatch for us to stay inside for many minutes . we could take pictures of the singapore river and the exspanade known as the huge durian.,,,
,,Singapore Odyssey.,3,,"A good way to get an overview of Singapore,especially if combined with a river cruise or City/Bay walk.A visit to a nightclub in one of the fancy bars high in the sky is probably more fun.",,,
,,Visit during F1 practice,5,,We took a trip in the flyer during a practice session for the Singapore Grand Prix and were fortunate to be on the ride as it got dark. Views over the city and the race track are amazing,,,
,,Do this your first morning,4,,"Great way to figure the layout of town by going around in your air conditioned tube. You can sit or stand, stay in the middle or peer over the edge and either way it's a fun way to see what Singapore has to offer",,,
,,Top of the world,5,,"Nice air conditioned flight. we had a carriage to ourselves. We've seen this in the Singapore skyline every day and night, so had to try it. Would benefit from tourist info being piped in during the circuit.",,,
,,Free with F1 ticket,5,,"Our pass for our F1 weekend gave us unlimited use of the big wheel we went around one prior to one of the practice session and took some superb photos as you get great views of the track and the city
Excellent food stalls right underneath too",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"We got to use this free for the Grand Prix weekend and the views, especially at night were breathtaking",,,
,,Beautiful at night,5,,Our second trip on the Singapore Flyer was at night and I really recommend this. Such gorgeous views of the city! Singapore Airlines boarding pass privileges also earns a discount on ticket prices!,,,
,,Closed for F1,1,,"We were most upset and disappointed that we couldn't get in to the flyer whole we were at the F1. We had tickets for the wrong area and even though the kind security guards let us in to the flyer, we couldn't go on it as the ticketing booths were closed.
We were happy to pay but could not. My son was very let down and it put a bit of a damper on the occasion.
I write this review ONLY to share our experience and warn everyone for next year, should the F1 even rake place. Who knows at the moment?",,,
,,Great View of Singapore,5,,"Itz a must go for all travellers. A great experience. They charge SGD 33 per person, slightly on a higher side.",,,
,,Great Singapore view day and night,3,,"This giant observation wheel is one of the highest ones in the world and it does indeed
make for a good view . We went in the day , there was not much crowd/queues but
it was all that we expected . Kids though were disappointed since they were more into
thriller rides and didnt like the slow movement of this but we appreciate the views
and like it .",,,
,,Memorable ride,5,,"It was like about a 30 min ride and feel like you are inside a capsule, you get to see the entire Singapore. The capsule was very spacious and the adjacent capsule to ours was used as a private dining spot. Beautiful idea!",,,
,,Awesome,5,,"Another must-do while in Singapore. Amazing views of the city. A very outstanding experience. There is a nice food court in the ground level with awesome asian food (street stall style). Best time to visit right around sunset, so book in advance!",,,
,,Hyped up experience,3,,"One of the most boring experiences. The speed of the Flyer is so slow. And you expect that you might see the heavens once you are on top,, and when you reach on the top...Boring!",,,
,,A must do,5,,Great views from all aspects. Staff helpful. Did this during the day would be an amazing site at night.,,,
,,Loved the views,5,,Got a free ride with our tickets to the Grand Prix. The views are outstanding and wished we could return again to the flyer at night,,,
,,A Very Big Wheel!,5,,"We visited here during the day, a lovely view overlooking Singapore city, marina and port, no queues to worry about. Part of the F1 street track is just outside this site",,,
,,Please put air condition in there (please),4,,"Went on there to watch the sun go down and was a beautiful thing to witness. Would recommend it! (It goes super super slow so if you're going to do a timelapse you best have spare battery haha)

I would say be prepared for it to a little hot in the bubble (whatever you call it haha)",,,
,,View of city & sea,4,,"Fantastic views across the city, seeing modern skyscrapers, well planned and integrated with old & new buildings. Slow moving and experience of a life time!",,,
,,Great views of the city,4,,"We went here on our first afternoon as it was close to the hotel and not too taxing after a long flight. It was surprisingly empty so we got straight on with only 2 other couples. It goes really slow so plenty of opportunity to take loads of photos. Great views from all over.
Got a bit scary when we were at the top and we got a thunder & lightning storm and as soon as we disembarked the flyer was closed due to the weather. Didn't feel unsafe though.
Overall glad we did it and would recommend it if you're not scared of heights.",,,
,,day and night trips,5,,"You can go on this Flyer either the day or the night. You still get to catch an awesome view of the surrounding. From here on, you may hop onto the duck boat. The best Ferris wheel in the world. Better than the one in London.",,,
,,Slow & smooth top experience.,5,,"Why this is great?
1-----This is second largest giant wheel.
2------cabin carrying 28 person.
3------30 minutes ride is enough to see / feel/ & enjoy
Great view from top.
4------Take evening time so can see day light & with
Night lighting also.
5----- Book with online maybe discount offers are
Available. & get Singapore Airlines boarding
Pass & get some 10% discount,so carry that.
6-----All age can do this very safe.
7----- moving very slowly,
8----- 33 SGD is okay .",,,
,,Largest wheel in Asia,4,,"We went on the Singapore Flyer because its a landmark and a must for tourists. It takes around 30 mins for a full round and is similar to the London Eye. You have great views of Marina bay, Gardens by the bay and the financial hub. We went at night so didn't had to wait very long in the queue. There's a bench inside to sit on and the temperature inside was quite pleasant. There are restaurants in the building connecting to the Flyer but they close at 10pm and won't take customers after 9:30 pm.",,,
,,Very nice and gives a Bird's eye view of the City.,5,,"Very well maintained and constructed Flyer, you have to board and disembark it in running mode. It slowly takes you up and in about 45 minutes round brings you down. When you are at the top, it gives a Bird's eyeview of the whole city, which is immense and beautiful. Worth every penny.
Get down and have the Ice Cream from nearby shop, which we enjoyed thoroghly.",,,
,,good views of the city and the bay,5,,"look down from the top over the wonderful Singapore, trace out the GP circuit and take millions of photos!",,,
,,top of world,4,,"my only suggestion for flyer is to visit in evening , as my morning visit was little boring. in lighting Singapore views are very goods",,,
,,Nice night and day view,5,,In this place you can see all Singapore. And you can take so many pictures for your memory. Wonderful amazing,,,
,,SG Flyer with the family,4,,"I like such kind of experience like London eye and SG flyer where you can have a 360 degree view of the city from the top. SG flyer was clean, well organised and the experience was enjoyable.",,,
,,Great views on a rainy day!,4,,"We took the trip on the Singapore Flyer just as the tropical shower came down but it had soon passed and we enjoyed the views across Singapore including the construction of the Formula One Pit area. Whilst the Flyer does not have a commentary like the London Eye, it is nevertheless worth taking the ride.",,,
,,SINGAPORE FLYER-GIANT WHEEL,5,,"I visited Singapore Flyer,a giant 165 Mtr height observation Wheel located in the heart of the Marina bay with my family on 26th August 2016.Climate was cloudy,gradually became sunny with rain droplets.Giant Wheel has 28 nos fully Air conditioned Glass Capsules(transparent ) with seating arrangement. 30 minutes journey in the Glass capsule with stunning daytime scenes was a great experience.From our capsule on the top of Singapore, we enjoyed views from Marina bay to Singapore river.we missed the Panoramic view that stretches to parts of Malyesia and Indonesia because of smoke coming from forests.We felt that both day and Night journey in the Wheel will be most enjoying. Night view of Singapore with Illuminated colourful lights will be more attractive
Drinking water,Eatables and wash room facilities are available.
Flier ticket price S$ 33/-Per Person",,,
,,Great way to see the city by day or night,5,,"We have done the Singapore flyer during the day time and during the night, both are well worth it. The trip takes about 30mins and the carriages are air conditioned, so it's a nice break from the heat. Seeing all the lights at night is spectacular, especially the Super trees in the gardens.",,,
,,Excellent,5,,Visit is a must for the spectacular views of the Singapore skyline. We choose the champagne your and was worth the extra money.,,,
,,Try it at night,3,,We visited the place in August 2016. The view from the top is great but you most go there at night. A little bit on the expensive though. Not value for money.,,,
,,Pleasant end to the trip,5,,The views of the city were breathtaking. We didn't have to queue for very long (10 mins max) and there are different packages available. We just did the standard admission and enjoyed every minute of seeing the city light up at night for our last night in Singapore.,,,
,,Great view,5,,"If you are in SIngapore, don't miss the opportunity to see it through this flyer. It's worth the visit for it's great unique experience.",,,
,,A ride on flyer is must in singapore,5,,Really Good as you can see the singapore. Views are more good in the evening time. Ride is comfortable.,,,
,,Loved it!,5,,"We took a 24 hrs bus pass with Hippo and Duck tours, and went to Flyer first thing in the morning. Great experience. No crowds early morning. It took about an hour all together with q and tickets, and getting through a mini museum/interactive area. Cabins are very safe and staff would not allow to over crowd",,,
,,MERRY GO ROUND,2,,Not worth to visit. 脢xpensive and boring. Weather is hot in Singapore and with the recent haze.... you may not be able to see far.,,,
,,Excellent view!,5,,"Slowly make your way up and enjoy panoramic view Singapore has to offer. You get clear view of the bay, the Marina Barrage, and the city view. We went up there during daytime, the next time we go there we plan to be there at night, which should be just as awesome.",,,
,,Better at night,5,,"Well worth the ride but better at night , nice easy smooth ride capsule holds 28 people we had 4 great to move around and get pictures from every angle",,,
,,Best venue to watch F1,5,,"As F1 season is coming, do visit this attraction to enjoy the buzzle of the F1 season in Singapore which happens annually. Many restaurants to choose from, convenient by public transport.",,,
,,Best location for a birds eye view on Singapore's waterfront,4,,"We took the Singapore Flyer after our dinner at the Food Street located at the bottom which was convenient. The multi storey car park was across the street and was connected to the flyer via an overhead bridge.

We took the flight at around 8:30 pm. It was not crowded and the night scene was ok. We prefer the day time scene (we visited several years ago) as we could see more and further.
Overall, it was a pleasant and good experience.",,,
,,Top view,5,,"This cost $33A but the views are great and you get a great Birdseye view of overall Singapore. A different perspective either day or night, if you were to go on sunset you would get the best of both worlds (but maybe one more than another) lots of photo opportunities and you can move freely about the capsule. Trip takes roughly 30mins. Taxi takes you straight to the door or walking distance from many hotels.",,,
,,Great ride with great view!,5,,"This visit was the first for my 3-year-old. It was a weekday and we had to share the cabin with 2 other passengers, so the ride was very relaxing and enjoyable. An attraction i'm very proud of as a Singaporean. A must to visit for all tourists.",,,
,,See the sights from up high,4,,Not too badly priced at $35 per adult. Took about 30 min to do a loop. Good way to see the city and pin point places of interest,,,
,,Great attraction if you can get a good deal,3,,"We went on this around sunset time and it was lovely. I think the pricing is a bit much for a couple but we were lucky to have a voucher. The views are good and it's a great way to see more of the city. The other options for added extras like drinks or meals looked great. They don't seem to overfill the carriages so everyone gets a chance to enjoy the view. I wouldn't pay full price, but I would go again!",,,
,,Great views,5,,Takes about sixty minutes to go around. Great sights of Singapore. You can see the Formula One pit lane.,,,
,,Nice 360 degree aerial view,4,,"The only place to get a 360 degree aerial view of Singapore, this is a ""must do"" in my books. From ticket purchase to the trip, it's a smooth and easy process... I have been a handful of times and never had to wait more than 10min.

My suggestion would be to do it around sunset, so you get the best light and see the lights starting to come on in the city.

I have only ever used the Singapore Airline Stopover package, so get a free ride on the Flyer.",,,
,,Must take this ride,5,,I would suggest that one must take this ride. Its the best way to see the spectacle of Singapore. Best time: After Sunset,,,
,,A must!,5,,"Worth it for the fabulous views of Singapore. Lasts half an hour, and is close to other attractions.",,,
,,Good thing to do,5,,"It's a tourist attraction and you have to do
it. We got on really quick and it takes sounds 30 minutes altogether to go around. Good view of the F1 track and the gardens. A strange place to put the wheel but easy to get to on the metro",,,
,,Tour of Singapore flyer,4,,"Overall it was an enjoyable ride to see the Marina & city. We booked this in advance on 8/22 & got confirmation. Before our trip to Singapore, our booking was planned for the last time slot ride on 9/4 @ 7:30pm (Sunday) to catch the sunset or evening lights. On 9/1 we received an email that the ride/tour was completely sold out & had to choose another time for that day, next available times lot was 6pm. Not ideal...

Liuda Tours must be the company that gives you your e-voucher, at an office around the corner of the Singapore flyer entrance. My only complaint was that they didnt seem to organized.

We arrived 15 mins early and was told to wait till they called our time, 6pm. Once they did... It was approx 60 other people in this time slot, and we had to form a line outside for them to count how many people were in this group. Given this was an extremely hot & muggy day standing outside with no A/C and in the sun was very uncomfortable.

They must have recounted the line several times, as more later people arrived and joined the line. It was approx 15 mins later before we move to the Singapore flyer entrance. We didnt realize this was a group tour to a ride.

I think it would have been faster if we just purchase the Singapore flyer ticket at the ticket counter, and be on the ride faster...since there was no lines...perhaps the cost of buying at the counter may be a few dollars more...

Overall the ride was nice & great view of the Marina & city, It is approx 30 mins long and each capsule has A/C and comfortable. Glad our capsule was not filled to the max capacity.",,,
,,Impressive views of the area,4,,"This attraction is very similar to the other large scale ferris wheels. Total trip time is about 30 minutes. Ascent/descent are slow so no one should be alarmed by the movement. Plenty of room in the carriage and it was not crowded when I went. After you hit the peak though, its about 15 minutes of dead time waiting to get off but still worth exploring. There are other options - a dinner venue, etc. but I did not try any of those.",,,
,,Over the top view,4,,It's a giant revolving wheel like the London eye. You get a superb birds eye over the top view of Singapore. The formula 1 grand pre circuit is just below it. Nice experience,,,
,,What a view!,5,,"The views of Singapore and surrounding areas is magnificent from the over large Ferris wheel. Easy to access, quiet and very safe, this is a must in Singapore to give you a birds eye view of the city.",,,
,,On lunch!!,1,,"Extremely bad service and every time you go to collect your tickets they are ""on lunch"" missed out a full day of our 5 days pass because of the staff being ""on lunch"". And they are on linch for more than an hour in all three airport terminals at one - how in a service industry are they all on lunch at once - terrible singapore service!! Bringing down the tourism industry",,,
,,So much fun.... Great views... Go early.,5,,We went quite early to this and had the cabin to ourselves. The view was spectacular and the trip was just perfect taking 35 minutes for a full circuit. Have a great time on it.,,,
,,Extensive Views,4,,"Amazing ride on the Singapore Flyer. A very gentle pace, with no real perception of moving. Fantastic way to get an overview of the city. Great views of the Marina, Gardens on the Bay and the downtown core.",,,
,,Amazing view!!,5,,You can enjoy this wonderful view in the day or night. The attraction last 30 min. Views of the city are spectacular.,,,
,,Lovely for All,5,,"This attraction was beautiful from the journey on the streets to get to it to the final moments before the trip ended. I went on my on, and everyone fits in in a beautiful way. Great attraction from couples, singles, and family because the sights a simply LOVELY and a must do when visiting!",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"Good value for money, what a amazing view of Singapore. About half an hour for the trip but plenty of time to enjoy the view.",,,
,,Had an entire car to ourselves.,4,,"We lucked out and had an entire car to ourselves which was nice. I enjoyed the view from the london eye better, but was cramped in with a lot of people competing for pictures. The shop also has reasonable prices on souvenirs, which are surprisingly hard to find in singapore even though there are 982 malls there. There is also an eating area that is really nice looking. We had already eaten but wished we hadn't. If you go mid morning you may have a decent chance to be alone in a car.",,,
,,Amazing view of the City,5,,It was an amazing experience to ride this with a group of 10-12 people. Ticket cost was S$33. Not sure if this is the right price or our travel guide charged us more or less. Almost the entire country could be seen from the flyer.,,,
,,Boooring!!,2,,Boring typical way to get a mediocre view of Singapore. Better off to go to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark (observation deck). You will get a better and more comprehensive view of Singapore.,,,
,,Great views of Bay Area,5,,"We decided to hop off the HIPPO bus at the flyer to have a look and ended up buying tickets.

The weather was not too good as had been raining during the day and rather cloudy still. Glad we decided too though as the views were amazing (I can imagine how much better they would have been on a clear day).

The speed of the wheel gave you plenty of time to take in all the views from Marina Sands, the new financial district, the bay precinct, gardens and to our delight the setting up of the track for the upcoming Grand Prix.

The timing of the rotation 60minutes and a stop for ice cream from one of many food options at entrance our HIPPO bus was just arriving to continue our trip.",,,
,,Beautiful View,5,,"good to see Singapore by night, Take a VIP cabin Nice view to the Harbour, Formula 1 racing trac, and the Marina Bay Building",,,
,,Okok,3,,"For someone who lives in a high rise building, this is not much of a attraction place to be visited. But, even if one wishes to go, best if gone during night to see the night life and good photos.",,,
,,World's Largest Ferris Wheel,3,,"At a height of 165 m, the Singapore Flyer is billed as the world's largest Ferris wheel, although I understand the Chinese are building one that will outstrip it.

From the top you command 360 degree views over Singapore island, including across the Straits of Jahor to Malaysia, and over Singapore City itself.

The Flyer operates from 8.30 am to 10 pm. It costs S$33 and the senior's concession is only available to Singapore residents.",,,
,,Another great attraction at the Lion City :),5,,Great panoramic view of the City. Hope you can time your visit to avoid heavy rain storm. It could ruin the experience.,,,
,,One of the attraction you should go at least once~,4,,"Like what is in the title of my review, 'you should go at least once' :D
The scenery is awesome be it in the day or at night.
Personally, I feel that going up on the Flyer around 6-ish (between 18:30-19:00hours, *you might want to check the sunset timing on the internet for more accurate information) in the evening would be the best timing as you get to see both day and night...
Erm, try to get there earlier especially during weekends in case of long queue.
There are also quite a number of shops, eateries around the area. If you want something special, you might want to try their Premium Sky Dining Flight. It's a whole different experience!
The area around Flyer (you can walk to MBS/ Gardens by the bay) is pretty big, so perhaps spend a day there and just enjoy yourself!!! ;)",,,
,,Great experience,3,,The wheel is moving slowly and doesn't stop to pick up people. Getting off also the same. the full journey takes about 20-30mins and you can see Singapore from the sky!,,,
,,Visit,5,,Partner booked for drinks and ride on flyer. Got on to pod 13 to a couple of waiter's serving our drink the pod was amazing the views off the flyer are brilliant .week before grand prix could see all the work going on and the pits .ride lasted about 30 mins. a must trip to do while in Singapore,,,
,,Great views we all enjoyed,5,,Went on the Singapore flyer during the day to see the view did toss up weather it would be better of a night time? Ride was good nice and smooth with a great view of the Gardens and Marina Bay but costly with a family of 4 for a 30 minute trip.,,,
,,It's great,5,,This flyer is great and it takes you in a journey over the Singapore city. The duration about 25 mins. It's wonderful to visit it at night,,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,"We visited at morning and it was so good to see the city from that height. View is very good and quite enjoyable ride , that too if u get complete cell of your own like we got :D",,,
,,Well worth doing,5,,"Another city another big wheel, but you got to do it, great views of the city and harbour, when we were there they were setting up the Grand Prix circuit, which added another interest.",,,
,,nice view,4,,"in the low season chances are high you'll be alone in the backet, which is nice - no need to pay more for that",,,
,,Spectacular views of Singapore,4,,Relaxing way to spend a visual overview of Singapore. Interesting video to accompany the sights as you re guided through the landscapes and architecture. We were fortunate not to have to queue and walked straight on to our X capsule to board. A wonderful experience .,,,
,,Good way to enjoy the beautiful architecture of Singapore!,4,,"As in London and other cities, you can nice view of the city.

The flyer is more than just a Ferris wheel; there are a few fun attractions at the base, including a shaded garden and a fish pond.

Unfortunately, you have to go through a lot of dull exposition on your ascent to the flyer entrance, but in the end, the view is worth it.",,,
,,Great experience,4,,Ok I live 10 minutes from the London Eye so wasn't super keen to go on this but I was wrong. No queue - perfect Singaporean organisation and a great way to see Singapore !,,,
,,A view from the top,5,,"The view form this is only surreal. Great for families, corporate & regular tourists. If you don't have time to see the city in its entirety, then this is a must!",,,
,,For Me Travelling and Exploring New Places Includes Getting A Fresh New Perspective,4,,"11APR14 And a fresh new perspective of a very flat, very hot country is from an air-conditioned booth slowly rising above the city below. The views were fabulous and the company (one other couple) was memorable. I love at ground level how an engineering feat such as this gets integrated so seamlessly with it's surroundings. It was a great way to start another sightseeing day by foot as the time in the Flyer allowed us to familiarise ourselves by sight where we were about to walk to.",,,
,,On top of Singapore,4,,"Beautiful 360 Birds eye view of the whole city. The whole rotation takes about 20-25 minutes, you can just relax and enjoy the view from here after a whole lot of walking. After sun down you even get to see the gardens by the bay light show from here. Must do in Singapore.",,,
,,Great view the iconic and amazing new building of Singapore,4,,Great view the iconic and amazing new building of Singapore. Not as boring as I thought it would be! Fantastic near 720 degree views. Super efficient as to be expected of Singapore.,,,
,,Best views of Singapore,5,,It is a very nice way to see the Singapore skyline. You can definitely take good pictures from up there - pictures you otherwise couldn't take unless you were on a helicopter. The entire ride takes 30 minutes. It is quite leisurely. Very similar to the London Eye.,,,
,,Best Views!,5,,I must that a trip on the Flyer is worth the 30 minutes it takes to cycle. The views are amazing. We had the car or cabin to ourselves. The wheel moves so slowly you really cannot feel it. There's no jerking or noises to make you nervous. This is a great opportunity to take photos all over the city. It's reachable via Hop on/Hop off bus routes. It's a great down time break. It's also a nice way to get a feel for the city.,,,
,,Just like london eye,5,,"It was nice, it becomes economical if you combine this ticket with hop off and hop on tour. Alone it becomes expensive",,,
,,Beautifull view,4,,From Singapore Flyer lyou can see all side off Singapore. Me and my friends weren't waiting for a long time to take the Flyer gondola. And it was very good. Maybe there are missing some historical buildings to improve experience.,,,
,,Great views of city,4,,Lovely modern ferris wheel with each unit being a separate capsule. Clean and safe. Great for families and little kids. Expensive - but it is Singapore. Excellent vies of the city.,,,
,,Superb,5,,"Tremendous views over Singapores marina bay and lucky enough to see the grand prix starting grid being set up. We did the Singapore sling ride and had a whole pod to ourselves, do it and you won't be disappointed. A must thing to do as the ride lasts well over 30 minutes. Take note London Eye, this is how it should be done!",,,
,,Breath taking,5,,My parents booked this as a treat for my 18th birthday. We had a private cabin and we were given a Singapore Sling to enjoy on the way round. The views of the city were amazing and I'd recommend getting a private cabin so you can enjoy it even more. Staff are very friendly and efficient!,,,
,,Lovely View of the City and across to Malaysia,3,,This slow moving glass ferris wheel is perfect for those looking at viewing all aspects over Singapore. It is a little expensive but the ride is slow allowing for the view to be completely optimised. Little ones can get a bit over it but if you are travelling with little ones/ or big ones who like to move around ask for a carriage on your own this way the can walk around as much as they like without disturbing anyone.,,,
,,Spectacular views at night,5,,"We went on the Singapore Flyer at night, and we were thrilled to see the amazing views from the Flyer.
They offer many different flight options, some of them including dinner, and drinks while on the Flyer.
I would highly recommend visiting the Singapore Flyer at night, with all the lights shining from the city, the Gardens-by-the-bay, and the Marina Bay Sands.",,,
,,Heartbreaking,5,,"Ride on singapore flyer was amazing and heartbreaking, the view from 90 degree top is breathtaking. The view is so mesmerising that one cannot take away eyes. Specially when u ride in evening with lighting all over.",,,
,,Meh,3,,"If you've been on the London Eye, it is pretty much the same thing. There were no queues when we visited so were able to get right on. Nice night views if the city on a 30 min ride.",,,
,,Great views,4,,Only 10 people shared our air conditioned pod on the Singapore Flyer but twice as many could have fitted in quite comfortably. Great views over Singapore with a gift shop at the exit. A few fast food places were on site.,,,
,,Singapore is beautiful,5,,"We went on the flyer in the evening, what a lovely way to see the Singapore skyline and absorb the beautiful architecture",,,
,,Singapore flyer - great views,4,,Don't miss tourist attraction. Great views financial district and sea side. Go during the evenings for amazing lighting Whole ride is about 30-35 mins Well spacious pods. We got one just for our family (4 members ),,,
,,Looks pretty from far but far from pretty,3,,Iconic masterpiece defining the skyline of singapore. Appreciate the presence of it amongst our skyline. But is it worth it to pay for a visit? View up there isn't too pretty. View of singapore port.,,,
,,"A waste of time, IMO",3,,"Went there and was sooooo bored. It takes a lifetime for it to make one revolution. One can have a meal there but I cannot imagine doing that. The first and only attraction here we did not like/appreciate, but then there was a line so many people obviously do.",,,
,,Nice but expensive,4,,You can have a bird's eye view of the entire city in half an hour. The entire rotation take 28 minutes and you can see entire city from inside. It is a wonderful experience if you have some extra dollars to shell out for. It looks beautiful in the evening with all lights around but you can be inside at any point of the day.,,,
,,Enjoying downtown Singapore from the top!,3,,"This is one of iconic things to do in downtown Singapore (beside Merlion statue and Marina Bay Sands). Kind of reminding me about the London Eye, pretty similar. You will have a different experience by looking the city from the top.

Amazing view

Lil bit pricey",,,
,,Must do!,5,,"This half an hour ride is absolutely breathtaking.An unmissable thing of the city.Along with the ride,there are really good restaurants here n gift shops :D",,,
,,Just Awesome!,5,,You must ride to have an experience of the same. Singapore view and Sea view is just awesomely visible.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,3,,"You cannot visit Singapore without going on the Flyer. Nice experience, even if the cabins are too crowded (no seats for everyone) and if you go by night the internal lights are too bright to let you take good pictures of the breathtaking views.",,,
,,Fantastic View,5,,Have been on a few of these in different cities and this is definitely up there with the best of them. The views are fantastic in all directions. Highly recommend.,,,
,,Singapore At Night,5,,"I highly recommend to take the Singapore Flyer at night. Roads and buildings all lit up, cars drifting through the highways, and everything just looks so calm and relaxing. It also feels cool up there because of course, Mister Sun is already sleeping.",,,
,,Great Views,5,,Great views of Marina Bay and the F1 circuit - you won't be disappointed - I would recommend going just before sunset....,,,
,,A birds eye view of singapore,4,,"We booked the flyer online and proceeded to the singapore flyer. We were asked to wait until it was 15 minutes before the scheduled ride time and then we're escorted to the upper deck to board the flyer. Like many things in singapore this too is planned out and designed well. We walked through a beautiful pathway with photo opportunities and boarded a large viewing pod.
This is not a great activity if you are afraid of heights...but if you are worried about the speed or feeling dizzy that does not happen as the pods move at a very slow speed so that you can hardly feel that you are moving. We selected the 18.30 time slot as the 7pm (last ride) was unavailable. It was beautiful to see the sun setting and we had a great view of gardens by the bay, marina bay sands etc...especially once they were lit up after sunset. This is a great activity to relax and take in the breath taking view of singapore from far above.",,,
,,My first experience of such kind !,5,,I bought the tourist attraction pass through Viator trip advisor ! Its lifetime experience one can get ! You can see whole city through this ! Very near to Marina bay sands !!,,,
,,Very nice,5,,his is a beautiful attraction. One turn takes about 22 minutes and you have a wonderful vieuw over the city en the harbour. You can have diner in this attraction.,,,
,,Peaceful Gateaway,5,,"I went with a friend from Shaghai. After the crazy outings in Singapore, we finally got to chill in our own cabin around 8pm. It's a great place to have a breather, above the noisy streets you'll get to see the beautifully lighted up city :)",,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,Well worth the $33 dollar fare. Amazing views of Singapore from the pod. Very efficiently run and interesting pre flight information,,,
,,Must visit for once,4,,"It's lik a huge giant wheel ! Lik really huge n u get a birds eye view of the entire city!can visit t once. Perfect ride fa picturesque photos of d city. Wit d flyer moving at a snail's pace, u get ample of time for capturing the many scyscrapers in the place. Don forget to buy the passport cover at the flyer shop at the exit- I found t cheap plus d cover was really cute:)",,,
,,What a view,5,,"We went mid morning, without a reservation! There was no queue at all. Wonderful views all around, recommend going in day light!",,,
,,A must try,4,,You must go on this flyer to enjoy the beautiful 360 degree view of the city. Very comfortable to get onto it with kids. It moves very slow so no nausea related issues. It is pretty expensive though.,,,
,,View from the top,4,,"A place where you can view the Bay sights that Singapore has to offer

The Esplanade, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands are all visible. We took the ride at night and the Singapore skyline looked just majestic.

It takes 30 minutes for the ride to complete.
Entry tickets were priced at S$33.0 The complex has a small forest in the atrium, complete with a waterfall and fish area. There are restaurants, coffee and juice shops as well

Overall, a treat",,,
,,Nice,4,,"Good Experience........., View is great from top, must do , while in Singapore ofcourse.........no que and waiting time, u jst have to go",,,
,,Amazing view,5,,I had a great experience.360 full view and singapore F1 track next to you. There is a many restaurant and selling shops .that is is a safe fly...,,,
,,First experience on a revolving observation wheel,5,,"I was a bit apprehensive while getting into the flyer at first,my only consolation was that we were a group of about twenty people.The trip round was slow and un eventful and i soon found myself taking lots of photos for memories.At the end of it all ,i was more excited at the feat than fearful.Its a good experience no Adrenalin.",,,
,,Stunning views,5,,My family and i enjoyed this attraction immensely. Thankfully the wait was very short on what was quite a hot and humid day.,,,
,,Bigger than London Eye,5,,"Spectacular views for the lovely city of Singapore . You will definitely take some memorable pictures from there. Although it is bigger than London Eye but at the same time it is slower, so you will enjoy every second.",,,
,,Singapore from the sky,4,,"Little bit taller then Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the Singapore Flyer offers you the possibility to observe singapore from 156 m above see level. Nice view on Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay, the Docks, the old and new city.

The round takes haf an hour so you can also have rest in sunny day. I suppose the best is at sunset hours",,,
,,Scenic ride,5,,"One cannot pass up the opportunity to view the best part of the City. This ride is very efucational, relaxing and rewarding photo opportunity.
Been on this ride day time (July 2016) and night time (August 2016). They are equally worth doing.
I wish the staff/crew would make sure the plexiglass walls are smudge free for better photos and/or videos. Otherwise, bring your own windex wipes for crispier photos!",,,
,,Good view,4,,Hi I really lived the flyer. I had booked with city tours and when I was on the flyer I could see the beautiful view or the city and the best part is that you go during night you can see lights it's awsum,,,
,,Good way to see above Singapore,4,,"This is literally as you would expect, you go on around the wheel slowly able to see Singapore. It was good views and we were impressed that they didn't cram many people in with us so we could see the full 360 views. It does go quite slowly so allow a but of time.",,,
,,Well worth going on,5,,"I wasn't too keen about going on the Singapore Flyer because it goes so high BUT it was FANTASTIC. I'm so glad I went. I felt really safe in the enclosed pod. They are spacious and the views you get are amazing. It takes half an hour and moves slowly that you don't even realise you are moving. If you are thinking about going on it, make sure you do.",,,
,,Good Views,3,,Good Views of the Grand Prix Circuit and of Gardens by the Bay. Moves at a decent pace and due to the pods being quite large there is plenty of space for everyone even if the pod is at full capacity.,,,
,,Incredible 360 Degree View of Singapore,4,,"The Singapore flyer was pretty expensive but worth it as you get a 360 degree view of Singapore. The flyer goes around pretty slow in order for people to see the views and such. No food or drink was allowed.
In my opinion, I think that the flyer got boring after a while, it would be interesting if they added some tablets with some interactive games for children or maybe some information about the buildings in Singapore. Apart from that, the views were incredible and I really enjoyed viewing the beautiful buildings of Singapore.",,,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,"Loved this. It is very stable, you do not feel it moving at all. The view is outstanding. A better map in the capsule would help to identify the less obvious places.",,,
,,All of Singapore from the Top,4,,"I was so scared to get into the flyer and was pushed to ride it by my sister, and coz my son wanted to ride it too. I didnt want him to be influenced by my negative thoughts and fear from heights, so i went in praying not to faint when it starts moving. I was surprised that i actually liked it ( although it is really high and takes about 30 mins to complete a full cycle) it stays stand still; it doesnt move same as the telephreak (cable cars) and it is quite big ( can have more that 20 persons.

The only thing i think would he nice to have is a guide to talk breofly about the places and main spots you see from up there ( there are photos hanged with places' names) but would be better to have a guide to tell you where to look to spot the place shown in the pictures.

Great experience for me",,,
,,Great view,3,,"At the top of the Flyers one can see all surrounding islands ,including Malyasia a Indonesia,Given the size of Singapore the flyer give travelled anoverall view of Singapore!",,,
,,A Special Dinner,4,,"My dearest booked a whole cabin to celebrate our anniversary for 2 hours which was a memorable experience to me.

The view was spectacular which I could observe the infamous Marina Bay Sand complex, CBD and Garden by Bay. It was very worth for tourists to have a chance to experience while the ticket is not very much expensive if you decide to join with others.",,,
,,Great view of citt,4,,"The surrounding area leading to the Singapore Flyer is very quiet. The Flyer is too far from the Marina Shopping cluster to be considered near. It's one of those too far to be near but too near to be far. If you took a cab from Marina Square, you'd get out in less than 5 minutes!

We visited the Flyer at night. There wasn't any crowd at all and I felt sorry for the people whose job was to take your picture before you board in the hopes of you buying a photograph as a souvenir per chance after your ride.

The rotation is slow - so if you have the good luck of being stuck in the cabin with a noisy 8 year old who couldn't stop talking and parents who didn't care to stop him but were madly taking photos of him with the Singapore night scene for a backdrop- you are in for one looooong ride!

I read that the Flyer can set you up with dinner in a private cabin - idea for a romantic proposal!

The views are breathtaking for the first 5 mins..... then you'd be wondering how long is the ride gonna take.....",,,
,,18th Birthday Celebration,5,,We booked the VIP package with Singapore Sling cocktails. They did treat us like VIPs great!! What an experience! We all loved this. Fantastic views of Singapore.,,,
,,Fab views,4,,Great chance to see parts of Singapore from a very different angle. You get to understand the different villages that make up Singapore. The flyer also gives you a great view of the F1 course.,,,
,,"nice view, reserve for a dinner!",4,,"nice view, reserve for a dinner! this is very large, but very slow too.. you may have a meal inside flyer (if you book it in advance.)",,,
,,Great view!,4,,"Great view, this is very similar to the London Eye. You can however just go up tower 3 in Marina Bay Sands to the 57th floor .... The view is fab but couldn't look down!!

You get a great view of the overhang of the MBS from the flyer it's so curved you can't see that from below!!

Good valve tourist attraction",,,
,,Great Flyer,5,,The first thing we did in Singapore and we enjoyed it a lot. It is not cheap but worth it. You really enjoy a nice view of Singapore. Recommended.,,,
,,FANTASTIC,5,,takes about 45 mins i think. and it goes slwoly so noone falls each capsule can accomodate about ummm dozen or more people and in centre is a sitting area also.but best is to stand and go around it and see singapore from different angles,,,
,,Weekend in Singapore,5,,"Who does not like a great big ferris wheel?
Stunning views up and down the coast and over the over the spectacular skyline of Singapore. The air conditioned capsule which we shared with some ladies from China and their daughters made for easy viewing and the time seemed to just fly by. Excellent experience must try it at night.",,,
,,Interesting,4,,"On a clear day this gives you a great view of Singapore, it moves slow enough for you to take it all in",,,
,,Bird's eye view of the city!,4,,"If you wish to have a bird's eye view of the city and spend around 20-30 minutes doing nothing but stare at the tiny people below, then this is the place to be :)",,,
,,Ferris wheel,4,,"Its a bit of a walk away from other attractions so a short taxi ride brings you to the entrance
There are a few restaurants here the tkt booth is just ahead to the right
The walk upto the 2nd floor is interesting and once passed the check in you have a display of facts to keep you busy as you walk around in the queue
We were lucky we had a short queue and it wasn't crowded in the capsule
It goes round very very slowly so you cant tell its moving
The views are amazing well worth a visit
You can book a pod for a private meal",,,
,,Go at night for best views,4,,"We received a gift voucher to go on the flyer from some friends as a wedding present.
The whole experience was very good- we shared our pod with around 12 other people and went at 7pm. The city lights made for a fantastic view and the length of the ride was just right.

Definitely a good attraction to visit whilst in Singapore.",,,
,,Unique experience,4,,A unique experience to see Singapore from above. The big ferris wheel turns around slowly so you won't really feel you are moving.,,,
,,Hypedup and overpriced,3,,Mid-way through the journey one almost felt like reading a book. One of the many over hyped attractions in SG. Not the fault of the flyer as this is what its format is - Maybe one can try to book an exclusive cabin and of course have an exclusive company to enjoy! ;),,,
,,Great city views,4,,A peaceful journey in the air-conditioned capsule gives a great view and time to relax and appreciate the skyline of Singapore. Make sure you check out the Koi pond under the wheel.,,,
,,Got to pick you time to ride,4,,The time of day is important when you visit as there can to many people Once around is enough get a sit,,,
,,"Nice place, good views.",4,,Liked the views from the top. Its not scary from inside as it looks from outside. Pretty good views of singapore from there.,,,
,,Flyer is huge....bigger than that in London,5,,Flyer is safe. It takes 33 minutes to complete one round. In a day the flyer works only 38 rounds. The view is amazing...you can see Indonesian island too. Must visit.,,,
,,Really awesome view of Singapore and all the buildings,3,,"I saw all the buildings in singapore and thought of all the wonderful people working inside. It's great to be in a business minded city like singapore, everyone is rushing but you're on a ferriswheel having fun.",,,
,,Spectacular views,4,,"We went off peak and had the whole cabin to ourselves allowing us freedom of movement to view from every angle, I highly recommend this either night or day and on a clear day you can see across the water to Indonesia plus look at the amazing array of ships anchored off Singapore then across the city skyline.",,,
,,You Gotta Try It,4,,"We had to ride the Flyer, and we're not disappointed. Now, if only they had kid-friendly gondolas and adult gondolas... We had a crying child and a father who hit her. Not good. Great scenery! Great photography. Spectacular skyline.",,,
,,Excellent views of Singapore's lights!,4,,We enjoyed our 3o minutes here thoroughly taking in the beautiful views of the city's evening lights. Recommend timing your visit to start around twilight so that you get both daylight views and evening lights within the 30 mins that you have.,,,
,,Good views but very slow,2,,"I can understand that it's slow for a lot of reasons, BUT it's boring and you finished feeling anxiety!! The capsule was FULL of people!! Bad experience, but amazing views!",,,
,,Best if you can ride it,5,,We rode the singapore flyer and it was an awesome experience. The trip took around 1hour and provided ecstatic view of Singapore and the coastal area.,,,
,,A bird view!,5,,You could see the entire city! It's beautiful! Tip: After the ride on the flyer you could get a Duck Tour too. The bookings can be made near the entrance.,,,
,,The most beautiful view of Singapore!,5,,"It's a 30 minute ride. We walked from the helix bridge , caught a quick glimpse of gardens by the bay and walked to the flyer over the beautiful bridge.

It's best after dark. The ticket was about 33$. Not much queue on a Sunday evening. But the queue did build. So make sure to be there just at sunset.",,,
,,Interesting exprince,4,,Rode the Singapore Flyer and the compartment we were in had only three couples in it. This gave us room to move around and get good vantage points of the the scenery. The speed with which the wheel rotates is accommodating and gives you plenty of time to take in the sights. You can appreciate different sections of Singapore and get a real appreciation of what it has to offer. I would recommend experiencing the Singapore Flyer to anyone visiting Singapore. A pleasant experience.,,,
,,great view of bay of gardens and the city,4,,Lovely views across Singapore including harbour and the Marina Bay hotel etc. Care is scared of heights although takes half an hour to complete ride. Slightly overpriced hence 4 stars but worth while. Alternatively you can pay to go up the top of the Marina Bay hotel but this wouldn't give you 360掳 views. Each capsule can take 28people so you are with strangers but we only had 12 in ours so it's not ram packed with people.,,,
,,A floating room with a view!,5,,"This was an incredible experience as long as you are not afraid of heights! The view from the Flyer is AMAZING! Look out over Gardens By the Bay, see some incredible architecture or simply watch the world go by beneath you.",,,
,,beautiful view,3,,"no matter what time of day you go you will see the beautiful view but of course it's prettier at night with the lights. it's about a 30 min ride and goes slow enough.

it was a little more than i would like to spend but you might get a discount of is you show them your boarding pass. not sure if that applies to all airlines but it worked with us.",,,
,,An absolute must do!!!,5,,"This was my second visit to The Singapore Flyer but the first time I have paid the extra $$ for the Singapore Sling ride. I don't want to spoil the experience for anyone so all I will say is you are in for quite the treat! There were just 7 of us (3 separate groups) in the pod which meant we had incredible views regardless of where we stood in the pod, no strangers in our photos & we socialised with one another and truly had the greatest time. I cannot recommend highly enough, a must do! A true V.I.P. experience.",,,
,,Worth visiting,5,,It's our 4th time to vist Singapore but the 1st time to try the Singapore flyer and definitely worth the bucks. Suggest to visit during sunset or night time as the view are stunning,,,
,,360 degree view of Singapore,5,,Take in the amazing view of Singapore horizons and spend time talking about life. Great to take you mind off at height and enjoy the Singapore landscape.,,,
,,"Wow worth every penny, great views.",5,,"We went on the flyer as a family of four using the Singapore five day ultimate pass. We had a great time as there was a lot of interesting info to look at on the way in all about the history and how the flyer was constructed. We had to share our 28 man pod with two other people, which was fine as they are so big.
The whole ride lasted approx 35 mins. And afterwards there are lots of places below the flyer to get a drink or a snack. My teenage kids loved it and would highly recommend
This trip.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"We have done the Flyer twice, once in the daytime where the views are amazing. We also had an amazing evening where we had dinner on board in the evening. The scenery is amazing. Seeing all the lights in the surrounding buildings and the river. The staff are very helpful",,,
,,A Must Visit Place,5,,"I have been to Singapore couple of times and on my first visit in 2015 we stayed quite close to the Flyer and one day we strolled towards it, wasn't that crowded so were able to get a ticket without any hassle and enjoy the experience of having a birds eye view of Singapore.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,Loved every moment of the flyer ride. It moves so slowly that you enjoy to see and enjoy every view of the ocean and Singapore. Kids enjoyed the flyer ride and walked inside the capsule comfortably.,,,
,,Nice but just if nothing else left to explore,3,,Had a ok ok experience... May be because we had a better view from our hotel room at Ritz馃槃...surely gives you a good view of the Singapore Bay Area,,,
,,Nice views,4,,"Nice views, the tour is long enough to take enough pictures, but nothing exceptional. When we visited there were no queues, only few people in a cabin.",,,
,,Awesome views,4,,We went in the day which had awesome views but we did the river cruise at night and the lights on this wheel were amazing!!! Maybe the night time would be way better if you like the lights of the city.,,,
,,Good Choice To Visit Once,3,,"Walking into the place, the feeling is good. Clean and neat and ....good feeling of ""tourist attraction"". Good food around.
Up in the cabin, you get excitement of hanging high up in the air and get to look at Singapore skyline with a perspective. From high up in the cabin, you can see the beauty of Singapore city, coastline, key landmarks on the ground, and on a fair weather day, you can see the Batam Island of Indonesia clearly.
Recommendation: Good to visit once..... But .....if you ask me, honestly, up there on the Marina Bay Skypark next door could get an even better view, except you do not get the experience of the flyer ride.",,,
,,Nice,4,,Good for something to do for a couple of hours nice food court before you go up and great views from the flyer. Plenty of space inside and aircon. We walked from there over the bridge to the gardens.,,,
,,Only for a quick dinner date,3,,Make sure you spare 30 min and book a whole cabin topped with a meal. Only then will you maximise your enjoyment of this attraction. Keep your eyes peeled towards Sentosa island for stunning views of Singapore's southern end. The Gardens By the Bay looks like a fairyland - charming with the Super trees towering over the two spectacular conservatories and other lovely spots to next explore once you get off the Flyer!,,,
,,Les on the Singapore Flyer,5,,"Perfectly presented from the moment you climb aboard.Clean, moves slowly, not scary and certainly a view to behold.",,,
,,Absolutely awesome,5,,"Thoroughly recommend this attraction, Great views if you're not afraid of heights. An absolute must do as well as have a look at the bay and go to Sentosa Island.",,,
,,Brilliant virws,5,,Did the flyer at dusk. It gives fantastic views of Singapore and well worth the price Queues were ok but you queue everywhere in Singapore ! Well run on and off in about half an hour,,,
,,Great views!,5,,"Lovely views from the top, takes a while to get around so you have plenty of time for photos. Not a huge amount of places to dine before hand, a couple but pays to eat before hand",,,
,,Fantastic and awesome view up there in Flyer cars.,5,,Wow. You can see the whole city and all marina bay from up there. It is really heart breaking views and photos takers shouldn't miss. The car is spacious and you can stand and set while taken pictures from all sides.,,,
,,Interesting but a little slow,4,,"We went on the flyer with very active 5yo and 2yos. It was fun to do, the views were of course amazing but both children were complaining of boredom a while before the end of the ride.",,,
,,Not so exciting,2,,Beginning was a good ride but for half hour for 1 round i think its bit too slow. Our visitors fm overseas looks bored.,,,
,,One time visit,3,,"Hi,

I had been to this place with family. It is not that great but good to visit once. It takes apprx 30 mins to complete the entire circle.
Recommended to visit around 7:30 pm or 8:30 pm so that you can view the light show at garden by the way from flyer.

Regards,
Prakash Matuwani",,,
,,Heights of excitement,5,,Fantastic experience. I booked the Singapore Sling flight and had the whole capsule to my self. Felt like a VVIP. Took the 7 30 pm slot. Awesome 30 minutes experience. Cannot describe in words. You have to be there in person to experience.,,,
,,Great ride,5,,"Great ride! Chill and clean cabins, awesome view of Singapore, there are some cool things to do as well as Flight Simulator etc",,,
,,It misses the charm and surroundings of London flyer,3,,Its a great place and gives a good view but singapore is not london..so the only thing you see is sky scrappers mostly build in last 10-15 years..thats were u remember london flyer ..,,,
,,Must go,5,,"Its worth the experience 360degree, amazing feeling, we went at 7pm, saw both in light and night view of singapore... bought super cheap tickets from KLOOK,",,,
,,Fantastic view,5,,"We went there around middle night. There was free fantastic fire work on the bay. The light was mingled with water, making a beatiful live show.",,,
,,Beautiful views of the city lights,5,,Enjoyed the slow motion of the wheel and the various views of the city lights. There was a bench in the middle of the car to sit and enjoy the sights or stand and take photos by the windows.,,,
,,Too slow,2,,This is an attraction that I don't understand. Unless you want to spend long time looking at Singapore from the Top. It's quite boring as it takes 30-40' to complete the ride...,,,
,,Nice view but ride is meant for kids below 8 or elderly over 80yrs,3,,"Spectacular views but you can go to any tall buildings and get to see same view. Ride bored me to death, literally. Ride will excite kids below 8 yrs old and maybe old folks over 80yrs of age. I will go for a 2nd ride when I turn 80.",,,
,,A step above the rest,5,,The journey in the Singapore Flyer allows one to capture an ever changing skyline over the city. Awesome light display.,,,
,,45 mins in this palce,4,,"what you need is 45mis to go around this ""Singapore eyes"" known as the flyers. you can see 20% of the city. will be excited for the first 5 to 10 minutes, then will be waiting eagerly to get off the cabseal.",,,
,,Night view at it's best.,5,,"The view from the Flyer is absolutely breathtaking. Perfect for friends and couples to enjoy. It only takes 30 minutes to make a revolution, and 10 of those minutes are spent getting to a decent view.",,,
,,360 view,4,,"Slow Ferris wheel but it does offer some good views of Singapore. If you are going near dusk you will be able to see the super tree lights which offer some wonderful backdrops for pictures. Price is about $30SD for a 30 minute ride, not cheap but something to do while in Singapore. I like the fact that the staff limit each car to about 15 people, you don't have to jostle for a photo and there is plenty of space to move around.",,,
,,Somewhat overrated.,5,,"Come ride this thing for, at least, the novelty of it. In a small city with plenty of hotels and rooftop bars to enjoy Singapore's skyline from, the Flyer hardly brings any new perspective to the casual touristic eye for the price of its ticket.",,,
,,Nice View,5,,Recommend at 18h so you could enjoy Singapore in 30 minutes during day and night time. Lucky if you get to have a nice sunset!,,,
,,Get the whole view of Singapore,5,,You get to see the whole of Singapore using the flyer.Catch a glimpse of nice and important attractions.,,,
,,Fantastic aerial view if an amazing city,5,,"Fantastic views of the city, especially the F1 grid and start! Definitely worth the price and was surprised how quickly the 45 mins went, amazing nit to be missed",,,
,,Felt like I was on the top of the world,4,,"It was a very beautiful experience. The cubicles were spacious and the movement of the flyer was very swift. It was not that trilling as I expected. Even it would comfort the aged people. When we reached the top, I felt like I could see the whole world below me. I was a very beautiful view, amazing... Do visit it to see the beauty of Singapore.. It was really a stupendofantabulous experience. :)",,,
,,Breath-taking view of the city,4,,"Take the flyer during the late evening for a 30mins ride that opens the entire city, bay area in front of you. Excellent views and a great experience. ""MUST VISIT' for your singapore trip",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Excellent views of the city, but it's a bit of a faff to walk to if you fancy a stroll and was a bit chaotic in terms of signage where to pick up pre booked tickets, but the whole experience was a lot of fun.

It's a great way to see the city - we did it at night which was good actually.",,,
,,A big hit with my kids!,5,,We went to the Singapore flyer the first day of our trip so we could see the city. We have a 5 attraction flexipass and allowed us to skip the lines for tickets. There is a special door to the right of the ticket counter you go into to use your card to get the tickets. We went on a weekday morning which I highly recommend to avoid long lines- we basically walked right through and had our own pod! The views are fantastic and it moved slowly enough that those afraid of heights or who have trouble with motion sickness will not be affected. A must do!,,,
,,Yeah but...,2,,"Okay it's an impressive structure but I went at night and there was little to see.

The pod was crowded and it is a tad boring. It's a bit cheaper than the London Eye and it feels an awful lot slower. I could always do without the obligatory picture to sell you.

This review should not put you off just a suggestion that you should go in daylight hours.

The viewing deck on the Marina Bay Sands hotel is way way better.",,,
,,Excellent tourist attraction,5,,"The views from the gondolas are breathtaking, you take in all the city of Singapore in a 30 min + rotation of the flyer. We did late afternoon early night and the changes in the skyline were magnificent. The gondolas are large and can accommodate up to 12 persons comfortably with 360* clear vision. The staff are very attentive and the very minor delays while waiting to board the gondolas is minimal. The site is clean with easy access by lifts for the elderly and disabled. The foodhall caters for every taste and is very reasonably priced. It is a must to see while in Singapore. Don,t forget to take you camera or you will miss out on taking some memorable photos or video,s og Singapore skyline.",,,
,,Another expeirience to remember,5,,"We arrived on site soon after the opening time, there was no queue not like there was an hour later. one rotation takes thirty minutes which with so much to view seemed like ten. The views are magnificeint, just don""t go without plenty of ""photoshot"" space. This is a must for any visitor",,,
,,Amazing views,4,,This is a must if you want to see the amazing skyline in Singapore. The capsules are huge and they do not pack them out so you can freely move around and take pictures and they are air conditioned. The views you get are incredible and you can see the f1 pit lane from the flyer. Great price for a wonderful ride.,,,
,,feel like on top of the world,4,,"initially hesitant to get into the flyer, all of it vanished once i got into it. very smooth ride, did not even feel like moving and for a person afraid of heights, it was a great experience feeling on top of the world. covers the complete round in approx 25-30 mins, coaches have seats as well in case you want to sit and take all in. the views are breath taking, many landmarks are visible from here, giving the whole view of SG.",,,
,,Slow but the scenery is Great!,3,,This is a must watch destination for everyone. Located in the popular tourist area of Marina Bay and surrounded by Many tourist attractions. The eateries there is expensive though and not recommended.,,,
,,"Rewarding trip, not to be missed.",4,,Great view all around the city. You can see the superb view of Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay areas. After the trip you can learn how to fly plane in an inbuilt cockpit within the same building.,,,
,,Excellent way to view Singapore from a Giant wheel.,5,,This wheel revolved very slowly - giving viewers an opportunity to see Singapore from some fantastic perspectives.,,,
,,Try it,4,,"That's wonderful thing to try, there you can see everything from up and it goes very slowly so you can have a look around you from each side",,,
,,Excellent View of the city,5,,"Excellent 360 degree city view, the weather was nice and we could catch a glimpse of all the major locations in Singapore",,,
,,Pleasant trip,3,,Gives you a good view of the city skyline on one side and the bay and river mouth in the other side. Tickets are a bit pricy the city map that we got from the hotel had a 10% off voucher printed on it that they accepted. So scour your tourist maps and brouchers for such deals,,,
,,Flyer,5,,"We went in the evening to see the city at night.It was continually busy. We waited about 40 minutes to get on the Flyer. You must take a camera that will take night photos. Some spectacular views of the city. It is a well worth thing to do. The complete rotation of the wheel was about 35 minutes. it was a bit of a wait for a taxi to and from our hotel. It would have been better if we had organised transport to and from the Flyer before we left the hotel. Public transport is very cheap, also taxis are not that expensive. A must to see.",,,
,,fantastic visit,5,,i was in singapore in august with my family we visited the big flyer it was beatiful and fantastic view so we can see all singapore like marina the beatiful hotel large builing,,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,"Breathtaking views of beautiful iconic Singapore landmarks and night skyline from up here. We went on a weekday, and quite some time after sunset (which is peak time, long wait) so the queue was really brief, there was hardly any waiting actually. Didn't catch the daylight-to-twilight-transition but still a great view nonetheless.",,,
,,Good view during sunset thru night,4,,We went there with no line..it took us only 10 minutes wait from entrance to entering the capsule.. but the line to buy the tickets took longer..so probably better buy online? We share the ride with around 10 people but we still able to take good pictures..better to catch a ride on sunset thru night ..the view of Singapore at night are amazing.. The ride takes about 30 minutes..,,,
,,Great view but there is better.,4,,"Quite a popular tourist attraction and not cheap. An easy way to see the sights in all directions with the family. There are higher and cheaper places to see the sights though.

I would recommend ION Sky if your looking for a free option that is spectacular, if you want somewhere you can have a drink at a hefty price try 1-Altitude @ 1 Raffles Place",,,
,,wonderful view on the city,5,,"it's a must do in Singapore. from the top you'll be able to see all the buildings of the city, the marina bay sands hotel, the formula 1 circuit, gardens by the bay and even the borders of Indonesia and malesia.",,,
,,Amazing Experience,5,,"Singapore Flyer is very similar to London Eye. It gives an overall vision of the city of Singapore and it's nearby islands. The attraction is priced at SGD 33 per person and if you pay by cash, you can avoid the long queues here. There are seats within each cabin of the flyer, and the flyer moves slowly and one does not feel the smooth movement of this flyer. The city view from the top is amazing. It is better to take the flyer during the day as the night time view cannot be that clear as compared to the day time view. Do remember to take plenty of pictures and videos here. A very memorable experience.",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"Safe flight above Singapore. Nice and easy to get on and off the flyer. Once you were at the top it was great to see so much views, over the harbour and the city. The staff were great too.",,,
,,A new way to see Singapore,5,,"A great way to see Singapore with a birds eye view. Breathtaking scenery in all directions, a smooth ride well worth the cost, a must do
TIP.. don't go on with Arabic children on board as they are very noisy and bad mannered and not corrected by mothers. Get the next carriage.",,,
,,Gotta Do It...On A Sunny Day!,5,,"We kind of ended up at the Singapore Flyer by accident. No matter - it was well worth it.

We went around 10.30 am after it had been raining. This meant the sky was crystal clear. I reckon it may not be so good on a muggy afternoon.

Reasonable value for money. Quick service. Exceptionally clean. Bit difficult to get to though.",,,
,,Must see the rotating experience,5,,I think one of the largest flyer with 28 capsules which are very large accommodating numerous ppl. This shows the entire city panoramic view and once in life experience. Ppl having altophobia plz stay away as is bit scare also,,,
,,city view,4,,28 gondolas in the singapore flyers lets u enjoy the city view slowly from various angles to ensure you enjoy the complete view,,,
,,Sight seeing on Singapore flyer,4,,"Very good sight attraction, I was on Singapore some years back and I visited the flyer, you can't imagine all you will see when you get to the top. If you have phobia for height you will be trebling",,,
,,Amazing romantic experience and dinner,5,,"My partner surprised me with a romantic dinner on tge flyer.
He is a little scared of heights so I wasn't expecting it, he only had a few moments fear as our table was positioned well that he didn't have to look down.
The food is great, the staff are so friendly and accommodating.
The view was amazing and there were fireworks on the bay so it was a beautiful sight. You can see so much from the flyer and take some great photos.
Even though we shared the room with other people the tables were spaced out enough we really didn't notice we weren't alone.
This was a once in a lifetime thing to do and one I will remember forever.",,,
,,Brilliant View,5,,"We checked the sunset timing before making sure we got ourselves a ride on the flyer where we would be right on top around the time of the setting sun. Best decision ever. We got to see the Singapore skyline in both day and night conditions. The view on the other side is incredible as well.

The whole thing lasted for about half an hour or so.

Totally worth it if you're a sucker for a good view.",,,
,,Best time to visit is evening.,3,,"One of the iconic must visit place in Singapore. As the time passes now there are better places to visit if you are on limited budget or short of time.

Ride lasts about 45 minutes and gives you an excellent view of Singapore. For better experience reach there when sun is just about to set. If you can time your visit then you will have an unforgettable experience of city changing colours.",,,
,,Good at top point,5,,"when you reach top you can sea malaysia if its sunny day with clear sky , i tried two times i was lucky in second time , you can see almost all marina bay and singapore",,,
,,Amazing Views,4,,This ride is a 30 minute trip in a very comfortable car . A giant ferris wheel. The views of the entire city are awesome. Looking out at the bay from on top was my favorite. It moves so slowly you do not feel like you are moving. Enjoyed it.,,,
,,Ferries Wheel..,3,,It's something to do.. but unsure if one would do it again after the first time.. go when the skyline is clear and I believe sunset or evening would be lovely. We did it one afternoon and it was a clear day..,,,
,,Excellent way to see the city from above!,5,,"We've been on wheels in many cities, this was one of the best. There was very little queueing, very easy to board, the wheel is huge and runs slowly so you get plenty of time to get 360 views of the city. Recommended",,,
,,"Best way to capture Singapore skyline, away from crowd at a decent price",4,,"I paid S$30 to take a ride on this flyer. I could habe saved S$3 if I had booked it online but it does not make much difference to me. The price I paid for this attraction was worth it. I got a seat of mine, high in the sky and view the entire city with clarity. Fortunately it was a bright day.
This might not be a good attraction to consider, on a rainy day. It gave me ample space and time to capture Singapore's skyline using pictures and videos to cherish for the forthcoming times.
Absolutely no crowds to hinder the focus.",,,
,,Brilliant!,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is the best view point of the city, it may seem a bit expensive but when you get to the top it is worth every cent. I went in the evening when it was dark, Marina Bay is stunning with great photo opportunities, Well worth a visit.",,,
,,What a view,5,,"This is probably the best way to see the city. It provide a 360 degree view of Singapore. A ""have to do it"" part of the itinerary in Singapore in my opinion",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"Do yourself a favour and do this, the cost was reasonable of around 35 Singapore Dollars per person, tip get there early in the morning or before lunch as the queues are much shorter",,,
,,Flying visit,4,,"Haven seen the wheel from a distance and read on Trip Advisor it is worth doing I thought I would try it out. Compared to the London Eye, Singapore try to add more to your experience by creating a visual walk-through before boarding. They possible had huge queues in mind when planning; but this does not distract and you can walk through very quickly. It was quiet when I visited; early afternoon on a Saturday, and there were about 8 of us to a pod, so definitely quieter compared to London and about the same price. You get a really good view from the top which, goes without saying. I thought it worth doing this instead of trying to get to the top of Marina Bay Sands which seems to attract more negatives on this website. I would say this is a better option than queuing or paying over the odds to get to the top of the hotel. This is a good family attraction and worth the visit.",,,
,,Not as nice as expected,3,,"It was fun to ride it; but there were some noisy kids in the same capsule, which spoiled our ride. It can't be avoided unless you charter a whole capsule.

The Sands Skypark now is higher up with nicer views; it doesn't cost as much as this attraction.

I wouldn't deny that this would be a nice experience, but I wouldn't want to repeat the ride.",,,
,,Salim,4,,I must visit if you are in Singapore. It gives you a complete 360 degrees view of the city. Specially the F1 track can be viewed and looks awesome.,,,
,,Very cool way to see downtown Singapore... from WAY up!,5,,"Really enjoyed our trip here. Came just after a thunderstorm so it was hot and humid but the cars are well air conditiined. But, the best part is the view! The trip is long enough to allow you to get a good look at the surrounding area. The view of the Sky Park is particularly cool. One of the things I liked most was being able to look down on the Singapore road course (auto racing). Very cool. Walk over the Spiral Bridge and take in the sigbts. Impressive.",,,
,,Great 360 degree view of the city!!,4,,"This was fantastic to do in the evening after dinner and also a good time to avoid a crowd. The flyer offers an awesome panoramic view of Singapore at night. It takes about 30 minutes to complete the circuit, but it does slow down at times and it seems a bit too long. Definitely worth it though and pre-booking tickets online did save some time from waiting in the line to purchase.",,,
,,Great Views,5,,The Singapore Flier is certainly a great way to orientate your self. It has wide views in every direction. The multilingual directory mkes pin pointing key features easy. The leisurely turn of the wheel makes taking it all in easy. As a point for the hop on hop off bus getting there is easy. The staff were friendly and helpful.,,,
,,A must do,5,,"This is a beautiful experience with a good overview of Singapore. It moves very slowly so it is a gentle ride. Excellent for photos over the Marina Bay area. Would recommend as one of the initial things to do, so that you can get an overview of the whole city.",,,
,,Flyer,5,,Fabulous views. A bit difficult get to but well worth it. Staff very efficient and well organised. Make sure you take your camera!,,,
,,perfect for a special date,5,,"this can be reserved for special date at night. and if you plan to propose it is THE place in singapore. Just make sure your date says YES, or there will be a lot of people sympathising with you. Lovely views in the day, lights at night.",,,
,,Mystery?,2,,I have no idea if the flyer was operating or not..I have spent a week in Singapore and my hotel room had a view just on the flyer..I have never seen it moved during that time....so. We went to go there but we didn't...,,,
,,An all-around solid tourism spot!,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is the definition of a one trick pony. You take the capsule upwards, stay in the air for about 20 minutes, come back down and move on. If you were expecting anything else, you'll be dissapointed. If you saw this coming, you'll be satisfied.

There really isn't much else to say. The views of Singapore are stunning, the capsules allow you to take photos galore, and when we took the trip the place wasn't busy and the whole thing was a 45-minute affair. A solid four stars for the experience.",,,
,,Great views,5,,Fantastic views over Marina Bay The race track looks from above really small. The Merlion looked very impressive. It is worthwhile doing it.,,,
,,Worth the price of admission,4,,"The flyer will rotate you in 33 minutes to give you a glorious view of Singapore. The entry fee is steep, but the views are worth it. This may be boring to kids though as the flyer moves very slowly.",,,
,,high up in the sky!,5,,"if you have never been on one, its exciting. it moves very very slowly. so everyone is taking a million pictures. bring your tripod. some of the best views of Singapore.",,,
,,Highest flyer in the world,4,,It's highest flyer in the world .i can see all the city from the singapore flyer. It's amazing .it has several big and cozy cabin. You can take photos from above.its romantic.if i want to talk about the price i can say the price is a bit high,,,
,,Worth a trip,5,,"I visit Singapore every few months and had never been in this before. Looking for something to fill the time I l decided to go for a trip and glad I did as I thoroughly enjoyed it.

As it was fairly quiet I got one of the 'capsules' to myself which was great.

Brilliant views of the Bay Area of Singapore.",,,
,,Best way to view SG the way it is!,5,,"As a first time tourist, this place will be cool for you. Covered with glass this place also provides information about every corner you can see. It also has beautiful souvenir shop and a small bar. It is the best place to visit.....",,,
,,Good for a view,4,,"Great place to get a view of the Marina Bay area, and on a clear day you can see quite some distance. It take approx 30mins to go round",,,
,,Nice View,5,,"Nice view, worth to ride, half an hour. No queu, i had a flyer for 5 of us (without sharing flyer with others) with normal price. Feel no sickness because it so slow. Its better to buy packet ticket include funvee (online by klook) rather than buy ticket in counter ( cost is same ). They take photos of you before the ride, then u can buy it $25 for 1 photo or $60 for 6 photos.",,,
,,Fabulous viewpoint of Singapore,5,,It is definitely a must visit attraction to catch a glimpse of the beautiful Singapore skyline. The ride lasts for around 35-40 mins in an air-conditioned gondolas with seating facilities. Guests can can plenty of photos given the 360 degree views on all sides. Ideal to go during late afternoon to catch the sunset views of those in Marina Bay. This ride can be accessed by those with wheel-chairs as well. One of the interesting feature is the dining option which allows you to dine in a dedicated gondola giving it a unique experience.,,,
,,Mastermind creation,5,,"This is called creativity man!!! Love it,very cold inside I wish they write on their tickets to get jackets I would have enjoyed much more if I was warm Love the beauty 馃槝馃槝",,,
,,totally over rated,3,,took my family to ride on the Singapore flyer. We were put in to a totally over crowded cabin full of screaming kids. There was no space to st and had to stand right through out the ride in a cabin full of screaming kids.,,,
,,Must visit place,5,,"This is the biggest wheel in Asia, offering 30 minutes circle. The views are amazing, but if your budget is limited, you can skip it and go to Marina Bay roof, which is even higher and you are not limited in time, otherwise - must see",,,
,,Visit in singapore,5,,"Great place! Beautiful gardens! Fantastic place to visit. Very easy to get there, tube system is easy and organised. Garden presents itself great during the day as well as during the night, beautiful light show, make this place look magical.",,,
,,Beautiful View,5,,"We went on the Singapore flyer on a Friday night, had to line up a little bit for the tickets, however when we lined up to get on the flyer we got on pretty much straight away. Its pretty roomy inside. The views were amazing, I would defiantly say the money spent was worth it.",,,
,,Nice Overview of the Island,4,,"A comfortable spacious capsule. Barely feeling it move, very stable. Gradually seeing the overview of the small island. Offers different view from day and night. Both are attractive and nice.",,,
,,What a great view,5,,"The Singapore Flyer was amazing, the views from the top WOW!!!! A great perspective on Singapore. A must do when in Singapore.",,,
,,Worth the visit,5,,Great views over Singapore. Really worth the visit. We got there early so it wasn't too busy. Cabins are air conditioned and the staff didn't overfill them (not sure what it is like at peak time!),,,
,,A view from the top,5,,Have been here twice now and enjoyed both times. Lovely views of Singapore and especially Marina Bay Sands. Best to visit on a sunny day and hopefully at a time it's not too busy!,,,
,,good experience,4,,"Beautiful view of singapore skyline from the flyer. The whole ride takes around half an hour, worth to go.",,,
,,Visit to Singapore,5,,"Travelled to singapore througg Jet airlines. Being 1st visit to singapore, nice to see skyways, nyce airport,supportive and efficient custom staff is d highlight of singapore",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"One of the tallest point in Singapore that gives you a great view of the city, even on a cloudy day. There are numerous eateries nearby and it is about 10 minutes walk from the nearest MRT station",,,
,,Night flight,5,,We have been on the London and eye and were very excited about going on the Singapore flyer! The views were amazing even at night and as it was Singapore day there were fire works? Excellent,,,
,,Up up and Away !!,5,,"We did this at night and we had a fabulous panoramic views of the city below and Marina Bay area. I think that night time is definitely the best time to do it. There were long queues to get on but it's well worth it. We went up on Valentine's night and some of the pods were booked privately where a meal was served, very romantic place for proposals! Would highly recommend.",,,
,,awasom in the niight,4,,it is same like London eye. but I think it is bigger than that. anyhow it butiful in the night time when the whole city lighten-up.,,,
,,Excellent experience,5,,"The height thrills, the view from the elevation is under forgettable. It's nice to see the lighting from a distance also",,,
,,Good views,4,,"The views are great in the day, and sometimes you can see all the way to Indonesia but a bit expensive for the ride. The ride lasts about 30 mins and 1 cabin can take about 30 people",,,
,,Nice and relaxing way to avoid the crowds.,4,,The ride takes about 45 minutes and you get nice views all around. It costs about $30 but it's well worth it. Only had to wait about 10 minutes to get on and we had the whole gondola to ourselves. A pleasant way to spend a morning or afternoon.,,,
,,Fly over the city.,4,,Fab time on this ride. Great views 360 degrees of the city. The harbor view is spectacular. Great value for money. Lots of other things to do such as flight simulator. Plus lots of shops selling souvenirs of all description,,,
,,Photo opportunities galore,3,,"Me and my partner did the VIP experience which wasn't that VIP at all, we collected our tickets and proceeded to the guest services VIP lounge where we were asked to wait for approx 20 minutes with no kind of hospitality at all, just a badly tuned TV stuck in a corner, we were then fast-tracked to our capsule where we received a cocktail and enjoyed the views, the difference in price just for the very unimpressive VIP service was more than double the standard $33 ride price, the only saving grace were the stunning night time views of the city from the top of the flyer. Its worth a visit but stick to the standard ticket, it really isn't worth anymore than that and in my eyes anything more is not got value for money.",,,
,,360 degree view of City,5,,This is a must visit place for any tourist and from here one can see beautiful panoramic view of the city and enjoy a scenic view of the city.Staff are extremely frinedly.,,,
,,"Day view is not bad, though night will be best",4,,"We, seven in a group, were there in the morning after visiting Merlion. Though we realize that view at night much more beautiful, but we have no more time to visit SF. And it's not that disappointing cause the view in the clear morning helped us to see Singapore in 360"". We can take pictures around and posed in normal to craziest pose ever ;)",,,
,,Beautiful view,5,,A must do in Singapore. You can view the entire Singapore skyline from the top. The city looks beautiful from up there.,,,
,,Birds view,5,,Singapore Flyer is the best to have the birds view. The best time is after sunset to view the glittery city and sky scrappers.,,,
,,Awesome View,5,,Great to get a good look at the city. We went up at around 7:30 so saw the lights coming on at the gardens and the city sparkling.,,,
,,High above Singapore,4,,"We only had one day in Singapore so we opted to view the whole city to get a feel and this is a great way to see the Singapore landscape. From the city skyline to all of the barges in the sea it's extraordinary. We were there in low season so there was no line to get on. I don't know how I would feel if it was busy. They need to improve the information around the wheel. Maybe have the history of the city on the walls where you cue up? Also inside your cabin it would be great to compare the height of the flyer to other worldwide buildings like the Eiffel Tower, London eye and Empire State Building etc. the comparison chart on the top of the Eiffel Tower is great. Slightly over priced but really central to lots of great Singapore sights.",,,
,,Great view of Singapore,4,,"This Ferris wheel is a great way to see Singapore from above. There are great photo opportunities to be had, would definitely recommend.",,,
,,Great!,5,,Really worth it! It seems quite pricey but the views you get are really amazing. I recommend going up at night because the lights are so pretty. However if it's a clear day I'm sure it'd be good during the day too.,,,
,,Nice experience!,4,,The Singapore Flyer offers great views of the city and is great for a family trip. Make sure the weather is ok before you go. Rain or haze could ruin the experience,,,
,,Nice view of Singapore downtown,5,,"This attraction provides you with a nice view of Singapore downtown. We chose the dinner option where they served you a four course dinner in a dining car which take at most 10 people. On my trip, there was only one other couple sharing the entire dining car with us. We have time for two rounds which lasted about an hour. Food was OK, considering they are made in the restaurant on the ground and transport to the cart for your enjoyment. You will get a great daytime and night time view of the city if you choose the 7:30pm dinner as it does not get dark until almost 8 in the summer. They do not allow kids under certain age to join the dining option unless you book the entire private dinner car. Check their website for details. I do recommend this for a more intimate and leisure way to enjoy the Singapore landscape.",,,
,,The best view of the F1 track,5,,"Great ride with the best view of the F1 Track, wish I could be there in September. The experience was similar to the London Eye but still worth it for the great views.",,,
,,Not bad,3,,"The ride took quite a bit, maybe 20 to 30 mins....I personally like the view fom the top, but would understand if some people didn't. My family and I went durin the day...so maybe the view woud have been better later... All in all, still something to tick of if you're around.",,,
,,Stunning views.,4,,"Had this as part of a SIA stopover package, so no cost. Got there early which I would recommend as we had three of us in a pod and missed the buses that later turned up. Was half an hour exactly. Would definitely do it before 9.30 or be prepared for a wait. Nice river setting to walk around and a couple of shops. No seats by the bus parking and the hop on/off buses didn't stop long enough to get to them. Not really the flyers fault. Choose a clear day and don't look down.",,,
,,Excellent attraction,5,,"We visited the Singapore Flyer on our first afternoon in Singapore. We were looking for things to do that would not be too busy on the weekend. It was a good choice.
We purchased our tickets and were allowed to enter before a large tour group, which was good. Didn鈥檛 have to wait for long before we entered our capsule for the 30 minute ride. We shared it with another 6 or 8 people. Plenty of room for us all. You hardly know you are moving, it is so gentle.
We were amazed at the views of all parts of Singapore that we could see. The day was cloudy but the visibility was pretty good. Great view below of the F1 track and pit lane.
We could clearly see the soccer stadium all set up for the Pocari Sweat run, that was being run that evening.
I had previously been on the Flyer at dusk so it was good to ride on it during the daytime.

This is another 鈥榤ust do鈥?when in Singapore!",,,
,,Great trip,5,,We went at 12 noon and there was just a 5 minute wait - there were only 4 of us in the capsule. Great views - we'll worth it. Xxc,,,
,,Don't miss to visit,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is Asia鈥檚 Largest Giant Observation Wheel. Standing at a stunning 165m from the ground, the Flyer offers you breathtaking, panoramic views of the Marina Bay and beyond. There鈥檚 also a range of shops, restaurants and facilities.Sky View including the Kitchen for private dining. The best time is before sunset until they close.
Opening Hours
Opens Daily: 8.30am 鈥?10.30pm
Last Flight: 10.00pm",,,
,,The best ever views,5,,"We went here on a week day and it was very quiet. Looking at the prices it is very reasonable for a magnificent view of the city. It is very expensive to have your own capsule, however as it was quiet they were allowing everyone to have their own. Our family had a great time, took heaps of photos a thoroughly enjoyed this outing as it is not something we can't experience at home.",,,
,,A fun ride with a good view of Singapore,4,,Worth a trip... The Flyer takes you on a half hour journey with great views of the bay area and city/Central Business District. The cabins are clean and spacious and not too many people are crammed in one. When you disembark there are food and shopping outlets around the area for those looking to chill - the place tends to be quieter compared to the rest of town and is a good location for chilling and enjoying the view.,,,
,,Big wheel with good views of city,3,,"I have been on a few of these around the wall and this was similar to others providing spectacular views of the city and surrounding areas. You can even have dinner within one of the cabins. It's worth a trip if you have time, but there are so many other beautiful things to see in Singapore that I would prefer in priority",,,
,,Good view,4,,You can have a good sight view from the top of the flyer. Before boarding the flyer you can see a introduction of how does it work and brief info of the view in a small exhibition.,,,
,,Gigantic lookout of Modern Singapore,5,,"Love love love the scenery when we were on top of Sin Flyer... you can see many buildings around the area. There are stadium, MBS, Esplanade, Theater, F1 circuit, Garden by the Bay, etc.

Each capsule can be filled up to 28pax. I also saw a capsule for dining..nice...

Managed to convinced my client that this is not scary though it's so high. Because the speed was like a snail... :))",,,
,,Go with friends,5,,I went with 20 of my newest friends from the MBA program. It was great. It's all about creating memories. The views were spectacular. It's a must do!,,,
,,amazing amazing amazing,5,,"just gotta do this one, loved the Singapore flyer, beautiful view we did it at night, meals on the flyer is amazing, don't leave Singapore until you travel the flyer",,,
,,Great View,5,,"Only $33 per person and took 30 minutes to do the total revolution. Could see every thing, nice a quiet and enjoyed it thoroughly. worth the money.",,,
,,Just go!!,5,,"A half hour well spent. Great views, especially towards the sunset. Our two teenagers enjoyed it as well.",,,
,,Well worth the time,5,,I think this is well worth doing. Views are magnificent even though it was a little cloudy. I have also done the London Eye and this baby is 30 metres higher. Wish we had done the evening trip with the dining experience as night time views would have putgiven a new perspective on Singapore.,,,
,,fly in the sky!,5,,"Great views, great picture opportunity. Is large enough to take 20 people at one time. Great dinner possibilities on board if you reserve in advance.",,,
,,Excellent View,5,,"Flyer is a giant wheel which movies very slowly and a ride takes around 40-45 minutes. As it moves slowly, one can see the beautiful view of Singapore city.

Recommend to go after the sun goes down as the city is beautiful with lights. Cabin is air conditioned anyhow.",,,
,,Not the greatest views,2,,Wasn't the best weather the day I went so was a bit overcast but overall I felt there weren't that great views. Yes you could see gardens by the bay and yes you could see marina Bay Sands but not the greatest angle. Perhaps this would be more impressive at night..... not worth the $33 fee,,,
,,Too slow and not that worth,3,,"It should be best viewed during late evening with night life of Singapore around, other wise with the amount of hype built around Flyer is not worth.. It becomes boring after first 5 minutes",,,
,,"Must visit , excellent views of the city",5,,Even though I have a fear of heights I did not feel it going in the flyer. It takes 28 minutes to complete one cycle. You can see most of Singapore and take some great photos. Dont miss going on the flyer.,,,
,,Great views!,5,,We went just as the sun was going down and got to see Singapore both during the day and then all lit up. It is definitely a beautiful view and I would recommend doing it.,,,
,,Great Views,4,,"Worth doing once, the Singapore Flyer basic flight costs $33 for an adult and $21 for a child (3-12yrs). Nearest MRT station is Promenade Station which is about 5 minutes walk.",,,
,,Birds Eye view worth the time and effort to find it!,4,,"You can see the Flyer in front of you but negotiating the way there can be challenging if you are on foot. Pedestrian crossings underpasses and bridges make the journey from hotels in the CBD far from direct and the heat makes it tempting to weave your way via the many shopping centres with air conditioning. Then you have to cross under a major highway.

Best bet is to get a cab. They are relatively cheap outside the peak time rush and the walk isn't that scenic after all... You can admire the architecture more easily from the Flyer when you get there without the noise of the traffic.

The flyer is billed as the largest Ferris wheel and it is certainly impressive against the skyline. Early afternoon was quiet with no queue and we didn't feel the need to linger in the dingy exhibits lining the approach. The capsules were only half full so plenty of space to move around and enjoy the view. Strangely the places shown on ribbon posters inside the capsules were not aligned with where that building or landmark might be found but did give you a reminder of what you should be looking for.

Singapore's cityscape is best viewed from above and the Flyer gives ample time to do so. Even the Zeppelin like structure forming the top of the Bay Sands Hotel reveals some of its detail from the Flyer. Well worth the visit and time spent there though be aware that the commentary (limited) could be louder and clearer and the music that accompanies your rotation could be quieter!

Allow time as you can't be sure how long the queue will be and ignore the rather soulless and frankly shabby shopping area at the base of the Flyer. Why spoil an impressive landmark with yet another shopping mall? It all looked quite sad and we were happy to eventually find a way out. Signage could be better! Shame that tainted an otherwise good experience.",,,
,,Worth a visit...not Must !!!,4,,"It really depends on what time and which day you visit...after 6:30 PM is the best timing.
Had been there with family....and the 30 min round trip was good with great views of Singapore. If it's a weekend you will find more people in one pod, again it depends. But once it start moving you will not just sit...
You can opt for a dining experience as well if you pay more !!!",,,
,,Magnificent,5,,A really good attraction while visiting Singapore. Nice and slow pace so plenty of time to take pictures. My opinion is that it's well spent money to take a trip.,,,
,,GET A VIEW OF MALAYSIA AND INDONESIA,4,,"The best time to visit this attraction would be to take a ride around 6 in the evening. If the weather is clear, you can get a slight view of Malaysia. The Singapore flyer has a nice history as well. According to Feng Shui, it has 28 capsules/ compartments with each capsule having a carrying capacity of 28 persons each. Also, the wheel rotates 28 times in a day. The Singapore flyer is the world's largest observatory wheel with a height of 165 meters. The whole of Singapore looks beautiful. Do give a visit. You can go to see the light show later in the evening at 9PM near the Marina Bay Sands. Also, the Singapore flyer is very near to Promenade MRT.",,,
,,Amazing man made garden,4,,This is one of the most unique gardens in the world. Lots of people but a treasure of tropical plants.,,,
,,Spectacular,5,,It's equally spectacular when seen from outside or be inside. The best spot to see and click photo from outside is the dragonfly bridge near garden by the Bay. Not to mention during evening.,,,
,,Excellent view of Singapore's lights!,4,,Go in the evening just around twilight to take in both daytime as well as night time views. Way more fun experiencing the citylights in the evening/nightime. The rotation takes about 30 mins which is good enough to get your money's worth.,,,
,,A dying attraction in sh,4,,"Just because it's a dying attraction does not mean that it's bad. The ride takes 30 mins and the view from the top is not bad. The Singapore skyline. Best time to go will be approximately boarding into the cabin at 6.30pm. Then you will be around the time to catch the Singapore sunset. Half bright, half dark (if u know what I mean. As the sun is setting.)",,,
,,Worth the money,5,,"Singapore flyer is a must visit.. It gives you a panoramic view of all the monuments of this country

Very similar to London eye but I found this to be more picturesque than the London eye

Avoid weekends and try to go at abt 6 pm..to enjoy the changing colors of the sky line",,,
,,Expensive but worth it,5,,We did this as a spur of the moment activity and I'm so glad we did. It takes you through a little museum type thing before telling you all about the flyer before you get on it. When you are on it the view is breathtaking!! We thought it was a bit expensive but just meant we had a cheaper lunch at subway afterwards to make up for it with our budget!,,,
,,Great view,4,,"The best view of Singapore. I was surprised how good it was. It's airconditioned and very smooth, I enjoyed it",,,
,,On top of the world馃榾,3,,"We were lucky to have the capsule all by ourselves. We were twosome,husband and wife鈽猴笍 The feeling was nice when you are on top and almost see the whole of Singapore for 30 minutes .. It was indeed a great experience . I just hope that they will give discount to foreigners and as well to the local residents. Because the ticket is quite expensive.",,,
,,Nice view from the top,5,,Worth visiting the singapore flyer beautiful attractive view of the city from the top . Will recommend to visit both time in day and in night too.,,,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,"For the its size Singapore has so much to see and do. But if time is a constraint I would recommend Singapore Flyer as the must do activity, and if time is not a constraint still this will top my list. This flyer takes little more than half an hour to take the full circle, and the views at each level is breathtaking. The essence and soul of Singapore can be seen and felt through this ride. The F-1 track, the ships, the Marina Bay Hotel, the Merlion, the football pitch on the water and many more sights are a treat to behold. Ofcourse in sunny day the sights will be visible clearly.
At Singapore $33 ( 1 S$ = Rs50/- when I visited) it was a tad costly affair for me, but something which I will never regret. I recommend it unreservedly.",,,
,,Enjoyable experiance,5,,"Our family loved this attraction. Similar to the London eye but bigger and more things to see & interact with whilst waiting in line to go on the ride. We queued for just a few minutes. The kids really enjoyed taking lots of pictures and spotting the various sites in the city, especially seeing the preparations for the Singapore Grand Prix. Not sure of cost as I purchased an I venture card via tripadvisor which we used for 3 attractions. A great option as you jump the ques & get in much quicker than standing in the normal ticket ques.",,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,The Flyer provides excellent visibility around Singapore and is slow moving so gives plenty of time to view the area and take lots of photos. I,,,
,,Great views,5,,Saw great views all the way round. Visited during the day but I bet the night lights would look amazing. No queues.,,,
,,Fabulous views,5,,"Great activity to do at dusk - beautiful city of lights and amazing views. Because it travels very slowly, you don't feel any motion sickness. The cars are very spacious. Well worth the money.",,,
,,Exciting views,3,,"Once you are on the Flyer it is an outstanding experience. However we were a little bit disappointed about the entrance area, which would need renovation and more attractive panels with facts about the Flyer and the City.",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"Great attraction and reasonably priced. We took the ride just before sunset, so we pretty much got a soft daylight view and an awesome night view.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,Great way to see Singapore and nice gently ride. Whole ride takes thirty minutes and well worth it. Great views all around.,,,
,,On top of the Singapore,5,,Hey nice experience. within 30 min you can have a very nice view of Singapore specially in evening. Must try,,,
,,Great viewz,5,,We went mid-afternoon to this so it wasn't very busy and saw some beautiful views including skyscrapers and the F1 track below us. There were about 9 of us in a pod so wasn't crowded at all!,,,
,,Hoghest point around,3,,"You are even higher than the By Sands. Also, a great view of the Grand Prix circuit. Takes about half an hour to get around and worth the time. Best when a clear day.",,,
,,Beautiful experience,5,,"We visited about an hour before sunset. Not crowded at all and we got quickly entertained. Cabins are roomy and air conditioned. They didn't overload our cabin so we had enough space to view Singapore and take pictures.

There are pointers all over the cabin to guide you what are you looking at.

Kids enjoyed it alot.

The ride is about 30 minutes.",,,
,,Awesome view of the whole city,4,,"Unless you have a large group you will probably share a carriage with others. Ride takes about 30 minutes, so worth the money $33 in my opinion. 360 views of all the sights. The carriage itself is quite large and stationary so feel very secure and safe even if you have fear of heights. Fun!",,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Took the MRT here which was easy and efficient. The Flyer was a small walk away. Lucky we didn't have to queue for tickets or getting on board. Our carriage wasn't crowded and we could move around and take photos as we wished. Fantastic views and gave us a good orientation of the city, visiting on our first day. Highly recommended. The Flyer moves very slowly so all up took about 30 minutes to go round. Lots of good reasonably priced places there to grab some lunch afterwards. We walked to Marina Bay Sands afterwards as realised how close it actually was.",,,
,,Flyover,4,,"Took my 10 year old son on this when we went to Singapore. It takes half an hour to do the 360 degrees & the view is marvellous as you can see from my photos.
The ride is fairly cheap compared to other attractions & my son loved being so high.
Afterwards I took him the the fish spa which is located on the 1st level. This place is very expensive. But you can chose a massage & the size of the fish which nibble on your feet, I just hope you aren't ticklish.",,,
,,Must go,5,,"When in Singapore this is a ""must go"", this is the second highest Giant wheel in the world, it has one of the greatest views of the city, it turns in a very low speed so it's possible to contemplate the city in all directions, if you're looking for a different experience I recommend the dinner at the flyer, it is a bit costly but a unique experience.",,,
,,On top you are with Marina Sand Bay,5,,when you reached at the top Marina Sand Bay in your eyes 360 Round almost all Singapore you can see plan to go Again but Time Ended,,,
,,Memorable,5,,A place where we are able to remember always! Relaxing and amazing! First time in Singapore and a clean environment and that is a Yes! Thank you Singapore!,,,
,,Breathtaking,4,,"Couldn't go but as we were staying at the Marina Bay Sands, so it was visible from our hotel room...",,,
,,Beauty!,4,,Although we found it a tad expensive but worth visiting once. We went in the evening. There is a small museum kind of thing preceding the flyer.. we were in a hurry so we quit that. Option of taking a professional photo is there. The view of the city from above was breath taking. The timing was so perfect that we saw the laser light show from above. Mesmerizing experience. You can shop for souvenirs at the exit.,,,
,,"Singapore's own ""London Eye""!",4,,Be awed by the spectacular view up at the top! Recommended time is during sunset to catch the changing colors of the skyline!,,,
,,Was OK ...,3,,The flyer was part of our SIA explorer pass so admission was included. Took around 35 minutes to complete. Was ok but I wouldn't do it again plus I'm glad I didn't actually pay the $33 each for it.,,,
,,"Great views take your camera, kid friendly",3,,"A lovely way to spend 40 minutes in the evening, definitely visit after 7pm so you can watch the sun setting across the city and watch the city lights come to life. It's a great way to watch the Super Trees in the Gardens light up also. Very child friendly and lots of fun picking out landmarks in Singapore.",,,
,,Backpacking must do,5,,"I was backpacking around Singapore and although this is fairly expensive for a backpackers budget, it is a must do! Great attraction which they built up to last a couple of hours. Educational and amazing views.",,,
,,Panoramic birds eye view !,4,,"It is an iconic attraction of the Singapore skyline. It is similar to the London Eye. The spacious capsule accommodates 28 people comfortably. View of Singapore or for that matter any country from a high rise building / structure is always awesome. The panoramic view includes Singapore鈥檚 East Coast, Marina Barrage, Gardens by the Bay, as well as the neighboring islands of Malaysia and Indonesia and you will get to see the Marina Bay Sands, Marina Bay Financial Center and the National Stadium & the F1 track. Go on weekdays to avoid the rush & don't go on rainy days. There are 3 Levels where a lot of restaurants, cafes & bars are located. One complete rotation takes 30 mins. so make sure you visit the restroom before boarding the ride !",,,
,,Good Spot for Pictures,3,,"When in Singapore , you would be coming across many points where you can have a look at beautiful singapore from High Vantage Points. To me Singapore Flyer is a beautiful place for Pictures , but speding around 30 $ for the views from top is waste of money . The views from atop a not much different which you can get fro free.",,,
,,one of the must things to do when u visit singapore,5,,the largest eye int he world standing at 165m tall well have to see .once in u can see nearby malaysia and indonesia and the architecture is marvelous,,,
,,High in the sky.,4,,"All four of us Senior Citizens enjoyed our experience on the Singapore Flyer. Great views & slow enough to take in all the views & snap photos too. We booked on the internet before we left Perth, much cheaper.",,,
,,A Adrenaline Pump thrill,5,,We have visited the Singapore in October 15 in group tour and found it a out of world experience. A giant structure scientifically made of steel and glass in such a manner that you never fell a height problem.,,,
,,Sunset on the flyer,5,,"We boarded the flyer at 7.15pm and we were lucky enough to watch the sunset over Singapore. Great experience, never to be forgotten.",,,
,,Very attractive at night,4,,I loved to watch Singapore flyer at night time under the lights. Hong Kong and Singapore use a lot of lights for displaying the things,,,
,,A slow flyer with good views,3,,"A very nice view from the Singapore Flyer, but it is moving very slow and takes a very very long time!",,,
,,I am terrified of ferris wheels. This one was great.,5,,"We have traveled to a lot of locations that have ferris wheels, and every time, my four year old twins want to ride them at least once. I am terrified of them! But I grit my teeth and bear it. So when we discovered the Singapore Flyer, I figured I was headed into yet another scary-as-all-get-out tourist experience. This one was so bearable! First of all, the car you travel in is huge, like the size of a small bus or shuttle, with chairs in the middle and a solid floor. You can sit in the middle and not have the feeling of the ground going out from under you. Also, the car does not swivel or swing, so it doesn't feel like you may fall out. The ride takes 1/2 an hour, and I enjoyed every minute. The view, obviously, is stunning. This was worth every penny.",,,
,,Fantastic!,5,,"Wow, so much better than I expected. Great views of course, I mean superb views. We had a capsule to ourselves and it was actually really good fun. We were intending to pay to go up to a rooftop bar, but with the kids this was much better value.",,,
,,Funny way to discover first impressions of Singapore,4,,"Included in the SIA stopover package, we did enjoy the ride at 10 AM to get some great pictures of downtown and plan our visit to Gardens in the Bay. We had arrived at 6AM and so had spent a white night flying in from AMS, but this eyeopener made all jetlag fade away! Probably more popular during evening hours when laser show Marina Bay is on, we had a private session with the family.",,,
,,Must-visit in Singapore,5,,"Fantastic attraction to look at beautiful views of Singapore. Cabins are very comfortable, but there is not enough space for all visitors to seat. However, this is not a problem as many people usually walk inside the cabin.",,,
,,Amazing views!,5,,The Singapore flyer is huge at 165m high - Larger than the London Eye. We went in the evening and the views over the city were spectacular. Each capsule can take 28 passengers and the ride is approx 30 minutes around. There are 28 capsules so even if there appears to be a large queue the wait time is short,,,
,,Beautiful night scenes,5,,"We happened to be the last ride at night, was about 10pm and really enjoyed the view of the city by night. The colours of the city really come into their own as evening sets in.",,,
,,Great Place To See All The City,5,,"When I Go with my friend,they all say great,especial that there have a good and gennerous Security, It Also have A cabin to Eat At There. You Can see all Famous place like Maria Barrage,Garden By THe Bay,etc.... If you Go to Singapore You should't forget To visit Here",,,
,,Wow what a view,4,,The Singapore Flyer is easy to access by the Hop on Hop off bus which runs all day. The views are spectacular on a clear day & there are food & drink outlets on the ground level.,,,
,,Average experience,3,,Came here with an overseas friend but found the ride to be quite average. Nothing compared to the London Eye. Would probably only come here again if I have to entertain overseas friends.,,,
,,Very slow moving cradle.,4,,"It is a slow moving cradle ,it takes around 1 hrs finish the ride. You can see all of marine bay area from top.",,,
,,Slow and stunning,4,,"Typical Singapore - this attraction is spotless, safe, stunning and the best in the world. What a great view.",,,
,,Best view of Singapore during sunset,3,,"If you want a nice view of the city as the sun sets, there is no other place to experience it then here at the Singapore flyer. The sunset in Singapore is more or less the same time everyday, it starts about 6:15 pm and the sun will be below the horizon by 6:45pm. The wheel takes 30 mins to go one full circle so if you time it right the sun would be a perfect glow behind the city skyline and just about to go under as you reach the top. Weather permitting, if it doesn't rain or too cloudy. Once you done, local food fares are easily available at the food court below. Hokkien Mee, cha kway tiao, chicken rice and even chili crab.",,,
,,3 countries one flyer:-),5,,"Awesome view which worth the money ure paying. Its 30 min for $33.So yeah in the day time is better coz you get to see Malaysia ans Indonesia across each other:-) Inside the capsule is 360 view, plenty of space to move and do selfie hehe. Do check it out either day or night. I think they close about 9pm. Enjoy!",,,
,,My Review about Singapore Flyer,5,,Singapore Flyer is very good attraction. We can see The Downtown Singapore by Singapore Flyer. We can take a picture with beautiful view. The Flyer is very clean. This attraction is worth it.,,,
,,Expensive,3,,i found it quite expensive. Would prefer to spend the time at the marina bay instead. The view from the flyer is good,,,
,,fun attraction,4,,nice attraction next to sands by the bay. good for families but also for all ages. great views. but a high ticket price.,,,
,,Great views,4,,"There are some great views from the Singapore Flyer. However, prices are fairly high, and the tide is somewhat slow and long.",,,
,,Flying high,5,,"Sensational attraction, spectacular views, well worth the money , easy to get on and off, well organised, can either sit or stand and walk about to enjoy the views
Best time to go is about 6:30 PM, to get Twilight and night views of Marina Bay",,,
,,Excellent city view,4,,We tried the city flyer and was impressed of the view. Nice with air con in the hub and smooth and effective service. No cue when we were visiting the flyer. Tip: flying with Singapore airways you can get some discount.,,,
,,Ok for first-timers.,3,,"For 33SGD (adult ticket price as of this writing), you simply stay inside the carriage of the flyer and watch the whole thing make one complete revolution (and get a panoramic view of downtown Singapore) for around 20 minutes. Then, that's it.

Good fpr first-time visitors, but not good for repeat visits. Imagine, the panoramic view of downtown Singapore is worth 33SGD. :)",,,
,,Great view over Singapore city,4,,"Not as busy as we expected, no queue and had a pod to ourselves ! Great place to view the F1 track and pit complex, the Gardens by the bay and look up (!) at the Marina bay Sands sky deck. Not cheap, but still well worth a visit.",,,
,,Great Panorama of the Marina Bay area,3,,"Spotlessly clean and efficient like most of Singapore. Excellent views and they don't pile to many into each capsule. The aircon works a treat but it lacks a bit of commentary on the view or a map. Directly by the F1 Grand Prix pits and the bus stops for the bus tours. If your not staying in a hotel around Marina Bay, this is a great way to get an elevated overview.",,,
,,Very nice Singapore flier.,4,,It was amazing to get have a go in Singapore flier. The transparent capsule is amazing . The 30 minutes flier gives a panoramic view of Singapore city. Must go attraction in Singapore.,,,
,,great view,4,,"get to see the view of singapore. night view is nicer, can see the lightings around. short waiting time",,,
,,The Bird's Eye View,4,,Went to Singapore on businesses but did make a point to visit the flyer... last ticket is available at 10:15 pm... during operational hours tiger flyer does not stop... you have to board the capsule on the go... but don't be be scared... it's really slow and guards are there to help you... it's a half an hour ride of which the first 15 mins is not that great view... but once your capsule has reached the top... the downward journey is beautiful... the entire Singapore skyline is visible... special capsules with meal arrangement are also available... overall should visit if in Singapore,,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,"I visited Singapore flyer on last year,it is world's biggest flyer. Anyone can fly on this flyer if you go Singapore you must visit this flyer.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer at sunset,4,,It's beautiful to see the sunset up in the air. Time it to see the sky darken n see the twinkling lights below on the Esplanade n Gardens by the Bay. It's an experience.,,,
,,Good View,4,,"It was nice but not a wow I will do that again. Going up to other taller buildings was better than this. Much yes do it for an okay ride, It is a ride.",,,
,,panorama,5,,"i visist in the singapore flyer in June it was wanderfull attraction , great view no pepole around .",,,
,,Slow ride,3,,"I may be one of a few who didn't quite enjoy taking this ride. It was quite expensive for a one round ride. The best view was on the very top. For a 30 minute ride it didn't have much but the view. No narration or anything. Just like riding a really big ferris wheel. Would not go a second time though. Bright side, there is quite a good food court downstairs. We enjoyed desserts after the ride.",,,
,,Touristic and amazing!,5,,Do this at night and be amazed by the city lights and the scale of everything and the sheer glamour of it all. Just hope you aren' in the same compartment as some sweet but relentlessly noisy locals taking selfies non-stop for 30 minutes! It was still amazing though.,,,
,,One time visit place,3,,Nothing special about it but it is only one time visit attraction Its not a value for money.London eye is much better,,,
,,What a view,5,,"You can see everything, including: Marina Bay Sands The Harbour The city cute women getting dressed at a nearby Hotel The Singapore Gardens This is bigger than the London Eye! Reasonable price - definitely value for money",,,
,,Panaromic view of the city...,5,,A nice vantage point to take photos of the city.. The view from Flyer and Marina sands sky deck are almost same. So see one in the day time and the other towards dusk to c d city lit up..,,,
,,Great views,4,,As long as U good with heights this is a great opportunity to get a birds eye view of Singapore. Takes a while to complete its 360 degree journey but worth it.,,,
,,Must-do while in Singapore,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is definitely one of the must-do attractions in the city. It's not overrated unlike some of the others.

Be prepared with your camera to take some stunning pics of the Singapore skyline and don't forget to check out the Koi pond at the bottom at the end of your flight!",,,
,,Interesting,5,,"45mins Romantic Journey.Go after 6pm. It's was a big queue in the week ends,but it's move fast. Love to be there again.",,,
,,Great views,4,,Went on the flyer during the day when it wasn't busy so just my husband and I in a pod. Some great views over Singapore with some main landmarks pointed out . Very much like the London eye but we are told it is larger. Some of the pods have dining tables in them but not used during the day. Takes about 40 minutes to go round. Cost is eqivalent to about 拢30.,,,
,,Good,5,,"The best experience when I was in Singapore馃槉 but the ticketing locket is far from the gate. Nice staff, good cleanliness",,,
,,Great view above f1 track and of the bay,5,,"It's a huge Ferris wheel, it's not a roller coaster, it's not fast, it's peaceful. Let's get that established, I've read some reviews complaining that it isn't more like the aforementioned. It's the largest in the world and it has some amazing views. Yes these views can be seen from other places like marina bay sands etc but you can walk up and down the f1 track here too and it's a nice spot to look out over the water. The actual attraction is great, even better by night though!

The prices stated are steep we paid 35sgd each so 18gbp for it and it last about thirsty minutes. There are no drinks or snacks in the pods but lots of facilities around the base. You can walk over the road bridge from marina bay sands or use the helix and it takes 10 minutes.

Sit back, relax and take lots of pics, it's a great attraction and it's huge!",,,
,,Good one,4,,"If we you have been to the London eye, then this is something similar. Try going in the evening time to enjoy the day light as well as the night lights. I would avoid this if you are short on time.",,,
,,Great view of Singapore,4,,Worth the trip on the Ferris wheel. Capsule is roomy and have about 16 people sharing with you. Sunset views were magic and lights on the water looked beautiful. Travels very slow hardly feels like your moving. Enjoyed the ride.,,,
,,Osssmmm experience,4,,Anybody wanna experience like eagle eye guys do have a flyer experiece so that you could be able to watch the beauty of singapore from the top ... Better experiece this in day light as you could find light at night anywhere even from your hotel window,,,
,,Amazing Ride,5,,"Be prepared to spend about 1hour here, get here fairly early to avoid the ques.The views from this ride are fantastic and you should add it to your Singapore to do list.",,,
,,Tourist Trap! Can Avoid it!,1,,"The flyer go stop every few minutes and after sometime you just feel trapped in the capsule.

The better option to enjoy the view if sungapore from a height is to go to Marina Bay Sands deck which is not only cheaper option but also give you more time to enjoy the view.

The other option is to go to one of the many roof top restaurants and bars where you can enjoy the view and have a drink or dinner.",,,
,,nice views,4,,We got the cabin for ourselve. Very nice views. Look at the weather after we left they closed because risk of thunder. One weekdays there was not a long queu. Expensive.,,,
,,Singapore sling flight,5,,Prebooked a Singapore sling flight..... fortunately for us no one else had selected a Singapore sling flight in the same time slot.....so we had the capsule to ourselves. Felt very special the 2 of us in a specially decorated capsule with our slings in hand.,,,
,,singapore flyer experience,5,,great view..we saw almost of the Singapore.even some islands of Malaysia and some island near Singapore.first time family experience...we had so much fun and we took a lot of beautiful pictures..our boys had so much fun.it was so relaxing up there.,,,
,,Great views,5,,We went on the Flyer in the day and enjoyed the great views. I am sure it would be wonderful at any time of day.,,,
,,Great Ride for Kids,5,,Absolutely a must do if you have li'll one aged 5- 12 yrs ! Best time to visit is between 1800hrs to 1830 hrs ...you'll get to see both day & night view of Singapore skyline. Do try the flight simulator in same complex. However you need to book it two days in advance....absolutely worth the money spent !,,,
,,Nice attraction and good for first timers,4,,"Visited with kids at little late evening and it was not much crowded.

Entered inside in few minutes. Gondola was huge. Place where people get in was little bit scary since no fencing or safety wall.

Got in to gondola and it was size of big room. It took 30mins to complete one round. View was beautiful and since gondola is of glass you get a view of complete marina bay or most of the part of singapore.

Enjoyed ride. You can visit Atleast once or in other words its a attraction worth visiting once.

Best time to visit is just before sunset.",,,
,,Highly recommended! Once in a lifetime experience.,5,,"It was my first solo trip to visit friends in Singapore. My friend planned everything including a night ride on the Singapore Flyer!
Although claimed that each capsule can fit up to 28 passengers, we shared a capsule with less than 10. It is a good thing as I am claustrophobic and acrophobic.
Night view from the capsule is breathtaking!",,,
,,Superb!!!!,5,,"After a tiring day this was just awesome, not only it gave us the best view of Singapore but also relaxed us for full 30 min. It was a slow ride with a spectacular view. amazing especially in the evening. I find this better than the one in Osaka ferris wheel.
Worth the money.",,,
,,best skyview,5,,"this one by far was the best experience we had in singapore ,a must must for everyone.what a fantastic view .we advice you go in late evening",,,
,,My,4,,"We did it early morning before most of the tourist groups could join. Well organised, the employees were very helpful, you get a good view of Singapore from all angles.",,,
,,Great view and ride,5,,"I'm afraid of heights... And it's nerve racking. But the views of the gardens by the bay, the ocean, and Singapore's skyline are first rate. The views from This are better than on Manderlay Bay, and it's pretty affordable. The ride is slow so plenty of picture time. Air con in capsule I could see getting stuck with a huge group not being very fun, luckily we had one family with us.",,,
,,Beautiful sight,4,,"The sight or view for daytime or evening time ride is different. Daytime you can see most of Singapore and evening time will be the spectacular night lights of Singapore. It solely depends on what you looking for. The best view will be when your carriage is on the top and you can take in a 360 degree view from the capsule. Its a good experience for those that have are new to Singapore or want to know more about Singapore. The ride is slightly expensive but its worth it. It can be easily accessible by taxi, bus or even by MRT",,,
,,Excellent View,5,,I went up with two people with a fear of heights. After stepping on board the capsule the fear was gone. Make sure you book the special with a little bit of wine while your on the ride.,,,
,,Must visit sight,5,,"Awesome view for Singapore harbour. One circle is pretty enough to understand how beautiful the city is. Visit it during the day, it won't be a lot of people at cabin.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"We enjoyed our ride on the Singapore Flyer. There were only 7 of us in the capsule so could get great views all round. I guess this would be more limited if you were in a bigger group. The entry and exit were smooth as was the whole ride. The weather was quite clear so could see a fair distance. Enjoyed feeding the fish afterwards in the rainforest garden.
A great way to get a good perspective on the city of Singapore. Looks great too at night time all lit up although we only visited in the day.",,,
,,Love it,5,,Best way to get a view of the whole town we did the one in London this is our second one it's about 30 minutes to ago around o but trust me it's a great way to spend the day with the kids and great for pictures I mean amazing pictures,,,
,,Great experience,5,,"Great experience, fantastic views, takes about half an hour, do it add part of a hop on hop off bus trip",,,
,,What a beautiful view of the city!,5,,"I am absolutely terrified of heights but didn't want to be left alone while everyone went on this amazing Ferris Wheel. Now first its super high, super scary and I thought it would move like a traditional Ferris Wheel car but it does not. Its incredibility stable and I don't think it moved at all. That said you absolutely must do this!!! I was told the line can be quite long but we got lucky and essentially walked right on. If your in Singapore, you will never forgive yourself if you fail to ride this, even if your afraid of heights!",,,
,,It's ok !,4,,"For photo and see Singapore from above its cool , maybe you will remember London eye in that place as I did !! The ticket was 33 for adult and 21 for kids and the ride almost 10 to 15 minutes.",,,
,,Birds eye view,5,,Excellent 360 degree view....Good value for money...spacious capsule with seats to sit down..Takes around 30 minutes to go all the way round,,,
,,Awesome!,5,,"You haven't seen Singapore unless you hv taken a ride in the Singapore flyer. Although expensive for 33$ ,it's money well spent.",,,
,,Fantastic Views,5,,"Although it is not cheap to go for a ride on the flyer, the views you get are brilliant. Although it turns very slowly, we found that it was over all to quickly.",,,
,,Great city views,4,,Good views of the city and surrounding areas. Was a little bit pricey as a family $110 for 2 adults and 2 kids. Fairly good food court at the bottom. Cars were air conditioned and it wasn't very busy when we were there (Saturday in July) so we only shared the car with 2 other people.,,,
,,see from the top,5,,unique experience to see singapore from the top. opportunity for picture taking. also you can dine with reservation. there are electronic presentation on the development of singapore and changes of the skyline.,,,
,,Lifetime experience - Bird's eyeview of Singapore City,5,,"165 metres in height, it is truly a giant wheel and a life time experience anyone visiting Singapore to try this 35 minute giant wheel flyer.. it is slow in its motion as it rotates - with each spoke having a cabin with transparent glass for viewing the entire city, can hold up to 8 people inside with TVs on both sides and the whole experience is like getting into an aircraft with security checks and other precautions. There is a belief that @ 90 degrees position of the wheel, one's wish of prosperity and becoming rich will come true- if one meditates at the point. Man's creation of a great experience... yet another WOW experience here..",,,
,,My first Ferris Wheel ever - no regrets!,5,,"Definitely a worthwhile experience. Not too cheap, but definitely worth it. We weren't too sure what time the Flyer shut, so we raced from Gardens by the Bay and managed to make it before it shut at 10pm. It takes about half an hour to make a full circle and the night lights were incredible, particularly from 165m high. If I were able to go again, would definitely go during sunset - I think that would be spectacular.",,,
,,Yes. Do it.,5,,Yes. Do it. So much nicer than the one in London. Spectacular views...such great pics. I think better to go during the day...the lights on the flyer would be distracting at night...and pics would be better during the day.,,,
,,It's ok!,4,,"There are many similar project in the World, but here you can view the Marina Bay, and Malysia & ohter many interesting places.",,,
,,Night lights galore.,5,,This is an absolute must do! Try and time your trip for either 7.40pm or 8.40pm as you not only get all the city lights but you can see the light show from Gardens by the Bay from above.,,,
,,the one to beat london or a me too?,5,,"London eye seems to have inspired this one.they have added more masala to it.there is an aircraft simulator,you can drive Ferrari also for a price....",,,
,,Great Singapore Sling Flight,5,,"I reserved to visit Singapore Flyer as Singapore Sling Flight (Fly with signature cocktail drink) on 9.30pm. Before fly, I was warmly welcomed by staff. Normal queue was able to ignore according to this reservation.

During the flight, flyer slowly moved. I amazed with nice view of Singapore.

After flight, I was impressed by staff who informed me how the fastest way to back to hotel. Awesome!",,,
,,No 1 Must Do in Singapore,5,,I had a few hours in Singapore on a business trip - This is a must for anyone especially those who want to 'see it all' in a short time. The view from the flyer is amazing and gives you a real feel for the city. It helped me map out where I wanted to go next.,,,
,,Great way to see Singapore,4,,"This is a great way to see a lot of Singapore in one go. Would be helpful to know what different buildings/areas were. We went during the day, night time would have been impressive. Full circle takes about 30 mins. Very accessible from Promenade MRT with a short walk. Lots of other food, shops etc in the building also.",,,
,,BIRTHDAY VISIT,5,,"My self and my wife went here prior to an evening out in the city, we chose a twilight trip as the sun would be going down, and the city lights coming on, wow wow wow.
What a view and although we had a few people in our pod, we had good views of the city with ample time to take many many photos, put this on you list of things to do whist in Singapore.",,,
,,Great view,5,,Wonderful view from the top of the flyer and the biggest in the world. Took it at sunset and great setting.,,,
,,Mesmerising,5,,Visited this attraction on the day of Main Race (F-1) 2015. Excellent sightseeing to view the huge and domination Singapore Skyline. I wanted to see the city as well as at the same time firecrackers at the end of Grand Prix. Was alone in the entire capsule so felt very royal & happy to explore.,,,
,,Excellent view,5,,"Excellent experience for anyone: children, teens and adults! Amazing and breathtaking views of the city and incredible for taking memorable photos! A must in Singapore!",,,
,,Up up and away!,5,,"The cable cars experience is definitely heaven, while the Singapore Flyer is Chilling Happiness combined with continuously heaven specially to newlyweds ! A must try!",,,
,,Flyer Experience,5,,"Must Visit for the family to experience the excellent Views of Marina Sands, Marina Bay and city Views, Every moment in there you wonder the beauty of Singapore- Sea side view. .....",,,
,,Must see in Singapore,5,,Great experience! You get to see a good view of Singapore. Getting to the top was the most exciting part. Noticed they had dinner tables on some capsules and would like to try it some time. Need to have bathroom break before hopping on because one full round takes about 30 minutes.,,,
,,For a view you wont forget,4,,"This wheel is one of the stops for the hop on, hop off bus tour of Singapore and well worth the money and dont forget your camera.",,,
,,not thrilling,3,,initially i was very excited. Once i started to ride..there was no feeling...not worth for money.better to opt some other good things in Singapore like underwater sea planetarium,,,
,,Fantanstic skyline at night,4,,"Fantastic skyline at night Expensive price though for child. If you have extra money, why not, otherwise maybe next time",,,
,,Beautiful views,5,,"From the flyer you can see the whole city and beyond. It was worth the price and the wait was minimal. We went at dusk and got the best of both, the city views and the nighttime lights. A great attraction, well worth a ride.",,,
,,Fantastic views...........,5,,"If you travel to fabulous Singapore the Flyer is a must...............Views of the sea, the City, the GP race track are fantastic....Fantastic",,,
,,Take you guests a must see.,4,,This is an experience not to be missed in Singapore - take your guests. Easy and hassle free and if you time it correctly no long lines. The view is amazing and 45 minutes is good value for money. Make sure you go. Enjoy.,,,
,,Singapore by night,5,,"Amazing views of Singapore at night from our capsule. Very slow and comfortable with great panoramic views. Felt very stable and safe. Even our ""afraid of heights"" teenager managed to pry herself off the seat to capture a few selfies for her profile! Highly recommend",,,
,,Walking Night Tour inclusion,5,,Worth the night cap. Imagine all the walking and nonstop walking for this very unique experience. Safe. Sturdy. Dramatic.,,,
,,Good thing to do to kill time,4,,We went here whilst getting off the duck tour - fun well organised easy to see everything takes about 30 mins got some good photos - wish there was commentary or music or something in there though. All in all good touristic activity,,,
,,Flying High!,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is the highest Ferris wheel in Asia that offers spectacular 360 degree views of Singapore city. Marina Bay,Gardens by the bay, the formula one race track etc. are just a few of the landmarks that can be seen from a bird's eye view in air conditioned comfort. One full circuit lasts about half an hour and is well worth the price in my opinion.",,,
,,Wonderful views,4,,The singapore flyer is good but its something that you probably wouldn't do again after already doing once. The views are amazing at the top and you can see singapore from just about every angle.,,,
,,Average,3,,Visited Singapore flyer just few days ago.I found the flyer average and overrated. SGD 33 is too much. However the view is good.,,,
,,Amazing views!,5,,This was a wonderful way to see Singapore from high up. The wheel turns quite slowly and you have ample time to take in the magnificent views. Highly recommended!,,,
,,Fantastic views!,5,,"We walked up to the Singapore flyer as it wasn't too far from where we were staying. Admittedly I'm afraid of height but once we got on the flyer it was absolutely fantastic. Went nice and slow, so got a great views of Singapore and some awesome photos. The only thing that freaked me out was getting on and off the flyer with small kids but had great assistance doing it. As usual everywhere tourist-y in Singapore you have to exit out from a gift/souvenir shop which is always a hassle when you've got kids that want things from the shops! Only real expense there.",,,
,,Lookin out SG from the above,4,,"Actually nice ride we can see part of SG city from the above. But wondering if it become more less attractive, only few people and with my family whose waiting in the line to ride up.",,,
,,Nice attraction,3,,Some 35 mins ride in flyer and you can see whole singapore in 360 degrees... skyline... marina bay sands... gardens by the bay... and more... we preferred the day view rather than the night...,,,
,,Ok but expensive,3,,This was enjoyable with the great views over Singapore but we felt that the price was a bit excessive. Would have been better with a commentary explaining the different views.,,,
,,An awesome way to see this beautiful city,5,,"Anticipating similar lines to the London Eye, we booked online hoping to avoid some queues. We were dismayed that we couldn't select a ride time, but proceeded with online booking anyway. Lucky for us however, 8pm on a Saturday, is not when a lot of people choose to visit the Singapore Flyer! No lines at all. The biggest challenge and only criticism was the completely inadequate signage from the MRT. This needs fixing. However once we were there, it was an incredible experience. A clear night, and a car with less than half the max load helped lots I am sure, but the sites are something pretty special.",,,
,,Amazing view from the top,5,,"It was a very quiet ride, we had the whole gondola for our selfs. It was a bit clowdy but the veiw was fantastic. We had a birds eye view of almost the whole city. Very good sightseeing and worth to visit and ride but, may be not recomendable for acrophobics.",,,
,,Awesome Experience,4,,This is one of the best experience I had ever been through. Beautiful view from the big cabins. The ride takes approx 45 mins.,,,
,,Seeing Singapore from the sky,5,,It like the London eye. the base of the ride has many restaurants and it a nice walk from the esplanade which is another attention of its own.,,,
,,Great View from Top,5,,It will be superb experience and amazing view from top of the Flyer . Must do attraction for Foreign Visitors .,,,
,,Dinner with a view,4,,We booked the dinner trip on the Flyer and enjoyed reasonable food and a great view. Not cheap (especially the drinks) but a great experience.,,,
,,Been befire,5,,We visited the flyer with one grandchild & her parents. It was our 2nd visit and we came from Australia. Very disappointed that no discount for pensioners from Australia. As we had been before it was just about sharing the experience with our granddaughter. The weather was not the best but nevertheless it was enjoyable.,,,
,,Stunning,5,,Such a perfect way to see the whole of Singapore without the need to do more and sit and look out at the amazing place that is Singapore. Fascinating to see so how many ships in the harbour with all their lights on. Very pretty.,,,
,,Beautiful experience,5,,"Singapore flyer is one of the most iconic tourist attractions in Singapore. It stands tall and provides mesmerizing view of Singapore skyline and coast line.

I personally enjoy the night view, with the entire city lit up like a beautiful doll.

The capsules are really stable, it's a good family activity. Romantic meals can be arranged within the capsules, menu is usually available at the tickets counter. If you decide to skip the meal part, there are lot of food options available in the vicinity.

Certainly good to try once, enjoy it with your family and loved ones.

Kids and wheel chair friendly.",,,
,,Best veuie of the City,5,,"Our aim it to ride every Bid wheel around the world so when we visit a city that has one, it is on our to do list, now crossed this one off the list. ""Great"".",,,
,,What a great view of Singapore,4,,"We did this during the day and the sky was perfect for seeing just how big Singapore really is for such a small island. We managed a carriage all to ourselves and this allowed us to take advantage of each aspect of the view, loved it.",,,
,,Magnificent,5,,"This was a lifetime experience, magnificent views. We did it in the daytime but would have loved it even more at night",,,
,,Magnificent views at night ....,5,,"It's the second highest Ferris wheel of the world. And truth to be told, you can feel it's grandness when you are hanging on the topmost point!!!

The entry towards the ride is very unique. There are couple of rooms containing different things. In one you can see laser shows. In another there are miniature model of the flyer and all the science behind it. So that u understand what you are going to have before going on it.

After riding on the flyer... the experience is breathtaking. The night view of Singapore city!!! It's too good.... you can see everything around you clearly... when at top, you can almost see everything just like a picture.... I recommend to go at evening than daylight... it's a must have experience when you are in Singapore...",,,
,,Singapore ( Super ) Flyer,5,,Wonderful experience. Really thrilled. Never been to such a huge flyer. Words are not enough to express the excitement underwent ; one shd personally experience the same. Only regret is that not enough direction/instruction is available leading to the flyer. Good luck to Singapore n the persons created the flyer,,,
,,Laid back experience,4,,There is nothing bad to say about this attraction. The views are beautiful and the time spent in the capsule was relaxing. All in all a very laid back experience. Perfect if you are looking for some down time.,,,
,,See the whole city from here,5,,"If you want to see the whole city , you can take a ride on this. The whole ride takes around 1.5 hours. It is advisable to take the ride during evening time.",,,
,,OMG it's high!,4,,"This thing is big! Like, really big! It does live up to the name and when your near the top it does feel like your in a plane it's that high. The ride takes about 30 minutes and offers panoramic views of Singapore. My wife and I did get a touch of vertigo about three quarters of the way up so if your not good with heights be warned the capsules are very open and once your in, your in for the duration of the ride! The wheel and the building housing it are both looking tired and shabby however. Both could do with some refurbishment to get them back to five star condition. We went on a quiet day and bought our tickets in under five minutes and got a capsule to ourselves, much to the delight of our one year old son who could crawl about and stand at the Windows.",,,
,,Magnificent!!!,5,,"It's the second highest Ferris wheel of the world. And truth to be told, you can feel it's grandness when you are hanging on the topmost point!!!

,,Great view,4,,"Brilliant view of this amazing city. Highly organised but is costly for the 30 minute attraction, especially for family of four.",,,
,,Amazing view from the top,5,,"Amazing place to be with your family and friends. The security is very right. The flyer your was for 30 minutes. You can see the almost the whole city from there. It's located in central business area in Singapore. Just take a taxi from any stand and ask to go to marina bay, Singapore flyer. Its better if you go at night. The gardens by the bay looks amazing from the top. The ticket price was 33 Singaporean dollar for adults. The fare for senior citizens is lower but you will only get it if you travel in Singapore airline..!! To me, it's not care. After the side you will get to enjoy the serenity to marina bay. Highly recommended for the tourists.",,,
,,Worth the $ for fabulous experience.,5,,"This is not an inexpensive undertaking, but it's well worth it. The views from the Flyer are spectacular. Our teenage children really loved this. There's plenty of time to take photos and enjoy the panoramas I. Air conditioned comfort. I would recommend this if you are visiting Singapore.",,,
,,breathtaking views,5,,"We did the night time ride, you get to see the light show which is breathtaking and memorizing. The Capsule gives you awesome access to all views of the city, thought it was going to be scary but wasn't, hardly felt like we were moving. Great company in the capsule, got to chat to others and share the photo taking.",,,
,,Must see for Foreign visitors.,5,,Brilliant to see the whole of singapore in one go. Night views are definitely better than day one. Try to ride at around 7 pm after sunset. Very close to Promenade MRT!,,,
,,View from top of world,4,,"If you want to have a bird view of most famous business district, garden by way or even super tree, Flyer is must. One rotation takes about 25-30 mins and gives you amazing view of singapore. It can be bit boring for small kids but me snd my wife enjoyed the experience and view from world highest flyer.",,,
,,Night time the best,5,,"We were glad we went at night as the lights of the city were beautiful, suffer from travel sickness but no problems only had 8 in the cabin, it was about 9,00pm.",,,
,,Wow! Just Wow!,4,,"So, even though we've been on other giant ferris wheels around the world we still needed to do this one. Well, it was fabulous! Not only did we get to enjoy the stunning views, but every time I go on one of these I witness someone proposing!! It makes it all the more exciting.

If you go in the late afternoon and time it right for sunset you will see the day and night views. Just check your phone for sunset times.",,,
,,Nice scenery,3,,"well, if you have time and have nothing else to do. Need some time to enjoy Singapore view. This would be something nice to do to kill some extra time.

But if you are like me..that likes excitements and not wasting time. Maybe not, coz you will be trap on the flyers for about 30-40 mins before you can come down. Basically nothing to do when you are on it. just look at the view.

FYI it can be crowded sometimes. and u might not have any space to sit. When i was in it with my partner, there were some kids shouting and running around. so we had to go through that for 40 mins. :(

over all. SUPER nice view. BEST for couples and family",,,
,,Allows a Nice View of Singapore,3,,"The Flyer had long lines when we visited. It was initially enjoyable, but then seemed to go on forever with small children who ran around like crazy disturbing all of the other passengers. The views are particularly nice in the evening.",,,
,,Copy finish of london eye.,5,,As my title very clearly states that the flyer was not anything more than the London eye but nevertheless nothing less than it either.The capsules were very well air conditioned and clean.Also the view was breath taking...definitely should b top destination to anyone visiting the country.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,You can see the view of Singapore when you board the capsule. The capsuleis big and spacious. It is also air conditioned. Nice view for photography.,,,
,,Singapore flyer,3,,Very easy to buy tickets and find the flyer - no queues so quick and very friendly helpful staff. Good interactive exhibition as you walk through. Only downside is no map showing you what you are looking at when you go up in the flyer. None was offered and there was none on board. This makes it less exciting as it just becomes a view.,,,
,,nice place for short time visit.,3,,it is nice place for tourist but not for whole day visit. normally if we want to travel from Singapore to Malaysia. all buses took you from there. so directly indirectly you can see this place. :),,,
,,Spectacular Views. Enjoyable Ride,4,,"Each flyer unit has air conditioned and provides ample seating. Vary spacious and you can obtain views of the city, ocean and sky lone. You move along at a slow pace which allows you to take in all of the city. Worth the time as the views are awesome and the ride is soothing. Also a great place to escape the heat. Most tours stop here but also easily reached by cab and or car.",,,
,,Amazing a must do,5,,Wow what an awesome experience. If you go to Singapore and don't mind heights try the Flyer. Not to expensive and well worth it. I'm sure the night one would be great to. We went during the day. Stunning views.,,,
,,Good experience of the city,4,,"It was a good experience riding this Singapore Flyer as well as for my kids to get the total view of the city. Took us around 30 minutes to complete the experience. We went there in the afternoon while it is bright, it would be better if we could go around sunset though. Quite expensive but we got a lot of great photo shots. Afterwards, if you get hungry, you have choices of restaurants or food court. Would love to have somekind of shuttle bus to go to Marina Bay or Garden by the Bay as we still need to cross big bridge to that, instead of taking taxis.",,,
,,Fantastic views of Singapore,4,,"We did this on dusk so it was great to see the changing light over the city. You get some fantastic panoramic view across the landscape. Photography inside the cabins can be a bit hard due to reflections

Note that if you're a small group you may have to share it with other families that might have screaming children but the view more than makes up for it.

We went to do Marina Sands however due to the cost to access didn't do it because we decided that we'd already done the Flyer and got better value out of it . So for me if it's one or the other I'd be picking the flyer.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Great experience, thrilled ,we all had a great time on flyer, feel like a chopper round on Singapore can see all around from such height , good view and took lot of photos, love it",,,
,,Night time is the best time.,4,,"Taking somebody on the flyer with vertigo was always going to be a challenge, but by doing it at night it was a double bonus, as not only were they able to handle it and walk about the capsule to get a good vantage photo, but Singapore by night is quite a fantastic sight, as the gardens by the bay light up, and also the Marina Sands laser show kicks off at 8pm. Keep those cameras handy as you reach the apex of your ride, and for a few minutes you are above all of Singapore with a 360degree view of the entire city, then you slowly ride back down in your 40minute ride. Cost is around $33 dollars, but if flying with Singapore airlines, keep that boarding card handy as it earns you a ten per cent discount on the price. Then buy an ice cream at the stand outside and look up at where you have just been on the flyer. A fun way to spend the evening.",,,
,,Reminds me of London's Eye,5,,Same concept with the London's Eye. Great view from the TOP! Romantic place for couples to have a date - so sad that I don't have one. But very recommended place if you don't mind to spend a little bit more for sightseeing.,,,
,,Fun on the flyer,5,,"Great time, great views and about 30 minutes to do the full 360. I thought it was a bit expensive, but for a 30 minute ride made it worth it. Costly if you have a lot of children.",,,
,,Worth Visiting,4,,"Had a great time on the flyer, able to see much of Singapore City, the car's were very large with seating in the middle, it turned slow enough to have a good look around. Clean and good staff",,,
,,One of the top attractions,4,,There is more than the flyer here. Great food venue. The flyer gives good views overlooking other main attractions. this is a must on you travel itinerary.,,,
,,It can be boring,3,,"Simply is an elevated place to view Singapore within the Flyer's proximity. It can be boring, I suggest going as a family or big group. We tried this during noon time. Its air-conditioned inside but can be a little war depending where the sun's side is.
Another option if you are to skip Singapore Flyer is going up the Marina Bay Sands viewing-deck or if going to Garden's By the Bay, take the route inside the MBS mall near Chanel boutique & hop into the highest escalator.",,,
,,Great view of the city,4,,"My son and I (he's 13) went here on our recent trip to singapore. The capsule is fully enclosed and doesn't rock or swing, it doesn't have a glass bottom but the sides are fully glassed, so its good for people who are a little afraid of heights as i am. It moves really slowly so it feels like you're not moving at all, makes 1 rotation before you get off which takes around 30 minutes.",,,
,,Beauty,4,,Great way to experience Singapore from above. Just the right speed to allow you to take everything in and not feel too bothered by vertigo. Smooth and quick transition.,,,
,,Better than expected,4,,"I had been on the London Eye and thought the Singapore Flyer was just an imitation. However I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the ride. It is really nice and spacious, unlike the one in Hong Kong. It is at a great location offering a good view of the entire city and within walking distance to the Sands. The food vendors downstairs are great to have a quick taste of the local food.",,,
,,Not just a ferris wheel,5,,Had a recommendation to try the Singapore Flyer which looks much like others in Paris and London. I often wondered what is the advantage in taking a ride. I was quickly impressed as we commenced our slow ascent and saw the city of Singapore as never before. In air conditioned comfort I must have snapped up dozens of photos. This was truly a great and safe experience. Bag and metal detection checks are made prior to entry. Staff are very helpful and the whole thing professionally run. At $33 sgd per person for the half hour rotation it is great value and a must when visiting Singapore.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"The Singapore Flyer was easy to find not far from Raffles Hotel. Although I thought the flyer was a little expensive the cabins were quite large and with breathtaking views of Marina Bay Sands Hotel,Singapore city, the bay and surrounding area of Singapore.",,,
,,Nice view,4,,"We went to Singapore flyer a day before.. it was nice (went after dark) view was good... dint book the flyer tickets online as I had read that the flyer maybe stopped if it rains too heavily. However, buying tickets in person wasn't bad either.. the queue was fast moving! Would definitely recommend the flyer from an experience prospective, especially to those wo haven't been on London eye or something similar.",,,
,,Great views,4,,This is similar to the wheel in other cities around the world. On a clear day the views are terrific. They are very organized and the queues move quickly. Worth doing once!,,,
,,Best Views of Singapore!,5,,"This is almost identical to the London Eye: a super tall Ferris Wheel ride that is fully enclosed with air conditioning. Excellent views of the Singapore port and harbor and the dramatic skyline of the business district.

An excellent side view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel (the one with the ship on top). I really enjoyed this experience and recommend it! An easy walk from most anywhere in town. Approximately $33 per person.",,,
,,Loved It,5,,"A must do activity in Singapore. The views are awesome, the commentary inside the capsule is informative and compliments to ride. The activity is very well run and organised. The gardens are beautiful to explore around the Flyer and the restaurants in the area offer great deals.",,,
,,Great views from the top,5,,"Though the price for the Singapore Flyer is quite high, the view is simply amazing, as the car allows you to see every place in Singapore, and it is a great picture taking spot for the gardens and the city center. The wheel moves slowly enough so you have plenty of time to relax and enjoy the view. There are plenty of shops afterwards and the food street below features many local delicacies.",,,
,,Beautiful View,5,,The flyer gives you the all round view of Singapore in around 20 mins. If you want to click photos then visit during the daytime. If you want to see the Singapore Skyline then visit during the evening or night hours.,,,
,,Awesome views,5,,"Awesome views, worth the experience. Book in advance for additional packages such as cocktails/wine.",,,
,,Great View,5,,Worth doing for a great view of the city. It takes about 30 minutes. and in our experience we were only with 1 other couple so you don't get packed in with a big group. If you only have time for either the Singapore Flyer or Marina Bay Sands in my opinion this is better.,,,
,,What stunning views,5,,"Being scared of heights I wasn't so keen but so glad we did. The view was magnificent, even from my seated position. Encourage you to put this on the ""to do"" list too even those scared of heights",,,
,,Night sky,5,,"Very fun, very beautiful, very romantic! We went when it was still light half way around the sun started to set! So beautiful! It takes about 30 minutes, you really don't realize that you are moving. If you are afraid of heights don't worry. It is very comfortable. No lines great places to eat close by, plus right by hop on hop off! A must do!",,,
,,Fantastic,5,,Highly recommend everyone going on the Singapore Flyer....well worth the money. It is an experience you will always remember. Plenty of room for everyone to see the views and it goes around very slowly so ample opportunity to see the city and take great photos. A must to do when in Singapore.,,,
,,Views of Singapore,3,,"30 minutes in a pod on a ferris wheel to see the sights of Singapore.
Just hope that you do get a pod like we did with children in who constantly ran around, jumped, screamed and shouted while their parents just sat and took photographs of them.
I got some beautiful panoramic views when we got to the top and saw the grand prix pits and starting line.
There is no map inside the pod so if you are a tourist then you may not know what you are looking at.
I'm not sure it was worth $33 dollars, but then if you had a quiet pod and knew what you were seeing then it may be for you.

Don't bother with the souvenir photo, it is $25 to have a green screen photo imprinted on to various backgrounds.",,,
,,Worth it for first time visitors,5,,"Nice 30 minute ride to enjoy panoramic view of Singapore. Better to go at night, beautiful view with all the lights.",,,
,,Awsome Experience,5,,It was awsome experience and must visit when you are in Singapore.Superb view of Singapore from the flyer.Such a fantastic view of city .,,,
,,Night views amazing,5,,We went on the eye just as the sun had gone down. The views were amazing with the lights of the city. It took about half and hour to go round so had plenty of time for a good look. Would recommend if you would like an overall view of the city.,,,
,,NOT TO BE MISSED,5,,"Despite my fear of heights, I am so glad I decided to take a 30 minute ride on the Singapore Flyer. Luckily, the day was a fine, clear sky day and the view from the Flyer was amazing. Was great to try and pick out landmarks that we had visited on foot.",,,
,,Great View,4,,"We came early to miss the crowds as it opens at 8:30am. We were not disappointed. The ride, while pricey offers a grand view of the city. Not to be missed. It is pay per visit so if you want a night ride you must pay again. Clean restrooms and courteous staff. Location can handle wheelchairs and has refreshment stands. There is also a retro 60's local restaurant and a nice koi pond.

Definitely was worth being there early as we had the full 28-man car to ourselves.",,,
,,Worth the experience,4,,Great place with great view of Singapore city. Very innovative and worth visiting with whole family. Prices are a bit steep but overall good experience. Book tickets online to avoid standing in queue. Plenty of eating options and some sovenier shops around too.,,,
,,Wonder in sky,5,,It is a wonderful visit for seeing the landscape of Singapore from the highs. It gives a thriller excitement too. The compartment is large and secure too. A good experience for every one however it is little costly too.,,,
,,Class,5,,"Must stop destination where you can have a view of complete city

If one would like to see Indonesia island than i must prefer him to visit in day time / you can get the view of same

If you wanna have a view of high Rise Building with beautifull light than must go in the evening",,,
,,Good view of singapore,4,,Its a good way to see the city and all its attractions. Good for families and a large group of people.,,,
,,Perfect view of the City,5,,This was a great experience. It took about 30 minutes to go all the way around and you get a beautiful view of the city. We did it during the day and it was perfect.,,,
,,"Good view of Singapre, especially at night",4,,"We went there at around 7.30pm (using MRT)
Don,t by the ticket at the window, its costly. I bought it on Klook app.
It gives you 360 degree view of Singapore city. At night, Garden by the bay, Marina Bay, and the whole city looks awesome.
There are street food like outlets just outside the Flywer. We had amazing Chinese street food for dinner, with Tiger beer.",,,
,,"Good views, pretty reasonable price",3,,"Killing time in Singapore and decided to have a look at the Flyer. I went mid week, so few crowds, the price was good, around $25. The pods a re very large and roomy (I only had one other person in mine). The whole circuit takes around 45 minutes - the views are pretty good. Worth a look",,,
,,Did as part of larger tour,4,,Great views of the city. The eye is very slow and stable with AC in each car. Gives a good view of the F1 track,,,
,,Spectacular views!!,5,,"We went to the flyer during day time. It's a literally giant wheel having cabins allowing almost 20-25 people per cabin and it rotates slowly but continuously. A whole round of 365掳 takes around 40minutes but each minute spent inside is worth. The flyer is located near the bay having excellent views of the Bay, Gardens by the bay, Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore city. Every degree of rotation has a unique and awesome view! The city looks beautiful from the flyer.
The flyer experience is once in a lifetime!",,,

,,Excellent night views of Singapore!,5,,"We really enjoyed all the views of Singapore at night from our ride! The ride moves slow enough that we were able to catch really clear, very nice photos. I am scared of heights, but the bubble is entirely enclosed with thick glass/plastic, so it's secure enough for me, but some folks might have a problem with it (I know my mom would!). The compartment is very spacious and has a very large bench in the center of it.",,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Our family of 5 did the flyer a week ago. The best time if the night is to catch the 7pm curcuit to catch the lights from Gardens by the bay at the top. Depending on the season, depends on how busy it is but being june, we had a car to ourselves. Worth the visit and highly recommend. It is pricy though.",,,
,,Worth it,5,,"Price: S$33.00 ($44.50 US)
Time: 8.30am 鈥?10.00pm
Duration: 30 min

This is the world's largest fairest wheel, till China is done with theirs. I would take the opportunity to see all of Singapore, if you can. It's cool seeing the city on one side and the boats on the harder on the other.

Just FYI their is not much to eat around the area.",,,
,,Half hour of fabulous views,5,,"Took two young teenager boys on the flyer. Hard to impress at this age but they loved it. Went around 3.30 pm on a weekday and booked the Singapore Sling cocktail trip with mocktails for the boys. At that time of a weekday we had the pod to ourselves. The Flyer sits directly above Pit Lane for the Sept night F1 race. The kids took heaps of photos and although not there for the race, when we watch the it on TV in Sept we will relate to it.
Good value but half hour goes quickly.",,,
,,Great view,5,,Highly recommend this experience. Singapore is slowly revealed from east to west. Easy to get on and off and not too frightening for passengers who are a little wary of heights. Also amazing engineering information on the structure for anyone interested.,,,
,,Totally for tourist,3,,After 5 mins of the 30 min got bored. You see the view. Take pics. The end..30 sg. Same as the london flyer.,,,
,,Amazing view of the singapore,5,,"Step inside this ferry wheel and see it goes slowly to the top from where you can see most of the Singapore and its attraction. If you are on a honeymoon, dont forget to take the cocktail ticket or the butler service ticket.",,,
,,Good place to see Singapore bay area at a glance,4,,"Visited this on multiple occasions with friends and family. A few things to note about the place for people travelling -
1. There is a food court at Level 1 so a few choices of food are available
2. You can get a discount if you have SIA boarding pass or other forms of coupons
3. The flight as they call it is about 30 mins
4. Best to book online to beat the queue in a hot summer day
5. There is a fresh juice shop, a coffee place and other eating options to relax for a bit",,,
,,A Must Do,5,,We attended the flyer early evening on a Tuesday and there was basically no queue so we hopped straight on. Great views and informative commentary. Also took some amazing photos!!,,,
,,Singapore flyer at night,5,,No wait on long lines. Friendly staff. One of the views. Of Singapore city besides Marina bay sands hotel rooftop. Last for about half an hour plenty of time to take good pictures,,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,If you're travelling to singapore you should put singapore flyer your things to do list :) breathtaking view of the city.,,,
,,Full view of Singapore skyline,5,,Provides you with a 30 minutes ride on the Singapore flyer. Gives a full skyline view of Singapore. Has reserved cabins as well for dinner/lunch.,,,
,,Sunset Ride,5,,"We had a wonderful ride with cocktails! The view was incredible. The Flyer goes slowly so you don't really feel that it is moving. Each car fits 28 people, there are 28 cars, and the ride is 28 minutes long!!!",,,
,,moving view of singapore,5,,"Is it worth it? Depends on what you're looking for.

I think the Flyer is a good option if you hate wind and don't like going to open air rooftops like the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark or 1-Altitude. It's also a good alternative if you have kids and can't bring them to a fancy rooftop bar late at night.

Important things to note:
- The flight is unguided. If you're just interested in taking pictures, it's good, but if you're looking to learn more about your surroundings, it's not going to cut it.
- This is NOT the best place if you want a good photo of Marina Bay Sands. You only see the side of it, not a... full frontal shot, if you will!

For the first 15 minutes, you'll get good views of the National Stadium, Marina Bay Golf Course, Gardens By The Bay, Marina Barrage, and on a really good day, you could see Indonesia.

The last 15 minutes is best to focus on Gardens By The Bay (again), ArtScience Museum, the city skyline, The Float at Marina Bay, Helix Bridge, and Esplanade Theatres on the Bay.

Believe it or not, what could bring more local foot traffic to the Flyer is their venue space. It's worth looking into if you're an event planner with a good budget.",,,
,,Not that great,3,,"I went there after with my Wife and 11yr Son and 7yr Daughter. We were not alone in the capsule, a couple joined us. We went in the after noon. We had our lunch at the flyer then we went for the ride. I was not really amazed, SG flyer is not the highest. Across the street, you can get access to Marina Bay Sands (MBS)which is higher and cheaper. you are not limited by time and you are high all the time. more importantly, taking photos will be much better from (MBS).",,,
,,Superb views,5,,The flyer is easily accessible via the SMRT. There are a few places to eat and drink. The views of Singapore on the flyer are superb and it goes round very slowly so you are able to move around inside the large capsule and see landmarks. There is a gift shop when you disembark which has a good selection of souvenirs/ gifts. Well worth a visit,,,
,,Too good,5,,"Awesome thing to experience in singapore
If you havnt seen this , you havnt visited singapore
Love the experience to be on the top
Its a ride of 30 mins for $ 33
You can click hell lots of picture here and can see whole of singapore from here",,,
,,Aerial ecstasy!,5,,"Splendid! That's the one word that comes to your mind when you are at the top.
We visited this place in the evening and when we went to buy the tickets, the guy at the counter suggested us to wait for half an hour so that we could enjoy a better view. So when we were going up, it was not so dark and on our flight down, we could see the entire city lit up. The view of Gardens by the bay was amazing from the top.

It was a wonderful and memorable experience.",,,
,,If you ever come to Singapore...,5,,"If you ever come to Singapore or if you live in here this is one attraction you must visit. It is amazing, the views are just take your breath away it is almost like being on a magic carpet. If you really want to see all of Singapore this is the best way to do it, if you do not have your own helicopter.",,,
,,Amazing Experience,4,,the view from the top is just amazing. one of the coolest things I've seen. the city looks beautiful with all the night lights.,,,
,,Good Service Staff,4,,I brought both my parents who were wheel-chaired bound. The staff even stopped the flyer to ensure my parents on their wheelchairs got in the capsule safely and comfortably to enjoy the beautiful view of Singapore. They were so happy to be able to get a ride on the flyer.,,,
,,Nice views but still only a flyer,4,,"We arrived late (21:30) on a weekday and there was almost nobody else, good!
There is a sort of science museum that we skipped completely and went on to board the flyer.
The ride is OK, during the night you get a nice view of the skyline and surroundings, but the nearby gardens don't shine.
A bit on the expensive side (33SGD).",,,
,,A must try,5,,We enjoyed the Singapore Flyer Ride. It was slow but interesting. We could see the entire city through the flyer.,,,
,,Good place,4,,Good place. You can normally visit this on a city tour which ladta for about 4-5hours. Good view. Nothing extra ordinary but you should visit if you have got time.,,,
,,ah the View !!,4,,"good way to view singapore..Those with kids,there is absolutely nothing to fear..once inside the flyer.u won't even feel that its moving...once at the highest point,you will feel elated with view of Merina bay sands and garden by the bay...however, if you have already done similar thing before at London or Dubai ,then you might avoid and opt for some other option - a short duration cruise ...",,,
,,Somewhat Slow and Boring but Definetely a Great View From the Top,3,,I kind of expected a good fast ride in the Flyer but I did not thought that it would be very slow like around thirty to forty five minutes. I was just sitting there and taking some pictures and was there with plenty of people. Nontheless it was a really great view from the top and you wont get to get the same experience elsewhere in Singapore. I wont say I love it but I also wont say I hated it because I had a good time. I'll just have to give it an average.,,,
,,Visit at dusk for maximum impact,4,,"Mostly under-rated due to its similarity to the London Eye, it's a good alternative for those who have not the time or resources to visit the UK. Each round trip lasts half an hour, and for maximum effect you should visit at dusk: see the sunset as you go up, then watch the city of Singapore light up as night comes down with you.",,,
,,Mermerizing,5,,"It was a wonderful experience. You get a beautiful view of the city and the tickets are not very expensive.

Here are a few suggestions though:
1. Plan your ride around sunset time, so that you get the daylight view of the city and by the time you are half way up, you can see the night lights as well.

2. plan your trip during weekdays, so that when its not too crowded, you might end up getting your own private capsule.

3. Don't buy any souvenirs from there, you can get almost the same souvenirs from China town as less than half the cost.",,,
,,nice view of singapore and sea,5,,its nice view of entire singapore and the ships approaching/departing on the sea shores. The flyer is a tall wheel which moves really really slow.,,,
,,Excellent views of Singapore,5,,"Having experienced similar wheels in other cities (Seattle and Las Vegas), we had to try the Singapore wheel as well. We were ""not"" disappointed. The wheel takes approximately 25-30 minutes for one revolution. You share the pod with about 7-8 other people, but have plenty of space to get up, walk around, and get your photos! Excellent views of most of what Singapore has to offer. Definitely a must do if in Singapore. Cost is 33 Singapore Dollars per person and is within walking distance from metro station. Truly enjoyed the experience.",,,
,,Worth a visit,4,,Cost SGD30 or so per person. Definitely worth doing once. Brilliant views of Singapore on a nice day.,,,
,,Flyer,5,,That was very very very intresting experience and i enjoy it Go and visits flyers You can see Singapore in 30 minutes,,,
,,Wonderful experience,5,,"This was my first time on any flyer/giant wheel, and I was somewhat apprehensive. However, the experience was simply great! The wheel moves very slowly and in a smooth way, so you don't feel the movement at all. Since we took the ride after dark, the skyline was absolutely beautiful and stunning!",,,
,,Bird's eyeview of the city,4,,"Located in between Suntec and Marina Bay Sands. Different views in the day and night. There are eateries there so you can dine either before or after. You could also book the whole capsule for celebrations. I've also tried their in-capsule dinning - 3 course dinner. Overall, nice experience but won't go back again soon unless there are other activities and promos.",,,
,,a unique experience,5,,"This is not the usual type of 'flyer' ... this is an experience to well and truly enjoy. Singapore has many experiences that are worth enjoying for everyone at all times. But the Singapore Flyer is a unique experience and all visitors should take the time to enjoy it.

Everyone attends the Zoo, the Botanical Gardens, Gardens By The Bay, Changi Museum etc.... but why not have the Singapore Flyer right up there amongst the top five?

So do please put this experience on your MUST DO list.",,,
,,Wow what a view,5,,The Singapore Flyer was one of the best things we did. We had views from every direction over the whole city. We nearly went again that night to capture the night scene. A must do,,,
,,Singapore view,3,,"It is good enough for a one time experience, and best viewed when at night with the city lights lited up. Movement is slow and is perfect for those skyline viewers.",,,
,,Outstanding views,5,,"Had pod to ourselves, better value than London Eye. You get a history of how it was built. The views are outstanding and you see the Marina Bay Sands from a very different angle, and the Singapore race track from on high, stunning",,,
,,Mesmeriaing view,5,,One of the best to do thing being in Singapore visit is riding in a flyer. The whole city could be fetched in shory duration of time. Cityscapes river ride and sea etc is an eye catching tour in 30 mins of ride.,,,
,,Can see the whole Singapore from up here,5,,"Rode once, and will not ride again for quite some time. Not because I dont like it, but because I want to ride it again with my family as it takes about an hour to complete the ride and I really dont want to spend such long time alone in one of its carriages haha. Very nice view though.",,,
,,Sky high delight,5,,"The day was hot and hardly a cloud in the sky as we made our way to the entrance of this magnificent structure. Whilst some delight was certainly to be found actually travelling in the predominantly glass ""pod"", there is much to admire regarding the construction, although I have been told that the ""London Eye"" is equally inspiring.
Whilst there were a number of people milling about, we purchased a ticket for approximately 拢17 each quite quickly, and made our way through covered information lined corridors to the departure point.
Although there were a number of children and adults at the departure stage, the pod we were in had only 5 people and consequently the fabulous views over the Marina Bay,Gardens by the Bay, roadways, sea and shipping and the Singapore buildings (including the cranes of construction) were evident.
The rotational speed was minimal and it was hard at times to realise that we were actually moving. I think that not even a person scared of heights would find this challenging.",,,
,,Great views over Marina Bay,4,,"Ride took approx 30 minutes, great views of Marina Bay, flower dome conservatory, gardens by the Bay Area. Food available for purchase at The big wheel. Small tropical forest garden at base of wheel with waterfall and fish, worth visiting. Good air conditioning in each wheel cage.",,,
,,Simply superb,5,,"Singapore flyer is a real thrilling experience & one must enjoy it once he/she visit Singapore. 2nd tallest ( 165 mtrs height) after London wheels ( 167 mtrs). You get a full view of Singapore, Marina bay, commercial hub & glimpses of Indonesia.
Worth for spending ticket money ( 33 SGD per person)
It shows the world that how Singapore is technically advanced.",,,
,,Panoramic Views,5,,"A nice slow and relaxing way to end a busy day, views are tremendous and as it moves slowly there is plenty of opportunity for photographs.",,,
,,Great view,5,,We had a beautiful clear day so it was differently worth it. Queues was minimal. The views were spectacular but it was a one off.,,,
,,Very nice,4,,"Choose a time between 5.45p.m - 6.00 p.m to enter the flyer. As you will start your journey in day light & end up by dark by the time entire Singapore is glowing .

We got a great deal on tickets from asiatravel.com . You must check prior to booking it directly from counter.",,,
,,Singapore,5,,"It almost felt like you could see the whole off sinapore, wonderful views of gardens by the bay and marina sands !great time to ride would be about 7.30 when the whole city lights up !!Recommend also in same complex. pedicure with fishes , great experience! !",,,
,,Great view of Singapore.,4,,"We did the Sky Ride to get an overview over Singapore.
As we arrived early in the morning it was no waiting and no crowds, it was only us and one more couple in the ""capsule"".

We got good views of all sides of Singapore, and was all in all a good experience. If you have extreme fear of heights, this is maybe not for you, but we never felt scared or unsafe.

Price was SGD 33 per person. The whole thing took around 30 minutes.",,,
,,Amazing view,5,,A visit to Singapore will never be complete without a trip to the Flyer! Day or night the view is fantastic!,,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,One of the best choices I had was to take the flyer with my family. The view especially at 9am was spectacular. The serenity of the city and the pristine scenery makes it more captivating. I got a bit nervous when we were at the topmost since the ferry moves really slow...but closing my eyes made me relax while enjoying the music inside the capsule.,,,
,,A special time with family and a great way to orient and take in the view,5,,Worth a look and spending time around the facility. Great food down stairs and do have your feet munched by the fish! You'll see! I would go back,,,
,,"Great views! Worth the money.,",5,,"A bit expensive but you get your money's worth. We went at night so it was a beautiful outlook across the country, and to take in Singapore's skyline.",,,
,,Good experience with good view,4,,"I love this place. It was a good experience. We can see all Singapore in there. The flyer moved so slowly so we can really enjoy the view. It was rather hard to get there. After we visit Garden by the Bay we're planning to go there by MRT but cannot found the way, so we keep walking. It was very tired.
But it was compensate with the good view.
To going back at hotel we're using taxi but it was rather hard to get taxi.",,,
,,Great Fun,5,,We had so much fun in the Singapore Flyer since our group of 13 had a capsule to ourselves. The view from the top was very good. The movement of the Flyer was hardly discernable so it was very pleasant.,,,
,,One of the better 'wheels',5,,"Location is perfect for spectacular views over the city, the marina and out to sea. I enjoyed this wheel better than some others in other cities.",,,
,,Like the London Eye,4,,Quite similar to the London Eye onlybigger and takes more time to go one full circle. An enjoyable evening catching the sunset.,,,
,,Best place for evening in Sngapore,5,,"You can enjoy flyer ride apart from that there are lot of attractions like beautiful garden ,Merlion ,light and sound show ,a total enriched experience.",,,
,,An Excellent 360 degrees view of SG.,5,,"This place is perfect for those who want to see Singapore in just 30 minutes. It will give you an overview of what Singapore looks like in the sky. It's so high that the feels was really amazing. The gondolas are well structured so you don't have to worry about falling down. This is a must for those who want to bond with friends or families while taking a look at what Singapore looks like. Overall, fun and exciting. Perfect.",,,
,,Nice,4,,Want to see singapore skyline and neighboring islands? Then Singapore flyer is best choice. It takes about 30 minutes to finish one circle. Actually the movement is very slow.,,,
,,Good place for hanging out,5,,Best place to go in the evenings...can see the whole city and gardens by the bay.. When it lit up in the eve.,,,
,,"Wow, great view....even if heights give you the chills.",4,,"OK, admitted, I am not very happy at very high attractions. And this one really goes high. Yet, the whole structure and cabins gave me enough courage to ride this ferris wheel. And the views are phenomenal. Very much worth the SGD33 entrance fee. We go there by MRT Promenade and it takes a 10-15 min walk. Overall a must-do.",,,
,,Totally worth it!,5,,"We lucked out, no line and beautiful day. Great views, an adult amusement park-like ride. And then a short walk to Marina Bay. Perfect if you only have time for one sight to see",,,
,,Great views,3,,"If you are in Singapore and have time, this is one of the attractions to visit at least once to get a great view of Singapore and for great photos.",,,
,,Flyer better than skypark,4,,"Paid $33 a ticket also went to skypark at $23 a ticket flyer much better experience and worth the extra. When we went there was no waiting, compared to the huge crowds at skypark.",,,
,,Great views,4,,We took the flyer around 7:30 pm. I wanted to do the Singapore sling option but boyfriend didn't want to spend that much :) Drinks are SUPER expensive in Singapore. The views were great. Nice and relaxing ride,,,
,,Nice at sunset/night,4,,"A little expensive attraction but worth a visit during sunset or night time when the city lights up. The ride lasts around an hour, very nice view, aircon cabin with music.",,,
,,Great way to have a look at the city and skyline,4,,"Great 30 minute ride on the wheel which gives you a great view of the Singapore skyline, Meridian Sands Hotel, FI Track and the Gardens by the Bay. Worth having a ride",,,
,,Provides lovely views from a different prospective,5,,"We spend the day wondering around the whole of Marina bay, Gardens by the Bay, the Merlion Park etc. and walked over the flyer. It gave another lovely view looking back over Singapore and we found an icecream vendor as we came off with beautiful icecream sandwiches so cheap it was a lovely end to our day exploring.",,,
,,Slow,3,,"Good to see Singapore from the top but it's painfully slow. My suggestion especially if you're going with young restless kids, go for either Tiger tower in resorts world sentosa or marina bay sands skypark.",,,
,,Interesting,5,,"Can see the sky view of Singapore and islands around it, but it should be a sunny day. One round consists of 30 to 35 minutes",,,
,,wonderful experience,5,,"On 8th june 2016 we reached de flyer at 10 am at that time rain started and managment told to wait for one hour,do u know one hour waiting looks like four hour in between we visted souviner shop and my favourite 7/11 joint ,rain stoped around 10.30 am and our turn was 6th, riding it was grt and then slowly it gained hight and we all four{me mywife friend and his wife enjoyed a lot,sight seen from above looks ammazing",,,
,,Sky high!,4,,"What a fun activity to do while in Singapore. I recommend you go in the evening, when the city below looks like the sky above-it sparkles! Fun to walk around in the ""capsule room"" that goes all the way around. A very smooth ride and constant photo opportunities.",,,
,,Best to visit at night,3,,"in my opinion, this is best to visit at night when all the lights are on. Although some of you may want to see it while there's still light. You can walk to the flyer from Marina Square or from Marina Bay Sands. Singapore however have other beautiful places to see and I'd go to others first. If you have time and extra money to spend, you can try this but it's not really a must see here.",,,
,,Amazing views in a 40 min ride,4,,"Well located and with a very attactive set up, offers grat views of the bay area on a 40 min ride at slow motion. Do not miss this one if you are in Singapore.",,,
,,Great views night and day,4,,Excellent views of Singapore. Easy access and parking. Surrounded by restaurants and near the Esplanade,,,
,,Bird eye view of Singapore,5,,"We went there in night around 9 pm...
Its nice to be there..... the flyer take 32 minutes to rotate one circle... the view from the above is awesome...its not so thrilling... but if in Singapore.. one can go....one can walk from Marina Bay area to this flyer....its well connected to MRT..",,,
,,Okay,3,,Not much different to the London Eye. The information of the cultural backgrounds of the Singaporeans was a nice touch.,,,
,,Offers great views of Singapore,5,,A clear day provided great viewing and assume by visiting on a weekday meant we had the car to ourselves.,,,
,,Bird's Eye view,5,,"This is a 30 minute ride for 33 sgd for one Adult giving a Bird's eye view of Singapore.
We visited during afternoon and hence could not experience the brighter view of the city/Sea etc. Definitely worth the money and the time. There are AC Capsules which accommodate about 4 to 5 people in each of them and it moves real slow for visitors to capture as much view as possible.
People with vertigo(height fear) can also board(my opinion--decide at your discretion) it only to discover the serene view.
Don't miss it, After all it is SG Eye ;)",,,
,,Last Ride in Thunderstorm,4,,This was our third time on the Singapore Flyer. We had family with us that hadn't experienced the ride. Unfortunately the weather had packed in after we purchased tickets so we had an exciting ride in the centre of a thunderstorm with lightning flashing around us. The views were obviously restricted but interesting seeing the waterfalls coming off the highways below. The ride was closed to other passengers before our ride was finished so there were no que's which was a first for us. Highly recommended ride but chose the weather wisely if you want to enjoy the views.,,,
,,Nice view but can skip,4,,It was nice but not worth the S$30 for 30 minute ride. I would not do again. Go to the top of a large building and get the same view.,,,
,,2nd Trip on the Flyer,5,,"Delay getting our tickets. Not sure what the problem was, but took quite a while with the line getting longer. Once on the Flyer it is beautiful. The changing Singapore Skyline looks wonderful. Saw an eagle circling and then diving into the river and catching a fish. Will go again.",,,
,,Superb View,5,,Just Superb It takes 30 mins to complete one entire round and its worth it. You can enjoy the beautiful 360 degree view of the downtown Singapore city. Waiting Time is hardly 10 mins. MUST VISIT,,,
,,Best view of the city!,5,,"If you're not afraid of heights and looking to get a good view of the whole city, Singapore flyer is a must try. It lasts for a couple of minutes and stops for a while at the very top. It's safe and apparently the tallest ferris wheel in Asia.",,,
,,Great view and car to ourselves,5,,"I visited on a weekday morning with 3 children and we completely enjoyed our experience. The small museum ahead of the ride was well done. We had a car to ourselves so we had plenty of room to spread out, enjoy the views and take some great photos during the 30 min ride. We did get a modest discount on admissions by showing our Singapore Airlines ticket stub.",,,
,,Suitable as an evening activity,4,,"Though views in the morning are as good and awe-striking; but if you want a cherry on the cake, go after it's dark. The cityscape of Singapore at night (from the flyer!) is beyond any words!",,,
,,"Not a Must, Can give a try",3,,"Flyer provides the view of singapore from highest point. It movers very slow and you dont even know its moving. Ride was intersting for the first few mins, but later it was boring. We did not try the dinner table available in the flyer, so cannot comment on it. This ride is not a must, but you can give a try if time and money permits.",,,
,,A wonderful way to see the city.,5,,My husband and i went on a quite week night. We didn't wait long in line at all. The over all trip around took approx half an hour. It stopped at the top and we got an amazing view of the city with plenty of picture opportunities. Its a Singapore must!,,,
,,Breathtaking Views..Definitely must visit,5,,"Singapore Flyer offers breathtaking views of Singapore as the Ferris wheel slowly oscillates from bottom up. When it's at its pinnacle, take plenty of photos as the views are truly amazing. Panaromic views of Singapore from different angles of the cabin. As for the faint hearted there are seats to sit on if a bit terrified. Definitely worth a visit.",,,
,,Good views of Singapore,3,,Entry and exit like trying to navigate a rabbit warren over several levels. Duration is just about right. Great views.,,,
,,Lovely!,5,,"We visited Singapore Flyer during our honeymoon.
We went on a Monday, which i believe was a good time as it could get more crowded during weekends. The place was empty around the afternoon time. We went for the standard cabin and got one by ourselves.

What can I say about the views, breathtaking I guess?!

You can see most of the attractions by the bay from the cabin, and the way it spins is so cool, my husband made me notice that the cabin spinned 360 degrees while we were in it.

The cabin was super clean, so photos taken from there were amazing (no dirty glass if you know what i mean).

After leaving the flyer we had a short 10 min walk to the marina bay sands shopping mall.",,,
,,Flyer,5,,Well worth the money. Great Views. We were lucky enough to be there at dusk so saw the city in daylight and early evening with all the lights. Would definitely go again.,,,
,,Beautiful experience,5,,"A must do if you are visiting Singapore. Ensure to do it at night to ensure the beatiful city lights. Very well organized. Buy the tickets and walk your way into the floor to enter the flyer. They have staff who will guide your way to the capsule.

The flyer moves very slow, if you are scared of heights you can just sit in the capsule and wont feel it even moving.

If you are travelling alone be sure to get in with some good bunch of people. I went in with a bunch of tourists who screamed jumped and created chaos inside.",,,
,,view!,5,,"fantastic view and takes quite a while to go fully around so was pleased to just relax and enjoy the views. unfortunately rained while we were going around, but cleared up for some of it.",,,
,,"""a view of Singapore from the top""",4,,"i do not like heights, i feel nauseated looking down from above, so i had the apprehension in taking this ride, however since all my group mates dared me, i did. the ride fare is reasonable, the waiting time to ride is fast, the staff are friendly.
upon stepping in the car, they call it car with a different theme depending on your request because some cars could serve meals or drinks, but we got the car with the capacity of 15.
the car moved so slowly that before you will notice you are at the top, i did not feel bad. they view is fantastic so you have to be ready with your camera. from there you can review some of the sites in Singapore that you have visited.
you can move around, jump or do what you want and the car will not jerk or sway.
it is a relaxing ride one must experience, after all this is the biggest fairyswheel as they say.",,,
,,"Worth the time and money, at least to me",5,,"Sure, we all see Singapore from the air while flying in. But the Flyer is a way to extend that feeling and focus on the many sights within Singapore. The only downside is you're herded into a capsule and depending on how lucky you are, you may be with 20 nice, quiet people or some loud, obnoxious tourist trash. It's just the luck of the draw. One small tip: The herd will push forward to get a seat in the center of the capsule. Let 'em, because the best views come from standing on the outer edges. It doesn't feel too high or dangerous; the capsule moves slowly and has lots of railings. As always, try to go off-peak when the crowds are thinner.",,,
,,Great views & Well worthwhile on a clear day!,4,,"Always worthwhile for travelers that have not been to Singapore recently, offers great views over the city, Marina Bay & the Harbour. To see the most in a short time in Singapore suggest the 'Hop On Hop Off Bus' which is great value for money & covers the main sites around Singapore.",,,
,,Stunning,5,,I had a quiet chuckle at the London Eye being transported to Singapore! Wonderful views from the air-conditioned pods. I would recommend this tourist attraction unreservedly.,,,
,,Good view,4,,Good experience for a full view of Singapore.Costly but worth a ride if u can spare extra bucks.View is the only achievement,,,
,,Bird's eye view of Singapore from Flyer,5,,Life time experience to get the view of Singapur City from the Flyer. You need to ride twice - once in the day time for the panoramic view and once after the sun goes down and lights come out.,,,
,,What a view & experience !!,5,,"While on our City tour we bought tickets for the Singapore Flyer and the Bum boat ride on the Marina Bay. I have never had a similar experience before. Hence when I boarded the flyer I assumed the experience will be similar to watching the Cityscape from any other multi-storied building. However, I was wrong. The Flyer takes you for a 30-40 minute ride at a very slow pace. You are to view the Marina Bay, F1 track, the Financial Districts and the Surrounding Area. It is an amazing place to soak the view and to take lots of photographs. The Capsules are made up Sea through Reinforced Material. It is very steady and hence very safe.",,,
,,unique,3,,"It nice worth going and enjoying there , i had a great moment, to capture complete view of singapor itz good . Itz only wort for photography purpose.",,,
,,Interesting for a one off visit.,3,,Went to the flyer with family members and found it moderately interesting. Yes you Do get great views of Singapore but these can be seen from many other places in Singapore for much less price. A 'just OK' attraction.,,,
,,Flying without wings,5,,"We arrived early in the morning for this unique experience in order to avoid the crowds.Walking into the carriage was no trouble although I had twinges in my feet as I am normally scared of heights.I thought I can do this.
I did....it was worth it....I had been to Singapore many times before but to see it from this angle was a whole new experience.
Great photo opportunities .
Picking out the land markx was fun.
Next time it would be great to have dinner on the eye at night and see the lights of the fascinating city.
A donot miss experience.",,,
,,Coupled,5,,"Great views from this fantastic wheel. Even tho I get scared of heights after the initial fear it did pass as you could not feel the movement, and if just looking out not down I was not scared. Cars are very spacious so plenty of room to move around and sit in the middle if needs be.",,,
,,Great views of skyline,5,,"We have done the Eye in London, and the new one in Vegas, and this was equal in experience. The price was around $30SD, which was fair. The air conditioning was really nice, and given how hot and humid it was, it made for a nice break in the day.

If you're into Formula 1, it's cool to see so much of the track and pits. We also were able to walk across the bridge to the Gardens By The Bay, saving a few bucks on a cab.

Our only regret is we did it before we bought our hop on hop off tickets, which would have given us a discount. Also, there is a food court there open in the evenings. We tried the satay place, and three of us are for around $25SD.",,,
,,Skyhigh...worth a ride when in Singapore.,5,,"Excellent views over the CBD, Marina Bay, Gardens By the Bay, urban areas and ships at anchor offshore.

This was my second visit to the Singapore Flyer, went today around 10am - there was no queue - purchased my ticket and was onboard a few minutes later. I was lucky to have a capsule to myself making it easier to see from all points.

I think I was lucky as a tour group arrived a few minutes later which would have extended the wait time.

The ride takes about 30 minutes...views are good as you rotate - look down upon pit lane and then starting line of the Singapore F1 track, over to Gardens By the Bay and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and other locations mentioned above.

The view at the top of the rotation is great - next time I will visit at night to see the city lights.

Recommend this attraction....it's a revolution!",,,
,,Great Views,5,,We took this 'ride' and saw the sites of the beautiful city. It appears to go very slowly however it allows you to snap plenty of pictures and enjoy the view,,,
,,"Location looks good on paper, but accessibility is less than ideal.",3,,"You need to walk to get here, and whether you like that or not depends on the weather conditions, and whether you appreciate a 5 minute walk from Marina Square.

The place is largely empty, due to accessibility and the ride is the the only attraction.

The ride itself is nice and peaceful, at a good pace where you get your money's worth by having ample time to enjoy the view. I've seen couples just use that time to make out in one of the cars but that's their choice.

Apart from that, that's about it.",,,
,,Great views and experience,5,,"The Flyer has different packages for different budgets. All in all still expensive but the views are breathtaking and surprisingly different as people would usually climb up the Marina Bay Sands. The Flyer is very much recommendable, you have 360 degree views and you won't feel the flyer's motion at all.
Been there daytime, nighttime will be great as well I bet.",,,
,,Nice View of The City,4,,"1. Very beautiful view of the city from the top of the flyer.
2. The flyer moves at a slow pace that you will have enough time to take photo and admire the scenic view of the city.
3. Very spacious capsule and you can move around to have different view.",,,
,,Sunset,5,,Every visitor should do this Time your visit between 7 and 730pm to watch the sun go down and the city light up. And hopefully with a clear sky so you can see Indonesia and Malaysia.,,,
,,Against Fear of height,4,,"Awesome. For someone who is scared of height, I would say it was a great experience either day or night ride. The view was spectacular.",,,
,,Great View,5,,30 minute ride. Air conditioned cars. You can get champagne service and throw parties in n the cars ..for a price of course. Basic ride is $30 SD,,,
,,Not the most interesting,3,,"The view is decent on a clear day but a waste of time otherwise. This is also not for the claustrophobic, as you'll be stuck in a capsule for a good 20 odd minutes. I'd recommend taking a walk around the bay instead.",,,
,,good different experience,5,,it is good experience from where you can explore whole of singapore peacefully at a glance. it takes nearly 45 min for one round but in a group really enjoyable as sitting is also very comfortable and you acn watch ilumintaed singapore beautifully.,,,
,,Great 360 degree view,5,,"In here you able to experience unlimited 360 great view of Singapore which allow to be at the top view, clean cabin.",,,
,,Normal experience with costly entry,3,,The experience one bags doesn't fit the cost of entry. The location and everything is good yet that lacked satisfaction.,,,
,,Better than the London eye - and cheaper and bigger!!,4,,"Good views of the harbour and downtown Singapore. Air conditioned pods. Get there before ten to avoid queues. Staff helpful, price reasonable.",,,
,,Singapore Eye - Up in the Sky,4,,"To appreciate Singapore more, a view of the city from the Eye is a must. There is a discounted charge for senior citizens so take your passport with you. Before you enter they take a photo of you which you can buy if you wish after the ride. Unfortunately for me I was just told wait here we are taking a photo without an explanation at all, only to be shown the photo at the end of the ride and I didn't like the photo because I hadn't posed well.",,,
,,"Great views, clean and well operated.",4,,"Great spot, in a good night you get great views over the harbour, gardens by the bay and marina bay sands.",,,
,,Awesome view,5,,"A must do at Marina Bay, nice slow trip at about 30mins, great views and fully aircon which is a blessing. Reasonably priced as well",,,
,,A brilliant view of singapore,4,,"If you're in Singapore , you must include one of these two in your itinerary. Singapore flyer or the boat cruise at Merlion Park. The latter is reviewed in detail ( check out my reviews ). The flyer is a giant wheel ride of approximately 30 minutes. It rotates ever so slowly that you can have a good look at Singapore's waterline ( the dock/bay area ) and also the beautiful city itself. While you're in the ride, you'll find the water below quite pleasing to the eye. One coupe can roughly house 16-18 people at once though the seating arrangement is not enough for all but the ride itself is enjoyable. You can get the tickets arranged on the spot or have your travel agent do it for you .Have fun !",,,
,,Pay the extra for the cocktail/champagne flight!,5,,"I gave my fianc茅 a champagne flight for her birthday. We waited in a vip lounge before hand and then when our cabin was ready we were ushered past the long waiting line for general admission. With only 2 others in our group we enjoyed the view almost to ourselves, much better than sharing a space with up to 22 others!!",,,
,,Breathtaking experience,4,,The view whike inside the Singapore flyer is breathtaking! One can enjoy the magnificent sunset view. So better go there at dusk for an unforgettable experience.,,,
,,Nice place walk around,5,,"Even not purpose to take flyer, only for walking purpose also great place to take a walk. It was great place to see marina bay sands from the opposite side as well. It was close to my hotel and found here by chance. Ppl who is working here as security was very friendly and hospitable to guide me the facility information as well.",,,
,,Amazing View,5,,"If you want to see the entire skyline of Singapore and the neighboring islands, then Singapore Flyer is is a must visit attraction. The entire trip takes 30 minutes. The view from the top is breathtaking. The speed of the flyer is so slow that you will not even realize that the flyer is actually moving. Only when you look at the other side of the flyer , then you will feel the movement of the cabins.
You can simply sit back relax and watch the view of Gardens By the Bay , Marina Bay Sands, Helix Bridge, CBD .",,,
,,A Must Visit Attraction,5,,"It has an awesome experience for everyone. The inside is comforting and well air-conditioned. What I have to say is that for you Instagrammers, This ride is perfect for you to capture the wildest views of Singapore. The accessibility is quite easy, I would suggest you use the MRT for faster and fun ride. For detailed information of the MRT lines, the closest MRT station to the Singapore Flyer is the Promenade station. It can be accessed through the Downtown line or the Circle Line. The station code is DT15 or CC4.",,,
,,Great view on marina,5,,My girlfriend and I went in the week in early afternoon and managed to get a whole pod to ourselves. The views of the marina and harbour were incredible. Definitely a must-see during even the shortest trip to Singapore.,,,
,,Our ride on the Singapore Flyer,5,,My friend and I were on a stopover in Singapore and on our last day decided to go on the Singapore Flyer. We thought it was amazing. From the top you can see Malaysia and Indonesia and also have a marvellous view of Singapore itself. It was a really hot day and the cabin s on the flyer are air conditioned. If ever in Singapore we will repeat the experience.,,,
,,Wonderful,5,,So nice view from the sky.. i like it and i wish that i will back there again.. if you go to singapore you must go to the flyer ;),,,
,,A Different experience being on the TOP of the world.,5,,"Singapore Flyer is a good experience for all ages. Many fear height but you hardly feel it moving.
It is a 30 min experience, You may feel uneasy for 2-3 min if you have height issues, but after that just enjoy the scenery.
Singapore from TOP is worth viewing.
I understand Kris Flyer members have some discount on tickets.

After this you can walk to Marina Bay for the laser show.",,,
,,Spectacular view,5,,"The wheel takes you up 150+ meters and the cabin is air conditioned with seating, so it was a smooth 30+ minute ride. I would advise to go just before sunset.",,,
,,360deg view of Singapore slow moving capsule.,5,,"For a good all round360deg view of Singapore, try the flyer, we preferrred doing this on a bringht sunny day so that we can see the structures and sea. Some would prefer the night lights. One circle takes about 30 minutes and you get all the time to take lotsa pics of yourself, with the sea, buildings, Marina bay sands, everything. Worth the money.",,,
,,View from the flyer is awesome.,5,,Just try the Singapore flyer to witness amazing views of the bay area and Singapore skyline. On the expensive side but worth it. While you are here don't forget to try the amphibians ride which takes you to land marks in the city and ends with a dip in the bay. This is very entertaining as you can see both merlions which protect Singapore and you can notice that one is turned towards the airport in order to protect and look over the main revenue generator for Singapore,,,
,,Good place to see singapore in slow motion,4,,Great place to see the beautiful building of singapore . Singapore flyer is the worlds tallest flyer as we speak. Must visit if you have $50 sing dollors.,,,
,,All round birds eye view of Singapore,5,,Gives you a city perspective from various angles and from the sky . Better to do this during dusk or twilight especially when the building lights are on. It gives one an actual aerial tour of the city and at a relaxed pace as well.Well Worth the visit.,,,
,,A trip to remember,4,,"We went on the flyer on a clear day, avoid if there is low cloud or rain forecast. We were lucky to have a capsule to ourselves. The full rotation takes about 30mins. The views were spectacular the city to one side & the straits to the other. We used the views to work out where else we were going to visit. A good view of parts of the F1 circuit. The nearest MRT station is Promenade then 5 mins walk to flyer. Food & drinks are available at a reasonable price on the 1st floor. Don't forget to buy your tickets on the 1st floor before proceeding to the entrance on the 2nd floor. All in all a great attraction well worth the money & one not to miss during your visit.",,,
,,Panoramic view,4,,"If you want to see Singapore on top, Singapore flyer is great! The Panoramic view is awesome. There is tourist guide map from the airport where you can get a10%discount coupon for this ride.",,,
,,Unique Experience,4,,You get fabulous views of the city. You can enjoy the scenery safely inside the capsule and take pictures from different parts of Singapore.,,,
,,Great way to view the city,5,,"A little expensive @ $33 each for 40 minutes, but a really great way to view Singapore CBD & bay gardens. There are three ticket offices but not all are open all the time so it can be confusing for first timers to find your way in.",,,
,,Smooth ride,4,,"The Singapore flyer was a very smooth and comfortable experience. There were no long queues and the support staff was efficient and helpful. The view from the top, as expected, was awesome. 40 minutes of sight seeing and photo clicking. An experience worth the money.",,,
,,Spectacular view,5,,"A great way to see Marina Bay and more, having stayed in Singapore nearly two weeks we thought we should go and see the Singapore Flyer, luckily we were able to get a pod on our own, the staff are very accommodating.

The views are simply stunning, this is a must, you get breathtaking views of Gardens by the bay, and Marina Bay Sands, I thoroughly recommend it.",,,
,,I dont like heights but did the flyer.,5,,Was a great experience. The flyer doesn't rock or creak and we were able to sit in the middle and look at the night lights. I would def recommend a ride.,,,
,,Worth visiting in the morning hours after breakfast,5,,"Nice experience . Panoramic view of Singapore city . Worth each dollar While buying tickets try to get a combo for flyer and river cruise , It saves your money Worth taking 6 photos captured by picture air team .",,,
,,Loved the ride,5,,"We took this ride around 6pm just before sunset. It was a great time to take the ride since the evening/night crowd hadn't started pouring in. Our group of five had one cabin to ourselves and there were no queues either. This ride goes higher than the London eye but the views are vastly different. You can really see how the city has been built up, fully using all it's land resources cleverly. The hop on hop off tour has a stop right at the base. There are a few food and snack options in the building that are quite good. This ride was included in the Singapore Explorer Passes that we had purchased from Singapore Airlines before departure to Singapore making the whole experience completely VFM",,,
,,Very good experience of flyer,4,,If you have never been to big Giant wheel you should go. It is not scary at all. Some people are scared of height & motion. You do not feel at all and can have good view.,,,
,,Wonderful views.,4,,"The views are spectacular. It's clean and well maintained. It wasn't very busy when we were there. A photo is taken before you embark, nice touch. The whole thing is overpriced.",,,
,,Great Views!,5,,"Good value for money and great views of Singapore, a must if you have time in Singapore. Would recommend to go in the morning to save waiting times.",,,
,,"Great views, worth conquering your fear of heights",5,,"Open both night and day, we chose early morning to best fit our schedule and were not disappointed! We were lucky it was a clear day and we could see for miles, the night lights would be great too if you chose that time. The air conditioned gondolas made the half hour circuit very comfortable, not so our fellow travellers who ignored the 'be considerate of other travellers' sign and shouted at each other constantly and pushed in front at every viewing spot. The staff were helpful and constantly checked on the gondolas for cleanliness. It is a great engineering feat, well worth a ride!",,,
,,Giant Wheel in Slow Motion,4,,"Wanted to experience The Flyer after having experienced London Eye and Las Vegas Wheels. Gives 360 degree view of Singapore. Has unique dining option, off course comes with a price.",,,
,,Magnificent views,4,,"A sure shot and a must do for any traveller to Singapore. A technical wonder - this gigantic Ferris wheel houses 28 cylinders which can each transport 28 passengers in each of them - which means 784 people in every revolution. 28 of course being a lucky Feng-Shui number. Rotating clockwise it gives a clear view of the F1 pit-stop building, the Gardens By the Bay, the CBD, and then even of Malaysia on a clear day. The movement of the wheel is so slow one doesn't even feel it moving!! Fantastic! This one is even bigger than the london eye! Must visit!",,,
,,romantic,5,,"This was just a cool experience, and I was fortunate enough to have money on me at the time to check it out. I shared my cart with an Ozzy girl I met from my hostel and 3 Japanese business men conducting work/pleasure together. Classy place to hang out.",,,
,,Very good to have a Bird's Eye View of Singapore,5,,Very good experience to have a Bird's Eye View of Singapore. Excited to reach and flawless after the experience.,,,
,,Best Singapore View,5,,It was truly an amazing experience...Loved every moment of it... One of the best way to view whole of singapore,,,
,,amazing views of Singapore,5,,the Singapore Flyer was a 30min round trip where you can take lots of pictures and see Singapore from high above,,,
,,Rise high,5,,Awesome view and awesome experience. Can see whole Singapore within the 30 mins ride. Slow motion of the flyer keeps it comfortable even for the hight fearing people.,,,
,,Not worth the money,3,,"No value for money (30 SGD per person). Ok, it is nice view but that's it. You can get better pictures elsewhere. Ride takes about 30 min and that is it. I would not go there again. Nothing specila Too pricey.",,,
,,Worth it!,4,,I thought I would get bored with the 30-minute ride on this giant ferris wheel but NO. It was an excellent way to see a panoramic view of Singapore. Try to go when there is less crowd and ask for a carriage that is empty for yourselves so you can walk around inside and take good shots. I enjoyed it!,,,
,,Not worth the money,3,,"No value for money (30 SGD per person). Ok it is a nice view but that is all it is. I would not go again,and I think you can definitely get better pictures elsewhere. Ride is 30 min long. Really nothing special.",,,
,,Great view from the Flyer !,5,,"Had an opportunity to ride the Singapore Flyer with my boys, my brother and sis-in-law and we got the whole cabin to ourselves ! 6 of us !
It can accommodate up to 23 pax. The whole ride took about 30 minutes and the view was amazing ! You can take as many photos as you wish as the ride is slow and comfortable.",,,
,,A Bird's eyeview of Singapore,5,,"If you have little time to spare in sightseeing, this is a must to do especially in the evening when all the lights are on from everywhere your sight can reach. The line is fast and the carts are huge that the kids with us can run around. Great photo op venue",,,
,,"Great views, make sure the weather is good, and book ahead if possible",5,,"This wheel must be one of the largest in the world, and so of course you get great views of all sides of Singapore, especially near the top of the ride. Of course, time your visit for when the weather is good. The ride is slow enough for you to take good photos but short enough not to get boring. There can be a queue at busy times, booking online may help you avoid some (but not all) of the queue.",,,
,,Beautiful at night,4,,"I have been on the flyer a few years ago during the day, I think it's a lot better at night. This time we had the Singapore Slings so we we're in the Moet Capsule. Drink was mostly ice, definitely not worth the extra money!",,,
,,Must Ride at least once,5,,"Singapore Flyer is an awesome experience. The view from each angle of flight is amazing. There is no height sickness or fear involved. So just jump in even if you are faint at heart. I vouch, you will love the experience. 40 minutes ride will feel like ended soon.",,,
,,Spectacular Views,5,,This is the world's largest observation wheel which moves slowly enough to take great photos of the fantastic harbor/river/buildings lit up at night.,,,
,,Great .. amwzing,5,,amazing ride .. view from flyer is awesome.. you must visit once in a life .. for singapore flyer you must vist at night because night view is better then day view,,,
,,Very good,4,,Must visit 6d movie and flight simulator in the flyer place Spa also very good in the place And 6d movie experience you gonna love that..,,,
,,a must visit,4,,"this attraction gives so much view of city from way up.. The ride is one of a kind, and you wont feel claustrophobic as the cabin is ample with wide windows providing you a panoramic view of the great city..its also easily accessible as its just a few blocks from Marina bay and is part of SIA hop on hop off stops..

a definite must have on your itinerary when visiting Singapore",,,
,,Fine,3,,"It is a good experience to have been up in Singapore flyer. View of the city was fine from up there, visiting day time should be fine too. Prepare enough time to enjoy the at this place for if the queue is empty then you are lucky but otherwise there'll be a long queue.",,,
,,Nice ride!,5,,Singapore Flyer is the biggest in the world! I took the ride in the evening and the views are simply spectacular!,,,
,,A great view over Singapore,5,,This attraction was included in our Stopover Holiday package so we decided to use it. We were expecting queues like the London Eye but there were no queues and only 4 of us in the compartment. It was a very enjoyable experience.,,,
,,Flying high,5,,"Excellent views of the city, highly recommend. Would suggest you buy your tickets online. Can use any time of the day . Staff friendly",,,
,,Loved It,5,,A great flyer. You can see the whole of Singapore from above. Located near Marina. Good opportunity to take photo. Organized. Heard that it is better at night. However we rode it at daytime and it was fun,,,
,,Nice view.,4,,Had free ticket via my F1 ticket package. View was nice... good overview of the track during practice.,,,
,,Amazing,5,,Amazing activity....especially at loved it at night... Anice city view and quite amazing experience. Good arrrangement,,,
,,Comfortable and picturesque!!!,5,,"Singapore from the flyer is a treat. Big comfortable cabins.... You will enjoy this ride not for thrill but only getting some good snaps and a lovely view of the bay, marina Bay Sands hotel and the very green Singapore.... Organised.... Tickets avble at the venue....",,,
,,Don't buy a ticket to the top,3,,You can go up to the top for free if you go t the restaurant. You can eat and drink or not. You will see as much as if you pay to go up. The area you really want to see you have to be a hotel guest to go there.,,,
,,Panoramic view of the city,5,,"Wonderful view of city and port from the top,the wheels spins gently so need to worry about nausea or any such thing.",,,
,,Nice,5,,Amazing place .good fun for childrens .try to go in day time..in night u just see only lightning..so better to go in day time,,,
,,Avoid it like the plague!,1,,"Though much is made of the Singapore Flyer (like the flyers or the eyes in other major cities), it is a big disappointment.

Once you are inside, you don't even feel that you are moving, unless you look at the other cabins. We almost went to sleep. It is that damn slow!

Tickets are expensive. Takes 30 minutes for a full round and the views that it offers are hardly something you can continue looking at for 30 minutes. Avoid it!",,,
,,Well organised birds eye view of Singapore and its neighbours !!,5,,"One of the highlights of our Family Holiday was being atop the 165 meter giant ferrous wheel called the Singapore Flyer !! My entire family enjoyed the same. The whole breath-taking ride took us exactly 30 minutes. We could see the whole of Singapore which covered beautiful sites like the F1 Track, the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, The Gardens by the Bay and more. The slow and yet safe observatory wheel was as smooth as silk as it went one complete round. The Wheel encourages a great ambiance - from a romantic dinner especially on Valentines day to a memorable family experience right through the year. The safety and security anywhere in Singapore is simply impeccable and very encouraging especially for new travelers to the Island nation. The various packages which includes either a meal on the ride, a champagne bottle or just memories with family & friends!!
So be there to experience life with a 360 degree view !!",,,
,,Fabulous views from above,5,,"The Singapore Flyer offers 360 degree views over Singapore and Gardens at the Bay. Entering the parking area does not prepare one for the charming garden, surrounded by a variety of restaurants.
Entrance to the Flyer is expensive but well worth it for the stunning views from above. The flyer also offers a good photo opportunities for aerial views of the bay and surrounding areas.",,,
,,Best views of Singapore!,5,,"Please DONOT miss out on this brilliant attraction in Singapore. It has gorgeous views on every side and the 30-minute ride is totally worth the time and the money. The Gardens by the bay on one end, the financial district on the other end and the Hotel Marina Bay Sands on the third, it will be the perfect place for clicking the Singapore skyline.",,,
,,Good view of SIngapore. Suggestible to go in Night,4,,"This was one of the best attractions in Singapore. You get a very good view of Singapore.Almost 10-20 people will be accomadated in one Flyer Car which is very spacious. Enjoyed the view of the Financial District of Singapore. The view will be more good when it reaches the highest point of the Flyer.
Charges are - 33 Singapore Dollar per person.",,,
,,Family trip,5,,"Singapore Flyer was included in our city tour ,first we thought it would be a waste of time but as we entered it we felt we would had lost if we skipped it .our flyer trip was over very soon as we just clicked a lot of photos we able to view the whole Singapore from it .",,,
,,Good view,5,,Great place to get a birds eye view of the city. We went during the day and althought the view was spectacular I think a dusk visit might have been better.,,,
,,One of the best ways to view Singapore,5,,"Loved the Singapore Flyer.
Only in Singapore for four days and this was one of the best ways we found to 'see' Singapore. The flyer takes about half an hour to complete the circle giving plenty of time for quality photos and video of the city and coast.
The hop-on-hop-off bus stops here so it is easy to get to. The Singapore Flyer site also has resturants (including a 'street food' market underneath) as well as other great experiences (3D ride and Flight Simulator).",,,
,,Extremely high,5,,The Singapore flyer is one of the largest Ferris wheels I have ever seen The gondolas are fully enclosed You are so high in the air the the buildings look small. You can almost see the top floor of the boat Buliding ( large Buliding that looks like a boat is lying across the roof).,,,
,,Great city view,3,,This is a great way to see the city sights however it is quite expensive for what you get. There is a free museum included in the ticket about the Singapore flyer however it does not really add much to the overall experience,,,
,,SG Flyer Ride,3,,"I'm a person with a fear of heights, but since it's my sons' first trip in SG i wanted him to experience The Flyer even if i find it scary... and a bit expensive (S$33) for only a short ride haha! ;) Yes, it's a nice slow-moving observation deck but if you are someone like me who loves to take photos, you will find the glass panel of the deck unfriendly coz it prevents you from taking clear pictures. Plus, before i knew it the ride was over in under 30mins hehe! Photography is always my primary concern when i go to places. So if you are only after taking pics and on a tight budget and would have to choose between this ride and the Sands SkyPark, i would suggest the latter. You can stay for a longer period, enjoy the great view while sipping a cup of coffee.. and most esp. take snapshots of SG's skyline and entrance ticket is a bit cheaper (S$23).. hehe! For me, best time to go up the park is in the afternoon. Great opportunity to catch the sunset... :)",,,
,,Super ride.,5,,I'm really glad to say I have visited to Singapore flyer on my first day of Singapore visit and it is awesome. Didn't wnt to get down from it .. The overlook towards marina bay sands and marina bay sands garden was amazing ..,,,
,,Panoramic views of the SG skyline,4,,"The view from the top is awesome, even though we visited during noon time. could not find time to visit during evenings. From Promenade MRT, it is a short walk. The Hop on hop off buses go directly at the entrance. Opted for the regular ticket as you can walk in any time.
Once inside you can walk around the capsule for taking photos.It was very spacious with around 10 more people with us. Even those who are afraid of heights can try this as the movement is very slow ( it takes 30 mts for each round) unlike a cable car ride.
Worth the money!!",,,
,,Spectacular,4,,Not being good at heights we did not actually take a ride on the Singapore Flyer but it is a spectacular and very popular now iconic attraction. It can be seen from anywhere around the marina and at night it is a blaze of colour,,,
,,Birds eye view,5,,We did this ride in the early afternoon and shared a car with two other people. The car takes half an hour to go around and you can see for miles. It would be good to do at sunset. At $33 each it might not be for everyone.,,,
,,bird`s eye,4,,"beautiful singapore is below you as you are getting up and up very scenic and joyful moments.it is the central hub for visitors aas main attraction merlion statue and marina bay sands near by, worth spending evening leisurely, you can go for river cruise after completeing flyer . they will drop at merlion.",,,
,,What an idea to present aerial view,5,,It's really an enchanting experience to go in the Flyer and have a 360* view of lovely Singapore. Hats off to the idea of this provided to the tourists. I wanted to go once again in the Flyer during night but couldn't make it..,,,
,,Good for views!,4,,You would love the views. Takes about an hour but time well spent. Kids love it. It can be closed at certain times.,,,
,,Average,2,,Just like any other flyer around the world. Heavily priced for just one round and since it often rains in Singapore you won't get to see much unless you wait out for the rain to stop.,,,
,,Great Experience!,5,,"This ride provides a nice view of the whole city, we found really interesting the view of the port. There is an amazing quantity of ships waiting there, we really liked it.",,,
,,Evening Scenery,4,,Wanna rides the Singapore flyer. My advise to travellers. Rides between 4-7.pm lt .You could see the sunset @6.45PM . The weather not so humid n the view is very clear. Try to visit on week days instead of week end. So guys ENJOYED,,,
,,Fun but long wait.,3,,"Had to queue quite long. Pricing is a bit steep even with discount voucher. View is fantastic though, cannot beat.",,,
,,SINGAPORE FROM THE SKY,5,,"The view of Singapore from the Flyer is nothing short of awesome and a must do activity if you are in singapore. The time taken to complete one round is about 30 mts , and also if you have deep pockets and a fastcar junkie you can also take a drive on the F1 street circuit in a FERRARI or LAMBORGINI or PORCHE for about $230.",,,
,,Good Experience,4,,"Enjoyed the one hour round ride that gave a great view of the city. With a night time experience, one gets to see the city in a different light! Worth a try!",,,
,,Beautiful view,4,,We were advised not to take a flyer ride.... as its little on the expensive side ... nevertheless we went ahead and took it ...and it was all worth it.... we went when city lights were up.... and it looked amazing from up there....the ride takes around 30 mins ... and some times they stop the flyer if it rains or during lightning... and tickets are not refundable ... so chk forecast before hand... go and enjoy,,,
,,Better than the London Eye !,5,,"My wife and I were delighted with the whole experience. The grounds surrounding the attraction were very interesting, not least being able to wander on to the Singapore Grand Prix circuit and take lots of photos of the pits, the drivers' enclosures, starting grid and much more !",,,
,,Excellent view....,5,,"It's a giant wheel with many cylindrical cabins attached. The wheel is continuously rotating at a very low speed, that you won't even feel it's moving/ rotating. Exhilarating views of Singapore city can be viewed all sides standing or sitting within the cab. Really excellent views. At night it's again a different charming view with lights all around. For a complete turn it takes exactly 30 minutes. You can book online tickets, you can buy physical tickets from the counters too. The economy trip costs you 30 Singapore Dollar (21 usd) per person per trip. The flight entrance and exit is on the 2nd level of the building. On exit and on 1st level there are many shops and food joints where you can buy mementos etc or have some food. You can also buy a costly ticket with food and drinks served within the cabin during the flight too. I Hope the price is double the normal one. Clenliness is the best aspect of Singapore and so with the flyer. For smokers, they have a designated open air smoking place on the left side just before you enter the building, while you are entering.",,,
,,See the city from up above,3,,"Pretty neat way to see the city from above. It's not the highest point to see around (I believe the Altitude Bar has that distinction) but nevertheless it's a sight to behold even when not on the Flyer itself. I suggest you buy tickets in advance from the tourist hub a day before (located on ground floor near the food shops) - so you can skip the crazy line that forms for general ticket sales. You'll thank me later. Then after you board the Flyer, muscle in so you can take your own selfies with the background of the MBS, the city, Gardens by the Bay, etc. The only thing bad about this ride are all the other people taking pictures of themselves like they're special ... they're not. 30 minutes to make a complete revolution.",,,
,,Incredible,5,,"My family and I opted for the Sky Dining experiences - four courses, two turns of the observation wheel and incredible views over Marina Bay.
The food was really good and we were particularly impressed with the fact that the main courses were brought in fresh and hot when the observation wheel had finished its first cycle.
We had lovely food with beautiful views over Singapore, and finished with (what else?) a Singapore Sling.",,,
,,Amazing experience and heart touching view of city Singapore,5,,We've visited 25 March 2016. It's was amazing experience of my life. Gorgeous view of city Singapore .it costs 33SGD per adult per round . It takes about 30 minutes to do one round. This is the first activity we did in Singapore on arrival. You can see stunning view of Marina Bay of Sands.,,,
,,See Singapore from the top,5,,"The Flyer is an amazing experience in the day and I'm sure it would be at night as you can see for miles. The Singapore city is very vertical and the buildings are shown in all their glory from way up there. Also the bay with all the waiting ships, the Gardens by the Bay and all their glorious colour come to life. A feast for the eyes. You feel perfectly safe as you walk around in the carousel that carries you at a very slow pace. The building of this ""Ferris Wheel"" is a true work of art.",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,"Well you can't go to Singapore and not do this attraction. I can't remember the price, but the views are great, and therefore worth it in my opinion.",,,
,,Awesome view 锟斤拷,5,,It's an amazing view to be on the top in this flyer the view from each height is amazingly beautiful from the top the whole Singapore is visible and few islands too.... the flyer is totally safe and one must prefer to visit in night although it is opened fr the entire day as per given timings..... one should not miss this... good luck,,,
,,Birds Eye View,5,,"Try not to miss an opportunity to visit this attraction,gives you such a view of the marine area. Well worth the money.",,,
,,Gets boring after sometime,3,,"Yes its one of the many attractions of Aingapore but it does get a little boring after 10 minutes and you could see the views that you get from any of the rooftop bars and restaurants of Singapore.
Infact so many of the building have a better view than the flyer and not to forget that this is a little too expensive as well",,,
,,A 360 degree view of Singapore!,5,,It was a great experience riding the Singapore flyer. You will have a 360 degree view of Singapore. It is easily accessible if you use the MRT or take a taxi. I recommend it to those who plan to visit Singapore.,,,
,,Best views of singapore skyline!,4,,"Best way to see the singapore sky line, especially night time.
The slow moving wheel is almost imperceptible in its movement.
There is also an option to dine in the carriage itself for an extra amount obviously!
Must be fun to do so in next visit.
One can also view across the ocean as it overlooks it and as well the the majestic Marina Bay sands building, in my opinion one of the best hotels one can get to stay!",,,
,,What a view from top above!!,5,,This is by far the most fascinating rides in Singapore. The tallest observation wheel in the shape of a capsule which can seat around 8 people at 1 time. It takes 30mins to do a full circle and you get to see beautiful views from above. This is a must do for all.,,,
,,Beautiful View,3,,Singapore flyer is awesome. Its estimated time is about half an hour and it is between land and sea.this was an excellent way to see some of the best views of the city. I would definitely recommend this,,,
,,One of the highest in the world!!,5,,"Definitely a ""must try once"" experience. It delivers breathtaking 360degree views of Singapore. We showed our boarding pass at the ticket booth prior to purchasing and received a discount :) There are lots of photo opportunities and the glass cabin is well ventilated with lots of room to move around. We had a look at the small fish pond garden at the bottom of the flyer which have seats for those who prefer not to ride.",,,
,,A Bird's Eye View of Singapore,5,,"Been to singapore several times and this is the First Time I rode the Singapore Flyer for a Bird's Eye View of the island/nation. It's a slow-moving capsule that affords a nice view of the landmarks of Singapore-the river, the Gardens by the Bay, etc. Since we rode during the daytime, the view was breathtaking from above.",,,
,,Quite Cool,4,,"It takes about 30 minutes to have one rotation. It's quite romantic if you go at around sunset. (But it will be very crowded) You can enjoy chill atmosphere and conversation with you partner. I prefer you to go as a couple instead of family as there's nothing much to do as a family. There's bench in the center if i recall it right, where you can just sit there and chill. I'd recommend it for people who like to take photos and appreciate ""view"", but if you are an active person who'd rather walk around, I wouldn't suggest this attraction much.",,,
,,Worth checking out!,4,,This view really allows you to get a good look at the whole city! We went late morning on the weekend so it was a bit crowded but line moves fast and most of the time you're in line you are waiting in aircon. Definitely worth checking out while in Singapore,,,
,,Amazing views,5,,It was great fun at Flyer. It gives you time to slowly see the spectacular view of Singapore City. Its cintinuously moves. Its a restaurant as well. Most important its not scary to kids even at top.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer - must visit,5,,"The first thing while across is WOW....its engineering marvel and is almost 160 m or so high, has capsules to stay and round about it. Observed to be such a fantastic and worth visiting place with family, though slightly costly nut worth of it.",,,
,,Lovely views,4,,"Another must do in Singapore. The views from the Flyer are simply superb. The ride is slow, and gives ample opportunity for photographs. However, the blue sunfilm on the doors and windows add a bluish tinge to the pictures. Nonetheless, a good experience. I was particularly to see a part of the Singapore Grand Prix race track at the bottom of the flyer.",,,
,,Great view of Singapore,5,,"This gives a great way of the bay, the many ships out in the port and nearly all of City of Singapore. Great view of Gardens by the Bay in the daytime. A must see on any Singapore visit!",,,
,,Exquisite!,5,,WOW! Too much beauty for a 45 minutes ride. Thank You Travel Delightfully for the advise of doing this attraction. Worth your time.,,,
,,Surreal and Unforgettable Experience!,5,,I conquered my fear of heights and rode the Singapore Flyer. It was a very comfortable ride and gives you a great great view of Singapore especially Marina Bay Sands! Highly recommended!,,,
,,Enjoy the scenery 165 meters above the city!,4,,"Singapore Flyer is a good option if you don't like still higher open air rooftop 1-Altitude bar. You can enjoy the scenery safely inside the capsule and take pictures from different parts of Singapore.
OK, it's a tourist trap and maybe a little pricey, but at least a unique experience.",,,
,,Amazing Place to visit in Singapore,5,,We visited here on 16th May and it was an awesome experience watching Singapore from top of the Flyer. A must visit place for everybody.,,,
,,Awesome,5,,"This is a must do activity in Singapore. The views are just breathtaking. If you are nervous about heights, don't be as it is very stable even with people moving around the capsule. It moves very slowly and offers no end of photo opportunities",,,
,,Night flight is the time,4,,A flight on the flyer at night gives a good view of the lights in the city and of the ships in the bay. A view of the light show in the gardens at night are spectacular if you get the timing right.,,,
,,Good experience,4,,"Bought the expensive ticket option, so was a good experience... else watching people go in the general queue was not such a good sight.",,,
,,Incredible view,5,,We rode on the flyer around dusk. The view was incredible and the city lights were very pretty from this height. It was a positive experience and we felt pice was appropriate for the ride. It's defiantly worth the effort!,,,
,,360 Degree view of the Singapore Skyline,4,,Great way to take in views of Marina Bay and the Singapore Skyline and Gardens by the Bay. Definitely a must do for anybody of all ages visiting Singapore.,,,
,,Most unique experience,5,,"Highest flyer in the world, Panasonic view of the city, island spotting, slow romantic ride, 40 minutes of pure bliss. Certainly must visit. Singapore trip is incomplete without this. Loved it totally!!",,,
,,Wow.,5,,A definite must. Obvious great views. Let's one admire the diverse architecture of the city---it's amazing.,,,
,,Nice view from top,3,,Singapore Flyer is a nice place but not up-to the mark. May be my expectations are very high seeing other places in Singapore. Nice view,,,
,,Awesome views,5,,"The views were great from the top. We went during the night and we even got to see the laser show at marina Bay Sands from the Flyer.

We opted to go for the regular ticketed price , not the cocktail price, nor vip price but we only had a couple of other people inside with us , so it wasn't crowded at all (at least at that time of the night)

It's definitely a must do in SG!",,,
,,UP ABOVE THE SKY SO HIGH,5,,Everything about Singapore has this magical aura about it especially the Singapore flyer ...the beauty the engineers have captured and thoughtfully designed flyers is simply a memorable spot of singapore.,,,
,,Makes for good photos,4,,"The view is good and the pace of the wheel's movement is quite comfortable. The average age of my group was 50, and nobody felt nauseous. There are buses and trains that will go to this place.",,,
,,birds eye view of singapore,4,,i went with 6 yr old son .in our cubicle there was one more family.it took 30 mts to have a full turn.its nice to see the whole of singapore from top.its an experience. could see gardens by bay.esplanade.river.merlion......lot more from top.,,,
,,Giant Ferris Wheel at SG,4,,I'm afraid of heights but when you ride at this flyer no worries at all. An amazing ride for a 360 degrees view of SG :) I just love to ride this again with my kids in the future.,,,
,,Nice experience!,5,,"Best way to see overall city attractions in one go! It moves very slowly and takes about close to an hour to complete one circle and through that time, most of the main places of the city can be seen and spotted easily. Looks extremely beautiful!",,,
,,Great relaxing view of city,4,,Great relaxing view of city. Can see almost everything with this ride. Worth a visit if in the area for tourists.,,,
,,Queued for ages and turned away due to weather,3,,Arghhhhhh I queued for ages win my 4 and 15 year old only to be turned away just as we were next to get on. Be aware that this attraction can suddenly close due to lightening risk. We were given a stamp to return anytime during the week. I'm inly here for another day and going to universal studios so now I'm not sure if I'll get on at all. I couldn't get a refund :-(,,,
,,Amazing experience must visit place,5,,"it takes 30 minutes to complete, you can see an amazing views of Singapore which includes Marina Bay, Sentosa island etc.",,,
,,Between land and sea,4,,Singapore flyer is awesome. Its estimated time is about half an hour and it is between land and sea and so we get to look at Singapore land from one end and sea from other end. Best time to visit flyer is around 6:30pm. So that you get chance to see both daylight and night view. It's worth one time visit.,,,
,,"Either night or day , best place to go",5,,You can see the entire city from the flyer. Each cube in the flyer is very spacious and clean . It takes an hour to complete the circle. you dont get scared of height .beautiful view of the city .,,,
,,Beautiful,4,,A great way to view Marina bay. Much of your sightseeing can be done on here. We were only in Singapore for a few hours and needed to fit in as much as possible. Also very close to Marina Bay sands and shopping areas.,,,
,,Beautiful View,5,,"This was an excellent way to see some of the best views of the city. I would definitely recommend this. I have yet to do the evening trip, but will do so on my next trip.",,,
,,Place to Review Singapore Skyline,5,,Singapore flyer is one attraction I suggest one should not miss. The evening twilight time is the best time to get into the flyer,,,
,,Amazing and mesmerising. Must do in Singapore,5,,"Awesome, a bit expensive but worth it. Ideal for senior citizens and kids. Get to see the whole of Singapore and enjoy its coastline.",,,
,,amazing experience,5,,You cannot leave Singapore without visiting this wonderful place We went in the morning and very few people therefore great peace and tranquility up ther Well worth the money Fabulous views over this wonderful city I w0uld imagine it would get very very hot from noon Amost enjoyable experience and a wonderful photo taken there well worth the money too,,,
,,Must see view of Singapore,5,,"We went at night which is what I would recommend, the view is spectacular. There was not a long queue despite being a holiday and we got a seat fairly quickly. I thought there was good control of the cars and people and no overcrowding allowed. The only negative for me was the price, which can be quite expensive for a family.",,,
,,Wonderful views,5,,Had initially planned to do this in the evening to see lights but decided against it due to intense lightening which we had in the evenings when we were there. We had been warned that they would stop the wheel due to this type of weather. Our first couple of days were hazy so we were delighted that our last day was a beautiful clear day. Views are amazing and we could see for quite a distance. It was interesting to see the number of ships waiting to come into port as well as all the modern iconic buildings and Gardens by the Bay,,,
,,Great views from the top!,4,,This is the equivalent to the London Eye and offers great 360 degree views from the top of Singapore's amazing skylines as well as the Bay area,,,
,,best place to view the city - go up in evenings,5,,"This is probably the best place to view the city. Go there in evening so that you can see the millions of lights of this city-country, which does not generate its own electricity but has plenty of it.",,,
,,Bird's eye view of Singapore,5,,"An icon of Singapore tourism. It is best to start your trip of Singapore with this attraction as you can observe the country from a bird's eye view and then relate to them when you explore them in the land. We did this! We went here first and wherever we went, we related it with the view from the flyer. It is a 30-minute ride and the wheel moves so slow that it is hard to notice that you are moving at all. So people with a fear of heights can also indulge without any worry.",,,
,,Great,4,,We went on Tuesday evening. So the lines were empty. Got to board immediately. Walking from promenade MRT. Went at sunset. Got to see the city during the daylight and also during the night lights. Beautiful it is. Takes about half hour.,,,
,,Just a flyer,3,,"a bit boring, since its rotate for a long time.. I went there with 3 years old kid, and he asked to go outside.. hehehe. The positive thing is we can see Singapore.",,,
,,Singapore flyer very good place,3,,very enjoying in this place. one ticket is valid for one person and one around in 30 minutes. and its not enough,,,
,,Not just a ferris wheel,5,,A must do in Singapore! Only 4 in the world - not just a Ferris wheel but an experience. Try and go right on sunset for the best views - timing it can be hard though.,,,
,,The breathtaking view from above,5,,"Every thing here is systematic. The ticket is for 33 dollars but totally worth it. You are taken up in an air conditioned glass capsule. Th flyer moves slowly and the view is simply amazing. You can see the whole of Singapore and even Malaysia. The ships, people trees look so small below. I enjoyed taking selfies and pics.",,,
,,pretty,5,,"not for those who dont like heights, or want to spend a long time walking around in the heat very humid",,,
,,Top of the World Experience,4,,"I was last on the Flyer about five years ago, but made myself do this again so that my youngest child could enjoy the experience. The whole process was very efficient. We got on within 1-2 minutes of queuing up. The staff were very careful and alert. The views are breathtaking and it was exhilarating to be so high up. My only advice is to think twice if you suffer from vertigo :)",,,
,,Very big flyer,5,,Its fun to be in flyer. Nice high u can take pics from a nice height. Its an half an hour ride with great experience. One should try it when ever you visit singapore.,,,
,,Just another flyer,4,,"Though this flyer is a huge one, it us just another flyer like other big cities. It is situated in the Marina Bay Sand area; it is easy to go there by any metro rail or by taxi. Fare is 33SND for ride.",,,
,,Good experience,5,,A very good experience for everyone and the flyer is moving a acceptable pace. Entrance tickets are on the high side. Our wheel are a little crowded so some views are blocked. Would be nice if staff can make sure the wheels are occupied with a good number of guests before keep putting people in.,,,
,,Best attraction to see singapore in 360 degree,4,,Best attraction to see singapore in 360 degree. Worth a visit.Little costly. Prefer to go in weekday otherwise it is very crowded. Even the views you will not be able to see properly and take photos.,,,
,,Great views,5,,The Singapore Flyer is a must when visiting Singapore. The views are amazing and it is a great place to take the whole family.,,,
,,best view,5,,"if the wine you brought with you, you can make the best marriage proposal. Almost all the city can be seen",,,
,,Amazing view!,5,,"A visit to the flyer is a must. It gives you an amazing view of Singapore. Try the flyer in the morning and the Skypark in the night. It looks beautiful at night when it is lit, but I guess the view is better at night!. Takes just over half hour to finish one roung",,,
,,Fantastic views!,4,,"Took a trip on the flyer after dark so we could see the skyline by night. We weren't disappointed in the slightest, the views of the city/marina bay sands complex and gardens by the bay were awesome.
$30 each with a 10% discount (voucher off a free map), not cheap for a family however nothing is in Singapore. Virtually no queue. The ride it's self takes about 30 min.
Another massive tick in the box!",,,
,,Fun ride,4,,"The flyer is air conditioned and goes full circle in about 30 mins. Max 14 people per capsule with great views. As with everything in Singapore, well done. Great for entire family",,,
,,"The best ""BIG WHEEL"" I have been on for views",5,,"When they say this is the largest flyer in Asia, you have to check - but once you have been on it, you can tell from the amazing panoramic views that that the statement is correct. Its the highest and gives some of the best views I have seen :)
If you want it with less people then go early, but of course you will them miss the lights in the Gardens etc",,,
,,A must in Singapore,5,,What a wonderful attraction! Breath taking views. Easily accessible from Marina Bay. Small restaurants at entrance. Can close if bad weather. Children will enjoy it.,,,
,,The best view of Singapore!,5,,"Okay, I'll start by admitting that we never made it up to the top of Marina Bay Sands. So, if you want to swim in the infinity pool which overlooks the city, that's probably a better option.

HOWEVER, for a (cheaper) and just as spectacular view of Singapore, the Singapore Flyer would be my choice. This is especially true if you're a family (once you're all locked inside the pod, even parents can relax and and enjoy the sights, as there isn't anywhere for people to run off to!). Plus, the view continues to change during the 30min rotation - starting with views of the harbour and Marina Bay, and then ending with views over the city.

For the romantics, also check out the dining option. Two rotations (i.e. one hour) with a sit-down four course meal!

And, after the flight, make your way to ground level to check out the Koi Pond. There are also great on-ground photo opportunities with Marina Bay in the background, or in front of the ""Singapore Flyer"" sign (tip for iPhone users, the panorama feature is handy!).",,,
,,Wonderful view of Singapore,4,,Best way to get a nice view of Singapore. It鈥檚 better to visit during night. It moves slow. The ride takes around 20-30 minutes,,,
,,Wonderful experience!,5,,"It's a giant wheel and will take you 30 minutes to complete whole ride.
If you like city lights, go for a visit by 6.30 so that you can enjoy half ride during day light and half during city lights.
One can also dine in one of the cage for which you can find more information on their official website to reserve your table for a romantic date.",,,
,,A amazing view,5,,"This is a premium attraction of singapore it gives a great view of the city and the surrounding area, specially the view of the river. If you have been to the 360 restora at the petronas tower at malaysia K.L then you may not like this else do go there to enjoy the view if you donot mind paying for the high entry fee... Do check the food trail for good chinese food",,,
,,Gorgeous!,5,,Panoramic view of Singapore! Very very beautiful. Worth every penny. I personally prefer to go at night when it's dark.,,,
,,Beautiful views,3,,"This is an expensive activity but the views are stunning. We had a half hour wait which was pretty good considering it was over New Year. Stepping on and off the capsule was a little frightening as the flyer doesn't actually stop. There was someone to assist, but unless you are sure-footed and quick this is a little daunting.",,,
,,A great experience!,5,,"We waited until it was dark to take a ride on the Singapore Flyer which is basically a large wheel, with pods - similar to the London Eye. We had seen lots of sights during the day, but Singapore is magical lit up at night. We were able to watch laser lights as we went round. It takes about 30 minutes.",,,
,,Just unlucky with the weather,4,,Quite expensive for the ride but that's Singapore I guess. We were unlucky with the weather during the day and when it was clearing the glasses where foggy so we didn't have a perfect view. One time is clearly enough.,,,
,,Go just after sunset.,4,,Choose a right time. I recommend after sunset time. You get beautiful view just before dark and then lights adds to the beauty.,,,
,,At night,4,,"We were waiting for the sun to go down to see how Singapore looks at night from the top. It was nice. But if you have been on similar rides like London Eye, etc it will not impress you that much as they all are more or less the same.",,,
,,Night time,5,,If you like to see it use night time it will be better. 35-49 min is ride not to be visited once again but good to have the view over SG.,,,
,,Birds eye view,4,,"Its a way to view Singapore's skyline at a glance. The capsules are clean and air conditioned, making it a comfortable ride. There are pictures and names of places of interest inside the capsules for you to spot them yourself.",,,
,,Bird's Eye View,5,,"Amazing views of the city and some tourist hot spots. We went up on our last day in Singapore and had good weather. The full rotation takes 30 minutes in an air conditioned capsule. There are various options if you want to splash out but we just opted for the basic entry. I should imagine the views at night are just as spectacular, especially if you time it right to coincide with the Super Tree Light show. A great way to end our trip.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"Going to Singapore Flyer is quite convenient as you can drop off at millennium station. I went there during the afternoon time around 2pm to 3pm,not much crowd. Around there got a fast food restaurant if you want a quite bite and a gift shop. I will recommend to go around 5pm+ to 6pm as you can able to see the sunset and you can take good photos with great views on the top.",,,
,,Must see in Singagpore,4,,"A great attraction in Singapore, not for people looking for a thrill ride but for someone looking to see over the city.",,,
,,Excellent,5,,A must must experience if one is visiting Singapore for the first time.an experience of a lifetime u would cherish.though expensive but a must try thing.one will never realise it's moving.such is the beauty of the flyer,,,
,,Good view of Singapore,5,,"Amazingly placed, you can really see beauty natural beauty of Singapore, must visit, luckily you will find Indian restaurant At bottom of Flyer.",,,
,,Fabulous view!,5,,Lovely experience. Accessible to wheelchair users and the accompanying persons gets free access. The staff are very helpful and nice.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"It's been many years I have been visiting Singapore but got chance to visit singapore flyer for the first time , it has great views of Singapore skyline , must visit once , and don't forget to take the camera with you",,,
,,Absolutely sensational experience.,5,,Whilst attractions of this nature are found around the globe the Singapore Flyer is located in such great surroundings with excellent views of Singapore as it slowly revolves. It really is something special. A must to enjoy in Singapore.,,,
,,The views are indcredible,5,,"Expensive ferris wheel at $33 per ticket but, worth it! The views are stunning and allows you to see all the great architecture in Singapore. Goes slowly and you are safe in a sealed capsule of glass. Loved it.",,,
,,Get a good view of the city,3,,"It was worth doing, but it is really about just seeing the view of the city. There is no information regarding sites and places provided.",,,
,,Nice view up above!,4,,"Must go on weekdays daytime, no people queue up before sunset. We all 4 persons occupied one big cabin. Great view up above. Tips: buy package ticket with other attractions much worth:)",,,
,,Must do in aingapore,5,,"The flyer is an iconic attraction in Singapore. As adults, it provides a great and unique view of the city and kids always love it (we've been three times and they love it every time).

Make sure the weather is good as it can limit to view if hazy or rainy. The night offers perhaps the best viewing with the skyline and lights.

The ride is quite long so be sure to take your children to the toilet ahead of time. Also note that weekends may result in a long queue so getting there at 6pm allows for a shorter queue time and night viewing of he city.",,,
,,Stunning at night Time,4,,A trip on the flyer at night shows off the Singapore skyline. Its just a bit cooler too. Windows needed a clean but the view was great.No waiting time,,,
,,Views of Singapore from a different perspective.,5,,This attraction is in the area of the Formula 1 track. It has shops and gardens underneath the flyer. The pace is slow so you have plenty of time to take in the variety of views offered and take loads of photographs. Very enjoyable.,,,
,,Above average city 'wheel',4,,Ideal to get your perspective of Singapore. Great views of the botanical gardens as well as the F1 track. Well organised and moves at a speed that is not rushed to allow you to take in the city. Pods are large and don't seem to get over crowded to allow everyone to move around during the ride,,,
,,A must visit,5,,Whilst not keen on heights we found this wheel absolutely fascinating with views in all directions and virtually no sense of movement. It's inside the F1 track above the pit lane. Well run efficient boarding and exit.,,,
,,A must-try experience in Singspore,5,,"Besides Skypark, Singapore flyer is one of the best option to view Marina Bay. You can opt for the regular flyer which costs 33 SG dollars but you have to share the view in the flyer with other people or you pay extra (69 SG dollars) to enjoy either cocktail or Mo毛t and Chandon on the flyer. Most chance is that you would end up having the flyer yourself. And I consider the 69 SG dollars as an option for those who want to propose your loved one. It is so romantic even it lasts for just half an hour.",,,
,,the great ride in singapore flyer,5,,The Singapore flyer was really a great ride because of its awesome height and size and unimaginable gigantic machine to let you fly into the best ride of your life. Thank you very much Singapore and to the Late Prime Minister His Excellency Lee Kuan Yew for bringing best to Singapore for the Singapore people and to the whole world. And the ride was great because it tells you the best of Singapore and so relaxing and very enjoyable ride. Keep on Singapore and Grow into the best to the whole world. God bless you Singpore!,,,
,,Must do!,5,,If simply visiting singapore this is a must do first thing to assist you to orientate your position within the city. Not cheap but very worthwhile,,,
,,What a view,5,,"This was the best experience we left it to the last day before we left Singapore, I was a bit worried about the height and been trapped inside for 30minutes but it was the most relaxed feeling and the sights of the city was amazing",,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Its the biggest one in the world. We had no queue, price was great, we were given our own cabin for the ride. Fantastic views.",,,
,,Things to do,4,,"We visited the flier as part of the hop on hop off bus tour you can do in Singapore. It may not be as good as the London Eye, but gives you a wonderful view of Singapore and its surrounds",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,If you cannot go to Marina Bay Sands Hotel then Singapore Flyer is the alternative way to see the stunning view of Singapore at the top. The view is spectacular and a must do for the family vacationers.,,,
,,Great way to see the city,5,,"It's very ell done, in a great location on Marina Bay. To make a day of it, go early, have lunch at the excellent hawker food stalls downstairs, then visit nearby Gardens by the Bay in the afternoon.",,,
,,The giant rotate wheel,4,,"Stay on top and enjoy the views of Singapore city, especially at the night time. You would realize how amazing the view from the sky angle.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,Singapore Flyer very beautiful place and a wonderfull view ... I am really enjoying in this place .. I recommend to visit .. 馃憤馃徎鉂わ笍,,,
,,Fun to see the city of Singapore from above.,5,,"Great experience to fly with this but it kinda expensive. everything in SIN is expensive. Great Time and Great Fun, Recommended.",,,
,,Even better second time round,5,,"This was my second go at the Singapore flyer and I think I enjoyed it even more this time round as last time there was a lot of construction going on. As a F1 tragic, I was taking lots of pictures last time, this time I just enjoyed the peace and quiet and of course the views. Not the cheapest thing in the world but definitely worth it.",,,
,,Up! Up! Up!,5,,"Not your typical ferris wheel ride, because you can have romantic dinner with wine while riding in the Singapore Flyer, but that means additional fee. We only had the regular ride and it is still amazing! You will see the Singapore and enjoy the horizon! They also have a museum that you will walk thru before you ride in the flyer and they also have a souvenir coin that you can buy, if you want.",,,
,,top view,4,,you can see all Singapore when the wheel on top. the space spacious enough for few people inside. its moving very slow and nice. for 1 round will spend around 30 minutes from we get inside. the view is very nice. a problem if you taking picture with phone. you need to find which spot have the good light.,,,
,,Singapore flyer like London Eye,4,,"Its situated at best place in he city. You can see anything in the city from here. Marlion bay , parks, marina bay sand park etc everything.",,,
,,Beautiful view,4,,We went in Evening.It is a slow moving ride which takes around 45 mins total for one ride and cost SGD33 .You can even see Super Tree Grove light Show across the bay from the Flyer and Marina bay fountain show. Such a Beautiful view of the city.Recommended for first time visitors.,,,
,,A must go for Tourist!,3,,"Took the Flyer for 2 times(day and night). Prefer a night view of it with the lights on at those skyline buildings. Plus, it's not heaty at night like when I went during day time. Definitely a must go for tourist!",,,
,,Fascinating look out!!,5,,if you are in Singapore you have to go with the Singapore Flyer. Go there in the early morning and you will have the chance to have an own cabine! It is an incredible view over Singapore and the harbour with the hundreds of ships waiting!!! Highly recommended!,,,
,,At last...,4,,"Been wanting to ride this flyer for some quite time but I always fail. At last! Now that I am back for vacation, this is the first amusement ride that I had 鈽猴笍 everything is just cool. Great experience to be at the ""top of the world""",,,
,,Wonderful!,5,,The Singapore Flyer attraction should definitely be on the short list of activities to experience in Singapore. Also recommend fitting in a meal (or at least a refreshing cold anchor beer!) at the traditional Hawker Center that is also a part of this attraction.,,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,"This is a great way to get great views of Singapore. For my liking, the one revolution was too short.",,,
,,Perspective overview of Singapore,5,,"The flyer is something I would never have done had it not been part of the SIA explorer pass.

But ""man oh man"" this was worth the effort and it is recommended for any visitor to this city/country.

The view is brilliant.

Only improvement could be if there was non-reflective glass in the carriages to allow for better photography.",,,
,,Iconic wheel,5,,"Round and round and up and up. See the beautiful city skyline as you gather inside one of the many capsules of this giant ferries wheel.
Get your camera ready to mark this moment. Upload to Facebook and Instagram to set the trend. Suitable b for people of all ages",,,
,,must try for best 360 deg view of singapore.,4,,"as duck tour guide claims that view of even parts of malaysia and indonesia is possible from the wheel, but unless some Singaporeans points out its very difficult for tourist to find it..visited at 11 am..slow ride, go on a clear day and it takes approx 30~40 mins for a ride..",,,
,,Biggest giant wheel,3,,It's nice. Biggest at the moment. Bigger than the London flyer. Views are amazing. Did it at evening with daylight. Got a good view of the city. A bit expensive though,,,
,,Nice,4,,"Nice attraction, we had been there at weekdays, but the queue still long enough, i can't imagine at weekend.. it recommended not just go to the flyer only, considered it has another attraction at this area, such as 4d, etc",,,
,,Good aerial view of the city,3,,It is a enjoyable one time experience. Also a nice place to celebrate special occasions as each capsule can accommodate almost 24 people,,,
,,Nice to have,3,,Singapore flyer was nice to have for us ... as with the case in all flyers you don't get the best pictures due to glass and light issues ... it was nice to have ride if you have time,,,
,,Nice day for two,5,,This place are ideal for spending in romantic meeting with someone. Around 20 mins if you are lucky and today not crowded you can spend together enjoying spectacular views of the wonderful city . Especially during sunset . It is even more beautiful.,,,
,,Great view,4,,We really enjoyed the view from the Flyer. I would recommend for this to be done during daylight hours and keep the likes of rooftops bars for nighttime views,,,
,,Fantastic view!! Safe an absolutely a must if you visit Singapore.,5,,You can see all the way until Indonesia and Malaysia. You get explanations in your own language. A very special experience! I loved it! The highest point is a true stunning view!,,,
,,expensive,3,,"if you have a bit of cash to spare, the flyer is for you. i did it once and wouldn't recommend it. there are many bars and rooftops where you can find the same view and enjoy a drink.",,,
,,Birds eye view,4,,"We wanted to see Singapore from a different perspective. For few bucks and costing 30 minutes, this did the job. Made us appreciate layout of the city. Recommended for first time visitors!",,,
,,A Top View,5,,Really enjoyed the Singapore Flyer. This is easily better than the London Eye. Would recommend it to all visitors to Singapore.,,,
,,"Great views, easy trip",4,,"great to get a sense of Singapore from the sky, its a little expensive but well worth it. The views are spectacular and it not a hugely long trip so can be done in a morning quite easily.",,,
,,Beautiful view of the city,5,,"Not many people visit there, so maybe you can have a private cab. Inside the cab there are two long chairs, you can sit down to look around or just walk around to take photos. Very beautiful view and you can look at Singapore from a different angle. The whole trip is around 30-40 mins.",,,
,,Great views,5,,Great views . We did a night trip and view were amazing . It took approx 40 min . Highly recommended . We found it also very relaxing after spending the day shopping in Singapore,,,
,,A must visit,5,,It is a must visit because it was ver enjoyable watching the city from the top. We really recommend it to see the beauty of Singapore,,,
,,Memorable ride,5,,this should be list on your tour to Singapore. Exploring the city from this ride was nice experience. Bit costly for me but it is worth at least once time in life..try it!,,,
,,A great way to see Singapore and escape the heat,5,,"This was pretty good. A great way to see Singapore at all different heights and a great way to escape the heat. Takes about half hour to go all the way around. Don't get stuck down stairs behind the ""group booking"" otherwise you will be waiting there for ages. Go around them and head straight in. Great for all ages with plenty of room to move around. As an immediate introduction to Singapore and where everything is, would definitely recommend this first up.",,,
,,Must see and do,5,,"We were lucky enough to be able to have this wonderful experience as part of our Singapore Stopover deal with Singapore Airlines. This is definite must if you have time in Singapore. I was so entranced by the scenery, I forgot to check my watch, to see how long it took, but I'm guessing about 30 - 40 minutes. The cars are roomy enough to allow several people to be able to see the wonderful view. It was a clear day for us, so the view was a long one. Recommended.",,,
,,Amazing view,5,,"Great views. Definitely visit in the morning for clear views. Usually a bit overcast in the arvo. Clean and a comfortable ride, considering I am terrified of heights.",,,
,,Expensive Way to Get a View of the City,3,,"There is no denying that the Singapore Flyer provides a great view of the city. However, be prepared to pay for it. If I could do it over again, I would do some research into some bars or restaurants that provide similar views.",,,
,,Once in life,5,,Just good experience for family vacation. I had an wonderful time with my family in this place.,,,
,,Worth Visiting,4,,"The panoramic views are really good, it rotates really slowly, so you can take time out to look over all of Singapore. The capsules hold several people, when we took the ride it was really quiet. There are some places eat at the place, car parks very big.

At night it lights up and gives a very nice backdrop from the Marina Bay",,,
,,Lovely View,4,,"Just what you would expect from a big wheel. Lovely views and a great way to see the city. Waiting time was minimal, less than ten minutes. There are also other attractions in the complex, restaurants, shops and a small garden area. well worth a visit.",,,
,,Enthralling Experience,5,,"Oh boy, do take an hour's time and relax in the Singapore flyer as it takes you up and you can soak in the view of the great city. we went in the afternoon and enjoyed the view from there! Just relax and of course click pics. Next time I would like to try a evening ride up the flyer.",,,
,,Amazing ride on a great eye,5,,A bit scared of heights but once inside the large pod I wasn't scared at all and thoroughly enjoyed the amazing views over the city and harbour.,,,
,,Fly high and learn to get over your phobia of height,5,,"The flight took about 30 minutes, it slowly move and you don't even realize you already at the top... I'm afraid of height but from this Singapore Flyer, When reach the top not feel it anymore.",,,
,,Relaxing ride,5,,"When I first saw pictures of the Singapore flyer, I thought I would never ride it, because I am petrified of heights. However when I got there and saw it in person, it had very sturdy, large, enclosed capsules for the riders and it went very slowly, taking a half hour for a full revolution. It was not scary at all, and the views were beautiful. I am so glad I did it.",,,
,,Great views,5,,Worth the effort to see. High above the city. $33 less discounts (check out the fish spa at same location),,,
,,Good view of the city,4,,"Very nice experience. Its approx half an hour ride. Once you are inside the flyer you wont realize it is moving - since the speed is very slow.
Try to board it in the late evening so that you enjoy day light view as well as night view.",,,
,,Memorable experience,5,,"This really gives you a bird's-eye, 360 degree view of the city! Its slow pace gives you plenty of time to see it all. Clean, airy pods. There's the usual souvenirs on sale at each end but well worth the effort.",,,
,,Not any different to any big wheel in any country u do it because you are there,4,,Went on the Singapore Flyer because I was in Singapore and trying to experience everything on offer. This is just a Big Wheel no different to all other big wheels giving the view of a city. If you are staying somewhere like Marina Bay Sands you will no doubt get the view anyway. If you are not staying in a room with a view go for it.,,,
,,Good one!,5,,It's a good place if you haven't seen any other city flyer. Please do visit for kids only.. Hardly any movement .. Takes a long time to complete n so adults might feel bored. The info at the entrance before the flyer is very good.,,,
,,A different experience,5,,"Wanted to try this ride for my teenage son , it looks like a huge giant wheel , small closed cabins with seats , very safe , slow ride , takes about more than 30 mins for one complete ride , little expensive , got to see breathtaking views of Singapore city , gardens by the bay and sea , a different experience .",,,
,,Always wanted to do this,5,,"We visited the flyer with friends and did the trip. The views from the wheel are breathtaking. Good trip, and well worth the money, ($33Sing) each.",,,
,,Amazing Views.,5,,"Went in the evening, beautiful views of Singapore City. We were lucky so see the Super Tree Show across the bay from the Flyer. Good attraction.",,,
,,This is a must when in Singapore.,5,,"Most cities have an EYE, but this is the best one I have ever travelled on. London is good but this is better. Its pods are bigger, more seating, you can even have a meal on one pod, it seems higher, and the views are spectacular. As a bonus, you look down on the Grand Prix pits and grid.",,,
,,The View is Nice,4,,This is one of the way to enjoy the view of Singapore. The ride is almost 30 mins and hence there is plenty of opportunity to take good pictures from the ride. Best time to take the ride is in the morning or after 3 pm when the sun is not so blazing hot. No point taking the ride if weather is gloomy. Won't be worth the price.,,,
,,Graceful and panoramic,4,,Great over view of the city. Would do it again. Leisurely way to see the cityscape. Half an hour trip. We thought it was money well spent.,,,
,,Great view,5,,"Do try the singapore flyer , I went for the last ride at night and found the place empty and no waiting .Its a slow moving ride which takes 45 mins total for one ride, but you get to see fantastic view of singapore city.",,,
,,Wow!,5,,"As a structural engineer this was basically porn to me. All I can say is Wow.
We went 9PM and it was really quiet. The pathway to the actual pods is quite long but the attractions and exhibits along the route was very entertaining and enlightening. The one exhibit explains quite broadly the structural and design aspects of the Flyer and this could be encouraging to future generations of Engineers.
The pod design leaves for an unobstructed view which made the experience just all the better.
Worth every cent and a must do if one is in Singapore",,,
,,The Giant Ferris Wheel.,5,,"This is the first place I visited and a must. At night at 165m in the air, you get a breath taking view of the city. This wheel, is an engineering feat of brilliance and worth every penny! Those that complain about the $33 dollars it costs please keep your thoughts in perspective!!! This is SIngapore and you pay through the nose for everything here even a beer in seven eleven is over 4 dollars!! Any eye in the sky or wheel you go to in any city weather that's London, Niagara falls, it's all the same price but this wheel you get a half an hour!",,,
,,A must do,5,,A must do when visiting Singapore. Beautiful views of the city. Cost is $33 and the turn lasts about 40 minutes. Truly enjoyable.,,,
,,Amazing architecture...amazing views,5,,"We went there on last October , it's really amazing architectural structure and It should definitely in your must travel list in Singapore. I recommend you to visit there on evening after 6pm , because you can have a great view of Singapore with lights. It's very close to gardens by the bay and bay front MRT station.",,,
,,Just a great view,5,,"After reading reviews, I was prepared to be disappointed but I have to say that the 30 minute trip is quite enchanting. Nice to relax and check out all the icons near you. We went just before sunset and it was a lovely transition. We were also lucky enough to see the light show at the Gardens on the Bay. Getting up high to look at the Marina Bay Sands hotel was also interesting. A bit expensive but worth it.",,,
,,Natural High on the Fly,5,,"First time in Singapore to check out some nice accessories for my camera. If short film or photography is your calling and you are a wanderluster on a budget, you can enjoy Singapore. One of the best spots to have aerial shots is on the Singapore Flyer. You can have a great view of the marina and be amazed with the awesome urban planning of Singapore. Gardens and great architecture blend together and the best spot to see all these is on the Flyer. For 33 Singapore dollars, I hopped on for a ride with a friend who conquered her fear of heights. Now that's priceless. Comfortable and safe for kids with airconditioned cabins. For a videographer, it's worth getting that natural high shooting from all angles.All worth it. Hit me up on Instagram: Gironism. Watch some of my aerial videos and timelapses from The Singapore Flyer. Great ride.",,,
,,"""Not Bad""",3,,"Ferris Wheels are not usually my thing. This one at least gives you a good view of the marina bay area. Better to go in the early evening so it wouldn't be that hot plus Gardens by the Bay looks better, top view, all lit up. Good cabin as well.",,,
,,Spectacular views,5,,"The largest ferris wheel in the southern hemisphere, the views are spectacular. Anyone with a fear of heights may experience some difficulties, but we so enjoyed the twenty minutes of viewing time as the Flyer rotated slowly. Cost was reasonable and certainly worth it.",,,
,,Flyer That will make you fly,4,,"Had an good experience with the flyer, almost 45 minutes ride, worth spending time, Tourist guide told us to have either any one of flyer or Marina bay sands skypark.But i would recommend to enjoy both. Can avoid flyer while raining because it stops while lightening. Enjoyed weather and ride.",,,
,,Birds Eye view of Singapore city and harbour,5,,"Due to bad weather our one day got wasted as after buying tickets we were told that it got cancelled. Next day we reached by 10:30 and there was a long queue. It took 30 minutes for our turn to come. All the same it was worth waiting. Huge Airconditioned capsules accommodate 8 people. It turns very slowly and you don't feel any upward or downward motion. Breathtaking view of Singapore city, River and harbour. They have put photos of various places of interest so you can identify them easily. It took 40 minutes to complete one full round. Max height 142 meters.",,,
,,Nice views,4,,"Really nice views from the Singapore Flyer, but is an absolute pain to get to. The nearest MRT station is quite a walk away. It is a bit pricey, but for a first time visitor to Singapore this a great experience.",,,
,,Spectactular Views,4,,Really good views of Singapore city skyline and harbour. Spacious and clean cabins that take you to 165 metres above the ground. Before getting on the flyer you walk thru an instructional area. Well worth the $34.,,,
,,great eperience,5,,very lucky this attraction is free ffrom my SIA stop over had a very great time with friends awesome view of the city,,,
,,The magnificent Singapore is below you!,4,,"I love to brings my kids to Singapore flyer, not only it is a children friendly visiting spot but also the magnificent view you will receive during your time in the capsule. The Marina Bay Area is fully covered when the capsule rise up the to highest point, you can see how organized the country is. And the site is very close to other favorite tourist spots as well. Easy to manage your traveling plan",,,
,,Worth a go!,3,,Been on a few Ferris wheels in my time but this is worth a go on. Bit overcast the day we went on it but still got some excellent photos.,,,
,,Flyer,5,,Beautiful views at night. Cars are glass on all sides and they do not overcrowd them so there is plenty of room to walk around the car and take in the views all around you.,,,
,,First rate view of city,5,,If looking for an overall view of Singapore the city I recommend the Singapore Flyer especially at night. The view of the city is spectacular truly amazing lights and around you certainly get a good idea of how good and peaceful this city is.,,,
,,TOP OF THE WORLD,5,,"Once located and arrived great attraction. Quick ticket box.long proess to get in , bag xray , photo etc. Once in capsule all forgiven. Great views all round , cool cabin, comfortable, smooth. Visability will be affected by weather c onditions but great MUST DO.",,,
,,What a view! A must do in Singapore!,5,,What an experience! The whole ride takes about 30 minutes. We had about 8 people in our section and we were able to move around all sides and take some great photos with 360 degrees of Singapore. This is perfect for a gopro time lapse video too!,,,
,,Amazing views,4,,Stunning views of Singapore. A very enjoyable outing and a must do when visiting. Comfortable cabin and being only with a small group of people it was easy to move around for great photos.,,,
,,360 degree view of Singapore,4,,"Flyer flyer.
This is considered to be worlds larget flyer till the date.
If you want to see overall Singapore view especially city view then flyer is one of the option to visit. Although ticket cost is slightly on higher side.
If you are ok to pay around 37 bucks for flyer then must visit.",,,
,,A good way to see the view of Singapore.,4,,"At $33 per ride, which takes 32 minutes, do make the best of it when you are in the car (of the Flyer). Good to go ONLY on a clear sky day, not when it is raining.
I would say that SGD33 is not really that cheap, so if you can, get a package deal (online) that includes Duck Tour and/or Gardens by the Bay. With a discount (due to a combo package deal), I think it makes the experiences a bit 鈥渃heaper鈥?
The view is great on both sides of the Flyer, and do get good cameras.",,,
,,Singapore from above,4,,I think it's a must destinations for people who visit Singapore for a photography travel like me. It's best if you come at night to take some beautiful bird eye night view of Singapore. But I think it might be bored in the end because you saw almost the same view for about an hour. But it's quite comfortable because they have not more than 10 person in that one big capsule. I saw there's a VIP treatment too. You can check it in their website.,,,
,,Better try once. Once enough.,4,,"All you can do is to enjoy the view. Better go with a person closest to you. Otherwise it gets boring. The view from the peak point is worth to see at least once. It closes at 10PM. I went there just before 10PM after dinner and had zero waiting time. Nice to cool down after dinner, inside is freezing.",,,
,,All about the View!!,5,,"Seated in a glass capsule, you could enjoy looking at the breathtaking view of the Singapore City. If you are lucky you get the capsule to yourself. At one point you are adjacent to Marina Bay Sands.",,,
,,Wonderful views over Singapore.,5,,As a person not usually comfortable with heights I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised to spend 30 or so minutes or so in a spacious pod as it travelled the circumference of the wheel that is the Singapore Flyer. Views over Singapore were spectacular! Wish we had had time to do it at night too! The cost was $33 a revolution with some special additions available.,,,
,,Great vies,4,,Our family of 4 shared our pod with 7 others. It was a comfortable and enjoyable way to see over Singapore. We were lucky to have a clear day so the view was amazing. Worth the visit.,,,
,,Stunning sights!!,5,,Wow what an experience. Do yourself a favour if in Singapore and head to the Singapore Flyer. A wonderful view of the Singapore skyline from 165 metres above the ground. Great family outing.,,,
,,Beware the opening hours,2,,The website and brochures will tell you that the opening hours are from 8.30 till 10.30pm. Don't turn up just before 10pm and expect to get on though. The ticket booth closes at 10pm. That's info worth knowing before you spend money getting there for a late night flight...,,,
,,Singapore's giant wheel,4,,"The wheel is one of the biggest in the world and stands about 40 storeys high. It moves slowly and gives gives a panaromic view of the surroundings, rather than a speed thrill.",,,
,,Take the ticket for 6pm,4,,enter the flyer 10minutes before sunset so when you go up it will be morning when coming down it will be night.take a selfie stick with you but night time the selfies are not clear,,,
,,not to be missed,4,,"If you are going to Singapore the Flyer should not be missed, it will show you the entire Singapore,",,,
,,Good view of city,5,,They have couple capsules with dining options if your feeling romantic . When we arrived we had a bite to eat by the time we were ready to go on the Flyer it was temporarily closed . As thunder storms often roll through its closed until storm clears we returned a few hours later after it cleared up and enjoyed the view I think everyone should get up high and enjoy the view .,,,
,,Bird's Eye View of the Bayfront,4,,The Singapore Flyer ride displays a great view of the Marina Bay Front and the Iconic Marina Bay Sands. Suitable and a must visit for Ferris Wheel Fans. I find that the price is too steep for just 30 minutes ride.,,,
,,What a view.......,5,,"Great easy way to enjoy breathtaking views of wider Singapore. Easy to access, by all means, adjacent to Marina and attractions, slow movement and not heavily packed.",,,
,,Brilliant experience,5,,"Despite the fact that I am afraid of heights, I thoroughly enjoyed my trip on the Flyer. The whole experience was well managed and the ride on the Flyer was smooth and felt very safe. The views are incredible and the 30 minute ride gave enough time to see everything from all sides of the capsule.
If you have travelled via Singapore Airlines, take along proof to get a discount.",,,
,,"Great service, easy to find. Great views and info",5,,This was an event directly from the airport. easy to find and do. Good intro to Singapore and a wonderful experience for someone new to the city.,,,
,,Not worth it,1,,Too expensive (like the rest of Singapore) for what you get and the ride is rather boring. We had to go stand by the side doors to get a view because the main front window had persipitation on and we were angle to see anything,,,
,,Flyer Visit,5,,This is a great way to see Singapore. We went early in the morning and had clear sky and didn't have to queue either. The speed of the wheel is just about perfect and we were able to take some great photos. It is a good one for people who may be a bit scared of heights but are able to try if feeling secure.,,,
,,Different angle to see singapore,4,,A little bit pricey but u can see the beauty of panorama clearly. Suitable for photographer that want to take many views,,,
,,Pricey but nice view,4,,"This gives you a very nice overview of singapore and their skyline. We went here at night and it was amazing. It is very pricey though, so i recommend to ride it at least once.",,,
,,Good,3,,It was a nice experience but the cost is too high.nothing more than $20/- pp. night time is the best to go. Staff very good.,,,
,,Worthless!,1,,This is the best place to get a bird's eye view of Singapore city. Walking distance from the Bayfront MRT station. Not at all crowded. Each round takes around 20 minutes. The ticket prices are high. I would say it's not a value-for-money attraction. But one could click excellent Singapore skyscrapers photograph from here.,,,
,,Great attraction,5,,Thoroughly enjoyed our ride in the flyer. We went at night and the views were spectacular. Good value for money I feel. Lots of little eateries below that I wish I knew about before arrival.,,,
,,On top of the world,5,,"This is an amazing experience , if you think your high in the cable cars your a lot higher on this . The trip takes about 30 minutes and the view of Singapore in every direction is simply fantastic",,,
,,Stunning!,5,,"Went on the flyer, took about 30 minutes to go around, had plenty of photo opportunities of the CBD and marina bay. was definitely worth it! 10/10",,,
,,Amazing. Great Views and a Singapore MUST DO !,5,,"One of those things that you simply must do when you visit Singapore.

The size of the things that carry you up are very spacious, and make you feel very safe.

The speed of them is good as it takes half an hour to do the full circle which is about what you need to see everything.

Price is $S 33 which is OK, but could be a little cheaper, but still not out of the way.

I was a little surprised at the lack of food places as was planning to have some lunch, but nothing really that was suitable.

I would rate the attraction as a 9/10, the food available 6/10 and transportation a 5/10

A tad surprised that no MRT close by.. Maybe that is under way or planned... as everything in Singapore is..",,,
,,Sensational views!!,5,,This is value for money!! The view of Singapore from The Flyer is amazing and well worth the money. Photographs can be taken with out the glare from being inside. Air-conditioning makes for a very pleasant ride.,,,
,,Amazing views,4,,"Great view to get an overview of Singapore. Second time we have done this trip this time doing it with friends who hadn't been before. The only down side we saw was last time we went (about 5 years ago) there was a description as you went around of the sights you were seeing, this time it is not available, so for people not going before you sometimes don't know what you are looking at.",,,
,,It was a great way to get my bearings,5,,I enjoyed it and so did my 4 year old. It goes really slowly and is very safe. The views are amazing. Carriages were clean and the lines not long. We got the combo pass from duck and hippo,,,
,,Bird's view of the country,4,,"You can either do this or marina bay or both depending on your budget coz thay have the same view of the bay,the merlion , etc . Experience this coz its the best. If travelling by mrt from little india take return ticket . get down at promenade visit flyer and merlion and depart from Raffles Place",,,
,,kids love the view,3,,"quite expensive but my kids love to ride here, and we always ride in a roller when we visit other countries. We bought are photos for souvenir.",,,
,,Interesting,5,,It is like London Eye well maintained and very beautiful. Good view of Singapore from top. One of important visiting place in Singapore.,,,
,,General review,4,,Singapore river is flowing down. A whole city is visible. Wheel is spinning slowly..quite a view. Singapore has really build every thing beautiful.,,,
,,Beautiful ride,5,,Def a must do while in singapore - took my visiting family a few times - sun set is perfect! See the city in the light and with lights!,,,
,,Amazing view over singapore city,5,,"In my opinion it's more spectacular in night rather than day time. With blue lights it's slowly moves you to the top of Singapore city with a breathtaking view of the skyline. very close to gardens by the bay, Marina bay sands. Well worth the visit.",,,
,,Awesome views... Must do,1,,"Singapore Flyer is a must do !!! Great views. Can walk around the carriage and great photo opportunities.. We did on first day of stay, it helped us gain our bearing & where tourists sites are located.. Try for a weekday as weekends are very busy, and long lines.",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"This is well worth doing, the biggest Ferris wheel on earth. Fantastic views over the Singapore river, Marina Bay Sands and Grand Prix pit lane area.After riding on the Ferris wheel treat yourself to a foot massage by hundreds of fish near the exit.",,,
,,Good expeirence,4,,Nice place from where you can see the entire city. the flyer is similar to the London eye and the view of the city is amazing at night.,,,
,,Best at Night,5,,"After our very long sweaty walk from Mandarin Oriental to Gardens By The Bay then over to the Singapore Flyer, we were in need of a seat and some air conditioning, Luckily enough we arrived late enough to miss the crowd, no buses there at that time either, I walked up to the ticket counter with only a couple of people in front, then through security, then just about straight into a Pod.
There were about 10 people in the Pod so we had plenty of room to move and it was air conditioned so we were cool, I have a fear of heights which I seem to be getting over quicker with each visit to Singapore, so I was worried how I would go, this was another reason I wanted to go at night, as I have found it easier.
The View was excellent as we were lucky enough to have had a clear night, the first half of the ride is nice but it really is brilliant as you come over the crest and get an uninterrupted view of Singapore.
I loved the way the Flyer lights up and changes colours of the Pods, and that they move slow enough so you don't feel like your moving, very much like The Eye in London.
I really enjoyed my experience on the Singapore Flyer.",,,
,,Tips for making your trip worthwhile,4,,"Here are some tips for making your trip worthwhile

1. Only visit this place on a clear day this means avoid going on hazy days
2. purchase the discounted tickets on groupon, there are always deals going on groupon singapore and hence there is no need to pay full price
3. parking is very expensive at the flyer. You may consider taking taxi or MRT to the attraction",,,
,,Good to kill time...,3,,"Good to kill time, nice views but not really worth doing. Might be best to visit at night time...during the day it's a little boring.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,3,,"Strange name for a wheel? However, this will give you 32 minutes to view the skyline of Singapore, but not Malaysia on a good day as the brochures suggest. @ S$33, it is difficult to say if it is value for money.",,,
,,Great way to enjoy the city view from above,5,,Fantastic view of the city in a quiet spacious capsule. We had it to ourselves maybe because it was mid morning. Movement was slow enough that it wasn't noticeable. Loved it!,,,
,,Must try,5,,"We had amazing time at the Singapore flyer, the view is amazing fom the top of this giant weel,
You can see the full view if the city and enjoy the nice buildings, you also can see marina bay sand hotel, marina bay garden, and many things...",,,
,,Nice but not unique,3,,"Its nice but nothing spectacular, its same like London eye or any other giant wheel. You can see the city any other way too, the ticket price may put off a family.",,,
,,Amazing views of the city,4,,"Worth a trip on the flyer for the views alone. We went in the evening when everything is lit up, spectacular views of the city.",,,
,,Christmas present,5,,"Me and my lil Mia had a Christmas present from her mum and dad, it was such a great time for me to have her on my own, just me and her enjoying it , though the first moment we got it in Mia got nervous a bit but shes getting excited till then..We enjoyed it and just feeling so good when we were in the top watching the lights around Singapore....",,,
,,Bird's eye view of the Marina Bay,5,,"It's a 30 minutea capsule ride (fits about 20 people comfortably) of a giant ferris wheel located in the Marina Bay Singapore. There are a number of food outlets here.

Operating hours I think 9am to 10pm. We took ours at 10pm the last rides. Ticket S $33 for adults and S $21 for kids.

How to get there:
By MRT (subway) it's cheaper if travelling less than 4 people, more than 4 taxi is cheaper. By MRT stop at Promenade Station (Circle Line CC4) Exit A, then take around 5 minutes walk to Singapore Flyer",,,
,,Breathtaking view,4,,When u visit Singapore it is a must do. It's near the gardens by the bay and with an aerial view of Singapore. Ther aerial view is of the gardens by the bay / marina bay sands / new football stadium and other areas,,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,This is a great way to view all the surrounding areas that you might not get time to go to. Very well organised and you do feel your getting your moneys worth. Lots of photo opportunities.,,,
,,You can see our house from up here!,5,,Great views and a different perspective than from MBS or some of the other observation points. Essex costly great views out across Marina and Gardens by the Bay,,,
,,Wondeful,4,,Nice experience. Good view of Singapore when you reach the top. It takes around 30-40 min for the complete circle. A must see,,,
,,Wow what a view,5,,The flyer is best just as the is going down or mid afternoon. It gives you a great perspective of Singapore and its amazing buildings. The diversity of this place is great. The photo opportunities are amazing.,,,
,,One of a kind in Asia!,5,,Very nice experience. Make sure you board the wheel late evening - so you'd cover the sights in natural light as well as when the city lights up in the night,,,
,,Once is enough,3,,"We went to the Singapore flyer for the first time. The hub moves so slow as we were 30 minutes inside. It was interesting to see the scenery of Singapore at night. There was a little problem with the E-Ticket, but the lady in the entrance could solve it quick and full of smile.",,,
,,Great views,4,,I'd definitely recommend this attraction. Not too expensive and you spend thirty minutes on your 'flight'. We went at about 1130 on a Sunday morning and it wasn't busy. You get great views across the city and out to sea.,,,
,,Must Visit,5,,"This been my 3rd times to visit Singapore Flyer! And never get bored to ride the flyer! Awesome view

I went with my mom and she used wheelchair as she cant walk quite far. At first, I'm bit worried about how she get there ... And guess what? The staff are so helpful and they even stopped the flyer only for my mom can go up or go down from the flyer! I was so amazed!

Thank you for your kindness and caring! I will definitely go here again if i have spare time",,,
,,Awesome ride,5,,It was an amazing experience. really worth a try...It has a a fantastic view of the whole city of Singapore. Highly recommended...,,,
,,Amazing views from the top,5,,The Singapore flyer is worth visiting. The views are amazing and you get to see a lot of Singapore.You can even get a glimpse of Indonesia and Malaysia from the top. There are a lot of shops surrounding the Singapore flyer as well as restaurants so you could spend a good half a day there or more if you wanted to. There is a lovely garden area at the base of the flyer to enjoy as well.,,,
,,rather boring the ride,5,,The flyer is actually a slow crawler stopping ever minute give it a miss expensive as well and the cue at the cashier soo slow,,,
,,Worth the money,5,,"Great view of the bay and city, definitely worth the money. Small food court and shopping centre at the base was a bit shabby but reasonably priced.",,,
,,Go and see Singapore day and night!,5,,if it's your first time in Singapore then you must try this! View from the top are simply impressive and you can see how clean and beautiful Singapore is!,,,
,,As good as ever,4,,A great way to see panoramic views of Singapore and how it is changing over the years - third time in last 6/7 yrs we have been on it and can really see the changes.,,,
,,Awesome ride,5,,Best view of Singapore great experience and photo shots. This is such a calm experience as the ride hardly appears to be moving abs you can freely walk around and take photos from so many angles.,,,
,,Just do it!,5,,"What an amazing experience flying high over Singapore. Our only problem was whether to do this at night or during the day, and we opted for during the daytime - which was just amazing. We could clearly see the gardens, MBS and over the entire city. The cabins take up to 26 people, and all together there was only 4 of us so we had the best views. if you are not sure about this attraction, I say just do it!",,,
,,Over hyped,2,,Too expensive and over hyped. Not worth the money you spend. Sitting in glass box and getting to see the bird eye view of singapore is fine for one time. However you getter view from marina bay observatory.,,,
,,Beautiful View,4,,We were on a pod I would call it by our self so were able to move all around it the view was fantastic you could see all over Singapore and all the Ships waiting to enter the port Stunning,,,
,,"""awesome view""",5,,"must visit on list, top view is the best part. visit during weekdays as you may get empty capsule so you may take a lot of photos",,,
,,Amazing,5,,If you are visiting Singapore you have to do this. Make sure you are not afraid of highs. Lol. Incredible experience and amazing views.,,,
,,"Good , But slightly expensive",4,,Very good for birds eye view on Singapore . It takes 30 mins for completion of one round. . Very good for family . But at slightly higher cost 33 Singapore $,,,
,,Birds Eye View of Singapore Skyline and Harbour,4,,Must to go. It's a 5 min walk from promenade MRT station. Takes about 45 mins to compete one round in which you can enjoy spectacular Ariel view of Singapore skyline.,,,
,,A Must Ride Flyer,4,,"As per my suggestion Its a must ride flyer for all travellers, its basically an observation deck, you can explore whole Singapore from the top. Total duration of the ride was appx. 25-30 mins.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,Great Views . We visited during Day time.. takes about 1 and 1/2 to 2 hours to complete out n in including 1/2 hour in the flyer . There was not much waiting when we reached around 4.30pm . Great Views of Singapore Harbour n Marina Bay Esplanade Merlion Park Fullerton Hotel n Lovely MBS hotel .. both day views n night views are WORTH the Visit .. must visit once atleast to get the TRUE Singapore feel ..,,,
,,An experience not to be missed,5,,Make a visit on the Flyer after dark for a special flight experience. The views of Singapore at night are certainly worth it. We were also lucky to witness a firework display for an event taking place at the Marina Shoppes Mall.,,,
,,Getting High in Singapore,4,,"Dinner on a Ferris Wheel anyone?

Well if you want to be romantic this could be the spot. Book a table and enjoy the view out over the city as you slowly climb and descend again on this wheel.

You can also just ride the Flyer and enjoy the views, either way this is a fun venue and you get to see the city from a different perspective.",,,
,,Fantastic Experience!!!,5,,"It is a must have experience if you come to Singapore. You will get an amazing experience while seeing the many iconic places in Singapore. The tour is about 30 mins. It is a calm ride which every one can enjoy. If you are travelling from MRT, you can alight at Promenade station and walk to Singapore Flyer without any hassle.",,,
,,great,5,,"i and my friends occupied 1 car, we visited in the afternoon. the queue was not long, so it was very fast :) recommended to visit Singapore flyer.",,,
,,Awesome views,4,,"Take in the awesome panoramic views from the spacious pods. See for miles on a clear day with 360 degrees views of the city, gardens and bay. Seating available, relax, enjoy or move about so you can snap away and take the memories with you. Also available at the centre is a small tropical forest, dinning, shopping, ice cream and a fish foot spa. Pricing is reasonable, but look on line for some special deals ;)",,,
,,Nice,4,,Very Nice Place But Costly....Staff Is good...Flyer is one of the Most Popular in Singapore...Flayer Condition Is Good...,,,
,,Stopover activity,4,,Really enjoyed this slow 1/2hr trip on this huge wheel. Excellent views of Singapore & only 4 of us in a capsule that could take about 24!,,,
,,Excellent Views,5,,"We went to the Singapore flyer as part of a tour we had booked.
It was really great to ride it and the views are awesome.
This was my very first time in one of these wheels and I really enjoyed it. It is one of the largest in the world.
There is a cost to this however it is worth it.
Make sure you take your camera.
The ride takes around 30 minutes.",,,
,,Wonderful,5,,London Eye eat your heart out. Superb attraction and as you will see the views across the bay to the esplanade and surroundings are truly spectacular and well worth the modest charges. Recommend that you do the trip at night time.,,,
,,Worth doing if your in the area and want to get a sense of the city and its scale,5,,"The flyer itself is hassle free. Once you get to the flyer location either by car, or MRT (its a short 5 minute walk from the nearest station), you just follow the signs and get your ticket. The staff are friendly and the pre flyer show details how the flyer was built, what was there in its place, facts and figures about the wheel which is educational and allows you to grasp the scale of the wheel itself.

Once your on the wheel, its like any other wheel in the world in that is slowly goes around. I think the total flight time was about 30 minutes and the experience in the glass pods is smooth and you hardly notice your going up or coming down. The view is 360 and you can take a look all the way out to sea and watch why the shipping port is one of the busiest in the world, as there's cargo tanker upon tank sailing in / out as far as the eye can see.

When I went about 10am in the morning, there wasn't many people about and I got to have an entire pod to myself, which was lovely. It was also a clear day so I had a complete unobstructed line of sight. The scale of the city was a view to behold. You can also see where the f1 circuit is and get a sense of what it must be like during race day.

I also did this same excursion at night to see what the city looked like during periods of darkness. Whilst you dont get to experience as much in terms of sights, the parts close to the flyer which are lit up do look magical. Areas such as the gardens opposite, and the Sands hotel are eye catching, but If i had to pick between day or night id say do the flyer during the day and just go to the same spot at night but not on the flyer itself.",,,
,,A good view,4,,"Worth the trip, but costly. Maybe on par with other things in the city. Better to visit during the day to get a clearer view although some would argue that a lit up city is a better option. I enjoyed the day trip.",,,
,,Interesting,3,,"The Flyer is well situated and we had a beautiful sunset experience. Having a tour guide or Flyer employee on hand to describe the sites and answer questions would have been most helpful, especially as the ride takes at least 30min.
We found the staff helpful with children and friendly. It would be a better experience if they offered family packages with soft drinks and light snacks offered for kids and someone to describe the sights and their relevance. We heard that there were long queues and so purchased our tickets in advance online. We were fortunate that there were no queues but the etickets were a total waste of time. I had to leave my spouse upstairs with the kids and run down to change our tickets - after first going to the office to confirm that our etickets were in order. Most unnecessary.",,,
,,Beautiful view of Singapore,5,,Best to go around 6-7 pm so you will be able to view the day and night of the Singapore skyline along the Singapore River. Big cabin which can accommodate about 10 people and plenty of space to move around.,,,
,,"Great view, especially at night",4,,"We had a round in the flyer at sunset, this proved to be a good timing as the change in sky colour is really fantastic. We were lucky, there were only few people taking the ride, so we had a gondola on out own (7 persons). The view over Marina Bay and Downtown as well as parts of the harbour is incredible, it's absolutely worth it. The only improvements I see is the vouchers you get along with the ride cannot be used in all shops and restaurants in the flyer building, only in the food court. If you don't want to eat there, this is a bit of a rip-off.",,,
,,Great Views!,5,,"The Flyer is a great way to see Singapore! Luckily when we visited we didn't have to queue! There's a few places to eat and drink in the complex if you want refreshment before or after the spin round!
Easy to get to as all the 'hop on' tour buses stop here.",,,
,,Great views,5,,Took a tour on the double decker bus and stopped at the Singapore flyer. Great way to see overview of city and surroundings. Lines were short and facility clean and modern.,,,
,,I'm claustrophobic and still enjoyed it,5,,"I was hesitant to go on this because I'm claustrophobic but I had nothing to worry about. The pods are large and air conditioned. I may not have been so calm if it was full of people though. There were about 8 in our pod and there was plenty of room to move around.
View was lovely.",,,
,,Nice but can be better,3,,"singapore is a nice city and around the area of the flyer, the night view was superb. i cannot comment about the price as it was a gift ticket from friend.
the things that i believe could make flyer much better would be the operation arrangement on the queuing. i understood that it was a popular site, yet, the queuing arrangement was somewhat complicated and require a real walk. the other comment would be on transportation as the site was not so accessible.",,,
,,Loved it,5,,We went at dusk and it was stunning! You see everything from the Marina Bay Sands to the starting grid for the F1. It's beautiful when you see the whole place lit up.,,,
,,Brilliant,5,,"Well worth visiting if you're in Sing, brilliant views and well worth the money - definite top atrtaction",,,
,,Singapore City Tour !,4,,A better view of the greater Singapore Marina Bay area from the air. Add 2 bus city tours to complement your experience. Booking is easily done online with hotel pickup. Best on forecasted clear sunny days and also to enjoy with family and friends !,,,
,,Could see complete city as an eagle eye.,5,,"It was good but only if you have good company with you as you will be moving to top of city view on Flyer moving slowly one round to get pictures & see beauty of place.

This could be little expensive but going one time is worth.
Do not forget to click photo while entrance & get that printed covering all attractions by professional.",,,
,,Awesome from top of the flyer,5,,We have enjoyed an awesome view from the top of the flyer. Whole city can be explore from the flyer. It's a very good attraction for kids and of course for adult too. Everyone who wish to visit Singapore must take the taste of this ride.,,,
,,Really Amazing Romantic Place,5,,It was a great trip to this flyer It was in hooney moon and we enjoyed the slow circle that takes around 40 mins along with the great views and we were lucky to get a private cabin never miss it,,,
,,5 day visit,5,,"My husband took me up in the evening of my birthday, Singapore all lit up was such a fantastic sight. Another must for visitors to Singapore.",,,
,,For bird's eye view of the city,4,,"It was a good experience. The flyer offers a great view over the city. However it takes about half an hour to complete the round which seems little long. After the initial 10 minutes or so, you get over the initial awe and amazingne of the scenery and after clicking a few pictures , it gets a little tedious and you start to wait for the circle to complete.",,,
,,IF you want to have an eagle view of singapore,4,,Singapore flyer is located on the bay of singapore.The ticket will cost you around 33 $ .The view from the singapore flyer is just amazing.,,,
,,Excellent views,5,,"Great experience, wonderful views over the old and new Singapore. Looking around at the developing surroundings forever changing! Give it a go this year and the next visit go again and you will see something different!",,,
,,Excellent to be on a flyer at least once,5,,30 min of flyer showing amazing Singapore. One get to see an Excellent view of Singapore from the top.,,,
,,See it by Night,4,,"Its very beautiful to see the city by night. The wheel moves very slowly and quietly, the wheel does not stop to get in or get out. Its worth a view, the tickets are expensive, but its worth. The cabins are airconditioned and well maintained.",,,
,,Spectacular views of Marina Bay!,5,,"Took a ride on the Singapore Flyer in the evening and the views of Singapore & Marina Bay are amazing! Some might think the price of the tickets are too high, but I believe the price is justified because the Flyer is so big and each circular car is large enough for about a dozen people. You can also book a dinner on the Singapore Flyer and they have dining cars set-up just for this purpose.",,,
,,what a great view,5,,"Well where do we start, the views were amazing, we did have a bit of cloud but we managed to see all around. Then we went back at night all lite up it was beautiful, all different colours, we stood looking at them for ages.",,,
,,happy ride up the singapore flyer.,4,,Beautiful view and love to go for 2 rounds and see the night scene and so beautiful and relaxing. worth to see it. too bad cannot sit down if only it is cheaper will be best,,,
,,Wonderful sights,5,,"This was on my wish list upon arriving in singapore, and it did not disappoint. The views were spectacular, air-conditioned and pleasant. Highly recommend.",,,
,,Vith a view!,5,,"Need no explanation. Just lineup and and go. Well worth it. We went round twice. Perfect photo opportunities. We went with our children, they still talks about it. Every time we are in Singapore, which is often due to work, I send them a photo of the Eye.",,,
,,Fantastic views.,5,,"Its hard to find a spare hour or so in Singapore but if you can this is pretty much a must do!! We booked the tickets and went straight in, judging by the pathway you walked along it looks as if there could be quite long queues at peak times. We were lucky and only had to wait for one pod to fill before our turn. The views are fabulous in every direction and it moves slow enough to enjoy it all. Good value for money.",,,
,,"Great Technology, pricey",4,,"Before you go on board the Singapore Flyer, your tour guide will mostly give you a background of how the Flyer was built. And that's when you realize it's a marvel of technology..!! Each of the carriages weights around 11-14 tons, so imagine the strength of the frame holding over 25 of these carriages. The view from the top is ecstatic but it's similar to the view from the top of the Marina Bay sands. But a ride on the flyer is quite a dent on the pocket, so it really seems like you paid around 3k (Indian Rupees) for a ride on a Big Giant wheel",,,
,,Must Watch,5,,"This is a must watch view if you are visiting Singapore. This is a 40 minutes ride in the flyer, where you can see the complete view of Singapore from the top.",,,
,,Interesting ride,4,,We went in a group of 3 persons. It was a weekday so it was not crowded at all. Tickets were quite expensive and i think for this price at least the attraction can consider to provide a free mineral water! Ride is not scary at all and there is a bench in each ride for visitors to sit and admire the scenery. We have to share a capsule with strangers as it's just 3 of us. Think they can fit 6 pax in a capsule. Ride is short it lasted 10 minutes.,,,
,,Expensive view from the top,4,,"The flyer is safe and slow, affords a good aerial view and photo ops that obviously, cannot be replicated street level. Pricey, if taken alone. Look for combo promos available in the brochures found at the airport.",,,
,,Nice cleare view,4,,Have a great view of the Singapore City. Near to Marina Bay Sands shopping mall..... Gradens by the bay,,,
,,Amazing view of the downdtown,5,,"We did it at sunset, there were no lines and the view was just breathtaking. Am afraid of heights, but the flyer is very stable and smooth and once you get to the 10% tour, you feel relaxed and start enjoying the ride.",,,
,,High-time experience (even for such high-sicks as myself),5,,"Giant observation wheel (some say it's the biggest in Asia or even in the world). Some people say that you can see Malaysia and Indonesia on a clear & bright day, but I - as a terrible high-sick - chose the night time with its gorgeous illumination and night city panorama. For posh options you can choose special packages (including private cabin hire for a meal). Great souvenir shop on the 2nd floor. Enjoy Singapore's street food trail (night market) - cheap & mouthful",,,
,,A must do,5,,"Terrific experience, wife frightened of heights, you could not tell you were moving thou roughly enjoyable.",,,
,,Birds eye view,2,,I think the ticket for singapore is over priced as comparison to view . No doubt the view is beautiful but still it's not a must watch for travellers with limited budgeted .,,,
,,Amazing views,5,,Well worth a visit while in Singapore. We were fortunate to visit at a quiet time of the day and had a whole gondola to ourselves. Spectacular view on even a cloudy day.,,,
,,The place to be!,5,,A must go! Please book your tickets 30mins prior to Sunset so that you can see the whole view when you are at the top and then you can see the lights when its dark. Duration around 1hour.,,,
,,Flyer vs Eye,4,,"Fantastic views of Singapore harbor and downtown areas. Cost is $33 but everything in Singapore is quite expensive. Not as impressive to us as the London Eye but perhaps that is because there are so many recognizable landmarks in London.
It was not busy at 2:00PM and we had the huge car to ourselves. Worth a try!",,,
,,"Night time, bit boring during the day",3,,I would take advantage of this at night time. You get one turn around that takes half an hour. Pretty good.,,,
,,great way to see the city,5,,this was a great way to see most of Singapore Even though i am terrified of heights it was okay if i stayed in the middle i was okay. they also have dinning on some cars which would be a different experience. .,,,
,,Great views,5,,Fun way to spend a few hours. We went on a weekday afternoon and there were no crowds. The views were spectacular since it was a clear day.,,,
,,Wonderful view of Singapore,4,,You will get an amazing view of the Singapore city from the flyer and you can click a lot of good photos of the same during the flight. The ride was slow and there is a plenty of time to enjoy the beautiful view during this time. Recommend this as a must do thing in Singapore.,,,
,,Once ONLY!,5,,This ride is scary as hell...I am afraid of heights and this did not make me feel safe...but that's cause I was scared...beautiful views though.,,,
,,Peaceful 360 view of Singapore!,5,,"We went there in the afternoon, view is beautiful specially watching the sunset and lights of garden by the bay or marina bay",,,
,,At the top,4,,"You can see almost all Singapore by this flyer when reach at the top it鈥檚 too slow but lovely,for both",,,
,,Singapore flyer.,5,,"What a fabulous way to see the city. We went on day 2 of our trip so already we knew places to look for and see them from above. Very peaceful, no queues at 10.00am. A must do!!",,,
,,Fantastic Views and Almost no Queues in the morning,5,,Fantastic views - bring your cameras and selfie sticks! Come by early to avoid long lines - virtually no queues when we were there. A very pleasant half hour on the flyer indeed.,,,
,,Singapore from the top,5,,"This gives a nice view good view of Singapore from the top. We visited in the morning and the queue was very short. You can see the well known places in the Marina Bay area from different angles. There are boards inside the capsule that mentions different attractions. Capsule can accommodate 8-10 people and should not be a problem even for people who does not like heights.
Ticket costs S$33 and the total time the flyer takes is 30minutes. This is one of an experience and would recommend.",,,
,,Wonderful views,5,,"We visited the Singapore flyer on our short 4 day visit to Singapore. This is an attraction that you do not want to miss. It is the second largest wheel in the world, much bigger than the London Eye. it has a quite slow rotation so that you have plenty of time to enjoy the amazing views, there are all of the facilities that you would normally expect at a tourist attraction , shop refreshments etc. We could not purchase a photo of our trip as I had forgotten my credit card and had American dollars which were not acceptable and too few Singapore dollars (Photo was quite expensive)",,,
,,Excellent,5,,"It was very nice experience in here, we were told it is the highest but soon the flyer in dubai( i think) will break it's record.
In 30 min. We saw whole singapore and some parts of malaysia also. Very very good experience.",,,
,,Best way to see the entire city,3,,The Singapore flyer offers visitors a chance to see the entire city. We didn't feel anything especially on descent. The staff were very attentive and helpful.,,,
,,Pam Sullivan,5,,The Singapore Flyer is huge. I am frightened of heights however I felt very secure in the large capsule. As there were only two of us on board our capsule you could move freely around taking photos at leisure. The ride moves so slowly that you are not really even aware of it moving . Getting on and off the ride was not difficult.,,,
,,Worth a ride,5,,"If in Singapore, Singapore Flyer is a must visit. a peaceful ride with a breathtaking view of the city. Those suffering from a phobia of height need not worry, the speed of the flyer is very slow that you dont realise that you have touched down already. the staff is extremely courteous and guide you well.",,,
,,Great Views,5,,"Visited during the day, we didn't have to wait long and there wasn't a queue. Plenty of room as we only had one other couple in the cubicle. The views were fantastic and we got some great photos. One more item off the bucket list as its the largest wheel in the world.",,,
,,Amazing views by day or night,4,,"You just can't go wrong with this attraction as it is in a super location so that you can take advantage of other attractions that are close by - especially at the time of Chinese New Year which is when we go there.

Built on the shore of the Singapore River, there are 28 walk in pods that are beautifully illuminated at night and you can take this ride until 11pm at night. It is suitable for all ages and if you have travelled with Singapore Airlines and you have your boarding cards with you, you can get a very healthy discount on your flyer tickets.

If there is low cloud cover and it is raining I prob ably wouldn't advise that you take this tour - it really is better value for money if you go at a time when the skies are clear.",,,
,,Loved it,5,,You should be warned in advance this is much more than a large ferris wheel. It is safe but HUGE. Great views.,,,
,,Excellent views,5,,So glad we went on this. It was not busy so we did not have to wait very long to board. It was nice to be able to view Singapore from there,,,
,,See the area o of Singapore and nice 30 minute trip.,5,,"A nice way to see the Singapore area. You are in an enclosed capsule with windows all around. Go early in the morning or late afternoon. Check the times as the Flyer has specific times and closes late afternoon, early evening.",,,
,,It was Beautiful,4,,The place was beautiful.It was fun after getting in the capsule.It moves slow.but you can enjoy the overall views,,,
,,Good orientation for the City,4,,"We went on the Flyer mid-day in April, the low season. No liines and we had the entire capsule to ourselves, which was nice, as we could roam all over looking out in every direction. It is a good orientation/overview of the City. $33 SG per person. The ride itself is about 30-35 minutes. The getting there takes a bit. There is what looks like a nice series of eating booths on the ground level, with a nice, open eating area. Several shops in the complex. You can also have your feet exfoliated by fish at one of the spas!",,,
,,Worth doing once,3,,"One of the things our kids had on their bucket list in singapore was a ride on the singapore flyer. How could we not!!
While we enjoyed it, it wasnt the highlight of our trip. For the price we paid, I can think of hetter ways to spend our money. Our cart was full and to get a photo you had to wait for everyone else to move. The view was nice but there are cheaper more forfilling ways to see it!",,,
,,Good view but not great,3,,It provides a Good view but not great at all. Its a capsule which moves slowly. just for first time experience its good but dont expect some out of the world view.,,,
,,Very good,4,,"Very good. a little off track , except for F1 but a great view of the City sights.easy to get with MRT station.",,,
,,The cubes on the Singapore Flyer are memorable experience to be in.,5,,The fantastic view on top of the Singapore Flyer is a good experience. We can see everything underneath it. When the place is crowded - there is no chance to go up at all.,,,
,,Disgusting meal,1,,"Our last night in Singapore and had booked for dinner on Flyer. Big Mistake. Had to walk some distance as roads still closed due to Grand Prix, only received notification from Flyer after the event. Signage as to where you went poor. Got to the ""lounge"" and tried to order a drink, gave up after tried three choices and they had none despite having them on menu, which was held together with duck tape. Then to dinner. Soup luck warm, main bit of chicken and disgusting veges and beef kebabs, 2 pieces of meat on stick again disgusting veges. Dessert a piece of dried up cake on plate.
Positives the waiter that tried his best and was very friendly and the wonderful view as we went round twice. Suggest if you want to go, just go for the view NOT the meal.",,,
,,Dont miss,4,,"A very good ride. Can view the entire Singapore from here. An awesume view for photographers. It moves very slowly, so not everyone will find it interesting.",,,
,,A nice experience for Asians,5,,"You will get a nice view of the city , And gives a world class experience for a affordable price , Try to visit in the Morning.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"It was very quiet - I got on straight away - and the views were lovely although it was a little hazy. It was very cheap compared to both The London Eye and The Melbourne Star, which was a bonus and you could see many of the main landmarks such as the Gardens by the Bay and also right across the Harbour. Well worth the money",,,
,,Fantastic views of Singapore,5,,We really enjoyed the Singapore it was very peaceful and relaxing and we got some great photos and had time to chat with others from different parts of the world whilst taking in the sights,,,
,,Great views over Singapore,4,,When on the flyer during a recent holiday in Singapore. Great views all round the bay area of the city.,,,
,,Must experience,4,,A good experience. Takes around 30 minutes for a rotation. You can have a complete view of Singapore city.,,,
,,Great views and photos,5,,"This is the tallest wheel in the world at 165 feet and the views are well worth the trip, it is 30 minutes round trip and if you love photography it is well worth it",,,
,,An amazing view,5,,"An amazing view of the city. You can see everything, fun for families as well as couples. A calm and fun ride showing the best Singapore has to offer. Very recommended.",,,
,,Super view,5,,Can't miss in Singapore. Go near sun set. Enjoy the beautiful lighting on bay. About 30 minutes ride.,,,
,,The highlight of my trip,5,,"We scheduled the flyer experience on the last day of our trip as to see the places from the birds eyeview after we have toured by hop on bus for 2 days. We went there on time of the sunset and Singapore looks so beautiful at night. Good for night photography, plus there was a wedding in one of the car :) A must when going to Singapore.",,,
,,Big Wheel,3,,"We went to the flyer as part of a tour, but had to pay an additional $33 to ride. It was in an air conditioned car that moved slowly so even for the most heights challenged, it was easy",,,
,,Flying high!,5,,Awesome views on a clear day! :) Good value for money. We had a pod to ourselves. Friendly staff all throughout.,,,
,,"Well worth a wizz on the Singapore Flyer, amazing views.",5,,"Well worth a wizz on the Singapore Flyer, amazing views of Singapore. It helped us get our bearings of the city and surrounds.",,,
,,Amazing Views,4,,"Best way to see Singapore from above. This beats any other option available in Singapore. If you fly in with Singapore Airlines keep your boarding pass and you will recieve a discount. We went on the flyer during the day, the views were amazing. The modulars are quite big and roomy so easy to move around to capture all the views. The ride goes for 30 mins. There is a place there to buy refreshments and food. Close to Marina Bay and Gardens by the Bay so you can walk to each.",,,
,,Relaxing and great view,5,,The que was short. April is a lean season only few group tours that we saw. The view of the city was spectacular. The ride was slow and relaxing. The wagons are cooled and great photo ops. There are hawker food stalls below but pricey. It gets very hot around the area in the noon time. There were big coi fish below the flyer. There's a 7-12 store where you can buy water and other food. The toilets are not that clean though. We found it hard to get a taxi back home.,,,
,,"Great views, expensive",3,,"A pretty expensive attraction for what it is but offers views of the whole city and further. Having said that, everything is comparably expensive in Singapore and this area want too crowded and let's you have a nice airconditioned time out if you've been sight seeing on your feet all day.",,,
,,fun time,5,,"A very nice experience ,enjoyable by kids and adults .Great photo op and wonderful views from the top.",,,
,,Great Views Of Singapore,5,,This a must attraction. Great views of Singapore and great value for money. Go early in the morning to avoid the queues and you might get a capsule to yourself.,,,
,,a definite must do...,5,,Great views at night but hard to get good pics. Went on the last trip for the day around 21h15. many specials to include a drink or meal but only saw these upon arrival and it was too late to purchase any of the these so maybe go earlier and you might get better pics around sunset. everything is efficient and there are some photo set ups against a green screen where they add the flyer in thereafter but these were a little expensive for a few photos. highly recommend this for a birds eye view of the city.,,,
,,Great wiew of singapore,4,,If you have been in marina bay sands dont need to be there again it was the same wiew especially in the night yoy must see the wiew,,,
,,Worth the visit,4,,"I really enjoyed this ""flight"" and thought it well worth the visit. The area that it is situated means that it gives a great view over the different parts of the city and out to the Indonesian islands. I'd advise to go just as the night sky draws in to get the full benefit of the night skyline and the light display.",,,
,,Pleasant experience,4,,"This wan't on our original plan for things to do in Singapore, but we ended up enjoying it. Great views, and the ability to move around and take pictures from within the car was great. We went in the evening and could still see many things all around the area.",,,
,,Great view,5,,"If you can't afford to stay in a big hotel tower by the bay, you get a great birds eye view of the city from the Flyer. Good access and reasonable prices.",,,
,,Sunset trip,5,,We boarded about 30 minutes before sunset.Fantastic views of the bay and city.The capsules are very comfortable and spacious allowing one to wander around and enjoy all round views,,,
,,Great view of the city,4,,"Have a great view of the Singapore City. Near to Marina Bay Sands shopping mall, the Casino and the Garden by the bay. Easy access to other shopping area such as Bugis Junction and Suntec conventional hall that hold many events and exhibitions.",,,
,,Excellent,4,,We went on the flier at night time. We had fabulous views of the city and were lucky enough to get a pod to ourselves (5 Adults) It takes about 30 mins and was simply spectacular. One to do if in Singapore,,,
,,The world's largest observation wheel,5,,"This giant observation wheel offers 360-degree city views, a panorama that stretches to parts of Malaysia and Indonesia on a clear day.

The whole of singapore is great to look in the evening.Don't miss this ride.Its also awesome to look from such an altitude.Wow experience for me!!!!!",,,
,,What a view!,4,,The Singapore Flyer should be on everyone's must do list for Singapore. It is located very close to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Gardens by the Bay. The complete ride takes just over 30 minutes and you get a spectacular view of Singapore while you are on the top or close to it. We found that although there was a queue waiting to board it moves quite quickly and before you knew it you were sitting in your Gondola going around.,,,
,,Expensive. If your hotel view is good then don't waste your money,3,,"There were 11 of us and the price for tickets was expensive. It's nothing wow, you get to see the view which our hotel had any ways. There are other places to visit and see so save your money for this as Singapore is generally expensive",,,
,,Spectzcular,5,,The view from the top was amazing and i recommend doing it at night to see the city lights and the light show put on by marina bay sands.,,,
,,Amazing!!!!,5,,I'm a little apprehensive re heights but there was no fear where this adventure was concerned. Absolutely spectacular!! The views were simply breathe-taking and awesome. would do again and again!!,,,
,,Awesome Experience,5,,A must go attraction in Singapore. It provides almost the whole view of Singapore. A good site for those looking forward to do a Time Lapse videos.......,,,
,,Spectacular Views,5,,"This is the worlds largest observation wheell 165m from the ground. The wheel turns at a very relaxed pace with air conditioning giving a pleasant escape from the humidity of the city. There are also a wide range of shops, restaurants, bars, activities and facilities.",,,
,,Really good,5,,"Great for a view of the region, try and time the sunset for an extra special view, kids enjoyed it as well! Well recommended",,,
,,The best view of Singapore.,5,,It is a slow half an hour ride and you can see best part of Singapore's water front. There are many other activities in the same premises.,,,
,,Great views from this ride,5,,The Singapore Flyer is a great way to see Singapore from on high. Not as high as the Marina Sands Skypark but worth the money. It goes very slow so you have plenty of time to look,,,
,,Worth visiting,5,,"This is one of the star attractions. The view from the flyer is awesome. Check the tour tickets as your ticket may include a complimentary gift. While you get out, dont forget to fetch a pitchure of your family on the flyer (charges applicable). Do not buy souvenir from any shops as they r twice or thrice costlier than that available in the market.",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,Had a great time on Singapore flyer. Fantastic views over Singapore. A definite must do. You can hardly feel the wheel move but you are up very high!!!,,,
,,24 SGD ONLY FOR SENIOR LOCAL?,3,,"I'm very surprise to pay 33 SGD me and my wife, each other aged 68 years old???? For local senior only 24 SGD",,,
,,Nice city view,4,,You can get a good view across Singapore. Must visit if I are not spending more than 2 days to look at the entire city in a bird's view,,,
,,Easy way to see the sights of Singapore,4,,"I travelled with my 3 children aged 8,4 and 1. We arrived at the flyer at about 9:30am on a Thursday and bought tickets straight away and walked straight up to the flyer. We were in a pod on our own which was great. It was very quiet and a lot of pods were empty. My kids enjoyed the views and we had fun pointing out the various buildings. Afterwards we wandered through the rainforest area under the flyer which was worth a look.",,,
,,too slow for my liking,3,,"The Flyer is too slow for my liking. While the view might be great on a clear date, it was hazy skies when we visited the place. The visibility was poor and it was not worth the money",,,
,,Views and more views,4,,Its not everyone's cup of tea but for me its well worth the admission fee. Especially at night the views are magnficent and the huge slow moving wheel gives you plenty of time to take them in. Photography can be tricky - press the lens against the window.,,,
,,"Great views, but too pricey",3,,"I find it hard to see how this was worth the ticket price. However, I still give it three stars because it is a Singaporean icon and it provides a terrific view of the city. I just wish that the ticket was more affordable.",,,
,,Ride at night to enjoy the lights,4,,"Of course daytime brings a great view, but the lights are so beautiful at night, especially of the Gardens by the Bay, bridges, etc",,,
,,Another 'wheel',1,,"Built during the world frenzy of cities needing to build a wheel of some sort, this is no poor effort!
Before the 'flying boat' was built next door, the Flyer offered unsurpassed views of Singapore and the harbour, albeit at a steep price! The price remains, but better views can be found elsewhere.
If you're into the wheels of the world, you should try this one though.",,,
,,"Go ""flying"" at night",3,,"I went on the Singapore Flyer ferris wheel while I was in town and thought it would be a fun experience. Well I guess it was my mistake for going during the day. I could barely see the city and the skyline because of all the haze. The sky doesn't get clear until after sunset, which I learned later. Also, it was pretty expensive for my tastes, around $25 USD for 20 minute ride. I did get some decent views of the marina but everything else was hazy. I'm NOT saying the experience or the Singapore Flyer was BAD, it was more my mistake for going during the day, I guess. So my advice and review is, go after sunset and you will enjoy the city lights from the skyline and the skyscrapers. DON'T waste your time during the day like I did.",,,
,,"If you are a tourist, then go for it !",5,,"Hey, why not ? Its the worlds highest and has great views . If you do go, take a taxi or get off at the right subway stop otherwise its a hike and a half if you get off at the Marina Sands Mall. (read: bring lots of water and very comfortable walking shoes)",,,
,,A romantic night on Singapore Flyer,5,,"After having a delicious dinner in No sign board, we took a walk to the Singapore Flyer. We go on the Flyer every time we visit Singapore because we can enjoy the fantastic view of the city. It was great to share the beautiful night view with my family, the city center's bright lights and interesting structures doting the landscape. We enjoyed the silence of the night and the sky full of stars. As much as the day view is great, in my perspective, you should definitely go at night, as there is less people and the view is more amazing.",,,
,,Champagne and View!,5,,"My husband and I opted for the champagne option. But before we could enter the flyer we were escorted to a bar with an awesome view of the river.

We got our own pod and a glass of champagne! We had a blast just taking tons of photos with each other and the amazing views, and not to mention dancing since they played some awesome music.

I highly suggest choosing any option that doesn't require sharing a pod with anyone other than the people you're going with.",,,
,,Amazing views!!,5,,"Highly recommendable if height is not an issue!! Despite the price it is worthy, specially at night, when the whole Marina bay can be seen",,,
,,Fun,4,,Exiting ride! Before the ride children were scared but as the ride proceed fear turn into fun and joy.,,,
,,Stunning views,5,,"It was once in a lifetime opportunity for me. It was beautiful. Should prefer going on the evening time, and be little smart so that you can get day + night view, as flying time is only 20 minutes.",,,
,,SGD 33 for a 20 minute ride.. ... hmmm...,4,,"Considering you can see the same view from any of the high rises around the Flyer, I am not sure if spending 33 SGD for that ride was value for money. But, its a tick in the box. 165 meters above ground and 360 deg view. Why not? If you have time to spare.",,,
,,Fly High SIngapore,5,,A great ride to view the city and get a glimpse of what and where you want to explore next. Reasonably priced for an absolutely well maintained attraction. Hop on-hop off bus will get you there and there are many restaurants on site. Fly high Singapore!,,,
,,The view is amazing,5,,"Very comfortable and wide compartment, you will overlook most of the area around the the flyer with a breathtaking view of the harbor, city, and Singapore architecture. The round only takes about 30 minutes.",,,
,,Nice ride,5,,"Perfect for couple. We went there during day time due to time constraint. Not crowded. If you go book the dinner. Anyway there are hawker food stalls down stair for food, good ride, stays on top for while to you can capture the city. MUST Visit if you are couple or family. Lil expensive, hey but you are in singapore.",,,
,,Good to do once,3,,"We had taken the ride on the Singapore Flyer during night. The view was good, perhaps great, but nothing spectacular. Maybe, having done London Eye, not having too many landmarks around was a dampener. Nevertheless, taking a ride on Singapore flyer will be a touristy thing to do.
We traveled by MRT and then 500-700 m walk there-on.",,,
,,Nice way to check out the sights,4,,"Did this on the our fist day to get a good view of the city. Wasn't busy at all, in fact the person coming off when we went on had a capsule to herself. Great some great 360 views of the city, you can also see down to the F1 circuit. Good value, pretty much exactly what you would expect from a observation wheel!",,,
,,Lively,5,,Clean and safe. Good services althougt price is little expensive. But that's what u have to accept when travelling to Singapore. It's expensive country in any cases.,,,
,,Panoramic view,5,,"The giant ferris wheel of Singapore which offers excellent views of the city.
Entrance fees of 33$ pp was paid.
The staff is very helpful for everyone.
The speed is so slow and smooth you hardly feel a thing as you move upwards.
The capsule is spacious and cool.
Must visit attraction in Singapore",,,
,,Nice experience to see Singapore from top,4,,260 m flyer with air conditioned cabins . Also you can book private cabins and have food there! It was my second time to ride flyer . Thicket is 33 and it works until 10:00 pm,,,
,,Stunning Views at night,5,,"Stunning at night, wonderful views over the city with the lights shining and the atmosphere buzzing. Great views to landmarks like the Gardens by the Bay, and the Merlion. Great value, plenty of time to take some photos and enjoy the view, yet not so long that you become bored, which was excellent. The night views are absolutely spectacular. Definitely worth it!",,,
,,360 degree view,4,,"Try getting up late afternoon when the queue is nil. Ride takes about half hour, if you are lucky you will get the whole capsule to yourself and party. Walk around the capsule to enjoy the whole view of Singapore. About 10 minutes walk from the Promenade mrt.",,,
,,Not for the Faint of Heart,4,,"Great views of downtown Singapore, the Harbour area, the city skyline.Should do it at night. Not cheap but worth it. Takes about 40 minutes to go around",,,
,,Great views of the city.,5,,"We went early in the morning, as soon as it opened. We got a car to ourselves. It was a real treat seeing all parts of the city from high up -- great views!",,,
,,Nice..,4,,"It is very nice and sophisticated, clean and well managed. The process of entering the place is very well organized. The flyer it self is high enough to see Malaysia and the movement is very slow so you can enjoy the ride without any dizziness or height fear.",,,
,,Not to be missed,5,,"Being afraid of heights I was extremely nervous but this is a great experience, feels very safe, is very slow and the views are out of this world.",,,
,,Wow wow wow,5,,We recently visited Singapore with friends and the Singapore Flyer was on our list ... we went on Easter Monday night so it was quiet and were lucky to have the entire capsule to ourselves for a 4 course meal with our own butler and pre flight drinks in the VIP lounge ... our experience for the 4 of us with wine was about $800,,,
,,The best bird eye view in Singapore,5,,This is the best Flyer in ASEAN that you will not lost your memory during the time that you are stayed on the flyer. the best experience that you will received from this Singapre Flyer is the best photo that you will take more and more photos so just recommend the must!!,,,
,,360,4,,This is a very good way to enjoy seeing Singapore.The ride is amazing.A very smooth ride.A good ride for family and friends.,,,
,,Singapore flyer city view,5,,Singapore flyer is nice to see complete city view from from top of the city. Ticket cost was 33 Singapore Dollar per person which is quiet expensive for flyer.,,,
,,once & it's enough,3,,romantic? that's if a 30 min ride with a brief 3 min at the peak is considered for you. and in a box filled w at least 1 to 3 other groups of people.,,,
,,Great views,4,,"Visited here on a weekday afternoon. Got the whole pod to ourselves, no queues. The ride takes thirty minutes, weather was a bit cloudy but we still got some great views. Would recommend this but it is a bit pricey. If you are going by public transport it's quite a trek from the Mrt station.",,,
,,Singapore view from top,4,,"Good one time visit. Should start ride during afternoon just before sunset, so that some part of the ride captures night view as well!",,,
,,Excellent!,5,,Every time I go Singapore I see this Marry Go Round. But never chance to check. This year with one of my colleagues went there. To see around the see and Singapore (as much as your eyes can see) it is excellent trip. I enjoyed much. Will visit with my family there soon.,,,
,,Great place to look over Singapore,5,,"This was a great place to see lots of Singapore and the harbour, it was easy and comfortable. Loved it.",,,
,,Great view,5,,"A lot of fun, gives you a good amount of time to take in the sights and take photos. It's easiest to take the bus there as its not on the MRT line",,,
,,Visit to the Flyer my birthday gift to the family,4,,It takes about 30 minutes to revolve fully. Although the city looks awesome from the highest point the other buildings which are either of the same height or taller than same block a perfect view. The authorities must look into one aspect especially when you are boarding and getting out since the flyer does not stop. Although the speed is slow disabled persons and children have a sense of anxiety and fear.,,,
,,Flyer,5,,Superb experience @flyer Amazing awesome This place is a heart of singapore !! Must visit guyz馃槑 We enjoyed a lot at flyer馃殸馃殸,,,
,,Wonderful views and great experience,5,,"I went early morning whilst it was quiet. The walk up to the centre is impressive as the view of Marina Bay along the promenade area is good. The decor inside is lush green and water features. A quick ticket purchase and I went to the line. Very professionally organised and I truly appreciated being asked if I was by myself and would I like a car to myself. The ride itself is relaxed and the slow change in perspective allows time for the ""perfect"" photo. Truly a great experience that I will come back to.",,,
,,Worth a visit,3,,"As an icon of Singapore, it's worth a visit. However, the price is a little high. Also, the complex could be interesting for any travelers.",,,
,,Good experience,4,,"If you are in Singapore then you need to do the flyer it is a great view of the city and worthwhile, we did it at night so the lights were spectacular",,,
,,Birdseye View,5,,"Singapore Flyer
Take the MRT to Promenade 鈥?take exit A cross the road and follow your nose! Follow the eventual signs to the Flyer. Enjoy a bird鈥檚 eye view of Marina Bay and Little India, as you travel 540 feet up in one of the 28 capsules on the revolving wheel.",,,
,,Expensive,3,,Some people might think its money down the drain. Quite an expensive affair and its barely a half an hour ride.,,,
,,Poor flyer,2,,It is absolutely unnecessary to keep this flyer in a beautiful city of Singapore. Who has the time and inclination to go to a flyer ? There are many other good activities to be done in Singapore,,,
,,What is the big deal...,3,,"It was expensive and it went around in 20mins.... Big deal....and not the most easiest place to get to...admittedly I went just after the Grand Prix.

You want to see Singapore from a great height there are better places like level 33 and Marina Bay Sand.",,,
,,Dr,4,,"It is interesting and yes you do get a good view of what I'd around Singapore. The brochure indicated that you could see Johore on a good day but we didn't manage to do that as it was rather cloudy when we went.
I am not sure you need to do skypark as well as the flyer as they are close by and you see a similar view.
My opinion is that you only need to go to one or the other for the views but then again some might want to do the visitor thing and go to both.",,,
,,Marvellous views,5,,"If there isn't a queue, you tend to think you are lost before you actually reach the 'wheel' as there are things to look at en route. Slow and smooth ride with great views. Tip: don't bother using your camera till you are nearly at the top or you will end up with so many pics the same and the videos can be too long and boring.",,,
,,Landmark,5,,"We were so lucky to ride on the car at about 7:00p.m. so that we could see the views before and after sunset. We could see the Garden by the Bay, the Art Science Museum and other landmarks. 30-minute per ride is quite sufficient to take photos from different angles. It moves slowly and would not make you feel uncomfortable.",,,
,,We loved it!!,5,,My 8 year old usually hates big wheels but she wanted to go on it because it was enclosed. She absolutely loved this one. Would definitely recommend.,,,
,,Memorable and stunning,5,,"This was my favourite thing to do in Singapore.

My wife and I recently rode the flyer on the first Saturday night of March at about 8:30pm. There was the smallest of queues and we shared our pod with a small group of another 4 passengers.

The best views are experienced at the highest point and when returning back down. as the wheel spins very slowly you're able to increase the time of your camera's exposure enabling you to capture the beautifully lit city below. There was plenty of time to take pictures as the wheel took half an hour to fully rotate.

Loved it!",,,
,,Worth a visit.,5,,I would compare this attraction to the London eye. But if you time it right you can watch the light show both in the gardens and in the bay.,,,
,,Best view of Singapore in the evening.,4,,Had the opportunity to dine on the Flyer one evening recently. Met in the Flyer Lounge where our drinks were taken on board our capsule for a memorable dining experience overlooking Singapore at night. Food was served by well trained staff and even the chef came on board to see if we were happy. Slight mix up on drinks but was quickly rectified. Dinner is served over 2 revolutions of the wheel and 4 courses served.,,,
,,Magnificent view from Singapore Flyer,4,,"It's one of those not to be missed for an amazing view of Singapore. With my phobia of heights, I managed to 'overcome' it in exchange for the view. It's really a breathtaking to be up there. It can be quite engaging for the kids as we highlighted the prominent places they are aware of. When the kids were running and moving around the cabin, I could feel my goose pimples during these movements within the cabin. I hope the flyer adheres to the safety standards with regular maintenance for the benefits of all their customers.

Although the view is magnificent, I feel the cost of entry are rather expensive, so do look out for promotions if any.",,,
,,An experience,5,,As im not good with heights I wasn't sure about this but did it anyway and WOW what an experience . wonderful views of Singapore.All round a great journey im glad I did it.,,,
,,A Delight,5,,"The pods are supposed to hold up to 28 people. I'd say ten adults would be just about enough. For that reason, don't go on the weekend. It's nice by day. Outstanding by night.",,,
,,See Singapore from the air,5,,Well worth a visit. The Hop on Hop off bus stops here and you can get a connecting bus to Sentosa here. It isn't expensive and there are little cafes around the bus for drink etc.,,,
,,Great views of the city,4,,We went at sunset so watched day turn to night across the city. Well organised and great city views. We captured some beautiful photos too.,,,
,,Not Amusing,3,,"Although the idea and concept is good and you get a very good view of Singapore Bay especially in the night, but it can be avoided looking at the cost per person. Its a 30 minute ride and you get a good view of the Bay and nearby places.",,,
,,great view from here,4,,"it is an iconic place in SG. u should try it. at night it gives a very bright look. however be prepared to pay lot, its expensive too.",,,
,,Spectacular views,5,,"This is a great attraction to see all of Singapore views. We had the whole pod to ourselves which was very nice. The staff were very friendly and it is very clean inside. Don't miss this if you go to Singapore for a holiday, great price $33 each",,,
,,Dhay&Avi,5,,Singapore flyer amazing views at night also close to marina bay sands hotel stunning night view of the super trees n helix bridge,,,
,,Flyer city view,4,,"If you don't have another way to get high up for a view across the city then this is recommended. The panorama of the bay and all the ships to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, and to the city itself is fantastic.",,,
,,Visually fantastic at night but no guide,3,,"The view was amazing, but it could have done well with a tour guide or an audio presentation to tell us more facts about buildings and landmarks. The only audio we heard was when we were at the highest point of the ride. For the night view it might be necessary to have a light cardigan as the air conditioning can get a little cold especially when at the highest point. There's also an option to have dinner in one of the carriages but we didn't try this time. A bit overpriced without a tour guide. There is also a bag check before you get on the ride. Plus an option to have your picture taken but this was very expensive. Otherwise the views are amazing, especially at night",,,
,,Average,3,,"It could be a novelty for some people, but I honestly thought it to be pretty average and a bit expensive. Do try to catch the sunset views which amps up the experience. Recommended more for families with kids.",,,
,,Lifetime Experience,5,,Beautiful view. Highest flyer in world as told by guide. You can see three countries at the same time from highest point. Few people are allowed in one coach which give you space to enjoy the ride. Very slow moving ride makes easier for people who are afraid of rides. Special announcement by loudspeaker exclusively for each coach makes easier to understand the ride. Definitely go for it.,,,
,,Fantastic Views,5,,"This is such a Good Attraction to get your Barrings in Singapore and the Views are just Amazing.

It is best to do this activity once you arrive and you will really understand the Layout of the City.

We all loved it and think it is a MUST.",,,
,,Definitely Worth A Try,5,,"Best time to visit in the evening a couple of minutes before sunset.

You get to see the Singapore skyline during the day and enjoy the night scene when it turns dark.

Worth paying to try at least once. In fact this is our second time.",,,
,,Atleast once!,5,,"I would recommend anyone to do this once, see the F-1 track and almost every important places in Singapore :)",,,
,,Giant wheel,4,,gives you the birds eye view of the city. It has its own charm to enjoy the ride during the day or in the evening. best time is to see the sunset as one can enjoy both in one go.,,,
,,Great Views at Night,4,,We did this in the early evening...provides great views of the city in a very comfortable environment.,,,
,,View view view,4,,Perfect view from flyer. A must visit place when in singapore. 33 sgd is worth and enjoyed the view. Speed is slow and also old aged people can be there. Approx 30 mins ride and worth it,,,
,,Great spot to see the city view,4,,"I had high expectation for Singapore flyer but unfortunately it's quite cloudy day, I recommend you go at night time instead, it could be more beautiful. It's great activities to do after you had a long walking along Marina Bay. The price is quite reasonable and it's so organize. Not too long queues and you can see view everywhere in the box.",,,
,,Kind of okay,3,,"This is one of the major attractions in Singapore. However, major in the sense of it is look. It is very attractive considering its huge structure, the lightings in the night etc. But I did not find anything interesting aboard it. Costs your S$33 per head. The duration is exaclty 30 mins for one revolution. It moves so slow that you might fall asleep inside. Yes the views are incredible from its top, but that you would get from any tall hotel buildings. So if your hotel is a super tall structure, then you may skip this and use that dollar for something worth.",,,
,,"Fly high, see Entire Singapore",5,,"The air-conditioned flyer ( the ferris wheel) of Singapore is a great comfort in the tropical weather. We reached there in late afternoon and got a cabin for ourselves and set soaring the heights. Beautiful views all around.....gardens by the bay..marina bay sands hotel...merlion...helix bridge...downtown sky scrapers.
It is a thrilling experience and is "" Paisa vasool"" in Indian terminology.",,,
,,Amazing 360 degree of Singapore,5,,"Amazing ride nothing more to say , really a 360 degree view of Singapore. High light part is safety and the compartment is also more spacious which is giving a comfort mood . We will never come to know that the wheel is rotating",,,
,,View from top,4,,Make sure you go on a clear day as its haze in Singapore. Good for clicking photos.tickets as usual in Singapore are costly.u can take a meal also while viewing the beauty below,,,
,,The wonderful singapore flyer,5,,"We were given this trip as a Christmas present. We had a pod all to ourselves complete with a gin sling each. The views over Singapore and the boats out in the South China sea were spectacular, we didn't want it to end, a really wonderful 1/2 hour",,,
,,Private Pod,5,,We booked a champagne capsule for a special occasion. It was great! Views are amazing. Staff were friendly and extremely professional.,,,
,,Biggest ferris wheel ever -- and so slow!,5,,"It is gigantic and overlooks Marina Bay with its museums and shopping and water activities. And its cycle is 30 minutes, so no need to fear motion sickness. Up and up means more and more of the wonders that technology turned Singapore into.",,,
,,Always delightful,5,,Delightful 40 minute rotation of the wheel with plenty of magnificent views. Nice way to escape the Singapore heat in a/c comfort.,,,
,,Comfortable ride and great views,5,,"Arrived here at 8.30am and there was no queue. We had a gondola all to ourselves (just 2 of us), which was awesome. We were only in Singapore for a day as we were on a cruise ship, so this was our first stop, just to get a general overview of the sights of Singapore, It was a slow ride, and the gondola was huge. There was a seat in the middle, but we spent the whole time walking around. We took some amazing photographs from in there, and perfectly clear even though they were taken through the glass windows. The views were amazing, and I'm so glad we did this!",,,
,,Great attraction,4,,It was such a shame we had such terrible smog at the time as this is a fantastic experience. The kids absolutely loved it and were so disappointed when it was over. Would love to do it again with a clear sky or at night.,,,
,,Wonderful!,5,,"We went there in the afternoon. Not much waiting time, and amazing view of Singapore. Would recommend to anybody.",,,
,,View of Singapore,4,,"Excellent views of the city on flyer, nice slow pace to allow for all the views. Good value worth a visit. Combine with the hop on hop off bus to get there easily and see all the other places of interest.",,,
,,Great View,4,,"Both my wife & I enjoyed the view from the peak of the Flyer, takes approx 30'minutes for one rotation. Flyer capsule is all glass & allows for excellent viewing from all corners, thankfully it's air conditioned & worth a visit to overlook Singapore from another perspective.",,,
,,Watch Sunrise,3,,This is a good spot for early morning or late evening jogging. Also a good spot for watching or photographing Sunrise. You can also have a good view of the city landscape,,,
,,Great views,4,,Just a brilliant way of seeing the skyline in Singapore. We did it at night and the illumination across the city was awesome with a good view of the Gardens by the Bay as a bonus.,,,
,,"Incredible views of the skyline, Gardens, and the harbor.",5,,"Relaxing views in both directions as going up favors one side of the island and going down faces the other. At the apex, you are above most buildings in downtown and the views of Marina Bay Sands and the Gardens by the Bay are amazing. Excellent way to see the city from above",,,
,,Average,3,,Very attractive from distance but nothing new. one can have a clear view of singapore city from the flyer,,,
,,Unparalleled views,5,,"Here, you will get some of the best views of Singapore.

You don't have to wait very long to board. There is restaurants all around with both Asian and Western cuisines.",,,
,,View Singapore from a Rotating Wheel,3,,Visited the Flyer for the hype told by friends and relatives and an eagerness to ride it as I watched it every day while commuting to my office. Finally went for a ride. The ride takes 30 minutes to complete and is moves slowly. Good attraction.,,,
,,Worth a ride.,4,,"We did this ride in the evening. It was $33 each and a good 40 minutes. I am glad we did it and worth doing. Spectacular views of the city. Airconditioned carriage, clean and spacious enough.",,,
,,Worth the money,5,,"This in our opinion is a must when visiting Singapore! It cost $60 for two and was well worth the money. Comfortable, air conditioned and safe with xray and metal detector scanned security before entering this ride which unfortunately is a must with the times we are in now. Beautiful views of Singapore in comfort",,,
,,Enjoyable & relaxing,4,,We enjoyed going on The Singapore Flyer having been on the London Eye. Good views of the city & plenty of opportunities to take photos from different angles. We were still looking upwards at the Sky Park at the Marina Bay Sands though - so we had to go on that too!,,,
,,The biggest Wheel of them all.,5,,"I've been on the Three big Wheels now. It has an amazing view all around Singapore. Preferred meals at Marina Bay for a better choice. The view is worth it,",,,
,,Better views elsewhere,3,,"Not worth the money as tall buildings block view. As a local I have to pay more than a tourist. Some other places like Marina Bay Sands Sky Park offer better views, others are free access to rooftop views.",,,
,,Flyer to see the sights & lights,5,,We went on the flyer to see all the sights and all the lights. It was a memorable thing to do. Recommend it!,,,
,,Great Experience,5,,Had been here when I was in Singapore for my vacations. You can actually see the whole singapore when on top of that wheel,,,
,,fantastic views,4,,It is recommended to visit around 6.30pm and above so you are able to enjoy the dusk and lights of Singapore. Besides it will not be so hot.,,,
,,Nice,5,,It's nice I can see view it's cool but quite far from MRT for me. After this I can walk to the bridge to marina bay.,,,
,,Great view..,4,,"Visited singapore zoo around sunset time.. Wa Sable to enjoy great view of sunset and night sky..
One of the tallest ferris wheel in world takes about 30 mins to complete revolution.
Best views when cable car on top and on decent. Formula one stand below..
Due to rain.. Difficult to obtain pics due to water droplets on.. glass.

They take your picture when going up.. It's costly..",,,
,,A 15min slow ride if you have time.,3,,It a super slow ride for you to slowly enjoy the view at marina area. Best to take the ride at night. not too hot.,,,
,,See the skyline and city from the top,4,,"The queue is long during tourist season, as a local, we choose a weekday and the best time to take the ride is just about dusk, so come at around 6 to 6.30 to get the best timing and cabin. The cabin size is about a bus size, no toilet, so please empty your bowels or bring your own drinks.
The ride take about 30 to 40 mins, depending on if they stop for wheelchair bound visitor. But it's best you visit singapore and the surrounding area first, then you get to identify some landmark at the top, instead of just ""nice scenery"" feel. Romantic only if no one else share the cabin with you, else people will be moving around inside to take photos here and there.",,,
,,the best flyer ever,5,,"Went there twice, both in morning. The view was nice and touching. be sure to take a camera. has air-conditioner. can have a decent breakfast after getting off the flyer.",,,
,,Great view of the city.,5,,This was fantastic. $ 33 for 30 minutes which is enough time to see the whole city. Gives a great overview.,,,
,,Why?,1,,"If you want to see the skylights of Singapore, there are many ways to do it. You can enjoy the view With a cocktail drink at many cafes dotted around the Marina Bay. Why go to a flyer? Not only it is expensive, it is boring experience.",,,
,,Awesome - Must do,5,,Get a 360 degree view of Singapore. We did it in noon but i thing evenings would be more enjoyable. Would definitely like to do it again in the evenings / night when the lights are on.,,,
,,best sunset activity in Singapore,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is by far the best sunset activity in Singapore. you have the best view of the city, chance to take some breathtaking pictures, and if your a photo bug you will appreciate the perfect lighting and subtle changes in lighting that occur over the entire skyline.",,,
,,Great views of Singapore from different angle,5,,"I enjoyed the flyer, it offers nice views, there was no line anywhere and everything worked very well, fast entry and exit, fast security, etc. really liked the nearby food market on the ground level",,,
,,Singapore 360,5,,"Don't miss this flyer on your Singapore trip. On a clear sunny day, this flyer gives you a great 360 degree view of Singapore. If you are carrying a good pair of binoculars then you can ever see the Malaysian coast.",,,
,,Lovely experience,4,,We enjoyed 30-minute ride very much. We did not know that this is the tallest of the panoramic wheels in the world. There were no lines at the entrance. Admission is 33 sgd.,,,
,,To get the best view of Singapore skyline,3,,To have a best view of both day and night. Try to reach there by 05:00 PM. You will have both view of day and night.,,,
,,Beautiful view,4,,"The view from up there is really amazing. It's beautiful. As a couple's visit there were others in the cabin alongside us, not the most private or romantic of setting thou and we were just waiting for the round to finish. Would recommend to go with families and children. Moves really slow, gets abit of a drag eventually.",,,
,,Fun....but not worth the wait,3,,"The views when we visited were limited, but upon completion of the casino and botanical gardens...it's probably wonderful!",,,
,,Views are amazing,5,,"Taller than the London Eye and just as spectacular. The views across Singapore were stunning. We went early on in the morning and there were no queues at all. Just 6 in our pod and it was a very smooth, quiet ride. We had pre booked but you could have got a ticket on the day. Set in a pretty tropical garden. Several food outlets around perimeter. People are going up the Marina Bay Sands tower instead as no charge but you get a much better experience from the flyer.",,,
,,Must do for families,4,,The Singapore Flyer is one attraction where you get some amazing views of the city. The capsules are clean and spacious and easily accommodates about 20 people. I recommend you to visit Flyer during weekdays to avoid long queues and crowded capsules.,,,
,,Bird's eye view of Singapore,3,,"The flyer moves VERY slowly, so you don't really feel the movement. Not as scary as it looks. It is air-conditioned and there is a long bench inside each capsule, so it is comfortable. You get an excellent view of Singapore and out over the sea towards Indonesia. It is best to go on a clear day so that you can really see things well. There is a gift shop, a reflexology shop, various eateries. It is not an exciting venue, but does give a view of the city as a whole.",,,
,,A relaxing slow view of Singapore and beyond,4,,Singapore flyer doesn't work when there is thunder in the clouds so we couldn't go the day we planned but didn't want to miss it so we went some other day. As we had already visited the garden bay and flower dome we could relate the where and what we were seeing. Flyer is quite huge and moves slowly giving you almost 360 view. on one side you have the sea view and other side the city view. It was nice and sure one must visit for first timers.,,,
,,Great experience,4,,"I visited and after a long walk at marina bay, this was totally relaxing. Nice air condition plus enjoying the city view.",,,
,,Thrilling,4,,"You get very good aerial views of Singapore. As it was not very busy on the day we visited, we got the whole pod to our selves. Well worth a ride.",,,
,,Stunning Views,5,,"This was excellent, 100feet higher than the london eye and cheaper !!! Don't miss it...In the morning there can be long queues but I went about 11:30 and only had to wait about 10 minutes.",,,
,,Timed perfectly to see light shows at Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands,5,,We impulsively decided to go to the Singapore Flyer after 7:30pm on a Monday night. There was next to no queue (15 people in front of us) so we were on board by 7:50pm which meant we had prime viewing of the light shows at Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands. Highly recommend!,,,
,,1 round,5,,"Its a must go, really a different experience. Night is time where you see all of Singapore lit up. Enjoyed very moment.",,,
,,Wonderful Experience,5,,The total time taken for a revolution was around 40 minutes. It rotates non-stop. Can have nice view when you are on Top. Recommend to feel this experience for the Tourists.,,,
,,A Must!,5,,The Singapore flyer is iconic and worth the fare to see Singapore from a different perspective! We went at night and loved it. Great for kids!,,,
,,Great views,5,,"The singapore flyer is a good way to see the skyline of the city,being the second tallest I the world, not very busy in March, but would think later in the year that it would get packed.",,,
,,"Great view at sunset, but so are many hotels in the area",4,,"great experience. no queues, slow and comfortable ride. good for relaxation after a walk in the park on the other side of the river. We did not try food as it looked to touristic, but it might be good for a bite. not a must if you are on short visit.",,,
,,Not a bad spot,3,,The Flyer has definitely shown some improvements since the last I came so it is not a bad place to visit to have a nice relaxing weekend with the family as they have a variety of food for everyone.,,,
,,Great to see Singapore at night,5,,"Did this after dinner and turned up to buy a ticket at 9:45 pm on a weekend there was no que.

We had a gondola all to ourselves (there were 5 of us)

Breathtaking views of a breathtaking modern city. There is so much more you don't appreciate about the architecture of Singapore that you see from a higher level.

Two ten year old boys loved it and we're not bored at all.",,,
,,"""Loved it""",5,,My girlfriend and I had a great time riding the Flyer. We had a car all to ourselves and we took a lot of pictures. The price was good and the view of the city was excellent! Would recommend it to anyone going to Singapore.,,,
,,Great views on a clear day,5,,"We really enjoyed our trip. We were a little worried about the possible queues as it was a Saturday when we visited, however we walked straight on and only had to share with another couple which was good as we could take photos for each other.
The views of Singapore are fantastic form the flyer, we had an enjoyable ride.",,,
,,A Relaxing way to view Singapore,5,,Excellent attraction. Not cheap but worth it. Easy to reach from the MRT and close to the Gardens by the Bay so they make a good days combination visit,,,
,,Great at night,4,,"Any visit to Singapore requires a visit to the Flyer, the world's second-tallest observation wheel, for great city views both day and night. We caught it on a Wednesday around 8pm. Finding a ticket booth was pretty difficult, however. Additionally, unbeknownst to anyone in our long line at the solitary open booth, there was a sales desk immediately adjacent where tickets could be purchased as well.

Still, the views were worth the difficulty finding the tickets for it. The clear capsules allowed for excellent visibility of the cityscape, and we lucked into what appeared to be laser light show on the Science Building and Marina Bay Sands. The interior map is helpful, with English subtitles as well.",,,
,,Lovely view,5,,A memorable experience and a must do in Singapore! Overpriced a bit like many other attractions in Singapore but must say was well worth it. Best time is a little before sunset but do not go when it's dark !,,,
,,Can't be missed!,5,,Soaring high above Marina Bay this experience is not to be missed. The views are unparalleled. Breathtaking 40 minutes that acclimate you to the city spread out before you. Stunning view of the Marina Bay Sands building as well as the harbor.,,,
,,Great way to view the city,5,,The flyer is well worth a visit and provides a birds eye view of the city. it lasts 30mins and the photo opportunities are excellent. A must-do!,,,
,,Super cool experience!!,4,,"I visited Singapore flyer with my family and it was an awesome experience.You get beautiful views of the city and its a fun ride !! We went on a weekday and it wasn't much crowded,so we got a cabin for ourselves.The ride takes some 40minutes to finish and its indeed memorable!!",,,
,,Lovely leisurely time to see Singapore,5,,"Being a little afraid of heights, this wasn't on my To Do list for Singapore, but when the Hop On/Hop Off bus stopped here, it was a spur of the minute decision to just do it!!

So pleased that I did .. what a wonderful experience. I was lucky enough to share the cabin with only six other people so plenty of room to move around and also to take photos of me :-)

It takes around 45 mins and the time passed quickly taking in the 360-degree views.

Definitely recommend it.

One note was that the recorded message on the Hop On/Hop Off bus stated that a discount for ticket holders was available. I was informed that this ended at the beginning of March (I was there on the 10th).",,,
,,Good experience,4,,We went to flyer and the view is very good. It is good 30 minutes view of Singapore along the marina Bay. Garden by the bay is also very near to the flyer so if you want you can plan both together,,,
,,Stunning Views of Modern Singapore,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is worth every cent of the entrance fee. The ride is a slow circle with magnificent views of modern Singapore. I am not comfortable with heights, but the construction of the cars is so solid that the experience is more like flying than looking down from a great height. I can recommend this ride to all visitors to Singapore",,,
,,Birds eye View,4,,"Great to see how Singapore is set out, we enjoyed this as it was my first ""flyer/eye"" experience. Be prepared to stand for awhile if there is a que.",,,
,,A must do!,5,,The view and experience are a definite must. The flyer gives you plenty of time to see and discover so much about the city and helped us make some plans as to what we wanted to visit next. Very clean and safe. Able to move around in the car and take pictures.,,,
,,The Big Wheel,5,,"Spend 35 mins on the flyer to great a great view of Singapore. You can pick out places such as Clarke Quay, Boat Quay and Marina Bay Sands Skypark and many more. Well worth a visit.",,,
,,Good Visit,4,,"The attraction was great, and the various bits and pieces of information was great as it gave you an insight of the Singapore Flier.

We were lucky enough to get in a pod to ourselves, and the views are fantastic! The only issue I had would be that it was extremely slow - took 40 minutes just to get around it. Could also benefit from a tape being recorded telling you more about the different places you can see when in the Flier.

Overall I had a great time, but could have been a bit faster and could be more informative in the little pod.",,,
,,Great experience,4,,We bought tickets on the day but found out you could get it cheaper from agents or online later. The experience was great. You get to see the best of Singapore from on high.,,,
,,Beautiful Singapore under Your Feet,5,,"I have height phobia, however, taking Singapore Flyer was a great experience for someone like me. I enjoyed it tremendously...panoramic view of beautiful city. Though the queue to take the ride was long, it only took a short while of waiting for our turn. A must to visit for all travels.",,,
,,First Time Trying,4,,very breathaking experience. we can see all singapore area. but it will be beautiful if you take ride at night.,,,
,,Seeing Singapore,3,,"Night time viewing was cool. The lights were pretty and we were only other couple and 1more single person. So it was great that they didn't over crowd it. There was plenty of space to really absorb Singapore. The walkthrough which takes place prior to boarding was a bit of a nothing event.
Unfortunately, the staff who are in and around that complex are so unhelpful and unfriendly. I dislike leaving 'average' reviews but this was just that, average.",,,
,,Ride the flyer,5,,"This is a once and a life time ride. It takes about 45 minutes to go around but well worth it. The views are unbelievable and at night, well you just have to see it! A must see thing to do here!",,,
,,Great views,4,,We visited on a clear sunny days. I took lots of photos through the glass they came out great with no reflection problems. Our pod only had 6 of us.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"We went at 18:00 just when it was getting darker and the views were awesome ,it's an inexpensive tour and well worth doing we walked to it from the Pan Pacific Hotel 20-25 mins.",,,
,,"Great view, but overpriced.",3,,"ITS like most of the places in Singapore. Expensive, but worth doing. If you can mis 33 s$ for a 30 min ride. You'll Get a nice view in return",,,
,,great view,3,,"view from top is best. but no need to spend more as you can get same view from marina sands hotel, which is higher then flyer. but interesting to do it once. if you are in group, then you get whole flyer cabin to yourself. you can skip and save money and instead go to marina sands rooftop.",,,
,,Not for the faint hearted,5,,I dont do heights and should have never gone on this ride. In saying that though my family loved it and couldnt get enough photos. Could see for miles and takes half an hour to do a full turn.,,,
,,"Nice view, but super slow.",3,,"It lasts about 30 min. to finish it. Sure the view is nice from the top, but it is so, so, so slow to get back down after you have seen the view.",,,
,,"must try it , splendid view",4,,"what a breath taking view !! the seating cabins are very spacious and we watched it during day time and still we loved it. so am sure watching the Singapore skyline at sunset or after dark , will be amazing.
must visit this if you have time on hand.",,,
,,One of the Best Views of the Island on a clear day,4,,"Excellent views on a clear day - little or no queuing - not crowded, interesting museum fairly priced. Takes around 40 minutes - allow a couple of hours to see the exhibits in the museum. What more can I add?",,,
,,Amazing!!,5,,"Gobsmackingly WOW!!
Buy your ticket in the afternoon, as your ticket is valid up till 10pm that day (ticket booth is closed in the eve.) Then in the evening, go back and enjoy the fabulous choice of streetfood below the giant Ferris wheel before you get on board the pod. We had a pod completely to ourselves and the night time scenery is totally awesome!! Wait till you get to the VERY top before you start taking photos - so that the wheel structure doesn't blot the pics....but even the magnificent structure is photogenic!! Think of the London Eye then double the size and quadruple the viewing experience. The ride takes a wonderful 30 minutes.",,,
,,Nice view,3,,"It rotates quite slowly so you get plenty of time to see the area. It goes around only once, so take it all in.",,,
,,Very good experience,4,,It was very easy reach here by a metro.. Tickets were very easily available ... View from the Singapore flyer was amazing but it is still not as great as London eye..,,,
,,Beautiful views.,3,,I went on this attraction eight years ago when it first opened and feel that not much has happened their since. The views are great but the shops need a revamp. While there I tried the Chicken rice at the local restaurant and it was divine.,,,
,,Wow ... Best flyer in the world!,5,,"I've tried Hong Kong and London eye. This for me is the best. We were lucky we got the capsule all to ourselves and just had a splendid time looking at the beauty of Singapore. 30 mins of non stop taking photos, memories that will last a life time. Try it :-)",,,
,,Very Exciting and Possibly the largest wheel in world,5,,"we visited this in March 2015. Nominal ticket to board. It moves at a very low pace and takes half an hour to complete one revolution. View from the top is very beautiful.
Must take ride.",,,
,,""" What A View """,5,,"Amazing - the view is breathtaking.
Moves so slow you don't realise you are moving.
Take your camera for some great photos.
Easy to get on & off - suitable for wheelchairs.",,,
,,Really nice light up at night ... a true site to behold!!,4,,"Really nice light up at night ... a true site to behold!!

Walked around it one night on our trip in Singapore ... quite nice to see at night.",,,
,,Lovely,4,,"This was great.
You can look over the grand prix circuit and pitlane. You have superb views Marina Bay. Well worth a visit especially at grand prix time.",,,
,,Great Experience,4,,"Going on the Singapore Flyer was a great experience for me. I had a slight panic attack due to my fear of height once. But the slow speed and comfortable carriage reduced my fear considerably. Unfortunately, it still dissuaded me to enjoy the view from the glass walls. I remained seated the whole time. My husband and daughter, however, enjoyed the ride and views immensely.

Other than my fear, I would say this is a thoroughly enjoyable experience. We went at 8.30PM and there's no line at all.",,,
,,"After dark, reflections do spoil the view",5,,"We went late evening, about 9.30pm. No queues, but while the views were good, we were constantly aware of reflections of the flashing lights that illuminate the Flyer. They were intrusive. I have been on this ride several times, and I think you get the best experience during daytime or at dusk, no later.
You have to step on and off the car while it鈥檚 moving. The staff are well aware that this can be difficult for the elderly, and gave both of us help. However I don鈥檛 think it鈥檚 suitable for wheelchairs, as there鈥檚 a bit of a step when boarding. But do check with the staff if that鈥檚 a problem for you, as there may be a solution.
There are toilets after the pre-ride exhibition (but before the queue, if any) and when you leave the ride, and of course plenty of toilets in the Flyer building. The exhibition is moderately interesting, if you have time to look at it.
The Flyer is hard to reach by bus or MRT,The closest bus stop is Opposite Ritz Carlton on the road to Marina Bay Sands. in any case expect a 5 minute or longer walk. However there is a bus stop immediately outside when you want to leave (it鈥檚 the terminus, bus routes only start from it).
It鈥檚 a great experience, but you don鈥檛 get that long to enjoy the views. Even so, I always enjoy it.",,,
,,Spectacular views over Singapore.,5,,"Th is the tallest flyer in the world. Views are spectacular, particular towards the end of the day with clear sky and beautiful sunset. Plenty photo opportunities while in the air.",,,
,,Iconic place in Singapore,5,,"Being the largest observation wheel in the world for many years, unfortunatly now it losts it's title and popularity. But it is still on of the iconic places and greeting cards in Singapore.
Seating in comfortable and airconed capsule, It gives the amazing 360掳 view of the Singapore and strait.
Highly recommended to visit at least once",,,
,,Amazing city views,4,,Best way to see how big this city really is. Great for taking many pictures. It's air conditioned & takes a about half an hour to complete the full rotation.,,,
,,Holidays,5,,Very good experience lovely views all over Singapore. It is higher than the one in London. If you have a boarding pass it is worth taking with you as you get 10 percent reduction.,,,
,,Amazing views,5,,Great experience and exceptional views! This is a must see we we during the day however I think evening would be beautiful as well. These cars are huge so anyone afraid of confined areas will be okay.,,,
,,"Average, but interesting",3,,"This attraction in Singapore is interesting because it offers a bird's eye view of Singapore. You could see Marina Bay Sands, the F1 circuit, Gardens by the Bay, and a lot of vessels at sea. Nothing more. It's better to buy tickets online because you could go straight to the loading area upon arrival.",,,
,,One good ride,4,,"It is one of the better places to spend your money in Singapore. It is very well managed and the experience of flying in a glass capsule with a mesmerizing view around is breath taking. Since I have been in London Eye which is exactly same concept, so it was not that exciting but I would strongly recommend it to those who haven't been in one before.",,,
,,view singapore 360 but slow!,3,,if you want to see view around singapore suggest to use it! but you have to spend time with it 30 minute for one times and you have to pay money too. suggest to buy ticket at sea wheel it will be safe cost,,,
,,On a clear day you can see forever.,5,,It was not busy at 10am so we had a whole cabin by ourselves. What a wonderful way to see Singapore. We felt so good we brought all the pictures they took of us.,,,
,,Unbeleiveable,5,,"As a person hating heights why I stated we were going to go on the flyer is still a mystery. Even after paying the entry fee I was having doubts. Walking up to the flyer noticed that it is continually in motion getting on from the left and alighting on the right. Once aboard and rising the view around was fantastic. I had a wobble as we neared the apex and then was okay. Any regrets? non whatsoever, this is a must visit.",,,
,,Lifetime experience !!!,5,,"Truly a lifetime experience while we went there for the ride. We were five in number and I personally have experienced this ride that will be in my memory for lifetime.. Awesome view of the city, awesome technology and of course a mind blowing bird's eye view of the city. Thanks to the govt for an astonishing brilliant idea to give this opportunity to experience the scenic beauty of Singapore...",,,
,,Take your binoculars!,5,,"It's big, the views are outstanding but allow a couple of hours for the whole experience, camera, binoculars & water are all necessary",,,
,,Must visit,5,,"This one is claimed to be the largest in the world. One round takes about 40 minutes. If you manage to visit and ride around sunset then you can enjoy city in daylight as well as night.

You can enjoy local street food of good quality at cheap rate. Thus, you can combine the ride with dinner and enjoy sumptuous Singapore cuisine.

This offers magnificent view of Singapore. Must visit.",,,
,,Fabulous views,4,,Visited the Singapore Flyer for a flight recently whilst on holiday. Super experience with very good views of Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay. Slightly surprised at how quiet it was when we visited - had a gondola to ourselves. Very worthwhile and would recommend.,,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,"On a clear weather one can see Malaysia (johor bahru) at one end and Indonesia on the other end. Fantastic! Isn't it? Well managed experience. Though many tourists visit Flyer, there is less waiting time.",,,
,,average,3,,"I did flyer in feb around 12 pm ,i dont like it much as it goes very very slow view is also so so ,maybe in night is good but again speed could have been one point where they can improve",,,
,,Second Tallest flyer of the world after the london eye.,4,,We were six pax enjoyed the flyer on 6th march 2016.. very much slow.. it took 30 minutes to reach the floor.. 550 mtrs hight.. 360 degree view of singapore city and gardens by the bay... little costly.. one suggestion: if you are staying in Marina bay sands... no need to give this a try... as Marina bay has itself a superb view of all singapore city from sky deck as well infinity pool(pool only for guest of the hotel),,,
,,great way to sight see,4,,"very enjoyable,a must if you are visiting singapore a nice slow ride so you have heaps of time to take in the sights.we came at a good time of the year (march) so it wasn't busy and there was a lot of space to move around",,,
,,Peaceful views of the City,5,,"One rotation takes about 30 minutes so relax in the peaceful pod and enjoy the views, which are quite stunning. It's well located so easy to get too. We walked over the helical bridge from the Cloud Forest in few minutes, which was a pleasure in itself. There was no waiting time and as is everything in Singapore, very well maintained and smooth running. It looks great at night too.",,,
,,Not that great,4,,It was worth one time visit only . We entered the flyer around 7.00 pm which is the best time to be there as one can enjoy both the sunset as well as Singapore in lights. View from flyer was great,,,
,,A bit of a walk aside from taking a taxi.,3,,"A bit of a walk if you decide not to take the taxi from the nearest MRT. Signs are not really clear, it took us several times to go around, up and down before we find the ticket booth. A nice 360 view of the city is nice. But that was just it for 33SGD per person.",,,
,,Advanced marry go round,5,,It is a advanced marry go round - airconditioned with advance technology. U get a good view of some of the places of singapore. Nothing great.,,,
,,Good city view,4,,"Classic view of the city. Very touristic, because it offers a nice view of the city, especially in the evening",,,
,,Supper Flyer,5,,Flyer is a giant Ferris wheel in Singapore. It is quite slow at first sight. But its Really Very much Amazing.n Superrrb.,,,
,,Never thought it was sooooo great,5,,"""Not for me"", I always thought..until I went onto the Singapore Flyer for a business trip. It's a great way to have unrivalled views over the city in a tranquil and luxurious way. The sunset, a glass of champagne and some live music made it a memorable experience.",,,
,,Eye to singapore,4,,This is a nice point to enjoy the complete view of Singapore from the height.Amazing view of islands and sky scrapper in the city.,,,
,,Excellent all in one skyhigh tour!,4,,"at 28SGD per person, this 30 min ride is full of beautiful sights and visuals. it gives a birds eye view of magnificent marina bay and Singapore business district and the city. you can see the formula one pits.
Its worth the money spent and both day time and night time view",,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"A must-do attraction in Singapore. Amazing views of a fantastic city. Great photos can be taken of the skyscrapers, Marina Sands and parts of the Formula 1 circuit. The Flyer just looks great also.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Bigger than the London Eye, the Flyer offers wonderful views of Singapore for a price in line with similar attractions in other cities. We were lucky to join when not busy & got a pod to ourselves. Got some great pictures. Thoroughly enjoyable.",,,
,,Best view in the city,4,,Enjoy a leisurely ride in the flyer. Get the best view of the Singapore skyline. Do it in the evenings only.,,,
,,Champagne Ride in Private Car,5,,"My partner and I purchased tickets for the champagne ride on the flyer. It was wonderful! We ended up with a private car. Our ride was in the late afternoon at about 4 pm. The champagne and chocolates were great and having a private car really made the experience. A word of caution though, I'm not sure if we would've felt the same if we hadn't had that unexpected perk, since the price is quite a bit higher for the champagne ride.",,,
,,Breathtaking View,5,,Must see attraction in Singapore. Amazing view of islands and sky scrapper in the city. Decently priced.,,,
,,Ultimate Flyer Experience,5,,It was our first tourist spot. The scenic beauty is amazing. There are many restaurants and street style spots also. Must visit for all tourists.,,,
,,super value for money,5,,visited during the week as no queues. even got our own capsule. stunning views of the city during the day. would be even more impressive in the evening when light show is on. below flyer is hawkers food which is true traditional food great quality and cheap.,,,
,,to get the best view of singapore,5,,go around 7.00 - 8.00 pm for the nice view of singapore....u can see sunset at your west side and is amazing .,,,
,,Awesome,5,,"I am not one for heights, but this trip is unmissable! The flyer takes approximately 30 minutes and goes so slowly you do not realise you are moving and by the time you reach the top the views are so breathtaking you forget how high you are (at least I did) .definitely worth the 33dollars per person (approx 16拢 at today's rates)",,,
,,Great view,5,,"The best time to visit is during night when city is in lights. We walked there from Marina Bay.
The price 33$ might be too high for some but for us it was worth it and we had the condula all for ourselves, just the two of us.",,,
,,I enjoyed the ride,5,,Very good concept. one more angle to view the scenic Marina Bay. Very well built and maintained. Better to go in the evening or night time.,,,
,,Ok for one time !,4,,Visited Singapore Flyer. Ok for one time. Just to cover all tourist spots in Singapore. Must for first time travelers. Good view of complete Singapore in this slow yet fun filled ride. Go for it. Enjoy !!!!,,,
,,The Flayer--LIFE TIME EXPERIENCE,5,,"We were in Singapore from 10th to 13th February 2016 on a holiday. We were 6 families. On 11th February. we boarded Singapore Flayer. Some of our members were reluctant to board because of its rotation to a height of about 164 meters But once we were in, they had the last laugh. Experience of a life time.

The Singapore Flyer is a giant Ferris wheel in Singapore. Its a just coincidence that we were in the Flayer on 11th February 2016, when we were told that the Flayer carried its first paying passengers on 11 February 2008 but was opened to the public on 1 March 2008 and was officially opened on 15 April.2008.

The Flayer has 28 air-conditioned capsules, each able to accommodate 28 passengers As we were 12 members, we occupied a separate Capsule and enjoyed every minute of our stay inside the capsule. It was fantastic as we could see the entire City of Singapore from all angles and from all directions. We played, we laughted and enjoyed to the maximum extent.

Though the Flayer was moving, we never felt the rotation and we were so immersed in viewing the beautiful buildings and the beach No doubt, Its worth the money

This is much safe even for senior citizens as much care is taken in evolving the flayer and the capsule.",,,
,,"SF is not as good as SQ, but pretty fun",4,,"Along with the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, this is one of better ways to view Singapore from above, plus you get the fun of the motion, and the view of MBS itself! Evening flight is more impressive than day flight. Not easy to get to by public transport.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,3,,Must go on bright sunny day time or clear night. However the prices are bit high compare to the experience we get,,,
,,wonderful attraction and exceptionally fun for children,5,,this place is very exciting to children and enjoying high top view around Marina Bay. Feel safe and convenience with widely capsule. Night time would be great with light and laser from buildings surrounded.,,,
,,A Must!!,5,,"If you have done the London Eye or similar attractions in other cities you will like the Flyer. Great views of the ships anchored in the bay - Marina Bay Sands - Gardens by the Bay, etc. Worth the time and the money.",,,
,,Viewing point...Feris wheel,4,,"One of the better things to do,takes you high up its a 30 min ride goes really slow you will be able to see most of the singapore, On a clear day can also view till batam indonesia.One of the must do activity and it costs like SGD 35 and worth visiting once especially if you love to take pictures.BTW...you can have dinner arranged in the capsule probably costs around SGD 300 per person and there are couple of restaurants on second level,one indian restaurant by name of tandoor is a good one...ideal time to visit is probably 5-6pm.",,,
,,Superb for 33 S $,5,,Very good indeed and straight on unlike the monstrous queues in London. Sensational views and clearer than London. Good value. We used the 24 hrs hop on and hop off bus that took us all round the best sites in Singapore. This is from the Tourist main office in Orchard Road,,,
,,A must see,5,,"This was fun. What a view. We did this on our own and really enjoyed the views. If you want some beautiful skyline photos, this is it.",,,
,,Whole Singapore City Can Be Seen From The Top,5,,The Singapore Flyer Is One Of The Biggest High Flyer In The World..If Looks Awesome From Outside As Well As From Inside...Great View Of The Whole Singapore City..One Must Definitely Go If You Visit Singapore..,,,
,,Standing around in a circle for half an hour!,4,,"The Flyer is apparently the biggest one of it's kind in the world - and it's really impressive! It never stops - you even get on & off while it's moving (although it is slowly). Great views of Marina Bay, the Singapore CBD, the breath-taking Marina Bay Sands Hotel as well as out to sea. Well worth it for the fantastic photo's. Go just before sunset (around 1830) so get daytime & night-time views...",,,
,,Amazing View,5,,Exhilarating view. Had a great time viewing the modern landscape of Singapore. Recommended only if you have time to spare.,,,
,,Family Adventure,5,,Booked the Singapore Flyer before we arrived so we missed the queue. Great view of the city while the sun went down.,,,
,,Don't waste your money on Dinner,2,,"The view is fine, but the food was cafeteria quality. Also. the wine and champagne was extraordinarily over priced. We paid &150.00 for a bottle of Veuve Clicquot which you can buy at Binnys for under $60.00. They did not provide you with napkins for dinner. I had to use pocket tissue.
Also, to add insult to injury, the rotation was too short for dinner. You were rushed to finish dinner before the rotation was completed. This was by far the worst expensive dinning experience that I have ever had.",,,
,,If you can't go to London why not ride it here!,4,,The view was definitely worth the wait to reach the TOP of the flyer.The commentary gave good information for locals and tourist. The kids could not get enough of it and wanted another round.,,,
,,Night Time view,5,,"Excellent view of Bay, Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, Grand Prix Circuit and so much more. Well worth the cost to ride on the Flyer",,,
,,Fly over the city,5,,This ferris wheel can't be missed! It gives spectacular view of the Marina Bay! The whole ride is about 30 mins and moves so slow you don't feel anything! Only 10 people in a cabin it's really cozy and no one is blocking the view for a long time. You can go day or night you'll see a beautiful skyline. The queue moved fast so don't be afraid if a lot of people before you.,,,
,,so much to see from a totally different perspective,5,,Not particularly expensive but certainly worth the time. Looking at the city from this height is amazing,,,
,,Up up and away,5,,"This is a must! You get Singapore from a birdseye wiew! It is very well kept and feels nice, clean and safe. You get a good look of the harbour and the city!",,,
,,Best views of Singapore skyline,5,,Amazing breathtaking views of Singapore and sea. Please visit on clear sunny days. It takes 30 mins to complete the whole circle. Must visit if you are in Singapore.,,,
,,Champagne Flight,4,,Me and my fianc茅e got engaged a couple days before riding. We booked a champagne flight at night. When we got there to our delight we were the only ones to book the champagne flight so have to whole capsule to ourselves. Surreal experience especially as it normally cost 拢1000 to have your own. Stunning city scape views.,,,
,,Enjoy those 30 mins,5,,This is a good start for your trip in Singapore. It takes 30 minutes in the air and while in the capsule you can take pics and relax as you enjoy the view from the sky. Recommended if you have not been to The London eye.,,,
,,Beautiful yet horrific if you are afraid of heights,5,,"Oh My God it does go too high but once you are there the view is amazing.
After been to Singapore for 7 times I had to do it.
It is very safe so you don't be afraid unless if you are afraid of his",,,
,,Not Bad!,5,,"So I allowed myself to be convinced to go on the big Ferris Wheel one night. A bit too touristy for my liking generally, but I have to say it was good. Amazing views. Not sure what it would be like during the day, but a night ride was spectacular. Good value for money. Well worth doing. Oh good gift shop as you exit - quality items, not tool overpriced.",,,
,,Beautiful view of singapore,3,,"Kind of costly for a ride to see the city; but I'd still recommend it. We went in the morning, but I guess the night view is better :)",,,
,,It's a good experience,4,,...........it's a good experience ... only one time visit... it be good to book tickets from tourist agent ..................instead of booking online.....................................................,,,
,,Spectacular!,4,,"We booked our tickets online prior to arriving in Singapore to enjoy the (minimal) discount. Upon researching, we decided to time our embarkation nearer to sunset to enjoy the sun setting on the city. Unfortunately, we got up too early to experience the sunset! The view on the way up, on top and down did not disappoint! Gorgeous! There's no point in me describing what you can see up there as the view is well worth the price.

However, getting up was slightly tricky as the Flyer never stops. It moves really really slowly though so everybody is supposed to ""jump"" on when the capsule approaches the platform. Those with mobility issues should bear this in mind. Also, it's a no-no for those with fear of heights as the capsule is pretty much all glass.

The centre is quite nice to walk about while waiting to embark or after. It overlooks the starting grid and paddock area of the Singapore GP. Gardens by the Bay can also be seen from there.

After our trip up, we took a walk along the Helix bridge to Marina Bay Sands. It was a very nice walk! We really enjoyed it!",,,
,,Just another Paris Wheel,3,,"Long queues, one round took ages. Not really worth the money is my opinion. Spend a night in Marina Bay Sands Hotel and hang out at the terrace there instead or go for a brunch at the KuDeTa at Marina Bay Sands instead if view is what you are after.",,,
,,Magnificent view of the Lion City,5,,"Went to Singapore flyer last November. Not very expensive for me, but it was great. after entered the gate there's a introductory gallery on observation wheels around the world and the city-state of Singapore. The cabin is huge, clean and pleasant. The view from the cabin is magnificent, the higher the better (on the week prior news reported that the haze is persistent but it doesn't matter.) Besides all those major buildings in the town, I can see the Keppel port, as well as residential area of Mountbatten and Marine Parade. Explanatory signs in the cabin on attractions that can be seen from cabins were useful. There're food outlets in the mall underneath, some guidebooks I can bought at home said that the food is good also.",,,
,,great view,5,,"Me ,my wife and son visited Singarpore last week and decided to go on the the Singarpore flyer, it is a excellent way of taking in the sights around the marina and beyond, not in the least bit scarey, very gradual and calm and rock steady, bye the time you reach the highest point your used to height and views, although it's 30 metres bigger then the London eye you don't get that feeling , all in all a lovely way to spend 30 minutes, we did not book in advance and it cost for the 3 of us about 拢50 , worth it for the experience",,,
,,Great perspective on city,5,,Did this despite Husband fear of heights and got some great photos of city. recommend as must visit also.,,,
,,Awesome,4,,We had visited both Marina sand spark and Flyer. I preferred the flyer. The views were amazing. We took the ride during sunset. Awesome..lovely way to see Singapore skyline,,,
,,Great views of the city,5,,"Such a great experience taking a trip on the Flyer. Panoramic views of the gardens, marina with the boats going in and out - and right above the Grand Prix circuit. The wheel turns slowly to maximise viewing and photo opportunities - loved it",,,
,,Love it!,5,,"By riding MRT, we could get there easily, but me and my friend just try to walk from merlion park. It's soooo tiring that we could feel our leg is separate with our body but when we ride that flyer, all the tiredness suddenly dissapear. We feel so glad to enjoy singapore from above. Even it quite expensive, but we take it for granted.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,Wonderful experience.....looking at the top of sky ....entire Singapore city & the ocean....with my wife who was on the wheel-chair......very few places like this provide such a facility to a handicapped......I really admire the Government & the Organizers to be so much visitor friendly.......,,,
,,It was a great view,3,,"May be we made a mistake by going at night, it was a great view but almost all the photos are ruined because its a big glass box and cameras do not like glass. Im guessing it would have a greater view when f1 races are on. Since the whole track wraps around the place",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,"If visiting Singapore, this is a ""must do"" for any visitors. You will be rewarded with fantastic views of the city and its suburbs.",,,
,,A must do.,4,,"Arrived about 10.30 am on a Saturday, very short queue. Senior rate only for Singaporeans but got a discount by showing my Singapore airline boarding pass. Large capsules and not overcrowded. Glorious views of Marina bay and the skyline. It takes about 30 minutes to complete. I'm not too good with heights but this was fine. Next visit (I hope!) will do it by night.",,,
,,"Brilliant Views, friendly staff.",5,,Brilliant views and a good way to fully appreciate the vastness of the city. Slow enough to get good photographs. Went during darkness and seeing the bay and all surrounding it lit up was great. Was able to view the preparations for F1 too!,,,
,,Good view,4,,Good to do when first visit Singapore. Probably don't need to do both this and the sky deck viewing platform at Marina Bay. Sky deck thing goes higher than this.,,,
,,What a view!,5,,If you are ever in Singapore this is a must! Fantastic views all around this wonderful city. Billed as the highest in the world and we certainly wouldn't argue with that!,,,
,,A got to do,4,,A great way to see over Singapore. The cars were large and afforded comfort as well as the great views. Lots of other attractions at its base.,,,
,,A must see in Singapore,4,,Because of time we had to go on the Flyer during the day. I'm sure it is much better at night. It had a bit of an introductory story which took you through the building of the flyer. Very interesting plus it was air conditioned. It was fun and a must see in Singapore but it was a bit pricey. You can get a 10% discount if you show them your Singapore Airlines boarding pass. There are no signs and no one tells you this but I asked and got the discount.,,,
,,First time visitor,4,,A great way to see the city if you have never been here before. The wheel trip shows you both sides of Marina Bay.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer at Night,5,,The best time to ride the Singapore Flyer is at night time to enjoy the panoramic view of Singapore skyline. The skyline at night time is totally different from day time. Don't forget to bring your camera for the souvenir shots. It's worth the money and the time. It takes roughly an hour for the whole ride.,,,
,,An experience full of amaze,5,,Singapore flyer...An amazing experience full with joy and enthusiasm for all people of different interests...May anyone be feared by height but this flyer takes it all out!!,,,
,,Mustdo this and go early to avoid queues.,5,,"Arrived by taxi at 10am on a Tuesday - no queues - discount because we travelled by Singapore Airlines (SilkAir also counts). Brilliant views, must do this!",,,
,,Best place to see the whole city,5,,"First experience and it's awesome Will surely comeback if I am in Singapore and reccommended to my friend or family Price is reasonable. Tube is large and clean. The staffs are friendly and informative. Would like to try the dinner package, I wish",,,
,,Good experience !!,4,,"Flyer gives a great view of the Marina Bay, it takes approx 30 mins for the entire round trip to complete. There are seats there for sitting and you can click pictures all the time while it goes round.
Visiting in the evening would be more better in my personal opinion.
Worth a visit definitely !!",,,
,,Dinner on the Flyer,5,,"So this is the big ferris wheel so many of which are found now in cities around the world. However, we, a party of eight, had a dinner booked in a capsule and it went without a hitch.
Normally a meal at an attraction such as this is rather poor fare because the attaction is the star and they can get away with very ordinary food.
Not so in this case. The food was immpeccable. Served perfectly by our hostess in the capsule, and by the fabulous chefs and staff who brought the dishes to the capsule with exact timing. The meal was excellent and bettered those we had subsequently in Singapore city restaurants. Brilliant.",,,
,,Panoramic city views,4,,"Had a good experience on the Singapore Flyer. Excellent views. You sit in a large bubble as the flyers turns one full revolution, which takes about 30 min. I had already done a night rooftop tour of the city and felt that this was a bit overkill. It's also probably best at night - but I'm sure that's when it's most crowded.",,,
,,So Slooow,3,,"The Flyer was too slow and I Think if you dont mind sitting or staring at the view , hop in . We could not wait for the ride to finish , it feels like forever when we were on it .",,,
,,Awesome,4,,"Ok so I am scared of heights but hubby got me on here!
I found it very good even though I hate heights. You will see everything around so it is definitely worth the price!
It travels very slowly and 1 circuit will take 30 minutes.
The pods have seating and quiet relaxing music, with information written around the inside.
Views are fantastic!",,,
,,A must for every Singapore Tourists,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a must for any Singapore vacationers. The view is great. We had no hesitation. There was a breeze from the ticket office in the observation cabin. The trip took about 25 minutes. The view was stunning. I recommend it to everyone, it only. Price 33 SGD.",,,
,,An awesome view,5,,That's so happy to be there and watching the skyline of the modern city. I've there many times but still feel breathtaking. Highly recommend.,,,
,,One of the best of it's kind,4,,Like everything in Singapore this is clean and efficient. It offers one of the best giant wheel experiences anywhere. In daytime the views are great over a large part of the city but in the evening darkness the views are simply spectacular when the skyscrapers and hotels are all immuminated. The nightly light and laser show over the marina and bay seen from the flyer is one of the most dramatic ever.,,,
,,As imagined,4,,"It gives you a 360 degree view of marina bay and a little beyond. Its a 30 mins trip and trust me time flies - but its still good enough to click pictures.

Timing it is very important. If you go on a monday (read as not a public holiday) you have high chances to get a private capsule. Also if you would like to view it under the sun or during night you would have to time it. To have the best of both worlds twilight is the best time. Ask at the ticket counter for the perfection time.

Its a little sad that people touch their hands and sweat to the glass + the light reflection on the glass hammers one from clicking pictures.

General info.
They charge 33 sgp for a ride.
Also the places has 6d station and flight simulator along with some decent restaurants with exceptional view and a food court.
The road next to it is used for formula 1 racing.",,,
,,Expensive,4,,But then what isn't in Singapore?? It takes half an hour to go around once and that costs $30. Is it worth it?? Who knows. I'd rather drink a beer.,,,
,,Opt for the Skypark,3,,"The Singapore Flyer is the second biggest wheel in the world. That itself makes it an attraction. Nice setting in the beautiful Marina Bay makes it even more interesting.
But, the pricey ticket for a limited 30 min ride, makes the Marina Bay Sands a better option for the Singapore panorama.",,,
,,Try to visit at dusk,5,,"This is definitely a ""must experience"" attraction. Even if you don't have a head for heights you can sit in the middle of a capsule and still admire the view without getting close to a window. If you go at dusk you can still admire the views and watching the city light up is a great experience.",,,
,,Pricey but a great view,3,,Air conditioned cabins and a great view. A little pricey but worth doing at least once. Good to have someone who can point out some interesting things. I did not.,,,
,,Fly high over Singapore,5,,Great way to see 360degrees of beautiful Singapore!! Don't forget your camera!! The queue moved pretty quickly just before lunch time. There were only 4 people in our cabin so we got to see everything easily!! Very clear day!! Have also been up at night which is another nice experience! Love the lights,,,
,,Beautiful but maybe overpriced,5,,Love the view and it was so scary. It was nice that you can do the dinner option at night and the view is probably more beautiful at night,,,
,,Must visit.. Amazing ride,4,,I visited there in the month of Nov for honeymoon.. I had chosen to take a ride of Singapore flyer.. Amazing ride. everyone should take this ride... You can experience the full view of beautiful singapore.. But they charge really high for pictures clicked by them.. In one block there were around 6-8 people's can accommodate.. You can experience beautifull pics as the speed of this flyer is very slow.. All ages of people's can take this ride..,,,
,,Fabulous views,5,,Well organsied - and simple to get to using Hop on- Hop off SIA bus. Lots of space within capsule so you can easily get 360 degree shots.,,,
,,Too bad,1,,"It was a very bad experience for me and my family, it is a complete waste of time as it goes around for 45 mins, instead I highly recommend going to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. Do not waste your time here.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer..,4,,One of the most famous in Singapore.. It's nice to have an experience of flyer.. It moves very slow.. When you are at the top you can have the best view of Singapore.. One time go... A bit boring as it takes lot of time for one round..,,,
,,Nothing much,2,,"Well, to me it's just spending money to go up and see scenery that's all. No different from viewing it from a building. So it was a little boring and nothing much for me.",,,
,,Stunning views at night,4,,"The opened extra ticket offices when the queque started getting long so we didn't have to wait that long. The line up to get on wasn't long either, it is run very efficiently. It is in a good location so you get stunning views of Singapore's Harbour and Marina.",,,
,,If you have seen one...,3,,It is what it is. However around it all that you would see can be seen and visited up close. The racing circuit perhaps is better viewed from on high. Given the cost it is not in my top ten must sees.,,,
,,"worthwhile visit, expensive but fun",5,,"Not crowded, which was great. Recommended. 30SIN is expensive. Takes 45 minutes I think so it is relaxing, airconditioned, and best to do in daylight I should think. Easy to get a bus there.",,,
,,Loved it,5,,"Have been on many ferris wheels now except the London Eye,and loved every moment of it.Its slow but gracious,giving you plenty of opportunity to take photos,chat and consume yourself with the scenery.",,,
,,Wonderful view of the City,4,,One of the main attractions that should not be missed in the city. We get an amazing view of the oceans surrounding the place and also of the local topography which makes it a worth ride.,,,
,,An Eye for Singapore too... that is it,4,,The flyer is the Eye of Singapore and offers some good panoramic views of the city with its sky scrapers and its landscaping.,,,
,,Time out,3,,"We were a 3 families with kids not only did we have a lovely view of Singapore, it also gave us parents some unwinding time as the kids were enthralled with the views.",,,
,,largest wheel flyer in the world,5,,I know about this wheel flyer is a huge and lastgest more than London Eye.this place can see around and panoramic views with a various views of the city garden. nice and fantastic,,,
,,Flyer,3,,"Like all other flyers, it goes super slow buy you can have the view of the entire city from the flyer.",,,
,,Singapore view from up,4,,"I think it's okay to try this at least once on your Singapore visit. You can't expect many things because it meant to get you to see the Singapore view from up. I went with my family at night so there was less queue. Only 2 groups and us left. Not so long, only 30 minutes max and it was nice because you can see the lights from the city. Good for photos, I guess. But if you are thinking to book it for dinner with you loved one, they can make it too. Not cheap so maybe think again if you are on a budget.",,,
,,Amazing views at night,5,,"It was raining a bit and we were not sure what kind of view we were going to get at the top. We noticed people were still riding the flyer so we took a risk.

We boarded and luckily the Chingay parade just started at the Stadium. There were neon dragons and floats parading around with dancers. The first half is facing backwards so it's more of a city view. But then at the second half you'll get the Marina Bay view which is more amazing. Recommended to do this in your first few days of your Singapore trip, so you can ""point"" to your destinations and appreciate them from the distance, before you actually go to them in the next days.

The flyer pods were also spacious, big, and glass all around so you can crouch to the floor if you wanted to and still get a view. Highly recommended!",,,
,,Good to see City fromo a different perspective,4,,"though not worth the price of approx 30 SGD, it is a must visit for tourist who have never been to a ride like flyer before. For people already having visited ferris wheels in other parts of the world can give a skip and try Marina Bay sands instead...",,,
,,Stunning view,5,,A little too overpriced but its a great way to see the entire city from the top. We went there during the evening period and it was lovely with all the light decor around the city.,,,
,,"Wow, nice view",4,,"Das ride takes about 30-minutes for around trip. Cabin can take up to about twenty+ peoples. If you happen to visit during a clear sunny day. Able to view till Indonesia Island side.
Best go mit group of friends, so that its like have your own private party room up there. But only last for 30-minutes of wild party",,,
,,Does what it's meant to,4,,"The carriages are clean and the views are good, we didn't have to queue for too long and was exactly what we'd expected from an observation wheel. Exactly the same concept as the London Eye. Not much more can be said really!",,,
,,Top of the World!,5,,"What a fantastic way to see Singapore and, on a clear day, Malaysia! The views from the top of the largest observation wheel in the world are breathtaking. Even though it was raining when we went on the views were stunning. Excellent wheelchair access too, free for cater.",,,
,,Sights,5,,Love the view from up high. It takes about 30 minutes for the total ride. Views are spectacular 360掳 day or night. You can even book a cabin for dinner for 2 or or more if so desired.,,,
,,Great view of the city,5,,"Although it was raining, the views were breath taking. The ride took 30 minutes and as the wheel turned you got a panaromic view of the city. It's enclosed so weather is not a factor. The pictures they took were excellent. They imposed it on different scenes. If you fly on Singapore Air, you get a ten percent discount.",,,
,,Unique view of the City,4,,"The Flyer offers a unique view of the city. It moves very slowly and sedately and gives you ample opportunity to take photographs.

We had a lovely clear day and could see for miles. We were also lucky in that there was no queue. We walked to the desk, bought tickets and walked straight on. I had fully expected to stand in line and wait for a while but very happy that I didn't!

A fun way to see the city.",,,
,,Breathtaking views!,5,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our ride. The views are amazing, and you really get to experience the whole city in this short ride. It is slow enough that you can get quality pictures taken.",,,
,,Good to spend the evening..,4,,"You can see the whole city from here. Its a nice place to visit after sunset - so you can see the city totally lit up. But if you go during the day, you can identify the different spots and its fun to keep guessing :-)",,,
,,Good experience,5,,Very good experience. Worth the price! You can even book a dinner but in advance. Especially if it's a rainy day and there's not much you can do outdoors,,,
,,Amazing view,5,,"Very nice place, air conditioned cabin and excellent view. Various places can be seen from this flyer. Although it's on the costlier side but those amazing views are worth it. It takes around 35 to 40 minutes to complete one round. They have some dinner arrangements as well, though I'm not sure about it.",,,
,,amazing view,5,,"overlooking all over singapore, merlion park, gardens by bay and marina bay sands, esplanade, fountain show! perfect!",,,
,,Perfect way to enjoy the Singapore skyline,5,,"A must do when in Singapore, well worth a visit perfect way to see the skyline, cost 33 dollars but worth it",,,
,,Nice views..,4,,"Touted the world's biggest observatory wheel, this flyer is a good visit. Choice of day or night view though I recommend day view to get a sight of all attractions from high above",,,
,,Excellent as my rating..,5,,"The first place to start our Singapore trip..
From this place you can have an oversight view of the whole city at one go..
Since I with my family are cleanliness freak, where amused to see that even from the top point on this flyer we could not see any point of dirt..
Haha..okay coming back to the flyer, the view is breathtaking..
U can see the gardens by the bay with Marina Bay Sands also..",,,
,,Fun!,5,,"This was not too expensive for 30 minutes. Great views. Not too scary for my youngest. Would have been amazing on a clear day, but it was a good time on a rainy day. Stuff to do around it as well!",,,
,,Up up in the sky,5,,"The entrance is a mall with escalators that tries to distract you with photographies and other things along the queue. It turns very slow, and it allow to enter and exit easily. There was a place to sit, in the middle, The view was amazing and I could take lots of photos through the glass. From the highest point, you see Marina Bay.",,,
,,Ok,4,,"Ok experience with some nice views especially if you go during the evening when the lights are turned on, gives it a different dimension.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,Its so amazing and it was to high and so scary too. you can see the whole city from there. The best experience ever done.,,,
,,Once in a life time experience!!,3,,It's priceyy!! I think. We were lucky enough to get into the capsule around 6.45pm. So we enjoyed both day ( with a sunset view) and night (city skyline view is superbb). We love it. They have a small local kind of food court down there and we tried the bak kut teh..slurpppp...deliciousss,,,
,,flyer at night,5,,"We booked a Singapore sling package, this gave us a complete car to ourselves, also including a Singapore sling drink, and direct access to flyer, we arrived early and had a meal at the food vendors underneath the flyer, there food is good and cheap.
You get to wait in a private area, you then get escorted to your car, presented with your drink, then you just relax and take in the view of Singapore at night.",,,
,,Amazing view,4,,It's one of my favorite attractions in Singapore. You can get to see the whole island from the top. Went there at night so that i could see the whole island lit up with lights.,,,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,"It's a fantastic way to check out Singapore Skyline, it's worth your money. Better experience in my opinion if you do it before the sunset. We loved it!",,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,Breathtaking view of Singapore in stand up gondola with a bench seat in the middle. Not for the faint hearted if you don't like heights - like my good wife who sat on the seat and would not move. Goes very slow so you get a good long look at Singapore. Takes about 30 mins to go all the way around . It does not stop so you jump on as it moves - that's how slow it goes. A must do attraction.,,,
,,Beautiful Views,5,,"Used our Singapore Airlines Explorer Pass for a free ride on the 1st February 2016. Weather as excellent so we had a perfect view of the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Cable cars to Sentosa Island, Singapore CBD & suburbs. There were 2 other couples in the pod with us and it took about 30 minutes for 1 revolution. Larger than The Wheel of Brisbane where we live.",,,
,,Must Ride!,4,,"We really enjoyed the ride. I was with my big family of 13. On top, you can see the very beautiful Singapore skylines. We took group pictures with the different landmarks as background.",,,
,,Amazing Experience,5,,"The Singapore Flyer was until recently the highest in the world (Las Vegas now has one 5' higher). The cost is around $25 U.S. and the trip takes 30 minutes, so it's slow enough that even people afraid of heights (like me) won't have any problem. The overview of the city is absolutely stunning. Go early in the morning when there are no crowds and you'll share your large car with only one or two other couples. This is a must do activity when in Singapore.",,,
,,Great views!,5,,"My husband and I visited in the morning and were fortunate enough to have a capsule to ourselves. We enjoyed the panoramic views of Singapore and took advantage of the photo opportunities.

The Flyer itself is a wonderful piece of engineering and felt totally safe. The ride lasted approximately 30 minutes and represented good value for money.",,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,"We got the opportunity to ride at 11 AM, the containers are air conditioned so does not matter at what time. The duration of ride is around 45 minutes. There is enough time to enter inside the cabin. Each cabin there are 10-12 passengers sitting arrangement provided. After entering we started moving upwards and real fun started! you can see the entire city at different heights and different angles. You can do the real photography as per you wish. One side you can see the big ocean and other side you can see the big buildings. We really don't realise how the time of 45 minutes completed. This was the really great experience.",,,
,,Singapore in the bird eye view,4,,-Riding in the evening is better. -not free. -worth your money:if you love the city and wanna see SG from the bird eye view. - 15 mins ride. -waiting depends but not more than 20 mins.,,,
,,Great view,4,,"Although we hesitated as it's a tourist attraction, we really enjoyed the time we spent. Very relaxing, amazing view. Good recommendation",,,
,,Awesome view,4,,The view from the Singapore Flyer is better than the one from the top deck of Marina Bay Sands. I would rather spend money on this than pay money to the top deck of Marina Bay Sands.,,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,"Large carriages, spectacular 360 degree views, well worth a visit, friendly staff, a definite photo opportunity",,,
,,Nice views,5,,"Visited on a nice day, but I think in the evening it would have been nicer. The views of the entire city, the gardens, marina bay are really nice.",,,
,,Wow,5,,One of the best attractions in Singapore. Fantastic views and very relaxing. Take your own photos and don't bother with the overpriced cheesy green screen souvenir ones,,,
,,"Great views, worth the money",5,,"It is a great way to start your city trip. We have been there in the morning, there was no queue and the actual capsule is spacious and you will get a great view on the city. I did not regret booking this attraction.",,,
,,Wonderful views,4,,"Sitting in a prime location it affords views across the F1 track, the Gardens on the bay, the City and the sea. They only put ten people to a pod when we went on so it allowed plenty of room to move around to get the best views.",,,
,,To have full singapore view -Excellent view in Night,4,,This is huge flyer. From this flyer you can see full singapore view. To have full fun and excellent view prefer in evening after lighting on. Price of this is littler bit high. it is 33SGD.,,,
,,Nice way to see the Singapore skyline,4,,"Boasting just a bit more height than its sister, The London Eye, the Singapore Flyer is a memorable way to get a bird's eye view of this amazing city.",,,
,,Excellent,5,,"Takes about 20 minutes the veiws are amazing. Went in December, Christmas decorations inside the capsule & Christmas music playing. Awesome",,,
,,Nice,5,,Great experience in the air-conditioned gondola in the summer heat. The views were awesome and nice experience.,,,
,,A clearer daywould have been better,4,,"Enjoyed this trip, but put it off much of the day due to rain. It was quite pricey ws these things are, but kt help when wt the too give a sense of pwrt of th city and where thjngs where. Large pods, and not too mwny people in them, i think wbout 8 or 10 in ours.",,,
,,Awesome...,5,,"It was my first experience in giant wheel, Singapore flyer was awesome... The beauty of Singapore at night made me speechless. Suparb example of engineering.",,,
,,Good way to see overall Singapore,5,,"In the day, you can see far and even Indonesia. At night, you will see the very lit up Singapore. Great view and experience. Very reasonable priced also. Take note if it had been raining though. I went after the rain had stopped half hour before, but due to possibility of thunder, operation of the flyer is stopped. Do not be in a hurry to leave though, have a coffee or drink there and wait, the operation was resumed pretty fast the last time I was there.",,,
,,Excellent views!,5,,"We headed to the flyer, expecting it to be really busy and in fact it was so quiet. We had a pod all to ourselves and they stopped at intervals so we could marvel at the amazing views! Take a camera and enjoy the views.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer Review,4,,"The price of this attraction compares favourably with the London Eye..33 SGD versus 21 GBP, and its significantly easier to get on as you would expect. Ride duration is around 30 minutes, and you get to see an amazing view of Gardens by the Bay, the Singapore business centre skyline, Marina Bay/Barrage, and the golf course amongst others. Ensure you have a good camera with you...sometimes using a smartphone its a struggle with the lighting in the glass cage to get a really quality photo of people in with you, along with the view outside.

At ground level is a nice little hawker centre for eats and drinks when you have finished.",,,
,,Fantastic View,4,,"Yes, it's a MUST when visiting SINGAPORE...
The best view will be around 6.30pm to 7.00pm...you get to view the sunset around the bay and also by 7.00pm you could view the lights up on the office building..
it's a very beautiful sight...worth the ride up..",,,
,,It麓s a 麓must go麓in Singapore!,5,,"The flyer itself is awesome. Higher than London Eye. As you go higher, you can see the whole Singapore bay, and some of the main attractions of the city as The Marina Bay, Gardens by the bay, the F1 circuit and A part of Sentosa island. If you go by night, enjoy the lights show the city offers.
In the complex where the Flyer is, there are lots of others attractions, including a multimidia history tour, a mall, the place where you can sit and let fishes clean your feet (awesome!!) and other tour tickets.",,,
,,On the Top of Singapore !,5,,"A worthwhile experience to see the entire city all at once ! Loved the concept of the capsules accommodation for 20-28 members in each capsule !
Very appropriately organised place and a must visit to take a short snap of the entire city from the top :)",,,
,,Good View,5,,The Singapore flyer gives you an amazing Ariel view of Singapore. This is a must for all tourist. Try and go in about 6.30 pm so that you can get a view in the day and night.,,,
,,very nice place,5,,"You should go here once , You will get to see whole Singapore.. I recommend this to everyone who visits Singapore",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"This Singapore Flyer duration is 30 Minutes since the first time we enter the capsule. We need the Ticket to enjoy this ride. We can see view of singapore from the height. Here we can also held so many occasion but there are some price for doing that like candle light dinner for a couple in 1 capsule, or maybe doing some meeting or others occasion.",,,
,,Great views of the city!,5,,This is a MUST when visiting Singapore...I advised to go at sundown so you can see the city at day and night. You won't be disappointed!,,,
,,Amazing views!,5,,"This thing is awesome. Just be aware that it will run you $33 per person. Show your Singapore airlines ticket stub for a 10% discount. The ride last about 30 minutes, go mid day for less crowds. Each pod is air-conditioned and very comfortable, especially if your family is the only people in there. Was worth it for us!",,,
,,beautiful,5,,Love to be in Singapore flyer.. its moving very slowly so you get lot of time to see around beautiful view of bay and city also marina bay five star hotel. Children and elderly who got phobia of giant wheel can also use this. I did it on day time and next time i will do in evening hours. Worth to visit. Dr Jain,,,
,,Amazing View!!,4,,It was an amazing experience.. 360 degree view of singapore.. it is very close to Sea and the financial hub.. you can easily spot the main attractions of singapore from there.. it is worth going once.. the beauty is immeasurable..,,,
,,No queues and excellent views,5,,What an excellent way to see the harbour area of Singapore. We took the MRT to Promenade and then a short walk (5 mins) to the Singapore Flyer. It is probably best to buy your tickets online but you can do this when you arrive at the Flyer. There is also a discount for Singapore Airlines passengers so make sure you take your used boarding passes with you. There was no queue at all but we went on a rainy New Years Day in mid morning. The views are excellent and the pods are clean and spacious and my dad who has a fear of heights was fine in the pod as the floor is solid and not glass. The ride took about 40 mins and there are a number of cafes and restaurants back at the base of the flyer. Excellent links with the tourist buses and a discount for people who use the buses.,,,
,,Wow!,5,,"We managed to get the best photographs of Singapore on this, we also saw the formula 1 race track which I hadn't realised was to the side of us. Fantastic, something that has just got to be done!",,,
,,Nice time,5,,"Feel fresh when I went in the morning,I had very good time and again,I wish to go there again one day! Have lots nice time to visit in Singapore...",,,
,,Excellent,5,,Excellent. It's said to be one of the biggest Ferris wheels in the world. It lasted for approx 25 mins which was perfect timing. You get a 360 degree view of Singapore.. Wasn't cheap but worth the money.,,,
,,Singapore 360 degree view.,4,,"It was a wonderful experience in the Singapore Flyer. Though we being in a big family group were in dilemma to climb as it looked boring and very slow from the ground, but we loved it.
The flyer isnt very slow and very stable and gives sufficient time to look Singapore from the top- both the sea-side and the city side.",,,
,,Stunning Views,5,,I visited couple of months back with a group of 10 person. The views from Flyer was stunning. Seaport and city views are really fantastic. Enjoyed photographs in the flyer and from the flyer. Must visit in Singapore..,,,
,,Nice activity if you got some time to kill,4,,"If you got some time to spare and want to do something different yet calm, I can recommend you to go to the Singapore Flyer. I wouldn't say it revolutionized my Singapore experience but as long as the weather is clear, it will give you a really nice view over the city.

It鈥檚 easy to get to and I didn鈥檛 even have to wait in line once there so it could well be worth a visit :)

If you鈥檙e looking for an even better view, I would point you in the direction of the observation deck at the Sands Skypark.",,,
,,Great view of the city,4,,"This is the best view of the city, for sure. Thy offer dinner inside the cabin which must be very amazing. 30 minute ride, great for kids",,,
,,Beautiful view of the city,5,,Another thing in Singapore which is must for every traveller. Best time to enjoy Singapore flyer is after sunset. No point visiting it in sun shine. In dark Singapore flyer gives u a breathtaking view of a marvellous city. Beautiful well managed and comfortable.,,,
,,A Must Ride of Singapore,5,,"Firstly I want to tell you that this is the place you definitely not regret after in, as this is the must have place to see the beautiful country from the top of the heights. It covers a whole round in 38 Minutes & you will not hardly find this thing that whether it is Moving or not & you will not know when the 38 Minutes will be gone & the ride is over. Some people find it boring as they think that to seeing the city from one ride that's not worth which is very little true,but in my opinion you should try at least once & see the difference.",,,
,,Slow t,3,,"A view of a limited part of Singapore. Relaxing, and cool. On the way in, there were story boards with vital statistics of the structure.",,,
,,Good Tourist thing to do,4,,Quality of the ride was good. Worth doing the ride. It goes really slow and get a good view of Singapore.,,,
,,A good overall view of the city.,4,,"By no means is this a must do when in Singapore. But, my relatives insisted in coming here. It provided a good night view of Singapore - all the bright lights glowing into the sky.",,,
,,Amazing engineering infrastructure!,4,,"Great experience with fabulous view, thoroughly recommend it! Well priced, nice and safe and gives a really big view!",,,
,,Singapore flyer,4,,"Good experience leading up before you go on flyer views from the top are good but it's best if you have clear skies ,if it's overcast then your views are limited on a clear day you can make out the coast of Malaysia and batam island Indonesia",,,
,,Beautiful view from the top,5,,Absolutely loved this attraction. Can see all the way to Santosa Island was magnificent. Highly recommend it to anyone. Went in the afternoon as a beautiful sunny day and the line was very short,,,
,,great veiws,5,,"great views from the flyer ,and if you have flown with Singapore airlines ,use your boarding card for a good discount",,,
,,An Hour of Stillness,3,,"The Flyer is everything Singapore isn't: slow-paced, stillness, mundane. Unless you would like to take a change from the hustle & bustle life of Singapore, do swing by. If not, you're not missing out much.",,,
,,Huge one!,5,,"Nice place to visit. Those who enjoy rides must visit it,it's hugeeee.... At night it looks spectacular with all the lights. There is a small shopping place there, but the rates are very high. Same stuff you get at Mustafa or Chinatown less than half the price.",,,
,,"Beautiful view, a bit slow",4,,As one can expect the views from the flyer are amazing but it is a bit slow and one could expect maybe an interactive map or some way to educate the visitors about what they see :-),,,
,,Over rated,2,,"Firstly we were put in with way too many people so didn't even get a seat. The carriage we were in was very noisy, so didn't really enjoy as much as we could have. The view was quite good, however for what we got don't think it was worth what we paid!",,,
,,Relaxing,3,,"It's a nice way to relax and get a good look at Singapore from a high enough vantage. But if you're looking for something to do, this thirty to forty minute ride around might bore you. It's a slow, calming ride, perfect for when the day is clear or when you've been on your feet and need to take a seat whilst checking one item on your Singapore to-dos. When it's raining, you can forget about it, as you just might get to view the inside of your cabin for the entire duration of the ride.",,,
,,Good way to see Singapores city scape,4,,"We went on the Flyer just as a typical Singapore thunderstorm blew in. It made it more dramatic and as is usual it was over in a matter of minutes and we managed to get some great views over the city. Like most things in Singapore it is not cheap, but I think it is worth it. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The ticket booth is some way from the entrance but easy enough to find.",,,
,,dont go waste of money.,2,,Its an waste of money. People who stay at marina bay sands is an no go for them. it has same views as its from marina bay sands.,,,
,,Best view of the city,5,,The best place to see the whole city. Moving so alow that you almost dont feel that is moving. 28 sgd fee per adult. Not cheep hut worth it.,,,
,,The Singapore Flyer,3,,"The Singapore Flyer was fun to take, although the view from the Marina Bay Sands observation deck is better in that it is higher and you see a bit more. Take the flyer for the experience of being on one of the symbols of Singapore.",,,
,,Touch the sky,5,,"The ride was amazing, it travels very slow and takes 40 minutes to complete on the ride we had, the view is astounding as it was a clear and sunny day. It was just amazing how far you could see & how many cargo ships were in the bay, not to mention how high up you were, it is actually a bit scary.",,,
,,Above the Marina Bay,5,,"Fascinating view of skycraper and Singapore landmarks, i.e. Marina Bay Sands, Merlion park and the Garden by the Bay..",,,
,,City View,5,,"Have a close look and you'll find it different then the normal flyers, its huge, 30 mins ride must visit , if u don't mind spending few $ and it isn't as fast as you think",,,
,,Good way to see much of the bay area,4,,"Rode this mid-week, so little in the way of other customers. Got an excellent view of much of the reclaimed bay area. Peaceful and gave excellent views.",,,
,,Too expensive,3,,"This is like London Eye in London and it takes about 30mins to take around. We visited here in the morning but strongly recommend to go at night. Here would have an maxing night view. For us, here is expensive just watching the view.",,,
,,Nice view of Singapore,5,,Just get into the flyer for an excellent view of singapore. But London eye is much better than this.,,,
,,Expectacular!,5,,"We tried it this morning as the weather was good and there was no line up. It was quiet actually, just the perfect time. It takes only 30 minutes but the view is great.",,,
,,"You can get equally good views from a rooftop bar, for much less money",3,,"Whilst the views are spectacular on a clear day, for the cost of the ticket, you can get equally good views from the many rooftop bars in Singapore and get to enjoy a drink at the same time. A favourite is Altitude bar at 1 Raffles Place, but you will need to ensure you meet the dress code. No shorts, singlets or thongs/flip flops. Entrance fee covers your first drink, and it is better to get there earlier as it is very crowded later in the evening.",,,
,,still the same like previous visit,4,,"this flyer was amazing, located nearby the marina bay and singapore garden by the bay. good option for family vacation, but need more new attraction, or another interesting stuff. otherwise people will not come again to this place",,,
,,Great!,5,,It is like the other flyers however the view is stunning!!! Worth paying the price. Nice food stalls next to it. I would recommend it!,,,
,,Nice but expensive,4,,Seems like every major city (international and in the US) has to have a big ferris wheel nowadays. If you like to see a new city from far above or if you enjoy ferris wheels this attraction is for you. A bit pricey but worth it if you like the view! We enjoyed the ride and the view. A family attraction for sure! Saw lots of smiles and giggles from family members on this ride.,,,
,,A one-off experience and that's it,3,,"This flyer does not really offer much excitement. The view and sights of Singapore are always fantastic. As a resident, I come here to bring visitors for a one-off experience if they want to relax and enjoy the sights for 30mins. I find this attraction expensive for the experience that it offers.",,,
,,Great Views,5,,"A little pricey, but well worth the views. You get a great view of the shipping harbour, the various architectural styles that make up Singapore. Worth the money if your not afraid of heights.",,,
,,I can enjoy,4,,"Because I have acrophobia, I don't like riding as like as going higher. However, this is not flyer that I am afraid of. it's cabin is too big to feel awful. If you have acrophobia as like as me, try it !",,,
,,best to take the perfect view of singapore skyline,5,,its the best place to take the view of Singapore skyline n its good to visit during the sunset. must visit spot in Singapore,,,
,,Awesome Experience,5,,"My wife and I recently spent time in Singapore and chose to visit the beautiful Singapore Flyer. This is an experience that no one should miss, the view from the flyer is the most stunning I have had the privileged of experiencing. If you get a chance to go to Singapore, I urge you to take the time to experience it for yourself, you won't be disappointed.",,,
,,Worth doing if you are holidaying in Singapore,4,,"The half hour ride around the flyer gave plenty of time for photo opportunities of all the city views. May be considered expensive - however most activities are. Would recommend for first time visitors to Singapore, and have been told by may locals not to do the flyer of a night as you don't get to see much of the city (just lights), we went late afternoon and were able to see most things expect it was cloudy obscuring more distant parts of the island.",,,
,,Not worth it,2,,"Unless you are really really in need to ride a Ferris wheel in Singapore, u need not bother doing this. The view is not that great and the price wise is really expensive.
Most locals don't bother visiting this tourist attraction once they have done it the first time as its really quite dull...

For a lower price, u can instead visit Marina Bay Sands skypark which doesn't have a time limit and the view is higher and so much better. U can trust me and that's coming from a local. Cheers.",,,
,,Singapore from birds view,5,,An excellent way to see the Marina Bay and surrounding area from top. Also you will see the F1 racing track and ships in the port. Further south in the sea you may imagine equator which is just 150 kilometers away.,,,
,,very attractive,4,,"very attractive ,very close to marina sand hotel, very recommended to have the ride during the sunset, it almost cost 23 singphore dollars",,,
,,Nice but Not Cheap,3,,"If you are new to Singapore and want to see how the city's outlook then this ride is perfect, however it can be considered expensive for just seating in slow motions",,,
,,Expensive for what it is,2,,"My wife really wanted to go on this so I went. It takes like half an hour to go around and well, that's it. There's only so much looking at the skyline before it gets boring.

It's also very expensive as well. I say double the speed, charge a 1/4 of the price and it'll be worth a visit.",,,
,,Nice innovation but a boring and expensive experience,3,,"We went here to see the views. The wheel itself was a little too slow for my liking and the views were not all that spectacular. Their was also a hefty price tag. The capsule was quite large and comfortable.
If/when visiting Singapore do give this a try if you have time, but if not there isn't much you would have missed out on.",,,
,,Fantastic views of Singapore,4,,One of the best ways to see Singapore island. Very comfortable ride on the Flyer. Beware though if you don't like heights. Brilliant! Don't miss it!,,,
,,Clear Sky. Beautiful Weather.,5,,"Best option to see Singapore Skyline in a child friendly environment. Both romantic and cool for couples and family. Was a clear sky day to see beyond just the nearby areas. We enjoy final 10 mins of the ride seeing the rain came in which is also beautiful. Highly recommended stop for both local and overseas guests.

The only unfortunate moment was the not so nice experience encountered with the ordering of photo. Errors made and was not handled properly by the staff. In the end, errors still exist but it was taking too long and we rushing off. Only thing to make Singapore Flyer trip not so complete.",,,
,,Great view,4,,Great view and service was excellent. overall great experience to see the whole Singapore from up above.,,,
,,Must try,4,,"I rode 3 times. It was on 2011, 2012 and 2015. I could see the development of Singapore from the top.
Journey Dreams inside is also interesting to see and explore. Best time to ride Flyer is at day time.
Relaxed and enjoy view from the top.",,,
,,Such a great way to see Singapore,5,,"I am terrified of heights, but I was like no no I have to do it. It's iconic! And I am so glad I did it. The sights are unreal, and the height things did not bother me one bit! The rooms you go into are spacious, and there are seats - not too many people.",,,
,,Nothing special,3,,"I guess you have great cured from the top, we didn't go up, but it is not different from the London Eye and is quite expensive as well",,,
,,Take a ride catch the sights,5,,"Do not miss this attraction it's worth the money. We all enjoyed it lots to see good views and seats to sit on, you can even book a pod to dine in enjoy",,,
,,Beautiful views over the city and Quays,4,,Lovely ride up to the skyline offering great views over the city. there are beautiful gardens at the bottom to explore while you await your turn and a selection of bars and restaurants.,,,
,,On the top of Singapore,4,,"Nice place to see Singapore skyline. Definitely recommended for visitors with short stay of one or two days in Singapore.
Flyer gives you 360 degree view of harbor & skyline. Plus some beautiful views of Marina bay sands hotel & Garden by the bay. As it moves very slowly you can cherish the views. It will be beneficial if you have some local with you who can explain various landmarks.
Below the flyer is F1 circuit. Probably best way to see F1 race will be on the Flyer. Unique experience in entire world.",,,
,,Amazing View,4,,Singapore flyer is must not to be missed. Amazing view and enjoyable. It moves slowly because of which you can enjoy it thoroughly,,,
,,Fantastic view,4,,"When we visited there was only a small queue and 10 people in total in the capsule. It is a longish walk in the heat from the closest MRT to a multi level complex, tickets can be purchased on the ground level. The ride was excellent, not too fast or slow, but some information on the view points of interest would have been useful. Worth doing a value for the cost",,,
,,"Scenic in the Day, Charming at Night",5,,"Been there a few times with kids and parents. It's a comfortable attraction to obtain a bird's eye view of the urban landscape. Within half an hour, the view changes drastically and if you visit at different times of the day, the feeling is not the same. Worth a repeat visit and if you are in luck, you might get the entire cabin to yourselves which is the most exciting part.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"It's quite expensive but if you have some money and time to spare, it's quite nice to see Singapore at night from above.",,,
,,Birds eye view of a truly beautiful city - from day to night,5,,"Prior to going on the Singapore Flyer, the only other *big* wheel I'd been on was when they had one in Perth, WA a few years ago. A fear of heights has kept me off these things in the past. However, a helicopter flight over the 12 Apostles 3 years ago cured me of that [well up to a point]

A fabulous taxi driver we had the previous day told us the best thing to do is try and go on the flyer a bit before sunset so you get to see the view in daylight hours, as the sun sets and then complete the ride as all of Singapore's CBD and the Marina and surrounds light up. Glad we took that advice because it is truly magical. The pods on the flyer can hold up to 30 people and are extremely sound when you are in them...no bumps or strange movements of any kind. We had a decent downpour of rain whilst on the flyer which simply added to the spectacle of it all [did make taking pics a bit ordinary once sun set was upon us and after but hey...should be looking with your eyes more than the lens anyway]",,,
,,360 view of Sg,5,,A ride one shouldn't miss. worth the experience plus you get to see the whole of Singapore in thirty minutes or so...,,,
,,Flying in Singapore,4,,What an experience. I have been on the London Eye and many more Wheels around the world and this one is up there with the best. The experience of seeing Singapore from the sky was exhilarating and left me with a great feeling.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Good place to see Singapore in a higher angle. If you are travelling by Metro I suggest you take a cab afterwards because the location is a little far from the Metro station. Don't forget to try the food court because the food is great! I think it's called Bugis St. not sure tho. Anyway, the place is also where you can go ride the HOP on HOP Off bus so if you don't have any plans where to go yet, might as well try yhe HOHO bus first and have a tour around Singapore.",,,
,,Great for short visits!,5,,"Great way to see a lot of the city without much time. Best to take someone along who can point out the highlights - just be aware that if you don't have a group large enough to fill a capsule, they will put strangers in with you, and sometimes they are loud, coughing, etc. which can be unpleasant ...",,,
,,Good view,3,,It does offer a wonderful city view with the full length glass windows. A little bit slow or boring though. May b more suitable for young kids and older adults.,,,
,,Nice view from top,3,,Nice new experience.... But ticket is expensive... Not much to do other than watching the view from the TOP.,,,
,,You must try it,5,,We did it at dusk and the views were spectacular. Wheel goes slow so you have time to walk around and see all sides and take pictures. Seats are in the middle and each car has about a dozen people in it.,,,
,,Amazing views,5,,A great tourist attraction with amazing views of a fantastic city. It's bigger than the London Eye and much cheaper too. It really is a must see for any tourist and I really do recommend it. There's no better way to see this beautiful city then by going on the Flyer.,,,
,,See the city,5,,Walked to the flyer purchased a ticket and had spectacular views of Singapore would recommend this as a must if you visit singapore,,,
,,... the eye of Singapore /// Singapore Flyer,5,,"The Giant wheel that really give the experience of having slow motioned rolling and just climb on and have party till it make round., and see the all Singapore from top of the flyer >>>",,,
,,Extremely worth it!,5,,Views are stunning! And not scary at all for people who are afraid of heights. You don't feel it's moving so a very chilled experience. It's candy for the eyes!,,,
,,Great flight.,4,,"We booked this as we have already done the other one in Melbourne and have only the London one to do to complete the set. We used the MRT to get to the site which was easy and the flyer is only 5 mins walk from the station ,you can see it from the station. The entry is a bit tired and needs some sprucing up to give a better feel but the whole thing is on the site of the Singapore grand prix site. The flights last 30 mins and the capsule is large cool and aired although they could clean the Windows inside a bit more then you would not see people smudgy face and hand prints on it. We went at 10:00 am. The whole things was good and the view was amazing at it went round. People say it's not that good but if you want to see Singapore for the sky this is a must and you can see across the river to the marina bay sands sitting high in the sky as well over the gardens and the bay . Thanks for the experience.",,,
,,A GREAT PLACE TO SEE SINGAPORE 360 DEGREES,5,,This is a must. It is fun and moves so slowly that you do not realize that you are move up or down. It is extremely relaxing and enjoyable.,,,
,,Amazing View,4,,"Singapore flyer is an amazing place, its currently the highest amongst all its peers :)
The view is amazing and you have a lot of options ranging from fine dining to business meetings. Its gives an amazing view of gardens by the bay and the matina bay area.
Must visit place for ur vacation in singapore.",,,
,,Bird's Eye view of the red dot,4,,"A very relaxing way of seeing Singapore. Our group composed of 5 adults, one child and one infant. Not sure if it was because there queue wasn't that long but our group didn't have to share the carriage so it was great! Ride took about 30 minutes which we found a little short but I guess it's how one revolution of the wheel would take.

Strollers were not allowed to be brought into the carriage so had to carry the infant the whole time. Not really a big deal but some might find this a little inconvenient.",,,
,,Stunning views,5,,"Stunning views of the surrounding city, gardens, marina bay and also if you look close enough the Formula 1 track. Reasonably priced, and minimal wait time when we visited.
For something extra special visit the fish spa on the lower levels to leave your tired feet refreshed..",,,
,,Great view of the entire city! Bigger than Hong Kong's or London's wheels!,5,,"We rode the Flyer on a rainy day, but it was worth it ($33/person). Since the weather wasn't perfect, the wait was non-existent, but from the way they are set up to handle crowds using extensive queue's I'm sure the lines get long during holiday seasons. There were only 6 of us in the capsule, so we could move around and see in all directions. The ride lasts 30 minutes, so there is plenty of time to take the views in.",,,
,,Not so good,3,,"Okay it had a great view but that's it, it was very quick to go around much quicker that the one we went on in London. Singapore has lots of high rise buildings and I think most people who stays in those high rise hotels don't bitter with the flyer. Shane was not busy",,,
,,Highlife,5,,"Highlife, great views, worth a visit, gives you a good perspective on singapore. Very good both day and night. Take dinner at the mall whilst there.",,,
,,Good views spoiled by entrance,4,,Loved the views of the city although it was not a very clear day. The ride was slow enough to allow you to enjoy the views from all angles but I would have liked more explanation of what we were seeing inside the car. Our car was quite over crowded and we were jostled quite frequently. Also to get to the ride was a long laborious process past other exhibits and money making opportunities. I know this is quite common now but a bit of a pet hate of mine.,,,
,,Superb view,5,,"Similar to the London eye. When we did this we had the pod to ourselves which was absolutely amazing. Starting the wheel at dusk, so that by the time we got to the top, all the bay was lit up. It looked amazing. I suspect the only other view which might compare is that from the Marina Bay Sands Skypark which we intend to visit next time we're here.",,,
,,Had a great romantic Christmas dinner on Singapore Flyer,5,,"Singapore Flyer was a great experience for my husband and me. In addition to general tickets, they had special tickets for Christmas dinner. The cabin had four tables and we were served by a waiter. The view was very nice. We started the circle when it was still light and finished when it was getting dark, so we got both a day and night view. From Singapore Flyer we could see almost all major attractions, eg Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, etc.",,,
,,Must Visit place during your Singapore Trip,5,,"This is an awesome place to visit, It costs about 33 SGD per person, This complete ride takes about 30 to 40 minutes to complete one round, you can click lovely pictures, specially when you are at the top of your flyer , you can see entire Singapore city in one go. this is luvly to visit during both the times day and night.",,,
,,nice scenery,4,,We finally got a chance to ride on one of Singapore most iconic entertainment. Entrance price is quite expensive but it is good way to see view singapore .,,,
,,Spectacular at night,5,,"The flyer is fab. Clean and spacious cabins with comfortable seats. We went in the evening when the city and garden lights were on, which was very pretty. Great views.",,,
,,Must do experience.,5,,"We travelled on the MRT downtown line, alighting at the newly completed Promenade station. It is a short walk to the Singapore Flyer (10 minutes). The ticket office is located on the ground floor level next to the coach park. Tickets were easy to purchase and we used our Singapore Airline boarding cards to receive a 10% discount. You then take the escalator up to the first floor where the entrance is located. Before you board the flyer you walk through the information centre which gives you details on the construction etc. Once through the centre we boarded our pod. No ques and away we went for about 30 minutes. The views across the city were excellent with non of the pollution from the forrest fires in Indonesia late last year evident. A thoroughly enjoyable trip which I highly recommend.",,,
,,Foodcourt with facilities below,3,,I didn't need the slowmoving Flyer for the view as the Domes at Gardens by the Bay were well visible over the water. I took a prawn noodles lunch at the inexpensive food court below and admired goldfish swimming in the small tropical garden. There is a sightseeing ticket booth and the toilets are clean. A bus stop is just outside the building and gourmet ice cream is also on offer.,,,
,,Decent view for the time and price of admission,3,,A ticket entitles you to one rotation of the wheel which takes 30 minutes. The views are spectacular but you tend to get bored of it by the time you are descending. We went during the day and weather was clear for us to enjoy clear views in all directions. I presume the experience will be quite different at night. Would recommend to anyone visiting Singapore for the first time.,,,
,,Good view of the Singapore City Line,5,,"At the top of the wheel, you will be able to see the entire Singapore. If the weather is good, you could even see Batam, Indonesia too. If you would like to look for cheaper tickets, you could look up the promotions on either groupon.com or qoo10.com. They usually have these promotions regularly.",,,
,,Top of Singapore,5,,Very nice experience and have 360 degree city view. You can see each corner of Singapore. Singapore Flyer value for money.,,,
,,One shot of whole Singapore,4,,"Singapore is a small city and the entire city is visible from this flyer which is larger than the one in London and they keep reiterating it.
Perfect for the panaroma pics . Don't miss the ships on the dock and CBD and the marina Bay sands . We visited this in he morning but the night would be fabulous too, may be better .",,,
,,Visit at Singapore,5,,Nice place to be. There is marvelous view of all the city from flyer. You can take a lot of nice pictures.,,,
,,Do the Singapore Sling trip,5,,"We went on the dusk trip for Singapore sling and it was well worth it.

Upon arrival we were both presented with a small gift (plush you of the flyer mascot) and escorted past the lines (haha) into a private carriage where we were met with 2 well made Singapore slings and a music player from an iPod nano.

Half an hour to enjoy sunset in Singapore with a cocktail in a private carriage is fantastic. I can't recommend this enough.",,,
,,Good to visit once,3,,It is good to visit this place once in the whole life to view the city Take a normal ticket only Do not have dinner on that as it is expensive and does not worth it,,,
,,Great experience,4,,"The Singapore flyer was great, the cabins are air conditioned and very spacious. There was only two of us but we were in our cabin with another 5 people and there was plenty of room to move around and take pictures.",,,
,,Fantastic... under the right conditions,4,,"The regular capsules were spacious and clean, serving parties up to 10 people. One rotation took ca 30 minutes and the view was breathtaking. Pay attention though to loud individuals/families as this could negatively affect your experience.",,,
,,Wow what a view,5,,The line up is really long and you never think that you will get in or it will take hours but it moves very quickly so don't fret!,,,
,,it's wonderful,5,,"Singapore flyer world best experience flyer , with my family i enjoyed this flyer it's excellent view whole Singapore",,,
,,"Nice views, worth the price and time!",5,,"Singapore Flyer is nicely built to give a view of Singapore from the top. It is well managed, reasonably priced and does not disappoint.",,,
,,Its like a moving painting!,5,,It provides excellent 360 degree view of Singapore...we went in the night...so it was doubly attractive to see the illuminated landscape...the speed is adequately slow to enjoy it to the fullest..,,,
,,Amazing views,5,,The views were amazing from the flyer. Great 360 degrees views. It was an easy and pleasant walk along the river to get to it. There were no queues. The flyer is used for the laser show in the evening. Well worth a trip.,,,
,,The Views are Spectacular!!,5,,"A ride on the Singapore Flyer was a part of a tour I took on the Celebrity Millennium. It was my first night in Singapore and the views were wonderful. I had just left the Gardens by the Bay spectacular light show and could still see the lights from the Flyer. It provided great views of Singapore including the Helix bridge, Esplanade, Marina Bay Sands Resort and so much more. It made me excited about seeing Singapore the next day. The night views were very pretty and shows off a lot of what Singapore has to offer.
Each capsule holds about 25 people and the ride is about 30 minutes. There is limited seating for about 12-15 people.",,,
,,My best flyer experience -,5,,"and I have a kind of acrophobia - especially with ferris wheels. The huge structure and clearly stable cars made me go ahead and try it with the family, and it was really great. I never enjoyed a ride before because of the shaking of cars but this one was really safe and offered beautiful panoramic view of the surroundings. We opted for a day visit to see everything around , but I guess a night ride would also be lovely.",,,
,,Maybe overrated,4,,You get to have a birds eye view of the the bay area and the other nearby attractions. You also get to see the formula one track which runs along side the SIngapore Flyer. It can be skipped if you are not too keen. Better to go on top of the Marina Bay Sands,,,
,,Good experience,4,,The Singapore Flyer is perfect for all tourists incl. handicapped people. The staff is very kind/ friendly and will assist you perfect. You will see many parts of Singapore from a different point of view. Great experience ! We will definitely do this once again during nighttime.,,,
,,Interesting,5,,Excellent views of the city! The full circuit takes about 30 to 40 minutes. Staff are friendly and professional.,,,
,,Great Experience,5,,"We rode the Singapore Flyer just on sunset and it was such a beautiful, relaxing way to view the city. It takes 30 minutes and is well worth it. They don't pack too many people in, so there is plenty of space to wander around the cabin and get some great photos. Next time, we would take a champagne flight.",,,
,,Cool,5,,"Ticket price:
Adult : $33
Take a look singapore frow above. Best time to go to singapore flyer is 7pm. We can see singapore at afternoon and at night. We can see marina bay sands, esplanade, garden by the bay, suntec city, merlion, and so many from above.
I wanna go to singapore flyer for 2nd times.",,,
,,Great views.,5,,"Similar to the London eye, fabulous views and air conditioned capsules. Recommended for young and old.",,,
,,"Nice, but expensive!",4,,"It's reaaally nice to see the whole city, especially at night. However there are couple of drawbacks about this activity. First, it's kind of pricey - S$30 for a single adult ticket. So that hurts you're pocket a bit, knowing that you can get the view for free from some of the tallest buildings. Also, more than 20 people can fit into a single cabin, and if you're not one of the first ones to enter, most likely you won't get a place to sit down. Anyways, if you're staying more then few days in Singapore, I think it's a thing worth doing! They also have dining-in-the sky service for two, and that would be definitely an amazing and romantic experience.",,,
,,Wonderful Height!! Higher than London Eye!!,5,,"Oh...its a very nice place to see the city after the Observation Desk on MBS. This is higher than London EYE, and I have been to London Eye as well. But must say, this one is better for a view of both the Sea and latest city that Singapore now is.

London Eye shows you how classy place London is however this shows how happening Singapore is.

Must Visit!!",,,
,,Nice but not a MUST go!,3,,"It costs $33, you can get cheaper alternative at the marina bay skypark only at $20 and u can still get the same amazing view of Singapore from top. and i think the flyer ride lasts for 30 minutes. souvenirs there are expensive.",,,
,,"One ride, multiple views of Singapore",5,,"This is a must do ! One ride and offers multiple views of the Singapore panorama , the docs , scyscrapers , gardens by the bay, quay, we also caught a chinese new parade by chance and were very delighted",,,
,,Good Experience,4,,"We had expected a fast merry-go-round ; but were surprised with one that was circling almost unnoticeably. The city at night is dazzling when viewed from the flyer at night. Other than that view, at the height it takes during the circlind, nothing spectacular",,,
,,165M High,3,,"Not bad to visit , compare to Taiwan 88m and Las Vegas 167m , it comes the 2nd tallest Ferris wheel in the world with 165m. Nice view to the garden by the bay .",,,
,,Good,4,,Visited Singapore flyer. It is around S$33 for one person. It is Airconditioned and it turns slowly. We can see singapore from top and it is really a pleasant sight. There are eating joints also and one can also shop a bit around the singapore flyer. Must visit in singapore.,,,
,,A must,5,,If you are in Singapore this is a must do!! The views are amazing! You can see everything. It was interesting seeing the many ships waiting to enter the port.,,,
,,Flying High,5,,"An attraction not to be missed. Brilliant views from this technological marvel. So big, so high and so safe. You can even sit down if you want. We went early evening and got daylight photos as well as the lights when they came on at dusk.
Absolutely Brilliant!",,,
,,What an experience,5,,"This was the first place we visited. One can get a view of rafels, sea and garden by the bay amongst other things from the flyer.. children loved it",,,
,,Over hyped,3,,"Though the structural size may instil excitement.. It's nothing more than a giant wheel ride or Ferris wheel ride..

No doubts that the panoramic view of the city is simply breathtaking when you reach the top of the wheel.. But that really takes ages to move..

I really wish I should not have gone for the ride..",,,
,,Top of the City,5,,"Its a ride of 30 minutes. Not crowded . Relax and watch. Sitting arrangement is there . You have ample time to take photograph. See the Singapore from one place. Nearby restaurants , travel agency and one flight simulators games are available.",,,
,,An expensive way to see the sights,4,,The ride lasts 30 minutes and for 33 Singapore Dollars each it is not worth the money. The Marina Bay Skypark is much better.,,,
,,Fantastic Views of Singapore,5,,"We highly recommend visiting the Singapore Flyer at night for fantastic views of the city lights and harbor lights, and the Super-tree Grove light show across the bay.",,,
,,Fly High in Singapore,4,,"I think this is really a must-do among Singapore's more recent attractions . I've been a regular and frequent visitor to Singapore over the past 35 years ( business , holidays or stop-overs) and I confess frankly to loving the place .
My partner and I ( a mature couple ) would recommend that the best way to take in the Singapore Flyer is to (A) go well after dark on a weekday , and (B) take the option that includes the Singapore Sling , if possible . Go on , spoil yourselves !
The bird's eye perspective that the Flyer allows during its slow rotation is made very much more striking when one can see the city lit up . It transforms a modern high-tech city into a high-tech fairy land city of lights . And , taking the Singapore Sling option does confer certain benefits . It feels a bit like flying Business Class . One feels pampered : Seated initially in a ''special'' lounge , being then guided with ceremony to the front of the queue for boarding , placed in a ''car'' that isn't packed with many others , and finally served with the drink you paid extra for . Sipping the Sling while wandering freely around the car to take in the 360 degree views available makes for a memorable experience . Enjoy !
This was our first time on the Flyer , but it's something everyone should experience , even if only once .",,,
,,A wonderful way to see Singapore,5,,A fantastic way to see Singapore - a magnificent city showcased on an awesome ride. A half an hour ride that goes by quickly. A must do in Singapore!,,,
,,Brilliant views,5,,"Although this attraction is quite expensive for a family, we really enjoyed the views. Before getting on the Flyer there is interactive display with information about how Singapore Flyer was built. We found this really interesting. We went early afternoon, I expect it would be quite impressive at night also with all the city lights.",,,
,,Great view,4,,U can see whole singapore from up there.nothing special but the view is great n all tourists must visit,,,
,,Excellent View of Singapore,5,,Absolutely loved experiencing the Singapore Flyer with its mesmerizing views of Singapore. Takes about 30mins for the round trip and it was well worth it!,,,
,,Great views,5,,A great ride for getting fabulous views across Singapore city. Reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend. It gives you a great starting point if you're not sure what you want to see and do during your stay.,,,
,,Great experience,5,,We enjoyed our ride on the flyer. Wonderful views over Singapore with great photo opportunities. Don't think I would bother again but glad we experienced it. Takes 30 mins to go around so moved very slowly.,,,
,,Fun,4,,"Had fun watching Singapore from above! It's nice and different to a lot of people but it's not a must, a lot of places in Singapore are better, but try it once it's DIFFERENT!",,,
,,Top view of Singapore,4,,"Best place to see Singapore from top. Safe, comfortable and relaxing ride. In each chamber around 20 person can accommodate.",,,
,,Amazing view,4,,I recommend you to this place at night. Its glorious view of Singapore. Tall buildings and lamps are shiny. You can see almost Singapore area from top of Singapore flyer,,,
,,Cant aviod if you are in Singapore,4,,Its like going to singapore is visiting flyer... I visited before lunch view was great... But there are annoying photographers they take your photo print it before you even ask them and ask you 50 dollars a piece... the ride itself costs less than 30...,,,
,,What a view!,5,,"I admit it isn't really cheap, but the Singapore Flyer is a wonderful experience! Of course everything there aims to make you buy any kind of souvenir, but the ride is awesome. You will never forget the views you get. An absolute must-see!",,,
,,overpriced 30min,3,,nothing much to see as it's just buildings and a small patch of sea... 30min seems very long and my wife and i can't wait to get out of it after the first 10min...,,,
,,Nothing much happening here. I'm LOCAL what do you EXPECT.,3,,Had a REASONABLY OK experience of the 6D (dimension) ride there. Did two of the rides there. Not as thrilling as expected. Not worth going for a second time but enough to kill time for the LONELY BORING GEEKS.,,,
,,Nice view. A bit overrated though,4,,"We were planning to go for this ride from a few years but only got a chance now. First the pros. The idea is creative. There are these horizontal drum like glass enclosed containers hung in a circular mode on a vertical wheel which rotates ever so slowly. So you get to stand with 30 other people who are madly taking aerial pictures of the city from this height. The cost of this ride is almost $100.
For us it as a bit of a come down, because Singapore being a high rise city, one gets aerial views from virtually every building and we were blessed to be on a high floor of a hotel so had these views daily. Yet,we got caught in the frenzy and took a hundred pictures over and over again with the others.
It was an ok experience, not to be done again and can easily be skipped unless one is deprived of aerial views where you live . Then it might be a sight worth seeing.",,,
,,Great View,5,,"I'm not sure which is the best, the Singapore Flyer on the Marnia Bay Skypark! Best if you visit both of them!!! One quick note, if the flew into Singapore on Singapore Airlines, be sure to bring your boarding pass to get a nice discount on The Flyer. In fact, keep that boarding pass in your pocket as several local attractions offer discounts when you show it.",,,
,,锟斤拷锟斤拷锟斤拷锟斤拷 Top 10 tourists Attractive Place in Singapore,5,,"If this is your first time to visit Singapore, don't miss this place. Nice view and good experience. Let's try馃槃馃憤馃徏",,,
,,Too expensive,3,,Expensive. Nothing much to see up there. a 45 minutes ride. Not interesting. Not worth to go. waste time,,,
,,BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF SINGAPORE,4,,"This flyer is a very comfortable as it moves very slowly & when you are on top gives a good view of the city & harbor area. One can easily take photographs at varying heights, cabins can be personalised for a large family.",,,
,,Visited Singapore Flyer with family of 4 - late Jan 16,4,,"Visited on a week day in Jan 16, we did not line up for long. Great view of Singapore, F1 track is directly below and you also have good view of Marina Sands and Gardens by the Bay. We departed the Flyer walked over the bridge, through the Marina Sands and onto the Gardens by the Bay.
One rotation takes 30 minutes, plenty of opportunity for pictures and time to take it all in.",,,
,,Take the VIP/Cocktail/Singapore sling package: Its completely worth your money,5,,"Not only did they reschedule my visit to the next day (when I called to cancel), they also ensured that my family had a great time and were treated just right.
We went for the premium cocktail package which comes with entry to Lounge, entry to restaurant, ride in private capsule (maybe it was just us that day) where you can play your own music and enjoy.

I personally love this one so much better over other Sight seeing things Singapore. This was complete Value for Money.
Only negative was being a vegetarian, there was nothing for us to eat except Subway during odd hours. That was a complete let down.
So if you are a vegetarian, bring your food or come full stomach because there isn't anything to eat here.",,,
,,Dull,3,,Pretty monontonous going round at a snails pace. Good view though and there is i believe a champagne tasting package which I would love to try next time,,,
,,Awesome view,4,,I enjoyed this more than anything else. You see the entire city in front of you. This is a replica of London eye. Must visit attraction when you are in Singapore.,,,
,,Great View of Singapore,5,,"This attraction will give you a great view of downtown Singapore. I was able to watch a kayaking event from the Flyer as a bonus. The ride was slow so even if I have a fear of heights, I never felt afraid. In fact I had a grand time taking pictures of the view and taking selfies inside the capsule. Even though the capsule can carry up to 28 people, the staff allowed only our group of 4 people in one capsule so we enjoyed the ride even more. Next time I will ride the Flyer at night for a different riding experience.",,,
,,Fancy and Beauty,5,,I couldn't believe this giant structure could be that much beautiful and enjoyable. From top of the flyer you could see Singapore and its wonders.,,,
,,Well worth a visit for the view,3,,"The Singapore Flyer offers spectacular views over central Singapore and Gardens By the Bay.

The waiting time can be extensive if you are there during peak season - but during our visit the wait was not to long.

Singapore has now introduce variable pricing for tourist attractions - there is local price and tourist price - don't get caught - for tourists the cost is $33 -no discount.

The views are well worth it - but the ride is over quickly. Gives a good overview of Singapore",,,
,,Needs a clear day....,4,,"Singapore equivalent to the London Eye. Sadly it began to rain during our visit and visibility was poor. However the Flyer is perfectly situated for great views over the port, marina, quays and city on a clear day.",,,
,,Love the scenery from the top!,4,,An icon of Singapore. The Singapore Flyer is worth a visit for every visitor visiting the small red dot of Singapore! The slow paced of the wheel makes the time more enjoyable to see the view around the tiny republic. Thumbs up!,,,
,,Amazing,5,,"The biggest Ferris wheel in the world, the pods are amazing, you can walk around or sit down, make sure you charge your camera or phone first so you can take loads of pictures of the beautiful city.",,,
,,Amazing Views!,5,,Easily accessible! Great Photo opportunity. Moves slow so you can get a great view of the Maria Bay area. Nice souvenir photo.,,,
,,Brilliant panoramic views,5,,We visited this attraction while on holiday and it is very well set out as you pass through the tunnels to the flyer. Also some shops for gifts and a food hawker market to get food and drinks if feeling peckish. I am not too keen on heights but this is brilliant for scenic photos of the city and harbour especially on a clear day and you go slow that you do not realise you are so high up. Would recommend this for anyone visiting to be on their to do list especially if you are a photography buff like my hubby.,,,
,,Amazing views !,5,,"Luckily there were no queues , and getting from Tckt to start was a LITTLE bit confusing , a fantastic thing to do . Amazing views of the city and the harbour and nearly on the same height at the boat on the top of the marina building .
Really lovely thing to do , and some fab stuff in the shop ( my companions bought lots of jewellery )",,,
,,Great Views,5,,"Same as London Eye but the time i went there was no queue was so ever and all the pods are air-conditioned, great way to see the city and you can see how far the small country of Singapore has come with the skyscrapers and view of the sky park and marina bay sands. recommend it.",,,
,,Slow paced but tall enough to enjoy,4,,"this giant wheel has capsules that can seat few people and is transparent for a clear view allround.
the ticket counter is on the ground floor. we had booked thru the website online so just had to show printout for exchange of tickets. went in the week day afternoon so it was not at all crowded.
u pass thru a interactive display regarding the flyer and a photo session in case if u want to buy it as a souvenir. tip- take your time and go slow let the people in front pass that way you increase your chances of getting a entire capsule for your family. worked for us but may not work if its more crowded.
its a 30 mins rotation. you can see the MBS, esplanade, merlion, the gardens by the bay, marina barrage, the F1 circuit the skyscrapers all at once.
plan well for the pictures as you pass from left to right so that u get well timed pics.",,,
,,Good to visit,4,,"Flyer is good to visit once specially in the evening as you can see the Singapore with lights. For evening tickets you need to pay little extra money. I suggest to buy tickets online and then buy as few shops provide online tickets with big discounts. Flyer moves very slowly and you are allowed only one round/circle. If you wish to spend more time in flyer, you can book your table and have dinner inside it.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"We went on as a Family (2 adults, 2 children - 17 & 14) and to be honest one of us was a little nervous. However once the nerves were under control it was a fantastic way to see Singapore. In the end the nervous one (me) felt very comfortable and I would highly recommend the Singapore Flyer. Great 360 degree views of Singapore. We all loved it.",,,
,,View Singapore from height!!,4,,"Worth to have full package trip Singapore. Flyer, Duck boat ride, etc. You can see the beauty of Singapore from different perspective both modern buildings as well as the old structures from British time which are kept as monuments. Great to take photos on top of you like taking photos.",,,
,,It's good but not much to see really,3,,"Arrived at the Flyer on Christmas Eve and it was closed due to bad weather. These things clearly can't be helped.
Ideally we would have hung around and waited for the weather to clear but there is nothing else there or nearby. Ended up getting a taxi back into town for lunch and trying again a few hours later.
When we arrived back we could see the wheel was turning and it was open again.
There were very little queues and our pod has about 12 people in it alogether which was good, not too busy.
This wheel is huge and you get nice views, but really there isn't much you can see that you can't see from a high floor in a hotel....
The weather wasn't great so maybe this restricted our view but I kind of doubt that.
This is probably a must do/one time thing.
I'm glad I done it, but if returning to Singapore I wouldn't feel the need to return here.
The wheel looks lovely lit up at night and I think a night time visit would probably be better than a daytime one as the city is lovely at night.",,,
,,Exploring Singapore,4,,"Having done the London eye and a few other city Ferris wheels I was intrigued to go on the Singapore eye. It was overall a good experience with the views from the flyer being as good as expected, and there was virtually no queuing. I think our timing was good as well as we saw the lights of the city coming on as we went around. However, we felt it was a bit pricey and certainly the long wait for the photos was not great.",,,
,,Lovely views,4,,This attraction was part of our Singapore Stopover so was worth a visit not sure if we would have paid to go as quite expensive and not to dissimilar to the London Eye but views were lovely. Think a night time visit would have pretty spectacular though,,,
,,"A Feast for the Eyes, Bonanza of Technology Details",5,,"The Singapore Flyer provides an Amazing Moving Ariel Spectacle of the Beautiful Marine Bay Area. A ride after Sunset gives the Added Thrill of watching Singapore covered with millions of Lights. The 165m Tall Singapore Flyer is the Largest in the World, with the Ride taking about 40mins. Before the Ride, the Visitor is provided Detailed Technology & Structural Information about the Unique Design of the Singapore Flyer. Couched in Layman Terms & Presented in Participative Displays, the Visitor is explained the One-of-its-Kind Innovations which allow Minimum Power to be consumed in Driving the Singapore Flyer which is the Lightest Inspite of being the Largest in the World. Each Compartment is Spacious & provides ample Seating & Walking space to have 360-degree Views at all times as you Move Majestically around the Huge Flyer.",,,
,,Dinner package,3,,A ride on the flyer is a must for a visit to Singapore. However the dinner flight simply is poor value for money. Only free drink offered with an elaborately advertised 4 course meal is water and instant coffee. The hot part of the meal was just below Luke warm. Thumbs down.,,,
,,view of the city from the top,4,,"Although this is not the highest view in the city, but you can view all around within the cabin. Different time of the day offer different views, day / sun set / night / F1 race nights / fire works.",,,
,,Wow!!!!!,5,,"Excellent experience. For anyone who has a fear of heights, HAVE NO FEAR. It felt like you were on the top floor of a hotel room, looking out the window. Each cabin is very spacious and the rotation is extremely slow. Excellent photo opportunity. The best photos we took all week!!!! Highly recommended.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"Its highly recommended for family with children to get a bird's eve view of Singapore. You may feel that the price is a bit expensive, but all together you will be satisfied.",,,
,,a new experience to me :),5,,it was a wonderful ride .you can see a lot of the city through it .very organised and clean.i would advise it for all singapore travellers especially who would have short stay there.,,,
,,Expected it to be higher,3,,"We visited as a family of twelve.

The flier movement is so slow that you hardly notice.
Takes aroun 1 hr to visit and exit attraction

Likes
Panaromic view
More privacy, as each deck can be taken up by a family.

Dislikes
The marine bay sands hotel deck stands much higher and so the view should be even more fantastic. We did not visit that as we chose the flier. But perhaps we should have gone to there?",,,
,,Fantastic views and a long ride,5,,"We came on a rainy day but were still treated to some spectacular views out over the harbour, the city, and the Gardens by the Bay. We were able to get on for free as part of a Singapore Airlines stopover package (SIA Attractions card). We came first thing in the morning and had a very short wait but it is clear that they have long lines at times as there was plenty of space for queues.

It was a relatively long ride, about half an hour if I remember correctly. Each car has bench seats in the middle or you can stand around the outside of the car to look out the windows. I think it said each car can take up to 22 people, but we only had about ten in ours. I really would not like to be here during peak times.",,,
,,Worthwhile Attraction,4,,"Well organised and run, this is a great way to start a trip to Singapore and orientate yourself . It takes about 40 minutes all told and I recommend doing it early in the day when the air is typically clearest.",,,
,,Amazing,4,,Wonderful experience. It will be better if you go at night. You will be able to see the beautiful night scene of Singapore. Worth a ride for at least one time.,,,
,,must try it,5,,the cost of ticket is 25$you can see the city from it i am afraid of heights but its was ok and i really enjoyed the view .,,,
,,Good way to see the city,3,,"Tickets purchased on site, have read that they are cheaper on line but we didn't have internet during stay in Singapore. Went during the day, it was great to see the city. However, there is no guide available so it's just a case of looking but not knowing what you are looking at. Would have liked to take the trip at night as I think seeing the city lit up would have been an enjoyable experience",,,
,,singapore flyer same as londons eye,5,,here are very fantastic and amazing.night seeing is very beautiful than days.i love there.you can go there with MRT.i recommend to everybody witch go to singapor they shoud go to singapor flyer.,,,
,,Beautiful view,4,,Despite being a little bit expensive we enjoyed the ride and took beautiful pictures going up and coming down.,,,
,,Great Views of the City/State,5,,Last visit to Singapore we had not gone to the Flyer but with a perfect day weather wise we couldn't resist this time. The one rotation gives plenty of time to take in all the sights and snap many photos. The cars are cool and comfortable.,,,
,,Great views,5,,The wheel is very big and the views are great..the slowness of the turn gives you ample time to take great pictures,,,
,,Good location to view Singapore,4,,"Although we could see the flyer we found it a little difficult to get to is due to all the remaining Formula 1 race structures remaining. Once we arrived there was no waiting after purchase of the tickets. There was only 4 of us in the pod so we were able to move around at will to view and take photos. Uninterrupted views out to sea as well as part of the city, the Marina Bay area and surrounding areas. Not as good as it may have been the day we went due to the smoke at the time drifting from in Indonesia fires but still recommended as a great place to view Singapore as a tourist.",,,
,,Amazing view of Singapore city,4,,"I was in a confusion to go to Marina Sands Sky deck or SG flyer....then I decided to boar the giant wheel..I booked tickets through my hotel ..took a bicycle gf or rent from my hostel... Then I went to the bay of the SG flyer...its a giant Wheel with amazing engineering design...the cubicles r air-conditioned after security chet we were escorted and were made to board the flyer which is non stop and was rotating...at a gradual slow pace, the staff opened the door and I boarded the cubicle and alighted it...first I was amazed to ve the glimpse of the racing F1 track , Marina barrage , Marina Sands tower , esplanade, Marina bay SG icon merlion Fullerton hotel, and the tall rise buildings, the rotation of the wheel was in slo pace and so I clicked several photos , an audio guide is played in the cubicle....after 25 mins of the rotation time I got down..its expensive an a pocket killer for a budget traveller like me..but I ventured it.....nice experience...",,,
,,Breathtaking ride of Singapore,4,,Flyer takes about 40 minute to complete the trip. You can sit and admire entire Singapore. When it reaches to the top you can pretty much see entire Waterfront and beautiful ocean view. Price is a bit expensive but if you are travelling you should go.,,,
,,High view of a Singapore,4,,"Our travelling group of 9 enjoyed the 'Singapore Sling' experience of the Singapore Flyer-easy online bookin experience; the views & drink were great, but as a visitor to Singapore, I think there should have been an explanatory pamphlet/brochure, or an audio commentary pointing out the highlights & attractions visible on the ride.
Very smooth & not scary for those who may not consider this option if they are afraid of heights.",,,
,,Awesome view,5,,Best time to ride is in the night. With little queue you will not have to wait longer. Take your seat and have look at the bustling metropolis from the top. There are options for dining as well as drinking but obviously at higher cost.,,,
,,Another Must visit in Singapore,5,,"360' view of the city, at a languid and unperturbed pace. Singapore flyer is a must in the itinerary!",,,
,,"Awesome views, very different from day to night",5,,"Done it twice, no or very short lines, comfortable air conditioned cabins, you can usually get one to yourself, depending on the queue. Better pictures taken during the day, at night the smudges on the glass made them appear out of focus",,,
,,Up in the Sky,5,,Its just beautiful to sit on the flyer and view the Singapore Skyline. I visited with a bunch of friends and had a quality time there.,,,
,,A must do!,4,,"We love it here and have been here twice on different stays in Singapore. You get an incredible view of essentially the whole country. Would definitely recommend you do it at night as you get less crowds and get to see Singapore at night, watch the light show at the gardens, see the lights of the city reflecting on the water and see the hustle bustle of Singapore at night.",,,
,,In the Clouds,5,,Expensive but really is worth every dollar. The pods are very large so your views are all round and truly fantastic.,,,
,,lights all around,4,,great view on Singapore flooded with lights ... extraordinary when you are all alone with loved one and all this lights :D ...,,,
,,Do it - just to say you've done it..,3,,"It's a good experience and certainly allows you to get some rather spectacular views across Singapore City, but for the price of entry and the often muddled and large queues it may be worth a second thought if you are already in two minds about going. Lift booths are often filled over-capacity for seating, so be prepared to stand for the duration of the ride (about 35minutes). If you're weary of heights, you'll be in for a few nervous stares downwards, but it's certainly nothing too nerve-racking.

Singapore is often described as a great city of lights, so to that accord - suggest going later in the evening to really understand why it gets its well deserving name.",,,
,,One of the best thing Flyers making singapore looks more attractive,4,,You gonna be feel like you're in London. Lol :D all i mean to say Singapore Flyers gives you sweet looks of it in night as all lights are just making your look perfect around from Marina Bay. I often visit here with my family and friends. One of the best thing ever need to do if you're in Singapore. Enjoy,,,
,,Magnificent,5,,"The experience begins with the pre travel exhibition. One part is interactive with a quiz on the Flyer its design and construction. The visitor is then shown various exhibits, scale models as an orientation for the tour. Ideal time to start the adventure is around 5 p.m. and then one can appreciate, dusk, lighting up, setting sun and the city under colourful lights. A visit not to be missed.",,,
,,Great serene place,5,,"As it got quieter with locals, it is easier for us to get a capsule with lesser or nobody else inside for us to have our couple time.",,,
,,Beautiful night view,5,,You can see the cityscape from Singapore Flyer and it is both romantic and pleasant sight from sky above. A must go during night time!,,,
,,mesmerising view of the Bay area,5,,Go in the evening to savor the lit up Bay area. On one end you have downtown Singapore while the supertrees mark the Gardens by the Bay distinctly.,,,
,,Great views.,5,,Stayed at the nearby Marina Bay Sands and our room overlooked the flyer so was a must visit for us a was just a walk from the hotel. Had the pod to ourselves which was great. Very reminiscent of the London Eye. Lovely smooth ride and even though it was raining when we were on the views from the top were great.,,,
,,A must,5,,"A round on this Giant Wheel takes about half an hour, but it is amazing. It is one of the attractions of Singapore. Please do carry your cameras to take the pics of the lovely surrounding",,,
,,Fantastic view,4,,"We had a fine tour in the Flyer but would have appreciated a small flyer, pointing out remarkable buildings and other sights in the area. As a foreigner you don't have access to the net to give you the informations.",,,
,,beautiful,5,,Really great experience. I recommend the Flyer for visitors who would like to see the best views of Singapore all at once.,,,
,,Superb Views!!,5,,We went in the early afternoon so the lines to get on were negligible. We shared our ride with two other families but even so we had plenty of room to move about and take pictures from every angle we wanted. The ride was smooth and I could only sense a small amount of motion. The view was spectacular from every angle. Getting on and off was also very smooth but could be a challenge for disabled individuals. There were two assistants to assist with the boarding that helped those who needed it.,,,
,,Have to ride this for at least once in your lifetime!,5,,Great view towards the whole Singapore all the way to Sentosa island! Interesting to see all different parts of Singapore from up above!,,,
,,A must do - day or night,5,,"We weren't sure about the experience seeing things high up at moving at, what seems like, a snail's pace. But this was a great experience - and a must do. Granted that this was include in our Singapore Explorer pass from SIA, but it was worth the trip. Also redeem your pass allowance at the Singapore Street Fair at the bottom of the flyer - great food and drinks to be had.",,,
,,Fantastic Views,5,,"I stopped by and expected some nice views, but the views were more spectacular than I thought they would be. The view of the harbor, the multitude of ships at sea, and the cityscapes was well worth the trip. I would do this again if I come back.",,,
,,"Fantastic views, well worth the ride",5,,"Ordered the vouchers for the tickets online. Glad we went on this ride. The views were stunning looking out to the South China Sea where we could see ships and boats, We could also see the beautiful landscape of the mainland. We went on the ride around 6 PM. The ride takes about 30 minutes. So we were able to see Singapore and its vicinity in daylight and also at dusk when the lights were switched on across the sea and the landscape.

I have been on the London Eye which looks across the Thames river and was unique; and so is the Singapore Flyer unique in its own way.",,,
,,Amazing view of Singapore,5,,"After we checked in the hotel, this was the first attraction we decided to experience. We took a taxi from the hotel and the fare was not too expensive. Before you can hop on the Singapore flyer, there's a museum like area you have to go through and once at the entrance of the flyer, we joined the queue. The flyer does not stop its rotation to pick up passengers. It's slow rotation is enough to safely hop on the flyer without injuring yourself. I can barely feel it moving so no dizzy spells for me. We were with 6 other people in the capsule and the view was magnificent. We went there at night and the Singapore skyline was vibrant and full of color. Absolutely beautiful. We took photos from every angle. It was a good start to our Singapore vacation.",,,
,,Incredible!,5,,"Absolutely beautiful. The Singapore skyline is incredible to see. I would highly recommend going at night to see the lights! The ride itself is very smooth, and there are benches in the middle of the cars so you can sit if you get woozy with the heights. The ticket price is a little bit expensive, but there is no other way to see all of Singapore in my opinion. Definitely a great attraction!",,,
,,"Waste of time, waste of money",1,,"We went on the last ride on 26/12. It was just a big wheel moving very slow (1 circle for around 30mins) nothing impressed, after 10mins we regretted to come. Didn't see any happy face when finished.",,,
,,Spectacular Views,5,,"Went on the Singapore Flyer at 6:PM still light enough to see everything but also beautiful when the lights started to come on, the views were beautiful, would totally recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore.",,,
,,Top attraction - bad timing,5,,"We were almost able to see the sights of Singapore from, the Flyer, making it worthwhile - well organised and easy to board and disembark - we were there in October 2015 and in the middle of the what seems to be now an annual experience - that is of illegal or badly managed bushfires and crop burning off in Indonesia - mostly Kalimantan and Sabah - the city was blanketed from this smoke which originated some 600 kilometres away and affected six countries - they closed the primary schools for several weeks in Singapore but our tour operator and the Sea Princess Cruise Line did not make us aware of this environmental nightmare. A warning to 2016 visitors from about October to November - don't go.... unless you are a heavy smoker...",,,
,,Aerial view of SIngapore through .....SIngapore Flyer,5,,"I have been seeing this flyer in all pix of Singapore. It was dream come true for me to go to SIngapore flyer.
An amazing experience. No doubt one should go in night. The view and lights makes your experience more memorable. You can see all Singapore by being on this flyer.",,,
,,Fantastic View,5,,"Billed as the highest ferris wheel in the world, the 360 degree views of Singapore are jaw dropping. We rode the Flyer at night and saw the lights of the city including the Gardens By the Bay. Each compartment comfortably holds 30 people and the 30 minute orbit goes by quickly.",,,
,,Must try at least once,5,,"Pros :
+ its a giant ferris wheel
(2nd biggest in the world, only lost by 2.6m)
+ experience of life time, must visit at least once
+ having been during noon and evening, one could strongly suggest the evening view is much better

Cons :
- no MRT direct access (yet)

Traveler Tips :
* a taxi driver suggested that marina sands bay is better, because it doesn't limit how long you stay, and cheaper ticket too.
But personally i would still strongly suggest to try this first.
* for obvious reason, not good for people who are afraid of height",,,
,,Romance is in the air,4,,"My recommendation for this one is to invite your partner on a dinner date. Save it for a special occasion. They offer a special dinner service and the cost is not sit significantly greater, given the cost of a meal, the exclusivity and the service etc. basically your pod will consist of about four tables max so it's fairly limited. I suggest going a little bit before sunset so you get the best of the day and night view.. There will eat one.course per rotation and they take about 30-40mins. Biggest tip is don't drink to much and go to the toilet before you go up even if u feel you don't need to. There is obviously not toilet on the flyer.",,,
,,Amazing views over Marina Bay and Singapore,5,,We went just before dusk and so got to see everything in daylight as well as when the lights were coming on,,,
,,Loved the views!,5,,"I have never been in such a giant Ferris wheel so this was a cool activity. Price is S$33 and the duration is probably 20 minutes. Great views of the harbor and city, so super photo ops. I would recommend doing this at least once when visiting Singapore.",,,
,,Great Views,4,,We visited this in the evening and found the views to be brilliant. Although it stops frequently the pods were a good size and didn't feel crowded. They were clean and had plenty of seating.,,,
,,Great views,4,,A $33 ticket gives you 40 minutes with great views over Singapore and (on clear days) over the sea to Malaysia. Plenty of roof top bars also give this view but I thought it was worth the trip.,,,
,,"Not value for money, only good for photo opportunity",2,,"Kids were very excited then as soon as we got on excitement turn to boredom.
Good view but it didn't do much for us, their family is for 2+1 but we are a family of 5 but we didn't mind paying AUD $150. Sadly we were quite disappointed
There isn't much to do around the area for the kids so after a boring ride it's time to go back to our hotel.
In comparison to MOA eye area (Phils) where there were quite a lot of things to do and is suitable for all ages.",,,
,,Nice exprnc,5,,D earlier day v couldnt board cz f rains.. I was just praying dat v get d chance next day.. N yeah.. God listened to our prayers .. Amazing exprnc...,,,
,,Amazing,5,,"This attractions is absolutely amazing, based 165m off the ground at its highest point, meaning the 360 degree views are amazing for photography or just pleasurable veiwing. Although slightly slow it meant more time to enjoy the panoramic views of this gorgeous city, although young children (under 6) may be bored, but they still will enjoy it. Overall, I suggest you go right now, and you won't have to wait Ina line if you want to",,,
,,Having Singapore Sling on Singapore Flyer,4,,"You can't get more Singapore than that! We booked the 6.30 flight which we get an amazing sunset view of Singapore. It's overlooking the F1 track, Gardens by the bay area & Marina Bay Sands.

You get a clear view of the city skyline while taking a sip of their famous Singapore sling, that's truly a remarkable feeling, well at least for me :)

Full circle takes 30 minutes and we had a big group so we were ushered to the VIP lounge while waiting for our flight. U get a nice view of the MBS tower from the lounge. Truly enjoyed my experience.",,,
,,Fun way to see city,4,,"My party of three (2 adults and 1 child) booked the Singapore Fling flight. This is where you are put into a special car with a bar and are given Singapore Flings to drink. Non-alcoholic versions are available for underage drinkers. Booking this flight is more expensive than the regular trip but well worth it. There are limited number of people allowed in a car and you are treated like a VIP. You arrive at the complex are are sent to the concierge room and are escorted to your special car. The Singapore Fling is really tasty. We all enjoyed our drinks. The Flyer is set up in a feng shui way. You start out with views of the water which is viewed as prosperous. End with views of the financial district which is the result of the prosperity. You get views of the stadium, Marina Bay, skyscrapers, ships, and Gardens by the Bay. Trip takes around 30-40 mins. Great way to see the city and relax with a drink.",,,
,,Simply amazing,5,,We took the Singapore Flyer at 11pm on New Year's Eve. There were no queues or crowds and we had 7 of us including children and an infant. The views were breath-taking and the whole ride magical. Strongly recommend the Flyer by night. It was included in our SIA Holiday Stop Over and accessible by the SIA Hop On bus.,,,
,,Its ok,3,,"Its meant to be one of the biggest attractions of its type in the world. The only issue is there is not that much to look at in Singapore really, fun experience though not as good as the London Eye.",,,
,,First time experience in such flyer,5,,"It was my first time experience in such flyer, even for my family. Worth event, Gives us a full view of Singapore and near by location. It was safe and slow so no fear of the height even it takes to too height. Had good fun. Thanks.",,,
,,Great view of the city,5,,"Well worth the money. Gives a great view of Singapore without the fear of heights. Glass enclosure offers panoramic views of marina bay, the gardens, the F1 racetrack..etc",,,
,,Excellent views,5,,I was a bit wary taking this trip on the singapore flyer but it was absolutely stunning. We done the trip at night and the night sky over singapore was breath taking. Easy to get on and off and great value for money. Would recommend this trip for anyone visiting singapore. Seating is available in each pod but to get the best photos you need to be standing which is quite safe,,,
,,Amazing !!,5,,"We just thought that going on a Ferris wheel would be boring, how wrong were we, WOW !!!. The whole process from going through security quickly airport style, ( yes it's necessary this day and age ), to understanding the engineering masterpiece via interactive video shows was mind boggling. Then the actual ride in a capsule up to 500 feet !!. Photo opportunities every minute . The Marina Bay Sands Hotel dominating the skyline opposite, views of Singapore Harbour, the golf course, business district and much more. Ride lasts for 30 minutes for about 拢15 per adult. Fred from Liverpool. Jan 2016.",,,
,,No Movement Felt - too slow,2,,"Unless u want to get good photos shot from this flyer, don't bother. It's not like any big wheel ride I have ever tried. No feeling that the vehicle is moving and the entire cycle can take about 45 minutes to complete.....",,,
,,Nice view ... but probably overpriced,3,,"This is a nice activity to do whilst in Singapore, but to be honest it is on the expensive side for a family. I am glad we did it, but is probaby not great value for money. Ride takes about 40 mins I think.",,,
,,Stunning and Romantic Vibe around SG Flyer,3,,"Location : Raffles Avenue, Singapore
Rate : 8/10
Admission ticket : SGD 33 (adult), SGD 21 (child)

Like the tagline, 鈥渁 moving experience on every turn鈥? yes, this giant Ferris Wheel really give you lots of experiences when you are inside the capsule.

How to get there?
The easiest way is by MRT, stop at Promenade Station (Circle Line). From there, you just need to walk around 5 minutes and you can reach Singapore Flyer.

I always have a thing for a Ferris Wheel, don鈥檛 know why but it鈥檚 always so nice to see the giant wheel moving slowly, especially when it鈥檚 nighttime when you can see the wheel turning as the sky getting darker. Okay maybe I start to sound a lil poetic here :p

So, I decided to hop inside this capsule on January 2nd, 2016. FYI, the opening hours is 8.30 a.m 鈥?10.30 p.m. There are 28 capsules and one capsule can fit to 28 passangers in one time. You will be inside the capsule for around 30 minutes. I need to Q to get to the capsule maybe because it鈥檚 weekend and New Year鈥檚 vibe is still on :D

So, I may say night time is the best time to ride the capsule as you can see the nightview of Singapore. Maybe you think you鈥檒l afraid of the height, but if you really do enjoy the spectacular view, you would hardly know you were moving. From the capsule, you can see some attractive places like Merlion Park, The Fullerton Bay, Esplanade, Singapore River, Marina Bay Sands, The Helix Bridge, Youth Olympic Park, F1 Circuit, and many more. The view is stunning, amazing, and breathtaking.

You can ride the capsule with your family, friends, but the best is with your partner of course. When you鈥檙e inside the capsule, you can feel the romantic vibe all around you. And there鈥檚 a myth saying that if you both kiss when the capsule reach the top, both you and your partner will live happily forever. Haha I know it may sounds clich茅, but there鈥檚 no harm trying :p

You can also get your own capsule and get a premium sky dining with your partner. It鈥檚 also a good place to celebrate your anniversary or to propose your girlfriend.

So, what鈥檚 your experience being on Singapore Flyer?",,,
,,"Worth doing, day or night, or both!",5,,"The view was amazing. We went during the day as we have been around the area and seen a lot of the night lights already. On saying this, I think both have their benefits, so if you can do both, do it!",,,
,,Great views,4,,"This is a must when visiting Singapore, great views and friendly staff. Down side was the scratches on windows caused by vandals. There should be action to make them pay if they vandalise a window.",,,
,,Not as good as expected,2,,"The capsules are nice and of course the view is great but doing one round seems to take forever and it is quite pricey. At $33 per adult it seems a bit meh.

You can get a great view from a place like Level 33 or 1 Altitude but have freedom to move around more and have a drink or use a bathroom.

I think children will enjoy this attraction and if you want to go try and head there to catch sunset on the way up and night lights on the way down. From probably around 6:50 - 7:20pm as this is roughly sunset in Singapore.

Overall it was clean and neat inside the capsule but would not do it again.",,,
,,Nice to try,4,,"Nice to try when you can see all Singapore from the top . I was told 30 min but I would leave at least one hr to enjoy the museum before.
Buy the ticket as a package with place you want to see. Include night tour. Good news for the kids at the school.",,,
,,Nice view from the top...but pain from my pocket,4,,"The 30 mins ride might be costly. However, when the flyer brings you to the top you will get to see the skyline of Singapore. From the top, you can get to see the Gardens by the Bay, MBS etc.",,,
,,More fun than expected.,4,,"Yes, it's really expensive. But it's definitely an amazing view and a good way to see all of Singapore! It's something to do once if you have the time and money for sure. There's also this little museum thing before it that is kind of fun to look through before going into the wheel. Enjoyed it more than I thought I would.",,,
,,Wonderful Views!,5,,"For a beautiful view of the entire city, this is the perfect opportunity to see the beautiful city of Singapore in 30 minutes.",,,
,,Nice view,5,,The Singapore flyer is a great way to see the city. The queue didn't take long to get on. Well worth the money.,,,
,,Wow,5,,Another must for Singapore get to see this amazing city close up plus look down on the Singapore formula one circuit very cheap ticket price we went peak times and never waited to ride on the wheel,,,
,,A nice 'birds eye view' during the day and the night -,4,,"I have done the FLYER both during the day and night and enjoyed both rides. You will see much of the downtown city with the birds eye. Not cheap, but worth doing!!",,,
,,Room with a view,4,,"This is a great way to view the sights and lights of Singapore. The compartments are spacious, spotlessly clean (like everything in Singapore) and you would not know that you are spinning in mid-air.",,,
,,Beautiful siggts,5,,"We took the Singapore Flyer last night at about 9pm. We were able to quickly buy tickets and go through to a capsule without waiting. The capsules are huge and spacious and glass all around except the ceiling and floor so you don't get vertigo. The sights are really beautiful and it ALMOST goes as high as the Marina Bay Sands, but not quite. Worth going to, to tick off your tourist list.",,,
,,Superb view!,5,,"This is a not to missed attraction. Very well managed, they take utmost care of safety and never put too many people in one capsule! The views are splendid & well explained in each capsule!",,,
,,Amazing Experience !!,5,,"I visited Singapore Flyer during December 2015 with family. I was expecting a normal ride which we normally experience at different places. But when ride was taken, the experience was thrilling. Amount of height it takes you too is not countable. There are 28 cabins and few has dining facilities too.",,,
,,Nice view,4,,"Good view but a bit too expensive for 1 person, I personally went at night and found the view amazing, would recommend going during the day as it would be less crowded.",,,
,,"Average flyer ,Not much tourist here",3,,Flyer location is good if view is clear. Generally it is cloudy and no good view. Ticket cost is quite high. If u really want to visit then must visit at the sunset time only.,,,
,,Only if U like Ferris wheels,3,,"It's exactly the same concept as the London eye, not worth it for $30, as you only get to spend 30 minute there. I would suggest rather going to the rooftop bars to get a better view for a longer time.",,,
,,good for kids and family,3,,visited with family and friends. Kids love it. Spectacular view. If you visti also the area (swimming pool of Marina BAy and the Gardens) it is a natural completion.,,,
,,An awesome view.,5,,A must whilst in Singapore. The view of Singapore is worth seeing from this amazing structure. A great mall with plenty of dining areas. A must do if in Singapore.,,,
,,See All,5,,"One place to see all interesting place @ city. Use black sunglases when sunny day. For better view,choose evening between 5 ` 7 p.m.",,,
,,Great view!,4,,"Well worth the view. Very stable, a/con comfort. We went as a couple in the afternoon and had the capsule to ourselves. Would be lovely at sunset/early evening. Cost $33pp.",,,
,,"Good value, not too scary",5,,Entry was $33S which I thought was pretty good. It was not busy when we were there & I would be concerned if the maximum number of passengers were in each capsule. I have a fear of heights but felt happy( well maybe not happy but OK) enough sitting on the bench & as there were only about 10 people in the capsule I still got a great view.This is something everyone of all ages can enjoy,,,
,,Once But Not Twice,3,,"It is a must try for tourists but my point of view is: you tried it once and it's enough. Amazing view alright, but that's it.",,,
,,View from the top,4,,The entire Singapore city can be viewed during the 30 minute ride on this.. a bit overpriced for SGD 33.,,,
,,Not great,2,,This is an expensive way to get a view of the city. Try any of the hotels in the city ad buy a drink on the roof bar and it won't cost as much.,,,
,,The Flyer,4,,"At the base of the Singapore Flyer is a Food Court, their Roasted Pork as they say, is to die for. Now back to the Flyer, it was a nice experience ...",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"I like the place, at base of the Flyer is the gastronomic delights of Singapore, i especially liked their Roasted Pork. Now, going back to the Flyer, from there, you could see the wonderful Singapore, like the Gardens by the Bay, Open Stadium, and on a clear day, you will see Malaysia'",,,
,,Good for one time go,3,,You might like it if you like to click pictures from height. But there are better places to do so. It takes 30 min to complete full circle. I find it little boring.,,,
,,"All ups, no downs",5,,"Walking out of the Promenade MRT Station, the Singapore Flyer is easily visible. After a short walk you arrive at the base - where we were able to buy tickets without any trouble or queue at all (however we were there at 10am on a workday). Making our way up to the third floor, our tickets were checked and we walked through the Dreams exhibition which wasn't very interesting to us, however other people may find it enjoyable for a little read. Finally we got to the area where you get into the pods. The queue was nonexistent and after a wait of less than 5 minutes we were into one and commencing our 'flight' above the city. We were accompanied by only two other tourists, so the pod was nice and quiet for us to enjoy the views, which were indeed spectacular. Overall, it was definitely worth the money and I recommend it to anyone who wants to get a birds eye view of an amazing city. Some people may say that going at dusk or at night is pretty, but Goin during the day means you are able to actually see the landscape around you!",,,
,,great way to see singapore,5,,fantastic way to see singapore. the 30minute ride will allow you to see the sights and buildings of singapore.,,,
,,Stunning View 360,5,,"This is my 2nd time on the Singapore Flyer and I still love it as much as the first time.

The view is different day and night. And there are so many things to see - on my side, there is the business district with the nice and seemly powerful tall buildings. On the other - there is Gardens by the Bay. Looks really pretty when you are looking at it from high up.

Turn around to the corner and you see the Benjamin Shears high bridge and look further, there is the uniquely shaped National stadium. Look down and you see part of the F1 night race track. Beautiful 360 and lots of pictures to take. Must visit!",,,
,,Easy and best way to see the Singapore from top,5,,"It was my first experience in a Flyer like this. The cabins were air conditioned and spacious. Not much queue when we visited. The cabin was moving very slowly so you wont have any motion sickness. View from the cabin was beautiful and could see even the neighboring countries. View of the other high rise buildings, Harbor and the Ships in the harbor were also very nice.

A must experience attraction in Singapore.",,,
,,Panoramic harbour view,4,,"The wheel itself is a work of art, like a giant bicycle spoke wheel. It turns slowly allowing lots of time for photos and viewing. Best time is sunset.",,,
,,Great view of the city,4,,"The flyer continuously rotates at a very slow speed, so you have to hop on while it's moving. Maybe not recommended if you have walking difficulties. All up it takes about 30 minutes. The capsule is very sturdy and feels safe. It has quite a bit of room in the capsule. We hopped on at sunset, unfortunately it was overcast so we didn't see the sun set. We just saw an overcast Singapore as we came up, and nighttime Singapore as we went down. Not sure what a sunny Singapore would look like, but nighttime Singapore looks amazing in the flyer.",,,
,,Great View of Singapore Sky,5,,Although the queue was long. It was worth the wait. We took the flyer at evening and it was so beautiful to see the whole of Singapore for atop the flyer. Place was clean and staff was friendly.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Awesome place to visit with family. Excellent views of Singapore from the flyer and a must see place for every traveller visiting Singapore.,,,
,,Breathtaking View <3,5,,It is the best way to familiarize yourself with the city. I literally felt on top of the world. I recommend taking a ride around sunset. The ride would be around 30 min.,,,
,,You Just Have to Do It,4,,"Even on a dreary, rainy night it was an experience, as the views over the city were good. It is located right next to the Grand Prix pits, has great views of the Gardens by the Bay, the Sands hotel, the financial district etc. On a par with the Eye in London, nice gondolas and an efficient boarding system. If you only have a short visit, it could be missed if you've done one before.",,,
,,Excellent view,5,,The ride of the flyer might be costly but its worth every dollar spend. The flyer appears to be standstill from a distance but once you experience the ride you get how huge the flyer is.,,,
,,Amazing views over the whole of Singapore,5,,"I went up in the Singapore Flyer one morning. The pods are clean and modern and large.

I shared the pod with two couples who each had two children. There was plenty of room for us all to walk around and sit down. The sides are made of glass so you get a really good view.

The pod moves so slowly that you hardly feel any movement.

There are fantastic views over the whole of Singapore so you see things that you wouldn't normally see.

I had a photo taken which they put onto a background you can choose, but then at the end of the ride you have to queue to pick it up. the photo wasn't good quality and the wait was very long. Not worth the money. Take you own photo!",,,
,,Amazing,5,,We did a champagne fly and had a whole cabin for us. Very extraordinary with a great view and worth the money.,,,
,,Nice experience,5,,"I visited during day time, It is a great place to get the view of whole Singapore and its amazing skyline. the pace is slow and it will take around 30- 45 minutes to complete a full round. You don't even realize you are moving. The views are beautiful.",,,
,,Easy way to have a good view of the city,4,,"The ride is not very long, <30 minutes and it moves quite slow so you won't get motion sickness or lose any views. At the top you can see the whole ""Gardens by the Bay"" area along with the Marina Sands hotel.",,,
,,Go @ night,4,,"I strongly recommend to go at night but I'm sure it's also great by day
Well run as is everything in Singapore
We pre purchased the tickets on website to avid Q's but on the night in question that we visited there were no Q's
Stunning views in a safe environment",,,
,,Good Experience,4,,It was nice experience to see the city at night on Jan 1. Try and visit the flyer when the skies are clear for a better view of the city. Excellent view of the marina. Eating options are limited for a vegetarian with just a Subway restaurant. Short walk to Marina Bay Sands after you are done with the flyer.,,,
,,A great way to start your Singapore holiday - with an orientation view,5,,"Downtown on the MRT to the Flyer to take in the view encompassing East Coast Parkway, Singapore River, Sentosa Island and Marina Bay Gardens. Have visited Singapore several times and the city keeps on changing. Good photo opportunities. Once you've finished you can head down stairs to the Hop on Hop off city bus tours or walk or use the MRT (Promenade Station about 800m away) to head over to Marina Bay Sands for shopping, a bite to eat or proceed to the Marina Bay Gardens.",,,
,,Great Views of the city,5,,"Fantastic experience - we booked the Champagne trip and had a great pod with music, Fantastic views of the city. Highly recommended. Well worth the money",,,
,,Fantastic Experience,5,,"We pre booked a Champagne Flight for 7pm (sunset). Being pre booked you get to wait in the lounge and have your own escort to take you to the capsule, meaning no queuing.
There is a dedicated Champagne Capsule and it was so lucky for us that we were the only couple booked for 7pm, meaning we had the whole Capsule to ourselves. It was fabulous.
The 30 minute journey offered some lovely views, in the dusk going up and the dark coming back down. Definitely recommend and probably our best experience in Singapore (and that is saying something).",,,
,,Great,5,,"Really amazing il never done. You see Marina Bay Sand, Garden by the Bay. You can take lot of picture. Really fun.",,,
,,An awesome experience,5,,If one can get this flyer excursion included in a package - take it! The 'container' takes 28 people and the revolution lasts approx. 30 minutes. Make sure you clean the window in front of you when you reach the summit as the pictures will be blurred. To do the flyer at night is wonderful as one can take pics of the river area with the reflections in full splendor.,,,
,,Go for the sunset,4,,"If you like taking pictures of cities etc from heights - this is the place for you, The ride lasts for one hour - and you have to wait in line for around 20-30 mins to get a ticket. Each car has 6 or so people and you wouldnt really sit around as the views are good. Go towards sunset so you get pics before and after the lights come on.",,,
,,Beautiful views of Singapore,4,,A very slow ride however that provides more photo opportunities. Quite a few people in one carriage which can be an issue with viewing if everyone gathers around one corner. It is a bit pricey at $33 for adults but the amazing views of Singapore are definitely worth it on the second largest wheel in the world.,,,
,,Nice view of Singapore (evening),4,,"You have a choice between the Singapore flyer and Marina Bay Sands, I personally prefer the flyer for a view of Singapore and preference for evening when the city is lit up is lovely now with all the yearly additions (attractions) to the city",,,
,,Nice View,5,,"It was good experience, but nothing to excited about. Yes its a giant flyer, excellent view of the Singapore, but speed was so slow that you didn't even feel it.",,,
,,"Moves extremely slowly, but can deliver great views",3,,"I found it a bit slow for my liking. However, if you get on the flyer at the right time, you can have breathtaking views of Singapore. Sunset would be a great time to visit Singapore Flyer.",,,
,,Good view of SIngapore,4,,Reasonable entry fee and short queues compared to London Eye but a comfortable ride giving extensive views over the whole of the city and the harbour.,,,
,,My First Date,3,,"Go for it at night and enjoy the splendor that is the city coming to live at night.
There's nothing to do once inside but to sit and wait much as you would in a cable car.
You'll be with other people so well that does take away some of the other things that could have made it better, perhaps you'd want to make out like crazy with your date? Haha.

To sum it up, it's for the scenery.",,,
,,Nice Flyer,3,,"We have had a huge expectation before getting into flyer. Though it is a very good experience, I would suggest to ride on it in two ways, e.g. just before dusk to see Singapore in day light fading & lighting is on throughout. It is obviously a great thing to watch. Facility inside is good and management is also good.",,,
,,Super- must do,5,,Great views of the Marina bays sands Hotel and the gardens by the bay. Definitely a must do in Singapore.,,,
,,Awesome views. Take your camera!,5,,Had an awesome time. Great weather to be able to see everything. Not many people (weekday) so we had the gondola to ourselves. This made it easy to take pano pictures with our camera.,,,
,,Great view,4,,Took the MRT to Bayfront and then a 10 minute walk to the Flyer. Mid morning so only a 10 minute wait and great views. Well worth the visit and best way to get the layout of the city and coast. Spot of lunch at the Hawkers market below and then a short walk to Marina Bay shopping Mall.,,,
,,It was just okay,3,,"Maybe I had too much expectation as everybody raved about it, for the price you pay, it was so so, just a view you can get else where as well like in a cable car in Santosa",,,
,,Beautiful view of the city!,5,,The Singapore Flyer is a touristic attraction for tourists to overview the central business district. It is also possible to dine on the flyer but we haven't done that. Maybe during night time it would give a very unique dining experience!,,,
,,amazing,5,,good views of singapore and the F1 track. Bars are expensive there for a drink. There are water taxis just outside so its easy to get back to your hotel.Well worth a trip on this.,,,
,,Very good way to see much of Singapore,5,,This is a very relaxing way to see a large part of Singapore and to enjoy the 20 minute ride aboard the Flyer !,,,
,,Splendid view,5,,"Spectacular panaromic view from the top. A bit slow though, but definitely a must do in Singapore. Spacious cabins and nice fun overall",,,
,,View alone makes it worth it,5,,"We were there on a weekend night around Chinese New Year. Absolutely packed downtown, so much going on, parades and parties and street food. Getting up in the Singapore Flyer and seeing all the festivities sprawling through the city was totally worth the slightly high price of admission into the Flyer. What an awesome experience and a great way to look out over a large part of Singapore. Highly recommend this one, even if you're only in Singapore for a day or two.",,,
,,Nice view but the pace could be shorter,4,,Went twice with guests and it was actually quite nice for the first 15 mins as all will be busy looking at all angles... But after that the next 15-20 mins it became a little bored. Will suggest maybe there should be a recorded introduction of the surrounding as then people will look at each place more than 5 mins.,,,
,,Nice view,4,,Good view from top to Singapore city i went there by bus Its recommended to visit it there is some restaurant around the place,,,
,,Sunset View and Singapore View,4,,"I recommend this attraction at Sunset as you can see the CBD lighting up. It is quite nice. by clear weather you can see al the way till Indonesian islands of Riau.
Good to do it once to have a nice perspective of Singapore. there are a Q system therefore for sunset you will to time yourself to be sure you catch the right time. not the cheapest but good to do. They do also sometime option with Diner and private capsule for special occasion. Check their website. it is accessible by bus or via MRT from Esplanade and about 5-8 min walk depending on your speed. there also restaurants at the bottom serving the whole array of foods and some souvenir shops",,,
,,Nice experience,5,,Great views. A very gentle and slow rotation allows you to take in all the views. You can also book dinner on board one of the pods.,,,
,,Beautiful,5,,If you want a sky high view of Singapore this is where you'll get it! You don't even realize you are moving. The views are beautiful.,,,
,,Enjoyable way to view Singapore,4,,"Went up for a ride on Christmas Eve in the evening, was not crowded and we did not have to wait. Was nice to see the city lit up, twlight is a good time to go to get the best views. At 30 mins it was fine for small children too..",,,
,,Not to be Missed,5,,Its an icon and is strongly recommended to be visited. Gives an amazing view of Singapore City. Ideal would be to get a ride both during day and night time; day for pictures and night to see the beautiful Night View of Singapore. Is convenient by Taxi as MRT Station is at a distance. There Souvenir Shop is quite expansive just like all other such shops in Singapore. Singapore Flyer is a MUST visit place in Singapore and probably should be the first on the To Do List,,,
,,Good view...........,4,,Very thrilling and exciting to have a ride on this flyer. A must visit attraction in Singapore...............,,,
,,Amazing Views,4,,"Like everything in Singapore it's not cheap but it's well worth the money. Great views across Singapore's harbor, city, Gardens by the bay and the marina bay sands.",,,
,,Good!!,4,,"Good experience. Since I had been to London Eye already, I didn't find it too exciting though. The entry to board the flyer is done nicely, unlike London eye. Nice view of Singapore.",,,
,,a quiet place to be,4,,"it's not nearby other attractions, if you'd like to walk here from the esplanade, do expect 20-30 mins. Not much to see up in the sky in Singapore too, as you could imagine. A nice place to have a chat by the sea, with a drink, to relax and to release.",,,
,,A must do,5,,The Singapore flyer offers a complete tourist experience. There are shops and restaurants in the complex housing the Flyer. The Flyer offers fantastic views of Singapore. There is plenty of time allowed on the ride to appreciate the views.,,,
,,Amazinggggg,5,,The experience was mesmerizing. The capsule was very spacious & comfortable for +-30 minutes of rotation. I bought the ticket via online & hassle free!,,,
,,Good view at night!,5,,"very good place to enjoy view of singapore. we visited it when people were in a small numbers so we could truly enjoy it during the trip. i love singapore very much, hope to travel here again.",,,
,,Incredible Views,4,,Great time on this Ferris wheel. Just be careful that you don't get grouped with people that may annoy you. The operator put us in with a group of small children that were already over excited. We just refused to get in with them so had a great time when we got on the next pax compartment. Not so bad if you don't like heights as it is a seriously large wheel and compartment you ride in.,,,
,,Worth a visit,4,,Cost 拢10 each and just about value for money. Ggood views all round. Approx half hour trip. Easy to get to,,,
,,Nice view and not at all scary,4,,The ride is too smooth and will not fear you. The 360 view is absolutely beautiful. Should try to visit at night time.,,,
,,Amazing Experience,5,,Highly recommended to take a trip to the Flyer. Amazing way to get to get to experience the views of the city.,,,
,,awesome,5,,"its a wonderful place to visit , its better go in the evening as you can see the beauty of the city in the evening , but even if you go in the day time its a wonder even.",,,
,,Flyer,4,,We jumped on the Singapore Flyer at 6.45pm and watched the sunset! You get to see some excellent views and watch the city lights come on.,,,
,,Wonderfull experience - Recommended,5,,The flyer is a must have experience one visiting Singapore should look for. The ride is optimized (circa 40 minutes) allowing sightseeing of the city from different angles and an opportunity to capture great pictures/images of the surrounding places.,,,
,,Tallest in the world - Amazing views..,5,,You should definitely try the flyer as you can see the city from above. It's beautiful during day time but better at night with amazing colourful city views. We loved it!!!!!!,,,
,,Once is enough,3,,"I was so excited when my mom told us that she got tickets for us to try the infamous Singapore Flyer. Together with some of family friends we went.

I love the theme of the entrance- it was like checking in for a flight. There are many interesting bits and bobs you can find on the way to the main event which is the Flyer.

The experience is good, you'll be able to see the city in a higher level. However, I think because I'm so used on seeing Singapore, I wasn't really mesmerized by the ride anymore. It is still an experience though. And if you're a tourist, you'll probably enjoy it.",,,
,,Wonderful views,5,,We enjoyed the flyer ride. When we went there were no queues and the pods were not crowded and you could move around and see the view from different sides. An interesting overview of Singapore. The price was not bad although we were disappointed that concessions only applied to Singapore citizens!,,,
,,Romantic,5,,"Maybe i'm biased cuz this is where I had my first official date with my (now) husband, where we had dinner in one of the capsules. The place is romantic and beautiful at night and it's always fun to be on a ferris wheel. The meal itself was so-so as expected but you are there basically for the view and it did feel special dining on the flyer.",,,
,,Very good scenery!,5,,"We went there in the afternoon, so we can view the sunset from the top. It was moving very slow, so you can't feel that u're moving. We took lots of great pictures, especially at night, where all the property turn on their beautiful colorful lights. We came in a big giant capsule with other people. U can buy an early bird online tickets, its more cheaper than you buy it in the locket. When you reached the highest top of view, there will be announcement and you can see all of Singapore from your spot.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer on Christmas Eve,5,,It was a amazing experience to visit Singapore Flyer on Christmas Eve. The best time to visit it is on evening between 21.00 and 22.00. It was worth to pay $33.00 each for one adult. My whole family enjoyed the experience. It was so amazing view over Singapore at night.,,,
,,A definite have to in Singapore,5,,If visiting Singapore one should do a turn with Singapore flyer first thing to see the city and get a feel for the sorrundings,,,
,,A great way to get a lay of the land in Singapore,5,,"Taking a spin on The Singapore Flyer is a great way to get your bearings of the city. Unlike a Ferris Wheel, the pace of the Flyer is slow, and it gives you just enough time to see everything and to listen to the audio recording (each person gets their own map and audio guide so you can decide what you want to listen to). Thoroughly enjoyable!",,,
,,Nothing great. Do it if you are around the promenade at night.,3,,"You get a good view of the bayfront area. It's nothing great. The views from the promenade itself are quite good. The height, surprisingly, doesn't add much value in my opinion. Still doable if you are around the promenade area at night and have an hour to spare.",,,
,,Spectacular View,4,,"Very spectacular view of Marina Bay and a few of Singapore's finest district. Ride takes about 30 minutes. Sit back, relax and enjoy the breathtaking views.",,,
,,Awesome views of the city!!,5,,We went on school trip for band. It was awesome. Also took family to experience the ride and views. Really loved it. Lasts a long time and u really can see everything from top!! Highly recommend it!!,,,
,,Fantastic View,5,,"I went on Dec 15 with my family.. We ride at night, and found out a spectacular view of lights at night at Marina Bay area..",,,
,,Fabulous Flyer !!!,5,,"Huge and Humongous Flyer located in the heart of the city, though the cost is high, but it is worth spending, I with my wife and 2 children experienced this wonderful flyer and enjoyed a lot, took some glorious photos and videos to cherish for our entire life time.

Must visit for all age groups when we are in Singapore, we can spend more than 2 hours here, it has all the amenities for the visitors with ample car parking and washrooms at strategic locations.",,,
,,Fantastic view of the city,5,,Exhilarating experience to see the vast city grounds. The tickets are well worth it. Try to bring nice zoom lenses (red ring type) to take detailed pics.,,,
,,Amazing at night,5,,We walked around this area during the day but decided to try this at night. It was absolutely beautiful with all of the lights from the city.,,,
,,Bit pricey,3,,Wonderful view of the city but pricey for only 30 minutes. One rotation takes 30 minutes and cost was 33sgd,,,
,,Great views,4,,Still a classic family adventure. Very comfortable way of taking in the sights of Singapore. Good value but would be good if there was a family discount,,,
,,Wonderful Full View of Singapore,5,,"Nevertheless, A MUST VISIT in Singapore. You can choose to drive there or by public transport. You can get nice & affordable souvenirs from here as well.",,,
,,Great place,5,,Great way to see all the main sites of Singapore. 30 minutes to see all the sites we even saw the grand prix track and pits,,,
,,Unforgettable views,4,,"The admission price might seem a bit steep for such a short ride (approximately 30 minutes), but the views of Singapore are simply incredible on top of the Singapore Flyer. Go at night for an even more amazing view.",,,
,,Great experience,4,,We had some free time and decided to ride the flyer. Tickets were easy to buy and we had no waiting at all. Thankfully we went on a reasonably clear day and had great views of the city. The cabins were air-conditioned and lots to see. Gardens by the Bay looked great from above. One rotation lasts around 30 minutes. They take your photo on the way in and you have the option to purchase on exit through the souvenir shop.,,,
,,Great view,4,,"Great view of Singapore, would highly recommend getting there early to beat the crowds! Raffles is close so go get a Singapore sling afterwards!! X",,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,Traveling to Singapore for work allows for some play time. On my first trip I knew I had to go on the Flyer. The giant Ferris Wheel is not what I first expected. You are inside a glass tube (with air conditioning) that moves rather slow to allow plenty of photos and discoveries.,,,
,,Singapore view from the high,4,,"Try this adventure. We can see almost of Singapore land from the highest place. Its safe and its fun, even for one of you which dont like the high
And this country amaze me with the cleaness they had. People are so ease to understand...tourist are love so much visited this country",,,
,,Was just about to buy tickets when the flyer was suspended due to weather warning which didn't materialise,4,,Was really looking forward to this experience but was shut due to weather warning which didn't materialise. We did go to the food street downstairs and had some amazing food.,,,
,,Nice to say you've done it but you get better views from top of Marina Bay Hotel,3,,"Visited late at night so only had a short queue. Even though it wasn't busy, they stuffed the cabin completely full. Views were nice but partly blocked by the flyer itself and I found it frustrating having to wait for a space at the window to get a nice photo of the view because the cabin was so full of people. I've visited Singapore a few times and find that you'll get better, less obstructed views from some of the hotel bars in the city and can spend the money you'd pay to get on the flyer on a drink instead!",,,
,,Birthday treat,5,,"I booked a champagne flight for my husbands 50th birthday as a treat. We arrived a little late and I felt sure they were going to tell us at the check in desk that we had missed our opportunity - not so!
We were whisked upstairs and had to wait a few minutes for the next champagne flight car to come around before we could hop on.
We had the car to ourselves!! Amazing. Am sure these are hugely expensive to hire the whole thing to yourselves.
We were thrilled to bits. We slurped our champagne, danced around a bit, ate the chocolates and had uninterupted views of Singapore by night.
It was magical and I would highly recommend this.",,,
,,Not For People with...,3,,"Ride once and never dare to try again. Throughout the ride, I stayed and sat in the middle, dare not look out.. guess the height scare me.. however my kids enjoyed the ride! Good for people who enjoy the height!",,,
,,Take the river cruise instead,3,,"If you want to see a great view of the city, I suggest you to take the 45 min river cruise instead of 30 minutes of mundane ride on the flyer. The cabin is big, which can fit over 10 people. So, expect to see people and children walking/running around. The ride is slow. After ten minutes or so, my family started to feel bored. However, it is a potential photo taking opportunity if you are nearby.",,,
,,Amazing views of Singapore,5,,"We were with friends and I was persuaded to join them in the Singapore Flyer despite not liking heights. However, the views are worth any height phobia and to be honest, it didn't feel like we were so high up. Well worth it!",,,
,,Singapore Visit,5,,This is a must. An hour well spent. You can pre-arrange to have dinner while on the flyer. The view is great and you can see for miles,,,
,,Good view,4,,This place gives good view of the city and is certainly is worth a visit. You can buy tickets for this attraction as a combo with other city attractions.,,,
,,Amazing views...be persuasive!!,5,,"My girlfriend and I went on here after a bit of an argument. She is scared of heights so she definitely did not want to do this. After some persuasion, I managed to get her to come on with me. After around 2 minutes she created a bit of a scene and laid on the floor of the cabin but eventually realised it was not too bad and was completely safe. We saw views we would never have if we didn't go on it and she thanked me afterwards. We got some great pictures with the marina bay etc behind us. I would recommend anyone to go through the arguments and persuade them to go on it as it is so worth it.",,,
,,Good view of the city,3,,"A number of large capsules on a giant wheel, each capsule fits about 10 ppl at a time if you take the normal one but I understand that the expensive ones have drinks and dinner served as well... Good views of the city .... Can be taken both at night or during the day...",,,
,,See Singapore from a different view,4,,"My family and I truly enjoyed the flyer. The rotation is perfectly timed to provide you 30-45 Minutes of breath taking views of the country we like to call our 2nd home. The queue is the only thing you need to wait on....and I'd suggest a early morning or evening visit to take advantage of some beautiful sunsets and the like.

Btw.. Definitely try the Bayview tandor restaurant at the flyer....very good Indian food.",,,
,,A long 30 minutes,4,,"We visited singapore many times before but never had the chance to ride the flyer until now.

So, it's actually an observational deck where you can see almost all parts of the city. The kids love it.

The capsules are all air conditioned and equipped with chairs. And like all other singapore tourism spot it is also well maintained and clean.

The ride itself is moving really slow.. It took something like 30 minutes or more to complete. And at some point you'll feel bored.",,,
,,Romantic wheel at night,5,,"Im here through helix bridge, easy to find, and 1 capsules is for max 25 peoples.its take around 30 minutes for 1 circle, from inside you can see the beautifull singapore, buildings, marina bay sand hotel, the lamps were so great i like the night scenery from flyer.",,,
,,Good Experience of Flyer,5,,Though this was my second flyer experience in Singapore the Flyer is must go for Arial view of city as this is bang on the Marian bay and you have a nice experience people afraid of heights be care full. but must do ride.,,,
,,Evening Views are Great,4,,It seems a bit pricey but we found it worth it. The complete rotation takes 30 minutes and it is very gentle. We went in the evening and there were no crowds our group of 4 had our own capsule. The view of the lights makes for some great photos.,,,
,,Amazing views!!,4,,"We hopped on the Flyer around 7.30pm. We purchased online tickets and entrance was pretty simple. A quick bag scan and off we went.
The actual capsule moved slowly so it's not too terrifying for people with fear of heights. The ride took about 30 minutes. We were able to move around the capsule through out the whole ride. The whole experience was great, the views at night are amazing. We were able to watch the light show from above and could see the whole city on a cloudy day.
The only downside is that the closest MRT is Promenade, a 10 - 15 minutes walk from there to the Flyer.",,,
,,A must do.,5,,Loved this place. Amazing views of the city and enjoyed looking out at where we had been on our trip. Definitely need to be able to handle highs to do this. We went in the day and it was clear so would avoid in cloudy wet weather. Cost was $33 per adult but worth it took 30-45 minutes.,,,
,,Good Views,4,,The Singapore flyer offers stunning views of pretty much all the nearby attractions as well the city. It moves pretty slow and covers the entire round in about 30-40 mins.,,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"If you have been on a flyer or big wheel in London, Osaka or any other big city this will be pretty much the same except for the views of course... The big wheel gives you great views of Singapore including a nice view of marina bay sands and the F1 track. Great for couples or for families since you can fit big groups into one carriage. Shop around online for discounts since there are always good deals to be had.",,,
,,Awesome view,5,,This is a great ride especially during sunset. The ride is about 30 minutes and is worth the money. The rude is super smooth and subtle so don't be afraid.,,,
,,The skylines of Singapore,3,,A must to experience on the ferris wheel. Watch the skylines and spot the merlion as you go up.... Camera on the go ofcourse,,,
,,Breathtaking view,5,,"The flyer offers breathtaking views to the city. I recommend that you leave this to the end of your trip, so you can enjoy it more and see every building from a different perspective other than going there before being able to recognize it.
The flyer is surrounded by a small shopping center and a garden.
The staff is friendly and very helpful. Before the actual trip on the flyer there's a mini museum with all sorts of pictures and holograms of the city and the flyer.",,,
,,Good to have experience,3,,If visiting Singapore then better go to Singapore Flyer for best views instead of Marina Bay Sands Observation Deck. The wheel moves very slowly that we don't feel the movement.Its fine for all ages. Try searching for Discount coupons online to save some money.,,,
,,beautiful,5,,go up and see all singapore .but the price is quiet high 33sgd per person.have to go at night and so romantic,,,
,,Nice view from top,4,,"One time go. Gives full city view from the top and can see the singapore port, city , marina bay, gardens by the bay and many more.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Went on the flyer and was a good experience. Clear day so was able to see all around. Went at 1230pm and got a capsule for just the 4 of us so that made it special.

Food court under the flyer was not so great. Ok but very traditional although the price was good.",,,
,,A breathtaking view of the Marina Bay,4,,"We had walked to the Singapore Flyer from the Merlion Park and saw how beautiful its surroundings were, but a sky high view was just as enjoyable if not more. I could catch the Sands, the Merlion, Gardens by the Bay, Esplanade Theater and more all in one place. We didn't notice the time pass. Made me wonder how attractive a night view would be.",,,
,,Unbelievable!,5,,Whole experience was great. Decent price comsidering you are on the flyer for roughly 30 mins. Views and cabins were awesome would recommend all visitors to experiemce the Flyer.,,,
,,i love this,5,,flying in the sky. Touch the sky. Panoramic view of Singapore. On the full height when stopped for a while I feel very exited.,,,
,,Great views,4,,The Flyer is a pleasant way to get a panoramic view of Singapore in all directions. It takes about 30 minutes to do the full revolution. On a clear day the views across Singapore are fantastic so take your camera. All in all a good way to pass some time in Singapore. I think this would be a fun activity for young families.,,,
,,Great place....busy at Christmas.,4,,We went over the Christmas period and have been a number of times before. The gardens are easy to walk to or catch a cab to. They are clean and an interesting tourist attraction. The Christmas Wonderland was a great end of year touch but was so busy. I would recommend this place for anyone to visit.,,,
,,Beautiful city views!,4,,"Very easy experience, no long queues or waiting around. Very clean and the views of the city are breathtaking, it almost does not look real. Definitely worth doing if you're in Singapore.",,,
,,Romantic recycable,4,,"Once is enough unless u really really love to be in the cabin for 30 min, walking in a restircted space hahaha !",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"This is a great site to visit in Singapore. The city and Marina Bay views are really great, although now that Marina Bay Sands is open to the public the panoramic views from their viewing platform rival those of the Flyer.Still a good visiting place.",,,
,,A must on the Singapore attraction circuit,5,,"It is a gentle ""flight"" and it offers magnificent views of Singapore and beyond. We went late afternoon on 25 December and there were not long lines. One should check while you are in the line waiting to ""board"" and if the people directly in front or behind you in the line seems to be a bit loud and noisy, give way and wait for the next capsule. A good experience.",,,
,,"Decent view of Singapore skyline, but not value-for-money",2,,"The Good:
* The Singapore Flyer offers a good view of the Singapore skyline

The Bad:
* The view gets a little stagnant after a while; awkward atmosphere at times with the other guests in the same ""cubicle"" similar to the ""passengers in the lift""
* Better value from visiting Gardens By The Bay and soaking in the skyline of Singapore from rooftop bars / restaurants in the various skyscrapers of Singapore whilst sipping wine or a cocktail",,,
,,Majestic attraction,5,,"The singapore flyer is so big that impress me a lot. We take a ride on it, an it takes about 15 mins to reach the top of the flyer. The view was incredibly spectacular.
Everything seems to be small beneath my foot. This is a good way to explore the other side of Singapore! I really enjoy it!",,,
,,Must do..,5,,A nice 30 minute ride that gives a very good glimpse. Try a weekday to avoid crowds. It could give you a different perspective to the city at night.,,,
,,stunning views,5,,A must do when in Singapore - the views are simply stunning - of not just Marina Bay but further afield - simply lovely and made better by having a Singapore Sling whilst having your flight.,,,
,,Nice views,5,,The Singapore flyer is a god attraction with great views over the city. We did it straight after the top floor of the marina sands and I would advise to do only one of the two as they offer similar views. Being in a Ferris wheel does add something for the kids,,,
,,View from the top ...,4,,"When you visit Singapore don't forget to try Singapore Flyer, you can have view of ""entire"" Singapore.",,,
,,Amazing Experience,5,,"As someone who is not great with heights, I was rather reluctant to go on the Singapore Flyer but I am extremly glad that I did.

The cost was $33.00 per ticket for us which we considered value for money given it took approximately 30 minutes to go all the way around and the views were spectacular the whole time.

For those not great with heights, the ""capsules"" that you are in are large (mostly empty except for some benches in the middle to sit on if you don't want to stand), fully enclosed, and extremely sturdy so you feel safe and secure. My partner and I also got one to ourself which was an added bonus.",,,
,,Scared of heights but great view,4,,"Went on this with Hubby and daughter, she loved it, not a fan of heights but felt very safe, go at night so you can see the night light up its beautiful, grab yourself a pic at the end as a reminder ,",,,
,,Best view at night,3,,"I went with my colleagues during a company event. It was on the day when we get a ride. It was a good experience, it moves so slow you wont even feel it. It takes around 30 or 45mins b4 you reach the ground. Just nice to have time to see the vast view. It still has day light so we saw all the unpleasant construction sites, empty spaces and dull scenery. I suggest you take a ride at night. With all the shimmering lights from the buildings, bridges, vehicles and boats. It's worth your money.",,,
,,"Nice view a ""tour""",5,,The flyer is a nice way to see Singapore and to learn some of the history. Great for visitors and also enjoyable for residents.,,,
,,Amazing views,4,,"Tickets are reasonably priced, and family pricing is available. We arrived at around 3pm, just before the rains began. Initially, you walk through a air conditioned area, where you can learn all about the construction and history of the flyer. After a very short wait, we boarded the flyer with only about 8 people in the pod, making it plenty of space to walk around or sit if you prefer. All the pods are air conditioned to a comfortable amount, so chances of you sweating are slim. An essential visit in Singapore for all!",,,
,,Excellent views from the top,4,,Very good for a nice relaxing time to admire the city views especially after sunset. It takes around 40 mins and is a very pleasant experience.,,,
,,Great views!,5,,What a great way to see the City! It also was off-season so no lines and we had the car to ourselves!,,,
,,Singapore Flyer - Excellent place to visit,5,,"If you're travelling to Singapore,
This should be on your must visit places.

Singapore Flyer -
- Awesome 360 degree View
- Must visit if you're in Singapore for a short visit
- Plenty of eating options at Level 1

You can Sit, stand , Move around while you're in it .
take loads of pics with friends, family.",,,
,,A great experience! Not for Night Photography,4,,"Singapore Flyer.. as the name suggests, kinda flies you over Singapore! You can see the entire city and they claim you can also see Indonesia. However, its a great 30 min experience to see the city specially at night.

I'm a hobby photographer and a pretty good one at that. I took some shots and they were good despite the thick glass. However, a better option is the skypark on the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel.",,,
,,Beautiful view,4,,"I went up there just in time for the city to be illuminated by the street lights. It was beautiful to see the sky slowly become darker, and the city lit up with its own artificial light. I even timed it correctly with the daily light and sound show by the super trees, in Gardens by the Bay. Meaning I could see the flashing lights in the park from a bird's-eye view in the flyer. Pretty amazing.",,,
,,"Excellent Views, worth the money",5,,"we went on a Sunday morning from staying at the pan pacific hotel. it is walking distance even in the hot humid sun.

its a bit confusing that the ticket office is no where near the actual flyer, but sign-age is in English and the people around are very happy to direct.

""flight"" lasts around 30-45 mins, views are spectacular.

we went around 11am and had a pod to ourselves (4 of us) couldn't ask for better.

Credit cards were accpeted",,,
,,Another big wheel with a view,4,,Great views like you get from big wheels in any city. Clearly you need good weather but the views are spectacular given what is around. A bit difficult to find the pay booth when you go there off peak. It is not well signposted.,,,
,,Aerial ride with a view!,4,,Riding on the Singapore Flyer is a must for first timers to the island city as it offers a wonderful 360 degree view of the city from high up. it a different experience to see it post dusk for a fascinating night view of the city. Its about 45 minute for a full turn which moves slowly so you can savour the views.,,,
,,Noramal Ferris wheeel,3,,"Its just another Ferris Wheel but the Singapore Bay Area, Marina Bay Sands, F1 circuit and the skyscrapers in the background are a treat to the eye.",,,
,,See Singapore Skyline from different angle,5,,"Truly impressed by the night view of Singapore, what i did is I went to Marina Bay Sky Garden during day time and visit Singapore Flyer at night,",,,
,,Panoramic view of Singapore skyline,4,,"The flyer has some great city views. The children are generally quite entertained observing Singapore. However, considering it takes mare than half an hour to complete a round, they can get restless towards the end. However, it is a worthwhile experience with great views of the Singapore skyline.",,,
,,On the hazy period,2,,"Strongly recommend that you should take it during night if you are supposed to make a visit to the Singapore Flyer.
The entire ride will took around 30mins. The night scene is definitely one of the positives for it. It can be quite boring throughout the entire ride if you are supposed to take it alone as there is nothing else to do other than phototaking at the highest point.",,,
,,Nice view at night !!,4,,"Was very lighted up at night . They charge $5 extra after sunset but worth a visit. You see all the Singapore from the top. A must visit if you didn't visit the London eye. if you go to the sunset ride, reach there an hour before as it is crowds during sunset and weekends.",,,
,,Spectacular views - worth the visit,5,,"Even though we were staying at Marina Bay Sands we still wanted to visit the Flyer to compare it against the London Eye. First of all it is much larger that the London Eye, second access is higher up with a beautiful mock rain forest underneath it and third the Flyer was completely empty on a Wednesday afternoon so giving us a cabin just for ourselves.

As with any of the attractions there is a cost to visiting the Flyer of around SGD33 per adult. However our party of 4 included one in a wheelchair we only paid for 3 as one was considered the carer.

The Flyer is located around some restaurants and an area with mock street food stalls. When we visited in the afternoon around 3pm the stalls were not busy but I think that many visit in the evenings when the lights of Singapore are dazzling.

If you are visiting Singapore and have a spare few hours this is well worth a visit followed by a walk along the bay to the Merlion and we f you have further energy to spare to the Quays.",,,
,,Great Top View,4,,Great Top View .. You can identify all Singapore attractions from over there and the height experience is great. Simply a MUST in case you didn't go to the 60 floor in Marina Bay sands.,,,
,,Not really worth the money.,2,,I don't suffer from claustrophobia but I did on this attraction in Singapore!! Our children enjoyed it but became quickly bored. The same view is available at many other places around Singapore. The queues are long during peak times. I wouldn't recommend this.,,,
,,Good View,4,,"I love the view, good speed, highly recommended, Best is to go after lunch, the guide is friendly. Bought several gifts at the shop.",,,
,,Fantastic experience,4,,"Well worth the visit to this attraction, we had a 'pod' all to ourselves, two people, as did everyone else that were there at the same time, the round trip or one full revolution of the flyer takes about 30 minutes which is perfect to see all that can be seen from the wheel, the music in the pod was not very inspiring but as it was at a low level it didn't seem that bad, I think it cost about SD$32 per person which was not too bad.There are VIP pods which can be booked with champagne and more comfortable looking seats if that is your bag but I'm not sure of the cost.",,,
,,After dark views,4,,"All has been said already. Price is high but the views are great. The queue was very short and it was a nice, no thrill ride.",,,
,,Awesome view of the city from the top,5,,We were on honeymoon trip to Singapore and decided to go for Singapore flyer and the experience was awesome. The birds eye view of the city was a very good experience,,,
,,Do not miss!,5,,"Fantastic. View is spectacular in all directions. Tip:if flying Singapore Airlines, hold on to your boarding pass as you can get a discount.",,,
,,Better than the London eye,4,,"If you would like to take a breathe of Singapore's beautiful building, you certainly have to take the flyer.

It takes abt an hour completing the cycle so I think u shall get an amazing view if u can take a cabin just before sunset to see Singapore before and after sunset. It's breathe taking.",,,
,,"""Must do"" attraction",4,,"The Singapore Flyer gives you the best views of the city and beyond. It moves really slowly which gives you plenty of
time to take in the views and move around the ""car"" for photos. We went in the day but if would be pretty special at night . Highly recommended.",,,
,,Flyer Or Zipper ?,4,,"Been up and round there many times in the past when it was newly commissioned and a novelty. But seemed to have weared off as many new options such as those at OUB's Altitude Bar ( @ Raffles Place ) and Sky @ Marina Bay Sands are available.

Best views of the city scape are at night. Perhaps an audio commenatry and guide could be included as part of the ticketing package.",,,
,,Singapore version of London eye,4,,"If you have done the London eye, you can skip this. But if you want to give yourself and kids an experience, try it once. 30 minutes around it in total.",,,
,,London Eye's little brother,5,,A great viewpoint to see Singapore with minimal time! Awesome spot to kill time if you're only in Singapore for a day/transit.,,,
,,A Great Night Out,5,,"We took our children to experience this on our last night in Singapore. This is an experience but it comes at a price. For the 4 of us total came to $99S so it's pricey. Other options are available including dining cars, and many other packages. The night we were there, there was not too many people waiting so we were able to have the entire car for our family. The view is amazing at night since we can see the entire city lights from any part of the Flyer. The car was clean and the entire facility was well maintained. The Flyer moves slow enough so you do get to enjoy your visit and not feel rushed at all. This is a must for any visitors with or without children.",,,
,,what a view,5,,the slow and the serene movement of the Singapore flyer is a sight to behold. the views from inside are equally breath taking.,,,
,,Top of the world,5,,An experience of a life time especially the aerial view and view of the Marina Bay Hotel. The rotation of the cars are rather silent no unnecessary noices and no rocking of the movement cars even at the highest point. Brilliant view through the glass windows and the approach to the place is very well organised and structured,,,
,,Spectacular view,5,,Experience a spectacular view from the capsule. Go at night where you will get to enjoy Singapore's skyline. Beautiful lights and fantastic view of the Christmas Wonderland of the Marina Bay Sands.,,,
,,quite boring,3,,for the high price it's quite boring. the view is nice but with marina bay sands next to it where you have a much better view it's not worth the money. just walk around marina bay instead. it's for free and just as nice.,,,
,,Great view!,5,,A must do in Singapore! Spectacular view & amazing experience! Highly recommend! Even though I am quite afraid of heights it was an awesome experience.,,,
,,Superviews!,5,,"My wife and I walked across the Helix bridge to the Singapore Flyer from the Marina Bay Mall, it took about 45minutes to walk as we were taking so many pictures along the way. It was very hot and humid, if it had rained there was no area to shelter once on the bridge.
As we arrived at the base of the Singapore Flyer we were hot and bothered and there is a small shop that sells cold drinks and ice creams with a small seating area.
After a short rest and ice cream we entered the Mall area below the Flyer. We followed the signs to the entrance and were told to go to the ticket office before entering the Flyer. It could have been signed better.
We handed over our tickets and entered the route to the Flyer, they take your picture and you have the option to buy the pictures after the Flyer trip.
We were very lucky we had a whole POD to ourselves!!
WOW! We thought the views from the Super Tree were amazing, now double it as the views were superb and a lot higher. Super views in every direction , over the river , the Marina Bay Hotel, the Marina Gardens and so far all the way across the Singapore Straits to Indonesia!!
The ride is slow but it is a great opportunity to take some super pictures over Singapore.
After our trip we passed through the small gift shop.
Underneath the Flyer is a food court and we had a snack at the Chinese food stand it was very fast food and was hot and tasty, sitting outside made it special.
Nearby is the ""Duck"" river tours and it is also a bus park for the Singapore open top bus tours.",,,
,,Fantastic View including Grand Prix Circuit,5,,"We took the ride in Singapore Flyer and completely enjoyed it.

We entered the Flyer around 6.30 p.m. when there was sunlight and by the time our cabin was at the top of the Flyer the sun had set and Singapore was lighted up. Beautiful.

The Singapore river, Marina Bay, the Grand Prix circuit, Empress Place was covered in the Panoramic view. It was breathtaking.",,,
,,View from top,4,,We went around 5 in the evening. There was no queue at all.There is no need to buy the tickets in advance. It was a pleasant 20 mins ride.,,,
,,Awesome experience,4,,Such a great way to spend a nite! We had new experience in enjoying the singapore night view from the above. Nice!,,,
,,Stunning view of Singapore,5,,"I think I worth spending, we went to the flyer on the evening and we can view stunning view of Singapore, good place to purpose your girlfriend.",,,
,,Good views,4,,If you visiting Singapore it's definitely worth doing. Gives you a whole view of the city. Beautiful skyline building and lights.,,,
,,Seemed expensive but worth it!,4,,"When we first decided to take the flyer, based on recommendations by friends and other travellers I was a bit horrified by the price - it seemed really expensive for what you got. I'm so glad we went!

We went in early evening just after dark following our visit to Gardens by the Bay and the famous light show. We were in a small group - only two other couples in our carriage. The time to do a lap was good. enough to see and chat about all the sights and get some good photographs.

Take a tripod if you want to get good night photographs.",,,
,,Best to see in the day,5,,Amazing views. Good value for money. Takes approx 45 mins to go all the way round. We saw this in the day and did the Marina Bay Sands at night. so we had a great view of both day and night,,,
,,Relaxing views,5,,"A nice slow revolution allowing you to see all over Singapore.

Have heard on clear days you can see Malaysia and Indonesia. Sadly there have been no clear days during our visit.

The pods are nicely air conditioned so the flight is a cooling pleasant trip.",,,
,,Worth it for the views!,5,,"I enjoyed my ""flight"" on the Singapore Flyer. It gave a unique view of the city and it showed just how much the city has changed over the years. It was also neat to see parts of the Formula 1. We went off season so had a very quiet pod which made it a romantic journey as well. It is kind of pricey but is worth doing at least once.",,,
,,whole largest perhaps,2,,Under rated attraction. Oversee views but nothing historic unlike London Eye. Price is reasonable to upkeep the venue. But nothing amazing. But I must say that the eateries are good. More outdoor activities encouraged.,,,
,,30 min!,3,,"Nice view for when you are facing the CBD area, but after that if you are somebody who is impatient, and dont wanna spend your time doing nothing, then you will spend the longest 20 min of your life inside that glass cabin.",,,
,,Nice view but it's so slow,3,,"One can get great view from up there but it take ages to turn or change the scenery. Slightly boring, there is an eatery area where one can taste local food.",,,
,,typical tourist spot,3,,"one of those typical tourist spots - does have a nice view if you like the city skylines? i think the best time is the evening just as the sunsets so you get the best of both worlds - enough light to see and also can see the skyline when all the lights come up. the one fullerton view is beautiful from the top.

but the old school food court there is overpriced for the food served though. still a more affordable option than the other restaurants there i suppose!",,,
,,wonderful for all age groups,5,,irrespective of baby or old . flyer is the only adventure every body can enjoy with all ease and comfort,,,
,,Brilliant view,4,,"This is definitely something to do while in Singapore, the view is great, especially at night. The bright colours on the flyer were exciting, though I imagine some people could find that irritating. It can be slow at times, but overall this was a great experience.",,,
,,"Relaxing, maybe",3,,"Went there just before sunset & suprisingly it was not that busy. Nothing much to say about being inside the flyer for 30minutes, you just enjoy the scenery & treasure it. The fact the we are travelling with infant & kids, we were stop from bringing dry foods for them onboard. So you would expect 30minutes ride they will go cranky. But we were suprise to see the other carrier has a group of family with small kids & infant bringing in some food. Not sure how they manage to bring the food but its obvious the staff did not do a good job or just being biased.",,,
,,The view is awesome,5,,Loved the experience. Views are amazing. Be sure to check out the small park underneath the Flyer. Great day there,,,
,,Not the Best View!,3,,"I personally feel that for a good view of the city, you would be better off at Marina Bay Sands/One Altitude or Equinox. The flyer is alright if you're doing it in the day time and given that there is tonnes of construction going on in Singapore all the time, it isn't the most scenic (its also tough to get good photos through the capsule). However, if you have limited time and you want to capture everything - definitely this is a good place. Do try to pair this with the other attractions in the area so that it's more worth the experience (i.e walking to Esplanade/F1 Pit Building/MBS)

PS - The food court has some of the most amazing food (curated so you know you're getting the best of many things). While it's pricier than the usual, its worth the taste!",,,
,,Best Views Of Singapore!,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is most definitely a must do attraction in Singapore. You get some amazing views of Singapore, especially Marina Bay.",,,
,,Go high and low in half an hour :),3,,It is a fantastic way to see Singapore's skyline and admire the beauty presented as we go up & down.,,,
,,VIEW WHOLE SINGAPORE IN HAWK's EYE,5,,One of the major attracton in Singapore... Really an awesome experience. But do prefer to visit during night as we can see the whole of Singapore lighted up and it is a very nice experience,,,
,,Great views across Singapore,5,,"Well organised attraction that offers amazing views across Singapore. Close to Marina Bay so you get to see the hotel, bay, gardens etc. Lasts around 30 minutes and turns really slowly. Seating is available in each pod as well.",,,
,,Fab views,5,,Really enjoyed this attraction very reasonably priced too and wonderful views of the surrounding area,,,
,,Excellent,5,,Visited this place second time after 6 years. Still the same standards maintained. Excellent and must visit in Singapore,,,
,,Largest Observation Wheel In The World! 锟斤拷锟斤拷,4,,"Tourist trap or not, the Singapore Flyer is a great way to catch some nice views of Singapore! I got here in the morning and it was not crowded! Before getting to the wheel, you can spend a few minutes in the museum like room to check out some videos and attractions they have on display!

Line was short and I was able to score my own capsule, YESSS!!! The capsules are air conditioned so they are comfortable and very easy to move around! Each angle was a postcard worthy portrait waiting to happen! You can spot many of Singapore's iconic attractions as well!

Just a fun fact, the Singapore Flyer is the biggest observation wheel in the world (Yes it's supposedly bigger than the London Eye.) The whole ride takes about thirty minutes and I thought it was worth the time, specially if you're in the city for just a few days!

Overall great views during the day, I wish I had the chance to see the city light up at night from above! Book your ticket online so you can go any time of the day instead of having to wait for a specific hour when you purchase the ticket on site!",,,
,,Wonderful views,5,,The views were wonderful and there was plenty of time to enjoy them. Queuing was well organised and we didn't have to wait long for our trip.,,,
,,30 min above Singapore for US$23,5,,"Very nice view. When we went we got lucky that it was no more than 5 minutes wait. But it looks like the building could hide a very long waiting queue, so would be safe to inquire of waiting time before buying ticket.",,,
,,Great way to see the whole city,4,,"This is a must do in Singapore, well worthwhile, very well run but oh how I hate the obligitory photo, which I never pay for. The Singapore food trail in the same complex is very good, highly recommended.",,,
,,Superior Scenario on top!,5,,"I didn't expect much on taken the flyer, but finally I must say that it is worth every cent. You should go there if you love to see nice view from the sky, it take only 2x minutes per round, pretty fast for me.",,,
,,LOVE Singapore Flyer,5,,"I'm a huge fan of ferris wheel, Singapore Flyer is one of most amazing one I've experienced. Not only the fabulous and breathtaking view, but also the elegant design. I do feel like flying when I reach the top, beautiful sunset spread over the whole city. I still remember that my friend and I sitting there enjoy the every single last minute we could hold. It just feels like yesterday every time I recall.",,,
,,Day and Night view of the city,4,,"Enjoy your ride on the Singapore Flyer and have a view day or night view of the city surroundings. Easy access by MRT, Taxi, car, bus and water Taxi. Many other interesting places around the Singapore Flyer so you can particularly send the whole day around this area of interest. There are Suntec shopping centre, MBS, Garden by the bay, Marina Barrage, Marina bay and Raffles city.",,,
,,Fantastic!,5,,What amazing views of Singapore from the Flyer! It takes about half an hour to do the trip in a 'car' that can hold up to 28 people - we were lucky enough to have 5! There is seating in the middle but you are free to walk around in order to get photos or just enjoy the view. I highly recommend this for all ages.,,,
,,100ft ride,3,,If u think it's adventures no not true..but still nice place u can see whole city from there..nice place to visit..not necessary u go to flyer,,,
,,Go at night,5,,Well worth a visit. We went up at night time and the views over Singapore were amazing! We booked in advance to beat the queues as it was quite busy.,,,
,,Amazing!,5,,"This was the highlight of our trip to Singapore, we went at night time and the view of the city at night was amazing. Don't let the height of it put you off as you feel totally secure even at the very top, loved it!",,,
,,Amazing views.,5,,The views are always changing in Singapore. From here you can see a ;lot of the development going on in Singapore. The lights are spectaculer at this time of the year. They go all out for Christmas with spectacular displays and lights.,,,
,,FUN RIDE,5,,"Buy tickets on line, so no waiting. Will not run if rain or lightening. Large roomy cabins. Moves very slow, a very smooth ride. Great panorama if you have a clear day.",,,
,,Must visit for every tourist,5,,"I found it to be very exciting and a must for every tourist visiting Singapore. It gives an excellent view of almost whole of Singapore skyline, Gardens by the bay, Marina and river.
We visited flyer in the morning hours and were very lucky to find absolutely no que as we straight away walked into the flyer. Also, we enjoyed every single minute of being inside the capsule as we were just six people in the entire capsule.
I strongly recommend Singapore flyer and absolute must visit for every tourist and suggest to visit in a day light as it gives you an amazing views.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Personally into city lights, and so when i went on in the evening the whole CBD was lit up. pretty amazing. Would be good if there was a commentary provided explaining certain attractions and such.",,,
,,Beautiful View,5,,Well managed. We did not wait long to get on and it went slowly which gave us time to take photos and take in the views. Recommend to visit while in Singapore,,,
,,Better to visit at night,5,,"As Singapore is a big city, everything is best viewed at night. Went for an early morning run and passed by this huge icon. It's alright but I guess it's best viewed when it's illuminated.

PS: You could run from the MRT Station to the Singapore Flyer. You'd see the Super Trees right across and the Marina Bay Sands just a few minutes worth of run from there and last stop would be the Merlion Statue. Lots of runners in the morning too.",,,
,,The coolest thing in Singapore,5,,"A brilliant fun thing to do in Singapore. The obvious viewing fun, coolness index and the thrill of getting on and off while its still moving",,,
,,Great View!,4,,"This is a must do when visiting Singapore as we have free admission from the SIA stopover deal so saved us SGD$66!!

The Flyer offers great views of the Marina Bay and Gardens by the Bay but next time we will go at night time.

Make sure you try the food at Singapore Food Trail on Ground level, also have SGD$10 food vouchers to spend there from the stopover deal. Thank you very much!!",,,
,,Great view!,4,,"I went there with my best friend, and the staff are very lovely. Last time they will take a picture and hand it to us as a souvenir. I am not quite sure about now. But it is a definitely great experience that you should try once in a life time.
Stunning view up at the top.",,,
,,Magnificent View of the Harbour & City,5,,Large pods carry you high above the Singapore harbour area on a 20 minute ride rising effortlessly on one of the biggest 'big wheels' in Asia. Good value and highly recommended.,,,
,,Sky View,4,,"It is about an hour ride, for me I prefer taking at 6pm cause you will experience 2 different Singapore's sky light. It is close to Marina area, so you can plan your timing",,,
,,Beautiful View and great Experience,5,,It's good experience to see the outside view through a flyer. It's my first flyer. The history is shown inside. Best time to view you can get I think 5.30pm to 7.00pm,,,
,,Stunning views,5,,I would certainly recommend this attraction. It gives you fantastic views of Singapore and out to sea. I was amazed to see how busy the port of Singapore is. The pods are so comfortable and air conditioned. The ride is so smooth you hardly feel that you are moving. The trip takes about 50 minutes and is well worth it.,,,
,,Excellent Views,4,,"We went in the morning and it was pretty quiet and we didn't have to wait that long. Great views over Singapore and especially the Marina Bay Sands and the F1 circuit below.
We actually went down and stood on the F1 track afterwards which you can walk on to which was an experience in itself too.",,,
,,The Panoramic View,3,,A typical touristy place to admire the view of Singapore from the top. I must say after whole day of walking around in the humid climate it was the perfect place to rest and cool down a bit while in the cabin. My only criticism would be lack of communication from the ticket office about VIP's. Having purchased tickets we head off to join the queue which was about approx 10 to 15min waiting for the cabins when 20 VIP's arrived. This has prolonged waiting time even more with no staff to explain or answer any questions. Once you are in the queue that is it. Not impressed. Solution would be letting people know about VIP's possibly arriving and skipping queue.,,,
,,second highest point to see singapore,3,,"beautiful flyer, gives a bird view of the entire city, the compartments are very comfortable its a major tourist attraction in Singapore",,,
,,Best experience ever - Singapore Flyer,5,,"In my Singapore travel during Nov 2015, I have visited Singapore Flyer. Its really fascinating experience when you reach to the top of the Flyer, it gives 360 degree view of Singapore. You can see Seaside, Marina bay and Concert Auditorium in the middle of ocean. Flyer is not much expensive. Person must have to have such experience once in a lifetime",,,
,,Fantastic,5,,Fantastic views of Singapore ..beautiful to look at at night ...it's a great part of Singapore not to be missed,,,
,,"Fun, but not essential.",4,,"We enjoyed our Singapore Flyer ride early one Saturday morning. There is no commentary, so thank goodness for the friendly local we shared a capsule with, who pointed out the landmarks. It was a fun outing, but I wouldn't call it a must do.",,,
,,Good Thing to do Once,4,,"The ride is very smooth and stable, no wobbles. The views were really great. We shared our pod with a family and we took pictures for each other so that was nice. It took 30 minutes to rotate through the cycle and that was a good amount of time. Probably wouldn't do it again as it is a bit expensive, but am glad I did it once.",,,
,,Disappointing,3,,"Went there, its starting to look like a product that is soon to be discarded. Sad for something that started out promising, retail and dining haphazard and poor. Looks like filling the space is more important than thinking about choices for guests.",,,
,,Best way to see the Singapore,5,,Wonderful view of the marina and they had Christmas music piped in. It take 1/2 hour to do one rotation. Enjoyed the whole experience. Would recommend the Flyer.,,,
,,Lucky with no queue,5,,"We arrived just after a thunderstorm so the flyer had been closed. We walked straight in and straight onto the flyer because of this. As is typical the rain clouds quickly cleared making great views of the bay and city alike.

The pod was suitably filled giving everyone a seat and ample space to move around.

Highly recommended for anyone with a head for heights!",,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,"During our last visit, its our first time we went for singapore flyer with the recommendation on TRIP ADVISOR. Its worth to do 32 min ride. Breath taking view from the top.",,,
,,Great Views of Singapore,5,,This was a wonderful experience giving you a overall view of the very modern Singapore. We were there in November so no long Queues,,,
,,Great place for a view,4,,"I had booked tickets for this before I arrived in Singapore which saved me a little money and also tied me to a date to visit.
Unfortunately as I arrived on the day, the Flyer had just been closed due to impending thunderstorms and so I was forced to wait, however these did not clear and so I decided to return the following day.
I asked a staff member if I could use the ticket the following day as it did have a specific date on and was assured it would be fine.
I returned the next day and presented my ticket, only to be questioned about the date to which I explained my reasons. This wasn't an issue and I was allowed to proceed.
The ride itself takes about 30 minutes and gives a good view across Singapore.
I had been at the top of Marina Bay the previous day and so in some respects it was a very similar view and also not as high up.
The location of the Flyer is a bit of a commercial centre with shops and restaurants which are handy if you have to wait for weather to clear.
Good experience of you want an aerial view.",,,
,,Excellent view of the city,4,,Worth to go and don't forget be there at night ..further there are restaurants in the same building..,,,
,,Amazing!,5,,The Singapore Flyer in that second tallest Ferris wheel in the world. It gave amazing 360 views and just gave an amazing and beautiful view of the whole entire city. A must visit!!,,,
,,Nice. But not perfect.,3,,Good views from here but there are many places in Singapore with great views. The trip is kind of quick and the price is high. Plus I think we were supposed to have Christmas music the whole time but the music cut in and out and made some static noises in between. But the most pleasant. Also the wondrous get smudged easily from previous riders so some areas are hard to take clear photos. Just ok.,,,
,,eye of singapore,5,,Best views in evening... .. Good ride for half an hour.. and then try restaurants on first floors ..,,,
,,Wonderful view of Singapore,5,,"We visited the Singapore Flyer in a Friday evening around 6.30 PM, glad it was less crowded at that time and it was a perfect time since it became dark when we were at the top of the flyer. We could see the beautiful view of the city, Harbor as well as the Gardens by the Bay which was colorful with the lights.",,,
,,Good experience,4,,It is worth visiting for the view it offers. There is nothing overly outstanding about this place but still recommended for the view of Singapore it offers.,,,
,,great views,5,,"Second highest in the world and the views proved it, no queues during the week so we had a capsule to ourselves brilliant views across Singapore",,,
,,Lots of better ways to enjoy the view,2,,"We were quite excited about going on the flyer as we read a lot of positive reviews and their website made it seem like this was an experience not to be missed. Unfortunately, it was the total opposite. The place was quite dead on a Saturday night. There was no queue or massive throngs of people waiting to get on the flyer. The staff manning the lines of people getting on or off the flyer looked bored. It was just 5 of us in our pod. While I do admit that the view is quite pretty, it wasn鈥檛 so stunning that you needed to pay $33 for it. There are many other ways to enjoy the view, like roof top bars or skyscrapers/skyrise buildings nearby. The entire 30 minute ride was slow and boring. Initially, we were contemplating on buying the Premium Champagne Flight tickets 鈥?luckily we changed our minds at the last minute. That would have been a complete waste of $69. I wouldn鈥檛 recommend this ride to anyone and based on the very few people we saw that night (it was a weekend), they don鈥檛 seem to be attracting that much of a crowd.",,,
,,Worth it to orientate yourself,4,,Great views of the Marina Bay Area and Bloom Gardens. I found the experience worth it to appreciate the size of Bloom Gardens along with the distance and direction other attractions are apart from each other - eg Merlion Park. My husband was attending a conference in Singapore so I went on my own. Shared a carriage with a lovely family and found that the flyer had orientated me well enough for a quick scoot around to the other Singapore attractions with my husband the next day.,,,
,,Best experience at night,5,,"Singapore flyer is a nice experience and offers 360 degrees views of marina bay and gardens by the bay. At night looks really amazing, at day time is great for pictures. Standing at a stunning 165m, Singapore Flyer is the height of a 42-storey building 鈥?that鈥檚 some 30 metres taller than the famed London Eye. Taking a flight on this S$240 million wheel is a one-of-a-kind experience you wouldn鈥檛 want to miss.",,,
,,What a view,5,,So smooth you hardly feel you are moving.Stunning views of Singapore for almost 30 minutes.Next time I will try it at night.,,,
,,Whole of Singapore in 30 minutes!,5,,Fun 30 minutes ride in the Singapore Flyer. One can see Singapore at a glance from the Flyer. Its a must activity to be done if you love you see city from height. It Looks beautiful!!!,,,
,,Unbelievable!,5,,This place cannot be described by words...There is only about 7-10 pax seating & standing space so there is privacy and great view. The Ferris Wheel is as tall as 2 male girrafes standing on each other(41 meters tall!) Thanks Singapore Flyer!,,,
,,Kinda overpriced.,3,,I guess this would be worth doing once for the touristy kinda people. The view of the city was pretty nice.,,,
,,Beautiful View,5,,"It was owesome place to be and you can view the beautiful building,roads,park by the bay also lots of boat and duck tour boat by river",,,
,,360 view from top.,5,,"We were very apprehensive about giant wheels.But this has a/c cabin,completes a circle in 45 min & you get the best all round view of Singapore.A must for every visitor as this is the largest flyer in the world.",,,
,,Very similar to The London Eye but with tropical views,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is in a beautiful bayside location. It is set in it's own park and has a mini shopping & food mall built into the infrastructure. The ticketing booth advertises prices for adults, children and seniors over 60 at a reduced price. When we attempted to buy a senior ticket for me (66), we were told that offer was only for locals, not foreigners. I was a little upset by the bluntness but went ahead and bought tickets anyway.
The ride itself lasts for around 40 minutes with spectacular panoramic views of the Bay Harbour Sands, Botanical Gardens, and the centre of Singapore's financial quarter.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"We visited the flyer early in the morning. There was hardly any waiting, and we had great clear view of entire Singapore- well maintained roads, busy port, and good view of the sea.",,,
,,Wow!!!!,5,,If you're lucky enough to visit Singapore then a trip on the Singapore Flyer is a must. The views are amazing and you can see for miles. Go early to avoid the queues.,,,
,,Big ferris wheel,3,,Presents great views of Singapore and it is a relaxing and safe half hour ride but nothing more than that.,,,
,,eye catching,5,,the slow speed that the wheel goes round enables you to get a fantastic panoramic view of Singapore.,,,
,,Super excellent,5,,This is a must do wen u visit Singapore. The view from the flyer is spectacular. U can't decide which side to look at. the special dinning experience is just too romantic. Singapore is one of the most happening countries.,,,
,,Great views!,5,,"One of the worlds biggest ferris wheels and well worth doing. Cost of admission was $33 SD per adult. Takes about 30 minutes to go around and the scenery is spectacular. The capsules are air conditioned, there is seating for 12 in each but can hold up to 28 people.
This is one of the cool things to do in Marina Bay and I highly recommend it but probably not so good if it's raining.",,,
,,Beautiful views,4,,As with the London eye it takes a very long time to get round but the views are fantastic and I don't feel it's badly priced either,,,
,,Great View During Night,4,,"We went there around the time of sunset. You have to plan if you want to see the skyline during daylight or with night lights. Loved the view of skyline with lights and all. The whole thing was like 30 mins to 45 mins. There are also options to dine in these capsule. If there is less crowd, they can have a whole capsule for your group (if you are 5 + people. Otherwise capsule can have like 10 people easily).",,,
,,great views,3,,"this was for me and my 4 year old son. we went VIA metro and got there 45 minutes before the time we got on, you buy your tickets for a specific time slot. so ours was 45 minutes.
the wait is not bad, there are some retstaurants and a Malay street food section which is nice for Foodies like us.
Also to kill time under the giant ferris wheel is a nice sized Koi pond that kids and grown ups can enjoy. also a feeder to buy food from for 1 Singapore dollar for kids to feed the Koi.
once on board the wheel its a around a 15 minute ride with great views from the start. you can see all of Singapore if the weather is not Smoggy! the ride doesnt stop for rain unless its windy and stormy.
overall it was nice and the capsules are large and spacious
great Photo opportunities and enough time for that too !",,,
,,spectacular night view,5,,"took the flyer at the evening time, it was so smooth and you did not even feel it was moving. it is a perfect place to have the best colorful Singapore under your sight.",,,
,,Worth the visit,5,,"We loved the Singapore Flyer - a very relaxing way to see the expanses of Singapore, especially all lit up at night.",,,
,,Great view from the top,5,,"I have been on this attraction 3 times now, with different people, and have enjoyed the ride and the view. Not cheap, but good value. Only go when there are clear skies or at night so as you can enjoy all the lights.",,,
,,It's a must in singapore,5,,"If you go to Singapore, YOU HAVE TO TO GO THE FLYER!!! Amazing! Great view of the city. The whole round takes 30 minutes and it's just perfect.",,,
,,Not cheap but great views!,4,,"Lovely experience , very Organised . Had to wait until the fog cleared before we could get on. It was worth the wait. Adults about $33, children $21 so it can be pricey for a family but there was a family deal for residents.

Our very nervous seven year old loved it! No fear at all.

Takes about 30 mins to rotate. We could even see our home.

I'll go again with guests or friends especially if there are any special offers.

Tip, make sure the weather forcast is ideal or you may have a long wait until ( flights ) are resumed.

You can also book a dining pod at night. That would be very romantic and dramatic. I suspect a perfect venue for a proposal.",,,
,,Great view - your choice (either Singapore flyer or straight onto MBS sky deck),4,,"Great view from the tallest wheel of the world, your choice (either Singapore flyer or straight onto MBS sky deck) - both have a great view over Singapore.",,,
,,Great Views in the evening,4,,It's just one of those things you have to do when in Singapore. You can buy a ticket in advance to go on the Flyer any time during the day so it is a good way to avoid queuing. They don't put too many people in each capsule which is great.,,,
,,Great way to spot the places you want to visit,5,,Good money spent - don't forget to take your camera and go around to dusk to watch the sun set - perfect.,,,
,,Nothing Special,3,,Location : Easy access by MRT. Price : Average. Will Visit Again : No. Cleanliness : Good View : Good.,,,
,,It was not as scary as thought,5,,We decided to go one the Singapore Flyer on the first day we were in Singapore to help us orientate ourselves with the city. We found the view amazing and it also helped orientate us. We went late afternoon and we found we didn't have to wait very long to get on the Flyer. I recommend this attraction to people of all ages.,,,
,,Good overview of the city,4,,"This was the highest observation in the wheel, it has now been outdone by Dubai. It is still an interesting ride with some great views over the city.",,,
,,Breathtaking views by day and by night!,4,,"Fabulous views at any time of the day. Night time is prettier, with night charge ticket applicable from 6 pm onwards. A definite one time visit, or more!",,,
,,Another wheel,3,,"I've been to a few of these and unless you have at least two hours to spare...Because of the smoke from the forest burning in Indonesia, the visibility was limited.",,,
,,High rise view of Singapore,5,,It is an excellent addition in Singapore. The flyer is about a 30 min ride from where entire Singapore can be viewed and it is just beautiful. Not advisable to avail the option of dining/drinking in Flyer as it is expensive.,,,
,,WOW!,5,,"The 32 minute ride lets you really take in the imoressibe marina, the buildings and the gardens. Better to go at dusk. Imreally enjoyed it.",,,
,,Not bad view,3,,Best time to board is at approximately 6.40pm. This is the best time when the sun will set and on top of that you will see the lightings slowly light up. The ride takes about 30 mins so remember to visit the toilet first. (Information from a hotel concierge around that area(me)).,,,
,,Its ok,4,,I had the dinner on the flyer. The food that was served was ok. I think it was two rotations and the dinner service was over.,,,
,,Singapore flyer in cloudy day,4,,"We bought ticket in advance and have only 3 days to go in SG, the singapore flyer also in one of our plan. We went there but unfortunately the flyer are temporary stop service due to cloudy sky!!!! Not even rain but we are so disappoint because plan to see the city in day time. So we go to another place and came back later and it's dark to take photo and the light from another cabin always attack our camera.

But we can see garden by the bay during the lighting show from the cabin ^^",,,
,,nice,4,,"Singapore Flyer is a giant Ferris wheel in Singapore. It has 28 air conditioned capsules, each able to accommodate 28 passengers. A complete trip lasts approximately 32 minutes.The view from the flyer is mindboggling as one can literally see all of the Singapore. The capsules are well protected and one would have the sense of safety even while being at quite a height. It might feel kind of monotonous after a while but for a one-time experience, it鈥檚 definitely an 鈥榓dd-to鈥?the list. I loved it and will go everytime i visit Singapore. A must see!",,,
,,Enjoyed a lot .,3,,Fine must experience. Enjoy Singapore from height.u will see hotel garden by bay .bridge. Unique experience,,,
,,Get the Singapore Sling experience,5,,A little more expensive but you get a lovely sling and skip the queues! Lovely views of Singapore and the F1 track. You can see Indonesia (and maybe Malaysia) on a good day.,,,
,,Unique Experience,5,,This Flyer is bigger than London eye. It is give nice view of Singapore and you enjoy the ride as this moves at very slow speed.,,,
,,Not all that,2,,Not quite all that in bag of cheap. A drink at any of the plenty roof top bars will do the trick. Is overpriced for what you and and not a must do attractions while you are in Singapore,,,
,,Catch the Singapore Skyline from the Flyer,5,,"We had the chance to see the Singapore Skyline both during day light and at night. We got into the flyer 30 minutes before sunset and experienced wonderful views of the bay and the Singapore Skyline. As the sunset and the Singapore Skyline lit-up, it was a sight to behold.",,,
,,A must-do but just another wheel really.,4,,"We were glad that we did the flyer, but it wasn't a highlight of our trip. A It is situated in a good position to get great views allow over the island. It's a must - do while in Singapore, but in the end it's just another big wheel.",,,
,,Great view from the top,5,,"Never forget the view from the top of the singapore flyer, even though it is quite scary before entering the capsule (because it looks so high from below)",,,
,,Sight seeing,4,,Good place to watch in the heart of the city. The night view was excellent. My children like a lot. It gives the city a very handy look and jo need to spend lonely on this where you can see when you are in a taxi.,,,
,,A wonderful experience,5,,The Singapore Flyer is strategically located to offer stunning views of the marina and the city. Definetly a wonderful experience!,,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,"One of the best ways to take in the beauty of this hard working tiny island nation is to hop into a cozy cabin of the Singapore flyer. You see everything from the Singapore race track to the Singapore river, the busy financial district with the tall office buildings to the drinking districts of Singapore. It is a beautiful ride, will take about 20 minutes for the ride itself - but since there are queues for the ride, the overall getting-in, getting-out experience may take about 1-2 hours.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer - fun experience,5,,The flyer is a great way to get an aerial view of Singapore. The cars are large and move slowly. You get plenty of time to take photos.,,,
,,Fantastic views of the city and the harbour,4,,This is a great way of showing your friends your favourite city. It is fabulous and you will appreciate harbour and city growth like nowhere else.,,,
,,Like it!,4,,Like to ride it! you can enjoy the great view of Singapore city from the top point. If you take ride in night then you will be pampered with the beautiful lights of the cities. Beautiful!,,,
,,Relaxing way to see everything!,5,,"Best way to end a long day of sightseeing; there are a few packages to choose from but the basic ticket was still great. Views are stunning at night that's a given, but the way this is designed is excellent! Pods seat up to 14ppl but we only had 10 so that was fine. Still plenty of room to roam around and see everything.",,,
,,One time experience is a must.,5,,"Take your ride on a bright sunny day. If can plan a dinner and can afford to spend S$270 for a couple, you can have a nice ride.",,,
,,Waste of time,1,,This is just a big wheel turning in a slow circle. There is nothing much to do. A visit to any of the restaurants in the skyscrapers around Marina Bay would give as good a view. Not worth the time or the money.,,,
,,Best View of Singapore,3,,This is something you must do if you are in Singapore just so you can say you did it! :) But it also provides great views of the city. I recommend taking the tram at night to enjoy all the beautiful city lights.,,,
,,Too short and extremely expensive,3,,"It takes only half an hour but it costs 33 SGD. The view is beautiful, especially after sunset, but when you would start to enjoy it after taking your pictures, it's already over. And then you step out and they want to sell you a picture of you and the flyer for as much as 25 SGD. It's pretty expensive but you can have a dinner there, than it's an hour.",,,
,,Amazing view,4,,"We had a family get together in Singapore and decided to do the Singapore flyer at night.....how gorgeous was the view. The lights were amazing. Did not go slow apparently it takes 30+minutes, there was so much to look at that the time went quick. Not too busy either we went bout 7.30-8pm perfect. Well worth a look if you are in this beautiful city",,,
,,Beautiful Views of the City,5,,"This is a really fun way to see the city, even though I am afraid of heights, I really enjoyed it. The ride took approximately 20 minutes. We did this as part of an eight hour layover.",,,
,,Good views from here! (If no haze.),5,,"You can see Marina bay and lots of place around from here. When I was in SG, there were haze in the city so It's hard to see the views clearly.",,,
,,"Nice views, beautiful experience",4,,Its a lovely 30 minute ride to view Singapore from atop. Nice experience and a great photo opportunity for tourists.,,,
,,Great views of Marina Bay,5,,"Great views of the whole of Marina Bay area! Large capsules, comfortably fitting approx 10 people at a time. Ride lasted 30 minutes and well priced. Right outside of F1 Pit lane, which was very happy about.

Only complaint was all capsules full of Christmas window stickers at the moment, which obstructed some of the views out of the doors!",,,
,,"Fantastic view of the Marina, city, and Seacoast!",5,,"It gives a unique aerial perspective of the Marina and all the venues around it, the Gardens, the harbor. If timed right, it might be a great spot to watch the light show over the Marina. You could also have a quick snack in the 30 minute ride. A car was set up with tables and chairs. Took the Hop On Hop Off bus to get there. There is also part of a night tour.",,,
,,Definitely worth going at night,4,,"We went at 9:00 pm and the views were spectacular. If you plan to take pictures, take a seat at the corner as you can turn from left to right when the cabine changes side.
In order to avoid reflection press the camera against the window.
The souvenir pictures they take from you are expansive (35$ for 2) but are a really nice memory (and not as kitschy as usually ).
When you leave, walk towards the river as you have a great photo opportunity to get the Flyer real close. Look to the opposite side of the river are the illuminated flowers of the Gardens by the Sea.",,,
,,Another Giant Ferris Wheel,4,,"Giant wheels are becoming pretty ubiquitous any more, with every tourist destination rushing to add one. I think this might still have been the tallest when we were ther, but I understand taller ones are under construction. Be that as it may, this is a relaxing (and air-conditioned) way to get a good overview of downtown Singapore and the Marina Bay area. I don't remember how much it cost, but it wasn't exactly cheap. But, I would spend the money on the Singapore Flyer, before I would spend it on some other attractions. Recommended",,,
,,"It was pretty good, nice view, sort of",3,,"This was one of those things that you have to do so you can say ""Yes"" when you get back home and everyone asks, ""Did you go on the London eye of Singapore"". Nice ride just like the London eye, but it was November and for some reason Singapore likes to put up Christmas decorations early... Well some low paid genious at the Flyer decided that decorating up all the viewing windows with this large cloudy snowflakes and massive christmas trees was a ""Good idea""...well not when the main feature of this attraction is the view, you morons!!!! Crowded enough as it is and there is always jockeying for position for that perfect photo, but now you have to avoid the snowflakes too...TAKE THEM DOWN!!!!",,,
,,Singapore Flyer best views of City,5,,"Done the Singapore Flyer while staying at the iBiz Hotel
best views of the city from the top, also look over the famous
Marina Bay Sands an iconic resort from the top of the ride
Its a must if you visit Singapore.
Hop on Off bus stops there.",,,
,,The mandatory ferris wheel,3,,"All big cities with any self respect need a ferris wheel, right? So, this is Singapore's take and its located very well for overlooking the area around lower Raffles Avenue.",,,
,,High,5,,If you don't like heights this is not for you. If you don't mind then it is spectacular. Beautiful views you can see for ever.,,,
,,amazing view of Singapore city,5,,"If in Singapore and you do not do one ride on the Singapore flyer you have definitely missed an opportunity, the view from the capsules are astounding, a bit overpriced for the duration but it is worth a ride",,,
,,Unique experience,4,,It takes about an hour to complete the round and I recommend you to take ride in night. From top point it gives magnificent view of the Singapore city.,,,
,,Ok but a bit dull,3,,I am not sure why we all jump onto the fliers and spend a very slow circuit looking at not a great view. For what it is - it's fine - but ...,,,
,,Amazed at the Views!,5,,"Would admit initial scepticism about going on the Flyer, but once there we realised that this was going to be a most interesting experience! We went in the early evening with dusk approaching, and this - to us was a great time to go as we could see the city before the lights came on, and then viewed it all as the lights and the nigh came over Singapore - fabulous! The views are spectacular, and the roomy 'cabins' allowed you to wander around to view from all sides. The time that we went may have been a quieter time - and this I feel was a good idea - no queues and time to enjoy a Tiger in the food hall before hand. Highly recommend this attraction.",,,
,,biggest gaint wheel,4,,"The flyer is well maintained and is ver near to the marine bay . One may choose the normal cabin to romantic cabin , the rates would vary accordingly.",,,
,,A serendipity,5,,I came here during my boyfriend's birthday with his parents and it was one of the most wonderful experience i had in singapore! We had to go into a special entrance and the immersion prior to entering the cart itself was cool. There are various displays and information about the flyer. It adds on to the anticipation of riding the flyer. Afterwards we had to queue up for a short while. I wasn't expecting a lot because we had to share carts with other people but it is so huge that i think it can fit up to 20 people and we got abt 12 so the place was still pretty spacious! Slowly but surely you see yourself rising up and up and the view of singapore city started to fill up. From various corner of the carts you can see different atmosphere of the view if singapore. It's wonderful and therapeutic. It was a very calming and enjoyable experience. Ascending up was so excitinf especially when you reached the highest point of the flyer. I went during the day so you can totally see everything :) highly recommended!!,,,
,,Like watching paint dry.,3,,They thought that they were being unique by placing big snowflakes and Christmas trees on the panes of window which you must look out to see the scenery. It is nice to ride around in get a 360 view of the city from that point. It is not as interesting as the similar attraction in London.,,,
,,A bit pricey but spectacular views,4,,"The price was a bit high for a 30 minute ride, but the views of Singapore are amazing. We were lucky to get a cabin all to ourselves.",,,
,,Nice view from the top!,4,,"Beautiful views of SG from the top! Would love to go back for a nighttime or sunset ride.

During peak hours/days, staff would fill the car so tourists will normally be grouped with strangers. But since we went there on a weekday afternoon, we were lucky to have the whole cabin to ourselves.

Not much good food choices in the Flyer. There are cafes at the entrance and a ""food village"" for more filling meals. Better to eat somewhere else after the ride.",,,
,,Great view of Singapore and beyond,5,,Love watching the entire city and beyond from this amazing attraction. Been on it 4 times and still keep going back :) It gives a you a great day and night view and you can see Malaysia too :),,,
,,Best 360degree view of Singapore,5,,This is truly amazing. Must do. Takes about 30mins for each 'Flight' which is one full rotation. It doesn't stop. Hop on and it goes around once so slowly that it doesn't feel like your moving so no feeling sick.,,,
,,Really good!,5,,Actually we did not plan to visit this. The price is quite high and I'm a bit scared to heights. Spontaneous we decided to do it anyway and we did not regret this decision. The view over the Marina bay is fantastic. Also it's really safe. There wasn't a moment I had any problems due to the height.,,,
,,Great views,5,,well worth it as it was a nice day and we could see a lot I think as it was September we got on straight away,,,
,,What a view,5,,Great way to see the city and surrounds. The view as your carriage travels up and over the top is the most amazing thing to see.,,,
,,nice experience,5,,it looks scary but actually you will feel safe inside! My 3 1/2 year old son just loved it. there are friendly staff to guide you and to attend on your needs,,,
,,Not worth!!!,3,,"its nice to be at the top of the wheel and see around entire Singapore, but its not worth 70 dollars..you can see Singapore skyline from Marina Bay also....the flyer was very slow moving and takes around 40 min to complete a round.

good place to click pictures...but I felt not worth spending 70 odd dollars.",,,
,,This was pretty cool,4,,I went with my girlfriend and it was pretty cool. Even the surrounding area was nice as it was surround by a small garden. It gives you a great view of the city and goes very slow so you have time to see everything. Felt very safe.,,,
,,What a sight!,4,,It's a must for everyone. The wheel so massive and moves slowly enough for you to really take in every aspect. Maybe best for adults due to glass and height.,,,
,,A must while in Singapore,4,,"Really one of the things You must do while visiting Singapore. I would suggest to do it in the evening, then the view will be even more amazing.

While we did our round it was not too crowded but it probably won't be the case all the time.",,,
,,Must go,5,,"Try to go in the night
Its a very fine place and non-stop
If u have a group than u should go but if u r single or a wedded couple u could give it a miss .
35 minute ride and an overhead view of singapore
Worth the money if u have people with u alone u will feel it like a car ride",,,
,,Great night view of Singapore - worth the effort,4,,We timed our ride so that the sky tree light display was on and it looked fantastic from the slow moving Flyer. The views of the Marina Bay are also great at night. A must do when in Singapore.,,,
,,"The only way to go, around",5,,This was a wonderful experience. Can't remember but think it took about 30 mins to do the loop. And make sure you have plenty of space on the camera memory card.,,,
,,Wonder device to see whole singapore,5,,"Singapore flier is very good device to enjoy Singapore seating in a air conditioned cabin. It is really enjoyable. If you don't as yet enjoy the taste of Singapore flier , my foremost advice to enjoy the Singapore flier. It will really give u an excellent enjoyment",,,
,,Must do,5,,Our outing on the flyer was pretty impromptu and it was worth it. Gives you a good aerial view of the city.,,,
,,Great views but not worth it,3,,"if you're interested in city skylines, getting an idea where everything is, and the dizzy feeling of height, you could probably visit a hotel bar or restaurant on the top of another skyscraper and relax with a cocktail for the price of bringing your family here. Over fifty dollars for one adult and one child for a twenty minute spin was too much to pay. Children are likely to be either afraid of the glass walls and fall in the viewing pods or uninterested in the view of buildings. It's a lot of money to pay to be trapped for any amount of time with a bored child so if you really want to try the flyer maybe just leave the kids out of it.",,,
,,Excellent!!!,5,,"huge, amazing and larger than life..thats flyer for you...worth visiting, but photos of flyer will look good only from a distance..closeup views cannot accomodate such a massive structure..so just have a visit and have photos with flyer in background..we didint go for the ride inside ..have heard its slow and not intidimating..worth a second visit then..",,,
,,Breathtaking views,5,,"It is a must to see Singapore from this giant fairies wheel capsules. The beauty and penoramic view of the skyline the glittering effect of the bay area, floating performing stage, Esplanade theater etc. was very pleasing at night time. They have dinning options as well but we didn't opted.
It's timing are 8:30 AM to 10:30 PM and cost Singaporian$ 33/adult.",,,
,,Excellent View of Singapore,4,,This is must to have full sky view of Singapore. You can see Marina Bay Sands on one side. Gives you great feeling.,,,
,,Nice way to spend 30 minutes,4,,Was a good way to see the city at night. The haze made visibility not so good but still worth a spin.,,,
,,Night view is beautiful,4,,"It's better to visit at night as the night scene is much beautiful with all the lightings around. You can try to buy online in advance , may get a better deals with some credit cards promotions.",,,
,,Great views,5,,One of the attractions that must be visited by all tourists. Great views of the Singapore skyline!!! Reasonably priced!,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,The wheel moved very slowly allowing you to take in the city landscape. The views were excellent but make sure you pick a clear day.,,,
,,A Grand View Of The City,5,,We spend 30 minutes on the Flyer and it was breath taking. You are contained in a very comfortable indoor cage and get to see the whole of the city and beyond Its expensive but worth it,,,
,,good views,4,,Go on a good day. Views of Singapore are great. Go on a week day out of season and get your own private pod.,,,
,,Felt Like A Child Again,5,,"After walking around, we spotted this huge wheel and decided to try it on. The experience was exquisitely fun. Though my mum was shaking due tp her fear of heights. The museum provided information on how the wheel was built, what it is made of and so on. You can enjoy the view of SG's beauty.",,,
,,Views as expected,4,,"The views are truly good. As we were going in at late evening there was almost no queue to the flyer. As the ride takes 30min there is plenty of time to take pictures and look over the main sights around the bay. The surrounding of the flyer could be better organized, although there are few restaurants and amenities in the flyer building.",,,
,,Once is enough,4,,"Took a friend who was in town on a ride. Since it was the afternoon, there was no queue. But the staff tried to pack each capsule with visitors which is unnecessary.",,,
,,Wonderful overview in Singapore,5,,Once you're in the cabin you will overlook Singapore in a very unique way. For 20 min utes you can relax; standing or sitting in an open looked way. Very nice for children as well.,,,
,,Best view of Singapore.,5,,"We visited flyer in the morning. It was less crowded and hence less people in one capsule. Got the 360 degree view of marina bay and rest of Singapore.

30 min ride will be full of different view from the sky. And you will have numerous chances to click the pic.

I am not sure about how the view will be in the night but I had a great time in the early morning.",,,
,,Stunning View of Singapore,4,,We went at night and the view of Singapore is absolutely beautiful. The Singapore Flyer goes slow which gives you time to take photos and absorb the view of Singapore. I would recommend going on the Flyer. Well worth it. There are restaurants around the Flyer and entertainment.,,,
,,Chose a clear day,5,,We were lucky that the smoke haze on the day we 'flew' was not too bad so visibility was okay. Great views of the new Gardens by the Bay and of the Marina Bay Sands. It was not busy so there were only 6 of us in the gondola.,,,
,,Not a must in Singapore,3,,"It was ok and the views were great. However, I would not say that it is a must do if you come to Singapore. Tickets were well priced however and it was nice to be in our own pod.",,,
,,nice experiance,4,,visited with family. nice to see all other Singapore tourist places from top. wish to visit again. 100 % value of money,,,
,,Wow experience,5,,A must do. Fabulous views. Very close to Gardens by the bay and Maina Bay Sands. Gives great opportunity to get a different prospective. Very relaxing you barely feel it moving.,,,
,,Great View! Don't even know you are moving!,5,,I purchased the Champagne ride and it was great! They whisk you to your own car and my fianc茅 were the only ones in the car so it was great! Go at night as the views are awesome! I highly recommend the flyer when you visit Singapore.,,,
,,Brilliant experience.,5,,"I recently along with my wife, daughter and two family friends took a ride on the Singapore flyer and we all agreed it was an excellent experience. According to the reading material on the way to the actual ride it is the second highest big wheel in the world, i'm not sure if this still the case.
At the time we went it was'nt very busy and we got the car to ourselves which was nice.
The ride travels very slowly round and dos'nt actually stop not even when you get on or off but it's really not a problem for anyone as it's going so slow.
As it makes it's way around and the city reveals it's self before you the views are absolutely fantastic, every way you look there is something even more spectacular than the last thing you were looking at. The photo opportunities are just endless.
The only thing higher than the flyer is the Marina Bay Sands Skypark which i recommend everyone also takes a trip to the top of.",,,
,,Fun visit,5,,The Flyer had great views and was a clean ride and being proposed to on it was amazing! The thought of eating on one cart was pretty cool. I only wish it wasn't over $200.00,,,
,,Amazing view!!!!,5,,"First time ever in singapore, first time ever in the wheel!!!! We chose to visit during the night, the view was spectacular!!!!! Only wished to have a better camera for pictures :( totaly recomand it, totaly worth it!!!!",,,
,,The 1st part of the trip,4,,"This location has the world famous Marina Bay Sands hotel and some other attractions too. It is very mesmerising to view all the attractions from the top and enjoy the slow ride.

It is not so crowded and very good location for photos. The best activity for day time.",,,
,,Leisure,5,,Leisure sightseeing. . Went there to have dinner at the retro restaurant there.. great place to hang out with friends and family and ride the flyer!!,,,
,,view,5,,probably it would be for the view that we took it. once is good enough to catch the glimpse of singapore's night view. you may want to catch other timings for sunset too!,,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"We had one night on a stop over and picked one attraction to visit. We were very impressed, booked online for a sponsored experience where you book the whole capsule to yourself (can't recall the total price but it was very reasonable for such an experience). We enjoyed a private checkin, no queue, walked straight into our own 'Mo毛t & Chandon' capsule with our Singapore sling cocktails and mocktails for the kids. You can plug in your own iPod if you don't like their choice and whack up the volume for a private party while you take in the sights.",,,
,,Overrated,3,,"The best part of the Singapore Flyer is seeing it from a distance, a huge imposing wheel with lights of changing colors, casting a mirror image on the water spanning beside it. But paying for the ticket for a slow ride on it is nothing spectacular. You do get a good view of the city, but it's not really worth the price.",,,
,,Candlelight dinner,4,,There was other 3 couples in the same capsule that i took but somehow it was still romantic. Food was amazing but was quite disappointed with the drinks. Good scenery. Service was okay.. My partner and I enjoyed ourself!,,,
,,Good view but overpriced,3,,Too overpriced for the return that one gets. About SGD10 should be ideal for the value given. Marina bay sands gives better view but that is expensive too,,,
,,A birds eye view of Singapore,5,,"Built just like the London eye, standing at 165 meters, this the place to see the all of Singapore. From the top you can get a view of the entire island of Singapore. The Marina bay hotel looks awesome and the Singapore river is mercerising from that height.

A must do in Singapore, unless of course you have been on the London eye",,,
,,Great view across Singapore and beyond on a clear day.,4,,I'm a real chicken when it comes to heights and this did scare me a little before we went on but it was fine. They operate very smoothly and it doesn't even feel like you are moving. I did feel a little funny to walk around so most of the time I just sat. It only goes for 30 minutes also which is good. Not too long.,,,
,,a day in singapore,3,,very beautiful landmark and enjoyed a lot for Singapore flyer. is good for my family vacation and I'll come back again..,,,
,,A Singapore Must-Do,5,,"The trip on the Singapore Flyer is easy to arrange and easy to access. There is no problem in getting on and off. The ride becomes spectacular in itself as well as providing wonderful views over the CBD and beyond, Marina Bay, Marina Sands, Gardens on the Bay, Sentosa Island and out to sea. The area below contains a great variety of food and drink in pleasant surroundings.",,,
,,Do it twice; day and night.,5,,"By day, you see the the city-scape of the island city, and its very well planted infrastructure. Most of the streets you see from the bird's eye view are covered in greenery, which is amazing. By night, the view you see becomes totally different. The illumination from the skyscrapers outline the skyline of the city, a romantic sight, especially when there is no one else sharing the capsule you are in.",,,
,,Better view at night,5,,Good -Goes around slow so you get to see plenty -Can see the pretty city lights -No queue when I went - I went at the end of F1 race so I saw the circuit lit up Bad -Little expensive,,,
,,Great Views of Singapore,5,,"This attraction takes about an hour and allows plenty of photo opportunities. Although we took it in the morning, it would be especially wonderful at night.",,,
,,flyer visit,5,,"we booked this as part of our hopper bus ticket, we also got the bus on water and night bus tour and aquarium tour. the busses are really good. the view from the fler was amazing and felt as though we were going to be as high as the sands bay hotel which as it resembles a ship suspended in the air was a fantastic sight from up high aas well as the view from the ground. take video whilst up in the flyer as it gives you the most amazing panaramic view",,,
,,"Nice, cozy",4,,"Flyer is almost a symbol of Singapore so even if you have been to similar ride elsewhere, you must visit it. Not much crowded. Has large enough cabins to seat over ten people in each. Gives a panoramic view of city. The restaurant in one of the cars is costly but has its own experience.",,,
,,great views os singapore,5,,"great attraction in fantastic location ! once we arrived we bypassed the ticket office as we had our tickets already .
you go up an escalator passing through an in depth display of Singapore bay area through it's short history.
after having the obligatory souvenir photo you are led up towards the PODS .
there were a couple of large family groups going on the flyer. but they were allowed to have a pod to themselves as it wasn't busy .
my wife and I were ushered on to a pod with 4 other couples {they can hold up to 16/18 people, so we had plenty of space to walk around the pod ,taking in the views and taking loads of photos of the bay area AND the pit lane of the Singapore grand prix { which is directly to the side of the flyer }
we were in the pod around 30 minutes ,but if seams a lot longer !!!
the pods have fantastic AIR CON inside the pods ,which due to the temperature and humidity
we would recommend this attraction

PLEASE NOTE
we went on the flyer in the daytime and again in the evening, and both times are just as good as each other",,,
,,Definitely worth the money,5,,"We paid $33 each to venture onto the Singapore Flyer and what can I say other than it is thoroughly worth it. The views from the top are extordinary, although similar views can be obtained from the Skypark I feel this is better value for money. The area itself is beautiful and I can't see how anyone cannot enjoy a walk around the harbour. Situated next to the Singapore F1 pit lane and closed sections of the F1 track with clear views over the city harbour and the east coast park it is truly beautiful. A short walk from the raffles hotel and the Fullerton nearer town where you can enjoy the delights of the more colonial / historic buildings.",,,
,,"Highly priced, Guideless ""Singapore Eye""",3,,"The so called ""Singapore Flyer"" id rival to the ""London Eye"". The Singapore wheel is ostensibly taller than the London one. However, as the giant wheel is located at the edge of the city as opposed to it's centre, there is not much to see. Don't get me wrong, the Flyer is an engineering marvel, not only because it's built so near to the sea and it's so tall. It is let down because of it's priciness and the lack of a guide (even electronic) to let you know what you are seeing, in which direction.",,,
,,as to be expected :),4,,"We had a bit of a walk (not signposted enough) to the Flyer from the SMRT, it is a nice visual when arriving at the flyer, there is water fountains posted around, there is koi fish pond below.
The ride itself was smooth and enjoyable, would have liked to go at night, but later i saw that maybe the bright colourful lights might have interfered with taking pictures anyway...
nice gift shop, not all to expensive...

there is a lovely Subway at the bottom which my kids loved.",,,
,,Lovely way to see the City!,5,,We did this in the evening so that we could see all the lights. Also the Indonesian fires were making the days very smoky and hazy so it was not worth doing in the day. There was about a 20 minute wait but it was worth it. Had a great time and recommend doing this.,,,
,,Great Views of Singapore,4,,"Singapore Flyer is worth a visit with discount tickets available just outside the attraction so don't book online. The rotation takes around 30minutes and if you time it right around sunset you get to see the day/night view of Singspore.

I took friends visiting to the Flyer and thoughly enjoyed the experience and would go again. It is week worth a visit.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,"The first thing what we did in Singapore was being on flyer, so cool and adventure , we Could do Great photos of sin view馃槈 !!!",,,
,,flyer i can say its just coool!!!!!!!!!!!!,5,,"when I visited flyer it was rainy day and its was just looking soo cooool out there and and its was revoloving with the frequency of 10.0 sec and and honestly u can see 92.5% of Singapore from Singapore flyer
I will surely recommend this attraction thos who are going to Singapore

thank you",,,
,,The best Ferris wheel we have been on.,5,,"We have been on quite a few ""wheels"" around the world and this is the best. It is very clean and the ride which takes about 30 minutes gives a great view of Singapore.",,,
,,"""An Experience""",4,,"""Singapore Flyer"" ""An Experience worth Exploring"" ""Very Nice View of Singapore from the Top the Flyer""",,,
,,The best view of Singapore,5,,Singapore flyer is the best way to get the full view of the city..We were lucky to have a clear day without haze and the view from flyer was truly great. It takes 30 minutes to make a full circle and meanwhile you can get the best possible view of Singapore and even some part of Indonesia.We went in morning and and rush was less. It is surely a must try.,,,
,,"""Flying in the Air""",4,,"Never know Singapore can be so beautiful up there. As i told me son, we are flying up and enjoying the view like a bird. Great family treat! We came back for the night view too. It's a different kind of feeling.",,,
,,Great view.,5,,It was a lifelong experience for me. You can view all Singapore's from here. Also you can view some parts of Malaysia and Indonesia ftom here.,,,
,,Nice bird view but expensive,3,,Mistake of mine! to fly at 7 pm there're not dark yet T-T u should fly around 8 or 9 pm lately but nice and excited when u look through the clear glass in the container.,,,
,,Great views!,4,,A panoramic view of Singapore... It's a tad expensive but hey its a enjoyable journey especially something a family would enjoy,,,
,,"""Amazing view at Night""",5,,Wonderful experience at night. it takes 35-40 minutes in the ride and their staff did not fill the pods so you can walk in side and enjoy the view. would highly recommend doing this ride at night as the lights of Singapore are amazing.,,,
,,Excellent night view,4,,The location of Flyer in Marina Bay is ideal place to watch Singapore at night . It overlooks Marina Bay and gives birds eye view from top. A should see in Singapore.,,,
,,Amazing experience.,5,,This is a 'must do' activity when visiting Singapore. The views are simply amazing and you get to see the 360 degree view of the whole city. The Flyer travels very slowly giving you time to take it all in. The capsules are large and have the capacity to hold a large group of people if necessary. It's best not to go if heavy rain or fog or haze.,,,
,,Eye for the City tourist,5,,"A must for people who loved London eye or did not get a chance to visit any such flyers.
This half an hour feels awesome inside capsule and you can opt for drinks if you want. Find Marina and soccer field and click some pictures to stun friends :)",,,
,,Tourist must do.,5,,I would recommend going up in the Flyer at night. All the city lights are just gorgeous and it makes for great photos!,,,
,,Amazing,5,,The view is really beautiful in the night with light. The cubicles are really big and better to have a dinner in there if possible. the best time to go is around 6:30 because you can see the day light till the dark falls.,,,
,,A good view!,4,,Flyer is a good way to see a view of the city... if it is not hazy! Air conditioned pods. Ride takes about 30 minutes,,,
,,singapore flyer,3,,"its ok as I did it with my husband and it takes around 20 minutes for the ride and after you see it nothing more to do
with children will be nice.
no lines, if I would had to be in queue I will for sure not do it",,,
,,You can overlook the city....,4,,"View is spectacular in the night... I think one who visit in the day time can see the the city more clearer...But, u only see buildings and water...that's all....U can't see the other side of the city cause they are covered by the buildings...anyway, I think its a must visit....",,,
,,Second Best View in Singapore,5,,"This is a must when in Singapore, great views on a clear day but the view from Marina Sands probably better.",,,
,,Beautiful to do at night,5,,"Take photos when you are on the way down as opposed to going up. You will not get the reflection of the lights from the flyer. Buy the photo, great souvenir",,,
,,Very costly no attraction,3,,Wheel looks good. Clean and spacious cabin. But no proper view from cabin same or more attractive view from santosa merlion tower or marina bay sands. Ticket is 31$ for adults and 29$for kids. All tickts valid only 7days.,,,
,,hiflyer,5,,it's just the best for a view of the skyline and the gardens by the bay .we do it evert time we are in singapore,,,
,,I loved it.,4,,"Awesome view, great structure, amazing. You could really see the beauty of Singapore. I recommend this site to the tourists interested in seeing the beautiful sites in this country.",,,
,,"A City View .Should be in Top 5 itenary list , but costly",4,,This is a memorable ride. I was lucky to go on a weekday and ended up getting the entire cabin for my family of 3.Go when there is no haze to get you best photographs click,,,
,,Great - except for the Indonesian air pollution,3,,"Very quiet when we there due to the severe smoke pollution from Indonesian fires so we had no queueing and just another couple in our car. Views were less that great, but would have been so much better in a smoke free sky - so my rating underscores what, on a clear day, would have been quite spectacular.",,,
,,Shame about the haze (smog),3,,This is one of those trips that nowadays is hardly an adrenaline rush particularly as Flyers or Eyes are in most cities these days. But we enjoyed our half an hour or so which would have been better but for the haze that had engulfed the city. There could be some great photo opportunities on a clear day. Not the cheapest activity.,,,
,,Well managed view,4,,Great to get a nice view of the city and the historic entrance to Singapore. Well managed and not too long. A bit on the pricey side but great for the kids,,,
,,Fun and worth the price,5,,"We purchased the more expensive package which included a Singapore Sling cocktail. It seemed like a lot of money to pay (around double the ticket price) but when up you consider the price of drinks in Singapore it really wasn't too bad. Once we arrived and realised we were got to wait in the lounge then skip all queues before entering a different styled, much nicer feeling cab which was semi private (only sharing with one other couple) instead of the packed ones with a bench in the middle I definitely felt it was worth it.
Great views, good service, the haze did hamper our 'perfectly timed for sunset' trip but that was out of everyone's (well almost everyone) control.
It is slow turning and the 30 mins is the most you'd want to spend there, we sat outside the lounge/bar afterwards with a few more cocktails (very good I must say) and watched fireworks in the Gardens By The Bay. A very enjoyable start to a night in Singapore.",,,
,,A Must Ride During First Visit to Singapore....,5,,It is the tallest Flywheel/Flyer in the word. A cabin accommodates 12-14 persons. The speed is so slow that you do not realize that you are going up or down. You can move around the cabin to take photographs. View from the top is thrilling. View of Marina Bay Hotel from the top is excellent. You can view floating football ground from the top. The view of city on one side & view of sea on other makes you feel to stay there as long as possible. A must watch for the first time visitor to Singapore. Although ticket is costly but then everything is costly at Singapore ....,,,
,,Great experience,5,,We loved it !! especially the view of the Grand Prix curcuit and views of the city. The staff did not over fill the pods,,,
,,What a scenic biew,4,,"It takes about 35-40 minutes to complete this ride
Nice views of the various skylines
Make sure you find the soccer field in the water!!!!
Skyline is of course very new skyscrapers and not historical but
Very nice - enjoyable views of the waterfront and marina",,,
,,Flying visit,5,,We visited the Singapore Flyer as it was part of our 3-day stop ever package and we loved it. The view was incredible and we were able to see where we had been and where we were still planning to go - would certainly recommend it as a 'must do' on any trip to Singapore.,,,
,,Majestic Views,4,,This was a great experience where one can view all of Singapore's main attractions from above. The $33 entry fee is a bit steep but alas the ride is enjoyable! Definitely a must do when visiting Singapore for the first time.,,,
,,Glad I Did It.,4,,"The only thing holding this back from a 5 star rating would be the price but to be honest it wasn't that bad and I would say it was well worth it. A very well run attraction with friendly, helpful and not pushy staff. The view was INCREDIBLE! I went during the day after having been in Singapore for a few days, so it was exciting to have seen all the places we had been (although my husband wondered if it would have been been doing it first and then being able to see where we wanted to go). I would have gone back at night to see the city all lit up but both the price and time were factors.",,,
,,Breathtaking,4,,"Experience it.. one must. Breathtaking view of Singapore. If not for the haze, one can see land mass belonging to Malaysia and Indonesia. I was afraid of heights but the stability of the compartment relieved my fear.",,,
,,What a stunning view across Singapore,5,,"We visited Singapore Flyer around 7pm when it was getting dark.
Wow, it was amazing! The views across the city are breathtaking, not only because of the sheer height of this big wheel.
33 SGD per person is a big price but worth every penny!
As we havent experienced the daylight ride we can only say: NIGHT TIME is really really nice and you will certainly enjoy it.",,,
,,A great way to see the city,5,,"This is a really great way to see the city skyline and also the bay, its is like the London Eye but travels a lot slower se you have moore time to see and photograph the views. On the day we did the Flyer the city was covered with a haze due to fires in Indonesia, which did effect any photos taken. The rode is air condtioned and was clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. There were no queus on the day and some cars only had a few passengers. Certainly worth doing and is on the HOHO bus routes.",,,
,,Amazing view,5,,This experience was just wow...the view from the flyer is superbb... and u cannot feel the movement of the flyer at all!..it is made of very thick glass and is air conditioned... ull have lot of time to take pics and enjoy the scenic view with comfort...over all enjoyed the experience!!,,,
,,The Flyer,5,,"You can kill two birds with one stone with this visit as the flyer is located next to the F1 track which you are allowed to walk on and get photos for free !!
A good overview of the harbour and city district can be seen a nice relaxing 45 minute trip then a cold drink or ice cream before a trip up the Singapore River on a Bum boat back to the hotel makes for a nice day out.",,,
,,Expensive but fantastic view,5,,"I do understand why people complain about the price but I do not understand why people say that the view is not worth it!
There is no better view on the skyline and on the rest of Singapore than from there and the low speed allows you to enjoy the view and to take good pictures.
I can highly recommend it in the evening...",,,
,,Birthday party in the flyer,3,,"We had been here for a birthday party celebration. Quite a novel concept I would say. However, I never found the flyer so interesting since it moves so slowly so it's equivalent to seeing the SG sights from a tall building.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"An excellent experience in the sky. You get to see not just the waterfront , but the Singapore Shipyard and the city area.

The ride is slow enough for tourists to take in the view from every angle. The Marina Sands hotel is also visible from the Flyer as is Faber Hill.
In all, a worthwhile ride to add to a holiday itinerary as tourists can see lots of Singapore's landmarks. Lots of time to take pictures.
The ride is very smooth and the attendants are very helpful and attentive to safety.",,,
,,Great experience,5,,"Wow! That was fantastic, what a wonderful way to see Singapore, LQQKING in every direction, enjoyed every second of this ride",,,
,,Call it a 360 Singapore Flyer,5,,Gives a great view of all places around it. Its slow and ideal for getting a look out of Singapore as a whole..,,,
,,Magnificent view on downtown Singapore and beyond,4,,"This ""wheel"" has been erected recently and gives its visitors a magnificent view over the city and far beyond. When the weather is good, one even can see Changi-airport ! Best time to visit is in the morning, as the sun shines from the east on the tall buildings. In the afternoon, the town is between the sun and the Flyer, which makes picture taking rather difficult. One turn takes about 37 minutes.",,,
,,It's just a big wheel!,3,,"This is a typical big wheel and very similar to what you will find in most major cities, was disappointed with the view due to fog or mist, wonder if it is ever clear in Singapore, doesn't really work unless you can see all around",,,
,,Amazing,5,,"What can i say? Amazing view, amazing staff, amazing garden, amazing flyer!! We had our photograph before we enter the flyer.",,,
,,Beautiful at Night!,4,,"We decided to go at night and were delighted in the views of all the lights of the city,
We were fortunate that our ""capsule"" only had 7 people so we could all see and take photos without getting into each other's way. If you time it right, try and be up on the Flyer by 8pm or 9:30pm you may see a water show from above!
It is only 4 star because the cost of $33.00 Singapore may be too high...otherwise, it was a good adventure!",,,
,,Great View,5,,"You can see a great view of the city. Should visit during 6-7pm, so that one can get a good day view as well as a night view of the city. Accessible for everyone including elders and children.",,,
,,Centre of Singaporean tourism industry,3,,"The attraction:
The tallest ferris wheel in Asia used to be the tallest in the world. The cabins are large, wide, stable and clean and with a clear view of the Garden by the Bay, CBD, promenade and Merlion for about 30 minutes. Souvenirs are available after the ride but are generally expensive -- buy them in Chinatown!

Food:
The Chinese (mainly Fukien) and Malaysian food court under the wheel provides good Bak Kut Teh and oyster omelettes.

Other attractions:
The Singapore Flyer is also the starting point of a number of local tours and bus services towards Malaysia. Try the DUKW tour which gives you an 'amphibious' experience of Singapore's busiest area.",,,
,,Dance like noone is watching,5,,We booked a Moet champagne flight and loved it. The flyer is so quiet and smooth and as someone who hates heights I was so thrilled to realise it was no problem on this experience. There is something quite magical when your private capsule arrives and you enter to be greeted with champagne and chocolates and sent on your way. A beautiful way to see Singapores night time skyline.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,I was eagerly looking forward for the Singapore Flyer right from the day I landed in the location. However I could make it on my second day of my stay. The best thing that I liked in it was the smooth functioning and the variety of the capsules that we had in the flyer. Even though there was a lot of haze that obstructed a long visibility we still could enjoy the ride.,,,
,,Good view,3,,In spite of the haze we were able to view most of Singapore's landmarks. Quite similar to London eye.,,,
,,Too slow for my liking,3,,I have been to flyer couple of times. I found this too slow and little boring. A good alternative can be Marina bay Sand's skypark. It would give us more flexibility.,,,
,,Nice view!,4,,Great way to get an awesome view of the city. The wheel spins slowly so you get plenty of time to take pictures and enjoy the view. Theres also a lot of foodstand if you get hungry.,,,
,,Good view of the city,4,,"If you have not been on a flyer before, then try this one. Quite similar to the London flyer except with different views.",,,
,,The view,5,,"It's quite expensive but it's worth it. We can see Singapore. Better start at 7pm, when the sun ready to set. We can see the change from day to night.",,,
,,High Wheel deck,5,,We got one deck exclusively for us and we had a nice time in the Singapore Flyer. It takes around 30 minutes to cover one cycle round. You get to see most of Singapore tourist spots from here since it is close to Sentosa and marina bay,,,
,,Great panaromic views,2,,"Great panaromic views, though it does get mundane after a while. The price is a bit high too. It was a great experience, but needs no repetition.",,,
,,Nice ride but the view - a bit sad,4,,"I strongly advise you from not taking this ride during the haze over Singapore. I went here on a hazy six-hour stopover and it was a bit of a disappointment - not the ride, but the view. Go here when the skies are blue and it's a clear day as the views will be spectacular. My views were covered by haze and all I could see was this grey covering of a sad state of affairs in one of the neighbouring countries. Definitely brings one's spirit down.",,,
,,Great View,4,,"We went on the Flyer last week while in Singapore and really enjoyed it. We got there early so as to avoid the crowds and were second in line when it opened. As it turned out, there were no crowds that morning so we shared one of the ""pods"" with only one other couple. It was great to be able to move around and take pictures from all sides. The views of Singapore are the best from a high elevation and this provided the best vantage point to see the city. Highly recommend a trip on the flyer to anyone visiting Singapore.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,A good 30 minute breath taking view of the city. At the foot of the flyer there's a small little garden and a good eatery,,,
,,Expensive way to kill 20 minutes,3,,"Eminently skippable. I did enjoy seeing the Gardens by the Bay from 500 feet, but there are probably better views to be had. Might want to do it just for the air conditioning, though.",,,
,,A way to see Singapore,4,,"Timed our ride so that we got to the top just as the sun was starting to set, so that is the only thing that made it worth the price in my book. I was happy to get the half price ticket available for students. While it doesn't have the best views of Singapore, it does offer pretty darn good views 360 degrees, so it does make a good photo op. The 30 minute trip felt about 20 minutes too long, though, especially with a handful of small children running around and complaining. I was afraid of stepping on a child every time I turned around.

There are some cool things that happen sometimes in the special modules, I'm not sure how much they cost though - I'd imagine they are pricy. The museum type are you walk through before getting onto the flyer is neat. I enjoyed reading about its construction, but I'm pretty nerdy about that type of stuff. I spent half the ride looking towards the center of the wheel admiring the mechanics of the attraction.

It definitely is a one time attraction however, not something I would do again.",,,
,,"Excellent, but costly",5,,"The entire experience was wonderful. The staff are friendly. The structure is very well maintained notably with crystal clear windows.

The only negative is the high price.

We went at night and the view really is wonderful. I can't comment on day time view but I'd expect it to be good.",,,
,,Gives you a nice feel for the whole city,4,,This was a fun picture spot that gives you a good feel for the downtown and port area. It is a short walk from the subway stop.,,,
,,Amazing view,5,,It is one of the most visit attraction in Singapore. You should visit the place at 6:30 to 7:30 PM. You can see bothlight view and Natural city view. It is better to buy ticket in China in China market for half the price.,,,
,,Similar to London Eye,3,,Moves slowly. Great location. If u have done it once at some other location can skip it. Otherwise a good bet.,,,
,,Top view,4,,"Went with family. Awesome time. Would recommend it, but comes with a price. Good for children Can see various places",,,
,,Good views,4,,"Good views,specially at night,but crowded, really worth views over the bay and the modern buildings, as well as over the gardens",,,
,,Must watch,5,,Technical marvel with a beautiful view of singapore and offers good price if u are travelling with kids,,,
,,OK view,2,,The Singaproe Flyer is an OK way to have a look over the central business district of Singapore. I think it is about an hour ride like all the big ferris wheels sprouting over all the big cities in the world. Personally I think you get a better view going to the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel and have a drink at the bar or dinner there. Of course the drinks/dinnner are expensive there but then you are not paying a fee to go on a ride.,,,
,,Just magnificent,5,,i hate heights but my wife talked me into stepping into this attraction. We only had to wait 20 minutes and the structure looked so sturdy that for this time i loved height. great views!,,,
,,See Singapore from top,5,,"Singapore Flyer is a very good spot to check out the Marina era from the top. I think it's better to get on by night. It was not scary at all, for those who are afraid of heights. I myself am afraid of heights but I could only see beauty during my flight on the flyer. You should try!",,,
,,Nice views but a little pricey,3,,"If you are staying at the Marina Bay Sands, a ride on the Singapore Flyer becomes superfluous, as you get the same views from the 57th floor Sky Deck.",,,
,,The world's highest observation wheel,4,,This flyer was constructed to bring prosperity to Singapore. It has 28 huge passenger capsules that can each carry up to 28 people.,,,
,,disappointing. melbourne one is better,3,,"was very disappointed. you do get the views of the marina bay. but you had to share the carriage with other people. no commentary. very basic. go to the melbourne one. i had the entire carriage myself plus map and commentary there. not worth it. go to ion sky. you get the views, free and no time limit",,,
,,Try clear day / dusk.,4,,"This is a really nice 'distraction' to do when in the area. Works very well with exploring the Gardens, Marina Bay, Helix Bridge. I was suprised that there was no long line when we came, we could pretty much board when we wanted. The views over the skyline are great. The views out to sea were rather murky, thanks to the Haze.",,,
,,A fantastic view of Singapore,5,,I went for a ride just after the sun was set and it gave a fantastic view over Singapore. The daylight is disappearing and all the lights from all over the city makes a superb picture. If you a very scared of heights maybe you should stay away.,,,
,,A beautiful view from above...,5,,It was a thrilling experience to go around in the Singapore Flyer and it was indeed a great view and experience Singapore .. Don't miss it,,,
,,Amazing night view,5,,Wonderful experience at night. Only issue we had was the smoke haze that reduced visibility!! Enjoyed the flight!!,,,
,,We were lucky,5,,Singapore is having awful problems with haze from forest fires in Indonesia and we were lucky that when we went up it was not too bad. Amazing views of the city and F1 staring grid. Went on a city tour on the way home 10 days later and the haze was appalling and the views would have been poor.,,,
,,Really nice to be there,5,,Well.. We did the flyer at night and it was really nice to see all the city being light up. Travelling to flyer is also very easy as it is situated near this Promnade MRT Station. And there were some nice restaurants in the premise but make sure you go there bit early. It was around 9.30 pm when we completed our ride but by that time most food stalls were closing. Good place to be at night in Singapore.,,,
,,Singapore Eye,5,,Best time to visit to Singapore Flyer is in the evening. 5 - 7pm is perfect to see the beauty of Singapore city.,,,
,,Awesome views of Singapore,5,,"On your next visit do yourself a favour and go on the Singapore Flyer for the most awesome views of this amazing city. It is best done by night so you can appreciate the city lights. And while you are up there, you can see Malasya and Indonesia too.",,,
,,Whole Singapore can be viewed from here.,4,,The Singapore flyer is really awesome for the view of the whole city. Its really nice and friendly for person in wheel chairs too.. it moves one circle in 30 minutes giving a good view of Singapore.,,,
,,Brilliant at night,5,,"I am not a fan of big cities however during a stop over in Singapore my husband and I gave the flyer a go.

It was really good to see all the city lights from far away and was a comfortable pod to stand or sit in to watch all around and take photos.

Well worth a visit to see Singapore from a different perspective, especially at night when you can see all the lights from the buildings around the bay.",,,
,,Poor Service!,1,,"2nd time on the flyer. Both times had staff displaying undesirable service standards and utter lack of respect. More so at the 2nd level entrance.
Would definitely consider other options when entertaining overseas clients!",,,
,,our last night,4,,"we did the flyer the day before we flew home so it was lovely to look back and see all the places that we had been. going at night also meant the haze that was there during the day wasn't as much of an issue, kids loved it and it was definitely a worthwhile experience.",,,
,,My experience,5,,"I have taken this flyer during the visit to singapore , this was designed to accommodate all the age groups so u need not fear yo take this as it goes very slowly , it typically takes 40 minutes to complete one full circle , u get a 360 view of harbour station , football stadium , garden by bay and other places from this flyer. I have paid 30 $ per person to take this which is totally worth it . After getting down from flyer and before leaving the place make sure u visit the small man made fountain situated just under that which is awesome.",,,
,,GOOD EXPERINCE,4,,"I am afraid of heights, but in this giant wheel, I was afraid before, but when I was on ride, didn't feel any fear. It is very safe. Even with small kids also its safe.",,,
,,Worth to try!,4,,Very beautiful view from the top of the flyer should try when u are here just the tickets a little bit expensive the rest you can enjoy the city view but best at night time.,,,
,,New experience,5,,Actually I afraid of height but my sis and her friend wanna rode on the flyer. So we go there together. I think it very safe when I'm in the capsule. It's a great way to getting great view over Singapore and enjoy to take a photo.,,,
,,Overpriced,2,,"It's nice to see from distance, but the ride it's slow and boring, not to mention overpriced. Deck at the Marina Bay Sands it's alot better.",,,
,,Skip this,2,,"This ride is ultimately boring and way more expensive than marina bay sands observation deck. Adult ticket will cost you 33sgd. Skip these and try to go to Marina Bay Sands Rooftop Bar instead and buy yourself a drink while enjoying the same skyline view.

Cons:They wont allow us to have a separate capsule from the other tourist considering that there are no heavy line wait.",,,
,,Nothing to Fear!,5,,"We, my wife and I, are afraid of fast moving giant Wheel. So, where ever we see one, we avoid riding it. But, this was different. We rode this flyer in the evening. It is so huge, that one cannot imagine it unless one goes there. We were 22 people in one box. It moved so slow that we could not feel that we were moving. It gave a complete evening view of Singapore. People say that you can see Indonesia and Malaysia from here. We did see the lights at far off distance which our son-in-law told us was Malaysia. Time passes. You feel that you have just entered your box when it is time to get down.",,,
,,Good ride,4,,"I had the ride on the flyer around lunch time. It was a hot and humid day, but the air conditioning worked perfectly well inside the capsule. Quite a nice ride.",,,
,,looking for a view over Singapore,5,,"This attraction was great, a little bit dare devil (but very safe ),
It says it one of the highest of its type in the world. Enclosed (like the London eye) its a very safe enclosed air conditioned way of getting great views over Singapore. It was from here that we identified the grand prix track and were able to walk some it later. This wheel looks out over the whole city. I understand that in the day you can see Indonesia from it.",,,
,,Must try,5,,"Your stay is not complete if you weren't able to try the singapore flyer. As I was informed, the flyer has 28 cabin/car(i don't know how they call it actually) and the whole rotation takes 28 minutes. You'll have a great view of the marina bay area. Don't forget to bring you with your camera.",,,
,,Overrated place,3,,nothing much to see here.. best to come in the evening so the night view is more worth the amount paid for the tickets,,,
,,Views.,5,,"well getting on was easy, and we enjoyed the 25minute circuit. Sadly due to fires in indonesia, the views were reduced, but still it was enjoyable. the glass pods would give excellent vision across the bay. We could see down into the botanical gardens",,,
,,Amazing Views of Singapore!,5,,"We rode the flyer in the evening with the amazing Singapore skyscrapers lights! Great experience! Every dollar spend on this ride is worth it. The capsule is very spacious, we enjoy the ride even though a family join us inside. You will surely enjoy the magnificent 360 degree view of Singapore. :D

The whole ride takes about 30 minutes. It is not enough!! ;)

The photo package is so EXPENSIVE! 25$ for a single photo! But we can't resist.. :(",,,
,,it is fantastic,5,,i went at the night.it is fantastic and so beautiful and so high. maybe at the day time is better view.,,,
,,Flyer and F1Grand Prix Track,4,,"Like the London Eye you get a good view of the city, providing it isn't too hazy. Note the 'boat building'. Below is the F1Grand Prix track and access is from the gardens under the Flyer. You can walk the track for free.",,,
,,Conquer your fears!,4,,I have a fear of heights and so it was with trepidation I agreed to accompany my daughter on the Flyer. It was a great experience as we had a cab to ourselves and could move around to take advantage of the wonderful views over the city and out over the water. The Flyer moves so slowly and evenly that you are hardly aware of movement and there is plenty of time to take in everything.,,,
,,Amazing views of Singapore,5,,We visited flier in the evening as this is one of the best attraction for tourists. Nice views of the Singapore.,,,
,,Fantastic View of the CIty,4,,"You got to enjoy and observed the beauty of Singapore. You will have the chance to have a look at Marina Bay's famous infinity pool, appreciate the architecture of the Gardens By the Bay. Before going up you may wanna buy something to eat while waiting for you to go down. It gets boring though because it moves so slowly. You just have to enjoy the whole view of the city.",,,
,,Nice view,4,,"Great view...especially at the end of the day when lights come out. Can be a bit crowded, but that is generally the case with this type of tourist attractions",,,
,,not all that interesting,3,,The only thing good is that you can take some breath taking amazing photos. Since the flyer moves very slowly it gets a little boring and if you are eager to see the beauty of Singapore city then you could as well go to Marina Bay sands or any other sky scrapers and admire the beauty.,,,
,,Amazing,4,,Would have been fantastic if it wasn't for the haze ruining the view which you know should be there. Still a great experience in an amazing structure,,,
,,Famous London eye in singapore,4,,"This is must visit sightseeing spot for those,who have not visited the famous London Eye of United Kingdom ! A big ferry wheel takes a 30 mins ride to complete a cycle ! Tickets are also as low as SGD 25 per person",,,
,,Amazing View,5,,"Took a ride on Singapore Flyer which was a great experience. Would highly recommend doing the ride at night as the lights of Singapore are amazing. Could see the light show on the harbour, cityscape lights, Marina Bay Gardens etc. Very pretty.
Reasonably priced for the 30 minute ride. It is also possible to book a dinner in one of the gondolas which would also be a unique experience.",,,
,,What a view,5,,Only recently went on the Singapore Flyer over the GP weekend and what a view. Although hazy you could see most of the track as well as great views of the Marina Bay Sands and surrounds.,,,
,,Great experience,5,,Although i am afraid of heights this experience was amazing to do. Its very safe and you walk through a museum of how they made the Singapore Flyer so it makes you feel very comfortable. The staff were great as well very friendly.,,,
,,views views views,5,,What's not to love from a Ferris wheel?! A must if you don't have much time in Singapore. Can be a bit awkward to get to if you walk from certain areas.,,,
,,Nice views,4,,Took one ride of 30mins just to see the city. Views are amazing and they have tried their best to make this a special place. At the end of the day it is just a wheel that gives you nice views over the city for 30 mins.,,,
,,Great Views,5,,Loved the Singapore Flyer - we went first thing in the morning and it was very quiet so had a pod to ourselves. The views were fantastic though a little hazy. It takes about an hour to go round.,,,
,,great lookout,5,,"We had a round on the wheel during the night. a little expensive, but definetly worth of. Great view of the neighborhood expecially the botanic gardens; I would recommend a ride at sundown/twilight. Easy to be reached, within walking distance from bus stops nearby. Recommended",,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"A great experience, regardless of the haze. Admired the views and marvelled at the engineering. Fantastic!!",,,
,,Spectacular views of Singapore Skyline!,4,,"We visited the Flyer in October '15 during daytime. Got a very good view of Singapore skyline, although it was hazy which ruined the experience to some extent. I would recommend visiting it by night, as the whole of Singapore lights up at night.",,,
,,Great view of the City Lights! Right above part of the Formula 1 Race Track.,4,,"Its really good to get a view of the city. Not the best to take pics with a flash though, due to the perspex, you do get reflections so you dont get the best quality pics at night. Saying that, it is still something that you should do if not only to get an idea of were everything is. Its on a constant rotation so when you are getting on and off it is still moving all be it really slowly, so just watch you step. It says that it's open until 10pm and once you've gone for a spin on the wheel there are other places on the lower levels that you can visit.",,,
,,better first thing in the morning before tours arrive,5,,"lovely experience, well equipped for wheelchair users, felt 'special' as had a pod to ourselves, lovely helpful staff",,,
,,What a View of Singapore,5,,"It is one of the most attractions of Singapore for tourists, the view from the top of flyer is breath-taking. Day or night....amazing.",,,
,,I Conquered my fear,4,,"I never rode a ferris wheel before. I just don't like it on how I see it. but this one is a must try! why would I be afraid when up there I can see the beautiful Singapore at night. I really choose night because of the lights of the buildings. but they said that in the morning it is even better because you can see even the nearby countries, like Indonesia and Malaysia. But still I enjoyed my 30 minutes there, you will never feel notice that you are moving, even if you jump inside. Great experience",,,
,,You can even book a party in the capsules,4,,"10 minutes on a flight is enough to satisfy you, but when you know it's 30 minutes, you start wondering why you didn't book the champagne flight or dinner flight! The museum area surrounding the Flyer is interesting for the little ones.",,,
,,For a different view of Singapore,4,,While waiting for our bus we decided to do a circuit on the flyer. Great view of the gardens. Smog/smoke reduced view.,,,
,,Good spot to see the F1 track at night.,4,,"We went up to get a good view of the F1 track after the first night practice. It was a pretty awesome view of the street circuit all lit up at night. The windows of our car were pretty dirty, though. It was quite a challenge to get pictures without a lot of reflections in the glass, but it can be done if you are patient. The cars are quite roomy, and you are free to move around inside.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,"The experience is very nice. You can view almost half of singapore from top.

They say even the tip of Indonesia is visible from a distance.

For photo enthusiasts it is must go ride.

The flyer wheel goes very slowly that you do not feel the height fobia.

29 capsules with each capsule can take 29 persons. It seems 29 is a lucky number for Singaporeans.",,,
,,yo see the best view of Singapore,4,,It an amazing glass carriage to see the best view of Singapore city. you would be lucky to see the best super vision in a clear day. Highly recommend to feel this awesome experience for all travelers visiting in SG.,,,
,,Lovely way to see Singapore,5,,"My wife and I spent a few nights in Singapore for our honeymoon and we couldn't leave Singapore without experiencing the Singapore Flyer. It is such a beautiful way to see Singapore and make sure to take our advice and do the flyer at night! Singapore by night is beautiful as you see the whole skyline lit up with such beautiful lights! Very romantic also especially if you want to impress!

Another handy tip, if you flew Singapore Airlines make sure to bring your boarding pass as you will get a 10% discount of admission prices. My wife and I didn't know this until we bought our admission tickets!",,,
,,Spectacular,5,,"The flyer is a must. I have tried all the big wheels and this is probably the best. It was easy to board and not that busy. The views are amazing but there is a risk of haze during the day. Need to try the wheel at both day and night, as Singapore at night is beautiful, especially downtown and gardens by the bay.",,,
,,View Singapore,4,,"Beautiful views of the city, the port and out to sea. I went in the daytime, and I imagine it is a different view again at sunset. However, the price at around 20 euros is a bit prohibitive for 2 trips!",,,
,,Views,5,,"Enjoyed this experience, smoke spoilt the views but on a clear day this would be magnificent. Suggest checking weather conditions first. Be prepared for a walk if you catch the MRT.",,,
,,Nice view,4,,- nice view on the marina bay and F1 homestrech - ride takes 30 min - recomend to go during sunset or at night,,,
,,Awesome when there is a view,4,,A great attraction sadly the haze from the Indonesian fires limits the view to a few kms. If the haze is minimal its worth a visit.,,,
,,Great view,4,,I am not a lover of heights and found this trip a bit off putting. However the view is fantastic and it gives you a great sight of the layout of Singapore. The day we went it was spoilt by the haze from the fires in Indonesia. It is not cheap and I think a better option is the view from the Marina Bay hotel on the 57 floor. It is better value to have lunch at the top or even a drink at the restaurant and then enjoy the view.,,,
,,Night View of Singapore,5,,Best time to go after 7.30pm . Best view of Singapore in Lights Also they is more enjoyment to kids .,,,
,,Gr8 trip,4,,"Once a lifetime visit, 1 hour on the wheels. Expensive, but worth it..carry your passports or national identity cards...",,,
,,"Wonderful views of the City Skyline and the Sea, super well organized",4,,"Very nice plan to get a super good flavor of the Wonders of Singapore, from the Central Business District, Gardens by the Bay, the Stadium and the sea. Day or night are great, the cabins are air conditioned, and it is plenty of services in the base (restaurants and others). Very nice for couples or families. BRING YOUR CAMERA...",,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,Worth every penny. Fantastic views. Not crammed in. A must do in Singapore. Call in from the Hop on Hop off bus.,,,
,,The LARGEST Flyer on the Globe,5,,"With the continuity of rotation and Fine Dining on the Flyer, this place gonna create a memorable experience.",,,
,,The Flyer,3,,"Went for a spin on the Flyer. It was a nice view and the experience was nice. I think that it is a little overpriced but is nice to do once. It would be nice if there were more of the construction details explained, the many challenges that had to be overcome in order to make this available.",,,
,,Beautiful city,5,,"My children and i really enjoyed our morning on the Singapore Flyer.

It is located on the eastern side of the cbd and close to many hotels. A taxi fare from Little India to the Flyer costs $10 SGD.

The Singapore Flyer offers spectacular views of the city. Unfortunately we weren't blessed with a clear day as the haze from Sumatra is still ongoing. But, on the upside, what we witnessed was quite beautiful.

The ride takes approx. 30 mins and costs $78 SGD for a family ticket. There is a great little gift shop and photo shop available after the trip.",,,
,,Great views .,5,,We won tickets for the Flyer but we would have tried it anyway. As we were in Singapore for the Grand Prix the flyer could not have been better. Situated in the centre of the circuit it gave us a birds eye view and gave perspective to the rest of the City. Well worth a visit.,,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,"Great experience, the wheel goes very slowly and you get great views of the city. A must do whilst in Singapore",,,
,,Best during sunset,5,,"Try to take the ride during sunset.Because Singapore looks beautiful during night as well as in day.It gives great view of the city and sea.But rates are pretty high for the ride,it lasts for around half an hour.",,,
,,A little overpriced but amazing views...,4,,"It's a little overpriced but do give it a try as you do get an amazing view of Singapore city. Huge flyer and the ride takes about 30-45 mins including of queue time. Nice ride and place to take pictures. After the ride, take the exit nearer to the river and take more pictures :)",,,
,,Awesome!,5,,My wife and I did the dining package for our wedding anniversary. It was a 4 course meal (2 rotations of the wheel). We had the whole carriage to ourselves that night and it was awesome. It was an anniversary we will not forget.,,,
,,Third time lucky,5,,We've tried to go on the Flyer on two previous Singapore visits and been foiled by thunderstorms. This time the weather gods were on our side and we enjoyed spectacular views of Singapore as daylight dissolved into twilight. Very enjoyable for all.,,,
,,FERRIS WHEEL FUN,5,,"Great fun to see the city and all its sights ,thats if you don't want to go to the Sands Hotel for a drink
Well organised ,clean a little pricey ,but everything is in Singapore
Just like the 'eye' in London
Nice and relaxing once you are in your bubble
From here you could go to the nearby gardens and the to the Sands Hotel Bar for a cocktail",,,
,,Birds Eye,4,,Similar to the London Eye but not as grand. The flyer gives you a great view of Singapore . Located near the Marina Bay area and within walking distance to the other landmarks,,,
,,Wonderful view of Singapore,4,,This observation wheel gives a great view of Singapore. Total ride last 30 mins. We went in the morning when it is less crowded.,,,
,,Fly in air of Singapore,5,,360* View from top of the Wheel. Excited ride.. Have Benches to seat in coach. Nice experience.. Full view of Garden by the bay and race cource with Singapore Stadium.. Malion..,,,
,,Lovely,5,,"Its truly is a world class flyer very spacious , huge & shows you different colors of Singapore at the same time. Its a memory one cant forget. must see in Singapore.",,,
,,What a lovely view !!!,5,,"Me & my wife went on Singapore flyer and it was amazing view from the Flyer of the whole Singapore !

We went in the afternoon time and were able to clearly observe and enjoy all the attractions clearly.

We also got our photos as a souvenier in night flyer as in night it looks mind blowing but we didn't have time to go at night.",,,
,,Must see at night,5,,The staff were great and cater for the disabled. they even stopped the wheel so my friend could board safely.,,,
,,Worth doing on a clear day,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is definitely worth a vist just for the panoramic views. That said, I felt the price was pretty steep for the 30 minute experience.

Also, be sure to pick a clear day as the haze we experienced spoilt the experience slightly by obscuring the views that were potentially on offer",,,
,,singapore on a wheel,4,,"a good 30 minute ride.. give u a 360 degree panaromic view of singapore.. u can see appartments, botanical garden, marina bay hotel, F1 track... merlion.. all in just one ride..",,,
,,Biggest of its kind in the world.,4,,THis is the biggest of its kind in the world apparently. Gives you some great views views of Singapore right to the suburbs and beyond.,,,
,,Great views of Singapore,3,,The ride takes approximately half an hour and although it is expensive ($33 per adult) it is worth doing once :),,,
,,"A great ride that I could hardly ""feel""! :)",5,,"I was totally impressed by it since I hadn't known what to expect never having been on a ""ferris wheel"" of that size before! :) But it was an ABSOLUTELY stable, comfortable experience without feeling any shaking of the cabin or anything; in fact, I didn't feel any movement of the cabin at all, the only way I could tell it was moving was from the changes in views outside; and yes, unfolded before my eyes as the cabin went round were such spectacular views as those of Gardens by the Bay, the Marina Bay Sands hotel with its 'boat deck' (SkyPark) on top, the super tall buildings of the central financial district and 'the Durian' and panoramic views of the Marina Bay encompassing all or most of those ""landmarks"" at pretty much any given time. Each cabin can fit in like ten people ""really comfortably"" (maybe even up to 20), and the ride lasts about half an hour.

In the same building where you go on the Flyer are also some other things to do like a little tropical garden (free of charge), a 4-or-5-dimensional movie theater, a fish-therapy-for-feet shop and a flight simulator place if you feel like spending extra money on top of that for the Flyer which itself is not cheap but is totally worth doing as mentioned above (I just mean the Flyer since I didn't do anything else in the building except the little tropical garden which is free).

The best way to get here by public transportation is taking the MRT to Promenade station (blue & yellow lines), and the building of the Flyer is just about a 5-minute walk once outside (you'll see the Flyer once you've come out of the station onto the road above).

An important thing to keep in mind when planning for this one is it may shut down on a short notice on rainy days. I was lucky when I did it because they announced a cancellation shortly after my ride was finished with the rain starting to come down.",,,
,,Great way to see the city of singapore,5,,"A very slow moving ride giving plenty of time to soak in the surrounds of Singapore at a great height, making for splendid photos.",,,
,,Great way to see the sights,5,,Wow a great experience. Except for the smoke. Great sweeping view. A smooth wonderful way to have an overview . Wee bit pricey. But worth the experience,,,
,,It's a Must in Singapore,4,,"You don't always get the chance to ride on the tallest attraction of it's kind in the world.
I was doubting if it was worth it, I'm glad that I did it.
The view is great, Day or Night is just great. If you go there early you can avoid the long lines to get in. Actually I had the whole cart for me alone.",,,
,,A Great View of Singapore,4,,The Singapore Flyer is a giant Ferris wheel in Singapore works as an observation wheel. It has 28 air-conditioned capsules. We were pleased to observe Singapore from this Flyer at an overall height of 165 metres. We have been in this one of world's tallest Ferris wheel. Do visit and enjoy.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,The view from the top is awesome. We did it at night where we saw the lights at Gardens by the Bay and the Laser showm Next time we'll do it during the day to see more of Singapore's icons and maybe neighbouring countries.,,,
,,Fabulous,5,,"The Singapore flyer was a terrific experience. Love it, the views were amazing. Did not have to wait long. Would recommend to everyone visiting Singapore.",,,
,,good to see,4,,"Another great place to visit ,the Singapore flyer ,great views all over.It takes about 30 min to rotate.There were only five people in our pod so could move around easily to admire the views.",,,
,,Worth doing once.,4,,Its certainly worth doing once as part of the Singapore experience. Great view by day or night and evening champagne options are available for those who wish to get all romantic.,,,
,,It was just okay,3,,"I spent a long while in Singapore early this year and have enjoyed it tremendously. On a random day my friend and I walked all the way from Clarke Quay going to the Singapore Flyer to try and see a great view of the city.

The wait to take your turn on the trip was interesting enough with the interactive visuals and displays. The place was well kept and the lines were organized. Compared to other touristy attractions in many countries, I find Singapore to have the most comfortable waiting lines and most efficient logistics when it comes to places with high volume and traffic. Upon boarding the flyer though, I was a bit underwhelmed. Although the views are quite spectacular, I find it quite expensive and would rather use the amount I spent on the flyer for somewhat the same view atop one of the sky bars available in the city. You have very limited time to enjoy the sights and most often than not, people will be blocking the nice views in an attempt to take good pictures.

If you're a first timer with some cash to spend and who don't mind heights, you might find this enjoyable. I suggest though to take it at night. If you're a traveler who would like to spend their cash wisely and wouldn't mind to find other alternatives, I suggest going to sky lounges or view decks around the city.",,,
,,A lovely way to end the day,5,,"The round trip on the flyer takes about half an hour, in that time you get to see fantastic views across the city and, as long as it is a clear day, you can see for miles. We went towards the end of the day so the pods weren't so full, so it was easy to walk around and take pictures without feeling like you were getting in the way of anyone else. It's a lovely way to end a day and there is also a great little food court underneath the flyer if you want to grab food or a sugar cane juice after.",,,
,,Fabulous view,5,,"We got onto the flyer by using our SIA stopover cards, which meant we didn't have to actually pay. Neither my husband nor I had been on one of these wonderful wheels, and it was awe inspiring being able to see so far in different directions. Unfortunately there was a bit of smoky haze which locals told it was from Indonesia burning forests. However it was not that bad that we were unable to enjoy the view",,,
,,You should give it a try once,3,,"a good 60min round of the city go at night to view the city lights, i went around evening but my round finished before the night start and i coudnt get good pictures also during my visit lot of construction around in that area, but its a good one time experience to get a different view of the city from different levels of height.",,,
,,Great view from the Singapore flyer,5,,"Great view! Worth to see ! Different angel of the beautiful Singapore night view ! The ticket is a but expensive, but as a tourist it's fine to see everything:)",,,
,,Spectacular,5,,"We visited late afternoon during the 2015 F1 Grand Prix and loved this trip. As we had entered GP on opening we were one of few people on attraction and had car to ourselves as we took in views of Marina Bay and Singapore.
Early races were also going on below as well which gave us a unique view of the racing.
Lovely experience, great views and spectacular photos taken for our memories.
A must do in our opinion.",,,
,,SINGAPORE FLYER,4,,"This is the second flyer I have been first one in London, In london it is beside the River Thames, while in london beside the singapore river or backwater etc., In london it always drizzles, in the singapore it turned Haze due to the burning of Indonesia forest. However the scene was excellent",,,
,,Fantastic views of city,5,,"A must do thing for all Singapore travelers. This place similar to the famous London Eye, great places. A capsule cabin takes a full circle in around 35 minutes which will give you the view of whole Singapore city. So amazing place of my country.",,,
,,Nice View of the City,4,,"It is a nice attraction in Singapore. The views of the city and surrounds are spectacular. 30 minute ride costs S$33, however if you have Singapore airlines boarding pass you can save 20%.",,,
,,Superb view,4,,"Superb view over the city and harbor. Try to go around sunset, so you can see it all by day light and light up.",,,
,,fantastic view for Singapore,4,,"It is exactly like "" London Eye "", but - sorry to say -, you can get the same view from most of the ""high"" hotels in Singapore. So if this is your 1st experience in any "" Flyer "", go for it, if not, go for the top floors of any hotels, or ION mall....it is the same.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,Great attraction with fantastic views. A must visit for all the family. Don't forget to take the camera.,,,
,,Excellent tourist attraction,5,,"Excellent concept, well laid out interior and exterior and attractive enough to want to wait for your trip. Courteous and helpful staff as well.",,,
,,What a veiw,5,,"We didn't realise just how huge the Flyer is until you are actually on board, the views of the city and surrounds are spectacular, a little bit stomach churning as you reach the top, but, worth every minute, do it again in a flash",,,
,,Specta city view.,4,,Spectacular view of the city. 30 minute ride costs S$33 which is about $22 American. Not sure if this is normal as I never rode a giant ferris wheel before.,,,
,,Well worth a visit,4,,Did the flyer as an easy step off the open top bus and well worth a visit. As one would expect very much like the London a Eye but taller. Marina Bay and get Sands Sky Pool do look very good from the heights,,,
,,Great view of the bay,5,,You can get a great glimpse of the island not just the marina and city. You can view Changi and the seaside to Malaysia and the forest. Great activity.,,,
,,Real fun on top of the World,4,,"It is fun going up and down the flier, enjoying the views of Singapore from a height. The Flier moves slowly and hence no cause to fear or worry like in rides. Worth a visit with family or friends, not solo",,,
,,360 degree view of the city,4,,"Catch the subway to Promenade and walk about 200m towards the flyer and you are there. My family of five were fortunate enough to have a capsule to ourselves so we were able to freely move around. We did go early (around 10am) and I would imagine the attraction gets more busy during the day and views are more spectacular in the evenings. Prior to ride, there is a tunnel where you learn about history of Singapore and information about the flyer. The 30 minute ride were slow, smooth and steady. At the end of the ride, exit via the gift shop.

There is a nice hawker style food mall, for tourists, at the bottom as well (most of them opened at 12pm though).",,,
,,If you really want to view Singapore from all angles,3,,"This is the only viewpoint from the angle that looks towards the Marina Bay and the city.

If you have spare money and are a real addict to view points, then feel free to get on it.

No where as impressive as the London Eye, but an eye none-the-less.

Abit out of the way, but at least you can walk past the F1 pits to get there!",,,
,,Great views of the city,5,,Great views of the city. Was great going up there during the race weekend had a great view of the Porsche race.,,,
,,Great night out Singapore flyer,5,,"It was a great night and the view was wonderful , u overlook Singapore. The night lights are beautiful, it is also a good day time thing to do",,,
,,Limited views in the haze,2,,The capsule is aircon so the trip up was comfortable. Except for the annoying kid who keeps screaming. The haze really limit the views around so if it is there i wouldnt recommend it. Unless your ride is free then give it a go. Nice gifty shop at the end. The garden in the centre is nice. Thumb sideway.,,,
,,Fantastic view of whole city,5,,A must do thing for all Singapore travelers. Similar to the famous London Eye. A capsule cabin takes a full circle in around 30 minutes which will give you the view of whole Singapore city.,,,
,,Singapore landmark,5,,"The day we arrived in Singapore it was incredibly hazy...but we couldn't miss a ride on this city's major landmark.
There were very few other people around, so the wait to actually board the Flyer, once we proceeded through the introduction/information area, was quite short. The pods are quite large with bench seating in the middle & the windows are huge, so on a clear day the views over the city & across the marina would really be spectacular....perfect for lots of photo opportunities. It is very easy to both board & disembark the moving wheel as it travels at such a slow pace, so this ride would be suitable for just about any age, even those with a fear of heights or a touch of travel sickness. The ride takes approximately 30 mins and costs $33 per adult...perhaps a bit on the pricey side ...but it is on many peoples bucket list after all !!",,,
,,Good Value For Money,5,,"The views from here are great. You can see right over Marina Bay and the gardens by the bay. Even with the haze the city was still clear. It was fantastic to see the city at night with all the lights of the skyscrapers. The ride took around 45 minutes, but give a little more time to line up and to browse the complex afterwards.",,,
,,Romantic... if not for the Haze,5,,The haze had cleared up a bit so we decided to go up the wheel. Barely noticed it was moving. The view overlooking Marina Bay and the CBD would have been great if there weren't any haze. Watching the sun set behind the tall towers would be romantic as well. Takes 30 minutes for 1 trip.,,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,Make sure you go on a clear day to get the most of the views available. You can get fantastic overhead views of the F1 track if it's on. The flyer's movement is so smooth that it feels like you are on solid ground.,,,
,,Best to go at night,4,,On par with the Londo Eye. Best time to visit is at night so that you can see the Singapore City in lights. Its open till 10Pm only.,,,
,,Flying High,5,,"If you want an overview of the whole city then go on the flyer, well worth the trip. Fantastic for photographs.",,,
,,Good way to see Singapore - great at night,4,,"With the haze currently in Singapore I debated whether the Flyer was worth it. However if you go int he evening, the haze tends to clear and you get to see all the city lights. The journey takes about 30min and was well worth it. If you go around 7:30pm you will see the light show at marina Bay. Worth a visit.",,,
,,"No Commentary, Just a view of the city.",2,,At 33 SG$ it's expensive and there the noting great to see. The least they could have done is to provide a running commentary on short history of landmarks visible.,,,
,,fantastic views,4,,A must see for everyone fantastic views value for money. It is also close to many shopping areas.A video camera is a must,,,
,,Great view of the city,5,,Although the day had been quite hazy we decided to do the wheel anyway. Not much of a queue( because of the haze) so got straight onto the wheel. Only shared the pod with 5 other people. Getting on and off is easy as the wheel turned very slowly. Once inside there is not much of a sensation of motion so ok if you are a bit nervous of heights. The views were great. I can only imagine what it would be like on a clear day. I'm glad I had the experience.,,,
,,Great view - not too expensive,4,,We paid $33 per adult for a ride on the flyer which takes around 30min. Unfortunately we had heaps of noisy kids in our capsule so it would have been better without all the noise. There are 28 people per capsule but the capsule is big so it doesn't feel crowded and the line moves quickly because so many people are boarded at once. You need to buy your tickets on the ground floor before going up to the flyer.,,,
,,Big wheel keep on turnin...............,3,,"If you've been on 1 of these you've been on 'em all. The only difference is the view and the cost. Its reputed to be one of the Best, I'm not sure about that, but it certainly isn't one of the worst!! On a clear day you can literally see for miles, maybe glimpses of Malaysia and/or Indonesia. Without doubt the best time to take pics is when the wheel is at its zenith. It does take 30mins to complete 1 revolution at which time to have to get off.
The cost is very dear compared to others. But get this: S/pore is a Nation that relies heavily on Tourism, so what does it do to the cost of this experience, it slugs the Tourist!! That's right, if you are a Local you pay LESS than a Tourist. If this isn't discrimination I don't know what is! For those with dual citizenship that happen to be Seniors Citizen's you will get a Seniors discount provided you are a Singaporean senior.",,,
,,Another touristy attraction..,4,,"We went to the singapore flyer simply to tick the box on getting on a ferris wheel. Althouh it is on of the tallest in the world right now, this will soon change with other taller wheels under construction.

The view is breathtaking however please note that you go during clear weather and no haze, tickets once purchased will not be refunded.",,,
,,Great views,5,,Great views. Nice ride. Clean walkaround cabins. Nice location. Great photo opportunities. Pleasant staff.,,,
,,Watching sunset from Singapore flyer,4,,"Adult ticket is around $ 25-30 child ticket is $15 so it is an expensive ride for a family . Me and my family bought online tickets and went on this flyer . Took some super photos .. And witnessed the bird eye view of Singapore . We recommend to take this flyer ride after double decker city tour. Evening after the bus ride you can go in this flyer to see the sunset .
If your going to see marina bay sands don't spend on this flyer ride . Since you will see the same view from hotel roof top also",,,
,,First 15 mins was Wow! but the other was Ok...,4,,Enjoy safely the best view with view from the top. You can clearly see Marina Bay Sands and overview of Marina bay. Great view within 30 mins (Too short? I think 15-mins ride is enough for me). Finding deal on internet will save your cost ;),,,
,,Nice place,4,,"It's a nice place for looking around Singapore from above, but the entries price was a little bit expensive. Try to get some credit card promo's or hotel promo to have some discount. Bring your dslr camera with the tele lens ,is a must",,,
,,On top of Singapore,5,,Boarding the flyer is a life time experience as you can see the skyline of this country once you are on the top. But its over priced @ 33$.,,,
,,Only do if you arent staying at MBS,3,,We did this when we stayed at Marina Bay. Not really much point. Haze was bad - got the same view as our hotel room. It was OK - even the kids were a bit bored.,,,
,,Best Flyer in Asia,5,,"Great View of Singapore and the see. Cool Environment, large space & cooling. Nice if you go there at day light.",,,
,,"Didn't plan to go on it, but glad I did",4,,"I just went on it on the spur of the moment during the F1GP. I'm not a massive fan of heights, however this nothing to be afraid of. Real pretty at night. Move slowly - takes about 30 mins Great value. Feels really safe.",,,
,,Singapore's foggy horizon,5,,"The flyer is one the best and spacious flyers I have ever been to. You get plenty of space to walk around inside and take pictures. Unfortunately for me, it was a foggy day. Therefore, I couldn't see much because of the haze. Still the experience was fantastic. After you are done, take some time to explore the area for other attractions and food courts.",,,
,,Too expensive,2,,The view is quite nice however it does not justify the price paid. There are better ways to spend your money in Singapore.,,,
,,You get to see a Birds Eye view of Singapore city,5,,"Visit at Day time.
At the night time, you wont be able to admire the city's view
$ 68 for 40 minute ride is a bit expensive. If you want to save on cost, try observatory deck at ION Mall (Orchard Road) for free",,,
,,THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY TRIP.,5,,"We booked a ticket for the evening with champagne.The views were amazing.Although I am afraid of heights it was fine because it felt like being in a large cabin.It helps that the cabin moves very slowly too,",,,
,,UPLIFTING,5,,We did the night time dinner on the flyer which was very uplifting experience. I do believe the dining tour has since been cancelled. My suggestion would be to do a daytime trip and a night trip to get the full benefit of the ride.,,,
,,Really interesting,5,,The best time to visit at dark when you can see the lights if the bay. Also you can see the place where the Formel 1 drive arround. Not far away are the Giant trees and the Hotel Bay Sands.,,,
,,A refreshing and educational experience!,5,,We didnt think it would be such a great experience. And I particularly had imagined that they are over charging. However I changed my mind completely when I entered and saw its museum and experienced the interactive display. I actually learnt so much about the scientifc side of this tourist attraction!,,,
,,SINGAPORE FLYER,5,,This is singapore's answer to London eye.. The 360 view from the flyer is simply good.. I recommend to visit this place in the evening so that you see both the day light as well as night view.,,,
,,Not many people visiting so almost had the whole gondola to myself!,4,,"I came in May and due to the passing of the late Prime Minister, the crowd was at the other side of the city so the Singapore Flyer was quite empty with not many visitors. I had a fun time being in the gondola with only two other tourists. We took many photos of the surrounding as the weather was good. Only set back was signage for me to get there from City Hall MRT was a bit off. Kinda lost in the beginning on how to get there.",,,
,,Beautiful trip on the wheel,4,,We had a great time going round the flyer. Beautiful views of Singapore. Boarding process was relatively quick and well organized. Not too busy in the 'capsule'.,,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,"This is the eye wheel made for the millenemum. It is beautifully lighted up . Iwent in the day time . The weather was very very clear . We could see the beautiful green singapore with tall building looking small and blue waters all around . You can see the wheel from the sky park also . But to see singapore from cable car , sky park or singapore wheel all are splendid sights not to be missed .",,,
,,Nice Experience,4,,I have a single experience with Singapore Flyer in July 2015. I was a different level of experience you can see most of the land marks of the Singapore located around the Marina Reservoir.,,,
,,Panoramic View of the City - Just too Hot for the Day...,3,,"The Vista is just too Fantastic to ignore! Try only in the evening to view the glorious sundown and especially when there is festive fireworks around!
But avoid getting into the glass capsules during high noon or be baked in the oven though...Perhaps, the operator should instal better heat insulation ?",,,
,,Dinner in the Sky,5,,"What an amazing experience. We went for dinner in the sky to celebrate. What an experience. Epic views, amazing 4 course meal and we managed to get it all done in 2 rotations of the Flyer. A must do for couples celebrating or someone wanting to pop the question.",,,
,,Only for first timers,4,,"its a bit cliched ... but if this is your first time, give it a go. Else just take some fancy snaps with the flyer in the back :)",,,
,,Similar to London Eye,4,,"Only difference to London Eye is , Here it is air conditioned and Literally No queue as we had visited this early morning at around 10 Am. There is Combo ticket with River Cruise. Our travel agent had not included this , but I felt it is worth a Visit. Be careful of the Haze .. The view was blocked completely due to Haze",,,
,,"Dinner in the Sky, amazing experience!",5,,What an experience. I was surprised to find out that I was going to have DINNER in the sky on the flyer! We were so lucky as the haze wasn't bad at all that night and we got amazing pics. Dinner was spectacular! 4 course meal! 2 rotations on the flyer and dinner was done.,,,
,,High,5,,"The Singapore flyer is the second highest observation wheel at 165m high. It's capsule is big enough and its spins slow enough that you have ample time to take you selfie's and photos. I heard they have mentos in the emergency kit located in the capsule. The strategic location of the flyer makes it so that we can see the marina bay and the gardens by the bay. On the ground, there's even a flight simulator which is a bit expensive. Overall I like this landmark in Singapore.",,,
,,Fall in love with the city with the Flyer,5,,"The best way to fall in love with Singapore is to go to the Singapore Flyer. I have been there many times, but am still stunned with the beauty of the city, when seen from the Flyer. Its a giant wheel with very spacious cabins giving you the ultimate view of the city from different heights, as you circle around. Its not at all scary and kids will really love it. I usually do it on the day I reach Singapore, as it takes a couple of hours to complete the visit and you don't feel tired if you have come in that day after a long flight.",,,
,,"Tick, done that one.",4,,Good for the novelty but if you are going to the top of Marina Bay Sands you will get a better view and have longer to experience it. .,,,
,,great ride,5,,I have to say I went on this twice. Once in the day so I could actually see something and then on the evening to see the city alight. It was fantastic on both occasions. I know its 'sad' doing it twice but it was worth it. Tickets are fairly priced around 15 pounds depending on the exchange rate. It opens early around 8.30 and goes on until after 10 in the evening. And it takes around half an hour. Great.,,,
,,Outstanding Treat,5,,We took an evening tour from our cruise ship which included the Singapore Flyer. What a very special treat. The night time views from the wheel were unbelievable! I wouldn't want to miss this experience. The ride is a little over 30 minutes and we were lucky enough to see the light show in the gardens while on the wheel. Totally recommend doing the night time ride.,,,
,,singapores london eye,4,,great view of singapore from this attraction we had one of the pods to our self great took loads of photos ride lasts 30 mins about 33 dollars each,,,
,,Fly the Singapore Flyer...,5,,"One of the Most amazing Experiences of Singapore...If you are in Singapore or are Planning to go, you have to Fly the Singapore Flyer...
The Views from Above are Spectacular, one of the best Views in the World. You can Almost See Singapore from End to End...The Views Over the Marina and the banking District make for Exceptional Photography. You can Also see the part of the City where most of the Locals Live...Hundreds of Sky Scraper Apartment buildings. It is well worth the trip.
You could also book one of the Vessels and have your Own Private Dinner there, wish we had more time as that is exactly what i would love to do...
Another Great Thing is that in the Same Centre there is a Great Bar to quench your Thirst while you go through the Hundreds of Photographs you took...
Simply Amazing鈥?
,,view of singapore by night,5.0,,wow its extremely high but amazing I'm not fond of heights but this was amazing. Not cheap and takes half an hour.
,,Believe it or not Recommended,4.0,,I usually hate these things. Have been on one in almost every country in the world where they exist. But this was fun", and well operated. No long lines, no issues," and a decent picture."""
,,Great views of Singapore,4,,A big circle but full of sights lists to see from a high aspect. Go there with friends to enjoy the sights.,,,
,,Very good/,5,,"Excellent views. No problems getting on - usual Singaporean efficiency!! Plenty of room. Went via Hop-On Bus - took us right to ""the door"" so to speak.",,,
,,Just like any other Flyer,3,,Beautiful yet kinda boring...ride here if u want to rest after a whole day walk around .You'll gonna see the beauty and attractions of Singapore.Must try,,,
,,Worth visiting,3,,"Although it is the biggest (or at least one of the biggest) big wheel of the world, it is not so good connected to public transpotrattion (MRT). At this place the tourist hopon/hopoff buses start.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,4,,Great views not scary a must do if u go to singapore . Great feeling being above racetrack .great place to get awesome airial views,,,
,,It went nice and slow so you could take in everything,5,,"An amazing experience, would definitely do it again, did it at night time and thooughly enjoyed it. Recommend it for all..from families to singles",,,
,,360 degree beautiful view,4,,"A must , magnificent view of singapore skyline and harbour, 30 min ride , some of there capsules are concept designed . we loved it .",,,
,,Great views,5,,Recommend a night time ride to see the beautiful singapore lit up We were lucky enough to experience Fire works which were were amazing and made the skyline even better Good value for money for half hours enjoyment,,,
,,Great views,5,,I would highly recommend the Singapore Flyer it is easy to get to via MTR. It is well run and very clean. It takes about 30 minutes for a round trip. Despite the fog/pollution that we are witnessing in Singapore as a result of the fires from Indonesia and Sumatra the views are as good as they can be. I would not recommend traveling to Singapore around September or October because of the smog it does hamper views. I would definitely recommend this attraction to visitor in Singapore as it gives you a birds eye view of this wonderful city. The attendants are very friendly and helpful.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Following the advice of the driver on the way to our hotel from the airport, we visited the Singapore Flyer in the late afternoon, to get wonderful views of the city and then the city lights as the sun set. Yes we had to queue to buy tickets and to get on, but our gondola was not over filled with people and there was plenty of room to move around. A very worthwhile experience!",,,
,,Hazy days,4,,"Took an open top bus ride to the flyer with my wife and son. But difficult to know where to go once we got off the bus, but a few quick asks and we were there. Shared the cubicle with a truly nice family visiting from India. 8 per cubicle. The ride from start to finish was around 30 mins. Unfortunately we were here when the haze hung over Singapore. None the less, the views were unreal. Felt totally safe which was a necessity as my wife was a reluctant traveller. I recommend any visitor to try the big wheel. Worth every Singapore Dollar!",,,
,,Super View From Up There,5,,A ride on the Singapore Flyer is certainly worth the time & effort. About half an hour going around from base to top & down & in the process getting a most spectacular view of the city all around. The family enjoyed every moment of the ride.,,,
,,Wonderful Experience,5,,Despite the haze the view was just great. Can highly recommend this experience. Next time in Singapore I will take the ride in the evening to see the lights,,,
,,Amazing views,4,,For someone who has a great fear of heights I really did not think this one through before getting on. It was so high! But for all the fear it was worth it to see the views of Singapore. So glad I did it.,,,
,,Beautiful views but........,4,,"I surprised my friend with a visit to the Singapore Flyer which was beautifully relaxing. My friend isn't that good with heights but even she was quite comfortable.

Our 'but' moment came when our ride was over and we entered the gift shop to buy the souvenir photos that had been taken of our group.
The prices were reasonable but unfortunately for my friends and I, our order somehow got missed and we waited for over half an hour to get our photos whilst watching others come and go. When I politely asked if ours were ready after 20 mins, the staff rudely informed me that they were coming and that I had to wait. When they were finally ready, the photos we were given weren't the ones we had ordered for the souvenir frame and so we again had to wait! When our order was finally right, I asked if we could get an extra frame for the second photo to which I was told that I would have to pay. I wasn't impressed by the way we were dealt with which spoiled an otherwise pleasurable afternoon.

This is a lovely venue and if the staff were a little more friendly in the gift shop, the experience would have been perfect. Other than that, enjoy the views, take your camera and create memories.",,,
,,Great Ride,4,,This is an amazing slow ride ride that allows you to see just about all of Singapore and the ships out at sea.,,,
,,an amazing must see and do!,5,,"We loved the whole experience! We had two families with us, of all ages. The sights were spectacular by day, and would of loved to do it again at night, as singapore lights are beautiful, every which way you look.",,,
,,Fantastic view,5,,"It's a must...fab view,not too expensive! Definitely would recommend a visit especially when the Grand Prix is on",,,
,,Tremendous Experience,5,,We purposely left the flyer ride for the evening time to experience the city lights from above. It was fantastic viewing and a must do whilst visiting Singapore.,,,
,,Fabulous city views on the Flyer,5,,A must see for all visitors to Singapore. The views of the city and South China Sea can't be beat anywhere in the city...,,,
,,Amazing veiw,5,,Must visit attractions for all age groups.My kids loved it. Lovely photo apportunuity. 360 degree veiw of singapore. No need of advance booking.,,,
,,Awesome ferris wheel ride,5,,"One cannot visit Singapore without going up the flyer. Even my wife who is scared of heights took the flight, and we were not disappointed.",,,
,,Great ride,5,,The ride was great as it took around half an hour and have a whole view of Singapore perfectly! I have my own cabin and do not need to share with others!,,,
,,Great view,5,,Our ride on the Singapore Flyer gave us a great view of the wonderful modern architecture around this city.,,,
,,See the Sites from a Height!,5,,The flyer is absolutely worth a trip for the spectacular views you can get. It is very efficient and there are a selection of shops and eateries on site.,,,
,,Great view,4,,"Excellent was to see the skyline of Singapore, Marina Bay Formula 1 circuit with its grand stands were just beside Flyer, smooth operation, excellent staff.",,,
,,Quite Nice,4,,Even if you are scared of heights you will enjoy it.It takes a while but you calm down slowly. its clean and spacious and the view is breath taking,,,
,,Great Views,4,,"This big wheel is close to rail link but not too far to walk the shopping area. Early morning, 10.30 , I consider the best time before any haze spoils your view and crowds fill the carriages, which means you can move from side to side , end to end to take in the full panoramic view. |Once in it you realise just how big it is by the size f the components that its made of.",,,
,,Fantastic.,5,,We were lucky enough to have a go on this on F1 Race Day 2015. The views of the track and of the City were outstanding.,,,
,,High views at $1 per minute per person,4,,"You can get there by public transport if you catch the metro to The Promenade Station (Circle Line, CC4). The it's only a 5-minute stroll to the pedestrian bridge and the ticket office it's on the 1st floor.
We enjoyed the 33-minute ride (for $33/adult basic experience; adult rates start at age 13 in Singapore). Cabins are air conditioned and the speed of the Flyer was good and allowed plenty of time for pictures form many angles. Luckily the haze was gone at midday so visibility was superb. City and river views. The limit of 28 passengers per cabin sounds unthinkable; I think 12 people would be more than enough if you are to see anything in comfort. There were few visitors on the Saturday we went so we had only 7 people on our cabin, which was perfect. A good experience overall, as this is a view you cannot have from any of the other landmarks in the city.",,,
,,Awesome view,5,,"Great views of the city, and bay. I'm scared of heights and I wasn't scared at all. The flyer is slow moving and I found it very relaxing. Denfentley do it again when I go to Singapore",,,
,,Birds eye view of Singapore Grand Prix,5,,"Excellent views of over the city and the bay. $30 entry but as I had a Grand Prix ticket I had a discount, which was ice. All cars are air conditioned and they go nice and slow so you can take good photos.",,,
,,Beautiful!!!,4,,33$ but very much worth it. The view is the best you can get and it's amazing even if you'd think it's too hazy. The food court by the entrance is pretty good and surprisingly cheap!,,,
,,Nice view from above,5,,"I experienced riding here twoce.. The first time was evening.. And its so nice..we saw the beauty of singapore at night with so many beautiful and varieties of lights.. The second time, was during day time.. And it was also good.. We saw singapose 360 degrees..",,,
,,Get the view of beautiful Singapore...,4,,"If you want to see the Singapore from a single point, then this is the place but not the only place (Skypark is the other option).

I found it little boring as one complete rotation of wheel took nearly an hour.

You can get best views of Singapore from Flyer at night.",,,
,,Amazing View,5,,We were in Sinagpore for the Grand Prix and because the flyer is within the circuit tickets were limited to race ticket holders which meant no line and and the entry fee was discounted. Which was great. There were 4 of us and because it wasnt busy we had the pod to ourselves. I can imagine on busier days they would put up to 20 pax in each pod and to me that woud be a negitive. (stuck in a pod 135m above ground with someones screaming child or something similar... no thanks).,,,
,,Landmark Attraction of Singapore,5,,"If you are travelling to Singapore, you cannot afford to miss this beautiful, mesmerizing attraction of Singapore. Its a giant wheel on the bay area of Singapore from where you can have breathtaking,awesome and mind blowing view of the entire city. The panorama of the views from Flyer will remain in your memories for years to come.If you are lanning to visit Singapore, make sure you visit this attraction without fail.",,,
,,Great view,5,,"Sinpore Flyer was great with the kids. The time we went there was no much people, so we got a cabin only for our family. We took a lot of pictures and admire a great view.",,,
,,What a view!,5,,This is a great way to see a different side to Singapore! Well worth the time and money! Make sure you go on a clear day!,,,
,,best view of the country,5,,was planning to visit this for quite some time.. got opportunity during this visit.. had some wonderful time with friends.,,,
,,What a wonderful ride....,5,,"Our family went up on the Singapore Flyer on our trip to Singapore recently. My small kids loved it. Because there were not many people on the day of our visit, we had an entire car to ourselves. The kids just loved this. Unfortunately, because the day of our trip was rather cloudy, the view was not as food as I assume it could have been, but the ride was nevertheless well worth it. I wholeheartey recommend the Singapore yer to everyone visiting Singapore.",,,
,,Quite nice views just like from the ground,4,,"It is certainly a good experience to go around the Flyer, although quite pricy, it could be worth it if its under your budget.

It is definitely not a must do, as I believe the same views (maybe closer too) may be seen from hotels around the bay, and also along the promenade.

(y)",,,
,,Good view of marina area,5,,Wonderful view of Marina and gardens by the bay could see the start/finish of the formula one race course view was slightly dampened due to smoke from fires,,,
,,The Singapore Flyer provides stunning panoramic views of Singapore,5,,"The Singapore Flyer sits right off the edge of the Marina Bay Sands complex and provides for an unrushed, unequalled view of both Singapore's Inner Harbor as well as a look at the back harbor side of the island. Makes for excellent photo ops and provides nice insight into what is certainly an engineering marvel.",,,
,,Best while F1 Season,5,,We enjoyed every minute of our SG flyer. Specially F1 is on! Lights are so bright up. We loved the scenery & great time to capture nice photos.,,,
,,Must visit in Singapore,4,,We had gone during the September mid and it was F1 season. Please note that there are certain restrictions for traffic during this time. So we went to Suntec and then walked to this place for ten minutes. Also there will be lot of haze during the September time which may also limit the visibility. But we had a decent view of the city and nearby attractions!! and very close to the F1 track,,,
,,City views.,5,,The Flyer gives you the whole city at your fee...unfortunately the haze from the fires in Indonesia didn't help with visibility ... Was fun though.,,,
,,champagne and chocolates,5,,the special treatment made you feel special being in a lovely black and gold pod with music was magical,,,
,,Great views but you don't know what you're looking at,3,,What Thai attraction needs is a guide or some kind of commentary. You get on and just look out the windows. As someone who is new to Singapore all I could say is that j saw many buildings and roads.... The London eye has a guide and a 360 map so you can find out more about the area... That's what this is missing . Also there's no upgrade option like a champagne experience as offered in London. They are missing a trick here as we were celebrating our anniversary so would have paid more. I'm sure we wouldn't be the only ones.,,,
,,What a view,5,,The flyer at night gives a different view of the city. During my stay the F1 was on and made it a little difficult to access the flyer.,,,
,,singapore eye,4,,this flyer gives you the whole city view. it takes around 45min to complete the full round. it has a dinner/lunch facility too but for that you need to inform nd book prior then the day of booking,,,
,,Beautiful view,5,,The city is constructed so well that the wheel reflects every corner and every beauty of the country in one ride... 25 min long ride...one rotation is 25 min.. But worth a rotate,,,
,,Awesome experience!,4,,"A nice experience! A very slow turn (for about 1 hour) to allow us to appreciate the beauty of Singapore, a compact city and a modern country by itself. It's worth taking it as part of Singapore's Stopover Holiday program with Singapore Airlines.",,,
,,great view from the sky,5,,Here you in the top of Singapore you will be marvelled by the beauty of Singapore. It was an awesome view from the top.,,,
,,Fault in my expectations,3,,This is very inviting as I thought I can see a lot from above but actually I was a bit disappointed but I appreciateI hope this will improve more,,,
,,The views!,5,,"Who knew Singapore has a giant Ferris Wheel that rivals that of the London Eye? This is actually taller than the London Eye and offers amazing views of Singapore's beautiful architecture and of the marina where you'll see loads of ships waiting to go into the world's second busiest port or out to sea. I can see why people think it's a little boring because once you've reached the top and you're on your way down, you would've seen the best views so you're ready to just get off. But if you like gazing at a city from up above, you'll enjoy this. It's a great bird's eye view of an amazing city!",,,
,,Must Visit,4,,"Part of the Tour.Had been on the London Eye already.feel this is better as it offers great view of the Building,F1 Circuit and also the Sea.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,"This flyer is like any other flyer in the world . But the beauty is its location . It is in the prime and newly build area .there are very big cabins made of glass . U get get paranoic view of singapore . Garden by the bays , east coast singapore and marina bay sands . And beyond horizon the South China Sea .",,,
,,Birds Eye View,4,,"Went there with my family, almost in the evening to catch a glimpse of the city scape. Parked near adjacent building on the opposite side of the road. Found out that thgis building where the Eye is located, is also the boarding site of for the duck tours. View atop is beautiful. Our view was marred by tiny water droplets from the rain that had earlier cleared.",,,
,,its ok,3,,"it was just a one round and about 30 minutes, but nothing much to see only the buildings and establishments in singapore, but the capsule was nice and spaceous, still a good experience though",,,
,,Four stars but with a caveat.,4,,"Whether you'll enjoy the Singapore Flyer or not comes down to two things. First, do you enjoy aerial views of cities, gardens and architecture? And second, are you lucky enough to be in Singapore for the F1 grand prix? If you answer both of those 'yes' then this is an absolute must-do attraction during the Saturday practice / qualifying sessions of the F1 weekend. During the F1 event, the Flyer is only available to ticket holders and if you time it right, you get to see some racing, some pit lane action, some great views over the city and financial district and a great view of Gardens By The Bay. In fact, just after dusk would be the perfect time to take this ride.
The problem comes in whether or not I can recommend doing this for the other 51 weeks of the year. As others have noted it's a bit out of the way. The views would be stunning for sure, but it's not as 'close to everything' as - for example - the London Eye.
Honestly if you've done any large sight-seeing ferris wheel, you know what to expect here and you won't be disappointed. I'd say worth doing once. But do it after dark.",,,
,,Great views,4,,Worth a visit to get a birds eye view of Singapore. Fun to do at dusk so you get the daylight and evening views Best view of MBS,,,
,,Beautiful view of the city!,4,,"I went on the Singapore Flyer with my family (stepmom, dad, 10 month old, and boyfriend). We, as well as the baby, enjoyed the 30 min ride; the length of it made the price more worth it since it is a bit pricey (check the website for cost). But overall, I would say it's worth it because the view is beautiful--you can see Marina Bay sands, Gardens by the Bay, and the river from a 360 degree view! The capsule is clean and roomy, and when we went they didn't try to overcrowd it.

I would be interested in even going again to see the city view at night, but the price is what holds me back. It's probably best to go on a clear day/night. If you're hungry, stop by the Singapore food trail for a bite! There are also other things to do like the fish spa, etc.",,,
,,Expensive and not that great!,3,,I was a bit disappointed. All you can see from the air is high buildings and the port. Very expensive as any attraction in Singapore. I will skip it.,,,
,,One time only,3,,"This is only a one time thing, I really don't get the hype about it. The flyer is very slow, The whole round takes 40 mins, I would only recommend to go at night, but I wouldn't pay for to go on it again.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,Nice place to visit. Unique experience that gives a 360 degree view of Singapore with amazing height.,,,
,,Top views,4,,Smoke from Indonesian burn offs restricted how far you could see but it was still a great view as you slowly circle. It was interesting looking at the setting up for the Grand Prix at the time we were on this attraction.,,,
,,Very romantic at night,4,,We on during the day and at night - probably night is better and more romantic for couples given you see the colours and lights of the entire city skyline,,,
,,A must visit,4,,A must visit if you are in Singapore. You can get a full view of Singapore and its indeed beautiful. Make your visit during night time as it would give you a better view,,,
,,Very lousy experience,1,,Not worth the price tag of $33!!! This is madness pricing. Less than 20 mins on top and the whole thing moves very slowly. Will definitely never return again. I would rather spend my precious time somewhere else.,,,
,,big wheel ride,5,,Words are going to do this wheel justice. You MUST go on this Flyer if in Singapore. 100% 360 deg scenery. very recommended.,,,
,,Don't miss this,5,,"Fabulous trip, lasted around 30 minutes. I am a nervous person but really enjoyed the view. Try to go on a clear day as it was quite misty when we went although we saw the F1 Grand Prix track which was directly underneath. The day we went there was no queue and the SIA hop on bus terminates and starts there.",,,
,,Interesting View,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is a relatively new attraction & is very popular,
We went in the afternoon so we could look over the Bay & out to the Islands as well as over the City,Next time I will go at night to have a look at the City Lights.Shops & Cafes are located on site.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,4,,Superb experience to fly Singapore flyer very good view to see the whole Singapore city.and also good sight to see,,,
,,Wonderful views,5,,Singapore flyer is a very nicely made place which offers beautiful views of singapore. we went there in the evening so got beautiful evening views from the flyer. The flyer moves slowly so it gives immense time for one to soak in the views and click as many pictures as one would like. All in all a must visit in singapore.,,,
,,Great view,5,,Awesome view on perfect night definitely you will enjoy view every single minute 30mins is worth it. Must been there on night time you will see how beautiful singapore馃槉,,,
,,Skip it,3,,"Located away from the city centre there isn't much to see from here, you can save your money and time and book a window seat next time you come in to see the same amount.",,,
,,Can't beat the views,4,,"Slow moving so no vertigo and plenty of pic taking time. Right above the Singapore F1 street track. The marina, the business district, the islands and back up to Orchard spread out nicely.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer very good,4,,"Singapore flyer is very good, though not as good as London Eye. Stiil worth visiting and having ride.Surroundings are good, Water front/marina bay, shopping malls, gardens, restaurants, taxis and MRT station nearby.",,,
,,Excellent,5,,What a spectacular experience to live with your familly or friends. Awhole view of the city is guarantied from the Flayer.,,,
,,Nice view!,5,,A good place to check out the beauty of singapore at night. You can also have dinner here if you have reservation for dinner. The view is amazing! Must check out.,,,
,,Great views,5,,Enjoyed the ride and the views but just make sure that it is a nice day so recommend not pre booking just in case the weather is not so good,,,
,,Amazing,4,,Came at night and the view is amazing! The show room before you enter the Flyer also amazing! It's a must to go here,,,
,,See from the above,4,,"Go to Singapore Flyer on the night and see the lights, its pretty eventhough you can't see any views but there isn't much to shown in the afternoon either.",,,
,,great view,4,,Great views from the flyer. If you do this in the day then do top of marina bay sands hotel at night. This will give you the same views but different lights. The pictures from the top come out great. It does get a little boring as it is slow but a must do.,,,
,,Singapore in a snapshot,4,,Beautiful in the night. Few snapshots that would definitely make you go for this attraction. Entry is slightly expensive (Sgd 33 - adults) but if you carry your passport/boarding pass you get 50% disc,,,
,,Singapore Flight,5,,"This is a must-do while in Singapore! I'd also recommend that people do it at night as well as during the day. The views are great and the whole attraction is very well organised and run, as you would expect. Getting there and back is easy, as there are always taxis at the Flyer. I don't know when would be a good time to go to ensure it's not busy - it is a very popular attraction. The story of the development and construction is also very interesting.",,,
,,a wonderful view 鈥?when there is no smog,4,,the flyer itself was lovely. air conditioned and 360 degree views. sadly the fires in indonesia had thick smoke blanketing the city and the view was sadly reduced. we still enjoyed the air-conditioned half hour travel.,,,
,,"What a fantastic ride,while meeting very nice peo9le inthe same carrige.",5,,The view war relly terrific! The sights of Singapore just were amazing.we also met nice people in the carriage. We would certainly do it again.,,,
,,"If you can manage, go at sunset!",5,,"The Singapore Flyer affords great views of the city that you can't get other places. If you can time it to get on just as the sun starts to go down, you can take pictures of the city with a variety of colors in the background. And, if you're afraid of heights, fear not! The ride is super smooth and doesn't make you feel uncomfortable at all.",,,
,,A must do thing when in Singapore,5,,This is not a cheap experience at 33 dollars per adult but well worth it. The cars are air conditioned which is great and the whole experience lasts around thirty minutes .We went late afternoon and there were no queues at that time. As you would expect the views were fantastic,,,
,,Singapore flyer poor value,3,,The complete ride lasts for 30 minutes and due to the hazy weather it was disappointing. The price is overly expensive,,,
,,the view,5,,About half an hour full circle with 360 degrees panoramic views so make sure you take the camera. Also good value and there would be very few other locations you would get these views if any,,,
,,Slow n lazy,3,,Its a 30 min ride where can can a 360 degree view of Singapore. Lovely view when you reach the top but that's it. Nothing else you can expect from the flyer. It gets quite dizzy while going up n down while it's very slow.,,,
,,Snapshot of Singapore,4,,The Singapore Flyer differs from the London eye in the sense that it never stops. The entry and exit from the capsules is done even as the flyer is moving but it is done very smoothly and is not a challenge.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,$33 and well worth the 1/2 hr trip at night after the laser show. Was a bit hazy on the night which was disappointing.,,,
,,Great place to see the whole Singapore,5,,I would definitely recommended for all visitors that don't have too much time in Singapore. We went there only for one day and we didn't have much time for the tourist stuff. We chose Singapore Flyer around 9.30 pm (I think you can enter it until 10.15 PM) and it was splendid! I love cities by night and it was pretty amazing to look on the Singapore from that height when all the lights are turned on. You'll love that!,,,
,,Amazing view!,5,,Great ride up! Amazing skyline seeing the landscape of Singapore! when the skies are clear you can see some of the Indon islands too!,,,
,,Totally breathtaking,5,,One of Singapore list of must do. Come and be spell bound by the sights to be seen from amazing heights. The local folk are happy to ensure your visit is an experience to take home and talk about with local transport cheap and cheerful running regularly to make sure you get to your destination safely. Come have a look for yourself and see if you agree with me what a heartztopping breath taking background of busy singapore 3at it's best,,,
,,This is an average giant wheel!,3,,This is an average giant wheel! It is slow but very big cabin but not really worth for the money. It has nice restaurants underneath the Flyer.,,,
,,Terrific way to see the city,4,,Ride is about 30 minutes or so. Views are incredible. We went on a not so busy day so almost had the chance of having the capsule to ourselves. Capsules are moving (slowly) as you get in/get out so can be a little disconcerting but there is a safety net below.,,,
,,Great for taking amazing pics of the city,5,,So glad we did this a fabulous experience with such amazing views of he city we went at night time around 8pm the pods were nice and we managed to take some really beautiful pictures. I would say even if your visiting Singapore for just 2 days try and fit this in you will not regret it.,,,
,,"Night view is beautiful.. but if u want to see city and land till far, go in day time",5,,"Wonderful experience!! I was amazed by it's construction.. it's massive!! My title, says it all :-) there is also an option of booking a private cabin with some culinary options for a romantic date.. check with the reception/ticket counter there...",,,
,,Great views,5,,LovEly experience - nice slow pace - great city views - there is an evening dinner available on some cars which must be very romantic,,,
,,excellent tourist attraction,5,,"we have been here a few times, great all round view, good value for money, best at night, it has a great view of Singapore and the night lights are beautiful",,,
,,Total Package in SG,3,,"This will wrapped up you whole Singapore trip. When you're inside the capsule going higher, you'll feel happy to experience this wonderful ride. And after going here, you can walk your way to meet Merlion :)",,,
,,Worth visiting,4,,A good twenty minute trip. Make sure its a clear day as the haze in Singapore obviously impacts the view and the cost for a family is not cheap. It is pretty obvious what you get for your money but it is well run and efficient and well maintained,,,
,,Stunning views of Singapore,5,,"If in Singapore, definitely take a moment to ride the Flyer ""Ferris Wheel"". Stunning views of Singapore from every angle.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,Did the Singapore flyer he exhibitions were ok en route to winding our way to the wheel. Views are extensive and would have been sensational had the skies been clearer due to fires burning in Indonesia,,,
,,Breathtaking Views of Singapore !!!,5,,"Bird eye views of Singapore ,Loved it ..!!!
You have also the option from Marina Bay Sands ,to get the view of Singapore but Ill recommend by flyer as It gives the views at different elevations . A 30min of roller coaster ride in slow pace ...!!! Fabulous ,Incredible and Aerial Views and Of Course a Must See place of SINGAPORE !!! :)",,,
,,Nice view,3,,"Really nice view. You can see the main landscapes, but a litle bit boring for me. The ride takes lot of time.",,,
,,Not for you if you don't like heights,5,,"Expensive, but at least you are on board for a decent amount of time - in fact we got off at the half way point thinking it was over, only to realise that it wasn't, so got straight back on board. Amazing views of Sentosa and the harbour as you return to Mt Faber. Right over the top of the Pacific Jewel sitting in the harbour waiting for us to board the next day.",,,
,,Awesome experience,5,,This is a must do activity in Singapore we enjoyed like any thing with our children about half an hour almost you can cover Singapore on a areal route,,,
,,Overhyped,2,,"Seriously overhyped and not worth the queues at all!
Firstly- the whole building at Singapore flyer is almost dead! There is a limited choice of dining options!!!
Secondly - view at the top is limited, and the whole experience is over in 45 minutes!
The money is better well spent at Skypark at marina bay sands!",,,
,,Worth Experiencing,5,,This is a large flyer. This is located at Marina Bay. The flyer takes around 1 hour to complete the whole circle and you can view the whole singapore from top.,,,
,,Awesome way to see the city,5,,"Second Tallest Ferris Wheel in the World and worth every penny. We walked right up with no wait during the day on a weekday. It is something like $25 US for a ticket, but the ride is about 30 minutes. The cars hold 28 people, but we had a car all to ourselves. Some even had tables and chairs inside so I guess you could pay a bunch to eat as you went around. Doing this at night would be incredible. Make sure you take a camera. I don't love heights, but had no problem with this as it is very, very smooth and you cannot tell you are even moving at times.",,,
,,One of the most attractive visiting place in Singapore,5,,"Nice experiece. We have been to the same in Melbourne, Australia. But this flyer is a bit bigger in size than the previous one. From inside, it is very spacious. View as awesome in night and in night it keeps changing the colour continuously.",,,
,,Don't waste time,2,,Nothing much to see for there is nothing new compare to other eyes (Flyers) in other cities. Must as well visit the spectators deck on 57th floor at MBS hotel.,,,
,,Always fun,4,,Great to see the skyline...not as full of tourists as I would have anticipated. Not much to say really,,,
,,awesome,5,,We did the singapore flyer on the day we arrived with the singapore sling and we really enjoyed it loved having that view of singapore and to enjoy a singapore sling while going around it is awesome,,,
,,Singapore flyer,4,,"As good as the london eye, great views of the city , a relaxing forty minutes for the whole family , it was enjoyable",,,
,,great photo opportunities,4,,Sky relatively clear on our trip on Singapore flyer. Fantastic photo opportunities. Carriages are large and safe. There were 6 people in our carriage and all were relatively empty. They can fit up to 28 people. Think this would be a bit claustrophobic. Journey takes 30 mins and moves slowly. Great views,,,
,,Good view,4,,If you can't go to top of marina bay sands.. go to Singapore flyer and witness the amazing skyline of this eye pleasing city.,,,
,,Incredible Views,4,,"If you want incredible views over Singapore, the flyer is the more fun way to do it. In addition to the views, it also offers dining options. The complex around the flyer has the normal souvenir shops and entertainment options. The flyer itself is a giant ferris wheel with several cylindrical glass capsules at regular intervals. The capsules rotate with the flyer so that the floor is always level. The capsules are encapsulated in glass and offer 360 degree views over Singapore.

A must see attraction in Singapore. Maker sure to go on a clear day to enjoy the best views.",,,
,,A highest attraction in Singapore!,5,,Dare to see the beautiful view of Singapore from the highest place? You have to try this attraction.. And you will never forget how wonderful Singapore is!,,,
,,You can see whole city & sea together from here,4,,"It is a well known place and like other flyer, I only recommend if you never have any other. But the view from the top is amazing and you can see whole city & sea together",,,
,,Must do - The S Flyer,5,,One of the best modern infrastructure in the world. Breath taking view and great experience when the wheel reaches at the top. The one hour ride gives a total picture of the city. Advice : Should go for the family ticket as it is cheaper even than what is available online.,,,
,,Fabulous views,5,,Another must do when you are in Singapore - however it is not for the faint heated. It offers fabulous views over the city and beyond. Try to go on a clear day as you can see into malyasia etc. The tour before the wheel is very informative and interesting.,,,
,,Expected More,3,,"We expected more. I cannot really say what was missing, but it was not as awe inspiring as I had imagined. This was one of the first activities that we committed to during our short stay in Singapore. I read several reviews stating it was a waste of time and money. While I wouldn't say ""Don't do it,"" it would not be a top recommendation. The city was crazy busy during our stay . . . you would not say so from this area. There were very few people in line -- bonus for us! We had originally planned on doing the meal/cocktail promotion -- glad we did not stay that long.

Overall, we enjoyed. Would not do again. Probably need a very good camera to get any decent pics from so high up. We went in the night time and used our IPad camera (not retina) can pick out very little. So we quit taking pics and just decided to enjoy the ride instead.",,,
,,Best thing to do in Singapore!,5,,"An excellent overview of the city, harbour, ships at sea. Even for people with a fear of heights, it moves so slowly that you don't even know you are moving. $30 for 30 minutes - but pick a clear day! A short walk to the wharf from here gets you to the jetty for a river cruise, perfect way to end your trip.",,,
,,Excellent Experience,5,,"We went on this in the day time & had a great time, the views were to die for, I would recommend that you go early rather than later to avoid any queing. The staff are very professional & the pods were kept very clean.",,,
,,Great view of Singapore!,3,,"It was not scary after all! If you want to have great view of the city in 30 mins, this is it! The Singapore flyer allows you to get a 360 view of this fantastic city!",,,
,,Worth a visit when in Singapore,4,,Visited the Singapore Flyer on a clear day (around 11 am) and got stunning views of the city skyline. Definitely a must see when in Singapore.,,,
,,Amazing experience!,5,,"After entering Singapore me and my wife saw a big round thing that can easily be named as merry-go-round, we came to know the name of it and also its a tourist place. So we decided to visit. We had our tickets earlier and went to the Singapore Flyer at evening as everybody says the flyer looks gorgeous at nights. The way to the flyer was very easy, the near we came my wife started to startle as she was unsure about the how the people hop on and off as the flyer is constantly on the move! Anyways, the time came and with caution we hopped on to the flyer. It was an amazing experience from then! Gradually we were at the top of Singapore, everything can be seen! All the lights in the city made it more beautiful. The only thing we missed were good quality pictures as it was night and there now sufficient light inside to take good pictures, however our 'sigh' was soon gone when we hopped off and went on to the shop. At the point of entrance the staff took a picture of us, i thought it was for record keeping but we were surprised to see that they have decorated our picture with different backgrounds of the flyer! We were so happy as all of the pictures were amazing, so out of 5 we bought 3 different backgrounds and headed home. Ohh there are great foods at the ground level and u should try it while going back.",,,
,,Must visit place in Singapore,4,,It was really nice experience.If you want to see the whole Singapore from sky you must visit here.As a traveler this is one of the places that you must visit in your Singapore tour. There are many restaurants near by with different variety of foods with quite affordable price.,,,
,,A great way to see the city,4,,"This is a great way to see the city from above, just have to try and do this on a clear day (which can be a challenge in Singapore).",,,
,,Evening beautiful city scene,4,,"For Asian travelers, Singapore flyer should be one of the ""must go"" site as there are not much small cities in Asia that you can go such great height and capture this little red dot magnificent view of a garden city under your feet.. I would suggest to go in the later evening so that you could capture the beautiful sunset by the marina barrage follow up the lights up at garden by the bay... Not forgetting to mention those local delights you can try at the ground level of the flyer or if you want to have a more ""alfresco"" street dinning feel walk up another 10mins to ""colours by the bay"" open air hawker to enjoy the nice local food and the atmosphere of the late 60s/70s of Singapore then is at its peak on weekends.. :)",,,
,,Great Views!,5,,"The best views of the entire city-state! Well worth the ticket. a full 30-40 minutes ""flying"" over Singapore!",,,
,,Bird's eye view of Singapore,5,,"It is a must see in Singapore, a magnificent bird鈥檚 eye view from the sky. Best time is the evening, when you can see the beautiful skyline of Singapore, 360掳 degree view of the city with its night time illuminations. There is a package for the family too which is a money saver.",,,
,,Lovely way to see Singapore,5,,Definitely worth a visit. Lots of opportunities to take photos and gives you a birds eye view of the area,,,
,,A must do.,4,,"Another must do when in Singapore. You get a great view of the harbor surrounding area. We went on it were the only ones in our gondola, fantastic.",,,
,,Wonderful photo opportunity -place,4,,"Excellent place to visit. Views are just great and the location for taking quality photos (great selfies) is wonderful. But be aware, do not go if there is crowd. You cannot see anything nor can you take good photos. If you have money to spend, book an evening dinner and dine in the cabin.",,,
,,S Flyer,4,,It's a marvelous experience to be a rider of Singapore flyer. Beutifull view of infrastucture exellence of singapore from top. It may be look coastly. But it's value for money.,,,
,,Get the whole view of Singapore!,5,,"I went when it was the tallest observation wheel in the world. Now Las Vegas' wheel is only 9"" taller I think. This was one of my favorite things I did when I was in Singapore. You see the entire island and then some. The trip is smooth and you can't even tell you're moving.",,,
,,Must visit,4,,Must visit to have a splendid view of the city. Gives a good view of land water and buildings around this area.,,,
,,Once around the block.,3,,"The 35-40 minute trip on the flyer should be high on your list of ""to Dos"" in Singapore if visiting just for a while. Naturally if you choose a clear day you get spectacular views of Southern Singapore and across to the main Riau island of batam and Bintan.

The ships, port, f1 start - finish straight and Sentosa are clear as are the Gardens by the bay and the public golf course of Marina Bay. There are plenty of private and, one public, photo opportunities. In the vicinity there are a good range of restaurants from low cost food court style to upper end Indian and Chinese.

In the same block one can see a wee garden, fly a 737 (simulator) and more. It is easy walking distance from the promenade (circle line) MRT and is served by buses too.

If you have a small group it is usually simple to have a capsule to yourselves.

Suitable for children and quite elderly people as you can sit during the 'flight'.",,,
,,disappointed,3,,"took the ride expecting a lot more, but simply pit its just an icon representing a wonderful structure. view is OK, but you never know when you are at the top , until you are past the top point",,,
,,ok,4,,It was a good view from the the top and from all the sides. It was exciting at first then gets a little boring after.,,,
,,Fly high....,5,,"It was the night when we arrived at Singapore.... It was hot and we were tired....but when we arrived at the flyer even my kids jumped to visit.....felt the flyer's promotion a bit exaggerated....nevertheless, the city looked fantastic in the night lights....skyscraper, marina bay sands behind towering like a mountain.... Gardens by the bay, all can be seen clearly.
Tips: to know which place is in what direction, take the city tour first and then flyer next.
Tickets are easily available.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer is good,4,,"Views are spectacular. If it would have been clear weather it would have been even better. A definite ""must-go"" for everybody visiting Singapore!",,,
,,Insane sight,5,,"That wheel is a MUST of Singapore. When it reaches the top, it is possible to see an insane sight of the city and the skyline. I reccomend to go at sunset or during the night. It can enjoy lights of buildings!",,,
,,Great way to see a view of Singapore - a bit expensive,4,,"After visiting Marina Bay Sands Skypark yesterday, we went on the Singapore Flyer today.

The Singapore Flyer is $33 entry and is more expensive than the Skypark. The Flyer does one loop and then you're off, and you get great views of the Singapore skyline.

Whilst it was recommended to go at dusk, we were there around 6pm and the line was very small. At dusk, the line was getting fairly long as people wanted to see Gardens by the Bay and the city lit up at night.

We preferred the daytime and went to Merlion Park after dusk, which provided great views of the laser show from Marina Bay Sands, which we wouldn't have got from being on the Singapore Flyer.

It was great to visit, however I'd recommend only doing one of the Skypark or the Flyer if you're visiting.",,,
,,Boring,2,,This is a HUGE giant wheel but noting great. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Overall a boring experience and a waste of money.,,,
,,Two for one!,5,,"The Flyer, like the London Eye, gives great views. Our taxi driver advised us to go at about 6.30 which we did, and he was right we went up in daylight and came down at night. Quite a different view. Owing to the proximity to the equator there is very little twilight and so you go very quickly from day to night. Great!",,,
,,the view.,4,,very exciting going all the way round the view was spectacular. It was over cast the day we went so we could only see so far.,,,
,,Flying,5,,"Singapore flyer is fantastic the view over the harbour,marina bay you can also see the skypark hotel with its no1 tower no2 tower and also no 3 tower.the pods on on the flyer are quite big and theirs glass all around so theirs nothing you can't see and if your racing fan the track is just below the flyer",,,
,,Easy to get to for a nice ride!,5,,We used to SIA hop on hop off bus to get here. The flyer took half an hour for the whole way around which was a good amount of time to get great city views! There was a museum type walk through and a short line. The capsules were air conditioned which was great for a hot day!,,,
,,Amazing sight,5,,"That's amazing trip by Singapor Flyer,you can see all the harbor of marina bay,From the ""Garden by the bay"" to the downtown.It's a unforgettable nigth!!",,,
,,just alright. gets boring after a while.,3,,"the singapore flyer is iconic in singapore. and since my husband was touring singapore for the first time with me, we decided to go on a ride. its ok for the view. but really not worth the time as it gets boring after a few minutes.",,,
,,Complete view of City...,5,,"Birds Eye view of city is Singapore Flyer.. View from there is beautiful and must experience one. You can see Marina Bay Sands, Merlion, Gardens By the Bay, Neverending Sea, Just Beautiful cant express in words.. Beautiful..",,,
,,STUNNING VIEW,5,,"view is just stunning..... it is a must when visiting Singapore, we went early in week and there was NO waiting",,,
,,Ho hum,2,,"This is one of the must do attractions for tourists. My 2 cents worth though:
1. Too expensive
At $33 a pop for less than 30 minutes on the flyer, it feels like burning too much for too little time
2. It could do with a little bit more life.
The food stalls, shops, even the workers feel loke they're just going through the motions of another day.
3. Something more
I feel like there are some improvements that can be made to the place. Don't get me wrong, the place is absolutely beautiful. But there is potential to be unlocked in this place, i believe.

All in all, if you're looking for somewhere for photo ops, I'd say Marina Bay Sands view deck is a better choice since you can actually stay for as long as you want and are not limited by plexiglass panels around.",,,
,,Great view of the city at night,4,,"It would probably look plain in the daytime is my guess. I got to the flyer 1 to 1.5 hrs to closing time. There was a short queue at the ticket counter. Also, there was no queue to enter and there were only 3 of us, including me, in the air-conditioned cabin. It moved very slowly and lasted 30 minutes.",,,
,,Not unlike other cities,2,,"Very touristy and just like other ferris wheels in urban cities. Nothing to write home about. We decided to pay for this ride to get a good view of the city. Perhaps if it were located closer to the middle of the downtown area instead of on the outskirts of the business district, there would have been more to see.",,,
,,Not to be missed,4,,A wonderful experience but the staff wasn't really friendly. I understand that alot of the staff are Chinese but hey - you guys got to be a bit slow and patient with foreigners. Not every individual understands your fast SingLish!,,,
,,Wow views,5,,"If you want to view Marina bay in its full glory, this is the place. The 30 mins journey gives you mesmerizing views of CBD of Singapore.",,,
,,Nice view,4,,the view is excellent love it can see the whole of Singapore bay it is really an eye opener I find that it is Convenient and located near some hotels,,,
,,Good views of Singapore,4,,"We visited the wheel on a week day (Weds).
There was no queue and we were able to get our ticket and get on the wheel very quickly.
As it wasn鈥檛 busy there were only 8 in our pod but it was big enough for more people.
The pods were air conditioned. The wheel provided excellent views of Singapore and beyond, especially on a clear day.",,,
,,Good Condition And View,4,,"It was very exciting especially since it is slow and it also gives you a good view of Marina Bay and it was in good condition with very clean floors(I mean it). However, there is one point I must mention. It is that you MUST go to the toilet before entering as there are no toilets and the ride is very long.",,,
,,Amazing skyline,5,,There are some good restaurants around the flyer you must try. Going up the flyer is a cool thing to do. Try to go at night. The skyline is just amazing.,,,
,,"Okay, so it's just a wheel, but it's a really good one!",4,,"Any giant Ferris wheel (and face it, most large cities have one now), is just a Ferris wheel with a slightly better view. This one has the advantage of being very big and having great views of Singapore, especially at night (I would recommend the evening as you will see all the sights including the trees, the harbour, the business district and the bay). We went with kids (9 and 7) and it was just about the right length of time.",,,
,,crowded but lovely!,4,,The line to get on was long but the view was worth it! Definitely something fun to do at night! Loved the view of Marina Bay,,,
,,鈥淎 must place to experiece鈥?5.0,,A must when in Singapore. The cars hold around a dozen people but when we went it was just seven of us friends so plenty of room to move and fantastic views. it takes about a hour to go right round.,,,,
,,Expensive price for only 30 minutes,3,,"You can view many famous places of Singapore from this, like: Merlion, Marina Bay Sands, Theater by the bay... within 30 mins. Should come here at night for a better view. You can also book the sky dining here for a romantic dinner",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Great views of the city. Helpful staff and we only did one loop, but saw a Romance car just one group in front of us and it looked like a top notch romantic dinner experience. Will try that with the wife next time.",,,
,,Great,5,,Lovely views safe environment spacious and clean. The adventure takes about 45 min so be sure to eat and visit the toilet before,,,
,,Should NOT miss.,5,,"I took time around 11-12 am. I was afraid it would be hot but it's NOT beacuse of air-conditioner inside. Moreover, at noon , the sunlight will make you have great photos and clear view.

The officer was nice. They accept to seperate me from prior big group tour as my request. So that my cabin had only 3 persons. So Private and impressive time for me!!",,,
,,Great view,4,,Probably wouldn't have bothered with this if it weren't free with the SIA package. Great view of course in a very pretty complex. Plenty of shopping and food around as well.,,,
,,As expected,3,,Just another Ferris wheel really with good views. - not value for money - tourist trap - just average Best part is the Singaporean food court on the ground floor!,,,
,,Good view,5,,"See singapore from the top, a wonderful experince. I came on afternoon it was nice. U can see the river etc maybe next time i shud try to come at night. Shud be a different experience..",,,
,,"Great views, despite being quiet insist on sharing pods",2,,"The views from this attractions are undoubtedly superb, however we went and there was no line. Seeing another couple come out from a pod solo we asked if we could have a pod to ourselves and were told no and instead they let empty capsules go (we had an empty one before and after U.S.). Aside from this all the staff at the attraction weren't talking to customers and seemed more interested in talking with one another. Shame as I was interested in taking one of the premium packages next time but with service like this, will be spending elsewhere",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Had a nice late night trip in the flyer, just before closing time. Not too many visitors late night which was good.

Views were great, but taking photos was somewhat difficult because of the lights in the cabin reflecting from the inside. Still I enjoyed the ride and the view, and will probably take the ride at daytime too when i get the chance.",,,
,,Nice!!,4,,Gives you a birds eye view of the city and beyond. Mind you the wheel moves a bit slowly and the package includes one round.,,,
,,Love the Flyer,5,,"I have wanted to go for a ride on this since it was first built but the place was so busy and crowded when I visited the year it opened, This time it was very quiet we had a car to ourselves and the view was amazing.",,,
,,MUST MUST Visit,5,,"Really astonishing to see Singapore from Height. marina area. Floating Football Ground , Marina Bay Sand , Stadium , Each & Every Thing you want to see , can see . Better to go in Morning .Cabins are fully Safe",,,
,,good view in big wheel in sg,4,,"The sg flyer is great with a very big cabinet. The night view there is fantastic, speed of rotation is fine for view and photography.",,,
,,Another experince far from London,5,,"Its must if you visit singapore. Its centrally located near to Marina Bay. Everything is near (food courts, mall, public transport) etc etc.. The price is reasonable for this extraordinary experience.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Great view over the river. Large and air conditioned capsules. Beautiful gardens to walk after you are done with Flyer. Worth a visit,,,
,,Not worth the 30$,3,,The ride is veeeeery slow. The view quite nice though I believe Marina at the Bay offers a better view.,,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,Just awesome view of Singapore from flyer. Prefer to in the evening. It gives all lighting view of a city.,,,
,,Witness Singapore's amazing skyline,5,,"This is a one of a kind experience for first time travelers to Singapore. So, if you have enough time, go ahead and try this attraction. Come late around 6PM to past 7PM so you can see how amazing Singapore's landscape is both in the day and at night when all the lights are on. Get your cameras ready when the wheel starts turning. You'll be amazed by the terrific sight up there! Savor every moment on top.",,,
,,Amazing view,5,,As this is currently the largest wheel in the world I could not miss it. It travels very slowly so you can capture lots of photos and take in the great view. Well worth it.,,,
,,Nice way to see the city landmarks from the top,5,,Nice to be on there and get to see the landmarks of Singapore City. It's better to ride it at night so you get to see the lights of the city. It can be a bit boring though as it moves pretty slow and the view overall is nothing really special to be excited for.,,,
,,Not the best view,3,,"If you already went to the marina sands observation deck or if you're staying in high floors in any neaeby hotel don't go there since it doesn't offer you a new or different view from the rest
They also pack you inside the capsule and many people wont find a seat and will be standing through the whole trip",,,
,,Nice flyer in singapore,4,,It's a very good place in Singapore. You can see aeriel view of entire Singapore. To complete this ride you will get the time of 35 minutes. You will relax in a capsule glass type lift which will round the clock.,,,
,,Great way to view Singapore at a leisurely pace,4,,"Great view of the city and marina area, with plenty of time to take it all in. The entry is a bit of a maze, but well worth it.",,,
,,Flyer that don't gets you acrophobic!,5,,The Singapore flyer is one of its kind and beautifully located that you could see far end of the City and beyond. You can go with a family of 6 or so easily in one ride. Suggest you to venture this place on a bright sunny day to gain good visuals.,,,
,,Well worth doing,5,,"We bought tickets as part of our Hop On Hop off bus package so getting there and back was relatively easy. This was well worth doing, the views were amazing and the kids remained entertained for the full half hour with the views and observing things from a great height. We shared the capsule with another couple, but there was plenty of room to see and move about to get different views.",,,
,,An amazing view of Singapore.,4,,The Flyer was a great activity to do late afternoon as it wasn't so busy. It's only thirty minutes to go round yet the views that you get are just brilliant. A strange sensation as you don't feel like you're moving then suddenly you're at the top of the wheel! Well worth it to get to see the wonder that is Singapore.,,,
,,Best to visit during sunset,3,,You'll have a bird's eye view of Singapore. It showcase the country's business district area and the Marina waters. It is best to ride the flyer during sunset.,,,
,,Famous attraction to see the landscape of Singapore through the highness,5,,"Most wanted places to see the beautiful of Singapore landscape through the highness, very recommended to see come at night while you can see the city of Singapore and its sparkling lights.",,,
,,View from the Top,5,,A lot of people feel that they can do justice to the beautiful views of the Singapore skyline from any of the numerous high-rise buildings but I strongly believe that the Singapore flyer is the best option to take in the sights. We first rode the Singapore Flyer on our previous trip in 2008 and the views now highlighted the significant additions to the city landscape in the last seven years. The views from the top are the most breathtaking and a wonderful place to click pictures as the movement is slow and smooth. I would suggest that you choose a clear and sunny day for the best views (We opted for early mornings on both occasions). The capsule is spacious enough to walk around and because of the full glass capsule you can even choose to remain seated for the duration of the ride. Please fit in this attraction in your itinerary especially if you are a first time visitor.,,,
,,Definitely worth the vies at sunset,5,,"We booked the Mo毛t package here which was great. We didn't have to queue, we waited in a nice lounge and then had a set time to go on.
Our pod was done out with Mo毛t branding, we had comfortable seats and obviously a lovely glass of the bubbles stuff along with chocolates and strawberries.

Definitely recommend booking this package at 7pm during August as we saw the skyline in the daylight and darkness.",,,
,,Must ride in Singapore,5,,30 minutes to completed the round. Must to visit. Evening time is the best time to ride. 30SingD worth the ride. arial view of most of singapore just on marina bay,,,
,,Fly at the Day time view,4,,+ Ticket price is 33 SGD / Adult + It's takes about 30 minutes for each round + Night time better view than Day time +,,,
,,Great view of the City at night,5,,After a 25th Wedding Anniversary Dinner at Raffles we finished the evening with a ride on the Flyer. We were virtually the last capsule of the night with only 6 onboard which made it easy to get some great photos.,,,
,,Not great but not bad,3,,"Against the backdrop of the city skyline, this place is a bit of eye candy and like the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Merlion stands today as one of Singapore's icons.

In terms of actually going for a ride, I do not recommend. Firstly, the ride costs $33 per adult and lasts 30 mins. This is bad because you are essentially going to have to spend the next half an hour with some other people and 9 times out of 10, they are going to ruin the experience for you a little. If you can tolerate that, the view is intriguing but only until 15 mind when the cab is at its highest. One thing to note is that you are actually very far away from either Boat Quay or Marina Bay meaning you're going to have to walk about 15 to 20 minutes to get to the nearest area of interest.

A much better alternative would be to visit the top of the Marina Bay Sands where you can have a drink and take all the time you need. Keep in mind however that not only will this cost $10 but it can also get quite noisy and crowded sometime on the weekend.",,,
,,awesome,5,,nice. can see whole singapore. every group member enjoy. very good location so get very good view.amazing.,,,
,,Excited,5,,I don't know what to say more about this Flyer... Just go there and you will get a thousand emotions !!! It rotates very slowly so you have enough time to make a plenty beautiful photos. Normally 10 visitors per cabin so you'll be not alone),,,
,,Do it twice if you can - Day and Night,4,,"Day and night views are just as fantastic. Brought couple of business visitors and overseas friends to the Singapore Flyer, they enjoyed it. Hope there are more interesting shops or restaurants to hang out in that area. Can put your selfie stick to good use.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Experience breathtaking, panoramic views on the world鈥檚 largest observation wheel (outside United States). For locals and tourists alike, there is only one place in Singapore that offers a bird鈥檚 eye view of the entire island city 鈥?Singapore Flyer. The 165-meter-high Flyer is Singapore's answer to the London Eye. For the moment, it is the world's largest observation wheel (that title will go to Beijing when its version opens in 2009). Despite much fanfare and hype, the locals have never really taken to the Flyer, grousing that it's too far from anywhere (it's not) and S$29.50 is a lot of money to pay for a 30-minute ride. Lucky you, since this means you'll almost never have to wait in line. The best time to hitch a ride is at dusk when the entire row of downtown skyscrapers is softly lit. Back on the ground, head for a dinner of chili crabs at Seafood Paradise. Address: 30 Raffles Ave, Singapore 039803
Construction started: September 25, 2005
Opened: February 11, 2008
Height: 165 m
Hours: Open today 路 8:30 am 鈥?10:30 pm",,,
,,Great views at night,4,,This is a good place to get a panoramic view of Singapore bay area. Best visited after the sun has set. It is a tad expensive though.Each rotation takes about 30 minutes.Keep those cameras ready to take some snaps of the marina bay area.,,,
,,A bubble floating over Singapore,5,,Like being in a bubble floating over Singapore. I gave up counting the ships in the bay at 73. When I first came to the city there were probably ships at anchor where the Flyer stands.,,,
,,Great Views,4,,"Well worth going on with great views of Singapore and the harbor, couldn't believe the amount of ships parked in the bay.",,,
,,Amazing view with Amazing wheel,4,,Ticket cost 29.90$ per pax and its really worth it.About 30 minute for one round so you can enjoy the ride.,,,
,,Wonderful Engineering and Great View!,4,,"The Singapore flyer was great, late at night there wasn't much queue at all. Fascinating to see how the whole capsule spins opposite to the main wheel from an engineering point of view. The views itself are very nice.",,,
,,Better at night,3,,"Maybe I'm a bit bored with these things, but this didn't live up to the hype. I think a night time ride would be better",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Singapore Flyer...wow...really awesome...the biggest flyer in the world...u can go inside the cube and will take you up and u can see all the city skyline in spore...better u go there at night,,,
,,Good views,3,,"The weather was quite fair although we still couldn't really see that far, there was no queue at all, we were on within about 5 minutes.

I'd say the London Eye was better as there's more to see, with this wheel you kind of only see to the cranes near the building although the price was pretty good at $31 each so just over 拢15 each

Great to say I've been there and done it, probably wouldn't do it again although you wouldn't need to.",,,
,,amazing 360 degree views,5,,"Reasonably priced , well organised with a view of Singapore that is hard to beat. In hind site I would rather have gone at night to get a better effect, especially with the garden that would be lit up. Money well spent in Singapore.",,,
,,Best view of the bay,4,,Enjoy the best view of the bay and the city in 360 degrees. Cabins are comfortable with air-conditioning and seats for a rest. Save more with a package which includes a ride on the Flyer and other attractions.,,,
,,Must see in Singapore,5,,This is amongst the list of the must see in Singapore. My recommendation: spend the afternoon in the Gardens by the bay and head to the Singapore Flyer to get there just before sunset (check daily timing for that!) Get on board with he day light and spend the hour seeing how the night embraces Singapore and the city lights up. Once down take a walk by the marina bay towards the riverside & one of the small restaurants you'll find there for a great dinner. Enjoy it!!,,,
,,nice experience at night time,4,,singapore flyer is an amazing experience but the wait time is a bit more at night near to mrt walkable distance,,,
,,when you have spare time,3,,"with no doubt one is able to see some Singapore's landmarks from there, but view not exceptional surprising. A touristy thing.",,,
,,Worth a spin!,5,,"Well worth the ride if you have not experienced the Flyer previously, excellent view of Singapore, the ship parking bays, Skygarden and all the marina area. Good value for money.",,,
,,A must do when in Singapore......flyer ride!!!,5,,We took an evening slot for the flyer which takes about 30 minutes to complete its ride. The looks of glittering Singapore skyline from the top is awesome. It looks like some fairyland. I guess few random pics taken by us say it all. Highly recommended. The ticket cost is 33 SGD per adult pax. Worth it.,,,
,,NICE VIEWS,3,,one of Singapore's landmarks must be visited. the flyer give a nice view over the city and Marina bay.,,,
,,A view to kill for....,5,,"We went during the week, mid morning and there was no lines and we were able to have an entire cab to ourselves! It was an amazing view and worth the money.",,,
,,There are better places to view skyline of Singapore,3,,It's nice to ride this but somehow I found this bit too expensive and with the same amount one can have a better views from Asia bar( top of swissotel hotel) or from the Marina Bay Sands hotel top. Not must to ride place,,,
,,Nothing to shout about,3,,"Been to the London eye, similar to that. However not as scenic as I expected it to me. Well, maybe its just me",,,
,,Awesome place.,5,,I visited Singapore flyer with my wife in the evening and really had a very good time. We really enjoyed a lot. It's a 30 minutes ride and we really enjoyed every minute of it. We also good 6D ride and it's so awesome. Enjoyed a lot.,,,
,,Expensive but good fun.,4,,"You get great views over the area - expensive way of viewing them, but worth doing once for the experience!",,,
,,A must when in Singapore,5,,A must when in Singapore. The cars hold around a dozen people but when we went it was just seven of us friends so plenty of room to move and fantastic views. it takes about a hour to go right round.,,,
,,Costly affair.,3,,"For 30 min's ride need to pay 33SGD/adult, 21 SGD/child If you are in Singapore for a trip it can be recommended , but if you are in Singapore for some time you can skip this, as you are going to see the same view.

Good to see the city from the top but the ticket price of this should be less , or at least they should allow multiple rides.

the wheel moving very slowly. some time it makes you feel its not moving at all.

given avg rating for slow moving and expensive ticket price. its not worth compare to its price.",,,
,,A must place to experiece,5,,"My partner is scared of heights and we spent a bit of time coaxing her to give Flyer a go. We arrived at the site by bus, walked into the entry processed our tickets and we were on our way. We a group of 4 were amazed by the structure and sorounds, we got in the queue and kept talking to my nervous partner. I was wondering how people got on and off, to my suprise the wheel doesn't stop but travels at such a speed that people get on and off with some guidance of assistance from staff. The journey on the wheel is phenomanal the views are fantastic. Not sure how long it took to go all the way around some 20 to 30 minutes I think. My nervous partner was so enthralled she forgot about her fears, after the event she says that is one of the items I can tick off from my bucket list. D&D",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,Fantastic view. Very stable cubicles. Moves very slowly so if you are scared of heights don't worry it is very smooth. Great photo opportunities from every angle,,,
,,Reasonably priced experience,5,,"if you're on a budget, then it's not necessary to go on The Flyer. It's a gentle ride, not crowded in the carriage and if you time it right, you will see the evening draw in and the lights light up during your ride. If you want a view, then go to Gardens by the Bay and pay 5 dollars to walk the sky platform between the 'trees' . You go to the top in a lift and walk the platform. Brilliant views!",,,
,,Just a big wheel,3,,"Took a ride on the flyer as the tickets were included in a deal we had. Would not have paid for it otherwise. It was something to do, but not particularly spectacular and not a patch on the Riesanrad at the Prater in Vienna. Probably would have been better at night but our ticket stipulated that we take the trip before 6.00pm. Luckily we went around 9.45am as the crowds had dramatically increased by the time our circuit was done and the crowds kept increasing throughout the day. Could think of much better things to do, I guess you either like big wheels or don't.",,,
,,"A very big, big wheel",4,,"In some ways it is just a big wheel....but it is really big, and it does give great views over the city and harbour. Worth doing.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Great view. A great experience but a tad expensive at $33. Scenic views of Singapore, Marina Bay Sands and also the set up for the Grand Prix. Very steady cabin so safe experience for all ages. Highly recommended.",,,
,,Elegant and Pretty,5,,It out cast the beauty of the city at night with the wonderful lightings. Very romantic and it is good for couples to have a romantic dinner as it is quite affordable. With the beauty scenery it pays off.,,,
,,Flyer to fly on Singapore,5,,"Singapore Flyer has two different looks in day light & night time. In Day light, its a place like claim & polite. However, in night, it appeared as a gorgeous princess look.. the lighting, lighting of the nearby high raised building, the sea...whole things changed its look time ti time. From down side, you must have a picture with the whole flyer circle. Then you entered into the counter to purchase ticket. There is a photo booth when you entered to ride the flyer. Upon departure, you got the printed photo in a photo frame, each pic cost 20 SGD (packages also there for taking more than 1 pictures). The ride ticket price: 30 SGD/person. It takes ~30 minutes to have a single round. You can enjoy the beauty of Singapore from different side of the flyer. However, there is not sufficient light to take picture from inside. If possible, carry a flash light/torch light to have clear picture.Ticket counter is opened upto 8 pm night. So go there before that to have a ride on Flyer.
There is another type of flyer with dinning facility. A shop is there to buy suvanior, but the shop is a lit bit expensive.
Overall, the time you pass there will be a remarkable time of your life that is for sure.",,,
,,A must when visiting Singapore - worlds biggest ferris wheel,5,,"What a fabulous attraction. Beautiful views over Singapore, you can see all of the cities amazing buildings and is lovely to glide around in air-conditioned comfort. Even for those with fear of heights it is okay, you barely notice you are moving.",,,
,,Flying high,5,,"The Flyer is a wonderful thing to do in Singapore as you get an overview of the city, especially the inner city and the marina side. It goes very slowly so plenty of time to look and explore. Just make sure you go to the toilet as it is 35 minutes long. Going both at day and night is a good idea and if you have time you can do both, however either is good. It moves slowly so not scary at all and the carriages are big enough to not feel claustrophobic. You can move around inside them easily and it is rarely very full.",,,
,,Beautiful view,5,,Great experience. I was unsure on doing this as I am afraid of heights but felt quite safe and was able to thoroughly enjoy the experience. Unfortunately it was a bit misty but views were still amazing. We went in the morning to avoid the queues which was a nice change.,,,
,,Do not miss,4,,"It is one of those attractions you shouldn't miss when you are in Singapore. The tickets can either be purchased online or at the counters in the venue. Avoid going to the flyer during long weekends cuZ it's absolutely crowded. You get very good views of the riverfront, flower dome and Singapore skyline.avoid taking the flyer during late evenings since the reflection from the glass might pose a problem while clicking pictures.",,,
,,Nice view,4,,Nice view over the city. Can closely see the Singapore grand prix praparation sites marina bay ect....,,,
,,Dont Miss Singapore Flyer,5,,"We were confused whether to take a ride on Singapore flyer or not as we had received mixed advice on the same, but we decided to give it a go!!

I am afraid to heights so was anxious when boarding the flyer, but this thing rotates so slowly that we hardly noticed it moving. We took ride in the afternoon and the views from the Top are just Amazing. Earlier we wanted to take a ride after sunset but since we didnot have the time we took it in day. It proved out to be a good decision as we could see all of Singapore and could identify the major landmarks, which I doubt would have been possible at night.

We had a great view and enjoyed the ride thoroughly. Strongly Recommend.",,,
,,just another big wheel,2,,"doesn't really add anything to the Singapore experience. I suppose, if you've been on one big wheel you've been on them all.",,,
,,Awesome view,5,,While my partner was laying on the floor holding onto the seat frozen in fear i thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience the views are awesome and the air con made it very pleasant,,,
,,Expensive but worth a ride,4,,"Excellent part of the vacation, Enjoyed the view of the small country through the flyer. Best part its speed is so correct that you don't get bored and enjoy the ride while watching and taking pictures at ease. Expensive though",,,
,,"Nice, Slow, and Relaxing View of Singapore and Further",5,,"The Singapore Flyer gives you ample time for nice panoramic views of Singapore. Make sure you choose the nicest and clearest day you are in Singapore. If you do, you can see parts of Indonesia on top of the Ferris Wheel. Grab your camera and relax while you ascend and descend to and from the city. Conveniently located near many tourist options, you can easily view the Marina Bay.",,,
,,A great experience,5,,"Such a good experience. Flying high above the city in comfortable air conditioned capsules. Really worth a visit. We were a bit early for the special flights that include cocktails or champagne, so we settle for the regular trip without any frills. A 30 minute ride that enables you to view the city from all angles and take great photographs.",,,
,,Mo毛t Pod,4,,We booked the VIP Mo毛t pod and weren't disappointed. Only two other people in our pod which allowed us great views in relaxing surroundings with champagne and chocolates.,,,
,,Awesome view of Singapore!,5,,"If you want to have a magnificent view of the city.. this is the perfect place to go. Nice, easy ride with stunning views to capture unforgettable pictures of Singapore.",,,
,,"Sunning views on a clear day,",5,,"On a clear day, the views from the flyer are stunning. The place is well run by friendly staff and I personally loved it.",,,
,,Flying on the Flyer,4,,"Loved it. Watched as the Grand Prix track was being setup, great views of the city but sadly smoke from nearby Sumatra gave all the pictures a bit of a hazy look.",,,
,,a part of Singapore at night,4,,The night scene was beautiful with a panoramic view. I particularly used time-lapse photography to make some videos. The gradually changing view of the entire Singapore was really stunningly appealing.,,,
,,Flying High,5,,"No waiting ,very organised,I'm claustrophobic ,but the cars were so big I felt fine,lovely panoramic views of the Bay and City.",,,
,,Fantastic views,4,,An exhilarating ride with outstanding views of the City! Great location and easy access with excellent facilities.,,,
,,Views outstanding!,4,,"I am a person in a wheel chair and I received most excellent assistance, I think signing for the approach could be better, but overall a most enjoyable experience1",,,
,,Don't miss this on your itinerary!,5,,"If you want to see the beauty of Singapore, make sure to include this in your itinerary. You'll definitely see all attractions in Singapore. One of the biggest flyer in the world. It's kinda relaxing to see the views on top. Fantastic!",,,
,,Great views,4,,This is a great thing to do in the day or night. You can see the whole of Singapore. We didn't have a huge line so it was quick to get to.,,,
,,Quite an interesting ride!,5,,"If you go to Singapore I think this is one thing you can't miss! I went in the morning! But I'm sure it's beautiful in the night too! You get to see gardens by the bay in the night and that's just amazing! After all the night view of Sinagpore is truly wonderful! There is an advantage going in the morning .... You get to see the forests and the river! If not they may just look like dark patchs on the surface!
But the experience is good in both way!",,,
,,Fabulous views,5,,"Best to go at night, absolutely fabulous views, you can't beat the lights of Singapore. It is expensive, but you only would go on it once, so worth the money. Didn't have to wait very long in queue.",,,
,,Great Views!,5,,"The Flyer is a great way to see Singapore, we visited at night time and the views were fantastic! It is definitely worth a visit. Looking forward to returning, next time I will visit at daytime just to compare.",,,
,,Wonderful.,5,,"Wonderful. Gives you the most incredible view of Singapore. Loved it... Will do it again... Soon ... Certain cars can also be booked to have a meal I believe ... Whatever way you do it, do it twice. Once during the day perhaps at dawn or dusk and once at night. The Flyer overlooks the 'Gardens in the Bay' where every night at 19:45 and 20:45 there is the most gorgeous light and music display. From memory the display is about 15 minutes but I'd stand corrected. It may be longer. You will not hear the music from the Flyer which is also beautifully lit, but will see the light display from the most incredible vantage point. The Singaporean Government spent a billion dollars I believe building 'Gardens in the Bay' and from the Flyer is amazing.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"I did both the Skypark and Singapore Flyer and out of the two I would say the Skypark offers the best view. If you are not already staying in the Marina Bay Sands so paying for both attractions, I would say you only need to do one or the other.

The Flyer is a popular tourist attraction so expect a queue. Buying tickets was quick but then we had to wait about 40 minutes. The majority of the queue is indoors and they have tried to keep it as interactive as possible to reduce the boredom! The actual ride itself is 30 minutes. The capsules are spacious with a bench in the middle should you not wish to stand up but there's plenty of room to walk around to take in the view from both sides. If you don't have a head for heights and/or get claustrophobic, this isn't for you.",,,
,,Lovely view,5,,"A lovely view could see for miles no line up either, could be a little bit cheaper take your own photo's don't buy too expensive.",,,
,,Good but expensive,4,,Slow but a good ride. A little expensive but its good to watch only once in a life time. but definitely not repeatedly. would be better if it moves at a little faster pace.,,,
,,Love the food court.,3,,"While it is a great addition to the landscape, taking a ride in it requires a lot of patience. If you can sit still and enjoying the view of 30ish minutes then it is for you. If you are not and especially if you have bladder issue, don't. Definitely visit the food court though. I love the decoration and the ambiance there. Food is not exactly cheap here, but that is to be expected with the location. To me, I was on vacation anyway supporting the vendors is not a big deal.",,,
,,Underwhelming!,3,,"I'm afraid the Flyer was much too slow for my liking. The views were certainly spectacular but I'd had enough before we were half way around.
It was the beginning of our holiday, so maybe we hadn't yet got into relaxation mode, but if you choose this Singapore attraction, expect to just chill out for a while and take in the views.",,,
,,Great for Views of SIngapore,5,,"A very comparable experience to the London Eye, but at least here we could walk up without a prior booking. Nice relaxing way to see the city sights",,,
,,Great experience,5,,The Simgapore Flyer is much larger than the London eye. You can have a small lunch or dinner party in each cabin. It takes an hour to go around so it's an excellent value. The views are breathtaking! This is our 2nd time. 2 out of 2 visits.,,,
,,Not that great,3,,"Even though it looks enormous from a distance, the ride in itself is boring. The view is undoubtedly very good. But there are much better options available to get a birds eye view of Singapore City, like the Observation Deck at the Marina Bay Sands! If not opting for any other thing, then this ride can be taken!",,,
,,Family (All Adults),4,,"As a Singaporean it's my 2 visit to the Flyer, brought my sister and mother here to take the ride.
The reason for a 4 out of 5 star is because it's pricey! Paid about S$100 for 3 person.
And the ride lasted for only about half an hour.
View is magnificent and amazingly beautiful at night with a the skyscrapers lighted up.
Worth to visit only once!",,,
,,Excellent sightseeing views,5,,A convenient way to see over Singapore. Centrally located with a reasonable price. Close to transport.,,,
,,Birds eye view of Singapore,5,,A great way to get a birds eye view of Singapore and to appreciate the landscape of reclaimed land. Also saw a floating soccer pitch and the Grand Prix track from the flyer.,,,
,,family trip,5,,"Singapore flyer is a must see place at singapore , when you reach at the top you can see whole of singapore , its advisable to see this place in the evening",,,
,,Incredible experience,3,,"First I want to say is it super entertainment, but short and expensive. Here is the tip: it's cheaper to get the ticket online. And of course if you are in Singapore you can't ignore Sentosa, and being in Sentosa you can't miss IFly.",,,
,,Expensive and only 30 mins ride,3,,"It look more beautiful from outside than from inside. If you are fans of big wheel, you should take a ride. I think the ticket is expensive and it only take 30 mins ride. The view from the top is beautiful, but you only have few mins at the top and very top.
If you not a big fans of big wheel and you want to have a top position for the view of Singapore, would recommend visit the roof top bar of Marina Bay Sand.",,,
,,Great way to see the lay of the land,5,,"I am afraid of heights, and so this was a real challenge for me to do. But I did, and I am glad I did. You see so many landmarks and a great distance, it is a good way to see all of Singapore in a short time! When I did get a bit wobbly, I just sat down and waited for the end, but it wouldn't stop me from doing it again,",,,
,,Beautiful,4,,"Even though we didn't really tried the flyer, but it is still worth to visit. The tickets are quite pricey in my opinion since it is only a 30-min ride.",,,
,,Great views,5,,Really enjoyed the flyer even if it is a bit touristy. Had great views of Singapore and took some great photos.,,,
,,Round and round we go,3,,"We took to the flyer about two or three years ago when the Marina Bay Sands resort was being built.

At that time, there was a lot of construction going on in the area so taking an aerial view was actually quite a good idea. I went with my dad who was 87 at the time and he found the whole experience quite comfortable and interesting.

Dad had been in Singapore during the latter days of WW2 in the Royal Navy. As such, he knows quite a few of the older landmarks. A trip in the Flyer enabled him to pick out several of these such a the old Post Office (now the Fullerton Hotel), The Padang, City Hall and so on. All of these nestle in the re-developed area known as Marina Bay. You get a very good view of the Esplanade Theatre Bay and Gardens by the Bay as well as the already iconic Marina Bay Sands.

A few years ago, there was a breakdown of the flyer which resulted in quite a spectacular 'rescue' with climbers accessing the gondolas from the exterior structure and delivering water to the stranded passengers. It must have been quite stressful at the time. Nothing has happened since to suggest that this was nothing more than an isolated case but I'd hate to have been in the top gondola when everything ground to a halt!",,,
,,Dont waste your money,2,,"Pretty average experience, good view but scungy surrounding where the wheel is located. Should have a commentary...",,,
,,Had an awesome dinner inside the flyer capsule.,5,,"In the dinner inside the capsule.we get 2 rounds for 30 mins each.it costs a lot more than the normal ride which costs around 26-29 dollar.this was around 280 dollar for a couple which included 2 rounds.the normal ticket gives u just one ride.
It was a bit costly but It was our anniversary so we thought it was fine.

Overall a great experience and fun to see Singapore from the top.",,,
,,Great views,4,,Fantastic views of Singapore? The approximately 35 minute 'flight' on the flier allows amazing views of this fantastic city. Great value attraction.,,,
,,Excellent,5,,Excellent place..U can never miss this while visit Singapore..May be the second largest wheel in the world after London Eye..,,,
,,A good outlook for the view and a perspective over the skyline..,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is the London Eye or the Melbourne Star, but located in Singapore. That said, it was still on my to do list and I am glad we managed to tick the box.

We travelled by the MRT and it was a warm but relatively quick 5 minute walk from the MRT to the Flyer. Tickets were bought on the day and it was a pretty quick, painless experience with no queue's.

It took about 30 mins to do the loop and as everyone has highlighted gives some great views over the city.. Whilst I'm glad I've ticked the box, it is a once off and not something I'd do everytime I was in Singapore..

As a side note, we walked over to Marina Bay Sands via the Helix Bridge after the ride.. again it was a 10 min walk that bordered on hot and sweaty for those not taking a taxi to the Flyer..",,,
,,Singapore you did it again!,4,,"Singapore maybe is a small country but it's everything every tourist wants to spend their money on! I've been to Singapore multiple times, each visit just getting more and more impressed! We had fun on last visit to Singapore, we took a ride at Singapore flyer, was a long queue, crowded and little expensive BUT definitely worth it. We could see more of Singapore from above.",,,
,,General,5,,It one of reare and beautiful thing to enjoy .we can see the beautiful city singapore's road flyover buildings and sea from the top it is enjoyable specially for Children's . It is remembering memory Ravindra Gudu,,,
,,From above,5,,A bit pricey but well worth the money you can barely fell you are moving. Some fantastic views of Singapore and the surrounding districts. One off my must doe's in Singapore.,,,
,,""" A Flop""",3,,"We were expecting to feel like we are high in the sky overlooking the entire city instead it stopped halfway with average view . Save yourself $ 31 dollars per adult and go to MArina BAy Sands where it costs 23 dollars for non guests not sure exactly which part of the hotel and you will see a spectacular view ,as I was staying there.",,,
,,A little slow,3,,Wish it would turn a little faster. Viewing 360 degrees around without blockade was good enough. Wish I could control the speed of the motion.,,,
,,Flyer was fun,3,,Flyer was fun but very expensive and I probably wouldn't do it again. I recommend it because of the views though.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"Not long to buy a ticket, although the facilities were there for a long queue. It takes about 30 minutes to go round, the views are very good and each compartment provides seating for everyone in it. Great views of the F1 pit lane, the cbd and the ships waiting to enter the harbour.",,,
,,A Truly Moving Experience..!!,4,,This is a must see attraction in Singapore. There is not too much to see at the Journey of Dreams which is part of the flight. The flight is the best part and the views from the top are truly amazing. Just keep your fingers crossed for clear weather.,,,
,,Magificent views,5,,"My first experience on the Singapore flyer was in 2009. Here again on holiday and it is still a highlight for visitors. Take a 30 minute journey and see magnificent panoramic views of Singapore and beyond to Malaysia and Indonesia. The capsules which are are climate controlled, provide a comfortable viewing point to see many of Singapore's historic landmarks. Take the MRT. It is only a few minutes walk from Promenade.
A must visit while in Singapore.",,,
,,Wow! What a view!,4,,It is best to ride the flyer at night. The lights around the marina is breathtaking. Worth the money and time.,,,
,,Have a nice fly.,4,,"It is absolutely the Asian version of London Eye. Although the common outlooking of the cabins, you got perfect view from the car. Marina Bay and Sands are so charming from the view of Singapore Flyer.",,,
,,Good views,4,,Good views of the city at a relaxed pace. The views from Marina Bay Sands observation deck are better though.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"I was impressed with the views, cleanliness and comfort of the Singapore flyer. It was easy to get to via the singapore red tour bus. We travelled with our 5 month old and were pleased to see breastfeeding facilities at the centre, although it would have been nice if there were a few more as we did have to wait to use it.",,,
,,Visitor,5,,A great experience though a bit scary. Fantastic view a the top. Thought the tickets were a bit overpriced though,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"Like in other cities around the world, this giant wheel is nothing new but good to experience the amazing views of the Singapore city, especially in the night. Great for photo ops.",,,
,,Highest in the World,3,,"Surprisingly, the Singapore Flyer is the tallest observation wheel in the World. So if you have a list of things to check off; such as riding the tallest wheel in the World; this is a must-do.
Couldn't help but compare the experience with the London Eye. The wait time for the Flyer was almost non-existent - about 5 minutes! Whereas, we waited about an hour for the Eye.
Capsule interior was bare for the Flyer. There was plenty to see and do in the capsule of the Eye, with interactive screens.
The main difference is what you're seeing. With the Eye, you're looking down on a city with hundreds of years of history. The Flyer looks over a city which has just turned 50.
Can't hold anything against a city because of its' age - full credit to Singapore for building this great structure. I can however critique this attraction, and say, that it's a little boring.",,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"I bought Singapore Explorer Pass thru Silk Air at SSD 46 that I could enter several places of attraction. And, one of them is Singapore Flyer. The ride was fantastic and enjoyable. Timing was perfect that it was not too boring (approx. 30 minutes). I would come back again!",,,
,,Absolutely Beautiful,5,,"Singapore Flyer is a must if you are visiting. I went at night time with my boyfriend and it is absolutely beautiful. It is a 30mins sightseeing ride and this ferris wheel changes colour from red, to blue to green to yellow and so on. And when you are up and going around the night view of Singapore is so incredible!! Highly recommend.",,,
,,Do it,4,,"I think this is a must do when in Singapore. Beautiful views all around and nice time just to relax. The downside, like most things in Singapore, it expensive. About $30 per person.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Don't miss this. The view is amazing and like all of Singapore's attractions it is run like clockwork.,,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,The views from this attraction are brilliant. Very comfortable and safe capsules. It would be nice though if it took just a little longer than 30 minutes.,,,
,,best in the evening,5,,My family and I did the flyer in the early evening and so it was dark by the time our ride ended. The views and lights were magnificent from every angle. Well worth a visit.,,,
,,Great view...,5,,"The ride itself is breathtaking... The view from above is nothing to compare to... Must visit at night, because it has the best view of Singapore at night... Better to buy the tickets online or in the morning to avoid queues...",,,
,,Expensive for a family,4,,"Was expensive to take the family on the 30 minute ride however would recommend that you take the ride at night as the views were spectacular. Disappointing that there was no commentary pointing out places of interest. Also, they had ran out of the english brochures that may have assisted in this regard.",,,
,,Nice views,4,,"Must visit at least once. You get to see very nice views during this 30 min ride. As it rotates very slowly, anyone can enjoy it without any fear.",,,
,,Nice view...,4,,"Great view of the city but unfortunately I wish I'd had the time for a disk/ night ride as it was hazy. The ride itself was smooth and comfortable, however extremely overpriced.",,,
,,Great view of Singapore,4,,Relaxing and comfortable way to see all the sites of Singapore from the sky. My husband took lots of amazing photos in it. Definitely well worth it.,,,
,,Good one - depends on time you select,4,,"I was lucky to board just a moment before sunset. So, i experienced good view of sun set and then nice lights of Gardens by the Bay... Good view of the city... By visiting this, you can plan to skip the Sky Park (costs @ S$23 per person) for the same view offered.",,,
,,A must do while in Singapore.,5,,A good overview of the city and environs. Pods were spacious and not overcrowded. Speed of the circle allows time for photos from all angles,,,
,,Come on Board Everyone,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is not just a big Ferris Wheel with great views.
Even before you get to the Flyer, your flying experience begins in the only way Singapore knows how to do - making you have a sensory overload experience.
To begin with you must go through a ""pretend customs"" experience to get to the flyer, starting off with getting your tickets at the ticket booth - if you have not already pre-booked them (highly recommend to pre book as queues can be long).
Once you have your tickets you go through a baggage check area and follow the tunnel which is covered with facts and figures and art until you get to the flight deck where you come across more interesting facts and figures and art.
When you finally get onto the flyer, you will enjoy a nice slow ride taking in some spectacular views - even on cloudy, overcast days.
Yes the ride is a bit pricey but show me something in Singapore that is not?
When the ride is over, you can continue to explore the centre the flyer is in and get some great Asian food or freshly made juices and smoothies at the food hall and surrounding shops.",,,
,,Not to be missed,4,,Great and comfortable. An appeasing visit where you can sit and enjoy a very nice view on the singapore skyline. Highly recommended. Even better at night.,,,
,,SINGAPORE FLYER A MUST RIDE,5,,The ride in the Singapore Flyer was amazing.......... The views were so beautiful that wanted to take again and again........ You must not miss it....,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,Nice views and slow ride. Abit pricey but thats things are in a city like spore. I advice to go in the evening than in the hot afternoon.,,,
,,Fly on the Flyer,5,,"You will need a couple of hours to take the Singapore Flyer, if you have not pre-booked. You get good discounts on Flyer ticket value if you purchase early and along with other bus trip packages. Check out the deals/offers available at the hotel you stay.",,,
,,Great view on Singapore,5,,"For a great view on Singapore - this is a place to be.
Its a bit on a pricey side, like everything in Singapore, but very much worth it for the views.
I suggest not buying the ticket in advance as the weather can be unpredictable in Singapore, and you would surely want your views not be obstructed by rain or fog.
If there's a line, it moves quite fast, they are doing a great job moving ppl in and out of the pods fast enough.
There's also a chance to have your pic done against the green screen which they later change into a perfect view of Singapore. Be creative, there are some nice expamples of what other ppl came up with! I admit we always skip such pics, but this time it actually turned out nice, so we bought it.
The Flyer itself is a 10 min walk from Promenade MRT station as it is also an end point to the Hop on Hop off buses. There's a small foodcourt with it, so you won't stay hungry.
All in all, a must see in Singapore!",,,
,,Good for a romantic dinner,4,,The view from the flier is exceptional. Great place for a romantic dinner. Book in advance though. Kids may get a bit bored.,,,
,,Great Views - take a map though,4,,"At $33 it's a bit expensive, but we were lucky and shared a cabin with only one other couple on a Sunday morning at about 10 am. The views are great although there is no way of orienting yourself if you're not familiar with Singapore's downtown district. Luckily we had a map, which we found really great to check out the interesting sites we could see.",,,
,,Awesome experience,4,,Awesome. Please visit at night. This is a perfect get away for a few hours. Gives a breathtaking view if the city.,,,
,,Amazing view,4,,"Good experience, best place to see most of Singapore in one go. I went during a weekend in peak season and the line was long, but it was worth the wait. If you have done everything Singapore have to offer take a trip on the Flyer it is worth it.",,,
,,Awesome view of Singapore!,3,,Gives you a great view of Singapore. Would recommend to go during the evening. Tickets are pretty pricey and you are sharing a space with other people unless you pay for a private one thats ridiculously expensive.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,It's a good recreational friends place. You can have a wonderful view of Singapore by sitting in Singapore Flyer. Also have your group photo done. A wonderful dine in experience while in the air.,,,
,,"""Wow!""",5,,"One of the best flyer so far! I felt comfortable. My knees does not tremble hahah.. its just that,its amazing experience!",,,
,,Great view and great show!,4,,"Visited the Singapore Flyer as part of a whistle stop visit to Singapore. I opted to take the Singapore Sling Flyer visit, which meant that the we completed the flight in themed capsule and were given a world famous Singapore Sling.

There were no queues that late in the evening, it was 9:30 pm flight, so we were taken straight up through the VIP lounge to the Flyer where we were given our drinks and boarded the themed capsule.

The themed capsule was a ittle more jazzed up than the usual and had music playing to give a part feel. The view from the capsule are fantastic, you get a 360 view of the Singapore skyline, from the Supergrove trees of the Botanical gardens to the sky scrapers. At night it's a little difficult to take photos because the glare from the lights inside of the capsule, but it's a good chance to just enjoy the view.

Not too expensive and gives you a great view of Singapore. Would make a trip if you can.",,,
,,What an amazing view of the city,5,,The best location if you want to see the whole city which is so very beautifully designed and architecture of the city is amazing,,,
,,Weeeeeeeeeee,5,,"I went at sunset and it was great. 33 bucks which is harsh but whatever, great views and you are on a space ferris wheel.",,,
,,A must to do in Singapore.,5,,"We were advised to go at night as there would be less people and the lights would be terrific, it was good advice as we walked straight on and the lights were unbelievable.",,,
,,Very impressive show,5,,"Very impressive show. The best time, I suppose, between day and evening, so you can see the city in daylight and with night illumination. It takes 30 minutes. On the ground floor - small beatiful park and excellent restaurant",,,
,,Perfect view,4,,"You can see most adorably places of Singapore from this attraction - a gulf, skyscrapers etc. In the evening time here are a flood of light, and you can see a light-show in closely located Gardens by the Bay.",,,
,,Amazing areal view at night,5,,What takes your breath away is amazing view of Singapore at night. This is one of the the biggest in the world. The entire experience was pretty cool!,,,
,,Flyer has its own fun.,5,,"Flyer has its own fun.
I went there with my friends and this was really cool not in terms of weather but amazed... beautiful, fun place, people scared of heights should not try this...
It was really hot and humid as we know Singapore weather is like that so don't expect that it will change.. overall good ride and had fun.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,"Absolutely fantastic, you can see the whole of the city which is lovely. Well worth the money. Very good.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer!,5,,"Singapore Flyer at dusk, is probably the best time to get on as you see all the lights around the city and the super trees at gardens by the bay. Similar to London Eye",,,
,,Flyer is not working,1,,"The flyer is close, when we want to try it .It seems get out of order. But in the evening is the flyer decorated with wonderful lights",,,
,,Nice view,4,,"This Marina area is nice and fine. Again place is clean and lot of to see. Form that Flyer area You can get city tour or DuckTour (on land and sea). DuckTour are popular and it is nice if You are whit child and it is different way to see / look city.
I was whit little child in there but I belive it is worh seeing in night lighting, like on post card. From the Flyer in up You can get good look about Singapore.
A lots of missed seeing, so have to come back again",,,
,,Worth doing for a bird's eye view of the city and coastal area.,4,,"As ferris wheels go, the Flyer is among the best in the world and certainly one of the highest. Conveniently located for visitors staying in hotels near the famous Raffles Hotel.",,,
,,Views Forever,5,,"Magnificent 360 deg vistas of Singapore - smooth, slow, constant movement, even quite okay for those nervous of heights, but does have seats in centre of each carriage if you want them.",,,
,,hot and sticky worse than being outside,3,,just another giant Ferris wheel lines were very long and cabin was very hot making the whole experience unpleasent,,,
,,"The Big Wheel 鈥?Silent, air conditioned flight with magnificent sights",5,,"We booked our flight on the biggest wheel in the southern hemisphere online. One of drawbacks of this method is that you need to pick up tickets from the visitors centre in Chinatown. Not a hassle for us as we were heading in that vicinity regardless. After arriving at the Flyer site and handing in our tickets we found that making our way to the actual departure point was a little like walking through a maze. Beware the photographer lurking in the depths who will pop out and enquire whether you would like your photograph taken. We politely declined and made our way to where we were assisted to board our cabin. We had arrived early in the day and as a result there were only four people sharing the cabin space. After setting off one realises that everything is very quiet and also very comfortable and most importantly, not scary at all. As the flight continues you can see great panoramic views of Singapore and obviously there are fantastic photo opportunities. So be sure to take your camera with you. The whole flight takes about 30 minutes and is a wonderful experience. It is definitely one we would repeat.",,,
,,A different view,3,,Great views of Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay but that's really all. The kids really wanted to go on it but got bored in about 5 mins. Could have easily given it a miss.,,,
,,Nice Views,5,,We did the Flyer as darkness fell which I think is the best time. The view of Singapore lit up is awesome.,,,
,,Not worth for money,2,,I personally think that it is not worth for money due to its high cost of a ride with just around less than 30 mins. Furthermore the view is not as good as taking the boat ride from Clark Quey. I believe that traveller don't mind to give a try if the price could be reduced.,,,
,,Nice views of the city but overpriced!,3,,Nice views of the city but overpriced for the ride. Save the money - go to MBS and order a drink a Ce La Vie -- you'll get a better view and a drink!,,,
,,Birds Eye View,5,,Well worth a visit as it helps one get their bearings. The view from the capsules are wonderful. make it a morning when there are no crowds.,,,
,,Well worth it.,5,,Really enjoyed the views! Staff had everything running smoothly. It was a bit wet and overcast and still thought it was worth while. Must be glorious on a clear day!,,,
,,Fabulous city views from the top of the Flyer,5,,"The Singapore Flyer was one of the stops on the Hop On Hop Off Bus Tour. We decided to go and see for ourselves as it is one of the largest observation wheels in the world outside of the USA! We purchased our tickets from the kiosk at the base of the wheel and then had to go up to get to the wheel itself. There was an informative area as you walked through giving you the facts and figures and other information about this and other observation wheels. We then queued and wait for our capsule to arrive and then entered whilst it continued to slowly move - there was no problem on getting on! The wheel travelled slowly and smoothly around. There was a seating area in the middle and also a 360 degree view all around. You could walk around in the capsule and get a really amazing view of the city of Singapore, fabulous view of the bay and an amazing view of Gardens on the Bay. The whole journey takes about 30 minutes and is well worth doing!",,,
,,Visit it once in a life time,4,,Just got to see everything. very nice for f1 sea building marina bay good for photos go in the morning,,,
,,"Nice aesthetics, but gets boring after first 10 mins.",3,,"This ride takes about 40 mins from start to end, not including queuing times. The novelty of this ride wears off after the first ten minutes, and then the excitement builds up again when you are the top. After that, you kinda get impatient for the ride to end. That's what I felt anyway.

Perhaps for a tourist, it might be a lot more interesting as us Singaporeans are pretty used to the skyline already. At that height, you will be able to get great panaromic views of our little island, and will have nice pictures to bring home. There is also a souvenir shop at the end of the ride so you can get some goodies over there.",,,
,,Awesome wheel and safest one.,3,,"One of the biggest fly wheel i ever seen, with a closed box, slow moving with no jerk. You wont feel the fear when it moves at high altitude. Safest one. Enjoyable fly wheel for kids as well as for aged people.",,,
,,Singapore overview,5,,This is an excellent place for a Singapore overview. Our kids loved it. It even has excellent priced meals in the shopping centre below.,,,
,,"Not Scary as I Expected, Enjoyable Ride and Views",4,,"Not a big ferris wheel fan especially with a small two seater that swings. This was a very enjoyable and scenic ride. It moves at a snail's pace and the 30 minute ride passes by quickly. There is a little single bench to sit on for each pod whereas some pods must be premium offerings with a nicer layout (looked like a dinner table with seats). Location is conveniently near the Mandarin Oriental, Ritz Carlton and Sands.

We went during the day. I would suggest riding at nighttime as the views I am sure are even more spectacular.",,,
,,Super views,5,,"A great experience and a 'must see' for any tourist. We chose a particularly clear day, and went in the afternoon. It's the best view of Marina Bay and the city you can get.

My 94 year-old father-in-law came with us. He is a Singaporean, but had never experienced the flyer. The staff were particularly helpful, as we had a wheelchair with us. The helped us on and off, even slowing the wheel down slightly.

The price is reasonable. Choose a very clear day to get the best views, or go around dusk as the city lights are coming on.",,,
,,Memorable Rides,5,,This ride is a good way to see Singapore from high altitude. You will be able to get 360 degree view of Singapore. The ride itself is very smooth.,,,
,,Biggest Ferris wheel on the planet...,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is larger than the London Eye and any other Ferris wheel on the planet. The tickets aren't too pricey, the views are breathtaking and the experience is unforgettable. The Singapore Flyer is truly and attraction every tourist who comes to Singapore must visit.",,,
,,Bird's eye view,4,,lovely view from the Flyer. Catch it around evening time. We could see the Harbour and the Commercial center. Since it was dusk when the lights came on it was just superb.,,,
,,Views amazing but got a little bored towards the end,4,,"Views amazing but got a little bored towards the end as id seen it and taken my photos and I was ready to move on. Me and my husband were lucky and managed to get a pod to ourselves. You can see everything and also where they are extending the shoreline no double to expand Singapore further. Glad I went and I went in the day also, I think if you went at night that would also be amazing.",,,
,,Pleasant and knowledgeable with great views,4,,"This was a great opportunity to get a fantastic view of the whole area, with running commentary about all of the main landmarks, explaining the landmarks and why they were built in the position/direction in relation to positive energy etc.
Helped with knowledge of the area as well as the various local beliefs.
The Flyer was well managed, clean and very informative. Would definitely recommend.",,,
,,Not my cup of tea but you know what I loved it.,5,,great place to relax and to view on a clear day Singapore Remember to book before getting their. You can select a time also if not booked. You can do other thing while waiting for your turn. By the way it is air conditioned...,,,
,,Family outing,4,,Relaxing place to be with the kids.. Bring scooter along so kids can slide n play there..very windy & nice scenery. Love coming here..,,,
,,Flyer 's to remember,5,,"Were been bvisiting Singapore Flyer's since it was known for being nice place in Singapore.Moreso,at this place you can find the travel and tour that was handling our booking for Legoland Malaysia with family and friends.",,,
,,Colourful,5,,It was a great sight as we visited the place in the night.The whole city is bright and colorful at night especially with all the lights on the many skyscrapers come on in the night.,,,
,,Great place to spend one evening,4,,"The flyer offers one of the best views of the city. At the top you can have a breath taking view of the harbor, the Business districts and F1 circuit.You can also have a lovely dinner on the flyer. A must experience when you visit Singapore. In the flyer compound there is an Ice cream parlor. Visit the same and have Tiramisu Ice cream you will love it.",,,
,,Not bad! BUY your tickets in advance and avoid the lines!,4,,"The view is amazing, to be honest, but when we went there it was crowded (around 5pm). Too many people wanting to take photos during golden hour. The good thing is that we bought our tickets one day before through Klook Travel, which ended up being a great decision because we didn't have to wait in line to buy a ticket. It's nice to be able to take panoramic photos of the city... let me rephrase it, it would be nice to be able to do that, unfortunately there were too many people to take proper photos without anyone photobombing. Overall, not a bad place to spend an afternoon.",,,
,,Skip if been to London Eye,4,,"I have already been to London eye so felt it had better view as compared to Singapore Flyer. Otherwise,it was worth a visit.",,,
,,The Singapore Flyer is definitely worth a possible bout of vertigo. Awesome.!,5,,"Even if you are scared of heights, this would still be a wonderful part of any trip to Singapore. You will get a Birdseye view of the city and all the places you've already visited plus all of the places you want to visit. The flyer moves at a very gentle pace allowing one to board and alight without needing to hurry. I saw a quite frail couple in their late 70s who had no trouble at all. I encourage everyone to try one of the crazy but wonderful fruit drinks sold at the shop situated just under the stairs leading up to the entrance of the flyer. The drinks seem to grow fruity bits which is probably why the straw is twice the diameter of a normal straw.",,,
,,Just to get it done and over with,3,,"A business associate was visiting and since he was visiting with his family, he suggested taking a ride on the flyer. Seriously I was not impressed although the cabins were huge and comfortably air conditioned.",,,
,,Too Costly for what you get,3,,I felt it is too costly for a flyer. Since it is one the most expensive city in the world we can't do anything. But yes it looks good at night to watch everything in a short duration from the flyer. It costs me around 33 SGD,,,
,,Good Place to have an Ariel view if you dont have to visit other attractions,3,,The Flyer looks attractive from a distance and is a good choice for Ariel view. But it is quite expensive - around 30 sgd while you can enjoy the same views from other locations like Tiger Sky Tower or 1-Altitude which are also excellent entertainment places.,,,
,,Can get great pictures,4,,Its allows for some great views of Singapore. We did the flyer at sunset and it was the best decision. You see the Singapore Skyline during the day and at night.,,,
,,Amazing view of Singapore and beyond,5,,We have been here twice; once on the Flyer itself and the second time to a buffet at the Indian restaurant. We went on the flyer in the late afternoon and had finger food buffet and drinks. The only downside was that it went very quickly and the half an hour seemed to go by like a breeze. The buffet at the Indian restaurant was quite nice too. The view of the flyer from the bottom and the surroundings like MBS were very good.,,,
,,Beautiful Views,4,,"Ride it in the day and again at night to see 2 beautiful views of Singapore. My toddler loved it and wanted to take the ride again.
There is lots of food places at the ground floor. Want a very nice picture of you, the Supertrees, the Marina Bay Sands and the ArtScience Museum? Step out to the walk way beside the waters you have the perfect photo.",,,
,,"Safe, cool ride in flyer",5,,"Great views of the city, downtown. Very clean, efficient and cool inside. There were no lines or wait times around noon on the day I visited. Will try for a sundown ride next time.",,,
,,Superb!,5,,"Worth for money, singapore city from above, nice viewing, near to esplanade-merlion statue-marina bay sands.",,,
,,Probably among the best,5,,"Ferris wheel, merry go round all imply the same.. It gives you the sense of empty yet this wife uplifting experience that engulfs you like an eagle catching its prey by it talons. With the exception of you being in an enclosed piece of metal. Views are great, as far as ones eyes can venture and not being cloudy. As soon as it starts you find yourself being at ground level. An experience not to be missed",,,
,,Great experience,5,,"Loved going up the side of this mountain in a cable car, very expensive but worth it and yu can hop off go shopping in the huge arcade at the top then catch it back down when your done.",,,
,,The Best Flyer(or Gigantic Ferris Wheel!),5,,"It was a very good flyer indeed ! (Though it looks like a Ferris Wheel from far). It is very modern, makes no vibration, and the best of all, it gives you an undisturbed bird's-eye view of the whole beauty of Singapore. It is fully glass-made, so you get a spectacular view of everything that's there without problems. Going to Singapore and not going there is like going to Italy and not eating Pizza! However, you may get bored after spending too much time there. 45mins-1hour is acceptable, but I advise all of you to not stay there for more than that.",,,
,,bird eye view from the flyer,5,,"Flyer gives you an amazing feeling . Plan your trip and get the gatepass from the travel agent otherwise you might have to stay in long queues. The local agents give you a pass which valid for 3 months so the pass is not issued for that day. In case if you want to prepone or postpone the planned itinery you can always do that but stick to your schedule so that you get to see all the places .

To e duration shall approximately 2 hrs on a working day during daytime. Go in the flyer during day time as you get to see all the places , a birds eye view of football ground, the garden of bay, the Singapore F1 race track, and all others . Since the flyer is having a AC you don't have to worry if you go at noon also

And don't forget to take a photo and collect it after you complete the flyer . It might be costly but worth the photo for $S 25",,,
,,28!,4,,28 capsules for 28 passengers per capsule rotating in 28 minutes. Did someone plan this?! Fantastic views and reasonable price. It would be nice if they cleaned the glass between passengers though!,,,
,,Typical touristy thing to do at the racetrack,4,,If you will be on top of the Marina Bay Hotel then you can leave that one out. Otherwise it gives you a really nice view from onto the city.,,,
,,Gorgeous views,5,,Had an evening 'flight' on this Flyer. Gorgeous view of the city lights. There was also options to dine or have drinks on one of the special pods. Lots of photo opportunities of this beautiful city.,,,
,,Birds eye view,4,,"This flyer gives you good views of Singapore for miles around. Lasting around 30 minutes we don't even realize the moment so is safe even for those with a fear of heights. I visited during day time and there was not much of a line. At such times they ensure that every family has their individual pod so that privacy is maintained..that's one good thing i liked about Singapore. Most of the attractions staff try to ensure that visitors have the best experience, generally very helpful.",,,
,,"Up,up and away!",4,,Very enjoyable and not as scary as I imagined it would be. Moves slowly and you can just relax and enjoy the view.,,,
,,Not the only place to get a great view in Singapore but one of them.,4,,A fun way to see Singapore City. It takes about 40 minutes to ride the flyer and the views of the City are lovely. The cost is around S$30 and we didn't have to book in advance or wait long to get onboard. Many of our locals friends had not been on this as they felt that there are many places in the City where you can get just as great views.,,,
,,A must!,5,,"If you are visiting Singapore you must make time to go on the flyer!

Fantastic views of the city and the bay. They were setting up for the formula 1 weekend when we visited, so we had great views of the track and starting blocks.

(Date of visit September 2013)",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Awesome views from up the top, especially on a clear day. A nice way to escape the heat as well as the pods are air-conditioned. A nice calm way to take in the whole of Singapore's skyline.",,,
,,Relaxing way to view the sights,4,,"We wandered past the Singapore Flyer expecting it to be super busy ... But were surprised - we pretty much got straight on.

It is a lovely gently 30 minute cycle which takes you to the top of the world. Although the day was overcast, we still had great views for miles.

They do evening meals ... Would be worth looking into, but I don't know anything about cost etc",,,
,,Stunning view,4,,Visit here at night they have great view and it was a relaxing ride not really scary at all. After the ride you can eat at the hawker stands under the flyer,,,
,,Great view,4,,Slow moving but a great view. We happened to be on there just as some of the airforce planes were making a fly by as part of the Independance Day celebrations. Spectacular!,,,
,,Magical scenery of Singapore,5,,"I took an evening ride with my family, the capsules were very spacious and comfortable, the views of Singapore were magical at night so we didn't feel the time as it passed very quickly.. I highly recommend this attraction to be # 1 in Singapore",,,
,,Lovely at night,4,,Lovely and a great view a night. At 20.30 there were now waiting time. A bit expensive but worth it for thie view,,,
,,Must,4,,Recommended if you want to see Singapur's beauty. Mandatory at night. Expensive. Very long expecting time.,,,
,,Amazing View of City,4,,"Like London Eye, Singapore Flyer gives an amazing panoramic view of the city. It is a must visit as it gives you aerial view of entire city and has some amazingly breathtaking views and bay area and sea.",,,
,,Do not miss it,5,,"Such a wonderful experience, I used to see Singapore flyer for any touristic ad about Singapore, but the experience itself is something really different, in short if you will go to Singapore go for it",,,
,,"Good, but not that special.",3,,"It's fun to get a good view of Singapore from the air, and the cars you ride in are new, safe, and pleasant to walk around in. Other than that, it's optional. My 7-year old was excited to get on, excited when it started turning, then the novelty wore off quickly. There is nothing wrong with the Flyer, but there are so many other unique and interesting things to do in Singapore; this is a good one to skip if you're short on time.",,,
,,a must ride!! wonderful experiance.,5,,this is a must place if you are visiting singapore.a very awesome view from the capsule.feels like you are on top of the world.,,,
,,good!,5,,Perfect view at night time! Have to visit it and see wonderful view on Singapore center. good location,,,
,,This may not be for you,3,,"To be absolutely honest, this is not one of the best ""Flyers"" I have travelled on. You could get a better view from the Marina Sands Hotel",,,
,,Identify many of Singapore,4,,"This is not the most popular tourist attraction, but it does ensure that the lines are not very long. The flyer gives wonderful views in all directions. I appreciated that I was with a local, who could point out all the interesting sites to me.",,,
,,4 Course dining experience on Flyer - lovely experience,4,,"Booked a VIP Package of dinner including 2 rotations, ended up in a private pod, treated like VIPs and escorted on with no queing. Lovely experience, lovely views and definitely worth doing.",,,
,,Huge disappointment,3,,"This was one of the biggest disappointments of all in Singapore. It wasnt crowded at all and the area looked kind of dead. I didnt love the view as much as i hoped. It's not bad, not bad at all, but it was just a huge disappointment for me",,,
,,FABULOUS WAY TO SEE THE CITY,5,,"The Flyer is well worth going on. Once you are at the top, you have the most amazing view of the entire city plus the surrounding sea with thousands of container ships etc, quite a sight!",,,
,,Great experience,5,,"Other reviews have said that this is expensive, but I thought that $30 was quite reasonable for the trip.
The wheel turns slowly enough for you to get some great views and photos over downtown Singapore and Gardens by the Bay. If you had small children, they might be a bit bored and restless part way through, but as adults, we loved it.
You do get a similar view on the Marina Bay Sands observation deck, so if you're looking to save money, perhaps pick one or the other",,,
,,Singapore Flyer...a must see,5,,"This is a must see place in Singapore. You get to see a full aerial view of Singapore. It moves slowly and takes approximately 30 minutes to complete a ride. Since we were 3 families, we got the whole Cubicle which made the experience more enjoyable. During adverse weather conditions (rain/lightning) the flyer ride is stopped.",,,
,,very nice,5,,"we did this attraction easy to acces and if you donot go early , you may stay in the line a quite long time, however, beautiful sight seeing when you reach the top and it is not moving very fast , it is beautiful",,,
,,"Spectacular views, well worth the money",5,,"Choose a clear day for some spectacular views over Supertree Grove, Marina Bay, Singapore River and the Formula 1 circuit.",,,
,,Great view!,5,,"A must visit if you are in Singapore. Choose to visit in the evening, the view i stunning. Perfect speed and view to take pictures. A tip, hold your camera/ phone close to the glass so you dont get reflections (like i did)",,,
,,A great view of singapore,4,,We went on the Flyer on our last day to farewell Singapore and get a final view of it's beautiful bay. Its enjoyable and the kids loved it. The views from the top are amazing and the amount of time taken to do a loop is good (about 1/2 hour). A great way to say goodbye.,,,
,,One time is enough,2,,So slow!! Great view but at some point you are just fed up! Very expensive though!!! Sometimes you can have very noisy neighbours! Not value for money,,,
,,Super Flyer..must visit in Singapore,5,,"Amazing view of the whole of singapore...it runs for about 20 minutes to cover one full round..but at the top most position, you can literally see complete Singapore",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,4,,"First we were planing to take the hop on hop off bus tour, but the route was too long so we decided to do the Flyer. Yes, it is expensive, but this is Singapore where everything is expensive. You get a great sense of Singapore and the photos are amazing.",,,
,,Nice ride to catch a lovely view but overpriced,3,,"Spent around half an hour to ride in the flyer with the family. You would get magnificent views of the city but I think it's just overpriced. It may be quite romantic for couples but for such price, you could already spend a fun day either at the Singapore Zoo and get to see so much stuff, or have a lovely walk at the Gardens by the Bay or add a few dollars and have a fantastic time at Adventure Cove Sentosa.",,,
,,Beautiful place to go!,5,,Went for a quick visit while we were waiting for our second flights. Very clean and nice people I personally love Singapore! Go and check once out if you have time.,,,
,,Great views,5,,Great way to view Singapore with fabulous views. No queues and the pods were empty. We did it during the day and had a great time. Would be good to have a map/guide to know what you were looking at. Recommend it!!,,,
,,Stunning views.. Loved it,5,,"I visited on 2nd August. The views from Flyer was stunning. For me, Seaport and city views are fantastic. Have photographs in the flyer. Want to see it again in night..",,,
,,30-minute ride with views of Singapore!,5,,"There are a total of 28 capsules that take you on a 30-minute ride to 360 degree views of Singapore. You can purchase tickets just for the ride, or, for special occasions, you can select a ride with drinks where a wait staff will serve you in a separate capsule. Great view of the Bay, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, and other surrounding areas.

Best time to board is around sunset where you get to see part of the day and night view of Singapore. And, it's best to take a seat facing the back of the wheel as that's where the nicest scenery is at. Though don't be surprised to end up standing as you head towards the top where the view gets breathtaking.",,,
,,Best to Go at Night!,4,,"Minimal queue and gives a great 360 view of the city! The rooms leading to the cart itself were very informative and entertaining. Carts were clean, especially the glass so you can take good pictures of the view. Ride took, around 20 mins or more.

It's best to go at night to have a better view. There's enough city lights to take a clean picture with minimal noise. :) Unless of course, you prefer to do it in the morning.",,,
,,"Great views, great photo opportunities.",5,,"We were fortunate in that our airline provided us with stopover vouchers which gave us free admission to a number of Singapore attractions including the Flyer.
When we arrived during mid-afternoon there were not many people in the vicinity of the big wheel.
After we obtained our tickets by showing our vouchers at a small tourism office, we made our way up to the boarding area for the pods. There were only a few people ahead of us in the queue and they were ushered on-board the first pod to arrive at the boarding platform. When the next pod arrived, we were the only two people left in the queue which meant that we had the entire pod to ourselves. This enabled us to move at will around the pod without having to worry about getting in the way of other people or having our view blocked by others.
We thoroughly enjoyed the 30 minutes that the wheel took to complete its full rotation. There were plenty of great views of many parts of Singapore and the waters around Singapore. There was also plenty of time and plenty of opportunities to take some great photographs.
Recommended as a great way to get some unique views of Singapore.",,,
,,Romantic,4,,"Visited there last September during Formula 1 and it was a very unique experience. In the flyer, you can see almost the whole Singapore and part of Malaysia which is quite amazing. If I remember correctly, you can dine in the flyer.How romantic it is !!

The flyer was good however they tried to charge too much for the pics they took for us which is no good and of course we didn't get them.

For better experience , I recommend you to go during night since the flyer lights can change colors all and it is really beautiful.",,,
,,Stunning views,4,,"Very similar to the London Eye, the Singapore flyer has excellent views of Singapore and is well worth a visit.",,,
,,Lovely way to see the city,4,,"We arrived here from the airport on a day trip and were surprised at the lack of visitors. There was no queue and we hopped on board a ""pod"" with two other people, making it only four of us in total. The trip takes about 35 minutes and you get a wonderful view of the city and surrounds. It is a good spot to get your bearings and work out where you want to go next!
Surprised at the lack of people around. There are food and drink opportunities underneath where the ticket station is if you need them.",,,
,,Nothing to write home about.,4,,"Visited the Flyer at night, had to wait for about 3/4 hr to actually get onto the flyer, ticket box and queuing held us up. Very slow, don't seem as if you are moving, but nice views of Marina Bay night skyline. Entry fee $33.00 singapore dollars for around 3/4 hr ride. They offer different rides for higher prices, High Tea Flight, Moet and Chandon Campagne flight, Sky dining flight. Others activities are available at the Giant Observation Wheel. A tropical rainforest and waterfront dining promenade are features.",,,
,,Nice to visit,3,,Nice to visit to see great view for Singapore but little bit boring ... on the way out no need to take all the pictures printed ... ask them for the soft copy,,,
,,Good. But overhyped?,4,,"As expected it's a great place to catch some lovely views of the city in all directions. But even that half hour journey around felt a bit long to me. There is only so much to spot and see in this small city, I felt.
On the plus side, the queues were much shorter than for example what you can find at the London Eye at any point of time! And I like that you can buy a ticket that is valid for a day as opposed to a just a particular time slot.
It's probably also worth mentioning that everybody else in our company seemed to enjoy it more than I did. So may be it's just not my type of thing!",,,
,,"Great views, short queues but no indication of what buildings the skyline held",3,,We walked into the flyer immediately with no queues and enjoyed the incredible views from the cool air conditioned pod. The downside was there was no map or iPads to explain what the different buildings you were looking at were. The Londin Eye hosts interactive iPads with info in the buildings which makes the view all the more interesting to know what you're looking at and unfortunately this is something the Flyer lacked,,,
,,"Waste of money, there are better alternatives",1,,"It was just 30 minutes ride for a big sum of money. Think of it, you spend 15 mins at the higher side of the wheel. Glasses were abit dusty, difficult for photography. Too expensive. There are better alternatives such as MBS rooftop.",,,
,,worth a visit,5,,This is definitely worth a visit. Reasonably priced and you get great views over Singapore. The process was efficient with hardly any queuing.,,,
,,Great view of Singapore,5,,"So, is it worth the time and money to take this ride? My feeling is absolutely yes. We went on a late Friday afternoon. No wait. Plenty of room in the capsules to move around and take pictures. On a clear day you can see for miles. Trip takes about 30 minutes. Well worth the effort.",,,
,,Eye in the sky!,4,,great experience. the tallest ferris wheel in asia. best time to visit is during sunset. you can catch a good view of the city from the top. spacious cabins and a good time guaranteed. been on it twice already.,,,
,,Birds eye view,4,,"A handy way to get a birds eye view of the city, we were able to have a car with only another couple in so could enjoy the view in peace. There was a large family with very excited children so the attendant was very kind in letting us go.",,,
,,Seeing and believing,3,,"We had put this event as one of our ""must do's"" but on looking at it from different areas we thought that it wasn't moving and was maybe closed for the few days we were there.
Now at home and reading the reviews I see that someone has explained that it moves so gently that one cannot see it move from a distance. So sad that we missed out and warning others, don't let this happen to you. Will be top of the list on our next visit to Singapore.",,,
,,Good but not great,3,,Nice to see Singapore from the wheel but it doesn't have the stunning views you would expect. It does however give you some good perspective of the icy there is however better attractions to spend your money on when in Singapore,,,
,,to see singapore at diffrent angle and levels,5,,what can you say about the Singapore flyer? i think its another place to go on and see Singapore at another angle at a different level from the sky.the flyer moves at such a slow speed you get to see every where with varying angles as you are going around,,,
,,The Giant wheel,5,,This should be definitely in your list of must visit places in Singapore.The Singapore flyer is a giant wheel that constantly rotates and gives some breathtaking views of the city.Couples who dont mind splurging a bit hae an option of an exclusive wine and dine experience . We were lucky to have witnessed the fireworks for of SG 50 rehearsals while we were inside the flyer and it was a memorable experience.,,,
,,Family gathering,5,,"Spend the night time with a group of beloved relatives once for a while in Singapore Flyer enhance our warm bonding. It was my third time in Singapore Flyer, the first two I went with clients for entertaining and I was so happy that our clients enjoyed it. Recently in I was there with 5 of my cousins. They were so exited to see the beauty of Marina bay at night time.",,,
,,Round and round you go...,4,,Its a giant Ferris wheel with air conditioning and headphones. Well at least with them you get an audio guide to the skyline of Singapore. Worth at least one trip ... but just the one ok?,,,
,,Weather dependent but worth coming back to..,4,,"Unbeknown to us this does not operate during thunderstorms and tickets are non- refundable. In fact they should stop selling tickets as soon as the flyer ride is closed. We waited 30 minutes, we were told it would reopen, so left, didn't reopen for another 2 hours. Pleased we walked over to gardens by the bay...however we came back early the next day to redeem our tickets. The ride was okay, the scenery was interesting, would have been good to have a commentary of landmarks. Cost $33 each.",,,
,,Good photo opportunities,4,,"Good value - great views of the city, the bay & surrounds. Great photo opportunities - pick your timings to coincide with the laser light show or the illuminations at Gardens by the Bay",,,
,,Lovely experience,5,,"This is a great way to see the view across Singapore. Coming from London, we kept comparing it to the London Eye, but this is bigger.

We came in the evening just after sunset (around 7pm) when the sky line was all lit up. It was absolutely stunning and very romantic.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Great way to see the whole city! Recommend the attraction highly, they don't over fill the Pods so can move around to look at the different areas across bay, gardens and city views.",,,
,,Nice to enjoy after sunset,5,,"Officially opened on 15 April. It has 28 air-conditioned capsules, each able to accommodate 28 passengers.The Flyer has an overall height of 165 metres (541 ft) and was the world's tallest Ferris wheel until the 167.6 m (550 ft) High Roller, which is 2.6 m (9 ft) taller than the Flyer opened on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada, US, on 31 March 2014. Nice to go there in the evening and you canenjoy whole Marina Bay area from this wheel.",,,
,,Good,4,,Good for skycrapper. Every thing is goooooooiooooooood.i am extremely like it. You should go to at night. It has a good view at night,,,
,,"High, wet and yummy!",5,,Worth the money and the time. Buy the ticket with the Duck tour that takes you out on the bay. You will save over 拢20 each if you do this. The joint ticket also gives you discounts from the nearby Hawkers Market which was very yummy! Dumplings were the best!,,,
,,Enjoyable way to get a great view of Singapore.,4,,"This is a smooth ride and really enjoyable. You feel very safe in the pod. It gives you a terrific view of the F1 track, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands and the bay area.",,,
,,"Great view of the city, and an exciting 'adventure' for the kids.",4,,"We want on the flyer early in the morning, and loved it. Later on, big tour busses started to roll in, which might have detracted from the experience. But it's a grandiose way to see the city, marina, and ocean.",,,
,,Excellent view of Singapore skyline,5,,"Took the flyer this evening and had a panoramic view of the Singapore skyline. As the national day rehearsal was on, we even had the chance to witness the fireworks. The kids (both turned one) were thrilled! Definitely recommend!",,,
,,Fly to a new experience,4,,Amazing! Simply one way to put it! Add this to your list of things to do! We visited of a night time and the city lights were so incredible. We were even lucky enough to see some fireworks on our journey Around and I was so suprised at how spacious each carriage is! I loved it.,,,
,,bit expensive!,4,,wheel is circled about half an hour and it costs $33. is moving very slowly you can hardly see it moving from far away. it gives you a very good view at marina bay. when entering they take a picture of you and give a receipt to collect the picture. at moment you feel very happy because you think that's for free. but when you produce the receipt at the counter you know the truth. they charge $25 for one picture!. there lot of places like that so don't get caught! overall good experience. but not worth for the price i think,,,
,,Nice/different view in the night,4,,Good if you are going in the night time as it is operational till 10.30pm. But ticket counters get closed early. Amazing lighting of all surrounding buildings gives a treat to eye. You can buy online tickets from official website and skip the queue. Ride once at least in any of your trip to Singapore and then skip forever.,,,
,,Great view,4,,The Singapore Flyer is an easy way to get a great view of Singapore. It is a comfortable ride and a great way to get pictures.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,2,,The Singapore Flyer is good for people who have not been on the other similar attractions. It does have a good view of the Marina Bay Area but that's about it. The booking clerk was very helpful and asked us to delay our trip by about an hour so that we could see the views in daylight as well as post nightfall with the citylights on. It would have been nice had there been some audio visual aid telling tourists about the sights visible as the flyer moved. The area around the flyer is quite underdeveloped with no activities and getting a taxi back after the ride was an hour long wait.,,,
,,Great experience,5,,This gives you opp to see all of Singapore. The pods are large and even with 10 other people with us it was so roomy. This is a must see,,,
,,Singapore Flyer - I say definitely book it!,5,,"If you do one thing in Singapore, do this. Might be a tourististy thing to do, but so worth it. Great overall view of the city and if you can swing one cabin to yourselves, even better. We took the flyer on our own with a couple of Singapore Slings at sunset, and it was amazing. Won't forget the experience.",,,
,,Nice view of the city,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is stable and nice. I guess the whole trip is about 35-40 minutes. About 15 people inside the carriage, air-con is enough.",,,
,,"A bit expensive, but view is fine",4,,It take approximately 35-45 minutes to full round. The view at top is very good but charging 33$ is quite unnecessary. And prefer marina bay view which is 23$.,,,
,,amazing iconic,5,,I can see the whole city from up here... So amazing! So many beautiful sight from up there... So close till you can reach out and touch it the sky... Never get bored... First ride then you will try it once more.. And more,,,
,,Relaxing and fun .............,4,,"Spent some time sightseeing while in a business trip and took the tour from hotel by bus.
On a weekday so not much queue either to get the ticket or getting on board.
A very relaxing half-hour ride with a great view over the bay with all the ships as well as Singapore in general.
Nice food court below as well as souvenir shops etc.",,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"You can see beautiful sceneries in the flyer. A little pricey but worth it! My friends loved it, it is better if you go at night though...",,,
,,Great way to get your bearings!,5,,"Fun ride in 32minutes. A good way to work out your bearings of Singapore. Definitely worth the trip. The eating markets area underneath called ""Burgis St"" is fabulous to get a good asian meal.",,,
,,not worth the entry price,3,,We were a family and none of us thought it was worth the while. Its slow and if you have seen Singapore and its surrounds from any of the tall buildings then there is nothing new to see,,,
,,On Top of it All,5,,A ride on the Singapore Flier gives the visitor the opportunity to see the magnificent Singapore architecture in a very relaxing atmosphere. We went with a group of friends and we enjoyed every minute of it.,,,
,,Impressive and worth it.,4,,"The Flyer is a very impressive touristatraction. It isn't cheap, but i have to say it's worth it. the trip lasts about 30 minuts.",,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,On a clear day you can see the islands in the Strait. Not to mention the views of Singapore. The pace is steady and the wind doesn't rock the wheel. We watched a thunder storm coming in over the harbour on our trip it was quiet amazing seeing it come towards you,,,
,,Great viewing...,4,,"Wonderful way to get a bird's eye view of Singapore and start the exploration of the wonderful city. The compartments are well maintained and the ride is very smooth. One does not wish it to end too soon i.e. 30 mins.
Do purchase your tickets in advance to avoid queue....",,,
,,Panoramic Singapore view,5,,"The best place to get a Panoramic view of entire Singapore. If you have been to London Eye, then Singapore flyer may not excite you much, but for the first timers, it is definitely a wonderful experience. Compared to London Eye, you will not have to wait for your turn to get onboard, the best time to visit is during the Sunset, as the Sun's reflection on the skyscrappers will give you a wonderful background for selfies.",,,
,,Its all about the view,5,,"Bigger than the London Eye with a very good view, if time is short visit Marina Bay Sands roof instead, its higher and quicker, takes 30 minutes",,,
,,Crazy about the Cocktail Flight,5,,"Thought this would be a nice alternative to the straight ride being a little extra for the Cocktail Flight, but still found the personal escort to the boarding point a pleasant surprise and then the drink was a nice distraction as we started our circuit. There was no waiting and as they said it was a quiet time we got a module to ourselves. In fact we had picked 6.45pm in June thinking we would get part daylight and part night lights, it worked our perfectly for the half hour ride. We had planned to have dinner down there but didn't see anything appealing amongst the many stalls or one restaurant, but had no problems getting taxis to and fro. Had also been thinking about using the bum boats to Clarke Quay but after a long wait down the Gardens the night before, we didn't attempt the same experience. Happy to recommend for everybody to do the Flyer while in Singapore!",,,
,,High Flight,5,,Excellent panoramic views of the Island city. Not scary at all. Tickets are reasonably priced as well.,,,
,,Singapore Flying High,4,,"We rode the flyer during the day. I'd love to now ride in it again at night time. The vies of Singapore were 360 degrees. It moved at a speed that was slow enough to enjoy and see all the views, but fast enough not to be boring. I felt very safe and secure within the cabin, which we had all to ourselves. A speaker with touristy information playing is a suggestion I have.",,,
,,Breathtaking and Graceful,5,,The Singapore Flyer is a great way to view and get your bearings in Singapore - rotating at a slow graceful pace with panoramic scenes,,,
,,Second time just as good,5,,"I highly recommend you take a flight on the Singapore Observation Wheel. Although not the worlds tallest now (it was beaten by one in Los Angles very recently) at 165 m it is one of the best ways to view of the Marina Bay area. Like many things in Singapore there is a bit of a build-up before you get your ride, you go through the dream areas, several of them... with info about the flyer and its construction and history. I have been during the day and at night, I prefer the night views as the lights of Singapore are amazing especially if the laser light show is on. The cabins are large (seating 28 people a lucky number) and are air-cond which is good as it was really hot in Singapore in July. Yes its expensive but you will have some great photos and get your bearing to find things like the Helix Bridge, Gardens by the Bay, the welcoming hands of Singapore (lotus flower art-science building) Marina Bay Sands and other areas.",,,
,,Great for sunset,4,,"The scenery is awesome, I think the best time you ride this giant flyer is on sunset. When the sun goes down, one by one lights turn on from uncountable buildings out there. Maybe the price could be cheaper a little bit. :)",,,
,,A must visit,5,,Don't u forget to add Singapore flyer to ur must visit list! It has a very panoramic view odpf Singapore at the top! U can even see the marina bay 's roof,,,
,,don't miss this if in Singapore,5,,"Best way to see SGP from the air, we all enjoyed it, both adults and our kid. It's very safe, the wheel turns very slowly, so don't worry about being sick or having fear of hight.
It is well connected with rest of the city via local transport, taxis are not expensive either. You can easily do the singpore flyer and gardens by the bay in the same day, as they are just a short walk across the bridge away.
We especially liked the exhibition after the flyer ride where you could learn more about the mechanism itself, the phases of building it and try some hands on screens for more information and games, all included in the price of the flyer ride.
Definitely will visit again!",,,
,,Enjoyed it,5,,Really loved the view of the city from the Singapore flyer. Love to visit these every time I visit a city that has them. I recommend you do it at night. The colors of the lights and buildings are stunning!,,,
,,Best Views,4,,"When I was more and more higher, I saw 360掳 views, twinkle city secondary rainbow! Like fairy tales.",,,
,,great views of Singapore,4,,Very fast queue and long ride. Amazing views of the city is of course what you'd get from one of the highest points in Singapore but it's also a very relaxing experience especially at sunset time.,,,
,,Nice view at sunset,4,,The Singapore flyer is a trip worth going for during sunset or at night when the city is lighted up. There are benches inside the cabins for elderly people and the view is nice! It's not a must-see attraction though,,,
,,Excellent,5,,the journey takes 30 minutes and a great experience.the scenery from the flyer is still lying in eyes.Splendid,,,
,,A good 30-minute ride,4,,"Nice experience, great views from the large, safe, air-conditioned and clean cabin. Suitable also for anyone with fear of heights - I'm one of those and was surprised of the effect. The ride takes mere 30 minutes and gives a nice break from the city heat.",,,
,,Great,4,,"To get great veiws of the local area take a ride on the Singapore flyer, It is slow moving and has roomy capsules for you to ride in, great ride great views.",,,
,,Great views,5,,Fantastic views over Singapore. Adjacent to the Pit lane area of the Singapore Grand Prix. An excellent experience.,,,
,,BIRD'S EYE VIEW FROM SINGAPORE FLYER,5,,"Singapore flyer is huge / giant observation wheel which consists capsules, each capsule can accommodate around 12 persons. It takes 360 degree round. When we are at top it gives you view of marina bay area, singapore harbor, sentosa and some of the neighboring islands of malaysia and indonesia as well. Its a must do attraction. Cost is sgd 33",,,
,,Nice experience,4,,A bit costly and thorough check up (similar to Airport Security) before boarding. There is a family pack which is slightly cheaper. Overall a nice experience.,,,
,,Bird's eye view of Singapore,5,,Singapore flier gives you a bird's eye view of Singapore. It is brilliantly illuminated at night. A must see for all tourists,,,
,,Great Experience,5,,If you go around 6:30pm you see it during the day as well as see the sunset over the city. You'll be off before nightfall though. It is all really well organised and doesn't feel cramped at all. There is lots of space inside each cart to walk around and see everything.,,,
,,Skyline at night,4,,"We weren't too sure if we wanted to do this trip. However my husband booked the dinner on board as a surprise. The flyer trip was wonderful, the views of the marine Bay Area were fantastic. The dinner however was mediocre and not good value. The service was excellent though and overall we would recommend the experience",,,
,,Rise to the View,5,,"Timed for sunset, the attraction provided a great 360 degree view of Singapore. Price was inexpensive, no line, 5 people in one car that holds 20 +. Sunset and city lights made this enjoyable. Bucket list item go along with London Eye and Orlando Eye",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,We enjoyed our experience. We went about 10:30am and there were no lines and only 6 people in our capsule. We pre booked tickets through duck and pond for discounted rate. Great views over Singapore. Very cold in capsule though.,,,
,,amazing views,4,,"What a wonderful way to view Singapore! Cost $33 per person but well worth it. We took the ride during the day and thoroughly enjoyed it however, we were told that the view at night is the best.",,,
,,Wow...immensly breathtaking,5,,"The Flyer went sky-high on my expectations. As it was the tallest observation wheel in the world, I was eager to ride it. From the Fullerton Hotel, it seemed to be a prominent spoke wheel. At the highest altitude, anyone can feel as if he/she is on the top of the world.",,,
,,Great way to see the city,4,,This is a good way to see the city. We went up at dusk/night fall. Queue was quite long. There are good food choices in the little arcade below. My young children loved it. The ride last about 30 minutes and goes fairly slowly so it's not scary.,,,
,,A must in Singapore,5,,"The Singapore Flyer was a very unique experience for me and my family. At first I was reluctant because I had fear of heights but when I was there, it was not scary at all. My kids loved the flight too. The capsules were big and enclosed and very stable that moving around it to take pictures was easy. Before the flight, there was the Journey of Dreams showing some multimedia presentations and displays. We did not wait too long before our flight as each capsule can accommodate many people and the wheel turns nonstop so capsules are always available. The view from the very top was breathtaking. You get to see Singapore and neighboring islands like Batam. The best time to go there though is around is just about sunset. Be ready with your cameras as it is nice place to take pictures of Singapore.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Larger than the London Eye, this gave us a really good overall feel of Singapore. I'm not keen on heights but this is spacious and goes at a lovely still slow pace so it's fine, there is a seating area within the 'pod' so you can sit down in the middle if you want to.
Don't forget to take camera and binoculars if you have them.
We didn't have to queue too long either which was a bonus!",,,
,,A way to have a good sight seeing锟斤拷锟斤拷,4,,"This is the last place i've visited before got back to indonesia. And i was so happy that i was not pass this place. We can see singapore 360 degrees in range. Been there for 30 minutes we paid 300 Singapore dollar for 8 adults and 3 children,, and seriously it is worth it. Gladly i can visited this place.",,,
,,Soaring at new heights,5,,Amazing experience. Can see Grand Prix track from flyer. Walking distance to Marina Bay Shopping Centre and Merlion Park. We did the walk one evening. Terrific views at night with all the lights in the city.,,,
,,It's a big wheel!,4,,"Pretty much what you would expect from one of these big wheels. This one is bigger than the London Eye apparently. There are great views all around, though you will definitely be distracted by the amazing Marina Bay Sands.",,,
,,"Up, Up and Away!",5,,"Spectacular unobstructed views of the entire island of Singapore. The capsule is air conditioned and handicapped accessible. It holds ups to twenty-eight passengers and a complete ""flight"" takes thirty-two minutes.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,Iconic part of the Singapore. Great views all over Singapore - no queue and very easy fast and comfortable attraction,,,
,,Okay attraction,3,,"This was good, but there are now alot of other places which are cheaper to get a good view over Singapore.",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,one of the highest wheels around. The Singapore flyer gives amazing views of the city and beyond. The pods are big enough to give space to walk around so you can maximise the 360 degree views. Not the cheapest attraction but. Not to be missed. The food & drink stalls at base of wheel were a bit disappointing compared to others we visited.,,,
,,Great experience,5,,The Singapore Flyer allows you fantastic views of the city and the F1 circuit. Although the ride isn't cheap it is absolutely worth it.,,,
,,Wheel for seeing around,4,,There are quite a few of these large wheels around the world now but each one unique in its own way. The Flyer is worth a go and gives a great slow panaroma over Singapore,,,
,,Beautiful view,4,,Every worth of money. View is so beautiful. Cabins is big enough and you can get nice pictures over the city and sea.,,,
,,High above the city,5,,What a great experience - no need to pre-book either. Whole trip takes 30 minutes and it gives a fabulous 360 degree view of the city,,,
,,Great Views :),4,,"Worth the trip,Great View of the bay, the gardens & Marina Bay Sands, accommodated my Luggie Travel Scooter on board,",,,
,,A birds eye view of Singapore,4,,"We paid $33SGD each and the view was worth every cent. It takes about 30 minutes for the Flyer to do one loop and the view is incredible. The cabs are air-conditioned but the seating (a small bench seat in the middle of the cab) is limited. You get a birds eye view of everything from the top and can even organise to have dinner in a cab if you chose. We were staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel when we went on the Flyer and it took only 20 minutes to walk from there to the Flyer. There are also some great photo opportunities on the grounds of the Flyer where you can get Gardens By The Bay in the background. There are the usual cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops around the Flyer but we opted for a Subway sandwich instead before our walk back to the hotel.",,,
,,"Singapore Flyer, a must do relaxing attraction.",5,,"We experienced the Singapore Flyer on our first day in Singapore. With not knowing exactly where to start, we jumped on the Duck City Tours Bus and found our way to the Flyer. It gave us a great perspective of the city and was a great place to begin our Singapore adventures.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Catch a glimpse of Singapore's past, present and future onboard the Singapore Flyer, the world's largest Giant Observation Wheel. Yeah, its an amazing experience that i ve had",,,
,,Beautiful,4,,Great ride on the biggest Ferris wheel of Asia. Beautiful view on all sides. Round takes about 30/40 minutes. If you also have a City Sightseeing Bus ticket (which I also recommend) you get 5% discount in their shop on the Flyer acces.,,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"The Singapore Eye is a great way to get an aerial view of Singapore and its modern architecture.
The day we went the queue was short with little waiting time. Below the Singapore Eye there is a small food market with a variety of delicious cheap eats.",,,
,,stunning experience,5,,"This is absolute must experience. We went early evening so had the benefit of daylight, sunset and illuminations. Reasonably priced and plenty of room in the pods. Would highly recommend as the view is amazing. would do this again.",,,
,,Amazing Views,4,,"We arrived at lunchtime and queued for a short period of time. On the way up to the flyer there is an interesting museum/exhibition with lots of information which was interesting.y

This is definitely the best way to get 360degrees views of the city and my favorite of the tourist attractions.

How could it be better? If there was a little bit of audio in the pod describing what you could see so that you don't miss things!",,,
,,What a view!,5,,I went at sunset which really gave you a gorgeous view of Singapore firstly by evening then into night. Very efficient system and staff.,,,
,,Pricey and staff not so helpful - typical money spinner for the owners....,3,,Great views but very much the same as any other similar big wheel. Best time to ride is at night but early morning offers views as far as Malaysia.,,,
,,You HAVE to do this if in Singapore!,5,,"An absolute MUST if you are in Singapore! Best done twice; once during the day and once at night. I felt safe and comfortable the entire time, freeing my attention to soak up the sights of Singapore from the highest views other than an aircraft!",,,
,,Flyer and Food in one.,5,,A must to get a birds eye view of Singapore. The view is fantastic day or night depending on the aspect you want to get. Slow rotation and air conditioned capsules. When you've finished don't forget at the bottom of the flyer is the Food Trail (old school eats) where you can get a fantastic feed for around $5. Try the chicken rice.,,,
,,Singapore flyer,3,,"It was ok, I bought tickets online so were slightly cheaper, and no queue. Had a capsule with just 2 other people. Great views, but wouldn't go on again once was enough.",,,
,,The heart of singapore,4,,beautiful place and you get an amazing view from the top. Must visit for everyone who is visiting Singapore.,,,
,,Eagle eye view of Singapore,5,,great way to see the skyline and harbour. the wheel moves so slowly you don't feel you are moving at all. It takes half an hour to go round so you get good chance to really look. The capsules are big and roomy and plenty of space to walk around.,,,
,,"Good view, but doubtful value for money",3,,"Popular place. However, costs a lot. Takes around 30 minutes. Fair thing to do, but when staying at Marina Bay Sands, you do not need to take this to get a good view.",,,
,,Weeeee! Beautiful sights!,5,,"At night this was just lovely. Singapore stands out in the dark, with amazing light and colour emanating from the surrounding skyscrapers and marina bay sands. Air conditioned too. The 30 minutes went quickly. Very enjoyable.",,,
,,Must do!,4,,Just do it anytime but after dark is amazing. Try and time it to be up when the lights from the trees are on at the park for an extra special view. You can not go to Singapore and miss this.,,,
,,Big flyer,5,,"Very big flyer that can laod more than 10 person in every capsul/compartmen. Rotating very slow and soft. Beautiful side seeing when we reach the top. Harbours and all tall buildings in Singapore , F1 circuit can see so amaizing. One round about 30 minuts....and at night sparkling city of Singapore will be the best ever...",,,
,,Heavenly experience,4,,This was my first time view The experience was wonderful This is a must visit in Singapore and highly recommended The aerial view was amazing Kids enjoy the best,,,
,,Great view,4,,Expensive for the time on the flyer but as a holiday attraction it is a must do. Nice and slow and not crowded in the capsule. Offers great views of Marina Bay and the city skyline.,,,
,,Probably a must for all visitors,4,,Enjoyed the 360 degree scenery. Reasonable value. Good food court below. Worth a visit. Could do with a few more signposts to the ticket office.,,,
,,We had a great time on the Singapore Flyer,4,,"We were there at opening time and so were alone in a cabin and had the opportunity to enjoy it and take pictures videos without being disturbed by others. The view is perfect, cabins are convenient. You will see the great view of Marina Bay Sands and can't help admiring the marvelous scene. Hang on to your tickets, quite a few restaurants and bars as you get off offer discount if you show your Flyer ticket.
Take your time to enjoy when in Singapore. Great opportunity to take fascinating pictures!",,,
,,Good attraction,4,,"Singapore flyer is good idea to ride, to see singapore from different point of view. The circle is not scary even for old man.",,,
,,Amazing view,4,,"We were in Singapore on a SIA Stop-over holiday, and we could therefore visit the Flyer for free.

The wheel moves very slowly, so you get plenty of time to take in the view. On a clear day, you can see all the way to Johor Bahru in Malaysia.",,,
,,An evening activity idea,4,,"London has their Eye, Singapore has The Flyer. If visiting Singapore you must do this. Excellent view of the city from above. Awesome at night time when the surroundings are lit up especially The Garden by the Bay. After the ride you can just walk around the area or sit along the banks and admire The Garden across the way",,,
,,Excellent,5,,a good places to take a photo cause we are using somekind of a big wheel and we can see all around singapore best places and can take a good picture,,,
,,good for view and photo,4,,"good way to get a look at Singapore and maybe get your bearings. the flyer takes about half hour all the way round, jump on early in your trip.",,,
,,High up in Singapore,5,,"We hit the Flyer very early, so early in fact we had our own capsule to sit in. The views were fantastic and the speed in which it moved felt like it did not move at all. The staff were very helpful and the information prior to joining the flyer most informative. The staff in the gift shop were perhaps just a little too helpful, sometimes people just like to browse.",,,
,,Amazing Experience,5,,Just Amazing. Feeling on top of the Singapore. Try and time it when it gets little dark. You can get mesmarising view of singapore.,,,
,,Amazing view,5,,"The view in the Singapore Flyer is amazing. Try to go around 6 pm when the sun is going down. Also I know there is a dining option in the Singapore Flyer, obviously is more expensive but definitely is a once in life experience.",,,
,,A great way to see Singapore in all its glory.,3,,A great way to see Singapore in all it's glory. The staff aren't particularly friendly. Go during the morning to avoid the crowds.,,,
,,High in the sky like bird fly,4,,"This high circle capsules holds big number of (flyers)people to see different views of the beautiful island of Singapore , as well you could reserve a romantic dinner for two or a group, this place is good for couple ,family with young or teens. Must see for your self to believe you really fly.",,,
,,Great View,4,,If you need good clicks go in the day time. If you want to see the city with lights go in the evening. Awesome view of garden by the bay.,,,
,,A stunning way to see Singapore,4,,"We left this until the last day of the holiday so that we had a better idea of what we were seeing. It is the largest and, in my opinion, the most interesting of 'big wheels'. Well worth the money, just the right duration, and simply stunning views.",,,
,,Bird's eye view of Singapore,4,,"New experience for viewing the city.
Very slow movement only .we could'nt even realize that we were on move.very very slight tilting of the wheel only made one to realize the rotation feel.
Lot of shops around the walk way,especially the jade stone ornaments were very good.restaurant was there.",,,
,,Good views.,4,,It was a good view of the city. Nice view of the bay. The museum bit at the beginning was interesting. Was very quiet in the morning.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"Great views & a memorable experience for the whole family, loved the glass enclosure, & got some great photo's & selfies",,,
,,Fantastic View,5,,Brilliant!! For anyone that has a trouble with heights this attraction makes you feel like you are not even moving. The sights are something to behold. Would recommend it to anyone!!,,,
,,If you don't visit Singapore flyer you dont get a 360 degree view,5,,"This place is a must visit in Singapore, it gives you a bird eye view of the entire city, take a lot of pictures when you visit, it gives an amazing view of the see and the ships aroung.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"Went there with free tickets. It was fun and has great view. But other than that, there's nothing much. The food around there is pretty expensive though.",,,
,,Ferris Wheel in Singapore,5,,The ferris wheel was always part of my childhood days. But really excited to see such a huge one with so much of seating space within every capsule. Amazing experience to be part of anyone visiting Singapore.,,,
,,Great Views,3,,"We went to the location of the Singapore flyer, on the hop on hop off buses. Did not go on was very crowded at the time. Bit pricey especially for a family. Food outlets around are dear.",,,
,,GREAT VIEW,4,,"A great way to see the city of Singapore, views are amazing. Night time view superb. We could see the flyer from our hotel window so was a great sight at night.",,,
,,Sky high View,4,,"not a massive amount I can say about this, it's technically a massive wheel to view the city. The queue was small and the cost was OK. The staff putting you on the wheel were miserable and did spoil the experience a bit. There were only a few of us in the queue (10 or so), they allowed a family of 6 to go together, and a couple in front of us got one on their own, but we had to share, which was annoying since the next 3 were empty so we could have all had our own private experience.

Think next time i'll go to marina sands and sit at the bar.",,,
,,Am glad we did this ride!,5,,"So, 6 years ago, we skipped this ride, this time we decided to do it. Am glad we did. We went around 5pm. Better to do it in the day, towards evening, as you get to really see the view. Am sure it may be great at night, but then you can't get good pictures like we did in the day.
So we got a family ticket of 2 adults and 1 child and paid for my elder son separately. No real lines, so went straight to the end of the line.
We had this LOUD crass group behind us, so when we 'hinted' to the Flyer attendant we wanted to go separately, she immediately got the hint and let the loud mouths go ahead.
She put us 4 and 2 other girls only in our own capsule. So we were 6 rather than 30!
We had all the space for ourselves, got the amazing 360 deg views. The Marina Bay Sands looks amazing right when your capsule is on top.
Took plenty of pictures of the wonderful Singapore Skyline.
Again, well worth the 30 minute smooth ride.",,,
,,Good city view,5,,You get the best city view from the flyer.Also this flyer comes from the worlds top 5 biggest flyer.you get a very good view of the city from singapore flyer,,,
,,SuperWheel Ride !!!,5,,"This is Indeed an Amazing Fun Ride for everyone.
The Giant wheel leaves you awestruck for the moment and experiencing this Ride is an absolute Delight in itself.
Singapores Southern shoreline can be well seen, littered with boats, ferry, cargo ships....
Clicking pictures from an Elevation is great and with friends and family ~ the Joy gets Doubled.
As the Wheel rotates, the view Differs from Marina BaySands to Sea Coastline to City's Skycrapers to Waterfront Promenade to F1 Racing path just underlying south to the Flyer !
Tickets can be pre booked online or bought at the counters. It does get crowded on holidays and especially around weekends.
Also watch out for the weather, as the Ride is Shut due to safety measures and Tickets are expensive and 'Non Refundable' , in likely view of severe thunderstorms or heavy rains, which is a very frequent feature in Singapore !
But A Recommended Attraction Visit , for all Age Groups.",,,
,,Great views of the City,4,,"This was a great way for our family of 4 to have a birds eye view of Singapore. We went mid to late morning, and didn't have to wait to board a cabin.I would assume that a visit at night time would be more spectacular, but it would probably also be more crowded.
The interactive displays before boarding were very informative. Unfortunately, a couple of these were broken.
The only downside was that for a 30 minute experience for a family of 4, it was quite expensive.",,,
,,A sight for everyone,5,,If you visit the flyer ensure you take your passport as foreign travellers get a discount. The views at night is fantastic.,,,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"This is the best view you can have of Singapore, for sure! It is very romantic! And you can even have dinner in there! Loved it!",,,
,,Not as great as it seems,2,,"Visiting a 265m (not remember exact meter) flyer is cool itself so I'm giving 2 out of 5 , but the cabins are sharing cabins ( so no romance can be made up there ) and the bench in the middle of cabin is not for everyone they push to go in ... Usually they put more than the seat capacity in as much as the capacity allows them . The ticket price doesn't worth after all which makes sound as Singapore is not a cheap place generally ... It's not a must see , you can enjoy the flyer by taking photos of it from the bay view which makes the view amazing",,,
,,Great View,5,,"Excellent Place to visit in Singapore ..... view from the Height is very awesome , had a great time at the Flyer and around ... will surely visit once again in the next visit",,,
,,Some commentary would have been great.,3,,"Having done the London Eye and the Melbourne Wheel I knew what to expect. I was a little disappointed though as I thought we could have done with some commentary pointing out landmarks and points of interest.
On the plus side, it was easy to get to, there were no queues and all the shops and restaurants were open quite late so the trip there didn't have to be solely for the Flyer and there were some interesting displays in the way in.
I'd recommend if you don't have your bearings on Singapore yet, but otherwise it's just a rather expensive ferris wheel.",,,
,,Did it twice,5,,"Loved it, great views, clean and cool inside, we did it quite early in the morning(11am) just after opening and the crowds were small only 4 in our car, we also did it after dark defiantly worth doing, the lights were amazing although watch out for the reflection from the glass when taking photos",,,
,,Stunning view,5,,Despite a fear of heights this is an absolute must to get a view of the city and it's impressive layout.,,,
,,Stop over,5,,"Had 8hour stop over so headed straight to the flyer to get a stunning view of the city and port. Can only image how spectacular it would be at night.

From airport to flyer was only a 30 minute ride, then only a hop skip and a jump to other tourist bucket list icons such as the Marina Sands and Raffles.

Visited around lunch time and was very quick to get tickets and minimal time to wait to get on. Don't understand why more people aren't putting this on there list when visiting Singapore.",,,
,,Go on the day time better,3,,Me and my family visited this place at night around 7ish. It's quite dark with beautiful light. I and my family think the same that we should do it in the day time instead then we can see more stuffs and clearer. The speed was very slow after 15 mins we were a little bit bored. One car fit for 10-12 people at that night. It's gave us enough space to moving around and take some pictures (hardly get any good one).,,,
,,Good views,4,,Great views over the city. Takes around half an hour for the full circle. Very spacious inside and well priced.,,,
,,The best!,5,,"I barely jump on a flyer, but since I want to see Singapre at night, I gave it a try and wow !! Take 30 minute to finish, nice cabine with dime light, great view with all glasses, feel so good !",,,
,,It was a nice ride.,5,,I was not so crazy about the ride. I did like the fact that it enable be to see a vast area of Singapore.,,,
,,"Good view, but noisy and busy",3,,"If you want a great view of the city, then this is worthwhile, otherwise there are other ways to have great views of the city. This was crowded and packed with really, really, noisy tourists that were shouting conversations at each other.",,,
,,The view is worth the ride,4,,"I have been to many cities that have observation wheels similar to the Singapore Flyer, but I have never been on one of them.
It is quite pricey, but I thought it was worth it. The view across the city, the Bay and the Gardens by the Bay is great...the weather is a big factor though...
I went on it during the day, but I think it is even better in the dark.

Before you go on the 30-minute ride itself, you can walk through a gallery containing facts about the observation wheel.",,,
,,Stunning View,5,,"Asia's Tallest Ferris wheel, every second is important while you in this. we an see up till your eyes can reach, amazing. Whole Singapore can be seen in one ride. Just above F1, Podium and track.",,,
,,Flyer nice but pricey for time onboard,4,,"The flyer was good, great views and lovey to do at night. A little pricey though for the one trip around, especially when you can go to the skypark at the Marina bay sands resort for half the price and stay as long as you like.",,,
,,Up up and away,5,,Goes so nice and slow around you don't have any worries. The views are superb and if you want you can order and have lunch on board as it takes awhile for the circle around to complete while you enjoy.,,,
,,High in the sky,5,,"Amazing 360 deg views of this magnificent city. Spectacular by day, can only imagine what it would be like at night. Very spacious carriages which are air conditioned. The only negative is the price, quite expensive for the average family",,,
,,"Been there twice, the view is awesome",4,,"One gets a good bird eye view of the Singapore city. The price is a bit expensive but I understand the fee is almost the same for other flyers in the world. Not a must visit attraction, do so if you have time. Otherwise other places to get a good view of the city include MBS, Swissotel and Ritz Carlton",,,
,,30 minutes of lovely views,5,,At $33 SGD not cheap but worth doing make sure you see the electronic displays beforehand as the staff will not let you go back after the ride around.,,,
,,Great view!!,5,,Have been on the flyer a few times. Very pretty at night! We also did the dinner one night and it was really nice. A new experience to eat and go around twice at evening time. Good food. I am afraid of heights but was okay on here.,,,
,,A good view of Singapore,4,,These wheels are a worldwide phenomenon now and the idea is well implemented in Singapore. (No surprise there I guess). There's a good introduction to the Flyer itself and the views of the city make it worth the price of a ticket. Particularly good for photgraphers. Also a stop on the City Bus Tour routes so very conveniently located.,,,
,,Great vantage point of nearby surrounds,3,,"Quite expensive for a family of 4 to ""zip"" around but a good opportunity to get a higher vantage point for photos and perspective.",,,
,,amazing view,4,,"quite large in the cabin and stable, absolutely the most amazing way to have a quick look at Singapore",,,
,,Better than expected,5,,"I am not a fan of heights or of this type of experience, however having been persuaded to go I am really glad I did. The views are amazing, as you would expect, the staff are polite, efficient and helpful and the whole thing is very well organised. We went round once in the day and then did the evening dining experience so got to see the views in daylight and at night, both worth doing.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,This was a nice experience as the Gondola on the wheel kept moving at a very slow pace allowing ample time to take photos of the surrounding areas from a good vantage point.,,,
,,Must try feat,5,,"Singapore Flyover is a must visit place if you ever plan to visit Singapore
It is a big giant wheel moving slowly and covering almost 45kms of visibility from the wheel
Literally you will see whole Singapore from the top.
It is a feeling of of the world.",,,
,,View of the whole city :),4,,"It's slow, but totally worth it. You get to see a bird's eye view of the city. And it is beautiful. Great for some perfect photography :) One time visit is enough though. Tip - Go during the night if your purpose is photography.",,,
,,Leisure,4,,What a great way to see Singapore. Well worth the money $33 AUD. There wasn't long waiting times & the effects to approach ing the ride was good. The flyer itself is solid and gives plenty of time to take photos and see Singapore. Only downside restraunt was closed,,,
,,good experience,4,,"its a good experience, designed beautifully but it runs at very slow speed. such a slow speed that people get and get out when it comes to the starting point. you can see whole singapore from the height.",,,
,,Average,2,,Great Views but entry charge of S$33 is way too high for me. I would rather go to Marina Bay sand and enjoy the view from their infinity pool along with a beer.,,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,Great activity Good way to see Singapore from above get your bearings Expensive but then Singapore isn't cheap like it use to be Easy to get to,,,
,,Great views,4,,"Unfortunately it was the wettest day for three months when took a spin on the wheel, but still worth the ride. Even on such a dark cloudy day we could get great view of the city. I would recommend a trip on this before you walk around the area to get a feel of the city layout",,,
,,Try it anyway!,4,,"My fear of heights almost stopped me from going on this ride, but I'm so glad I didn't miss seeing Singapore from this amazing view. Looking down at the working mechanisms was not helpful, but a quick prayer for safety and I thoroughly enjoyed the ""Wow Factor!""",,,
,,An Epic Experience!,5,,"For $33 SGD this wheel takes you up, 541 feet above the ground. It has 28 air conditioned capsules which could potentially accommodate up to 28 persons. When I visited, they were loading about 10-12 persons per capsule as it was quiet. It is also the second tallest Ferris Wheel in the world, right behind the High Roller in Las Vegas. The views from this attraction are immaculate and the ride last thirty minutes. Prior to boarding there is a lot of informative displays on the Ferris wheel which you can educate yourself on. Afterwards, there is the gift shop with souvenirs for anyone who is interested. This is definitely a top attraction in Singapore as it鈥檚 a moving experience at every turn!",,,
,,Big Wheel,5,,"Its like the Big-Eye in London, this attraction can let you see the entire city. Best to ride is late in the afternoon - not so sunny nor humid. At early dinner you can see the citylights- city skyline.",,,
,,It's an experience - not a 'must-see',3,,"Visited the flyer with my wife for a dinner date. The flyer has 3 types of capsules - a group one where everyone stands, a more private one with about 6 tables-for-2 and dinner, and a few ultra private capsules. We took the shared 6-table capsule. Each dinner that's booked lasts for two rotations of the flyer. Try and be 15mins early so you can make it to your capsule on time. If you miss it, you'll have to forego half of the ride.",,,
,,Not so exciting,3,,while there was a lot of hype and expectation it did not meet any. Not value for money which was on the higher side. The view is not breathtaking. May visit once if you have not seen London eye. This is a bit bigger and spacious then London eye.,,,
,,Great view of the Bay area,4,,Finally went to the Flyer. Paid around $20 per ticket and the entire ride was about 30 mins. Had a nice view of the surrounding bay area as well as the financial district. Recommend to go at night to enjoy the night lights.,,,
,,Great views of the city,4,,Steep entry fee however great for new visitors to Singapore as provides great views and good perspective on where everything is located. Would not do a 2nd time however glad have done once. Would recommend. Quick lines and no complaints,,,
,,Great view,4,,Did this with my Mum who wasn't able to walk stairs - staff were quick to whisk her up the lift and help her board. The views from the flyer were brilliant.,,,
,,awesome views,5,,"The singapore flyer was an awesome experiance. We went up nice and slowely and went around slowely giving you a chance to take some great photos and was able to see a fantastic view of singapore.
Beautiful views of the harbour and all surrounding areas. I highly recommend doing this.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Although I am afraid of heights, I went on the Flyer with friends. It was great, you hardly feel like you are moving but get fantastic views of Singapore. It takes approximately 30 minutes to go all the way round. Definitely worth a visit.",,,
,,Too long and not worthy the view,2,,"Honestly, 40 mins of ride wasn't exciting at all. It's too boring and we saw all the same views which you can have from MBS, but here you are so limited by time and separated by glass, so almost not possible to take pictures",,,
,,Flyer a credit to the city,5,,After a little bit of aprehention regarding the hieght we decided to give this a go and glad we did.The ride and view is fantastic and you can get some great shot up there.Once my wife had stopped clinging to the seat she really enjoyed it and even said it would be great to do at night.,,,
,,Greatest view in town,5,,We really enjoyed the trip around the wheel and made friends while viewing Singapore. Found the queues not to bad with good food stalls at the base,,,
,,Awesome Views,5,,"A brilliant way to take in views of the Bay & enjoy a Singapore sunset. Plenty of great photo opportunities, a must do on your visit",,,
,,Not to be missed,5,,"Great experience .not big queues like the London Eye ,and I believe that it is a little bigger. Fabulous views over Singapore and the ocean . A great experience even for the faint hearted !",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Took a turn on the Singapore flyer, lovely views over the city and Marina. It lasted just over 30 minutes.",,,
,,Beautiful view,5,,Great view at night. Nice to take pictures through the glasses. Quick lines. Good ice-cream below it.,,,
,,Awesome view and must-go to see the aerial view of this beautiful city,4,,"Excellent 360 degree view of the city. For couples, its a nice romantic 45 minutes.I recommend this for everyone.",,,
,,A LIFE TIME EXPERIENCE,4,,This giant wheel known as Singapore flyer is excellent and gives a very good view of this city and then garden around is well planned and very good. a visit to this spot is a must for every traveller.,,,
,,Great views of the city,4,,"Great views of the city and definitely worth the trip if you have the funds. Like everything in Singapore, not cheap.",,,
,,"Nice unique experience .... appears slow , gets over quickly !!",5,,"Had been there in first half of the day, as there were not many visitors, had the complete car access (which otherwise would accommodate couple of families). Kids monkeyed around in the car and we all had wonderful time... This experience is NOT TO BE MISSED.
With kids do carry a juice or something to munch on.....",,,
,,Awesome view,5,,Loved the views from this. Loop goes for about 20 minutes as Flyer continually turns. Viewing cars are large and Air conditioned.,,,
,,Flyer Excellents,5,,"The flyer was fantastic, we have been on this a few years ago during the day and this time we had a 4 coarse meal which was exceptional and for this you are on the flyer for two rotations (1 hour) highly recommend this, the plus is you get to see the lights of the Gardens on the Bay from over the river on show.",,,
,,Business trip,5,,"Singapore flyer is a good way to have a birds eye view of Singapore main attractions. You can see the marina Sands bay , Garden on the bay , Singapore port , esplanade and many more. You can take the city tour bus to arrive at Singapore Flyer. The Singapore Flyers also organise donning facility when you are in the flyer but offcourse at a additional charge.",,,
,,Our Tour started here,5,,We went to Singapore flyer and that's were our tour started. You can see Singapore from the flyer. It's a must do.,,,
,,Great Experience!,5,,Can view the entire marina bay area from the top. I suggest the best time to visit is when the sunset is about to set where you can see the transformation of the bay area from day to night.,,,
,,"It's like the London Eye, but in Singapore",4,,"It's a great way to get views of the city. If you stay at the Marina Bay Sands you'll probably find the view is pretty much the same, except you're not in a pool.",,,
,,Holiday June 2015,5,,We visited the Flyer for the second time. Our previous visit was during the daytime back in 2012. This time it was at night. Spectacular sight and as good as it gets in Singapore I would suggest. Try and time it with the light show at about 7:30 or 9:30pm We visited as part of our Singapore Airlines stop over deal,,,
,,A must see,5,,"Well organised attraction with great views, over the Marina and Bay hotel and other areas. Very smooth so no worries for us nervous travellers. We got of a river cruise at the quay nearby.",,,
,,"nice view, slow ride",3,,"the ticket is quite expensive. the movement of each carriage is very slow, but once you are up you can get nice city view..I think better get on it during the daylight to get clear view, I got on at night and aside from the citylights seen from afar, nothing else to see, coz everything else is so dark. The duration of each ride is about 20-30 minutes. if you want to relax and enjoy the view from high above the ground then try it yourself.",,,
,,"Do this early in your trip, see the city!",5,,"We did this during the day, but I'm sure it is spectacular at night as well with all the lights! It was great to do this early on and map out everything we wanted to see in the city from above. It is so high and the views are breathtaking. The cars are very spacious and we didn't feel cramped at all. I'm a little nervous around heights, and couldn't bring myself to look straight down, but looking out was beautiful and fun enough. The wait was not too long. I felt the price a bit high, but its one of those things you have to do when visiting.",,,
,,Boring,2,,It's a nice landmark to look at but riding it doesn't seem to be worth it even at the discounted price I got the ticket.,,,
,,Excellent experience,5,,We as a group of 9 went a day before the peak holiday season and were lucky to get a whole cabin to ourselves. We enjoyed the view of the evening Singapore city as well as the show going on at the Gardens by the Bay,,,
,,Good view towards the sea n sight,3,,I visited together with my family but we find that it is not value for money. The seaview is good but on top of that there is nothing else to see. Definitely not good choice.,,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,"one of the highlights of my holiday, spectacular views felt very safe, would love to do again with the grandchildren",,,
,,Singapore from Diferrent Perspective,4,,"The Singapore Flyer, or if you like The Wheel of Fortune!!! What a wonderful way to spend half an hour just taking in the sights of Singapore from a perspective that those on the ground just don't have. We tried the High Tea experience, Wow, what a glorious and fun way to see Singapore. Complete with our own butler, we had tea from heights that showed all, as well as vision from all directions. Next time we visit we will try the dinner package at night. The Flyer is a photo package from take off till get off, and what a view.
Peter F
June 2015",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"We had no lines, and had our cabin to ourselves. Was a great view! There is nice street food under the flyer.",,,
,,On top of the world.,5,,This is a must do when in Singapore. One of the very best views of the whole city and perfect for taking many photo's.,,,
,,"good way to view Singapore ""from the sky""",5,,"Singapore Flyer offers a good way to view Singapore ""from the sky"". Well designed compartments equipped with AC that offers a good way to see Singapore from above. We experienced 30 minutes of visiting Singapore starting in daylight and finishing with a beautiful sunset over the city",,,
,,Stunning,5,,Had tickets as part of our Stopover package. Went at night. The views are stunning and the lights of Singapore are brilliant. It is a lovely trip and a great experience.,,,
,,Great Views.,5,,Beautiful views of the harbour and of Singapore. You will not be disappointed.We had a whole cable car to ourselves and were able to take lots of amazing photos. Well worth doing.,,,
,,"Nice trip in the evening, pictures only through the window ! 33SGD",4,,"they close at about 10pm, we did it on a Thursday evening and had a cabin all for ourselfves ;-) (last guests)
takes about 40 minutes and its worthwile.
Info: cabin is completely ""closed"", hence you can take pictures only through the window !!
cheers
Andreas",,,
,,Surprisingly great,5,,Though a ferris wheel attraction would be plain and boring. I was wrong! Nice big air con capsules and takes 30 mins to go around. great views of all over Signapore. Only downside was no commentary - wouldve bene good. 30 mins went very quickly. Great price at around $30-35. Prefered this than the viewing deck at Marina bay sands,,,
,,"Expensive, but Nice Evening Attraction",5,,"We had a nice ride on the Singapore Flyer just as the sun was setting.

We didn't find it super easy to get to, going to Promenade MRT and then it was a 1km or two walk.

For our family it cost approx SG$125 (family + 1 extra child).

We had dinner at the Hawker Market below the Flyer and then pretty much walked on when ready.

It took 30 mins to do a rotation, we had about a dozen people plus us, but we got see what we wanted.

We walked along the Esplanade afterwards which was nice, but as is a small bugbear or Singapore, the MRT was difficult to find here (no Internet to help locate it on map) and so we ended up missing Esplanade and walking right to Town Hall.",,,
,,Perfectly Packaged Experience!,4,,"Singapore Flyer is truly an amazing experience. Singapore can be reached by a 5 minute walk from the Promenade Station. Singapore flyer has huge glass cabins in which they allow upto 20 people. When I went, there were just 8 people in our cabin. From these cabins which are closed from all 4 sides, you can see excellent views of Gardens by the bay, Stadium, Marina Bay and other parts of Singapore. The entire flyer takes 30-40 minutes for each rotation approximately. At such slow speeds, you will be able to take ample of photos.

The tickets should be ideally booked online though I chose to purchase it there. I went around 6pm, so get nice views of the sunset.

This was a splendid experience! It is worth the price you pay for.",,,
,,Experience of a lifetime,5,,"Like so many others the Singapore Flyer holds such a special place in our hearts. My now fianc茅 and I flew into Singapore back in April 2015 and this was our very first attraction to visit. Little did she know what I had in mind as I secretly booked the luxurious Moet & Chandon Champagne Flight. The staff made us feel like royalty as we waited for our ""flight"" in the beautiful, modern VIP lounge. At that time, we were the only 2 booked for the champagne car. When we were called to board I was so nervous as I'm afraid of heights (not to mention other things I knew were about to happen :) As the rotation reached the very top, the views of the Singapore skyline were absolutely stunning as I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me. If you are looking for a place to share the experience of a lifetime, even if just with family and friends, look no further. Thank you Singapore Flyer for being that special place for us :)",,,
,,A very good way to see Singapore,5,,"We tried this as it seemed to be well located near the Marina Bay Sands and Gardens, and looked like it might give us a good view. Well, it certainly did that! Its very similar to the London Eye - a little bigger actually - but the same sort of visual experience.
The ride wasn't overly busy, with a modest lineup when we visited it in the afternoon, but there seemed to be a consistent crowd coming through. The ride itself is smooth and sedate, with the vistas opening up all around, the higher you get.
There are brilliant views of the nearby Marina Bay precinct, with the city also close by. There are hundreds of ships teeming in the harbour and as you get to the top, you can see literally for miles out to the furthest part of Singapore, with endless residential towers.
Its a good way to see Singapore and fund, particularly if you have kids.",,,
,,nice view,5,,"more then just a ride,heres a small rain forest garden below,plus a nice food hall as well,,wonderful views of the city,takes about 30 mins to go round,we went around dusk,went the citys lights were turning on,a must do when in singapore",,,
,,view from top,4,,"We had the Singapore Flyer and Duck Tour when we visited Sg. It was a nice experience, my kids enjoyed it a lot. We love the Duck Tour as it went over the city... by land and by water! My daughters were thrilled with the splash of water! We'll visit Sg next month and we will definitely be back to the Flyer and the Duck Tour.",,,
,,Go here to see what Singapore have to offer,3,,"Take this ride to see Singapore landmarks, you can almost all off Singapore's attraction. There are also a few other attractions in the complex",,,
,,A great way to view Singapore,4,,"We had this down as a must do, and we definitely enjoyed the 30 minute ride, which provides incredible views of an incredible city. We were a bit disappointed that the cabins did not have any form of commentary. Purely our own fault but we wish we had booked either a champagne flight or a Tea flight.",,,
,,Great experience,4,,"Had a great experience on this one, the view is stunning and the speed of the flyer is good enough for someone to have a talk and enjoy the view.",,,
,,Amazing views,4,,"Around 30 dollars for the 30 minute trip. Great views. The pods are huge and fit a lot of people if necessary, I had only three others with me. I went around midday and there was no queue.",,,
,,Whole of Singapore from top,5,,First place we visited in Singapore. 78 Singapore dollars for a family of four( my boys 8 & 18 months). Quite expensive. Capsule very spacious. You can sit or stand and enjoy d view. We loved it. Singapore is very well maintained and scenic place whether you are at top or down. Could see all major attractions from top. It takes around 25 minutes to complete one circle. One of the major tourist attractions and you would enjoy too.,,,
,,Great Views,4,,The Singapore Flyer being the giant ferris wheel. It takes roughly 30 minutes for a ride. This wheel is the largest in the world so you can only imagine the views of Singapore you get. Well worth a go.,,,
,,Amazed,5,,What should i say. Singapore flyer is beyond words. Its air-conditioned. I mean wow... Amazingly breathtaking views and it feels great to have ridden something that we have seen on so many films. They are may be planning to take it down because very less people flock the place. But its worth a sight especially at night.,,,
,,Awesome views!,5,,Great views of Singapore. Go on around 7:00 - you get views in daylight and watch sunset and see the lights of the city at night. Beautiful!,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Amazing view of Singapore. Never imagined the ride could be that smooth and enjoyable. A must see for everyone.,,,
,,Mesmerizing view from Singapore Flyer,5,,"We stayed really close to Singapore Flyer and timed the trip to be around the first laser show at Marina Bay sands. It was so beautiful watching the laser show from the flyer cab. The experience is magical and my 8 year old daughter wanted to repeat the ride. It is safe even for smaller kids and you will not feel the height and scare as the cabin moves at a very regulated speed. We were lucky to watch the sunset, laser show as well as pier lights during our ride.",,,
,,Definitely worth a go.,4,,"Definitely an enjoyable experience for all ages. Slightly awkward location in the harbour area, but can be combined with a number of other attractions nearby. Everything operates very smoothly and easily and the views are very good.",,,
,,Wonderful experience,5,,"This was my 3rd fligt on this Singapore Flier. 1st being in 2008, then 2013 and now 2015. Like to go in the evening dawn hours so that can view the blue sky and lighting as well on the Singapore Skyline.",,,
,,super views,5,,"this was worth the visit, the view is amazing- I'm not a big fan of heights, but this was lovely- took approx 30 mins to do the full circle which gave plenty of time to see the amazing sights of singapore, we went during the day- night time viewing is also apparently exceptional- very pleased to have done this",,,
,,You can see for miles and miles and miles,5,,Certainly worth the ride. I could not believe HOW many boats are hold up in the harbour and the views just went on and on.,,,
,,Must do- fantastic,5,,This is something that must be done when in Singapore. The views are amazing. You really do get a perspective of how big Singapore is. Getting there is easy via MRT or buses. Great half day activity,,,
,,wow....what a spectacular vista,5,,I liked everything about this ride. Huge cabin and only 6 of us were in on our tour. Bonus! Entrance and exits were easy. Temperature inside was perfect.,,,
,,Always Provides a Great View,4,,"We enjoyed our ride on the Singapore Flyer. A great way to see the Singapore skyline and views beyond. We went during the day and tried the night before but showed up right after 10:00 pm and missed the last rotation. There is also a food court (Singapore Food Trail) which is ok. We did eat there for a quick lunch but I would choose to go somewhere else. Let's face it, the main attraction here is the Flyer.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"In Singapore now, we went onto the Flyer, very large compartment air conditioned of course. Takes 30 minutes to go completely around. Obviously very nice 360 views, looking down on part of the Grand Prix track and the Marina Sands Hotel are very close by. Not too exciting, but whilst in Singapore worth a look way up there.",,,
,,Quick and easy- nice view,4,,"We visited on a sunny Sunday evening. There was a small line but it moved quickly. The view was phenomenal and our ""pod-mates"" were all pleasant. Buy tickets online ahead of visit. Kids took tons of pictures. Look at the directional on the ceiling to get a sense of what you are seeing.",,,
,,Scared of HEIGHTS ?,5,,"Singapore flyer has the best view starting from marina basins , garden by the bays , floating football field to the whole of singapore.

It has 28 cabins
which can carry 28 people and they do organise parties also their , and its very slow it takes 28 minutes for one round
So all those who are even scared of heights can hope in here !",,,
,,An eye on Singapore,5,,This ride has to be the best in Singapore. It rotates at a slow pace and gives one the opportunity to have a really good look at the views and to take photos at leisure.,,,
,,Best at sunset,5,,Hi arrived approx 6.30. Sunset 7.15. That night was the rehearsal for the 50 year Singapore anniversary. There where helicopter fighter planes boat fireworks. Once I live time to be there. Flyer was well worth the trip,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"Really enjoyed this, has an audio that you can listen to while you are seeing the sights, take a camera views are amazing.",,,
,,Vacation,5,,"This is claimed to be the biggest wheel in the world! The operators also claim that it is the most environmentally friendly because the drive system uses the lowest energy of all the wheels.
However, the operation is efficient The staff helpful & friendly.
Above all, the panoramic views over the city are unrivalled & attained without pain.
It is even possible to arrange a capsule with a bar ! I only found out after I had completed my ""flight"".",,,
,,A birds' eye view over Singapore,4,,"It's definitely an attraction you want to visit once. It will give you a birds' eye view over Singapore. Fully air conditioned, you will be able to enjoy the view any time of the day. Great to take nice shots. It would be better if the glass of the cabins would be cleaner (to take shots) but the photos will come ok anyway.",,,
,,It is world biggest giant wheel,4,,"No doubt it is the biggest giant wheel in the world, bigger than London eye. We can see malasia with naked eye and few araes of Indonasia with Binoculars. Having a good view of city, see& port and a good view of formula 1 race tarck. But it doest give the amphienece of London eye . It is not adventures ,simply cool for everyone without age limit",,,
,,Admire beautiful Singapore.,5,,"Since I'm traveling on a Singapore stop over holiday, this is one of the attractions I get in the package.
I really enjoyed the ride, they don't let too many people in so I didn't feel crowded. And, oooh, that air-conditioning was the most amazing thing!
I would advise to take a water bottle with you, it's quite a long trip, and drying out would make it even longer.
I went on at night, and got to see beautiful Singapore all lit up! 鉂わ笍
It does seem pretty pricey though, so maybe try get a deal somehow tying in different attractions to save money.",,,
,,Singapore at one sight...,4,,Being on the Flyer is a good experience. Between 10 am to 4 pm is the best time to have a clear view of the city. Don't go on rainy days or when it is cloudy because you will to be able to see anything.,,,
,,Great views from a very roomy pod,5,,"While in Singapore do take time to do the high view sights, this one fabulous just like the London Eye and you can see the views over The harbour and surrounding area.
Wheelchairs can be push on and there is sitting area to the centre, although think you'll wish to stand and walk around flash that camera.
One other thing at the bottom off the 'wheel' there are shops and little eating places in a centre with tables to sit do try the food here, we found it great proper food.",,,
,,Amazing view at night,5,,"Too bad that we didn't reserve a day or two before arriving at Singapore Flyer. If you want to try the private dinner, make sure to book in advance! Nevertheless, the experiece is truly amazing because Singapore is very beautiful at night. Afraid of heights? Don't be! I ensure you that you'll enjoy the ride and you'll forget how high you stand from the ground. :)",,,
,,Viewed whole city in one stance.,5,,i always afraid of height but this one thrilling safe enjoying and wonderful and view can't explain in words.,,,
,,No need to go to London hehe...,4,,"I dont like the ticket price, it's quite expensive. I like to go there on weekdays and not in a holiday season. You could get the whole room for you (and your friends) without have to sharing with the others passengers.",,,
,,Explore singapore from the flyer,5,,"It was a wonderful experience to visit singapore..in the afternoom we were on skyflyer which is like a giant wheel, you can see the city from dere. It is having cabins with glass windows ..we can explore the whole city from dere as it moves slowly for the tourist so dat they can see the beautiful city of sky skapers. We took lot of pictures and selfies. It was grt fun.",,,
,,Fabulous Views,5,,Visit this at night! It's spectacular. There are so many buildings and structures all lit with brilliant colours and you can see for miles.,,,
,,place to see the Singapore from the another angle,4,,A place to see the Singapore from the another angle. Its moves very slowly so that you can enjoy the scenic beauty of Singapore from the flyer.,,,
,,Okay but finger marks all over window,3,,"We decided to 'ride' the flyer at night one evening and we were a little disappointed. We wanted really good pictures to show our friends and family from back home, however many of the windows are full of finger marks so these marks show on most pictures, especially if you have a flash on the camera.",,,
,,Tallest Wheel in South East Asia,3,,Enjoy magnificent view of Singapore in this tallest wheel in South East Asia. Th cabin size is big enough to put in a big dining table. Best time to visit is about 630pm to 645pm so that you can enjoy half the view in the day time and half the view at night time,,,
,,Great Views of the city for a price,5,,Excellent views of the city especially during evening. Best is to go around dusk when you can get a glimpse of partially day and night views in the 20 min cycle that the flyer takes to complete each round.,,,
,,"Nice, would love a spin at night.",5,,"I had a few days in Singapore in 2013 and really wanted to do the Flyer but the F1 races were on which made that area of town a congestion nightmare. It wasn't something I wanted to tackle as a wheelchair user.

Come 2014 during a cruise stopover and it was #1 on the 'must do' list. Due to time limits, tickets were pre purchased on the internet to avoid missing out. As it was, there was only 2 other women, my partner and myself in this nice spacious air conditioned pod.

That day was a warm sunny one which allowed good viewing distance although there was a haze over the water which cut visibility down. Going on a rainy or very still hazy day would certainly not be recommended.

Wheelchair access around the grounds was very easy. The only minor hiccup was finding & waiting on a staff member to navigate me & partner via 'special' wheelchair route to the pod embarkation point.

Might well do the wheel again during 2015 cruise depending on time and weather. If only the ship did a night time stop over :(",,,
,,Pretty Special,5,,"$30 for a one hour rotation looking forwards to Indonesia,back to Malaysia and down to Singapore.As far as I know the only other place in the world where you can see 3 countries at once is in Sth America
There is a small nature walk below and the shops and cafes there are reasonable",,,
,,Great views but pricey,4,,"Very much like the London Eye, this attraction offers great views of the island and the total rotation takes quite some time, so you do have plenty of time to enjoy the scenery. When it is very hazy, the view might not be very good, so do consider this before going up. It is expensive but since it is pretty much unique, there is no way to determine if you have had value for money or not. If you generally enjoy this sort of thing, then you will not be disappointed, but if you would rather keep your feet on the ground, there are many other attractions which are better value for money.",,,
,,Family Tour at Singapore,5,,"Wow! Awesome experience with this! Besides the flyer there are few shopping malls, few nice place they created naturally with the modern thing's. From the flyer we have enjoyed too much the beauty of the city, the beauty of the Sea. This was awesome!",,,
,,Flyer was a highlight,5,,Thoroughly enjoyed our trip up on the Flyer! Even my wife who is scared of heights had no trouble going on it. Easy to get on and off. Great views!,,,
,,Singapore Cable Cart would be a better investment,3,,"Altough the flier is a technology marvel , from a tourist point of view , it may be wiser to spend the money on the To and Fro cable cart , so one way you go at day time and the return in the night. Its cheaper and better experience. However if you want to Singapore Busiess center by night , my take would the at the Top of Marina sand bay Boat.",,,
,,Very expensive...!,4,,Wonderful experience to have. But as same as very expensive. They are arranging a special souvenir photograph for each and every person who gonna experience this Singapore flyer.,,,
,,A must for the keen or casual photographer,4,,If you ever your in Singapore and are at a loss for something to do late in the afternoon it is recommended you visit the Singapore Flyer. The best one is just on dusk as the city lights begin to have their effect and their is still enough light to get a view o the city and Mirage Bay. There aren't enough superlatives to describe the city lights as they take over from the late afternoon. Hopefully the photos i have posted will give an indication of what to expect.,,,
,,An Average place,3,,"You get a good view of Singapore from top. But quite average and not the value for money. The best part is that you can rent a Lamborghini for an hour from the station below the flyer, if you can afford that.",,,
,,Birds eye view,4,,Wow this was an awesome experience. We saw whole of Singapore in a birds eye view. Singapore is much greener than you expect. The tickets were bit expensive but dining in is ridiculously expensive and there are so much better places in singapore to dine in. But its a must go place if you haven't been there atleast once!,,,
,,Fantastic View,4,,"What a fantastic view over Singapore City and surrounding areas, close to Marina Bay Resort and Casino",,,
,,Good for sightseeing,3,,"If love to take photos of Singapore's scenery of skyscrapers, then this is for you. During daytime, can see Indonesia from the Sg flyer. Night time, the lights which illuminates the town area is very nice. Other than that, it is a nice place to hang out because it is near to the sea and F1 pit.",,,
,,"Great Views of the City, probably better at night.",4,,"We went during the day, Singapore is great to walk around very clean lots of people jogging you don't even see any cops. When we went during the day there was no line no waiting. I think this attraction would be better at night so you could see the city all lit up.",,,
,,Flying High,5,,"Its not as scary as it looks from the ground, moves at a reasonable pace, allowing for some stunning pics of the surrounds. Go early in the morning to beat the tourist bus crowds.",,,
,,How world looks below!,4,,"This much sought after tourist destination in Singapore draws millions of people and those who have experienced London Eye,like me, can't but draw parallel to the experience one gets here.however ,each of this has its own beauty when we SEE the World below from a height,quite thrilling!.no tourist can afford to miss this experience when they visit Singapore.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"Great view, as always in Singapore everything works as a clockwork. Have not been there for a few years but can imagine it will get pretty hot on a sunny day...was ok when we where there.",,,
,,Be there done that,3,,"Not the most exciting attraction. Good for family or people who don't want to move around too much. Otherwise getting into one of the bars in the high rising buildings offers better value for money.

For people who decide to give it a go, I recommend getting on the ride on the sunset. You can get day and night view in one go.",,,
,,Birds Eye View,4,,A must do for every traveler who visits Singapore. Picturesque view of the entire place. However i would recommend visiting the flyer in the night for a prettier view.,,,
,,Excellent experience.,5,,What an awesome experience. The views in all directions were sensational. Staff at the flyer were pleasant and courteous and very helpful. Took roughly half an hour to complete the rotation and this was ample to see the sights of Singapore. Another thing crossed off our bucket list.,,,
,,Wonderful view,4,,This is also must visit place. Worth visiting. No problem even for elderly. It moves at as slow pace. . One can feel Singapore . It stands at height 165 meters. The view is stunning,,,
,,Excellent,5,,A thoroughly enjoyable experience. The views of the Singapore skyline and surrounding areas are captured well from a ride on The Singapore Flyer.,,,
,,Good views......,5,,"Bought tickets online so got a discount and printed off our own tickets, we went up in the morning and only had 4 other people in our 'pod', the views are very good but it could do with some sort of commentary so you know what you are looking at.",,,
,,Amazing views,4,,A great way to see Singapore at night. 1 rotation goes for about 30mins which is the perfect amount of time. Wouldn't make it #1 priority in Singapore but a great activity to do before or after dinner.,,,
,,Overpriced dinner and overrated!,2,,"We wanted to try out the flyer with dinner which seems a really cool idea at first. The meal for two inclusive of taxes costed a bit over 300 Singapore Dollars. We had also to buy drinks as extra and just to give you an idea, 1 bottle of water costed 24 Singapore Dollars... The views are ok but we had the same beautiful views from the roof terrace of our hotel... The food was ok as well but for 300 Dollars we expected way more.... We asked for bread and they didn't have either...",,,
,,good,5,,we went in the daylight - always thought - it is better in the night- a tip given was it iso nly in daylight can you see the city in entirety..quite true..enjoyed it.,,,
,,Nice view,4,,"I went there as a team activity with work. It was a nice ine since you have access to great views of Singapore, but very similar to the views you can have from the Marina Bay Sands rooftop.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,4,,"We did this Ferris wheel in June 2015 and found it great, At the top of the ride you are 365m above the ground. The cost is $33 each person with a discount of kids and seniors. There was no waiting. The rides takes 30mins to complete and the cabin is enclosed and air conditioned. If you have a fear of heights I would not recommend this ride. The Flyer is a easy 10min walk from Marina bay shopping centre.",,,
,,Love the Singapore flyer,5,,"I think this is one of the must dos while you are in Singapore. The Flyer is an iconic part of the skyline and beautiful to look at day and night and the flight as you slowly rotate is fab. Amazing views out to sea, of the city and into the Bay Area. Well worth it.",,,
,,Wonderful,5,,"We did the High Tea. Treated like VIP's we had private capsule with our own service person making tea, coffee and orange juice if preferred. a variety of cakes, sandwiches, very delicious. Between the three of us we didn't finish them. The ride takes 30 mins with music. The views are just amazing. No waiting around in a line. ( we were in a private air conditioned lounge until the capsule was ready for us.",,,
,,Best views are as the sun sets,5,,"One attraction we want to visit was the Flyer. The total trip around is about 30 minutes. You share a capsule with several others. They are air conditioned and offer a basic place to sit if you like and plenty of windows to look out of at the city, the ocean, whatever suits your interest. We took several great city scape photos overlooking the marina bay.

Suggest this to be tied in with other items on the itinerary like the river tour from Clark Quay. You can have dinner at one of the restaurants, take a boat ride to the Flyer (separate tickets), then boat back to your original location.

We bought tickets on line, but you can buy them at the venue.",,,
,,amazing view expensive,5,,Fabulous views over the city and harbour. As expected these things - expensive. But the landscape is truly amazing. Shows nothing but beautiful areas in Singapore. Beautiful design. we tryed in the night it we liked the lights and he view .,,,
,,Price-y but wow,4,,It's a little pricey but worthed to pay. The View for most of Singapore around the flyer especially at Night is beautiful.,,,
,,Awesome view,4,,The restaurant in the Singapore Flyer is awesome. The view is breataking and the entire Singapore can be viewed from the flyer. Should be visited as a group.,,,
,,"HIGH , HIGH AND ABOVE",4,,We visited the singapore flyer in june . It was a truly enjoyable experience.We can actually see the whole of singapore. The view from the flyer is amazing. We recommend to visit the flyer in the evening as the view becomes better,,,
,,Cocktail ride experience at Singapore flyer,4,,"We enjoyed a cocktail ride during night time in Singapore flyer. Cocktail or other high priced tickets get you VIP access (less waiting).

Ride lasted for 30 minutes, view was nice. Since it moves so slow, there's no sense of adventure to the ride. If view is the only thing of interest, going on top of Marina Bay sands observation deck is cheaper, gives better view and you can stay longer.

If pressed for time or money skip this and go to Skypark on Marina Bay Sands. Else check out a ride in the flyer. Tickets cost SGD 33 onwards for adults.",,,
,,Night flyer,5,,We've been on the Flyer several times so this time decided to go at night to see the night lights and we weren't disappointed! Fabulous views over the city and harbour with all the changing lights. Excellent view of the Gardens by the Bay where the man made trees are lit up with changing colour schemes.,,,
,,Wonderful Views,5,,An excellent way to see across Singapore. The pods are huge with plenty of space to walk around with 100s of photo opportunities. it takes about 30 minutes to rotate so is very slow and you hardly feel you are moving. There is seating for everyone if needed.,,,
,,It was ok,4,,"I tried the fly twice, once last year at night and this year during the day, well, I suggest you do it at night, more beautiful view but to really see the views should be in the day. Nithing really special , but just take a view and its quite expensive for less than 30mins one round. But I may try again in the future trips :)",,,
,,"Up, up and away!",5,,Another great experience - the slow rotation gives a great view of the city from many different viewpoints. Well worth while doing.,,,
,,Breathtaking view,5,,"Should b a part of ur itinerary.The view of the city is amazing. Also good croc leather bags available enroute.Dont miss the6D cinema opp the entrance,superb n thrilling.Good eating joints in the complex n seven eleven is also in the complex.",,,
,,A Must To Do,5,,"Best time to go is just as the sun is going down. You can see all the sights of Singapore. Make sure you have a camera handy, loved the lights at night.",,,
,,Best view,5,,"Thw vwst view in the city, pribably better at night. The view of the whole city can be appreciated with tgis slow ride up in the sky. Ut us very safe even for the ekderly ny 67 year old mom who is afraid of heights made it to the 30-minute ride",,,
,,Awesome,5,,"If you are in Singapore, do yourself a favour and have a meal on the flyer. The service was excellent and the view was amazing. We had a great dinner, and really enjoyed the lights and action from way up high. An amazing way to spend an evening.",,,
,,Boring and costly,3,,I found it to be over rated and costly. Some scens from a height are very beautiful but after a few snapshots you start getting bored.,,,
,,Short stay in Singapore,5,,The Singapore flyer is a great place to view all over Singapore It is easily accessible via the hop on hop off bus Reasonable price,,,
,,Great Views,5,,We Went during the day. the wheel moves very slowly so we can take a picture with background view of Spore. although we went during the day but the situation in the capsule is very cool and comfortable... a very pleasant experience,,,
,,Singapore Bird Eye,4,,If you wish to have a look over complete Singapore may be some of Malaysia... This is place to be.. Amazing experience.,,,
,,The EYE of Singapore,5,,"Riding the Singapore Flyer is an unforgettable experience that I had. The duration of the ride is approximately 20 minutes. With that said, you must make the most out of it. Although once on top, the view is truly spectacular and overwhelming (I wasn't able to capture many pictures because all I wanted to do, is just stare the entire city.) You can see how beautiful Singapore is, you just wish that the time should stop once you're boarded inside the Flyer.",,,
,,Good experience,4,,"We enjoyed having beautiful views of Singapore while travelling in the Singapore flyer. It is very comfortable and spacious. The best time is the time sun sets because you get to see the country with the natural light as well as when the lights are on. Though the experience is good, its a bit too expensive when buying tickets separately..",,,
,,great views,4,,this is well worth the time to visit maybe twice once in the day and of an evening i was fortunate to purchase my tickets on the flight from Perth to SG which saved time,,,
,,View of Singapore,4,,"1. Children love this thing. One can go along with there family.
2. This can be a romantic place as well. you can book one cabin.
3. Bet time to go there is just before sunset. In this way you can see the day view as well as the Dramatic night view of Singapore",,,
,,Lovely views across the city & beyond,4,,stunning views across the city & beyond We went at night & it was very nice with all the lights on The wheel itself moves very slowly & stops long enough for one to capture some good pictures,,,
,,锛eat place to enjoy the Singapore's views in the night,4,,The Singapore Flyer is a giant Ferris wheel in Singapore. It is the tallest ferris wheel in the world and each capsule which can hold a small group people is air-conditioned. You don't have to worry to feel hot in the capsule. Enjoy the sparkle view about 30 minutes if you want a romantic night.,,,
,,Excellent,5,,This is an apt man made unique creation that gives one a perfect view of Singapore from a brilliant position. .,,,
,,awesome views,5,,"very nice views of the city and not very crowded. been there twice now and great experience every time. a bit too expensive, but comparable to other activities in Singapore",,,
,,Great view,5,,"Great way to see the skyline of Singapore. Had to go when raining but still had a great view.
Takes around 30 min to go around so plenty of time to take pictures.
To get there, brochures say to catch free hop on bus, but you need to get tickets first or get taxi only about $6 from Clarke Quay.",,,
,,Great view of Singapore,5,,"Firstly, the experience of riding the Flyer is must. Secondly, the view is stunning. It was a quiet weekday when we rode the Flyer and there were no long lines at the ticket booth. The ride itself was very comfortable and pleasant and slow paced so that riders could really take time to enjoy the ascent and the view. So comfortable was the ride that our companion--who claimed to have a fear of heights---did not go into a panic although he refused to stand. The cabs are equipped with seats and so riders may stand or sit down throughout the ride.",,,
,,Great Experiace,5,,I've been there twice on the Flyer. It is really nice and has magnificent views around the bay. Also disable friendly access is also there which I appreciated very much..,,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,I am not a fan of these ferris wheels - but I have to say that this one should not be missed. The view of the city and the Marina Bay Sands hotel is quite spectacular. Well worth the money.,,,
,,Something unusual,4,,This is something different to do if you have sometime to spare. Gives some lovely views of the city and over Marina Bay. Lovely seeing this lit up at night.,,,
,,"Brilliant, don't miss this one!!",5,,"What a spectacular attraction! I think it's best to visit this one at dusk / evening. You can catch late sunset and city lights. The 'ride' lasts about 30 minutes, so plenty of time to enjoy and take pictures. We didn't have to wait long to get on, so that was a plus.",,,
,,Nice view,5,,nice view in the night and smooth ride. It takes quite a time for a full circle. = plenty of time to take pictures and enjoy the city.,,,
,,Great Views of the City!,5,,"Located at the edge of Marina Bay area, closer to Marina Square is this landmark.

Its the tallest ferris wheel in the world and each capsule which can hold quite a few people is air-conditioned.

A full rotation takes about 30 minutes and on a clear day, you can even see Indonesian islands in the south. Towards the second half of the ride, you will be greeted with the wonderful view of the Singapore CBD skyline.

The best time to go would be in the evenings, where you can watch the sun set and the gliterring lights of the skyscrapers coming on.

Try it!",,,
,,A glimpse of Singapore at different angles,5,,The singapore flyer gives you an amazing view of singapore. It is an enjoyable experience for people of all ages. The entire place surrounding it is bustling with activity with so many restaurants and the rock garden below is very well made.The best time to view would be at sunset when the lights are on and the city gears up to a colourful look.,,,
,,Massive,5,,"Wow what a stunning structure even when you stand under the wheel, we caught a bus from the tourist hub but marvelled at the site of this imposing site.",,,
,,Top of the Singapore,5,,Must visit place in Singapore if you really want explore Singapore from heights.its worlds no 1 flyer.an 30 mins magnificent journey.,,,
,,Stunning,5,,"Nice ride.beautiful view of the city,You can take a lots of pictures,Is big place and goes very slow.A bit expensive, You can see all the boats and Marina Bay is right there.You can walk to Sands Hotel. Seat donwstair and have a cappuccino or eat a very good ice cream.",,,
,,Nice ride on the Singapore Flyer,4,,Quite tough to get into the venue as we had to walk a long distance even though we took a taxi there. It's during the F1 season and taxis are not allowed to alight passengers near to the Singapore Flyer grounds. So make sure you visit during the non F1 season to get easy access to the Singapore Flyer venue.,,,
,,"My gf finally dragged me there, as I was kicking and screaming ...",4,,"... yup; nice view.

You may wish to view their website in advance for prices, etc.

You can book in advance (for a tiny discount), assuming you can be certain of when you'll visit. There are dining options nearby; these will come up in a Google search ""Restaurants near Singapore Flyer""",,,
,,Lovely Views,3,,Although not as spectacular as the London eye it was still worth doing and the views were lovely. A little over priced. The kids enjoyed it.,,,
,,Trip to Asia June 2015,5,,"Must go,must see, must experience. and must do it at night. it is just marvellous to see all the city light-up. amazing views 360潞",,,
,,Popular but expensive,5,,from kids to seniors this windchannel makes it possible...to fly. Very professional staff takes all the fear from you. Do not forget to be accompanied by somebody with camera!,,,
,,Spectacular views,5,,"Brilliant 30 mins spent on the Flyer. There were only three of us in the carriage, but there would have been enough space for 10 comfortably. There is a large central seating area. The views were amazing from the great heights of the Flyer. 360degree vista. Stunning",,,
,,See the city from the clouds,4,,Singapore Flyer is a copy of London Eye and it is located near Marina Bay. From the Flyer you can see nice panorama of the harbor and the city. You can take amazing pictures from there. Definitely must try place.However the price for a ride is quite high.,,,
,,Good View,5,,Another must do. The view of the bay is just tremendous with all the boats and looking back over the Marina area.,,,
,,Great view on slow wheel,5,,"The ride takes a slow spin and provides a great 360 degree view of Singapore.
Go during sunset to see the changing light. Make sure you have lots of space on your camera.
At the base, it has an interesting food and beverage area serving local delicacies.",,,
,,Awesome night lights!,4,,We visited the Singapore Flyer at night and it was quite spectacular. All of the city lights are visable and make a truly spectacular sight. We were on the flyer when the sea games opening ceremony was happening. We watched amazing fireworks from prime position. Well worth the visit.,,,
,,Stunning views,5,,"When we just boarded the Singapore flyer, a storm came in. We had excellent views of the passing storm, with high winds and loads of rain. I can imagine what a view it must be when the sky is clear!",,,
,,Tremendous View,4,,We came back for a second attempt at this as it was raining when we first arrived. Glad we did as we got a tremendous overview of Singapore with a different perspective,,,
,,Nice view of the city,4,,"We entered the flyer right around sunset so it allowed us to have some amazing views of the city and also allowed us to take some beautiful unique pictures. While somewhat pricey, it is worth the ride if you are in Singapore.",,,
,,Great experience indeed!,4,,"I got my first taste of this giant with my mom and nephew, so we got to get the package rate of 2 adults + 1 child (<12) for SGD 73, sweet! It was around 8 at night, and we thought it was closed already, but apparently they're open 'til 9 or 10. Before boarding, you'd enter a tunnel that would take you to a visual experience - of how the Flyer was built. Then they took a photo of your group that you'd be able to claim at the end of the ride. The queue wasn't long, just 10 minutes or so until we boarded the capsule. The capsule in front of us was one of those 'special moment' capsule called Mo毛t & Chandon Champagne Flight capsule. Up to 10 - 15 people can fit into one capsule, then you fly up, up, and away! The night skyline was breathtaking, if you're keen on taking seriously good picture, I'd suggest a tripod or a remote flash. The ride lasted 30 minutes, and it wasn't enough for me! When you were in the highest of the pinnacle, you just didn't feel it, instead you'd feel this warmth from the pit of your stomach that travels to your extremities and wished that you could stay forever up there. Great experience indeed!",,,
,,Great views,4,,Great way of getting a view of the city. Suggest trying early morning - you may even get a compartment all to yourself!,,,
,,Must experience,4,,"great experience and mind blowing view from the top,children loved it and had a great time.below they have a small jungle with ponds and fishes where children can spend some time.",,,
,,Best view of singapure!!!,5,,"This attraction is one of the best ones in Singapore ,u have a better view that at the sands!!!!Totally recommend for a evening ride and watch the sunset and the lights go on in the city!!!",,,
,,best in singapore,5,,"if you are visiting sg then you cant miss this, this is pride of singapore with awesome views and spectacular build quality",,,
,,Up in the clouds,5,,Really well worth doing so you get a perspective of Singapore. Very smooth and well run. Also right near the tourist buses so very handy to just hop on. Takes near an hour so well worth the money spent,,,
,,Wonderful Views,5,,"I loved seeing the city at night with all the lights and this just gave an even better view. There are seats in the flyer so you won't have to stand all the way through the ride and although they may put you with others in the same cabin, the people I ended up with were very friendly. The views are extremely picturesque and I'm contemplating going back during the day in the future for more photographs",,,
,,Not as Interesting as the London Eye,4,,The Flyer is well organised and a good ride with of course great views of Sinagpopre financial district and out to sea. Well worth seeing and combine it with One Fullerton and other nearby attractions. It doesnt beat the London EYe tho as the historic landmarks of London are just so much more interesting than concrete of Singapore,,,
,,Awesome!,5,,This was a fantastic way to check out the entire city view without worrying about fear of heights. You get quite alot of time as you complete a full circle around. I would do it again as my camera was nearly full after coming off the Flyer. Worth the money.,,,
,,Beautiful night view,4,,"We enjoyed the beautiful night view from the Singapore Flyer. My kids were a bit scared at the beginning but later enjoyed it very much. If we ever come again, we would do it in the evening.",,,
,,awesome,5,,Bird's eye view of the city-- no long lines -- a must do- while in this city DOn't eat at the small carts at the bottom,,,
,,An upscale experience it's,5,,The ultimate Engineering marvel it's and better to have a ride after dusk.The complete ride takes about 30 minutes and worth a visit.,,,
,,a good view of city skyline and of Marina Bay,4,,"The cabins are large, you can sit and the line is not very long. It is nice to take the wheel in the evening for the view if y ou are in the area.",,,
,,good exp,4,,"I decided to jump on this to see Singapore with height; the exp was quite okay - I would recommend this to you all but paying more than 25$, I thought its bit costly",,,
,,Amazing experence,5,,The pathway to the Flyer is great.You do'nt feel anything when you go up so high.Do not forget to take your photo.Enjoy.,,,
,,Aussies 1 night stop over on our way home from UK,4,,We loved this early morning ride around 10am no crowds felt safe could see the Grand Prix track directly below and lots new buildings highly recommended.,,,
,,Delightful!,5,,"Beautiful!! And absolutely delightful!! Must visit in Singapore. You must take that ride. Its kinda slow, but enjoy it while it lasts!",,,
,,A Thrill with a View,5,,Easy access and something different from walking everywhere. You get to see plenty from up there. Daytime is probably better as you will be able to identify more of what you see rather than just see pretty lights.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"Its cheesy and touristy, kind of pricy, but nothing beats the views. Its worth the money and thirty minutes of your time. Go just before sunset to get the best views before and after dusk.",,,
,,Just About Okay,3,,"Since it is visible through most of Singapore,hence could be tried once,however not a great experience,since it moves very slowly and the experience eventually becomes boring ...",,,
,,"Not a must do, you can pass",2,,There is no audio anymore. It is a big slow giant wheel at an expensive price. The views are not very different from ground level. A walk on the waterfront would be same. Time and money can be spent on other attractions,,,
,,Worth Experiencing,4,,"This is a major attraction in Singapore. I find, it is better than London Eye, located in London, UK. One may visit this place just before sunset so that you can see Singapore skyline before & after sunset. This facility is very well managed by the staff .",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Excellent what a view a clear day could see for miles in all directions, this was well worth the effort to go and see and do. Thoroughly recommend",,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,Views are fantastic over the city. We went on the Flyer at night to see the night skyline - would recommend night time.,,,
,,Going high in the sky,4,,it was good and had a nice experience with astonishing heights wish the capsule could have infotainment system and a better sun protection and some cushioned seats,,,
,,A lovely overview of the City!,4,,Wonderful way to take in the whole city and all the attractions around. I bet you just can't stop clicking!,,,
,,Rainy Day trip,5,,"We missed the ride the night before, mind the hours of the ticket booth. Our day ride was delayed by storm, however we really enjoyed the experience once started. Great views! We were on the Singapore Air stopover and we had a coupon for the ride and co located food court.",,,
,,Great View,5,,great experience went through the day and only had 4 people in the capsule. Great view of all of Singapore would recommend a visit.,,,
,,Worth a visit,5,,"Definitely worth a visit, there are fantastic views from the flyer, we went on at sunset but sadly not a great day for it, but we still enjoyed the views I think it was $33 (Singapore) there are other options where you can order a drink (Singapore sling) to take with you or even a pod you can have dinner in, but we just took the standard option, it takes about 30 mins to complete. The evening we went there were no queues we got straight on the flyer.
When we were coming off the flyer the was a Indian Resturant offering a Buffett meal on the floor below the flyer access which we Had dinner in which was really good value and good food, not a huge selection of food but enough choice.",,,
,,630pm-7pm is the best time,5,,"Best time to stay in the Singapore Flyers is 630pm-7pm. At 630pm, we have the bright day view. At around 7pm, we enjoy the sunset and follow by the night view. 2 different view on the same trip!",,,
,,Amazing view of the city,5,,"At a reasonable cost this is the perfect way to view the central city and beyond. We were only in Singapore for a couple of days so decided this would be a great way to see the amazing architecturally designed buildings. Indeed we were right, with a 360deg view of surrounding Malaysian islands, of the Marina Bay, the gardens and the wider port area. If you have the opportunity this is definitely worth your while. A full rotation takes about half an hour to 45 minutes.",,,
,,What a view of Singapore you get from the Flyer,4,,"You get a fantastic view of a large part of Singapore, as well as seeing a huge amount of ships anchored in the Sea around the whole coast. The wheel is comfortable and you can sit and look or stand and move around to see particular places. It is well worth a visit.",,,
,,Amazing!!!,5,,superb experience!!! can see almost whole Singapore from here.I really enjoyed and the time allotted for one round is also quiet good enough.,,,
,,Great views!,5,,"We had the Singapore Sling flight and it was worth the extra cost. We went to the flyer during the day time as we were going to catch the night time views from the bars at the top of Marina Bay Sands. I was a bit concerned that the Sling would be a ""touristy"" below par version like we'd had in Clark Quay but we were pleasantly surprised, it was a proper freshly shaken cocktail and delicious. With this type of ticket you also get to take the flight in a specially Moet champagne themed decorated capsule which gave a sense of luxury to the experience. The views over Singapore and the bay were spectacular and it is a great way to catch a glimpse of Singapore when you only have a few days in the city.",,,
,,A must for anyone traveling to Singapore,4,,"The view of Singapore from the Flyer was spectacular. Gardens by the Bay and Marina Sands Resort can also be viewed from the height.

I advise you to go there before 7:45 pm in order to see first light show of Gardens by the Bay from the Flyer.

For people who scare of height, I recommend you to try this facility because it seems motionless when you are in the cabin.",,,
,,A panoramic view from Singapure!,5,,"With 165 meter high, the Singapure flyer is the world's largest observation view. Great place to see the whole city and take really good pictures.",,,
,,Very good location and nice view,4,,Very nice view of the city and surroundings. Excellent view of the gardens by the bay and the marina sands. Worth the experience,,,
,,Nice View of Singapore,4,,"With the very easy and smooth motion, to me the ride was more of a relaxing experience than to be anxious of the height. Instead one can enjoy the nice view of the scenery around and Singapore as far as the eye can see.
The price does seem expensive for a short ride (my feeling) like this (similar to most attractions in Singapore), especially for a group.
Pro tip: Sunset time is the best time to visit where ambient light is still enough to see around, you can enjoy the beauty of the sunset, and the lighting around Marina Bay and on the lake will be pretty!",,,
,,Brilliant view!,5,,"Once I got over my nervousness I really enjoyed the experience. It's hard to believe that your are moving - the progress is slow and gentle. Even for those like me, who strangely love flying, but have difficultly with heights - I'd any work through your fear and do it anyway - like me you might be very pleasantly surprised and glad you made the effort.",,,
,,Do not go on this if youre scared of heights!,3,,"I went on this a bit scared at the start, it is actually a mostly see through dome so its quite scary, especially when you have a family with kids on with you running all over the place! I didnt enjoy it very much, I guess its something you have to do when in Singapore. The views are nice but it got quite boring, youre up there for half an hour.",,,
,,Great to see the city from this angle.,4,,"Set above Marina Bay, the flyer gives great views of the bay, gardens by the bay, and the city skyline. Quite amazing to see all the boats out at sea waiting to come into port. There used to be a talk you could listen to through personal headsets but sadly this doesn't seem available anymore?",,,
,,Singapore Flyer -,5,,Ultimate Experience. Must visit the place. You will feel like you are in heaven while you are on top.,,,
,,Nice experience,4,,"Great view of the singapore CBD and quite different experience for me as i never got on one before except for the giant wheels in fairs which send you spinning and pumping your adernaline.

Will i do it again probably not? But if you are visiting singapore try it once especially in the night.",,,
,,Avoid the crowds and enjoy the views,4,,"We weren't intending to ride The Flyer, but were convinced to give it a try, which we're glad we did. It's a great way to look at Singapore City from on high and orientate yourself at the start of a visit. If you can, avoid the busier times and days and, like us, you may get a gondola almost to yourself. Or you could be unlucky and be in with a family of 20, though when we went (near dusk on Friday) the attendants seemed to try to control the flow of couples and groups of people they were loading. The cars are generally loaded ""on the move"", though they will pause the wheel briefly to load baby strollers, wheelchairs or the infirm. Take plenty of photos and avoid buying the ones they take of you, unless you like paying more than S$20 for a picture you can take of yourself simply by asking a third party to use your camera - always a good way to break the ice anyway.",,,
,,a must to do in Singapore,5,,"A must to do the Singapore Reuzenrad. Fantastic experience, beautiful views and beautiful surroundings",,,
,,Nice experience.,3,,Singapore flyer is a great way to have a birds eye view of singapore island and marina bay and other attractions. Very smooth operating and comfortable.,,,
,,Good for kid,4,,Good to go together with your kid. But very costly. Really nice to be there in the night. Located in the centre of Singapore.,,,
,,Go during the evening,4,,"My last visit to the flyer was in July 2014. I feel the best time to go is during the late evening when you can get to see the sunset and as the night arrives, you can see the beautiful night view of the Singapore skyline. Worth going again.",,,
,,Average,3,,"The flyer has nice for the views but little else. Unless you get a good deal, may not be a bad idea to skip as there is not much to do other than the wonderful views. Go after dark.",,,
,,Appreciate the creations!,5,,"Absorb the awesome view of Singapore from the 'Flyer'! It was a 1st time experience for our family, kids & seniors in tow. Memorable!",,,
,,Great views,4,,Terrific views from this attraction......it would have been better if there was some kind of commentary or map pointing out various landmarks.,,,
,,Breathtaking...,5,,"What a view, breathtaking view of the entire Singapore. the best part was they were not cramming people in one shell and there was lots of room to walk around and watch the ever beautiful Singapore and its surrounding. Must watch, must enjoy.",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,"we have been on similar flyers in other counties, this one stacks up pretty well, priced well . We had a problem with access as a family member has some vision problems in darker areas, we were given a guide who took us up personally to the flyer, we really enjoyed our flight good for all ages and lots to see would be great for all ages",,,
,,not worth the visit,3,,sounds like a novelty but honestly it is not worth the trip. tickets are expensive and the whole experience is short. we later discovered ku de ta at marina bay sands which offers a higher view of singapore skyline and a lot cheaper.,,,
,,AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5,,This is the best place in which you can see the a great part of Singapore. You will never feel the flyer moving. Best to experience with the whole family.,,,
,,Viewing Singapore through heights,4,,The flyer makes one view the amazing locales of singapore through heights and a birds eye view. It goes at a decent speed so that one does not feel scared and can click pictures and view beneath with ease. Also the view of Singapore from top is worth the ride.,,,
,,The views are amazing,5,,I've done a few 'big wheels' in other cities so really wanted to do this in Singapore. The views are amazing and its a brilliant way to get an overall picture of Singapore and its many highlights - I thought it was great value for money.,,,
,,ASIA LARGEST GIANT WHEEL.,4,,"The best part of FLYER is anyone can go for a ride. When i went for it i was a little frightened but the best part is an 90 old year lady joined us .As the ride started i was baffled that i could not sense its moment . We took several photographs and its worth every penny . People who visit Singapore should not miss this at all.If you go along with friends then there is a special cabin the flyer where you could dine in. So, guys anyone interested in something out of the ordinary should give this a try .",,,
,,Fascinating,4,,i think the full cycle takes around 30minutes. You can have a great view from the gondola towards the city. Iconic landmark in Singa. Best to be there in the night to experience the finest views.,,,
,,Great views if the city and of Sentosa Island,4,,Take your camera for some great pictures not to busy so easy to hop on and off at each location. Bit of a hike from metro but under cover in shopping mall. Would recommend it.,,,
,,45 mins Singapore Panoromic View,3,,"Did this one with family in May 2015, its ok ok just takes you up for 45 mins complete ride with stunning views, but i was told by cabbie that you can do the same in Marina Bay Sands Hotel Skydeck for as much time you want. So decide what suits you.",,,
,,WoW,5,,"it's a great opportunity to explore Singapore from the sky, really amazing, must visit at the day time to enjoy",,,
,,Fly To See Singapore,5,,Dnt skip this travellers. This is the best observation wheel in Asia. Singapore Flyer is the giant rotation wheel to see the singapore. Nd plz prepare to go night. In night u cn c the beautiful singapore city,,,
,,Worth the effort,4,,Best way to get the best views. Pricey as these things always are but worth it as a once off experience to the city. We arrived early and did not have a long wait.,,,
,,Great photo opportunities,5,,"This is a great view of this city, the harbour and surrounds. The wheel turns slowly you hardly know that you are moving.",,,
,,Was something to tick off the list,3,,"This was a good thing to tick off the list, it provided a good outlook of Singapore to get some perspective of the city. It isn't amazing, we went in the afternoon it might be better at dusk to see all the lights coming on. Book online and you save on the entry fee, I think its something to tick off the list in Singapore.",,,
,,One of the Highlights of the Trip,5,,The Singapore Flyer is MUST see if you are in Singapore. We went on this just at sunset and it was really great going up and seeing the sun setting and the lights in Singapore coming up. The Singapore Flyer is best at night.,,,
,,Amazing Experience !!,5,,"totally awesome experience it was, when you are on top of it you can see the whole sea with lots many ships and wonderful view.",,,
,,Amazing Experience,5,,"We took the flyer by the late evening. The amazing thing is that this flyer moves at a very slow speed and one realizes this only when you gradually go up. Initially there was a bit of a scare however once on board the doors close and you have ample seating capacity. Going in the night gives one an opportunity to look at the city by night and must say what a view. One suddenly gets a feeling of nostalgia as you see the city in its grandeur. We were lucky as on the same night we had some beautiful fireworks going on and everything was visible in the night sky.

All in all an amazing experience and must go during the night time.",,,
,,Up in the heavens,5,,"You would not know this wheel was turning,, you felt so relaxed while taking in the sights seen from up top,, it takes around 30mins to do a full rotation,, but plenty of time for pictures,,,you can even book it for a dinner and have your dinner served as you go around,,,what a wonderful experience,,could be very romantic,,",,,
,,"Great view, particularly at night",5,,"We decided to sample the Singapore Flyer at night - the nearby Marina Bay Sands Deck is actually higher than the Flyer, so we had taken a whole heap of photo's and video from there that day. The leisurely 30 minute 'flight' on the Flyer is a great way to relax and unwind at the end of a long day of sightseeing. The lights of Singapore are superb at night and the only downer is that it's difficult to take photo's at night due to the brightly coloured LED lights on the Flyer itself which render all of your pictures blue!!",,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,This is easy to find we walked from our hotel but also had a two day bus pass so passed it many times. Fab views of the city. A must to do when in Singapore.,,,
,,Great Views of the City,5,,"I had a flyer ride first time in my life, absolutely amazing and value for money. The staff is helpful and location is very much reachable by taxi. Was a nice experience altogether.",,,
,,Great View,4,,"We decided to ride the flyer. Went early so we were there when it opened up. it takes a while from when you purchased your ticket to actually board. To me, it's something to do one time.",,,
,,Decent view of Singapore,4,,"Since it takes its time to go around, there is enough time to take in the surrounding areas from different angles. The structure itself is uniquely built-ensure you spend enough time in the area before the actual flyer experience to read all about it before going up.",,,
,,Great Views,4,,Great views day or night but it was good to do on a hot day as it was nice and cold in the pod. Great,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,S$33 was excellent value for a ride which lasted about 40 minutes. We arrived just before 10am and were lucky enough to ride in a carriage by ourselves. There is bench seating but I chose to walk around taking in the 360 degree uninterrupted views.,,,
,,An Experience not to be missed.....,4,,"There is probably the best place to get a spectacular view of Singapore & beyond.

About 40 storeys high and overlooking the majestic sea & the vast horizon, the experience sitting in the cabin - out ""in space"" is just amazing & breathtaking.

Certain days can be hazy though. So come only a clear day if you want to be able to fully enjoy the nice views & the experience.

Night views are very different but just as spectacular. Against the general darkness backdrop, one can admire the beautiful lights stretched across the city's buildings, roads, etc. Also the many lighted ships anchored in the sea paints a serene picture.

Look up the sky and catch a glimpse of an airplane every few minutes, with its blinking light & flying towards the airport.

Certainly well worth the trip here.",,,
,,What a flight!,5,,The flight in the capsules of Singapore Flyer is amazing! The speed is so slow that you can take plenty of photos. I enjoyed every single moment in it. Highly recommended!,,,
,,amazing,5,,We signed up to have dinner on the Flyer around sunset. There is no other view like Singapore at night with the millions of lights. This was a highlight of our trip. It's not just another ferriswheel.,,,
,,Awesome!,5,,"Awesome view! Best time to visit would be evening around 6 pm, so you get view of both the day and night. Spectacular sunset view.",,,
,,Mediocre version of the London Eye,3,,"This was a relative non entity for me and almost a little boring ... The views were reasonable but no more special than some of the more exciting and interesting Skyscrapers like the Marina Bay Sands hotel where it is much more of an experience, sundowners on the deck or dinner etc. Perhaps taking this ride at sunset as suggested would have created a better vantage and experience. On the plus side it is well managed, no queues but very controlled in typical SIN fashion.",,,
,,WoW !!! Awesome,5,,"The Wheel doesn't stop :-) You got to get into it while its moving but don't worry the speed is too slow. Once you are in and start ascending, the view get better and better and better. Super skyline, Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the bay...can see all of them without any obstruction.
Must carry: SLR/Camera
Fee: $33 (adult), $21 for kid
The complete rotation takes around 30-35 minutes.
How to reach there: Get down at Temasek Avenue (by bus). Singapore Flyer is just across the road. By MRT, alight at the Promenade Station (Circle Line, CC4)",,,
,,On top of the city,4,,"Sat in the Singapore Flyer during our city tour last year. Unfortunately it was afternoon time & not evening, so we dint have the view with lights on. You can see the entire city when on top. You stand parallel to Marina bay sands hotel at one time. Even the F1 Track is also a spectacular view. They also have packed lunch facility along with the flyer which we dint take. I would rather spend time watching places, than sit & eat food. Over all a must visit, when on a trip to Singapore.",,,
,,Go during the day,3,,You can see more during the day. The coast on the side of the sea is simply black at night. Allow at least half an hour up in the air as the flyer moves very slowly. Go to the toilet first! Tickets are rather costly but worth it for first-time visitors to get a birds-eye view.,,,
,,Panoramic view of Singapore city and part of Indonesia,4,,"Very good view especially in the evening a birds eye view of the city , it's moving very slow without you knowing it's moving. A must visit , day and night view are different. Went back many times, especially during F1 season.",,,
,,Good but pretty expensive,3,,"Being one of the tallest, if not the tallest Ferris wheels around, its a must-visit. This is my 5th or 6th time there bringing foreign guests. Its a pleasant 30 minute while-away-of time and do get to see a lot.

But PRICEY ! Adults at $32 makes an visit with 3 guests a 120 SGD affair.

Whats Good:
Views are breathtaking and good for a history walk through if you know your Singapore history, from the Kallang River, mouth of Singapore River, and struggle for Water Independence. 360 degrees vistas of things to point out -- Sports Stadium, Gardens by the Bay, Water cachement area, water treatment plant, Marina Bay sands, Singapore Art Museum, to the Durians.

Eateries there seemed novel, especially the old food street. Nostalgic for many of us who grew up in Singapore.

Whats Bad:
1/ They have this ""boarding a flight"" theme which is pretty chintsy. Might have been good 50 year ago when air travel wasn't a common-day affair. Now even the kids are asking why we need to go through the ""X-ray"" scanning machine.

2/ Went on a Friday night -- and seemed rather empty. No doubt due to the high price. Loads of empty booths. Gave an air of deserted wasteland.

3/ Overpriced. Also, forgot to print out my ticket but had it on my retina-screen ipad. Pretty sure the bar code would have worked there but they insisted I go down and collect my tickets. Apparently they need to have physical form.

4/ Staff a bit short and not terribly welcoming.

Tip:
Get the tickets on-line. Its 5% cheaper. Very little hassle.",,,
,,strangest 30 minutes in Singapore.,2,,"Feels ok, strangest 30 minutes in Singapore. You get to sit or stand with people you don't know in a cabin. Look at the high rise view of the F1 race paddocks and bay area. Look art Sheares bridge and still be lower than Swiss hotel without the comforts of a drink and snacks. Then listen to a pretty recorded commentary on the city. Why did I go up for? Only for the sake of chatting with family members in the same cubicle.",,,
,,Moet on journey,5,,When we arrived at the Singapore Flyer we were met at the door and given a flute of Moet. Our glasses were topped up many times during the journey. What great views of Singapore.,,,
,,The biggest fairy-wheel ??,1,,It doesnt impress me like it looks in the tv. Singapore its just too small and expensive. They will not give you any best travelling exprience.,,,
,,Great views,5,,We went on the Flyer at night and what a stunning view of Singapore we got. You get to see 360 degree views and the lights are fantastic. We were on a Singapore stop over so the trip is free. A must do.,,,
,,A Must Visit even just Once,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is one of those attractions that must be visited by every tourist even just once in their lifetime.

The views from the flyer are just fascinating. You will be given an excellent view of the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Barrage, Marina Bay Sands to name a few.

The trip lasts around 30mins (i think more like 40).",,,
,,Singapore's Finest,5,,"It's pretty expensive for the experience, coz all you can do there is just enjoy the view and take pictures. You get to see the entirety of Singapore, but I think once you get to the top and is about to go down, you pretty much would already have seen everything. For us, we're lucky we are friends with a very cool local, we get to enjoy educational fun facts, and she answers our stupid questions like ""what's that"" ""what does that do"" ""what happens there"" and more! :)",,,
,,Fantastic.,5,,"This was a brilliant experience. We did the Singapore sling flyer at 6pm to watch the sunset. The views were amazing great looking out to sea, over the F1 track and back towards the city. We got a VIP ""bubble"" which was great and only shared with one other couple so it felt very special. The sling cocktail was very good. A great mix. I am extremely impressed and will be returning when next in Singapore.",,,
,,Must do,5,,"I went there for the second time , my advise to go it before sunset .
It is a great chance to spot the main attractions of the city from different angles. If you flight was singapore ailrlines you can keep the tikcets to get a discount .",,,
,,Birds eye view,5,,"One of the important infrastructural place, the Flyer is a must visit. It usually takes 30 mins to complete one revolve and gives you a very nice view of Singapore city. Remember to carry ur SLR",,,
,,Great View,4,,"One rotation took 40 minutes, well worth it for the views of Singapore. We visited on a weekday afternoon which there was no waiting, came down & bought our tickets & straight onto the flyer. Cabins were clean & great photo opportunities of Singapore.",,,
,,Make sure you do it in style,5,,We did the Flyer with a glass of Moet and Chandon - worth paying that little extra to get a carriage with few people in it and to have a glass of bubbles whilst taking in the spectacular views on offer.,,,
,,Lovely,5,,"Really liked the Marina Bay, the Singapore flyer is a must! By day you can see the whole of Singapore, by night you can see the lights of Singapore.",,,
,,Great place to walk around,4,,We went there just last week and it was a nice day that many tourists were taking photos around. There are a few eatery around the areas too.,,,
,,Worth a visit if you like this sort of thing,3,,"We chose to visit the Singapore flyer because my husband was keen to ride it. Fortunately, unlike the London Eye, there weren't any queues and it's not quite as expensive, there are no age concessions for tourists. The cars are quite large and air-conditioned with seating in the middle although no one seems to sit for long.

It takes about half an hour all told, it turns so slowly that you really don't notice it. The views are excellent, the river and bay on one side, the city on the other sides and one can easily see all the odd/modern building such as the ""mushrooms"" and The Toast Rack. Beyond that, it's not hugely exciting :o) Usual way out past the souvenir shop and there is a sprinkling of shops around the base and toilets.",,,
,,very nice view of the marina bay from up there,5,,very nice ride . one of the best attractions in Singapore city. the flyer goes so slow so that one gets the needed time to enjoy the view of the whole marina bay district. just the sky park of marina sands hotel gives you higher and better views of the city. highly recommended ride.,,,
,,Speechless,5,,It's a very big ferris wheel at marina bay jusy like the London Eye. We went there at 9am. There were only a few people at that time. Entrance fee is at 33$. It was like a big capsule which could accommodate around 10 or more people. You could even hold intimate receptions or bday parties inside the capsule. It moves up/down very slowly that I didn't feel a thing (I have fear of heights and i made it!). Views were breathtaking!!! I was really astounded. You could see the most of singapore at the top. I was very amazed with the views of gatdens by the bay. Unfortunately it's a one way ticket but really worth it that you'd want to do it all over again! I'll definitely be back next time.,,,
,,Must Experience it,5,,The ride take about 30 mins. The best timing on board is evening for me. So I get to view sunset and night view of Singapore.,,,
,,Great vantage point,4,,"Offers a great view of the city along with the port and the F1 track below. Although the wheel goes slow, the overall circle takes about 15 mins. However, this ride is recommended!",,,
,,Nice views but probably not worth the hassle.,3,,Nice views but probably not worth the hassle. Very slow and nothing you can't see from other tall buldings.,,,
,,A ride with a great view,3,,"We bought package for 2 adults and 2 kids and the ride took almost 30 minutes. The ride is smooth and you can hardly feel the movement, so for those who are afraid of heights like me, fear not and enjoy the view.",,,
,,Unsurpassed views of a beautiful city,5,,"If you have a head for heights, then this is a must. Its S$26 well worth spent to get an amazing view. Singapore is a pleasant and well planned city and is breathtaking from the flyer, even better at night with all the lights. Its quite safe being enclosed in a roomy air conditioned bubble that takes about half an hour to complete a rotation.",,,
,,Great experience,4,,We viewed it in evening.With all lighted buildings the visual effect was breath taking.All ques were disciplined.Everyone should take the flyer.,,,
,,nice experience,4,,i was on city tour on 19/04/15 and visited singapore flyer. it took 30-35 minutes for going 1 round. the view was excellent from 172 feet. a/c was very effective and my children enjoyed it.,,,
,,Nice view,4,,"Went there during the night. The que was short. The whole ride lasted for 30 minutes. Great for photographers looking to take good pictures. Not recommended for those who are afraid of heights. For a better view, do go during the day instead of night.",,,
,,Just do this once,3,,Stop in Singapore for a couple of days on our way to London went on the Singapore flyer it is thing you would only do once I am glad I it is off my bucket list,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Fantastic views all over Singapore including Marina Bay, out to sea and over the buildings of Singapore, takes about 30 minutes to do the full circle. Best done on a nice sunny clear day to get the best views of every where.",,,
,,A MUST to visit,5,,Wonderful views of Singapore skyline. Well worth a trip for pictures and a great view of the Grand Prix finish line,,,
,,Breathtaking views of the city,4,,The ride in the Singapore Flyer offered breathtaking views of the city all while in the comfort of one of the 28 air conditioned capsules. This is one terrific ride to get a great city tour from up in the clouds.,,,
,,Highest place in Singapore...,4,,"You can click good photos of the city from here. But you will need manual focus camera. The visit is expensive, like all other attractions in Singapore. Or maybe its currency problem for us. Anyways its a must visit, if you are in Singapore.",,,
,,perfecto!!,5,,my favourite when I visited Singapore flyer. The capsules are awesome with the view from inside. Even you can book your capsule for lunch or breakfast for two. It is so awesome to have a breakfast with your loved one in the capsule at the top.,,,
,,Very good,4,,As per the Cloud Forrest.....well worth a visit to both the Cloud Dome and Cloud Forrest. Both attractions are air-conditioned.,,,
,,Up above the world,5,,"Unbelievable experience with family and kids. I have been to such places in the past also but for the family and kid, it was their first experience and they were enjoyed with such a giant wheel experience.",,,
,,Great view,5,,"The day we went there was no line up and we got straight on. It was good as 13 of us went and you can fit in the same cabin. Our kids loved it, it was a great view and an enjoyable 40 minutes.",,,
,,"Amazing experience, great views",5,,"Do yourself a favour, do this one! An amazing 45 minute, incredibly smooth journey in an air conditioned 'pod', with seating, which would fit 20 people easily, we had 6. Views are breath taking, I would suggest it would hard to find such a vantage point anywhere else. Great value, if you're feeling energetic the Gardens by the Bay just across the bridge, alsovworth a look.",,,
,,perfect view,5,,"the singapore flyer was very nice we have tried it at night time and we were amaze by the view on top! merlion park, esplanade and marina bay sands can be seen on the top with all the lights everyweher, what an amazing experience!",,,
,,nice and gives a good view of Singapore,3,,"It did remind me of the London eye. It has the same pods, goes for 30 minutes, but it does give a good view of the city.",,,
,,"Good views, food court is great",4,,"The unexpected plan to ride Singapore flyer after we walked from China Town and too tired. We rid on evening time, not long queue. The view is awesome, to see Singapore city along the river. It takes 30 minutes, once we were on the top it was amazing. The food court is good, try meat ball soup.",,,
,,Great picture taking,5,,"go at night time, you can also dine, while going around, have to make reservations, its not cheap to dine, but perhaps interesting if dating maybe or just go for the scenari picture taking.",,,
,,Pity about the smog,3,,This would have been the ideal location to get a birds eye view of Singapore if not for the smog. Pick a clear day and the views would have been great,,,
,,excellent views,3,,"we took almost all attractions of singapore..so we couldnt miss this one too
the evening we arrived to board the flyer...it was almost cancelled due to inclement weather.
but after waiting for an hour, the flyer was allowed to start.
thankfully, we boarded..and got to see the city glittering at night...an awesome experience.....!",,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,What an amazing ride in SIngapore Flyer ! You should not miss this if you are in Singapore as you get to see the whole singapore with a spectacular view.The ride up and down was so smooth that you would not believe that you had gone so high and came down...Hats off to the managing committee !!!,,,
,,awesome,5,,We didn't have to queue for tickets. We boarded late afternoon in time to see the sunset then as it got dark we were lucky enough to see all the building lit up. The views were amazing. I would recommend going before sunset.,,,
,,Stunning views,4,,"The views are tremendous and being such a clear day we were able to see across to Malaysia and many small islands off the coast. The leisurely pace makes it possible to take plenty of photos. It is possible to book to dine or enjoy a glass of fizz, great for a special occasion. We went late afternoon on a Saturday. Booking in and the boarding queue were quick and efficient. There was plenty of space to move around the pod.
The names of some of the islands and tourist attractions could be posted in each pod.
A great family attraction.",,,
,,nice and slow,5,,We loved the light show on the Flyer and hope to have dinner in there the next time we are in town. What a perfect view of the water show on the marina!,,,
,,Expensive for the ride,3,,actually you only see the view of the city. the ticket cost is not worthy as the ride. not recomend if you are budget travel.,,,
,,An obigation to visit in Singapure,5,,Great view and experience. You can delight the view at the most picturesque places of city centre and you wiil have enough time to see them from different ankles. My advice - try to go there about half an hour to sunrise - great colours for photos.,,,
,,Excellent 40mins,5,,"Well worth this view over Singapore and the reaches. Can thoroughly recommend it, especially as part of the Singapore Air stopover package. Even if queezy on heights should not effect too much moves so slowly.",,,
,,Perfect for couples!! Don't hesitate,5,,"If you haven't stayed at a very high hotel, this is the perfect way to see Singapore in all its glory. A tip: do it in the evening to see all the lights of the city come to life!",,,
,,Very expensive for moderate views,2,,Very overpriced and not worth the money.You get much better views from various hotels around Marina Bay.Not a very nice ambience around the entrance either.,,,
,,take your time and enjoy the view,4,,I have been there twice now. daytime and night time. I do live in singapore so I only go when visitors are around. it's actually quite an amazing construction and I like how they provide a holistic experience. you learn how it was built ( if you are interested) and the little showroom is quite a fancy set up. I find the entry fee pretty high-however- the view is amazing. the ride takes about 40 minutes - so being some time as the wheel is going really slow. it offers a nice view into all directions and normally they make sure that the compartments are not too packed.,,,
,,Worth your time,4,,I found it very good. Since I have been to the London earlier it was not too much of an excitement but definitely worth a visit once. Its a 30 mins circle and you can enjoy the view from every angle.The nearest MRT is Promenade and then a 10 min walk to the flyer grounds.,,,
,,Superb view,5,,"We had bought tickets online, so no que. it moves slowly and there are many options of flying too. We loved the cubicles and view.",,,
,,A 30 minute ride,4,,"The ticket prices are Adults $33 and Children $21 (3 to 12yrs). The flyer is open from 8:30am to 10:15pm. I suggest buying the tickets online or even if buying at the counters, the lines weren't that long.

The ride takes about 30 minutes to complete. Both versions of doing the ride were good whether it was during the day or night, you get a different perspective of seeing the city.

If using the MRT, get off at Promenade Station (Circle or ""Orange"" Line) and take Exit A and then follow pedestrian sign to the Flyer.",,,
,,Amazing Experience!,5,,"Singapore Flyer, with an exclusively-designed capsule, the world's largest giant observation wheel. This unique observation wheel offers 360 degrees unobstructed views from every direction. Be it day or night, guest can enjoy breathtaking sights of dynamic Singapore during 30 minute flight. You can request and exclusive dinner for your loved ones and make wonderful moments together.",,,
,,If you want to see Singapore in a hurry then this is the place,5,,This wheel takes you quite high and moves quite slowly. It provides the view of most of the important sights of singapore and helps you to orient yourself for self exploration. Great for photo ops.,,,
,,Flyer,5,,"This is the one which is not be missed, it goes to an high of 165 mts or so and the entire city is seen from there. Mountains and small islands of Indonesia is also seen from the top. Must visit",,,
,,Singapore Flyer :( slow ! not my kind of attraction,3,,"I think one can ride singapore flyer when you really want things to slow down in your ever active life. It gives you a glimpse of singapore city. But i found it very slow. Not my kind of attraction. But heard some great reviews during F1 race in singapore. Also, can check out their wine and dine option. I have personally not tried that yet.",,,
,,That view,5,,Singapore looks best during the night.. the cirty lights are beauitful.. and what better way to observe the city that frrom the top... Singapore flyer fulfills ur wish of viewing the city and its beautiful skyline. A 45 Mins ride but its worth every minute.,,,
,,Great views,4,,This ride is well worth the go. Day or night you can view the city as well as the harbor. I liked the night time when the lights where on.,,,
,,Sitting on the top of the world,5,,"Very astounding and astonishing place to see the whole view of the city 馃帯. Try, feel and see the difference. A very relaxing and calming experience.",,,
,,Nice experience,4,,"It was a nice experience and is very well managed . The views of the city from top are awesome. Had gone during daylight, night time it would be much more beautiful",,,
,,Great Views,4,,Anyone visiting Singapore the flyer is a must. Great views over the 30 minutes round trip. Got a lot of good pics of Singapore,,,
,,Go here first,5,,A great way to get your bearings and see what's on offer. Make the effort to go here before visiting other attractions in the area - gives you a great perspective.,,,
,,Loved it!,5,,Spectacular Views. Goes for around 30 minutes. Great way to see the sheer scale of the Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay. Excellent view of the CBD and Grand Prix Circuit,,,
,,An Engineering brilliance,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is an observation wheel, standing at 165 meters from the ground. The Flyer has 28 air-conditioned capsules that provide unobstructed bird's eye view . Each capsule is capable of holding 28 passengers, or up to five wheelchairs and 15 other visitors when booked in advance.

Flyer offers breath-taking panoramic views from all directions - for example Marina Bay Sands, Benjamin Sheares Bridge etc. Flyer rotates for about 45 minutes and moves in a very smooth and slow pace and one cannot feel the movement.

Our guide informed us that we could book a romantic dinner on payment (the time limit is different from the normal observation time in Flyer).

We enjoyed the exhibition/presentation which has very well
described Engineering details of this magnificent piece of work, with the help of various miniature models ,before entering the Flyer area.

One of the must visit places in Singapore.Photos attached from my personal album",,,
,,Sightseeing the easy way,4,,"If you travel to Singapore via Singapore Air, keep your boarding pass as it will get you a 50% discount on the fare. The buses are open topped which would be great on a sunny day but unfortunately for us it rained so heavily that there was a great waterfall cascading down the stairs...interesting. Obviously it's a hop on hop off tour so you just get off at any sight you find interesting. It does a circular tour all around the city so you will be sure to find something to interest you. There are headphones and an audio guide as you pass various buildings etc.",,,
,,Flyer,4,,"I'm not a fan of heights but this was an amazing experience. We went later at night & the view was spectacular.
We also had SIA hop on hop off free bus & free entry to a variety of attractions... This was fantastic.",,,
,,Showcasing Singapore,5,,"The Singapore flyer with its location and concept showcases the awesome skyline of Singapore with a view to Marina Bay Sands, garden by the bay and Singapore River with Marlion it's worth spending 80 SGD for a family of three.must visit around sunset to have the best views",,,
,,A fantastic view of Singapore and the surrounding area,4,,"Tickets are pricey but if the weather is clear you get a fantastic view of Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. It travels at a slow pace giving you a chance to take it all in. Definitely worth a visit.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"The flyer is great, you can see everything! The capsules are clean and the journey is just long enough. The view is wonderful!",,,
,,Must visit if you are in Singapore,5,,We took Singapore flyer in the night and really amazed with awesome view offered by the wheel. It is worth spending 38 S$.,,,
,,Nice view bad food,3,,the view is of course impressive. But food and service was horrible. Our company had booked us a diner on the flyer. We had to order a halal menu due to some restrictions of my colleagues. Probably this might be the reason of very poor food quality. From what I had understood from one of the staff is that they had to bring their food from a authorized halal kitchen. In my opinion they should revise their producer as it was horrible food.,,,
,,Must go while visiting Singapore,5,,"Go here if you want to see full singapore and some nice photography. Best visited after sun-set to capture the fully lit Singapore sky line. Superb views of the sea, port, Marina bay, Down town of singapore and various other attractions.",,,
,,Magnificent Views Of Singapore,5,,"Brilliant and a must do attraction. The Singapore Flyer goes for one wheel rotation and the views are stunning taking in a panorama of the city skyscrapers, sea and ports, suburbs, landscapes and neighbouring Indonesia and Malaysia. Make sure not to forget your electronic devices and spare batteries and it is a great occasion for taking some holiday photographs.",,,
,,On top of the world .,5,,A terrific ride for each and every one to take. A very slow moving Giant wheel which can be enjoyed by any age person . The Day and Night ride have it's own advantages .,,,
,,a superb experience,5,,"one of the highlights of our visit to singapore. Good organisation, no delays, fantastic unrepeatable views. A smooth ride and good food facilities at the venue, added bonus is the chance to view the F1 circuit at close quarters and to film it from above",,,
,,uffff !,4,,The Singapore Flyer has a breathtaking view. The cabins inside are very comfortable and safe too. I loved the feeling of looking around the city from a height of 165 meters,,,
,,Expensive,4,,"It's a good way of seeing Singapore from above, but one turn for SGD 33 per person is on the pricey side.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,I am scared of heights but I am so glad I did it.The views are incredible from such a height.It is very safe and moves so slowly you are able to see so much more of this of this beautiful place.A must do when in Singapore.,,,
,,Great,5,,"a 30 minute tour in a giant ferris wheel, giving you a birds eye view of the entire city, A bit pricey for 30 minutes but all the same was a great experience, Our kids loved it",,,
,,stunning view over the city,4,,"take a ""flight"" with the wheel in singapore. you can enjoy a stunning view 360 degrees around ...... it is not the cheepest, but worth while. you need a bag of cash for singapore anyway, but do not miss this one!",,,
,,Flying high with Great View,5,,"Since it was my 1st time, I felt much excited yet scared, because i'm a Acrophobia. But I didn't want to miss to see the beautiful city view of Singapore.

The Giant wheel goes slowly so you will not fell that you are going up. You will not regret & will be amazed with the view that you get.",,,
,,Nice view but we'd already seen it from the hotel,3,,I guess if you were staying at low level hotel and went on the Flyer you would think it amazing. We'd already seen the amazing views from our hotel room so were a little disappointed. We went at night and it was very quiet but I can imagine in high season that the queues can get quite bad.,,,
,,Engineering tourisim,4,,Awesome views and very comfortable ride. reasonable prices for entry and for the food on offer. ps leaves Melbourne's for dead!!!,,,
,,worth a ride,4,,"if you have not gone on the eye in London, this is something to try. Even if you have experienced another kind of ""eye"". Romantic setting can be set up for couples celebrating their anniversary or someone planning to propose whilst being away from everyone. Great sunset view so best time to visit will be just before sunset so when it hits the top, you will be welcomed with the most spectacular view.",,,
,,"Best to go at night, the views are amazing!",4,,"This is a great way to see Singapore, it is best to go at night(weather permitting) when you will get stunning views of the skyline. Be forewarned that with the Singaporean humidity the car can fog up some, and make sure that unlike me, your camera battery is charged(I was able to take a few photos before mine crapped out). There are shops and restaurants on the lower level, the latter have a setup like a Singapore hawker centre. If you only have time for a few attractions in Singapore, this should be one of them.",,,
,,Nice experience,4,,"Singapore flyer is good experience with very good views of the the marina and Marina Bay Sands. it takes approx 30 minutes to complete one round, will recommend to visit between 4 to 6 because there will be less crowd but after 6 it will be long waiting time for the ride.
Visited in Dec 2014 with family",,,
,,Lovely,4,,"This is a lovely attraction. Good for a short trip. It was peaceful and showing views of the city & surrounding areas. If you are on a slow-paced trip, this is a place you will not regret to have visited.",,,
,,Awesome View of Singapore,5,,"Awesome view from the top of the Singapore Flyer! Able to see Indonesia island as well as some part of Johore, Malaysia.",,,
,,Amazing views at night,4,,"A lovely way to spend 1/2 hr at night , spectacular views so high up so glad we went at night not as much smog as there was during the day",,,
,,A nice way to see the whole city,4,,"We did this as part of a hop on hop off bus package, along with a river cruise. it was a unique way to see the city when we first got to Singapore. They also do packages for special occasions or you can rent out an entire cabin but that is pretty expensive. Overall worth it but try to find a deal on the price, there are many ways to not pay full price.",,,
,,Giant Ferry Wheel,4,,"Giant ferry wheel , I feel top of the world... very beautiful, very well maintained. Cost effective , it would have been better if there was a guide/ person who gives little information about the places",,,
,,Not bad,3,,For a singaporean.. its just amazing to see the view once it reaches the top.. other thn that it is not much of a thing to exite over.. not very expensive to begin with.. worth a visit once in ur life..,,,
,,Okay okay again,3,,"You will do it if you visit Singapore as its one of their biggest attractions. But its just that and quite highly priced if you have other things to see as well.
There's nothing else to see or do and they dont even offer a complimentary photo. they charge 20-30S$ for a photo.
Again its something I had to tick off my list for my kid otherwise I would have gladly given it a miss.",,,
,,Good ride,3,,Its was a good ride. A tad expensive though. Nothing much for the young kids though. Visit during dawn you get to see the island both during sunlight and night lights.,,,
,,Heights without any fear,4,,"Excellent view of Singapore from the sky's, a comfortable cable car, offering wonderful view of Singapore were from the heights u can virtually identify all the places of Singapore",,,
,,FLY HIGH!!!,5,,Briliant view of Sunset and thereafter beautifully lit up Singapore wow!! 30 minutes of sheer delight and feeling of on top of the world,,,
,,Wow what views,5,,"Our party of 12 wandered around the pod in awe of the view, the Marina, Dragon boat racing on the river, the hotels, the miles of buildings, the Gardens by the Bay, looking down on the supertrees, all the ships waiting off shore, the tiny people and cars like ants from way up high.",,,
,,Worth a look,4,,"Nice way to spend 30min with great views of the landscape, the marina and Marina Bay Sands, from a different angle,.",,,
,,Spectacular View,5,,This facility gives you a spectacular bird's eye view of Singapore city. The 30 minute ride is safe and enough for tourist to enjoy the and see the great Singapore skyline. I will definitely return soon,,,
,,Tranquil panorama gazing,4,,"Having a go on The Flyer is one of those must-dos when you're in Singapore. It's an entertaining couple of hours where you'll have plenty of vistas to gaze at whilst going round.

The Flyer's pace is quite languid, which is a nice change from the rest of Singapore.

The views of the Marina, especially, are spectacular, and on a clear day, you can even see as far as some of the hills over in Malaysia.

Make sure you bring your camera, because there are plenty of Kodak moments to be had.",,,
,,Overprice and not worth the visit,2,,"Tickets way overprice, just a view and a rounds up and down only, nothing much to see other than the construction view all over the place, totally boring.

Other nearby skyscraper can provide better views like MBS Skypark.

Not worth the visit and not worth the value.",,,
,,A must do Singapore experience,5,,"This is the second time I've been on the Flyer however the first time during the day. It is just as spectacular.
If you time your visit right you can basically have a pod to yourself and this is great as you can move around freely and capture all of the views.
I would say that this is one tourist activity that you just have to do when you visit Singapore.
Surprisingly the food centre on the ground floor is also really good, although a little more expensive than the other hawker markets.",,,
,,Another great way to see the sights.,5,,The wheel goes slow enough and is high enough to see much of Singapore. Would recommend going at night if possible just to see the lighted skyline.,,,
,,It's a big wheel.,4,,"Does what you would expect, amazing views over Singapore and over to the harbour beyond. Luckily caught it at a quiet time, not sure I would want to queue for an overly long time.",,,
,,fantastic views over F1 circuit,5,,"Always wanted to go on this attraction and did so this Year well worth the visit, excellent views and not too crowded",,,
,,City views,4,,"Just like the London Eye, the Singapore Flyer rotates high over the city showing you all the key sights from above. Worth a look.",,,
,,Ah!!,5,,The experience going onboard the tallest ferris wheel in the world can't be described in words. You have to enter a cabin and then slowly it strts moving. The feeling you get when you are at the tallest point makes you thing that you are at the top of the world.....,,,
,,Awesome view for Singapore,5,,"If you want a good view of all the great attractions of Singapore I advise you to come here, the attractions is located in an ideal location that allows you to see most important sites in Singapore.

Make sure to go on weekdays in order to avoid the crowd and be able to enjoy the experience, I went on a Thursday morning and it was very quite. evening times are nice specially that you see the lights of the city but that is also when all the locals come for the Flyer after their working hours.",,,
,,Great Vantage Point,4,,"The Flyer is a nice experience, I recommend it at night! It's a 5 to 10 minute walk from the Promenade MRT station and about 20 minutes from the Marina Bay Sands. If you have it in you, you can walk along the water to the Esplanade area, and food arcade by the theater for some late night grub.",,,
,,Thrilling Experience,5,,Amazing thrilling experience. We were group of 22 family members and were in the same enclosure. Amazing view of the city and wonderful life time experience. Never miss Singapore Flyer when you visit Singapore,,,
,,Singapore Flyer our Tour,4,,"Nice experience, We went in the morning with my wife and 5 yrs old daughter. Had nice time, It is slow moving rotating lift.",,,
,,Beautiful View,4,,"Singapore flyer provides an ariel view of Singapore city. A near replica of London eye, Singapore flyer provides a memorable experience. Half an hour ride (though may be slow for some) gives you an opportunity to view Singapore from all directions. Best time to visit is the twilight hours. Conclude your outing with a sumptuous meal at Bayview Tandoor.",,,
,,Good to experience it once,3,,"It is a new attraction in Singapore next to gardens by the bay... It is quite good if you want to have a good scenic view of Singapore skyline, It is very steady and takes almost 35-40 mins to complete the one circle. But I prefer Marina Bay Sands observation deck as it is taller than Singapore Flyer and get a better view from there... anyways good to have a romantic ride on it!",,,
,,Beautiful,5,,This is such a beautiful experience. The view is stunning and the people so friendly. The area around the flyer was fun we had some great food and a little pampering that didn't go a stray.,,,
,,Fantastic. ....,4,,"I wished it would have last longer, the views the height, the experience just top of the world. ...kid did loved it u can see the whole of Singapore. ..",,,
,,Singapore at the height.,4,,It is really unique attraction. And it is like huge merry go round. And it takes approx 25 minutes to complete one round and nice place to take a breath taking view of Singapore. Must try.,,,
,,Great View,4,,The ride takes about 30 mins and its better to go in the evening to have a beautiful view of Singapore business district.,,,
,,Just another flyer,3,,If you've been to London eye or similar place in other parts of the world...then u can definitely give this place a skip....and instead try to catch Sunset - go during twilight (clear skies) to MBS Skypark.....u will love it.,,,
,,Wow amazing views,5,,"My wife and I visited the Singapore Flyer in May and lived the whole experience.
It takes about 30 minutes to go round and the views of Singapore are truly amazing.
No queues so went straight on.
Try to combine a package that includes the open top tour bus round Singapore to save money.
We went on the Flyer (Similar to the one in London called the London Eye) during the day but it runs till 10pm so I guess the nighttime views of this cosmopolitan city all lite up at night would equally be as enjoyable.
I hope this has been helpful
Pete & Wendy Simpson",,,
,,Views to die for,5,,"We took a private carriage tour, with champagne and strawberries, the view is amazing from every angle. No need to go to Marina Bay Sands for a view, you get it from the Flyer. A must.",,,
,,Night time visit,4,,"We visited the flyer while over for a wedding and due to a packed schedule and rain all day decided to visit late in the evening. The views of the night time city are amazing, it feels as if the wheel is moving quite slowly compared to the London Eye, which is good as you get a better view and longer to enjoy it.

Yes it's just another wheel and if you have been on one you have been on them all, but it's about the views and those views are great.",,,
,,Overpriced for what it is,3,,"We had a night flight and although the view was quite good - we paid $33pp and could barely get any nice photos as the glass was dirty, the lights were blinding and there were 8 people in our little bubble. We had better views from our hotel. I wouldn't do this again. I would recommend going to the top of the Marina Bay Sands or the top of gardens by the bay for better views!",,,
,,Great view of the harbour,4,,"This is a great way to get an excellent view of the city, and also the harbour. It's amazing to see so many ships coming in - from the top of Marina Bay Sands you also get an excellent view of this. Like the gardens, this is somewhere to relax for a little while and get away from the helter skelter. But it is a bit of a walk to get there from the main part of town, so you might want to get a taxi.",,,
,,Great Views,5,,It is a must see and do in Singapore! Very unique experience and very fun. It takes 30 minutes but it feels like only 5. Great place to take amazing photos of the whole Singapore. Next to the ticket booth you can take amazing photos of the Gardens by the Bay and the river.,,,
,,"Awesome views, A must do.",5,,"No trip to Singapore will be complete without a ride on the Singapore flyer, A nice slow ride 30 mins for one full rotation, plenty of time to get those selfies in. Great views of Marina Bay, the Gardens by the bay, and the F1 track. Best time to go is in the morning on the first flight at 830 am, as its before all the tour groups arrive. Don't forget your camera though.",,,
,,Wonderful views not scary at all,5,,"Im scared of heights but this was not a problem, cool and enjoyable, great photo opportunities, we went in the day time was nice views",,,
,,A great view of Singapore,4,,We went as a family of four in the morning (around 9.30am) and we were lucky enough to be given a pod/carriage to ourselves. This made the experience all the more enjoyable not having to share. We enjoyed the experience and found the views gave us an idea of the city layout in that area. We have previously also taken a ride on the Melbourne Star and found the experience very similar. Melbourne does score higher due to the fact maps were provided of city landmarks and there was some commentary about the city and its history. I would have given higher ratings if Singapore flyer provided these simple things.,,,
,,Great view of the city skyline,4,,Nice way to be on top of singapore...you get some good view of parts of the city. some photo opps :),,,
,,Interesting overview of the city,4,,One must do this in Singapore for whatever it is worth! Gives a lovely overview of the city. I liked the sights that it provides with the revolving capsules within the wheel. The entry price can be a tad over-priced but it costs to keep such projects going.,,,
,,great experience,5,,this was a wonderful experience. I am not keen on heights but this was so fascinating I was fine. It was a lovely clear day when we had this ride and the view was breathtaking. We had a pod for the four of us,,,
,,Must do as a tourist,4,,"It may be a cliche to ride the Singapore Flyer - but the views are unlike anything you have ever seen. Each car is air conditioned, and the actual mechanics of this great wheel will be of interest to both children and adults alike! In a word - awesome. Check into the special meals/ champagne to make your flight unique.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"We did the flyer during the day, so we could see everything. I wouldn't do it at night, unless you know what you would be looking at. It would have been great if there was a commentary.",,,
,,AAAWWWEEESSSOOOMMMEEE.......... Must do.,5,,If you buy your ticket online $33 for an hour of views of this amazing city. If you only have 1 day here you must do this. And Gardens by the Bay.,,,
,,great attraction,5,,"This gets some bad press but we thought it was ace! We had a pod to ourselves and enjoyed every minute of it, great staff great views I think a must do on your visit!",,,
,,you can see forever!,5,,This is one of the largest flyers (ferris wheels) in the world. It moves very slowly and is very stable. You can see the whole city as well as many out islands. The complex is going to be getting an overhaul soon and will add other attractions.,,,
,,Simply Spectacular,5,,"I was simply taken back by the beauty of the city and what better way than to view it all from the Singapore Flyer. The price was fair and there were a few things before you go up. Make sure you don't get caught up in taking photos, just take a moment and enjoy the views!",,,
,,have ride to experience birds eye view of singapore.,4,,though little expensive (SGD33) its worth bcos you are in the worlds biggest gaint wheel. yu get too see the singapore from a brids eye view at 165 m height. it was overall a good experience..,,,
,,Worth a visit every single time,5,,"The Singapore Flyer gives a bird's eye view to the Gardens by the Bay area, Marina bay and the amazing buildings that line the waterfront. The glass enclosure is secure and the rotation is slow so that to not make it seem uncomfortable. It is safe! The ticket costs 33 SGD per person but the view makes the price totally worth it. The Flyer takes a 360 deg round and you will be informed by a voice over when you reach the top most point. You will not even feel the movement so smooth and slow is the movement. Go for it!",,,
,,Fascinating views of the city,5,,Another typical engineering marvel that one can find in Singapore. You feel very safe and secure suspended in the module even at 165 metres above the ground level. The movement is so slow that even people who are prone to motion-sickness can cope with it. Great photo opportunities to take in the cityscapes.,,,
,,Amazing ride - must visit for every tourist,5,,Every traveler must take this experience of Singapore flyer ride. Its not scary at all and trust me you will thoroughly enjoy the ride. Singapore trip is incomplete if you don't take a ride of Singapore flyer.,,,
,,Once around singapore!,5,,"The flyer will take you for a full 360 degrees around at the perfect speed with which you can click as many pictures as you like, and yet enjoy the view. One will first see the Singapore GP grand stand, and as the elevation gets better, one can see deep into the ocean, and the singapore port, and further higher, far deep into sea, indonesia, the full singapore skyline when on top, and as it gets to the other side, the merlion park, the floating stage, the MBS Hotel, and comes down back to where we started the whole experience is amazing!! worth the money!",,,
,,Nice view... but very expensive,3,,The view over Singapore is superb... but the price of a ride is extremly high. It's not worth it in my opinon.,,,
,,Must try this,4,,"This looks scary but not actually. It moves very slow and have big container each flyer, so for people who are afraid with the height still can enjoy Singapore view. And also I think better on the night view than the afternoon one, consider the weather also which is always hot in the noon.",,,
,,Terrifying,4,,"I don't like heights at all, so if you suffer from the same affliction, and get talked into taking a trip on the Singapore Flyer, just grit your teeth and do it. You can see the whole country from this thing!",,,
,,Breathtaking views,5,,"The best views are from here.
Worth the ride.
Good for photos and videos.
I did during the day .i presume the night views maybe just as spectacular.
The singapore flyer area is quiet and peaceful.very organised.the public toilets however need improvement.the foodmarket down there is not recommended.",,,
,,A fun thing to do-,4,,"Try and schedule this for the morning since afternoon thunder storms frequently shut this down. The entire experience lasted about 30 minutes...it's very smooth, no rocking or even the sensation of moving.",,,
,,Awesome Aerial View,4,,"You get a great view of the city , plus the F1 track below, a floating football stadium,marina bay sands , the merlion and the beach with lot of ships and boats.
Its a 30 mins ride seems worth the amount. We purchased the tickets online and got a discount of 5% so that is advisable. Suggest to buy a combi ticket with flyer + duck tour so that you can use the duck tour to go to Merlion and the gardens by the bay without walking much.",,,
,,On high,4,,It is expensive but it pays off when you are there on high and looks at the city from an amazing angle. Sunset is beautiful. If you want to spend a little more you can drink champagne in Moet&Chandon cabin.,,,
,,Must do in Singapore,4,,"We were there in a quiet time so had the capsule to ourselves. Fantastic views of Singapore, very peaceful and a great opportunity for photo taking!",,,
,,"Must Do, Great view of the city",3,,"Singapore flyer is a must do if you are visiting Singapore. You get a birds eye view of the city. Highly professional staff. Don't forget yo bring your camera. Unfortunately my ride was cut short, since it started raining, with thunder and lighting so it was temporarily suspended that day.",,,
,,With High Tea Package,4,,We had the high tea package and it had been a great experience. The afternoon treats were delish and the view was breathtaking. I thought I would be a bit anxious due to the elevation but it felt really safe.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"This Singapore flyer is unique best to go in evening to see all the lights, the bridges. You can even book a dinner tour if you choose. It seats about 10 people per car",,,
,,Good experience,4,,"My friend and I went on the Flyer on our first night in Singapore, which turned out to be a good decision as we got to see the 'lay of the land', so to speak. This formed a good foundation for our subsequent days of exploring the city-state. And the night-time view was very beautiful. The ride on the Flyer was a little long though; it started to get a little boring towards the end. All told, we enjoyed it.",,,
,,165 mtrs high!!,4,,"Its kind of ""London eye"" wheel, Bit of expensive ride $35 for 30 minutes,The best time to hitch a ride is at dusk when the entire row of downtown skyscrapers is softly lit.",,,
,,Great Views of Singapore,4,,Worth the money for the views you get. Great place for photographers to get their pics. It takes about 30mins to complete your ride and one rotation. Kindly go on a clear and bright day to get far away views.,,,
,,A must-do for any tourist!,4,,"I've been in this a couple of times, n all occasions was accompanied by friends or relatives visiting Spore!
U can catch a birds eye view of e city area on a good clear day!
Try to get discounted tickets from tour companies, as tix are quite pricy at e venue!
Quite a few eating areas on spot, and below is the duck tour n hippo bus tours.. So u can do land tours after gng up in e wheel..",,,
,,"The ""London Eye"" in Singapore.",5,,Well worth the trip up and over in a Pod. To get views of the Harbour and the shipping. The Botanical gardens the ship on a roof. Your able to see a good piece of the Singapore skyline.,,,
,,Superb,5,,"This is one place from where you can view the city at one go, the car race track below is good, the dock view is also amazing and offcourse the floating football ground below is fun to watch.",,,
,,Excellent,5,,Very slow turning and excellent views over the bay and pit lane of the F1 circuit. At $SG 33 for 'elders' it it well worth the money and a 'must do' whilst in Singapore,,,
,,Spectacular views,5,,"The Singapore Flyer was on my must do list for Singapore.
The flight lasts 30 mins with the highlight being the view from the top, 165m as announced over the PA.
The enormous number of ships in the harbour & the view across to Marina Bay Sands is amazing.
Don't forget to have a gelati afterwards beside the river whilst appreciating the people watching.",,,
,,Pretty views,3,,"Really pretty views at night (I'd imagine the same by day) but there wasn't really any atmosphere either in the pre-flyer stage or actually while up there. Pleased I've done but wouldn't do again.
The view from the viewing platform of Marina Bay Sands is just as good.",,,
,,above singapore,3,,"thought it was expensive but enjoyed the views of Singapore,great for taking photos didn't even feel it moving. area where it is has good eating choices and the duck boat tour is right next to it",,,
,,flying high,5,,"we stayed in singapore for two nights as a stopover on our way back from bali and had to go on the singapore flyer, really glad we did what an experience,the views especially from the top are breathtaking.we went on it during the day and again at night to get different perceptions of the views both were brilliant,would recomend this to all.",,,
,,Great Views,4,,"Went in Dec 14. First: this gives a great view of city of Singapore and the Bay with ships scattered. Worth a visit.
We went when it started raining in between , so the wheel stopped and again started. But the clouds and rains and the lightning made a good view to watch. The wheel was stopped for an hour later due to bevy rains.",,,
,,Relax and Enjoy Singapore's Skyline!,4,,"Some would say that there is ""nothing much to it"". Well I would still recommend that tourists visiting Singapore for the first time should ride the Singapore Flyer! It is a simple relaxing 30mins ride for one rotation, but you should ride it for an hour to truly appreciate Singapore's Skyline.

On occasions such as Valentine's, the Singapore flyer also offers special packages such as classy meals in the capsules specially catered for a romantic date!",,,
,,So cool!,5,,Ride it both during the day and night. Also go up to the mountain top for dinner at sunset. Gorgeous city views fromn up there. Doing an unlimited rides pass with two attracitons is your best value/opion.,,,
,,nyc experience,4,,"Despite the fact that it is simply a ride in a cooled lodge, the experience is awesome. Grand perspectives, certainly justified regardless of the little cost. There is a Food Court on the ground floor that has nearby nourishments, does not look great but rather the sustenance is clean, a lot of it and extraordinary tasting.",,,
,,Biggest flyer ever,4,,"When i vist london, I also take a london eye, but singapore flyer is much bigger than london eye and the night view is awsome.",,,
,,Great night view,3,,"Nothing much at that area and the walk from the mrt station to the exact location was a bit far. The view of the city was magnificent at night, with a lot of colourful lighting especially at the marina bay area, the food court was in great design of the 60s/70s.",,,
,,Better at night.,4,,"I've been to Singapore Flyer for two times, the first time is during daytime, and the other time is at night. My advice is you'd better visit at night and take a nice shot of Singapore Night, I think the scenery during daytime isn't quite attracting.",,,
,,Must do activity for all in their itinerary,4,,"Awesome view, systematic way of entering to a capsule for a ride. You can view Indonesia and Malaysian island from Singapore flyer.",,,
,,boring,5,,"nothing special unless you want to do the tourist thing in singapore but better off spending your time elsewhere I think i fell asleep halfway through the ride

good views but you can get them on most any high-rise restaurant/bar in Singapore that isnt half as boring",,,
,,Blah.,3,,"Great views but it's a little slow and boring for smaller kids. About 10 minutes into the circle, my kids were ""bored"".",,,
,,Not Sure Whether Value for Money,3,,"We are around 14 to 15 of us who went together to the flyer, so we had a complete cubicle and tour guide for us. The ride was for around 15 to 20 minutes and it gave an arial view of the city from all sides, was beautiful sight but very short trip. The ride should have been at least for 45 to 60 minutes as then one gets to see the same once with commentary of the guide and one without probably. Easy to access and food and beverages available at the venue.
In case on a short visit, can do the flyer and get complete view and understanding of the city. I found the price slightly on the higher end keeping in mind the duration of the trip.",,,
,,Nice ride..,4,,"We come on early morning flight... They have little museum to get know it before we ride... Not much people in when we are there so the whole tube just us which is nice... View is quite okay just u get bored fast.. But my family enjoy it very much the ride..

Souvenir sold is quite expensive so we just buy the pic taken before we ride. Photo souvenir in Singapore attraction are very expensive compare to other country.",,,
,,A Must in Singapore,5,,"We visited within hours of arriving at our hotel, as we could see the Flyer from hour room, and it was a great way to stretch the legs after the long flight. It was also an experionce to see the surrounds at night, all lit up. The lighting show put on by a number of the hotels in the area, and particularly the Marina area was awesome.
It also allowed me to find the F1 Grand prix track, and as my partner and I are avid followers, it was an unexpected highlight on our first night. Highly recommended.",,,
,,High Flyer,5,,This is a super way to see a great portion of Singapore from the air. I was concerned the height may bother me but it moves so slowly and is so large it wasn't a problem at all. The dining car looked very romantic.,,,
,,excellent,5,,"The views were excellent,you can see a lot of Singapore and to get on the flyer it was very quick. The Singapore flyer is 30 metres higher then the London Eye ,the weather always cloudy and the humidity terrible.",,,
,,It was a experience to view Singapore,5,,Good giant flyer where we can see the view of complete Singapore. We can take pictures from the top view which is superb.,,,
,,Great sights from a good view,4,,A good day that started off overcast that cleared up with sun brightening up the city during midday. Surprised there was a seawall and the gardens by the bay was beautiful from so high above. Definitely a good view of the city and the sea.,,,
,,View from outside.,4,,"On the penultimate day of our visit to Singapore, we went to this place with great enthusiasm. To our bad luck the weather was inclement with dark clouds looming in the sky. Since it was also hazy, we decided to take a look from outside and clicked pictures of the same.

We suggest that visitors choose a day with clear skies for enjoying this attraction",,,
,,fantastic views,4,,the wheel was bigger than I imagined as were the cabins...when the whell was at the highest extremity one could see for miles..fantastic..the ride was not long enough tho...,,,
,,Great attraction especially if you travel with someone who has limitation on long walking,4,,"I visited Singapore Flyer on Friday evening. It wasnt crowded and very comfortable to bring infant. Stroller and wheelchair friendly, they even let you keep the stroller at front when visit the ""short gallery"" beneath the flyer. The gallery was so-so to me. Mostly it tells you the history about the flyer itself.

Each capsules can take 20 ish passangers, but they never overcrowd the capsule, so we can have enough space to walk around in capsule and take beautiful pics. I saw 2 elderly couple having the capsule all to themselve while they just sit side by side enjoying the view. Love the scene!

The view from above was great, i love city view, marina view, garden by the bay and sea view. Maybe the view at night will give different impression, with city lights and all. Pricewise, it may be a little on expensive side, but if they use it for maintenance I dont mind at all. Like my motto. Always try everything at least once..

I didnt try other attraction within the premises, so cant give my review. I did check their website first before visiting the site, it was very informative.",,,
,,Loved it!,5,,"Amazing views of the city. Well worth the cost of the ride and good to get your bearings. When I went it was uncrowned, clean and efficient. No queuing.",,,
,,Ride is over before you knew it,3,,"Each capsule about the size of a bus can fit in quite a number of people. Depending on the day you go there the wait to hop onto the capsule should not take that long especially since it's not that popular these days. Photo taking moments are available from all around but after a while you will get bored as there are only so much to see.

Before you know it the ride is over and as usual before you get out of the place you will have to walk through a gift shop.",,,
,,Fabulous views of a wonderful city!,5,,we visited the Flyer around 5 pm on a lovely sunny evening and no queues. The capsules are large and allow sufficient space for everyone to move around to catch panoramic views - dont miss it!,,,
,,"Been there, done that, got a photo",4,,"An okay experience with great views of the bay and beyond. We got to share our ride with a 5 year old who thought that she was a bird; her parents thought she was cute - I'd just rather have opened a window and let her fly.
Back to the review...at $33 a little expensive but an experience worth doing at least once",,,
,,Great attaction. Just not for me,5,,"I would rather take a helicopter tour. But short of that, this is a must do in London and Singapore , never been in Austria so I can't talk about it.
In Singapore as everything else. It is clean well organized safe. What can I say without being too jealous. Singapore is probably on all accounts the greatest Disney country in the world, if you like Disneyland that is. I love New York.",,,
,,Superb,5,,"Have now been on this twice. It is a little expensive, but well worth at least one visit to have a look at the stunning skyline that is Singapore",,,
,,"so smooth, not at all scary with fabulous views",5,,"It cost $33. Each to have a 30 Minute ride on the 165 metre high ferrous wheel and worth every penny. My husband has a real fear of heights but he found this attraction""an easy thing to do""and very enjoyable. We would highly recommend it as a great way to see the city and Bay.",,,
,,Fun ride,4,,"Was not the best weather, had to wait an hour as there had been lightning. The ride was fun & saw quite a lot - think the views might have been better on a clearer day 鈥?",,,
,,You can skip this...,3,,"we just saw this place from the outside. its highly priced. it take around 40 mins for a complete rotation... its very slow and boring.... if u are an adventorous person, it becomes too boring...",,,
,,amazing view,4,,The carriages are pretty big and roomy... and gives an amazing view of the whole singapore city around you covered by water all around... a must go for all travellers to singapore,,,
,,Full on waste of time. .,2,,Only for the view you have to sit in this slow giant wheel for about 30 minutes. . I had been there in the day light... so I didn't even find tge view such great..,,,
,,Do it!,5,,Absolutely wonderful views of the city and an amazing experience. You have to do this! We went during the day and it was fantastic - I am sure the night view would be very spectacular.,,,
,,Geat view of Singapore,5,,"Beautiful view of Singapore. You can see Marina Bay Sands, Singapore financial district, the flower dome, all the ships, gardens by the bay and so much more, its a great view, absolutely amazing, would recommend the Singapore Flyer for everyone!",,,
,,If you have seen Singapore from other heights then nothing special here,3,,"There are various avenues in Singapore to provide a view from a good height. If you have already seen the Singapore skyline from a significant height from some other point then there is nothing special in Singapore Flyer. But if Flyer is your first experience for Singapore skyline then you should try it.
I gave an average rating, as I had observed Singapore from heights in different locations, so I did not find something special while going into the Flyer.
You can buy tickets from window, I did not encounter any large queue there. The path which led you to your flight capsule is meticulously designed in a form of a museum providing history and technique of Singapore Flyer. Interesting to see familiar Mathematics and Physics principles in practice, of course there were complexities which I did not understand.
Flyer takes a round in about 40-45 minutes. The flyer capsule is enclosed all around glass, so it gives a 360 degree view of Singapore. At the location of Flyer is at prominent point, Marina Bay, therefore the views presented are spectacular.
It has its own advantages in day or on night time, however, in my opinion, evening/night time provides a better view with all illuminations. If your timing coincides with Marina Bay laser show, then you can view it from Flyer capsule.
At the base of the Flyer, is a food court. This food court has various stalls serving world cuisine. For Indian travelers, there is a stall for Indian food as well. The overall theme is of a hawker food court however rates are not in that league, its slightly overpriced in comparison to other hawker markets.
To reach Flyer, the nearest MRT is Bay Front. From there, it will take 5-10 minutes walk to reach the flyer ticket counter.
So the conclusion is, if you have not seen Singapore from a significant height already then you must try out flyer, otherwise you may skip it.",,,
,,Just WOW- A must see,5,,"I liked the fact that I had a ""cabin"" for myself / family , no stranger, although weather was very hot, but a/c in the cabin was excellent, service and welcoming of staff was nice, the lady at the ticket counter offered us a family package instead of solo tickets to save money, we enjoyed the ride indeed and the view was spictacular",,,
,,Singapore Flyer Revisited,5,,"Once again on an early morning visit during a recent sojourn in Singapore we absolutely marvelled at the cityscape sights visible from the 'Flyer'. It was some 3 years since the last visit and views from the Flyer highlighted many changes since that time, not the least of which is the new Marina Bay Cruise Terminal nearby. The Flyer offers a relatively cheap attraction for visitors, and of course any adverse weather would tend to mar the experience. Hence we opt for an early morning weekday visit - the chance of better, clearer, weather, and fewer other patrons, so more chance for a gondola by ourselves.",,,
,,Singapore View from Sky High,3,,Singapore Flyer is definitely one time affair for first time visitor of Singapore. Exciting experience...... but not to repeat it for next time visit considering cost .......you have other better places to revisit again and again such as universal studio etc. ...... Enjoy Singapore..........I call it a beautiful fun city.,,,
,,A memorable ride of a life time,5,,"Singapore flyer is a unique way to view the city. It is a 30 min ride in a AC glass cylinder like view area. The ride goes slowly at 2 km per second and one full round takes nearly half hour. Its fully made of steel and glass. Once on the top u can see the Marina bay, marina bay sands hotel, the merlion, f1 tracks. The building also houses many shops and spa and lots of food courts in the ground floor. U can see as far till malayasia once we reach the top. A must when u visit singapore.
Tip. spend some time in the koi pond below the flyer for some peaceful time",,,
,,Very nice view for enjoy,5,,Have a big place and have a nice view. If you wanted to go I recommend you to go with your friends or your family. And I recommend you to go in the evening or at night because at night you can see Singapore's beautiful lights. And If you go to the top of it you will can see the whole Singapore island that was surrounded by the sea. You can enjoy it in 30 minutes. And when you come down it also have a souvenir shop.,,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"No queues, pod to ourselves, terminal itself is beautiful, lovely restaurants and gardens. Amazing views. Very smooth. I don't like heights but couldn't miss this. If in Singapore a must do !",,,
,,"This is a ""must do"" in Singapore",5,,"Yesterday was cloudy - before the best thunder and lighning storm of all time - but we grabbed the opportunity to go up in the Singapore Flyer. What a wonderful experience - 30 minutes. The carriages are very large and the most people we saw in one carriage were eight adults (ours), so there is plenty of room to sit or walk around. Glass all around. Singapore is very proud that their flyer is higher than the London Eye! What a view. SGD33 and worth every cent. Absolutely highly recommended",,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"I am scared of heights :) But when we got on the flyer it was really good and there was a sense of security.
The entrance was amazing because the details of the flyer construction was available in different modalities pictures, diagrams etc.
The height at top was 160metres and the view was just excellent. We were there during the daytime and the weather was clear and sunny so the view was awesome.
below was the Formula 1 Grand prix circuit and we saw all the places we had isited before from a Birdseye view.
When you leave the cabin there is this lovely garden and there was a place where you could eat and drink fresh juices, must try.
I think I will visit Singapore again but for a longer period and not on business but rather on holidays.",,,
,,Good view of singapore,4,,Its' a giant Ferris wheel. Go in the evening when Singapore is lit up. Good view of singapore. Price was around S$33.00.,,,
,,amazing way view all of th city,5,,"I enjoyed a lot, nice views amazing at night with city lights. You won't miss it will see flyer for far distance, from far you can't tell if it's moving or not but riding in it makes you feel it's moving fast. I Loved it.",,,
,,A Worth visiting ride,4,,30 minutes ride on this flyer gives you a complete picture of Singapore. You can view the major islands. Good experience for photograph lovers. But do take care of not taking the ride when it's raining. You would simply land up wasting your money,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"Good but not excellent. Visibility is the key to good photography and sadly the tropics do suffer from a dearth of clear air. That said, the Flyer is accessible, reasonably priced and offers a good view of the city. Avoid a gondola with children: it will be a miserable experience otherwise.",,,
,,good view,3,,"not a big fan of height, so i thought it was the longest 30 mins of my life. though the kids enjoyed the ride a lot. nice view from up there, but nothing else to do. just one of that once in a lifetime thing.",,,
,,Awesome view from the top,4,,Go for a very thrilling and awesome view from the top. Very similar to the London eye. Bit expensive in comparison to other attractions.,,,
,,All flowers of the world!,4,,The whole structure was like a fairyland. When i visited a fairy tail theme was maintained. tulips of all colors was there. Tulips and daises and the fairy tail set ups gave me a surreal feeling.,,,
,,What a view,5,,This was a true highlight of our stay in Singapore. A huge ferris wheel which gave you an excellent view of the entire city. Being such a clean city it was like you were on top of the world.,,,
,,A good way to introduce yourself to Singapore,4,,This can be regarded as your tour of Singapore or a good start to getting your bearings for later exploration. An on/off bus about $22 AUD per person. Upstairs and downstairs. There is the usual headphone/tape talk as you travel around.,,,
,,Great view,5,,"It is the largest ferris wheel in the world. Moves so slowly that to look far seems to be stopped. Is very close to the Formula 1 track and pit stop, for those who like is an attraction. But the best is the view, breathtaking.",,,
,,Impressive Ride & Views,5,,"I arrived early at the flyer , about 09.00am .Sharing a capsule with another guy. The views were very impressive , looking east you can see the new sports stadium , in the distance ships waiting at anchor. North you can see the golden domes of the Sultan Mosque. A really enjoyable experience.",,,
,,Great view of the city,4,,"Singapore Flyer is Singapore's Observation wheel. It gives you a very good overview of the city. The duration of the ""flight"" is reasonable. Exit is via the inevitable gift shop.",,,
,,Great views,4,,We went during day time and enjoyed good views.The attraction is very well managed.Would have been helpful if there was a map explaining what we were looking at.Definately worth a visit.Combine it with the Gardens by the bay.,,,
,,Awesome Experience,4,,"This is one of its kind of experience which you might get elsewhere (Ex.London, I guess), a slowly moving fully enclosed cabin with all around glass enclosure, breathtaking view of the Singapore City.. Dont miss to take the Photo by their staffs before boarding the flyer...you will be surprised with the photo results...",,,
,,A must to enjoy the view,4,,"I've done this in Jan 2014.
I would say this is one of the important attractions when visiting Singapore even with a very short visit. Have the camera ready for as many pictures as possible but also keep it aside to enjoy the view. We have done it in the late afternoon and enjoyed it. I'm sure visiting at night would have a different feeling.
It was very interesting to me to see the very very very busy Singapore port from the top. It makes you realize how much this city have developed from almost nothing.",,,
,,Amazing View!,4,,"Its a brilliant ride that takes half an hour to complete. You can see a beautiful view of Singapore. If you are in Singapore, you cannot miss the Singapore flyer.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer in Style!,4,,"Chose to book a ""High Tea"" experience on the Singapore Flyer. The afternoon was cloudy but the ""style"" of the High Tea and the attention of the staff member during the ""flight"" made up for the weather. Sharing the experience with other travellers added to the fun. Worth doing while in Singapore.",,,
,,Singapore eye,4,,See all the islands of Singapore and capture the whole Singapore in one go. A must watch in Singapore and recommended to visit at the beginning of the trip so as to have an overall view of Singapore.,,,
,,Slow ride but great view,4,,The ride was slow but very stable. it was able to bring us to a very good height where we had a great view of the area. We could spend time taking photos.,,,
,,Amazing view,4,,"It definitively nice to see Singapore for the top of the flyer. The cabin is comfortable (with air conditioning) and the windows are big enough.
The dinner is ok but don鈥檛 expect too much. The food must be reserved in advance and the choice of beverage is limited.
The food is prepared in advance (as per your pre-order) and heated up once you are seated.",,,
,,Awesome Singapore View,5,,The 30 min ride on the Singapre Flyer makes you have a birds eye look over Singapore.Plan it in the night to have a night view too.I think 6:30 might be the best time,,,
,,Go for the photo opportunity!,5,,"The Flyer is a great platform for some awesome photography. The complete circuit takes about 30 minutes and is the ideal place to relax and enjoy with family or friends, engage in a bit of banter, take lots (and lots!) of pics and soak in the great views. The cabins are spacious and have a bench to sit on too. In case you do not want to get stuck with a group, do opt to wait for the next cabin- because if you're stuck with an unruly crowd, it'll ruin the experience!",,,
,,Don't miss this opportunity,5,,"The flyer is well worth its entrance fee, we were lucky enough to have a pod to our self, which seemed on this day same for everyone. You get an amazing view of the city and further, we could see over to Indonesia and into Malaya. Another bonus it is air conditioned.
Plenty of shops cafes and other amenities are in the building next to the flyer.",,,
,,The view,5,,"Costly, for less time, but worth it. Amazing, breathtaking view of whole of Singapore. Just like the London Eye. Everything looks just amazing. Wonderful opportunity to capture some of the great sights, be it the Marina Bay Sands or the football ground in the mid of water or the garden or anything else.",,,
,,Sky Journey,4,,"From across Singapore, the sight which greets you from any direction is the Flyer. Standing majestically it moves at a steady pace and gives the best panaromic view of this splendid city and its architecture around.
The best time to visit is pre sunset when you can get the view of day/night with the sinking sun in the background giving a memorable sight.
Just watching it at night as it glows with lights in darkness is a feast to the eyes. The cabins are huge and very safe and secure. The amazing journey is for about 30 min but worth its cost.
There are lots of eateries around and the walk from the Flyer to the Arts/Science museum across is just too good. Have a great photogenic time of life !",,,
,,Great views.,4,,The Singapore flyer provides magnificent views over Singapore. The cabins are spacious and comfortable and afford 360 degree photographic opportunities.,,,
,,A most do for excellent views of the city and coast!,4,,"This was very well organised, the timing is good and the position of the wheel to give excellent views is very good. You get to see everything from where the F1 starts to the marina, the city buildings, the ships coming in and out of Singapore are amazing you get a good feel for the city at this height, very good!",,,
,,Amazing Views,4,,We decided to go to this at night and we weren't disappointed. Make sure that you do know the area and therefore are able to identify landmarks. The flyer is easy to get to and we booked our tickets on line and picked them up on arrival. Enjoyed the 1/2 an hour ride and the views were stunning.,,,
,,Birthday Trip,4,,"This is well worth visiting although I felt like the security checks before going on were more than at the airport. However, the views are stunning. If you get the chance and want to eat - make sure you book well in advance.",,,
,,Loved the time spent here!,5,,"Singapore is like a dream country. Everything around is so fascinating, great cars, tall buildings, excellent infrastructure. Singapore Flyer is no different. The 30-40 minutes spent in the flyer were totally worth the time spent there. Also, the area around the flyer is excellent just to sit by and relax. Its so soothing to sit in the gardens around and witness daily life. Also, there is the F1 circuit going around the flyer. Must visit for anyone in Singapore - else you're missing out something huge. Also, you can see the entire city from the flyer and its beautiful. If you can, DO VISIT IT AT NIGHT! We did it and we loved it! Also, there are lots of restaurants around and you can find plenty variety of food.",,,
,,Amazing views of a fantastic area,4,,"I loved the trip around the Flyer. Takes a little bit longer than I needed to get some photos and enjoy the view, but we had a pod to ourselves on a quiet day and that was brilliant. Easy to access on the hop on buses",,,
,,Spectacular view.,4,,The view on the city center and on the sea is spectacular. The wheel turns quite slow though and in the end you start thinking that it would be good to go down faster.,,,
,,Definitely include this in your itinerary!,4,,"We hadn't intended to do this as so many other cities have similar attractions. However, we found ourselves near the venue and, after having a very nice lunch at the street vendors markets that sits underneath, we thought what the heck and decided to hop on. Plus it was very quiet when we there (around mid afternoon). The wheel rotates very slowly so getting on and off is simple, and consequently it means you get ample time to soak up all the sights. You really do get to see the whole of Singapore, and the proximity to the Gardens By The Bay means you get particularly good views of that. Definitely worth a visit and lots of photo opportunities.",,,
,,Worlds largest Wheel Flyer,4,,"This one is largest flyer. Its nearer to the Marina Bay. You can walk from the Merlion Park(Lion Statue). Around 2-3 km, and then you can reach flyer. The arrangement is very nice. It has airport like checking. Singpore town has very nice view from here. Only aspect is price is could be less. Otherwise its a must see for tourist.",,,
,,Stay at the Marina Bay Sands and avoid the queuing + poor product + photo,1,,"Singapore Flyer was the world's tallest ferris wheel. Price range is excessive expensive (SGD$33/adult) for 30 minutes ride and being 165m off the ground. Furthermore, there are no commentary or hand out document whatsoever available for the customers.
At night, it was such a disappointment to find dusks, greasy/oily marks and fingerprints all over the windows in the cabin. For that price, windows should be cleaned.",,,
,,very good experience..!,4,,Singapore flyer is the must place If visit to this country. It's a 30 minutes joyful experience when you get the birds eye view of the places around. Whole place is managed by the expert and courteous staff. Don't forget to carry your camera to capture good views.,,,
,,Great Singapore Flyer Experience,5,,Singapore Flyer is one of a kind! Seeing Singapore view in the evening was breathtaking...You won't feel that it's movimg because you are enjoying the scenery and trying to get the best angles in every side of the tube. It was relaxing and you can really see that everyone was enjoying the ride.,,,
,,Good but overpriced,3,,"This was an experience everyone should do however we were disappointed that for $33 each and only 10 or so people waiting to get on - we were put in a bubble with a family with a screaming toddler.

The experience would have been so much better if we were on our own or in a cabin with other adults without children.",,,
,,Wow what a view,5,,What a fantastic experience this is. make sure you put this on your must do list. What a great experience. Makes for a great dayout.,,,
,,Great View!!,4,,Nice experience with great view of the city. Its nicely placed so that you can get a fuller view of the city. Must visit!!,,,
,,So high..,5,,"One of the most favorite spot for traveller. it's so high and amazing.. you can see clearly the marina bay sands, merlion etc. but not recommended for the acrophobia / fear of height.",,,
,,Flyer,5,,This is very comparable to the London eye. Quick and easy to get on and off and great views in the half hour trip.,,,
,,Good experience with great view,4,,It is recommended to visit the singapore flyer in the beginning of your trip to take an overall look at singapore and have some ideas as to what you would like to see later on. The flyer is slow enough to take good pictures yet it is not boring. During your visit you can find papers indicating the important sightseeings you will be seeing from up above.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"What can I say , excellent views and great value for money, a brilliant way to get out the sun fir 30 minutes with the fully air conditioned capsules.",,,
,,Great views!,5,,I love to hit the high point in cities for the overall views and the Flyer was perfect. There was almost no line to get on and the capsule I was on had like four people. It takes about a half hour to make the circuit and even gave me a chance to map out my walking route to the Marina Bay Sands where I was able to get the subway back to my hotel.,,,
,,Excellent Views..,4,,"Experience an almost bird's eye view of the Siingapore skyline! Weekends can get a little crowded. We opted to go at sunset and really enjoyed this. You can see the Singapore skyline lit up with the Gardens by the Bay on one side, F1 pits and the Marina Bay Sands on the other. Great views all round!",,,
,,Highest Wheel in the world,4,,"It was the highest wheel in the world when we were there in January 2015, so the view was brilliant and the weather was cloudy when we got in but by the time we reached the top the sun had come out and we could see for miles.",,,
,,High price for high views,4,,"The views from here are great, but cost us $66 for two and lasted just under half an hour. Same views as marina bay sands and taking a family works out very expensive. Worth it if you love scenic views though",,,
,,Worth the visit!!,5,,"We had a blast at the Singapore Flyer! I would suggest going during the evening to take in some breathtaking views. This is a major tourist area and there is more to enjoy in this area than just the Flyer. While we waited for the sun to go down we enjoyed a fish pedicure. There is a bar, restaurants and shopping at this location. I would definitely go again.",,,
,,Night or Day,5,,Wonderful opportunity to take some great city scapes or Marina Bay. I went in the day time....big crowds even then but the views at night must be spectacular.,,,
,,Glad we did it!,4,,"The Flyer is a great activity to take in for all ages. It is set-up along the order of a Disney attraction. You wind around through hallways and holding areas that provide opportunity to read and observe information about the Singapore Flyer. Most of the waiting area is air conditioned. Staff were very kind and attentive to safety, which is important when you arrive at the loading zone. The view is magnificent! We got some great pictures. Highly recommend this attraction, though the admission price is rather steep. Not too bad for one or two, but for a family of 4-6 is would be very pricey.",,,
,,An experience of its own kind !,4,,"It would take you initially some time to figure out if it's actually moving ! It moves at such a slow pace ! But once you're inside the capsule at the top, you wish it moved even more slowly ! Such is the fun element it offers ! Avoid going on it during rains though as the foggy air might block some of your stunning views !",,,
,,Not worth the price,3,,I visited here with my Singapore Airline Explorer Pass so it was included. If I had to pay the $28 for the 30 min ride then it's really not worth the admission. The view was spectacular but that was about it. I think there are much more interesting places in Singapore to spend your time.,,,
,,Wow!!!!,5,,"Just.... Wow! Tallest observation wheel in the world and when you at the top, you're literally on top of the world!",,,
,,Bird's eye view,5,,"The flyer seems to give you a birds view touring the entire singapore, the flyer gives a view which is as far as seeing around 20 islands around the city. It consists of capsules that can take a capacity of 28 in each.",,,
,,View to singapore,4,,Whole singapore can be seen far till the sea from this flyer. It feels very good when you are at such a height at such an amazing place and just enjoying the view.,,,
,,"A bit pricey, plenty of other options to see the same view",3,,"The Flyer was a bit disappointing, I have to admit. It is very tall and there's a nice view from the top, I give it that. But if you've spent a few days in Singapore and already seen the Marina Bay area, it really does not add that much value. The experience for us visitors could be greatly improved with some basic information on the buildings and the cityscape you are looking at. But that is left for you to find out yourself. Go if you have extra time and/or S$'s or travelling with kids.",,,
,,10 Stories Higher than London Eye,5,,"It claims to be 10 stories higher than London Eye and they are very proud of it.
It's a very calm and peaceful ride, takes 28 Min, they say 28 is lucky number and one should wish for good luck when you are at the top...

nice one.",,,
,,Great at night,3,,"Duration is very fast. We went at night near closing time on a weekday and people are already manageable. Expect rude capsule mates, and bring food because most of them do anyways. Hard to locate and travel to from the city so plan your journey. No valuable establishments around, not even a convenience store. City is bright and beautiful to look at night, take pictures and sit by the glass windows. Book online and print ticket to avoid hassle and make it a weekday if possible because Singapore is overcrowded as hell.",,,
,,Excellent,5,,"My wife and i did the Flyer at 9.30 am and had a capsule to ourselves. Excellent service, excellent views, and well worth the experience. We got best views of the city from this compared to other structures. We recommend this attraction.",,,
,,Brilliant attraction!,5,,My son & I really enjoyed the Singapore Flyer and thought it was well worth the money. We bought our tickets on line before we arrived in Singapore and this was an easy way of avoiding any queue for tickets. Having said that we went in the morning and there was nobody there. We had a cubicle to ourselves and one other person so you could move around the cubicle without anyone getting in your way of photos etc. It takes about 30 mins to get right around and the view is fantastic. I can imagine it gets crowded in the evening but the morning view was just as good.,,,
,,Great service and great view but waste of time when the weather is bad,3,,"The differences between the regular and the premium pass is the premium will give you singapore sling (somekind of cocktail) during your flight and i think the premium capsule have a music you can enjoy during the flight, also you don't have to wait for the long queue because the lane is different from the regular.

When I visit singapore, the weather is bad, it keeps on raining and it really ruins your itenary, because the singapore flyer won't run for your own safety during lightning or heavy rain. I have to wait about 2 hours untill the rain stop.
So I suggest don't buy the ticket far from the day you'll visit (like online), because you don't know the weather will be bad or sunny. Better to buy it on that day you plan to visit.",,,
,,鈥淭he scariest 30 minutes of my life!鈥?3.0,,"If you are afraid of heights 鈥?this is a NEVER DO attraction for you.

We did the tour at late afternoon and found the cost reasonable for an attraction of this standard. The sign posting and venue is very easy to navigate through. Let me just say that I did not realise that I was afraid of heights until I attended this attraction. I visited with my husband, son and my friend with her two children. They all certainly did enjoy the views and the smooth ride of the glass capsule. Me on the other hand, spent 20 minutes on the floor with my legs crossed and head in my lap. The first and last five minutes of the ride you can handle, but if you are afraid of enclosed spaces or heights, be aware that once you are in the capsule you will remain in the capsule for 30 long, heart pounding, sweaty palms, mind blowing minutes!

I am told that the views from the whole circle of views are amazing and the photo opportunities are awesome. You are able to stand within the capsule and take photos with you in fore ground and the views of Singapore in the background or just photos of the views. You can even do selfies.

They also do a sunset dinner ride 鈥?not something that I could ever see myself doing.

I must say from my point of view these memories will last a life time!",,,,
,,Worth to pay a visit,4,,"Singapore flyer is worth to visit. Expect long queue in the evening (during sun set). The cable car ride took around 20 minutes, but you must spent some time on a small exhibit before boarding the flyer. The cabin is 9 mtr wide and 3 or 3.5 mtr wide. Ride is suitable for any age group. it is the best place to enjoy the scenic singapore from the top. It is beter than London Eye considering the following a) Cabins are wider/broader b) Singapore looks more scenic than London",,,
,,average,3,,if u have been to london eye then its doesnt look that great... but for first timers its an enjoyment... u can also go late at night to see illuminated singapore...,,,
,,great view of the city at night,5,,i went with my family in the evening and the wheel gets pretty high up in the sky. Beautiful view of the entire city!! Good food options below before you take the wheel.,,,
,,okay..,3,,We went during the day and it was drizzling... i think night time might be the best.. However the view of the city was pretty awesome specially Marina Bay Sands,,,
,,if u have time then go for it,4,,33 dollars ticket not a bad way to see the whole singapore from the top roughly takes 30-40 minutes for the whole round,,,
,,Must experience for tourists,5,,"This is a half an hour ride where in you get a birds eye view of Singapore. From outside when you see the height of the wheel, it will look as if the ride is going to be thrilling and a little scary. In real it is neither of these since each compartment is quite big and a lot of people will be there with you.
But the view is absolutely breath taking. We took it in the night, and the view of the lighted highways and buildings was brilliant. They say that the view in the day time in different, but equally good.

It was expensive at the price tag of SGD 33 per person. In spite of that, i would say it is a must do thing if you are a tourist in Singapore.",,,
,,Good View...!,5,,"Well, it's a wheel thingy so you would get a good view wouldnt you! The Boeing 737 flight simulator is worth it too if you are a plane nerd, $300SIN for an hour a $20 for a DVD of your efforts.",,,
,,Excellent view,5,,No wait time. Arrived and went straight through. Excellent view very clean and informative. Buy your tickets as part of a package to get better value for money,,,
,,City View,3,,Good to have a complete city view from the flyer. We visited ther at night and found the whole city sparkling like a star.,,,
,,Waste of time and money,1,,"Compared to other ""wheels"" around the world this is the worst. It is slow and the lack of commentary makes it an expensive boring 30 mins!
Much better to go to another high point in the city and do a 360 turn you will see the same view quick for less money!",,,
,,Beautiful view,5,,"I caught the river boat to the flyer and was dropped off just by the F1 race track. In fact I actually stepped on the rubber left by Lewis Hamilton, well I think it was him. The flyer like most places in Singapore has air con and gives fantastic views of the land reclaimed and built on. A must visit for anyone new to Singapore.",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,Trip last a around 35 minutes. A great view of Singapore skyline. Great for photo taking. Didn't have to queue. Cost was reasonable.,,,
,,Amazing,5,,"You want to see Singapore city, skyline from Singapore flyer offers the most amazing view of the city.We took a night ride we were awed at how beautiful city looks, the ride is almost half an hour but its huge long and makes you go awww. The expense is just a small part but ride I felt was worth it if you haven't done a flyer ride ever before.The glass cubicle has some seating in the middle but I was hardly sitting looking at the night time bright city.I felt I got more ideas of my dinner place just seeing the fun things I could do at the last ride at the flyer.We did not go to the eating place build around the flyer but surely had fun browsing around.

if I would have my way, would love to build a digital kiosk on the glass itself to show you all the beautiful places you can see from the flyer.

If you are a romantic type I wouldn't mind spending a bit for having dinner on the flyer itself.",,,
,,Stunning!,5,,"It is very new, with each compartment of the flyer very spacious. The view outside is absolutely stunning! Blue sky, clear green and blue water with beautiful modern constructions of this city state. I would say that it is a must go!",,,
,,Even on a rainy day it was nice!,5,,"We had the tickets from the SQ stopover programme, which is excellent value. This ride gives you a great view over the city!",,,
,,Awfully expensive but worth a visit if weather is fine,4,,"4 stars only considering the price - Be sure to avoid weekends (queues) - Only if the weather is fine and if there is no smog - Great views from the top - Price is very expensive, be prepared - We were lucky, no queue and alone in a capsule - A message to the management: Considering the price, capsule windows should be cleaned from time to time, and/or consider giving a basic cleaning kit for the inside, so that one could take unblurred pictures, thank you",,,
,,Great way to take in the view,4,,"Air conditioned comfort as you travel the 30 minute circuit that the flyer takes. It is a great way to take in the view over the city and bay.
It was a bit on the expensive side, but worth it. Night time would be great too.",,,
,,Thank you for the Wonderful experience,5,,"We had a great experience here! Bought a ticket for 2 at the ticket office below the Singapore flyer and then we queue up to get inside the showroom. This showroom or entrance will give you some information about the flyer. Then it's our turn for a fun ride. I thought it's gonna be scary as it is moving but I didn't feel scared at all. Probably because it only move too slow that you didn't even notice your moving until you reach the top then you realize your too far away from the ground already. Then from there you can see the amazing scenery of Singapore, tall nice buildings, the beach, the park, everything you can see it clearly. The space is huge so you can actually move around, move to different spot to get a good view of the city. It's amazing and I really enjoyed it! Took lots of photos. I recommend you to try it and chose the sunset timing like 6:30 to 7pm. The view of the city is spectacular.",,,
,,Go at night!,5,,We opted to go at night and really enjoyed this. You can see the Singapore skyline lit up as well as the Supertree Grove in Gardens by the Bay. You can also look down into the F1 pits. Great views all round.,,,
,,Jewelled crown of Singapore!,4,,"The first look of it is like a giant wheel, which is too expensive for the time that you spend. But once you decide to take it up (which I would recommend every traveller to do it), your perception will change completely. The flyer is best enjoyed in the evening. It will give you an amazing, lighted and decked up Singapore city. From the flyer you will get a marvellous view of the architecture of the city. It is a must for all the travellers, so don鈥檛 miss it. And ensure that you do it in the late evening.",,,
,,Felt bored,2,,We were very excited to see singapore from flyer but it's different story their. The actual direction of rotation has to be opposite.the initial rotation has view of sea that's boring in night. After 20 min the view is towards the modern singapore by the time we lose our excitement. And the views here are too far to see by naked eye. The outside videos displays were not working. Though it's in prime place it's difficult to reach their through public transport it requires little walking if ur coming from little india overall the ride was not too great and ur sure to get bored in it,,,
,,Great views!,5,,Like: perhaps you need to go around twice. the first round is just to soak in the views and the second time is to take pictures. Better go to the flyer in the morning when there were not many tourists yet.,,,
,,From the sky,4,,Give it a try to have the best look of Singapore from all corners. Preferably go in the night to enjoy the rays of light .,,,
,,Great view,5,,"It's a must do, we went there during the day but I'd like to do it again at night time. Offers a great view on a clear day.",,,
,,It was average,3,,It was ok as compared to London eye.. view was quite nyc but waiting time is toooooo longg... But there are many offers to date in the singapore flyer with you loved one... this was the thing about it.. .,,,
,,"slightly boring, and mediocre food street",3,,"the 45 min on the flyer can get slightly boring because you only see water and the CBD, but good to go if you have time and a good camera.

food street at ground level has many choices, but quality is not as good as at local hawker centres, and prices are slightly higher.",,,
,,Another great view,4,,We did this in the evening and the view is fantastic. It does go quickly though with a single rotation only taking 30 minutes,,,
,,Well worth it!,5,,Enjoy a fabulous view of Singapore from the Flyer. I talked my son into going as he thought it would not be very exciting but he was very glad I did! On previous trips we had done boat trips and in my opinion this is a far better experience. The view is fantastic. Just make sure the weather is going to be OK. Maybe choose the morning rather than the afternoon as Singapore often gets large thunderstorms then. For those afraid of heights there is very little sensation at all of being so high.,,,
,,Different perspective of Singapore,5,,"Being afraid of heights I was unsure how this would go, but as its an extremely smooth trip and the sky line is amazing, it went well. From this vantage point you can see the whole island, ships in the bay, people going about their daily life - its a pretty cool birds eye view.",,,
,,Nothing infront of London Eye,3,,"If you have visited the London Eye, then singapore flyer is nothing infront of it. The capsules are not good aesthetically. Also no information ipads available in the capsule as they are in the london eye capsule. But still if you are in singapore do visit this once.",,,
,,Luxury flight with emaculate views,5,,"Very efficient, very safe, lovely views. I took my daughter on the flyer for her 10th birthday and handed her gift to her in the air. It is something she will be talking about for years to come. Younger kids love the excitement. Our older folks enjoyed the relaxing views from up there.",,,
,,Immaculate views...,5,,"I loved this attraction. I went on a less busy day and at a less busy time. The car was largely empty and I could move around changing sides, perspectives and snapping new vistas. This is the world's tallest wheel structure so it is must see when you visit Singapore. I was truly blown away, as were my family when they could see all the digital photos afterwards.",,,
,,Nice Experience.,4,,Its a nice experience for a ride in the flyer. Go in the evening so that you get a nice view of Singapore. Kids will like it.,,,
,,Stunning,5,,A stunning view of Singapore from the flyer you can see. The structure is similar to London eye. The overall experience is worth.,,,
,,Great value - and superb vistas,5,,Amazing value for money and a chance to see across the bay and get great views of the city. One of the highest points at 165m above sea level.,,,
,,Beautiful view from the top!,4,,"A great experience. One of the places tourists must visit. The place is big, so be careful when travelling with family.

Everything was great except the toilet. It was terrible, even to look. Wet, lack of tissue paper and other issues. Be prepared if you're going there, especially with family. Best not to use the toilet. It will be a worthwhile experience, believe me.",,,
,,Beautiful 360 views,4,,Nice 30mins flight in a shared capsule. Will definitely book dinner next time. Lovely views of the city and marina bay.,,,
,,Great View by Day.,4,,We were lucky enough to have a gondola to ourselves on the day we visited. We enjoyed clear skies & enjoyed the view..,,,
,,"Interesting view, little else",4,,"It's the Flyer! Expperience an almost bird's eye view of the Siingapore skyline from an angle like no other.

Don't waste your time and money on the rest of the eating establishments. True blue Singaporeans would tell you that they are all a rip-off and not worth the money.

Fill up on good hearty food before you arrive, queue for the Flyer, snap your pictures and get out.",,,
,,Could do with some commentary,3,,"Good fun, but would be better with some commentary. Fab views and big pods , try dinner at singapore food trail after food is cheap and delicious.",,,
,,Great for thrill seekers,5,,Brilliant but a tad expensive. Food courts can be found here and you can pick up a little river trip from here. My hubby loved the flier.,,,
,,Brilliant View,5,,"Excellent experience and view of Singapore. Each cart is air conditioned and large for a family. The ride takes about a half hour to complete; the night view is probably even more spectacular, but the day allows you to see the area.",,,
,,Good but could be better,4,,"We visited in 2009 and since then a lot has changed in Singapore, so definitely worth another visit to the flyer to see it from the air. The only disappointment was the lack of commentary OR guides to what you are seeing!! In 2009, visitors were provided with a circular piece of paper, with photos and descriptions which corresponded to what you were seeing. Now it seems you have to guess! I don't understand why? Apart from this, it was enjoyable and arguably the best view of the city.",,,
,,Bird's Eye View of Singapore!,4,,"Situated near Marina bay,towering the Singapore Skyline,overlooking the Gardens by the Bay,having beautiful view of The Port,its one of the best experience of Singapore! Don't fear of height as its very slow moving Wheel with all glass cabin giving u the best view of Singapore skyline.",,,
,,160m above ground view of Singapore,5,,"Stunning views of Singapore - went during the day, worth a visit. Its an amazing design - nothing in the middle except wires. Not too many people in a capsule so easy to take photo's. Good views of the Gardens by the Bay. Suggest combine the trip with a visit to Gardens by the Bay.",,,
,,Worthwhile visit even if afraid of heights!,5,,Amazing views of Singapore during the day. At night it is lit up. My son and I are afraid of heights but looking out at the view rather than looking straight down made the experience worthwhile. Glad we did it. Expensive especially when a family ticket consists of 2 adults and 1 child. We were a family of 4.,,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,We took the Singapore Flyer at about dusk on our last night in Singapore. No queue and very reasonably priced! It was great fun and gives tourists a great overview of the city of Singapore. Thoroughly recommended for all!,,,
,,Great views but avoid if any risk of storms,5,,"Amazing views. When we were about to get on a storm started, there was not much information available from staff. It did eventually open 1.5 hours later as they run the wheel for an entire revolution before letting people on again. Would recommend, however avoid if any storms are forecast.",,,
,,Nice views,3,,"My parents were visiting and we took them to the Singapore Flyer as part of the site seeing tour we hosted them. It is a nice area, with local hawker food type shops etc. the wheel itself is quite spectacular however, I feel the price is a little too high, especially for family members, ie almost $120 for four of us for what is half an hour...",,,
,,Great views of Sigapore,5,,Worth the money and the view and the ride is great taxi from the centre of town is only around $6 and the best way to get there.,,,
,,A tick on my bucket list,5,,"This was a must do for me, but my husband was too apprehensive to join me. Scary or not, I just had to do it. So glad I did. Yes, not for the feint hearted, but do able, and the experience will never be forgotten. Photographs prove the amazing views. Do it. Such a good feeling of achievement too!",,,
,,A Must if visiting S'pore,4,,"Definitely not the tallest ,but gives you an amzing view of singapore. and a closer shot of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which is a structure of beauty.",,,
,,Great views. Two best eyes,4,,"This is one of the best eyes to visit. The view is Amazing of the marina and the city, the lights at night tells the tale of the city. Took about 30mins around but the family loved it. Heard there is a course available, will be back the next time with my wife to indulge.",,,
,,Must go up,5,,"Scenic and breathtaking view of Singapore. You can see the F1 grandstand and part of the track below. The solar 'tree' gardens. The marina and mall. Marina Bay Sands and the skyline.

The line moves quickly and each car holds many people. All seem to be polite in sharing views.",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,we did this as part of our Singapore airlines stopover package. Only 4 other people in the capsule so plenty of room to move around and see in every direction. It moves so slowly and smoothly it is quite deceptive - at times I thought we had stopped!,,,
,,expensive,3,,Views are good. But it is a boring activity and price relatively high. Would not recommend unless you really hv nothing better to do.,,,
,,not really worth it,3,,Gives you a great view of the city however I think it's very expensive for a very short ride. The staff manning the souvenir pictures were impatient and forgot to give my change.,,,
,,Nice view but you have to stand,3,,You can have the overall view of Singapore. We went there at the evening and stay in the flyer from sunset to night time. But you have to stand because you still will be asked to go in even there is no seats available.,,,
,,Do it!,5,,"After only ever seeing the flyer from above, this trip I finally managed to go on it.

There were four of us in my group and we were given a carriage to ourselves, as it wasn't busy. It was great! I'm not good with heights but this was fine as I felt very safe and secure.

The wheel moves very slowly and is very peaceful. I saw dining carriages so it would be an ideal place for a special celebration. The whole 'trip' takes about 30-40 minutes and the view is spectacular.

The cost was about $AU36 per adult. It's not wheelchair-friendly as the wheel doesn't stop - you need to hop on as it continues to turn.

I got some great photos and I'd definitely do it again.",,,
,,Best views of Singapore,5,,This is a must if you want to see the Singapore Skyline. We went up on a clear day and you could see across to Indonesia! Well worth the money!,,,
,,Dinner on the Flyer,4,,"Booked in for a dinner trip on the Flyer over Easter and had a great time. Nice four course meal over two full revolutions of the flyer with the obvious wonderful views of the Singapore skyline. Make sure your arrive around 30 mins before the departure time as you'll need to organise wine, etc. for you meal, as (for obvious reasons) you can not purchase drinks once ""on-board"". Extremely well organised but for some this meal will be a little rushed (i.e. four courses in an hour is pretty quick).",,,
,,What a view !,5,,"The service was first class as we went with a wheelchair . Once in the capsule the view was fantastic . We were very lucky as it was a clear day and could see Malaisya in the distance, the beautiful gardens , the city and more. Highly recommend !!",,,
,,Must visit,5,,"This flyer is a good choice if you are visiting Singapore for the first time. You'll be able to see many landmarks of Singapore. Marina Bay Sands looks very beautiful from above, also the dome of Garden By The Bay. Quite pricey but it worth. I recommend you to go visit on night since you can see beautiful night view from above.",,,
,,amazing views at night,5,,"Not really a fan of heights and after freaking out at one altitude bar a few days before i thought i was going to struggle on this. We got on at around 9pm, there was around 7 people in our cabin and i was a bit nervous on the way up but the views were amazing and the fear soon subsided. so glad we did it.",,,
,,Amazing view,5,,"Even if you are afraid of heights, you absolutely must do the Singapore Flyer. It gives you a 360 degrees view of the whole city. Best to do it at sunset.",,,
,,A nice view at night,4,,If you've ever been on one these sky wheels before you won't feel much different about this one. We took it at night and saw the beautiful Supertrees (from the Gardens by the Bay) lit up. You could also get a different view of the Sky Park of MBS hotel.,,,
,,Singapore 360 degree,5,,Whats the best way to see the city without getting a crick in the neck. I would say it is the Singapore flyer. It is a tourist's delight and leaves you feeling amazed at the modern architectural city. The Gardens by the Bay almost feels like being on the sets of the Avatar. The height makes for amazing aerial photgraphy and the best part is that you arrive all refreshed and not at all dizzy in this wonderfully controlled flyer. Good fun,,,
,,Lovely views,3,,"Amazing views of Singapore and lovely water feature underneath. I think if their was some audio, explaining what the buildings were it would have been better.",,,
,,Relaxation with a Beautiful View of Singapore,5,,"I have to admit that I got easily exhausted touring Singapore due to the humidity. As someone from the Philippines, it can be funny, but yes it's true. Anyway, this was where we mostly rested. It was relaxing and very clean, totally breathtaking.",,,
,,Wow - what views!!,5,,"No crowds, superb views and a well worth trip. We even met a couple in the pod who had been to Singapore before and showed us some of the best sights!! Definitely a must trip....",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,"The wheel takes about half an hour to do a full rotation. The movement is so smooth that you don't even know you are the highest point of the wheel. Be sure to have a camera with fully charged batteries, you will need it for all the photo opportunities.",,,
,,Great way to see the city!,5,,"The flyer gives a good view of the city. Given the continuing presence of smog, i recommend going during the evening so you can see the beautiful singapore skyline!",,,
,,Oh Yeah! You are in for a treat!,5,,"This was really another one of Singapore's fantastic tourist spots. Even if you are afraid of heights, the way this is designed will minimize all of that. I cannot imagine visiting Singapore and not doing the Flyer. The cost was $66sgd for 2 people. The photographic opportunities while you are going around are really great! You get an unbelievable view of the city. The cars are very comfortable and air conditioned. It takes 30 minutes to go around. We went in the a.m. before there were any lines so we immediately were able to get on.",,,
,,Great view,4,,It has a great view at the end of the boulevard. Quiet and relaxing place and not too far from my hotel,,,
,,Truly amazing views,5,,We where all amazed at the views from the Singapore flyer. It took about 30 minutes to do the full circle on the flyer well worth going on,,,
,,SINGAPUR FLYER by night,5,,"Brillant ,"" must see "" , by night , about a 30 minutes extreme nice panorama view , frontline , ""vyou think you are in manhatten """,,,
,,Breathtaking !!,5,,"I had visited the Singapore flyer in March 2015, I had booked to sightseeing bus and took a stop here.The ticket was a combo ticket combo with the sightseeing...costed me SD 59$
The flyer takes a complete rotation in 30 minutes.It is 165 m high and the view from the capsule is beautiful....The sea and surrounding area looks beautiful :)",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,Reasonable price but why can't none Singaporeans over 60 get the reduced rate'? Only 5 of us in our capsule. Very easy to move round and see everything.,,,
,,Impressive,5,,"Certainly it is one of most famous sights in Singapore. It is bigger than its ""colleague"" in London, or in Vienna. Definitely it offers an impressive view of the city and the sea. It is worth to visit, but of course only when the sky is blue and clear.",,,
,,Knocks Socks off London Eye,5,,"Great place to view Singapore and the surrounding area. Well organised and plenty of covered areas for queueing, especially when sunny, something London could duplicate but for the rain and wind. Cars are not crowded and fhe 30min flight is well worth the S$33 (拢16) price tag.",,,
,,Beautifull view,4,,"Very nice view all around, especially when you reach the top. During the night everything is colorfull, look very beautifull.",,,
,,Decent watch,4,,The view from the top is good. but I didnt find it something spectcular. This is one of the places in Singapore whihc can be easily given a miss.,,,
,,Couldn't be more helpful.Disabled Friendly,5,,"The staff of this attraction couldn't have been kinder and made me feel so comfortable. The lovely gentleman who escorted us up to the Wheel and saw us safely on and off and took us right to the front of the taxi queue after the ride. This was also the only place in Singapore that offered a concessionary fare for disabled & carer. We went at night and the view was stunning, we saw the F1 circuit, and resolved to come back to Singapore to watch the GP live. We got some beautiful photos of night time Singapore and would highly recommend this ride.",,,
,,Definitely worth the views!,5,,Stunning views of the Singapore skyline at night! This was one of our favorite things we did on our trip. Was interesting to see the harbors and ships as well as beyond the downtown area. Would definitely recommend! Reasonably priced for a 30 minute ride.,,,
,,A must to do in Singapore on a fine day,5,,Fabulous views from the Singapore flyer..well worth the purchase however best to secure with the hop on hop off day tour as you save some money. Stunning views over Singapore. Not good on heights however felt very safe and secure.Good access if you have a disability.We walked from the Adonis Hotel (see review) booked our ticket at Suntec city where the Hop on Hop off bus departs. Suntec centre is nearing completion from a major upgrade..Starbucks located first level near escalator for a cuppa before venturing out. Easier to catch hop on hop off to get to Singapore Flyer than trying to navigate your way by walking from Suntec city shopping complex..,,,
,,Great way to see Singapore,4,,Fantastic way to get a great sense of Singapore and its buildings and the layout of this wonderful city,,,
,,Just another spin,3,,"The Flyer is exciting the first time you're in it. If you have been to Singapore about 6 times, the allure of seeing the City State from way up high no longer holds the thrill. It's like having taken the City Bus tour. Your next visit gets concentrated on places you have seen from afar. This time you are inspecting the trees rather than seeing the forest again.",,,
,,"fab,a must do",5,,"we visited Singapore in oct 14 and went on the Singapore flyer,well worth going on as you can see all of the attractions around the bay,it takes approx. 45mins to go all the way around as goes very slow and due to this fact I loved it,as I had been worried about the height of it,you can hardly feel it moving,its a wonderful experience",,,
,,Mo毛t & Chandon Champagne Flight,5,,"The Singapore Flyer offers a unique experiences and outstanding views on Singapore. The giant wheel moves very slowly, so you have lots of opportunities to take great pictures. It takes about half an hour to complete the tour.

We booked the Mo毛t & Chandon Champagne Flight in advance. No hassle with waiting lines, very comfortable. Staff was super friendly and accompanied us to the entrance. We had the cabin all for ourselves! It was great. The champagne was excellent and there were strawberries and chocolat to have a bite with the champagne.",,,
,,Singapore Sling flight,4,,We booked the Singapore Sling option. A bit on the expensive side but it was a wonderful experience for couples.,,,
,,London Eye like,5,,"Similar to the London Eye. It is spacious, and more importantly air conditioned. There are seats to sit and watch the sights go by and my wife and I had a cabin to ourselves.

She caught me for the first time in years here with an April Fool by asking me if I had the tickets when they were in her bag all the time, then watched me spluttering in disbelief at the prospect of going back to the hotel in the stiffling heat.

Well worth the trip.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"Awesome view, but the flyer is quite slow so you can easily click photos. View from the top is beautiful. The ticket price is quite expensive. Cabins are big. Can visit once in your trip.",,,
,,Birds eye view of a great city,4,,"As part of the Hop-on/off bus tour we visited the Singapore Flyer in Marina Bay. I think we picked a good time (c10am on a weekday) as there were no queues at all and we were able to go straight on. You enter a large enclosed cabin (capable of taking c30 people I would guess) which rotates as part of a wheel-like structure (very like the London Eye). The views of the Marina, the coast line and the City are amazing and of course for Grand Prix fans the Flyer gives you an excellent view of the Singapore circuit including the Start/Finish line and the pits.",,,
,,Perfect view on Singapore,5,,"We had a beautiful, clear day to see the sights from Singapore flyer. I found the speed perfect to assure I had enough time ti enjoy the beautiful scene also take pictures as well. It is really worth to come here, I liked it more than the view from Marina bay sands.",,,
,,Great view of Singapore!!,4,,"A must do in Singapore.It offers a great view of the Harbor,Marina Bay Sands,Skyline,Gardens by the Bay.The windows on the pods make night photography a bit difficult.",,,
,,It is worth it,5,,It is worth to get on the Flyer. You will get a nice view of the city and enjoy being on top of the world!!,,,
,,The best way to have a view of Singapore,4,,Quite an easy event solo or for families. A nice view of course - somewhat expensive (33 Sin$ for one).,,,
,,"""Awesome view and spot most the tourist spots in Singapore""",5,,It is must visit tourist spot in Singapore. The views are really good. I prefer others to have a ride in both morning and night. You can see most of the other tourist spots from here.,,,
,,Perfect view of the city,5,,"We visited in Grand Prix week, because of this it was a bit awkward to get to road closures the race track etc. Be determined and go it is well worth it",,,
,,What a vue,5,,"you can see all of marina bay from here, not bad value for money and will last about an hour ish a must do if you stay in singapore",,,
,,Breathtaking view,4,,While up on the Singapore flyer one gets a chance to see Singapore in a different light. It has a spectacular view of the Gardens by the Bay on one side and the sea on the other.. Worth the 40 minute trip.,,,
,,Nice Experience,5,,A Novelty not to be missed. Wonderful view of the city. It takes about an hour for the Flyer to complete one revolution.,,,
,,Brilliant views of the Marina Bay gardens and Singapore city,4,,The Singapore Flyer (big wheel) is very reasonably priced for the excellent views that you will get of the Marina Bay gardens and city. We went up during the day and it was very clear so we saw some really beautiful sights. It is well worth the trip. The whole trip in the flyer i about 40-50 minutes which is enough.,,,
,,Wonderful night view,5,,Had a wonderful night view of the city. Visited at 9.30pm. No crowd. In half hour you get the best views of the city. Also were able to see the laser show at the Gardens & Marina bay from the top. Gave a totally different perspective. Not to be missed. Worth the money spent.,,,
,,What a view!,5,,"Just been on the flyer this morning, it was superb! Spectacular views of the marina and city. Right next to a bit of F1 track, where you can have a Stroll afterwards and your photo taken at the pits.",,,
,,Still a great view 2nd time around!,4,,Great views and well organised. We didn't need to queue too long even though it was on the weekend. Great place for a group of friends or family.,,,
,,Nice view but expensive,5,,"Finally, i tried this ride, nice, good views for photos i like it here, but the price is so expensive, well this is singapore where everything is soo damn expensive",,,
,,singapore view on top of it,3,,We could see singapore view from the flyer and absolutely could take pict with the back ground of it. I was took it aroud 5pm and it would be better when it dark come since the light would look awesome but there would be add charge after 6pm. It was good for first visitor to see arround. Well done experience..,,,
,,"Great views, but you really need a clear day",4,,"This is a great attraction offering potentially wonderful views at a reasonable price. You do however ideally need a clear day. We had good views over the city but the haze restricted this somewhat, but did not spoil the experience.",,,
,,The tallest ferris wheel in the world,4,,"Having been on the London Eye a couple of times I thought I would try out the Singapore Flyer. I caught a train to a nearby station and then walked. Easy to find. But once there it was hard to find where to purchase a ticket and then where to enter to get to the actual ride. Eventually found my way. Really poor signage and no staff to assist with directions.
The actual ride was very good. It wasn't busy and there were only 5 people in the pod I was on. The view was fantastic and it is worth doing.",,,
,,Average,3,,We did the flyer during the day so that may be the difference. The view was great but the ride just a tad bit long....maybe at night it would be better with the lights of the city,,,
,,Good views- what you would expect,3,,Just like any other flyer around the word eg: London Eye etc but worth it to tick of the list of attractions in Singapore. Very good views and was amazed at how high this flyer is. Good thing to do but wouldnt be disappointed if it was left off the list.,,,
,,top of the city,5,,"Singapore flyer at Marina bay is prominent land mark .Anyone visiting Singapore should take part in this spin tour. Each car is in the size of a mini bus and gives a good view of city.
Flyer is moving very slowly upwards and reaches to the top most point from there the view is magnificent .
never miss to take a spin in this wonderful flyer",,,
,,Expensive And Not Worth The Time,1,,"Singapore has one of the most fantastic skylines in the world and the idea of seeing it from (the now) second largest Ferris wheel in the world is tantalizing. However, this is an over rated tourist trap. If you are traveling on a budget and/or have a short stay in Singapore you can pass up this experience without doubt.

The Flyer is indeed beautiful- but from the ground as part of Singapore's skyline. From the inside it is just not as exciting.

And for those Ferris wheel lovers and families with kids: This is not a 'ride'-the experience isn't thrilling as a Ferris wheel should be and it becomes boring very quickly.",,,
,,amazing view,4,,"the view is nice, specially for the photographers can click the singapore skyline. Best the food served below is one of the best barbecues i've tasted",,,
,,Powerful Views of this Powerhouse Nation,5,,"With only 30 hours in Singapore, this packed a lot of punch in under an hour. One gets a Birdseye view of this financial powerhouse nation and the towering landscape evidencing the wealth and manifestation of Lee Kuan Yew's vision for this island nation. The wheel is one of the tallest in the world, rotates fully in about a half hour and is strategically placed to take advantage of views of the financial district, the quays, marina bay, gardens by the bay, F1 riverside, national stadium, marine port, surrounding waterways and container ships out in the bay (it's one of the top 5 busiest ports in the world). Highly recommend to get a feel for the magnitude of development, land reclamation projects and just plain thrill of the height. I would not suggest nighttime other than dusk to ensure you see the views otherwise it's just a light show.",,,
,,What a way to start our 5 day holiday in Singapore!,5,,We got on at around 8:30pm and the ride took about half an hour. What a start to our 5 day visit to Singapore. It was an amazing view of the city from the top. We even had a glimpse of the other places we had scheduled to see. Money well spent.,,,
,,Up and a view,4,,During a recent business trip to Singapore I had the opportunity to take the Flyer and found the experience provided a number of interesting highlights of the surrounding area. Well worth the time taken.,,,
,,Only for ferris wheel fans,3,,"For some people, ferris wheel may bring back sentimental memories and they would really love this place.

However I have mixed feeling about this place.

It's located in strategic location, with few of the Marina bay and Garden of the bay, there is also food stall in the areas around with other shops.

However the flyer it self did not offer any spectacular view, the glass is quite thick and in my opinion a bit dirty, you wont have nice and clear view of the areas.

Is this a must go place? no in my opinion, however we got free entry to this attraction as part of our holiday package, so no harms done",,,
,,"Yes it's an Imitation, But Its Singapore",5,,"Once London built the London Eye. every large City seems to be building a similar Ferris Wheel-type feature. The ride is not the point, the point is the view. The Singapore Flyer presents the City from a spectacular vantage. The basic ride is satisfying, and just the right length at 30 minutes. The pricey options for a tea service or a meal are not worth the cost. Ride the Flyer and spend that money elsewhere.",,,
,,Best views in town,5,,"I have been lucky enough to have been on the Singapore Flyer twice now and each time has been an incredible experience. Don't hesitate in even trying this attraction, the rotation of the wheel takes 32 minutes so it is very gentle and smooth and the views are just gob smacking. After obtaining our ticket we just walked on there was minimal wait time. Each cabin accommodates 29 people and there is plenty of room. Highly recommended",,,
,,Wonderful views,4,,"Booking was slow but uncomplicated. We waited after buying tickets while a party of schoolchildren went through - pleasant seating on the ground floor, very nice iced chocolate from the booth, and an interesting exhibition as you arrive at the entrance. We were lucky, it was quiet so we had a cabin for the two of us only. Cabins are spacious, plenty of seating, and fully air conditioned, and move very smoothly. The whole event took about 40 minutes, with absolutely breathtaking views across the harbour and over the city, not to mention the harbourside directly beneath you.",,,
,,OMG!!,5,,"What a view it was... You can view entire Singapore in this giant wheel.It is simply superb and gives a great view.. Everyone shall enjoy a lot,though being expensive but enjoyment has not barriers..",,,
,,Amazing view when at the summit,5,,"This is a very slow moving giant flyer but do take a ride in this. The view, especially when you reach the top is breathtaking. View of Marina Bay adds glamour to this ride.",,,
,,awesome view from up there,5,,"awesome view, a must visit for everyone. the only problem was that the food joints there accept cash only not card rest everything was awesome bank of the river it gives an astonishing view of the city.",,,
,,Overrated,3,,Instead of spending your money here I suggest you visit Marina Bay Sands as the view is as good from there but less expensive. If you don't mind paying it's a good thing to do if you need to kill a few hours in the afternoon.,,,
,,Very good,5,,The Flyer was on our priority list before going to Singapore. But this was our last venture at Singapore. It was one of the best experiences of our life. A whole capsule was given for our family which made this journey which made it all the more special.,,,
,,Perfet photo oppertunity,5,,"Very safe, great value. I think the Singapore flyer is a MUST DO while in Singapore , You'll regret if you don't !",,,
,,Go at night!,5,,on a clear night nothing beats the views from the Flyer. Great photo opportunity. If you are scared of heights stay on the bench n the middle and you can still see well but don't feel queasy.,,,
,,Like flying in an airplane!,5,,I took a flyer cabin with 4 elderly indian ladies and was surprised of the size of the cabin. Astonishing views! Rotation was quite slow and I had plenty of time to rush from one corner to another taking snap shots on the roof of Singapore! For those who are afraid of heights: do not worry - being in the cabin is like being in an airplane;),,,
,,Best pictures of Singapore.,4,,From up there you can get the best pictures from Singapore downtown and bay. The flyer it's an amazing engineering creation. Maybe a little expensive (33 singapore USD per person) but if you're there you cannot missed the ride.,,,
,,expensive,3,,"the ticket for it is too expensive. and you may feel boring after spend so much of time only there, but the views is very beautiful.",,,
,,Spectacular,5,,"I did the night ride and it was more than I expected. The views over Singapore were magnificent, the pace of the ride was great giving you plenty of time to scan the horizon....it is a must do in Singapore",,,
,,Wait for a clear day,4,,"To get a really amazing view, make sure you choose a clear day. It is bigger than the London a Eye. Underneath The Flyer at ground level, they have a beautiful rain forest garden which is well worth looking around. Find a seat and sit and enjoy the surrounding gardens and waterfalls.",,,
,,Pricey but worth it,3,,"My first time in Singapore so I shocked about prices but after all I deal with it , It's not London's eye but interesting enough to feel's the city below your feet's, entering gate was not fancy either as much as the cabins , overall I enjoyed the time.",,,
,,A must do,5,,One of the must see things to do. Gives you a panaromic view of Singapore. Best time to do it is in the day so that you can get to see the surroundings at various angles as the wheel spins over at a leisure pace. Tickets are priced at around 33 SGD per person. Baggages are scanned and the entire experience is like boarding a flight.,,,
,,Good views,5,,Had to go twice once in day time and once at night as Singapore is totally different at night with all the lazer shows etc well worth a visit,,,
,,Round and round,4,,"Superb views of the CBD, harbor, etc. from dizzying heights. This is one of (if not THE) biggest Ferris wheels, and it gives a tranquil, complete perspective and airborne view of the area.

The only downside is the (fairly) high price of admission, and the omnipresent photo booths that the herd you into prior to boarding.

That said, the views and the experience are quite worthwhile.

The ride takes about 30 minutes to do a complete rotation, and the cars are enormous, so you have plenty of space to walk around and get different viewpoints of the skyline. I visited around 2pm so the lines were short.",,,
,,They could improve on the experience,3,,"Having been on the London Eye and the Melbourne Star, I felt the Singapore Flyer needed some improvement. There was no map inside or handout to show what we were looking at. There could have also been an audio comentary, which would have made it much more than a ferris wheel ride.",,,
,,Must visit attraction during Singapore visit :-),5,,"This is another Must-Do activity if you are visiting Singapore as a tourist. I have been on the London Eye and I must say that taking a ride on Singapore Flyer is a better experience. The capsules can accomodate about 15-20 people and there are seating arrangements if you do not want to stand for the entire duration. The ride itself lasts for half hour. The view from the top is captivating and on one side you can get a full view of the city and on the other side the bird's eye view of the Marina Sands Skypark building with the adjacent Flower & Cloud Dome looks breathtaking. Suggest, take the ride in the morning hours for a clear view of the city from the top. It was truly a never to miss and wonderful experience for all of us.",,,
,,perfect view,5,,"I took the mrt to get to the sg flyer. The guy at ticketing was helpful and accommodating. This is one of the highlights of my trip. I got the capsule just for myself as I got there on an early afternoon. Perfect way to view the city. used to be the world's tallest ferris wheel not until last year when it was replaced by las vegas.
You only pay 33 sgd for this and for sure you will also find it worth your bucks! try it for yourselves!",,,
,,Great place!,5,,"We visited it in the evening. The view was stunning! When we were going up, I was afraid, but when we going down everything was ok. It was very cold inside. It is one of the best attractions in Singapore",,,
,,Breathtaking views of the city and harbour,5,,"This is the first time we have been on the singapore flyer and it will not be our last. On a clear day it's a great way to see the harbour and all the ships lining up to enter the busy port and to see the enormity of the vast sprawling city, it travels very slowly so you don't feel uneasy at all.

Great trip not to be missed",,,
,,Amazing experience fantastic for disabled,5,,"Just loved it , my husband is on a walking frame and the staff were fantastic ,a young girl came with us up the lift and got my husband on when we got back 1/2 hour later she was waiting for us ,they stop the wheel for disabled to get on ,20 out of 10",,,
,,great views,5,,this is similar to the london eye a leisurely pace going round it gives you fantastic view of singapore. and ample oppotunities for you to take photos,,,
,,Great views of the city!,4,,"We were surprised that there was no queue for the Flyer and we actually bought our tickets before we travelled to Singapore. We were told by a local that the flyer is not as busy as they would like and it may be sold which would be a terrible shame as its such a good way to view the city, harbour and get your bearings!
We got some great photo's from all angles, including the Grand Prix track which is right next door!",,,
,,*Wonderful Night view*,4,,"Went up the flyer at night with my nephew and niece. The night view is wonderful if u like to see MBS, flyovers, office buildings etc. Price per adult is about S$31. The whole experience took less than an hour. Nearest mrt tp alight is Promenade station. 4",,,
,,Moment you will never forget,4,,"We have been on the Singapore Flyer twice.
It is truly a wonderful experience, you can see all of Singapore from the top of the rotation. The cabin can hold up to 15-20 people at once.

I recommend going during the day, as you can see all the landmark. At nighttime it is hard to take photo of the surrounding. But nighttime visit tends have less passenger, we only had 6 passenger on our night visit.

Flyer also offer couple 4 course dining experience, which we haven't tried, but seems gimmicky as you are offered short course dinner and 2 rotation. I can't imagine myself being stuck in the same enclosed space for long period of time.

Tip: Go to bathroom beforehand (rotation is slow...), get your camera battery charged.",,,
,,Expensive but great views,5,,Process of getting tickets to getting on was very quick and they had interactive displays along the way in different rooms for children and adults alike. At 165m it is one of the largest in the world. Great way to see the city of Singapore and surroundings on a clear day. Very smooth and the whole circuit takes approx 30mins. I would imagine that the night time views with all the lights of the city would be spectacular. A little bit expensive @ $33 per person but still worthwhile to see the 'big picture' of Singapore,,,
,,What a view,5,,"We arrived on a sunny, clear morning, which is a big help! Mornings are normally clearer in Singapore. Short cue after taxi dropped us within 20m of the ticket office. Entrance to the flyer is up several floors but once on board the spacious pod, it's a relaxing way to spend 30minutes. The flyer revolves slowly so no motion sickness or anything. The views of the city and surrounds are tremendous, especially Marina Bay hotel. Staff are friendly and helpful. Wheel chair access is good via lift.",,,
,,Best way to see Singapore,5,,"While in Singapore for F1 we had to go on the Flyer, it was an excellent way to see the skyline of Singapore and bustling streets and attractions, it was value for money and you can opt for different rides such as cocktails etc while on ride. It's about 30 mins in total.

One tip don't attempt when the F1 is on unless you get some help.",,,
,,Round and round,3,,"as my first venture onto the big wheels this was ok. We had a pod to ourselves and got to see the bay, the Grand Prix strip and stands and a great sky line . Not sure what others are expecting to be honest :)",,,
,,Singapore flyer sling,5,,"What a good time we had in the Flyer. At the time it was the world's tallest, but now Las Vegas holds that record. The view for 30 minutes or so is great. We chose the option to drink a Singapore Sling while we went around, and ended up,with our own private capsule. I guess we were the only ones at that moment who wanted a pricey drink while we toured Singapore from up high. We bought tickets ahead online. We felt that although it was pricey, it was worth it. Something we had to cross off our bucket list and had fun doing it.",,,
,,Expensive but worth it !,5,,"At first glance, the Singapore Flyer reminded me of the London Eye. According to my guide it has 28 cabins and takes 28 minutes to complete a rotation and is the world's tallest observation wheel. It could be a bit scary but its movement is barely noticeable. You could have a bird's (rather an eagle's) eye view of Singapore skyline, the harbour and the marina, various parks and the road network down below. At its highest point you get up to the level or slightly higher than the the towering marina bay sands hotel's skypark. Do not forget to look for the faint shadows of Indonesian islands to the south and buildings in the Malaysian mainland to the north. Managed to see both as the sky was shiny and very clear during my trip. It is an experience you would not forget. Do not buy souvenirs at this premises as they are over priced - you could buy the same at much cheaper rates in most other places.",,,
,,Up In The Sky,5,,Just a great way to spend some time before dinner especially if you are dining near Marina Bay restaurants. Takes about 30 minutes. We went while it was still light and we were able to take some great photos. Enclosd capsules makes you feel very safe. We did the basic ride and it was worth it.,,,
,,Slow but steady. Get a view,4,,"The flyer may be a little boring and expensive for some. But for us we had never had any such experience, so it was amazing. Especially when my two year old was enjoying. for half an hour you are on top of the city. The view below is amazing. You can see the city skyline as well as singapore river and the dam which separates it from ocean.",,,
,,GREAT VIEWS OF SINGAPORE,5,,"This was our second visit on the Flyer and once again really enjoyed the experience. A tip before boarding obtain one of the maps explaining the areas, we did not do this this time thinking there would be some brochures on board. It would make your experience more enjoyable placing the sights on the map as you go around. Great lunch at the Hawkers food market at ground level. Be aware that there can be difficulties in obtaining Taxis, we needed to take a taxi at the end as unable to walk to the MRT and it took a while and some local knowledge who advised us to call and book a taxi from one of the companies listed at the stand, especially as it was shift change over time !!!",,,
,,Nice time with family,4,,"Its bit on an expensive side. I suggest if you are travelling with kids, please go there, they will love the sight and view of skyline. Its pretty slow and give a good view of Singapore.",,,
,,High in the sky,5,,We went during the afternoon and was thrilled to see the city from the various heights. We had a tourist map so that helped to identify some landmarks since it was the first thing we did in the city. The only comment that would have improved the experience would be placing a map inside each pod so buildings/areas can be more easily identified (especially at night),,,
,,Worth a visit.,3,,It takes about 30 mins to complete a cycle. You can even reserve ahead to have your dinner in the cell with your love ones. Visiting it at night is better than in the day time because the night scene of Singapore fantastic. Try it!,,,
,,Awsome,5,,"We bought tickets via online, this way is a little bit cheaper than directly buy at the ticket office.
We were during the Chinese New Year period, we tought that there will be a lot of people but luckily not.
The ride takes 30 minutes and it has a panoramic view to the city and Marina Bay.",,,
,,In the sky with the flier,4,,"Fantastic views, the gondola was clean, tidy and the view as we went around was breath taking. There was no queue and we were in a gondola with our friends. We had it all to ourselves which meant there were no phot difficulties.",,,
,,A waste of time,2,,"There's not much view to see since Singapore's landscape is full of buildings and on the other side, just the ocean. If you have only 4 days in SG, you can take this one out of your itinerary and consider other good attractions such as the Zoo and Gardens by the bay. I would only suggest this one for those who will consider having dinner inside the attraction as the city's illumined buildings will be your background and if during sunset, but everything else, not worth the price.",,,
,,Get High,5,,The Worlds largest observation wheel 165m tall. Amazing views of Singapore. The slow rotation is almost unnoticeable Don't forget to use the washroom prior to boarding.,,,
,,Good view,4,,"There aren't much things in Singapore for travelers. But this is surely one. Its a nice view as it goes to the top. People afraid of heights may be scared at first, but its very safe. The wheel rotates pretty slow, around 20 mins for 1 circle. They also have dining options on the wheel at different prices than normal package. It's costly as everything is expensive in Singapore, but definitely worth a visit. Also they have a food court downstairs at level G, where you can get all kinds of Asia food from Thai, Vietnamese, Indian, Chinese and Malay.",,,
,,Must do in Singapore!,5,,"Did the Singapore Flyer today, 18/03, and it was really worth the rather steep price of the ticket, which at 33SGD isn't given! We did it during the day but didn't regret not going for the probably more romantic night time experience. The view is amazing and you discover how much is going on in Singapore and how much has been built in the last few years.",,,
,,A Good Place to Relax and watch the City,4,,The view of the city from Singapore flyer is not that great as compared to London eye. But certainly it's a good place to relax and watch the skyline of the city. The only problem was in accessing it via metro rail as it is situated a bit far from the nearest MRT station.,,,
,,Stunning panoramic view of Marina Bay,4,,"One of the must visit attractions once in Singapore. Best time to visit is at Dusk time with sunset views of illuminated Marina Bay. Provides stunning panoramic views of Marina Bay, Garden by Bay, Singapore Grad Pix circuit & The Marlion, in A/C capsules. The speed of Flyer is very gentle so no concern for those with motion sickness, vertigo & elderly. We bought the tickets from our hotel concierge desk at discounted price & that added to the Fun. Packages for different duration & with Snack/Meals are also available.",,,
,,Great views of the city,4,,"I visited this attraction while in town with friends who are living in Singapore and we came to the Flyer because it is one of their favorite things to do.... And they are locals!

Sure it's got a touristy feel to it, but the views of the city that you get from 180 meters just can't be beat. The carriages are closed in and air conditioned so it's a very comfortable ride and the wheel turns so slowly you really don't even feel like you are moving.

This is a green attraction for anyone who is visiting for the first time so they can get their bearings of the Marina Bay Area and it will also be a big hit for any travelers with children.",,,
,,Finally tried the Singapore flyer,4,,"Brought some friends from overseas to the flyer. You will get a good view of the bay area (marina bay sands, esplanade, gardens by the bay, F1 pit and the banks / hotels). Took about 30 mins to complete the ride. For $20, it was worth the view. I recommend taking this at night to see the lights.",,,
,,Great aerial views,5,,"We rode the Flyer earlier in the day (about 10:30) and avoided the crowds. We had a very good experience, with a car virtually to ourselves. The cars are spacious, with good vision, clean, with good aircon. Takes 30 minutes for the ride.
It is well organised and clean, and easy access from the MRT.
Recommended.",,,
,,Nice,4,,"It's a nice stop but not a must. Cabins are comfortable and view spectacular however it's not very cheap. If you are planning to have a drink in a hotel next to it, better safe your money as you can have a same view and nice luxury experience by going to the rooftop of Marina Bay Sands hotel.",,,
,,Good views in the evening about 33SGD charge,4,,"Easy to get in and you get great views from the city; if you have done the London Eye; this is similar to it
I went up in the evening and got great views of the skyline
try to go up late - 10pm is the last trip - less people late at night",,,
,,Nice view of SG,4,,"This was our first activity in our trip. It was nice to begin with..We took the city tours combo.. we got reasonable deal with food trail vouchers and all. The view was good with SG skyscrapers, Marina bay sands, sea etc..",,,
,,Went with friends for outing,4,,"I went once with my friends on the singapore flyer quite sometime ago. It's a good experience to be able to be high above the ground to get a nirce good cityview from Singapore!
Other than that, there isn't actually other entertainment nor play facilities around the Flyer. Recommend to go once or twice to see Singapore at a Birdseye view otherwise paying $28 for the 10min ride once is still fair enough!",,,
,,Singapore flyer,4,,"There is plenty of carpark spaces , it is very easy to self drive to Singapore flyer. There is retail shops , restaurants on the ground floor. When you take the flyer to the maximum level , the scenery is excellent. I heard flyer has dinner package also.",,,
,,Flying high on the flyer,4,,"We went on the flyer in the night since day time was too hot. The night view from here was amazing. at 40 storeys high, you get a beautiful view of Singapore. Once inside, this 30 minute ride is so slow, that you wont feel it moving at all.

Pricing: Do remember that if you fly on Air Singapore, then there are discounts on this attraction. there are several tour operators that offer this attraction at a discounted rate, do check online.

Eating: There are a number of restaurants in the vicinity here. But do remember, like in most parts of the city, here too the restaurants close early, so plan accordingly.",,,
,,Mrs Mac,5,,"I was a bit dubious at first, would I enjoy this experience? Yes I did, the ride was so smooth I didn't actually feel that I was as high up as I was. Fantastic views of the surrounding attractions, we will have to do it again in the daylight",,,
,,The Dumbest Attraction,1,,"Seriously, if you've ever been in an airplane or on a tower, you've seen better views. It was clean, comfortable, and so, so boring...just a slowly moving view of the city. If this is a must-do, man, Singapore needs some more attractions.",,,
,,Another Slow Moving Giant Wheel with a Beautiful Singapore Scenic,3,,"Another Slow Moving Giant Wheel with a Beautiful Singapore Scenic, its only drawback its slow speed as normal visitor too gets borerd sitting in the capsule for 30 minutes approx.

We guess it shall move faster a bit, rest its all fine. We liked the experience, but have seen such before alot many times at different places in the world.

So Singapore, should add some fun to it.",,,
,,A Great View,5,,Great viewing from lovely spacious cabins. Great value too especially with discount from your Singapore airlines boarding pass!,,,
,,A relaxing ride affording fabulous views of Singapore and beyond.,4,,"This is my third time in Singapore and so I thought it was time to bite the bullet and have a ride on the 'Singapore Flyer'. The Flyer opened in 2008 and up until last year it wore the crown the World's largest Ferris wheel. The Flyer has an overall height of 165 metres (541 ft) but on 31/March/14 the High Roller which stands at 167.6 m (550 ft) High Roller opened on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada, USA, taking the crown from The Flyer. Although having been to Las Vegas many times I am certain that the views from The Flyer are far more interesting than those of the Las Vegas Strip!

The Flyer is not cheap at SG$33.00 for an adult (circa GB拢16) for a 30 minute ride but I do think it was worth it. The 150m diameter wheel continually rotates very slowly (less than 1km/h) and you board and exit whilst the wheel is turning and as The Flyer's 28 air-conditioned capsules are mounted outboard of the rim of the wheel structure the views are always unobstructed... An amazing piece of engineering.

On entrance to the wheel there are exhibits giving interesting facts about the wheel and there are shops, a cinema and places to eat and drink in the building that surrounds the big wheel. I was in two minds about going on The Flyer but was glad I did as it was worth it and I recommend it to others... One of those things well worth doing even if just once.",,,
,,Must Do - Just enjoy the ride and view!,5,,"Amazing view of the all the key spots, MBS, City Skyline, the river. A must do on anyone's list in Singapore!",,,
,,Panoramic view over the whole Singapore,4,,It is a must do when in Singapore. You get to see an impressive panoramic view over the whole Singapore till Indonezia. The wheel itself is a tech wonder since every capsule spins itself and has air conditioning. Try it.,,,
,,Great View,4,,"spectacular views especially at night. Beware, the Flyer looks much closer than it really is, as it is so high. We saw it from our hotel balcony and set off to walk there. Big mistake! But thankfully we were able to get on without any queueing when we got there and had a great experience.

The Flyer is the starting point for many of the open top hop on hop off tours of the city and there is an atmospheric food court beneath it.",,,
,,Worth the effort to get to the flyer,4,,"This is an interesting attraction as it gives a scenic view over Singapore Island.

It is a little way away from the centre - worth taking a cab.

The ""carriages"" are large and have a seat in the middle from which everything can be seen.

There is no feeling of movement at all until the vista changes during the rotation of the wheel.

The entrance was worth looking over as it explained the size of the wheel and how it tracks - quite interesting really.

It is easy to get a cab back into the city about $10 but worth it the roads etc are a little hairy.",,,
,,Nice Place,4,,Nice you can see whole singapore from there and best part is the formula 1 race track which is just besides flyer and when you are in flyer you get best view of formula 1 pit stop and race track from top which is nicely viewable from top and can see full race track from there,,,
,,To be tried once,4,,"It was a visit that I believe was long overdue but it was worth it.
You have to try the Singapore Flyer once - and I think it'll be enough. Obviously there are multiple variations of all perspectives depending on the time of day but I believe you get what the wheel is about in only one visit.
Wherever you look from the cabin, you will enjoy a spectacular view, whether it is the skyline, the gardens or the bay.
If you are in transit in Singapore it's one of the attractions you are unlikely to be disappointed with - even though I reckon it is not a cheap option for what it is.",,,
,,"Good view, but not really worth it",3,,"We went to the Singapore flyer for my partners birthday. We thought it was a nice ride, good view, but we were not that impressed. The worst aspect was trying to get a taxi after we finished. Be careful regarding waiting in line if a navy ship comes into port as you will be waiting over an hour for a taxi. I highly recommend if you get into this situation, call the number on one of the cabs and book one, it will cost you a little extra, but at least you will get to where you want to go quickly and without waiting a million years for a cab.
Wouldn't recommend taking small children on this as there is not that much room for them to move about and if you have a niece like I do, she doesn't like to sit still for a long time.",,,
,,Go for the view,3,,"i did enjoy the flyer, but if you can go around sunset as i think seeing the city by night would of been amazing and the flyer is open till 10pm!!",,,
,,A Must See,4,,The view was spectacular! We went during the early evening. We upgraded to the champagne flight. The champagne was good - the one strawberry and one chocolate was okay. The staff was very helpful for loading and unloading with a wheelchair.,,,
,,More spectacular views!!,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a huge Ferris wheel. It takes about 35 minutes to make a full rotations, but it is worth the ride.",,,
,,A room with a view,4,,Great views of Singapore. We was able to get our bearings as were our hotel was. There wasn't any queueing and had a whole car to our selfs.,,,
,,A bird's eye view of Singapore,4,,Nice experience where you can go to heights without getting Acrophobia (very good for small children or people like me who hate roller coasters and giant wheels!) You get to see a real bird's eye view of Singapore!,,,
,,Quite liked it,4,,"I didn't think I'd like something so touristy, but the views were terrific, and the speed (therefore the length of the ride (about 20 minutes)) seemed about right.",,,
,,A Wheely great view.. and fun,4,,"It is one of the most expensive ferris-wheel rides in the world, but if you are in Singapore, it is a must do.
The ride is about $1 a minute, and takes 28 minutes. The slow nature gives you plenty of time to take careful pictures of the views you will remember for a lifetime.",,,
,,Great but nothing different,5,,"A tourist must, because it is there, but having been on a similar attraction in London, this is nothing strikingly different. A ggod view of the city and gardens as well as a tourist destination for other activities",,,
,,Good 360 degrees view of Singapore,5,,Visited daytime and had a good view of Singapore in a spacy cabin. Would like to visit again at night time. Worth a visit or two.,,,
,,Great but Overpriced,3,,"A great way to see Singapore from high above. But once is enough, as it's overpriced. The pavilion at the Cable Car boarding area has super mini rain-forest where kids can explore but that's about it..... Nothing else. Oh yeah, it has some restaurants and snack places...",,,
,,The Sky is the Limit,5,,"The cost per person for this attraction is $33 Singapore Dollars. If you take your Singapore Airline boarding card with you when you purchase your ticket for the flyer, you will receive a 20% discount. If you buy a Singapore Attraction Pass while you are still at the airport in Singapore you will get a great deal that covers many attractions in Singapore ....... a great buy if you are in town for a couple of days

You can see just about the whole of the harbour front when you fly this attraction and it is open both in the daytime and in the evening. We took the ride at 21:30 hrs.

Each pod that you travel in will carry approximately 14 people - there is some seating available, but not enough seating for every passenger which doesn't really matter as most people tend to walk around the pod whilst it is in rotation.

This is a super family attraction.",,,
,,Nice Scene View,4,,"A good try for the first time those who never try before. Take it easy inside the Flyer and good to have photograph when It reach the highest part. You can see the whole Singapore, Include Marina Bay Sands, Sentosa, River Cruise and other's building.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer - Amazing,5,,"We had a ride in this giant ferris wheel during our visit to Singapore and it was amazing.
The cabins are huge and spacious accommodating around 25-30 people. And the views from the wheel are amazing. You can view malaysian and Indonesian lands also from the wheel when at the topmost height , however the view is not clear and you would need a binocular to see it properly.

Takes almost 30 mins to complete a full rotation with some breath taking views.
Amazing..!!",,,
,,Been On others,1,,"These over sized Ferris Wheels are basically all the same weather it is Singapore, Melbourne, Paris or London the only difference is the view",,,
,,Great Place,5,,A nice and worth seeing place to visit. The large wheel gives you a very nice airiel view of Singapore and sea port. Like all other places in Singapore it is neat and clean and the slow movement of the wheel is very comfortable to even aged people.,,,
,,Slow steady Ride,4,,"this isn't the highest point in Singapore . Marina bay sands is even more higher than Singapore flyer. The ride is very slow that sometimes it makes u feel bored . If you are a avid photographer , you could take some real snaps .",,,
,,Mesmerizing experience,4,,"Singapore Flyer is a giant ferris wheel ride that lets you see the entire SIngapore city. The best time to visit is festive evening as the entire city if lit up and looks beautiful.

The buggy car (your ride on ferris wheel) is very spacious. It is like a big capsule with seating benches at centre. You can easily walk around and check out the beautiful city.",,,
,,Panorama view,4,,The Flyer was really once in a life time experience since me and my wife were all alone in one of the box of the flyer - since we took the flyer noon time - we really had a good view and taken lovely photos of the panorama view all round and also could see in the distance Malaysia,,,
,,Good 40 minutes,5,,"Try going after 6pm, moves slowly get the directions before you enter the flyer so you can differentiate Malaysia and Indonesia. If you are lucky and take the trip from 9-10pm, LASER show might be there.",,,
,,GOOOOD,5,,"Its great! You can see all of Singapore and also Indonesia ! The view is awesome but i recommend to go on it in the evening if that's possible, coz then you can see the city all lit up!",,,
,,great views,5,,"Awesome views of the city and beyond!! Loved it and would definitely do it again and recommend it to others. Although, only pick 1 city viewing option i would say - they would all see similar things",,,
,,Amazing!!!!!,5,,Omg!!!! this is amazing when you enter this you are in total ore of the size of it and when you start to move you will start clicking by taking so many photos of the beautiful scenery with the 360 degrees viewing. Didn't want it to end.Love it do much....,,,
,,Stunning Views,5,,"During our trip to Singapore, we had a ride at Singapore Flyer and it was a great experience... Could observe the most of the country by sitting in a cube. 360掳 Amazing views all over the ride. Should not be missed at all..",,,
,,Fantastic view,5,,"Truly a sight to behold, currently one of the largest of it's kind although Dubai are building a bigger one apparently. A bit on the expensive side but could spend quite a few hours in the immediate area",,,
,,Best time to visit = Evenings !,3,,"Try to go in evening so that its day when you are ascending and night when descending.

Give about 25mins for prevailed it formalities like information and queue. The round itself takes about 25 mins and provides a picturesque view of the Singapore CBD.

The nearest MRT station is Promenade at about 7-10 mins walking distance.

The park below the flyer is a cute little place to spend few minutes.

There are couple of restaurants, including an Indian restaurant and subway sandwiches.

There is a shop offering fish massage. Fishes are said to eat up dead skin from soul of your feet, in an extremely ticklish manner. After 4-5 mins the tickling sensation becomes bearable.

The view of the Singapore river and the sea is beautiful from level 2.

Nearby from flyer:
Esplanade theaters: 10-12 mins
Marina Bay Sands: 10 mins
Gardens by the bay: 12-15 mins

You will get cheaper tickets if you purchase from an agent. Young children below 3 or 4 years go free.",,,
,,Average,3,,"Everyone felt that this was a little average compared to the London Eye. Of course it should not be compared. The view is great and for the tourists that did not visit the London Eye before, this is worth it. But otherwise there is no point as there are other buildings like the Marina Bay Sands that have better view.",,,
,,The wheel,3,,"Really, it is only a big wheel. We were very lucky and decided to go early. The weather was clear and the views were good. Other days, you could be disappointed by the haze. It's a hit or miss.",,,
,,An Evening Visit to Singapore Flyer,4,,"After having been there before too, in the day time during a previous trip to Singapore, we went by the advice of some locals to enjoy the ride during evening time, when the lights are switched on. Well yes, it was definitely a better experience than the previous one, and it was a great delight ! The beauty of Singapore shines out much more during the evening time when it is all lighted up all around.",,,
,,good,5,,Singapore flyer is a giant rotating wheel which takes a round in 30 mins & the travellers get a 360 degree view of singapore city. Its better to go around 6:15 pm coz of both day & night views. Its amazing....shouldn't be missed,,,
,,A must in singapore!,5,,We really enjoy the scenery up thre..paid only 33dollar.and its worth of our money with the awesome sight of the city!,,,
,,Ride with a view,4,,visited on 22nd Feb 2015 - afternoon cost of the ride S$78 for 2 adult + 1 kid total ride time is 25min. approximately 17-20people in one capsule. the experience is great and view stunning. Enjoyed thoroughly. Must ride once in Singapore,,,
,,"Nice, sometimes crowded",5,,"We booked Dining at the Top, so we skip the queue which was also very long even late at night. It was a great and expensive experience. Only one thing whitch was distracting was reflection in windows during the night.",,,
,,Best place to enjoy City Skyline,5,,The view atop the skyline is just unmatched.... You can see the Garden by the bay and marina sands at the far end as well.... The capsules move slow.... Therefore a traveller gets enough time to enjoy themselves...,,,
,,Flying High,5,,"This is a MUST for any visitor to Singapore.
We have now done the London Eye, the Melbourne Star (previously Southern Star) and the Singapore Flyer..and this wins hands down.
Easy to access / Far more Ambiance / Beautifully Landscaped / Far more to see with a wider expanse...
And make sure you have your camera...",,,
,,nice experience,4,,"we liked it. we were there at night, so could see bay at night which is really great. Cabins are very big - you can even have a dinner in some. Good air-conditioner. Not very easy accessible - need a bit of walking from metro. After long day as we had it was bit tough. Otherwise worth going.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,3,,"Overrated, over priced, u spent approximately 10 minutes in the highest part for the view and the rest near the floor, I didn't think it was worth the money",,,
,,Amazing Views of the City,5,,If you have and hour or so to spend then this is a great way to see the City and Harbour of Singapore. A smooth comfortable ride which is air conditioned and views that will leave you breathless.,,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,Well worth the visit with great views and the cabins are air conditioned which is great. They are very easy to hop on and off even if your mobility is not good.,,,
,,Must go,4,,"Yes it is a ferris wheel but this is definitely more than just that.

We had an 8m old baby and strollers are not allowed into the capsules so we carried out baby in.

The view was amazing. It takes 30mins for one revolution. Great photo opportunities of the city!",,,
,,brilliant experience,5,,A great experience for all the family. There is hardly any movement when in the cubicle so no movement sickness. A great way to spend an hour.... amazing,,,
,,great ride,5,,loved the views of the city. I thought I had seen it all from the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands but this view is a little different and gives you a wider view of the city and also great views of the formula one track.,,,
,,Good views,4,,a little bit distant from marina bay but great panoramic views across the city. A little pricey. Was very quiet with no wait.,,,
,,Best Views ever,5,,It was a truly amazing 30 mins the weather was nice and sunny and we were able to see Indonesian from the highest point.,,,
,,Almost all the city is on your feet,4,,"We visit there is the daytime so it's not crowded. It takes around 30 minutes to go from the bottom through the top and then back to the bottom again. The view from the cabin is good, the harbor, Sands, skyscraper can all be seen.",,,
,,Worth Visiting,5,,"When I first viewed the Singapore flyer I thought it was a lot smaller than I imagined. Once I boarded, no waiting time, I was surprised how high it actually was. Great views over the city and port. Would definitely go again but at night next time. Well worth the money.",,,
,,Wonderful View,5,,"Very excited to have the chance to view Singapore from different angles, really enjoyed taking so many photo's, so well positioned & easy to get to after being on the one in Melb for the first time we were very happy to enjoy one even higher with out the fear of height great eating places around much to see a must to do in Singapore",,,
,,Fabulous Views!,4,,"We did this trip in the evening after visiting the Marina Bay Sands area. It was a short walk over, and there were no lineups. Cost is $33 Singapore Dollars (pretty much on a par with the Canadian Dollar). The ride is 30 minutes. You do one complete loop, and it doesn't stop. You just step into the glass enclosed car and you're off. There were only 4 other people in with 4 of us, so the photo ops were very good, except for the reflections of the flashing lights. You have to choose your photo opportunities wisely. The views are fantastic.
Before you get on there is a long route to get there (for when there are line ups I imagine). Many details of the how's and whys of the construction of the wheel, which is very interesting. Well worth the ride.
You can also pay more for a champagne ride, and I think there were other choices as well. We loved it. Comparable to the London Eye, but the lights of Singapore outshine the ones on the Thames!",,,
,,Spectacular view over Singapore,4,,It is a must do when in Singapore. You get to see a panoramic view over the whole Singapore. The wheel itself is a tech wonder since every capsule spins itself and has air conditioning,,,
,,Great view,5,,Really brilliant view and attraction night or day . But expensive . Can be booked for Grand Prix ! That would be trilling .,,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,"Beautiful views of Singapore, best time to go i think is at night when the city is lit up. Highly recommend this tour a must do experience.",,,
,,Brilliant view!,5,,Every visitor to Singapore should take the Singapore Flyer as first the cabin was really spacious and sleek and offers really good views. The small museum leading to the flyer was also informative. There are also many good restaurants there and one could go to the nearby shopping malls after visiting the flyer.,,,
,,Great view of the city,4,,We did the Singapore Flyer in the evening. It was a great view of the city. It was also very peaceful. We had our own cart which was nice and got to take lots of pictures of the city. You see the city/country from every angle.,,,
,,Stunning Views,4,,"Having gone on the London Eye late last year, I have to say that this impressed me far more than that.
The basic idea is the same - a big wheel that takes a while to rotate, with stunning views. Both do that part very well, but in London the Eye has almost nothing around it. Here you have shops, eateries and the whole place is just a lot more impressive. I understand that in London they had less space and had to fit it into an already crowded area, but the whole thing just feels like it has a lot less thought put into it than the Singapore Flyer.
Oh, and just as importantly, the views of the Marina Bay are stunning!",,,
,,Nice Views,3,,"Expensive for a slow 20 minute ride. $33 per adult but if you travel with Singapore airlines , keep your receipt as you get a discount.",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,Such a great attraction to visit. Amazing views of the Singapore city and harbour. Well worth the S$32 dollar fee. From 165m high you can see a long way!,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,We went in the early evening when you get the views by daylight and get to see the city lit up as the ride continues,,,
,,Wow,5,,"Not a fan of heights but the Singapore Flyer was very well organised. Went during the week so was quiet with little queue. Nice to see security in place.

Amazing views over that part of Singapore and out to Marina Bay. Seats available in middle if you wish to sit. Airconditioned comfort. Would recommend.",,,
,,Good views over Singapore,4,,"Went on the Singapore Flyer today ...... It is VERY high, pods are air conditioned and have piped music which unfortunately in our pod became a loud buzz which was a bit annoying for the 30 mins it takes to complete the rotation. When we mentioned this to the attendants at the end of the ride they did offer us another ride, however one was enough for us. Good views across the city but not for people who don't like heights.",,,
,,the giant ferris wheel,3,,"was not really interested, but my friend ask me to join.
the view was just so so, maybe because we already visited altitude and we also stayed in 35th floor hotel.
the city view surely will looked nice in the evening.
be careful if u have old timers with u, because the wheel wont stop when we get in / get out.
it was only half an hour more or less.",,,
,,WOW...The capsule...,4,,Lovely way u can see Singapore...u must do this twice one in the morning and evening...excellent dinning facility,,,
,,Fantastic at night,5,,"I took the flyer in the evening and the view of the lights over the city was fantastic.
I'm sure it is beautiful in the daytime too but I particularly want to see the lights and it was well worth it. There were no queues either!",,,
,,A ferris wheel unlike any other,5,,When my husband saw the Flyer he said no way! Then realized it moves so slow that you could never get sick on it. It took 40 minutes to go around and moves so slow that you actually get on while it is moving. This was so much fun we would recommend it to anyone wanting to get a birds eye view of Singapore.,,,
,,So high,4,,I am nervous of heights but this was lovely. I felt safe. If you want a seat you have to grab one as limited seating but plenty of room to move. The views are just great. Takes about a half an hour to complete a circuit. A bit expensive but do it once!,,,
,,Nice view,5,,Once you visited Singapore it is deserve to ride this. It is not cheap but you can easily overview the beautiful Singapore city!,,,
,,Still nice after 4th time,5,,Because it was off peak. We got the whole capsule for ourselves. It is still nice eventhough it was my 4th visit. With the new subway line.. It cannot get any easier to flyer.,,,
,,Very good,5,,Great place to go to get a birds eye view of the city. You can see just how compact Singapore is and why it is so easy to get around. Get there early and have something to eat at one of the great little eateries.,,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"I've done this during the day and at night. Try both! Singapore is ever changing, you'll see something different on each visit to this amazing city.",,,
,,Must visit,5,,A must visit while in Singapore. Best time to get on it is when the sun sets and the city lights up. It takes about 30min to complete a lap so gives you ample time to take photo's.,,,
,,Wonderful experience,5,,"First of we thaught it is only a giant wheel of big size and afraid to take a ride on looking to it's height. But we took the ride after the advise of the guide and enjoyed a lot.
It is the highest flyer in Asia,and safest as we take rounds in a Capsule and moves slowly.We can see the buty of the Singapore and take pictures. But we feelthat the fee is over priced
I strongly suggest that every body irrespective of the age can take the flyer at Singapore",,,
,,Well organised - good views,4,,"Getting in was fine - wasn't expecting a mini type museum giving history of the flyer and how it was constructed - we had picked a good day when few crowds so it was a lot easier to view - this may be more difficult when there are lots of people heading for the pods.
The views were stunning of the city and there was no feeling of movement- it was so slick. The duration of the journey was 30 minutes and if you get good weather it is worth it. We booked on line and this saved queuing. As with all attractions there are the obligatory photo s as you get on the pod - and tacky souvenirs upon leaving . There are a large amount of food outlets which cater for all tastes and as with everything in Singapore - it was clean.",,,
,,Good if you have time,3,,"It does give a nice view of the city and the harbour, but if you have already gone to a bar or some restaurants on the top of buildings (like sky57 in marina bay sands) the view is not any different to be worth the price.",,,
,,A great way to take in the view,4,,"This was kinda cool. You were able to sit or stand and take in the views of Singapore. This is a magical and beautiful city, so getting the view from up top of the Singapore Flyer was breathtaking. Everyone should do this at least once.",,,
,,Not too bad. Great view,4,,It was a very warm day when my wife and I took the Singapore Flyer. Nonetheless it was a great experience - wonderful view with attentive staff. Thank you for the experience. I probably won't come back but it's definitely a great one-time experience worth the pictures.,,,
,,The Largest Wheel in The World,5,,"We were fortunate when we visited the Singapore Flyer as the waiting time was practically zero. A trip is referred to as a flight & each cabin takes twenty eight people, however on our trip we shared with only six others which enables you to take photos & move around easily.",,,
,,Worth a trip - try at sunset on a nice day,5,,"Incredible views over all of Singapore from the Flyer. Pick a nice day and maybe try going around sunset for the best views. You can also dine on board, but we did not do that. Great photo ops to the Marina Bay Sands and the Gardens below",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,4,,"We went on this attraction early in the morning when it opened. There weren't many people in our capsule (about 5 others). The price for an adult ticket is S$33. The full circle is about 30 minutes where you get to see the skyline, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands and views of this city. There is also a short display prior to going on the wheel regarding its construction, etc...Really enjoyed our visit. We then walked to Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay afterwards.",,,
,,Just like the London eye,5,,"great view of the city from the ride, not too expensive and some nice ice cream stall there, also a good view of the F1 track.",,,
,,Excellent views,4,,"Visited the Flyer for the fabulous views of Singapore. We had no queues and the price was very reasonable. There are options to get a souvenir photo for your trip for a extra cost which is collected in the shop at the end of the tour. We had good weather, so great views for the whole 30 minutes. If you don't mind heights - it a great trip.
If you happens to visit during the F1 GP, your grand Prix ticket includes a ride on the Flyer for free.",,,
,,Great place to see Singapore.,4,,This is a large wheel like the London Eye.You get some great views and start to understand where things are at ground level.A great place for photo opportunities. There is also a chance to try some local food at the base.,,,
,,Beautiful views of the city,3,,Nice way to cool off on a hot day with great views of the city. Very comfortable to sit or stand in the compartments while you go around.,,,
,,"The view of Singapore Flyer is better, than the view from it",5,,"It is necessary to visit for ""mark"": I was on the highest flyer in the world. Photos from the booth are not so cool because of glass. In booth it is cold. The view impresses not so much. From an observation deck of Gardens by the Bay the view is more impressive.",,,
,,Expensive but an excellent view of Singapore,4,,"We visited the flyer in the evening after we landed. It wasn't very far from our hotel. Very happy to see that there was not much of rush. We were not in any waiting queue. In the 28 min of the flyer ride, we were delighted to see the view of Singapore. It was so beautiful! Also, we saw the light show at the gardens by the bay which looked near the flyer as we were going up. The view is harder to describe but one of an experience",,,
,,Go at night for best views of the city,5,,"We went at 21.30 and went straight on the flyer.(Last ""flight"" 22.00) The revolution was 30 minutes and panoramic views were wonderful.If you happen to be over 60 you enjoy a discount !",,,
,,"Nice view, but....",3,,"I think, there is better views over Singapore, that are less expensive and not time limited. Maybe it is not my kind of thing anyway, a flyer, but if you go up to to 1 Altitude (weather and venue permitting), you get better value for money and a better overall view over the city - and in the evenings a drink included....wednesday-nights even free for the ladies, if I remember correctly. The waiting times at the flyer can also be an issue somtimes. As a classical Singapore attraction, it is still a must go and see, but if you do not just want to go through your checklist - you can ignore it I think!",,,
,,Awesome view,5,,"We went on the Singapore Flyer at night. Magnificent view of all of Singapore. Very clear night. Easy to buy tickets. Lots of eating places before getting on with cheap prices so I would recommend going to eat there. The Flyer is very close to the Marina Bay shopping area which we walked through afterwards. We also attended a Chinese New Year celebration at the race track afterwards, free entry, entertainment and again cheap food stalls. Then we walked across the Double Helix Bridge.

Helix Bridge.",,,
,,Great Views even on an overcast day,4,,We booked in advance - its slightly cheaper - you just pick the day you want to go and turn up any time. There were only 6 people in our capsule which meant we could move around and get great views in every direction.,,,
,,Superb,5,,"Great value for money, great views and the staff are very helpful.
We went about 1000 and it was quiet, had a pod to ourselves.
Price is about 拢15 each and it is the highest wheel built so far, but very smooth, I do not like heights but not a problem with this.

The views are spectacular a great way to see the city.",,,
,,Lovely ...,5,,The Singapore flyer is a good experience for anyone who hasn't had any similar experience either in London or Japan. It is a slow moving wheel (no reason for any fear) which gives a 20-30 minute ride giving the views of the entire Singapore city and outskirts. Its a little expensive but good to do if you have the time and its the first expereince,,,
,,bird eye view of singapore,5,,great experience had a wonderful view on Singapore well organized and very little waiting time and the carriages not over packed with people,,,
,,Not as good as Melbourne Wheel,4,,"- the staff member who sold us the ticket was unfriendly, unsmiling, dull. She should quit.

- not a long wait to get on

- we were put in a cabin with families with 3 small children who cried during the journey

- there is no recorded information explaining what you're looking at, where to look etc

- the views are amazing

- Melbourne Star Observation Wheel is done a lot better",,,
,,Outstanding views,4,,"From far away, it almost appears that the carriage is not moving. But it does move very slowly and steady. The carriage is spacious and offers outstanding views. It is also conveniently located within walking distance of metro station. Afterwards, we walked over to the Theatre on the Esplanade. It made a very nice afternoon.",,,
,,Views were brilliant,5,,I am very nervous on these large wheels and spent a bit of time wondering why i had gone on it. But glad i forced myself and my wife didnt make to much fun of me sitting away from windows shaking like a leaf. Did relax a little eventually and still thought it is an awesome piece of engineering.,,,
,,Great views of Singapore,4,,"to take good pictures and get great views of Singapore, just visit the flyer. You can be lucky to get a cart by yourselves.",,,
,,Superb treat suitable for anyone.,5,,"My 13 years old grand daughter (who thought she would be frightened) and myself took the flyer on a perfect day. It`s easy to get on and off and it`s so gentle. If it were not for the ever changing spectacular views, you would hardly know you were moving. The view really is stunning and it`s easy to appreciate the traditional and ultra modern, and to see the amazing amount of land reclamation. My grand daughter was amazed and she thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The interpretation panels as we approached were also very interesting. Well done Singapore.",,,
,,Up Up and Away,5,,"Even my husband who doesn't like heights was fine with this. The flyer moves so slow that you don't even notice how high you are, and the capsule is large - we had at least 12 people in ours. The view is fantastic - at night it's just magical!",,,
,,Awesome View,5,,"I suggest the visitor to visit this place @ night. With the lights it look beautiful. While the capsule went to its peak you can see the whole beautiful and colorful Singapore. Its a breathtaking moment for me while i see those tremendous views.

Its simply A W E S O M E ...",,,
,,Simply Breathtaking!,5,,"What a view!!!! If you wanna experience something new and exotic, this is the place to be! Well managed and lovely place. Went there during my anniversary outing to Singapore. If you are in Singapore, this is a Must watch place!",,,
,,WOW the sights of Singapore,5,,"We have seen this location from our hotel room, it looked fantastic, so off we went and had a tour of Singapore at night, it was so good, you could see every thing with such clarity and the cleanest City in the world as a backdrop.",,,
,,Great view!,4,,The Singapore Flyer was a good experience and the view was worth the cost. It was very efficient - virtually no waiting time when we went mid-afternoon.,,,
,,Nice sunset view!,4,,"We timed going here to catch the sunset. When you go in, there are tons of things to see before you actually get into one of the cable cars. There's cool, interactive displays and its a good way to pass time if you're waiting to get on the flyer at a specific time. We bought the basic entrance pass which got us in a cable car that held approximately 15 people. The cable cars are big enough and it did not feel crowded at all and everyone still got to see everything comfortably in the flyer. If you want the experience to be a bit more special, you can pay a little more and have a private cable car and drink a Singapore Slinger. If not, the basic package is still great!",,,
,,Loved it!!,5,,"We went here on our visit to Singapore we went during the morning we had brought a pass called I-venture which included a ride on the flyer among other places. We collected our tickets from guest service on the bottom floor of the flyer building the staff there are fantastic they ask you to sit down and relax while they are sorting the tickets.

Once we got our tickets we went to the 1st floor where you give your tickets and go through the coolest security I have ever been through with a fake x-Ray machine showing fun images then you go through some fun different displays. We were very lucky as there was only a 3-5 minute wait which we were happy with. Once you are in you are in a pod with about 14 people in total I am guessing that was because it was quiet not sure if it's more people in the night.

You are in the pod for about half hour and they announce when your at the top the views are amazing as you can walk around you can find the perfect place to take a picture.",,,
,,Bird's eye view of the city - An absolute delight!,4,,"This was on our must-see list in Singapore. We were awaiting the experience of this giant-giant-giant capsule that provides a magnificent view of the city. People say you can also see the neighboring country - Malaysia. Well, we didn't really try figuring that out though! It was a day when we saw light rainfall hence the view of the city was really beautiful. The entire one round takes about 30 minutes and is an absolute delight.",,,
,,Best visited at dusk !,5,,"SIngapore Flyer is a must visit place for tourists in SIngapore.

The best time to visit is at dusk, as it gives us the view of the Singapore skyline at sunset and at night because of the time it takes to complete a round (45 - 50 min ). However, there would be a large queue as most visitors would opt for these timings.

If you would like to avoid the queue, then i would suggest you to go early in the morning at about 10 AM and you would easily complete the visit in an hour.

Also, the wheel can be rented for parties and celebrations, which makes it a unique attraction in Singapore.",,,
,,Enjoy lots,5,,"great view of the city, no worry, anyone can enjoy, must visit if you are visiting Singapore, better to take during city tour",,,
,,Good way to get a birds eye view.,4,,"Being a big wheel the Flyer gives you a really good view over the harbour and CBD area of the city. It takes about 30 minutes to do 1 revolution and in that time you'll get great views of the surrounding area, from the countless ships at see and stunning 'Gardens by the Bay' to the large variety of architecture.
The view is always changing with plenty to see through the mainly glass capsule, however it's definitely not for people with an issue with heights.
The evening 'flights' are particularly beautiful as you'll have a birds eye view of the city all lit up.
There are a big variety of 'flights' available including a butler service!

There are a number of restaurants, bars and shops available within the complex around the flyer.

If you want some good views of Singapore check this out.",,,
,,Good View,4,,Singapore Flyer is far way from city centre. But the experience is very good. It take exactly 30 min to complete 1 full round where you can see the best views of singapore including the bay and marina. Quite expensive ride.,,,
,,Good way to See Singpore,5,,"The waiting time wasn't long at all. Pace of the flight was slow and enjoyable. We where able to take really good aerial pictures.

The customer service people where really welcoming and we also liked the fact that there was some history to read on the walls as you go into the loading point.

Am scared of heights but after 5 mins of flight time I was able to stand comfortable and enjoyed every moment of the fun.

Tickets prices were reasonable. I believe we paid $25 (Singaporean $) each",,,
,,Amazing view but ticket to expensive,4,,I went with my friends and it was on a good weather sunny you can view everything clearly. Beautiful sights. It will take you about 30 for a full circle. Only problem is the ticket pricing is a little steep,,,
,,Great View,5,,"It is amazing to see all over Singapore from it. Nice view and beautiful, especially at night. My daughter love it very much and she was exciting :)",,,
,,The London Eye of Singapore,4,,"The Singapore flyer is located near the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Marina Bay Gardens. It is open 8:30 Am to 10 pm. It cost 33 Singapore Dollars a person for a 30 minute ride. There are other things to see there as well. We were not charged the GST, which was nice. If you don't stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the Singapore Flyer is advised. The lines are short and it gives you a good overview of the Marina area.",,,
,,Excellent view of the city,5,,I did the Singapore Flyer around noon and it was a hot day. I would recommend late afternoon to see the sunset.,,,
,,Good view,4,,You tzake this for a good view over the city and harbour area. There is no commentary or information so take a guidebook. It is a pleasant way to spend 30 minutes in air-conditioning.,,,
,,Trip around the Singapore Flyer,5,,"Took the Singapore Flyer as a way to spending the start of chinese new year. Ticketing was quite quick, and the cue to the wheel it self was reasonable (15-20 min), you will have a great view over Marina Bay, and downtown Singapore from the Singapore Flyer.",,,
,,Amazing birds eye view of the city,5,,"The Singapore flyer takes about 30 min to rotate once, so you get adequate time to enjoy the view and click photos. You hardly feel it moving and the panoramic view of Singapore is just amazing. We went there late in the evening, so that we could see the city after sunset, from the streets to the multitude of tall buildings, all of them brightly lit up.",,,
,,Great views!,4,,"Visited the Singapore Flyer by myself as my partner is afraid of heights - but can I just say, I hate heights too and you don't really feel how high it actually is and the view is fantastic!

This was the highest observation wheel in the world until just recently, and it does offer 360 degree views of Singapore.

But, from visiting other observation wheels such as the London eye, what was disappointing is that once you get in the pod, you have about 40 mins of taking photos and nothing else. What I think they need to add is voice overs and images on the screens pointing out different landmarks, and show the best places to stand in the pod to take photos with various landmarks.",,,
,,Great view at night,4,,"I wouldn't say that it is a must see, but it is quite fun. Just don't worry if you didn't go, it's not a one in a lifetime thing.",,,
,,Worth the Money,5,,"The flyer was great but when we got to Sentosa Island we were very dissapointed, very comercialised and overpriced.",,,
,,Briliant,4,,"We went on the flyer as part of a organised tour, it was around 8.30pm, there were virtually no wait, the views even at night were magnificent, highly recommended. Well organised, the pods were clean offering a full 360% view.",,,
,,Amazing views of Singapore - Do it!,5,,The Singapore Flyer is a peaceful way to see the sights of Singapore.The wheel slowly rotates around in about 30 minutes with a constantly varying view of the sights. We did it in he early morning (9am) and had the whole capsule to ourselves. I would highly recommend this to someone new to the city to get your bearings and figure out what to see next.,,,
,,Wonderful view,5,,Amazing view from the top. It must be on everyone's itinerary. The scenic beauty and the skyscraper of the city is clearly visible. One can see the city 360 degree. Price is $27~33.,,,
,,Must do when visiting Singapore,4,,"What an amazing experience, best I have ever been on. 360 views and very stable carriage. The views of Singapore from here were just amazing. The precinct that the wheel is in has everything with a lovely little tropical garden in the middle to sit and relax. The 6D experience is worth a try is very exhilarating and lots of fun.",,,
,,Spectacular Views,5,,We visited this at night time and had a pod to ourself. What a view! Its spectacular to see so far. Would be worth seeing during the day also - sunset would be the perfect time.,,,
,,First time on Flyer,5,,"I highly recommend tis Singapore Flyer. Very Similar of the Ferris Wheel in London, England and you have the view of the whole city of Singapore. And you also have a view of Sentosa Island, Golf Course, Gardens of the bay, and many more. I wished I could stay longer in SIngapore but next year, I'll be staying in Singapore longer for sure.",,,
,,Stunning,5,,"Most cities now have a wheel but as we've never been on one before, we thought this might be a great place to start. Again the public transport took us directly there. We arrived quite early and we were in a capsule with another 10 people, so we had plenty of room. The town map we got prior to boarding was able to identify the main buildings and places of interest as we travelled. The views were spectacular and this is well worth a visit while in Singapore",,,
,,Good view,4,,"The Flyer is quite nice and You can enjoy the fantastic view of singapore, I suggest you to go at night and the view will be better. But is just 20 mins, it's too short. I prefer longer.",,,
,,Once round on the flyer,5,,"Excellent value as we had a free pass provided by Singapore Air! Well worth paying though for the stunning views you get of Marina Bay and the rest of the down town area of Singapore. Cabins are air conditioned so no problem with getting too hot. Not too much of a queue either when we were there, about 5 mins",,,
,,"""Amazing place""",4,,"Thats was like dream.. but all of that's true.. amazing view ,, we can see all of singapore from the singapore flyer i think.. xoxoxo a great moment",,,
,,disappointed,3,,Not a patch on the London eye. Humid atmosphere gives an unclear scene. Pods are clean and customer friendly and feel safe. Some parts of thr viewing are amazing.,,,
,,Excellent views,5,,Amazing views - well worth having a flight - took about half hour. Plenty of room in the Pod - not crowded. Easy to take lovely photos whilst moving of the fabulous views.,,,
,,Full City View from the Top,5,,"Can see the full city view from the top, Singapore Flyer will take 1 round in 30 mins and Nice Experience.",,,
,,Must see views.,5,,"This is one of those things that's almost compulsory to do in Singapore. The views are just breath taking! From the ships in the harbour to the city scape there is just so much to see. We had no issues with queues as we went in the late afternoon but I would suggest if possible to be selective as to who is on your trip. Its a relatively confined space and there is no escaping your companions, at least not for the 40 minutes the trip takes. Otherwise this is a highly recommended attraction.",,,
,,More Than Just A Big Wheel,4,,"Most major cities have something similar to the Flyer so there is no surprises that the views over the city and Singapore island are spectacular on a clear sunny day. What most people who visit may not know is there are a number of other attractions in the same building as well as outside - all well worth a visit - the Flight Simulator Experience trainer on the second floor lets you fly a Boeing 737NG with a trained and qualified pilot in the other ""seat"" and a choice of airports to take off from and land.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"A wonderful experience, everybody should try. Great views and a pleasant atmosphere. There are a lot of souvenirs to buy",,,
,,Nice place but bit expensive,4,,I have been to flyer last year. Nice experience. Close to that of London Eye. But if you plan to visit Marina Bay Sands Skypark then reconsider this.,,,
,,A good way to get your bearings,4,,"We went on the flyer on our first day in Singapore - it was a great way to see where everything was and if you are short on time this will give you a really good birds eye view of Singapore.

The trip around takes about 30 minutes and if you are organised you can pre-book on line.",,,
,,Sky High Delight,4,,The flyer does a thirty minute rotation so there is plenty of opportunity for lots of photos. Each cabins airconditined with seating. When youarewaiting,,,
,,An awe-mazing view of singapore's landmarks.,5,,"As a person that is really interested in singapore's history, im really amazed at the location of the flyer and how we can see all the landmarks from the top",,,
,,Excellent nightview,5,,"Went there in evening, can capture an excellent nightview of Sands, Supertrees, the coast, worth to go. And we saw the 50 th Singapore anniversay parade by accident too, really great!",,,
,,High above Singapore on the Flyer,5,,"If you've been to London and gone on the London Eye, don't dismiss the Singapore Flyer, as it's even better and has much more to see!",,,
,,Only go in good weather,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is definitely one of the top attractions in Singapore. Located on Marina Bay close to the Grand Prix start / finish straight it offers excellent and ever changing views over central Singapore and the coast.
There is a food court located under the flyer, however, the food quality is average and the prices are high due to the tourist location. Getting to the flyer requires quite a long walk from City Hall MRT so best to arrive by taxi.
If it looks like it is going to thunder choose another activity. The flyer is closed during thunder storms and getting a taxi out is difficult.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"I went there in the night, the view is breathtaking, the movement is really slow you can barely feel it. Only problem is the price. A bit expensive.",,,
,,Well worth the visit,4,,"Our visit to the Singapore Flyer was very enjoyable. Luckily, it was a fine, clear day and we got a great view of the surrounding areas.",,,
,,High in the Sky,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is gigantic! Warning: If you are very scared of heights this ride is not for you(so step out of the line and get out)! The view is picturesque! It is definitely a must see sight in Singapore! For me, it was a fun experience and I hope you will also have fun on the Singapore Flyer too!",,,
,,Overprice and nothing to see.,3,,"Probably the only goid view is to the east of Singapore where it's unblock.
One side of the Flyers are sky scrapers so your view is basically crap. And there's nothing much out on the sea except for all the container ships all over the place.
The Marina Bay Sands Sky Park is cheaper and taller.",,,
,,Fly on the Tallest Wheel in thw World,5,,"This was a magnificent attraction. Larger than the The Eye in London. We travelled on this free of charge using our Singapore Holidays Stopover vouchers. We carefully picked our time of travel by looking at the weather at about 9am in the morning - clear blue skies not a hint of incoming cloud. So we thought that we should get spectacular views and we were right! This really is a worthwhile experience taking over 30 minutes to do a full circle. Different views every minute over both the city, the bay and the gardens. Highly recommended.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,This is a must do when visiting Singapore. If you happen to buy a Red Bus all day ticket then you will qualify for a reduction on the ticket price for the Flyer. Try and pick a clear day as the views are amazing.,,,
,,Great view,5,,We went at night and were lucky enough to be able to watch the dress rehursal for New Year parade taking place below us .You go over the Grand Prix course so it would be amasing to take a ride when that was on .thoughly recomend this trip.,,,
,,Its good if you have a group of people that have not been to Singapore,3,,"As the group of 18 people that I took them to the flyers were new to this and many of them had not been to Singapore for a whole, hence, they were amazed by the sight of Singapore seeing from the flyer. Personally, I did not enjoy it too much but with 18 people and we have the whole cart bourselces, it's not too bad. It would be better if it is higher than marina sands so that we can see the pool and the swimmers in the pool",,,
,,The Flyer,4,,Great way to start a guest visit by getting unique view of the city. I take guests there early in the city to point out land marks and explain a bit about how SG is design around Feng Shui.,,,
,,Always great fun,5,,"Admitted, it is a touristic thing. But if you're here, just go for it. It is nice to see Singapore from this perspective. Seriously.",,,
,,Great,4,,Worth taking the flyer to get the overall view of the city and beyond . It is slow paced so plenty of photo opportunities. You can upgrade to have afternoon tea,,,
,,Great experience for couples,4,,"Its not just an ordinary flyer its romantic , fabulous and nite. Its near the marina sand bay. Couples will enjoy the romantic view of Singapore",,,
,,Go early,5,,"We visited the flyer at about 10am and there was hardly anyone in the queue. The flyer gives you an amazing slow rotation view of Singapore which, for a first time visitor like myself, is worth doing.",,,
,,SPECTACULAR VIEWS,5,,We went to the flyer during the day after the DUCK TOUR.. Its worth visiting and gives great views of the city. The pre flight exhibition is nothing great.. Amazing and a must do,,,
,,Ride of 30 min............,5,,singapore flyer awsome ride for the 30 min. every angle you stand is photogenic awsome experince at the peek of the flyer. like to ride one more time in future.,,,
,,must do,5,,"we went on the Singapore Flyer. A totally different perspective of the place. Nothing like the crappy one we have in Brisbane, this one is huge.",,,
,,Going round in circles in a glass bubble,2,,About as much fun as taking a see-through elevator that is very slow and going nowhere. Better to spend a nice evening in the many high rise restaurants with a view that are available here.,,,
,,Nehh,3,,"Singapore is a small city. It is not that awesome though if you're there for a short period, it would be a brief picture about singapore.",,,
,,Magic Views,4,,The views are amazing from the flyer. It does take a little time to go around so you may have to keep the kids occupied.,,,
,,Good One,4,,"Its not a wow one, but if you have time and want to see singapore's marina bay from the higher place, you make take may take the flyer. Recommendations are to go for it during the day or late noon.",,,
,,A Short Spin,4,,"30minutes spin to see the top of Singapore, really nice and peaceful. Good for a short getaway, even if a little bit out of the way.",,,
,,A must when visiting Singapore and enjoying a view from the top,5,,"Another great attraction in Singapore to enjoy. Although nothing is really cheap the money is nevertheless well spent. A 35 min ride takes you almost to the swimming pool level of Marina Bay Sands. Airconditioned cabins make it a comfortable ride and the 360 degree view is just breathtaking. Marina Bay Sands, F1 pit building, Gardens by the Bay, the central business district (CBD), Singapore river etc. Take a ride late afternoon at around 5 pm on a sunny day, the light is just phenomenal at this time. From there you may proceed to Marina Bay via Helix Bridge. A great afternoon.",,,
,,Definite to-do while in singapore,4,,"Having been on the flyer twice, a few recommendation:
1. Don't go during peak hours (weekends or holidays), the queue can be long and once inside, it is harder to move and see all of the city.

2. Use the bathroom ahead of time, especially if with small kids. It is a 30 min trip. If the queue is long, expect over an hour for everything.

3. Try to go at dusk. You will be able to see the city with natural light, the sunset is great, and he city will start turning on its lights.

4. The best time to go is mid week after work (get dinner in one of the restaurants, and then head to the flyer.",,,
,,Take the flyer off-peak and it's an oasis of peace to take in the impossible city island n create your own perspective!,4,,"If you are not in a huge hurry and need some time to reflect n contemplate your journey with a panaromic sight for inspiration, do the flyer. Although it's not something I'll do again in a hurry, I didn't regret ""flying"" in slow mo",,,
,,Best View of Singapore,3,,This is one of the many places where you can catch a good view of Singapore but definitely not the cheapest... The view that is featured on all tourist brochures. I personally prefer the night or evening view and great for photo opportunities if you have a good camera. Best to visit after you have seen Singapore a little and can spot some of the interesting places from your Flyer capsule.,,,
,,Flyer,5,,"A great way to spend a couple of hours and enjoy a first class view of Singapore,especially the harbour.You can see for miles around.Highly recomended.",,,
,,awsome,5,,"the view from the wheel is magnificent, we choose to do it during the day so we could see as much as possible, and what a beautiful sight of Singapore. the cost was reasonable, the wheel moves very slow so there is plenty of time to sightsee.",,,
,,A must do at night,5,,"We saved this one for a night time, I really believe that Singapore comes to life after dark, so it was a great way to see it. It takes about 1/2 to go around and we enjoyed it.",,,
,,Nyeh,3,,"I mean, it's just one of the places in Singapore that you just gotta go at least once... because it's iconic. Not great. Considering you can get a more breath taking view from most of the hotel nearby....",,,
,,Fantastic Experience,5,,I was just terrified at first as I am not fond of heights with glass surrounds. But it moves very slowly and once moving the scenery makes you forget the fear. It was not the best of weather but it was amazing and it meant there was no queue. It could be said it was a little expensive but at the end of the experience I think it was worth it.,,,
,,SINGAPORE FLYER,5,,A great piece of construction where I understand one can have dinner on the wheel - we did no do this but visited the restaurant onsite,,,
,,What Views,5,,We shared a cabin with two other couples so had plenty of room to see everything. Fantastic views over Down Town Singapore and Gardens By The Bay.,,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"At first one would assume to be a normal flyer, but hang on, it offers stunning views of Singapore. It completes on e round in around 35-40 minutes and offers ample opportunity to get clicked with stunning back drops.",,,
,,Very nice...,5,,"Very nice indeed, 30 minutes ride worth it. Will come back with the kids and have a lunch too. You can take the MRT to get there.",,,
,,Expensive Views,3,,"We booked online in advance because I was worried the queue here would rival The Eye in London - no such worry! There was no line at all and we shared our capsule with only two other women. It was a clear day and the views were spectacular....but if you are on a budget, I would skip the Flyer and instead pay the $5 to do the Supertrees walk at Gardens By the Bay - the view isn't as good or as comprehensive but it is still incredible and a lot cheaper.

The disappointment with the Flyer is that there is no explanation at all as to what you are seeing. At The Eye in London, for example, the interior of the capsules have a picture map so that you can identify the landmarks that you see. There's nothing like there here, which is disappointing, especially for the money you pay.

There is an introduction to the creation of the Flyer as you enter the building but, frankly, we skipped it as it didn't hold any interest for us. In the area around the Flyer there is a food court that is meant to look like a foodie street of the past. The atmosphere is kind of cool but the food wasn't very good.",,,
,,You are on the top of this world,5,,"When Singapore flyer reaches at its highest point an announcement is heard , ""you are on the top of this world"" and that beautifully summarizes the entire experience. Cabins of Singapore flyer are air conditioned so you can spend good 30 minutes in peace and comfort gazing the spectacular buildings on one side and ships floating on calm sea on the other.

A must do activity.",,,
,,Board your Flight Now,4,,Great view from the level of 150 meters. A perfect place to unwind for each age group. Must read history of flyer.,,,
,,Impressive view,4,,"We joined about 8 others and spent the next 30 minutes doing a full revolution while at the same time getting some wonderful views of the bay, Sentosa, Sky scrapers and even Malaysia. A little costly but superbly run and managed. Worth a visit",,,
,,Birds eye view,5,,"even if you are afraid of heights you can do this, and should. The 30-45 min ride is so smooth and the vista takes your mind off the height. Great for young and old alike",,,
,,Tallest observation wheel in Asia,5,,"Singapore Flyer is the tallest observation wheel in Asia. It is one of the main tourist attractions in Singapore. We went with our family with kids and enjoyed the sky scrappers of the city.

The best time to visit the flyer is just before the sunset. Since the traveling time of one round is nearly 45 minutes, if we board the wheel just before the sunset, we will definitely enjoy both the day and night views of Singapore in a single round.

Another beauty of the wheel is, they allow us to rent a cubicle for parties and functions",,,
,,Panoramic view of Singapore,5,,"Thought this was a little pricey but it was so worth it, not scary...you hardly feel it moving and the panoramic view of Singapore is amazing! I would recommend this.",,,
,,Can't see the whole view,4,,"I want to visited my niece and we have no place to go as this place no need to book or have show time. After we met at MRT somewhere we took a cab direct to Singapore Flyer. Inside it quite big and we are just only 2 person and have not much thing to talk and chat so we just take a photo and see the view around the city. The view just ok, some point of view we can't see from the flyer. But finally we can give answer to our friends that we arrived to Spore !",,,
,,Very nice to see the city from the top.....,4,,"During our visit to Singapore we went to Singapore Flyer, very nice experience, this attraction give you a fantastic view of the city as well of the gardens by the bay and the sea.

A must to see if you visit Singapore as well it was told is the highest in the world.
take care.Claudio",,,
,,Good views at night,4,,If you are a senior citizen you will only get the cheaper rate in the morning .we went at night and were lucky enough to see a firework display,,,
,,"Giant Wheel, not like in our amusement parks",5,,"It was built like capsules which has two doors. One to enter, rear door for exit. It has 28 capsules which will take 28 minutes to complete one rotations. All capsules are connected with security camera. I noticed one capsule which was a luxurious one, with gold plated items in it. Main thing is that, it will not stop. We have to enter and exit through the oval platform.",,,
,,"""A fantastic over view to Singapore""",5,,"We have been to Singapore Flyer at the mid day time , the view was fantastic every time we move upwards or downwards you can see a different great view to Singapore.
The experience was really great I hope I can be there again at a night Time tour.",,,
,,Great way to spend 45 minutes,4,,"We got lucky and went when there was no lines but I can imagine the place getting busy. If it is busy I'd say it probably isn't worth the wait, otherwise it's a nice way to spend a bit of time having a look at the skyline. The structure seems very solid and safe. From there its also a quick walk over the helix Bridge to Marina Bay Sands.",,,
,,Beautiful view from the top,4,,"Singapore flyer is a great attraction to be at when visiting this city, especially with family. The flyer takes about 35 min to rotate once so ample time to enjoy the view and click photos. The tickets however seems a bit expensive but you can't help it. Singapore is an expensive city and you will find everything costly here except taxi fares. The flyer has a dining option also which we didn't take due to being very expensive at about $250 for an hour.

A trivia: did you know that initially the flyer used to rotate clockwise when viewed from the river. That means the top of the flyer look like drifting from the downtown buildings. The owners put in a lot of money to change the rotation direction just to comply with Feng Shui, which suggested that the top of the flyer should go into the downtown direction and not away. This meant now the flyer rotates in anticlockwise direction when viewed from river.",,,
,,Fantastic views,4,,Great views of the city. We went at night and were able to get so terrific photos. A bit disappointed that much of the info stuff on the way in was 'under maintenance'. We got our entry for free as part of the Singapore stopover with the local airline. Well worth the time.,,,
,,worth a look.,4,,"The flyer takes around 30 minutes to do a circle.Good views all round and good photo opertunities.Entry on the first floor and a explanatory walk to the capsules.Photo taken against a green wall for superimposing and purchase later on.Of course theres the souvenir shop.This is where you view your pics.Bit expensive.......3 shots, all different, SGD45.Food avaikiable on ground level.So, its kind of compulsory to do the Flyer when in Singapore.The price on walk up entry is expensive.We purchased a 3 day pass that inckuded this so it was a lot cheaper.",,,
,,good view,4,,"great view of the seaside, skyscrapers and the racing track. Nice managed and well maintained facility. like other Singapore attractions, feel this is bit costly esp for family trip.",,,
,,"Great, relaxing way to enjoy the views of Singapore city",5,,"We spent a 8hrs in Singapore as a stop over and first stop was to visit the Singapore Flyer, when we go there (weekday about 2pm), there were no lines and we were on the flyer immediately. As it wasnt busy we had the capsule to ourselves. A lovely 360 view of the city. We watched a storm roll in also, which translated to amazing photos. A worthwhile visit. Approx 30min ride. Easy to get to from Changi Airport via MRT.",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"Some great views of Singapore. Would recommend this attraction for all ages. The pods are spacious,and clean. Good value for money and is very well organised .",,,
,,Views you have to see to believe,4,,"Another part of our Singapore at night excursion. This giant Ferris Wheel is 150 meters in diameter (about 460 feet) and the top is 165 meters above ground. Each compartment holds about 12 people seated on benches, but can easily handle another dozen standing. 12 people is enough for everyone to get up and get around to see all angles of the city from 500 feet in the air. While we were there, we were treated to an extra that you cannot ask for. The Chinese New Year is coming up in a few days and the costumes performers were practicing in full costume on the Formula One race track that was directly below us. Wonderful way to see the city from the top side. One complete revolution takes about 25-30 minutes and well worth the time and money.",,,
,,Fun ride,4,,A good way to see Singapore on the Flyer and plenty of restaurants to eat from. The gardens and games are relaxing . A good spot for picnic and fun outing for family,,,
,,"nice views, specially in the night",4,,"far from the center (20 minute walk) but nice views which make going there really worth, avoid high season; better views in the night tan during the day",,,
,,Great views,5,,Similar to the London Eye - but maybe bigger - a great way to spend half an hour as the wheel slowly circulates to take you way above most of Singapore. The entrance has places to eat and drink so you could make a night of it. Did it during the day would like to have done it at night.,,,
,,fantastic and very good value,5,,"We were on a stopover in Singapore and found this was a fab day out.We caught the underground train and you get off at Marins bay.

The views from the flyer are amazing.Reduced rates for the over 60's which made this excellent value.well worth a visit.",,,
,,awesome in Singapore flyer,5,,"To take about 30mins to spin one round is worth to pay. You can observe all the view of marina bay, especially for night view. Just few tourist to visit is that I have never imagined, so NO loud sound & noisy....you can focus and concentrate to take photo for those nice view!",,,
,,Just amazing at night,5,,"I went there in August 2014 and I had an amazing experiences with my friends. The view from the top is just stunning and top let you down. Even the ride is a bit short for only 30mns and with the cost of around 33 SGD, it is worth not to miss it when you are in Singapore. Before the getting into the capsule, you have a chance to take souvenir photos but quite expensive. I did that tough and bring it back home. It's a must see thing I would say.",,,
,,Beautiful view,5,,A great way to see the awesome surrounds of Singapore. Really enjoyed this with the family. You are able to get fantastic pictures. What a gorgeous city it is with so many different building designs. We went during the day. You can have dinner or afternoon tea on there.,,,
,,Romantic night,3,,"Definitely an attraction for the romantic couples out there, and even better if you're there on a quiet night and score your own capsule without paying the huge price tag that you would normally need to! Unfortunately we were not lucky like the couple before us and we had to share our capsule with a few others.

The view going up and down is amazing, with full 360 degree views of the city. The whole experience takes around half an hour.",,,
,,Amazing view over Singapore city,5,,You will get amazing view of Singapore city. Flyer moves at a very slow pace so everybody in the cabin will have enough time to make amazing photos. We took the ride at 11am and had a clear view.,,,
,,Great way to see Singapore from the sky,4,,"We took the Singapore Flyer early in the morning to see the skyline.

Great views, good angles, friendly staff, fantastic information on the build and a really fun experience. Can imagine that a ride in the evening would provide even more exciting views.

Would have liked if there was some (occasional) commentary about points of interest in Singapore as they came into view.",,,
,,Lovely Experience!,4,,"I am usually uncomfortable with heights but the capsule is well built and gives a safe vibe and i found myself quite comfortable during the ride. The views were amazing, and the ride lasted for about 30 mins though it actually felt a bit short. This is a must try experience in my opinion.",,,
,,Bird's eye view of the Singapore skyline.,5,,"For little expense one can have a fabulous time looking over the Singapore skyline as the Ferris wheel inches it's way up and round. Strategically placed in the Marina area, one can see the flotilla of tankers etc awaiting their turn to disgorge their cargo, the tall skyscrapers in the CBD area, the hotel with a boat-styled roof, the colonial buildings and the modern apartments further afield for its citizens.",,,
,,Best view in Singapore,5,,"Don't miss out on this, the views are awesome and there is a great little hawker centre right there, try the satays. Singapore has so much to offer but this was a highlight for my wife who is scared of heights and she loved it.",,,
,,Fantastic view,5,,"While recognising this attraction is probably a cliche, we couldn't resist the pull of the flyer. What I did not realise was that the hub of the Flyer is a very busy commercial area, with restaurants and other shops operating from the same geographical location.

An entire circuit takes around 20 minutes in total, and in that time, you will be trapped in a glass enclosure with other people you are grouped with. So obviously, your experience will be dependent on a bunch of strangers. Luckily, our experience was a good one, with people shifting often, and not getting too boisterous. Each 'car' is very large, and you can sit and enjoy the view, or get up and stand next to a window. The design is pure genius, as you are able to get a good vantage point no matter where you are situated in the car.

Despite having visited Singapore numerous times, being in the Flyer showed me some new areas, and some new buildings. While I would find it tough to recommend to someone who wasn't initially keen on doing it, if you are already thinking about doing the Flyer, I think it is well worth the cost.",,,
,,Wheel of fortune!,4,,"If you are not afraid from the height then it is nice, but remember that it is made from glass, so you can see everything, everywhere. Wheel takes a round trip and that's it! The view appears fine, but on my opinion the view from the Marina bay sands hotel Observation deck is much better! (cheaper as well) I have visited both places, so that is my conclusion after all.",,,
,,Excellent,4,,"A superb way of fully appreciating the Singapore skyline,higher than the London eye ,as you enter the reception area you are presented with a very informative presentation of the construction of the Singapore flyer WORTH A VISIT",,,
,,Stunning views over Singapore,5,,"We visited on a weekday afternoon - straight on and a great experience. If you are on a stop-over with Singapore Airlines you can show boarding pass and obtain discount on tickets. Great views of F1 track, marina, city - useful to plan next step of visit and a lovely way to see the city. We had lunch at the venue - to the rear are many small vendors selling authentic, reasonably priced food.",,,
,,View of the Bay,5,,"A wonderful way to have a birds eye view of downtown Singapore and the surrounding harbour area and out to sea, 30 minutes of a quiet, relaxing time",,,
,,Must See in Singapore,5,,Singapore flyer has to be on your list of to dos while in the city. The flyer gives you great views of the city for 30 minutes or so. Recommend timing your visit so that you get into the capsule around dusk time so that you get both day time and night time views of the city.,,,
,,explore the height of singapore,4,,"It's amazing to see the city from a height. Buildings, skyscrapers, sea, ships and neighboring countries Indonesia can be seen very clearly.
Our children were very enthusiastic. At first they were a little frightened, but they are slowly getting used to it and try to enjoy the beautiful scenery around them.",,,
,,Amaizing view,5,,If you want to see how beautiful Singapore is u gotta come here. U will have a 360潞 view of Singapore in a very slow moving flyer. Highly recommended.,,,
,,Excellent!,5,,Well worth a visit and good value for money! Don't worry about queues mid week! We went on a Monday morning and only one other person in our pod ! No queues! A totally enjoyable experience and great view of the Grand Prix track! Wanted to go back on and hate heights!!!,,,
,,"good, but....",4,,"I went on here this afternoon and although the views were breathtaking, there was no commentary or any way of knowing what you were looking at. If this was included this would have been spectacular",,,
,,On top of Singapore,5,,My First visit abroad was very satisfying...especially after got on to Singapore Flyer...felt like really on top of world....very impressive ride on Singapore Flyer for 30 minutes cant simply put in words..one has to really ride on to experience. View of Marina Bay from Singapore flyer is simply magnificient.,,,
,,Not so great,4,,"This is just an observation wheel that USED to be the world's largest. It has a spectacular view of fantastic Singapore but other than that, it's boring. There's not much to do once you're on the ground so it's better to go to somewhere else immediately after the 45 minutes in the air.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"The view was beautiful. It would be nice if it went for a little bit longer than half an hour. You can get cocktail packages on it if you want but you are not allowed to take your own food and drinks. I believe it is worth it for the view,",,,
,,Easy way to see Singapore,5,,Must add in your sightseen beautiful view from flyer better to buy all sightseen pass from here if you forget to buy online deal you can buy a single ticket from here for all attraction & save money,,,
,,View at all angles,4,,"Experienced the ride at sunset and thrilled to do it that time.

It seems that it is not as popular as the other attractions in Singapore as there was only us a a few groups of folks lining up to take the capsules of the the flyer.

The ride is around 30minutes long. It really offers the best birds-eye views Singapore has offer, and we took as many photos our cameras can store. Thank God for digital photos!

Will we be back? I guess....",,,
,,Great views around the city,4,,The views of Singapore are excellent this attraction is a must do if you are only in Singapore a short time.,,,
,,Great fun,5,,"Realy enjoyed the experience, picked up the ticket ,no problem. Lovely air con compartments and not crowded.",,,
,,Good views,4,,If you have 2 hours to see Singapore- just head here. You can get a glimpse of the whole city- at least all its notable landmarks. Also quick connect to and fro the airport. That is btw the time we had,,,
,,A must do in Singapore!,5,,This attraction is a must to do while visiting Singapore. Taking the journey gives you a full view of the city 165m above. You don't even feel that the capsule is moving at all. It's about a 40-45 minute ride and stops halfway to give you the time to take in all the views. Great attraction!,,,
,,Great view of the city,4,,"The Singapore flyer is a must do attraction in Singapore. Particularly at night when you can see the Singapore skyline light up. Great views of both the city and the Marina bay sands buildings.
I would highly recommend despite the pricey tickets.
The cheap ice-cream on the ground level provided by the ticket is a bonus. Particularly if you decide to go during the day!",,,
,,Nice view of Singapore city,4,,"It was one of the tallest wheel in the world, it offer 30 degree scenic view of the skyscraper of Singapore. Total I have visited 3 times and every time is a different experience for me as I went on a different timing, which is during the afternoon, evening and night. I love the scenic view especially at night, it was just so romantic and during the night it is less crowded, best if you come as a couple during the night, it will just take your breath away and both of you will just indulge in this super romantic atmosphere. Highly recommended but of cos the ticket price is quite expensive as it only offer a 30 mins ride.",,,
,,Worth the cost!,5,,"The ride is a bit expensive, but it's definitely worth the price on a clear day. You get spectacular views of the city - and if you're lucky (like we were), you may get a whole car to yourself for the 30 minute ride.",,,
,,Wonderful Experience,5,,"We visited Singapore flyer in November 2013. It was great experience throughout, the view from the top is just amazing. We can pretty much see the whole city from the flyer. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Singapore. The cabins are nice and spacious and the staff is very friendly. They provide you with a map of all the points of interest which can be easily located from the flyer.",,,
,,Expensive but nice,4,,"Nice view and very fast line. We did not wait too long to be able to ride the flyer. Each car is big enough to walk around and take photos. The design also makes you feel safe even if you are already high up.

Only complain is that the cost is very expensive especially if you are going as a couple.",,,
,,Great experience!,5,,The Singapore Flyer experience is absolutely amazing. It takes 30 min to complete a round. The view from inside the capsule is stunning with 360 degrees view of Singapore skyline. Post the ride we walked up to the Marina Bay Sands hotel on the helix bridge which takes appr 15 min. We went there at 5 pm on a weekday and there was no waiting at all.,,,
,,OMG !!,5,,"This is an absolutely must visit attraction.
In the past I have been seriously impressed by the London Eye. The Singapore Flyer is 35 metres higher. That might not seem a lot but 30 metres is 100 feet.
The views of the Marina Bay and city beyond are breathtaking.
Highly, highly recommended.",,,
,,The view from the top,5,,"Singapore Flyer gives an amazing view of the city from the top! Especially if you head in by the evening, when the lights come up, the view is absolutely stunning!",,,
,,Worth Visiting for picturesque view of Singapore,5,,"Nice view of Singapore, especially, Marina Bay Sands, Gardens By the Bay, and various other corporate multi-storied buildings...",,,
,,Peaceful 30 minutes up in the air!,4,,Brilliant! It was fun seeing the city from atop and the children were happy to try and locate places of tourist interest. Not too much rush. The entire process was smooth. Got an entire cabin to ourselves. No complaints about the Flyer!,,,
,,Great views,5,,We booked a private capsule with drinks and it was really a treat. Great views at night and good drinks.,,,
,,Spectacular Views,5,,"This is well worth a visit, just like the London Eye but obviously views of Singapore!! Nice garden to walk around underneath. Then take a walk on the F1 track if your a fan. Also underneath. One of my husbands highlights!",,,
,,Loved It,5,,Offers a bird eye view. We could visit there in MoTook many pictures. Couldnt resist to buy Souvenir. Subway Indian restaurants available at the ground floor. Enjoyed our meals.,,,
,,A must do while in Singapore,4,,A fantastic view of the city especially at night. Although it's not cheap at $33 SGD each it is still worth doing I believe as the city is so wonderful to see at night.,,,
,,amazing!!,5,,"A great view of the city and beyond! don't miss this attraction. absolutely gorgeousness at night! Singapore had changed so much in 10 yrs, since I had last travelled there. This was a great way to take in the many changes. surrounded by glass you have a 360 view in your cabin. The revolution is very slow, so none of us suffered any queasiness. We travelled with family but this would also be lovely for couples or solo.",,,
,,Do the Moet Flight!,4,,"We booked the Moet Flight at 9pm Friday night. The Moet Flight gives you champagne in a special car with express entry. Ok, the view is no different, but the extra attention, champagne and special car made it even more fun. Incredible views no matter where you stand!",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Great Experience. Located in a wonderful place near esplanade and Promenade. a must vis place and one gets a wonderful view of the Singapore city completely. Lot of exciting things at the base of the flyer and nice place to spend the evening with family and friends.,,,
,,Extremely good,5,,"This was my husband's first experience on a wheel as he would not go on the London Eye. He has now had a wonderful experience as you can see the water, the city and other places of interest from a great viewing platform! I would recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore. We found everything we did in Singapore to be of good value for money",,,
,,Crazy fun!,5,,"The view was beautiful. Took a lot of pictures. I am afraid of heights but I enjoyed the whole ride. Even though there were others who were slightly noisy, I still enjoyed the serene view of the city.",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,We were on the flyer for a night view of beautiful Singapore. The ride was incredibly smooth - no rocking at all and a views were beautiful. Highly recommend.,,,
,,A great experience,5,,"During a short stay in Singapore I was advised to try this out. It provided excellent views over the city and I took photographs which were nice. It was quiet on this occasion and I enjoyed conversation with some other visitors.

Getting there was quite easy although it did require going up stairs and it wasn't immediately obvious where one was to go - but it did not take long before a welcoming young woman invited me in.

Try it. You won't regret it.",,,
,,AMAZING EXPERIENCE,5,,"a must see.. Approx 30min ride but it is all value for money, You can see various views of the beautiful city. Capsules are beautifully designed and you can get Amazing Pictures.",,,
,,Sensational!,5,,"Been on The London Eye, but this was totally the best experience. You barely know you are moving, the engineering left my husband breathless and the views were really and truly out of this world..... can highly recommend....",,,
,,So organised! A whole experience,4,,No pushing or overcrowding and perfect views of every corner of the city It's the largest of its kind in the world,,,
,,Super!!!!!,5,,"Well worth the ticket price around 拢17 (GBP) A my lord it's high !!! Ride last around 30 mins, try to go at sunset for stunning views of singapore skyline",,,
,,Very good view of the Singapore skyline.,4,,It is like any other flyer. Gives you a good view of the Singapore skyline at night. Can get busy at times.,,,
,,One of the giant Flyers in the world,5,,"Near Promenade MRT,Flyer gives spectacular views of city attractions ,including Marina bay sands hotel,Flower domes,Esplanade theaters busy highway below and singapore river etc. etc.Takes about an hour and half including rain forest and Journey of dreams show.Good air conditioning in the capsule and good view to all inmates.",,,
,,Worth doing as the views are fantastic.,5,,"Worth the money to see the Singapore skyline,plenty of food outlets in the complex and the main drop off for the hop on hop off buses.Taxis always available.",,,
,,Flyer Experince,5,,"A great way to see Singapore. For those who want to spend some money, a great place to have your dinner.",,,
,,Exceptional views,4,,Great views during the daytime! Ticket reasonablely priced! Very nice views! Loves the views to singapore and i reccomend to visit!,,,
,,amazing,5,,"we were lucky to fly above earth on a sunny day, on a sunny sun shine. One word to describe, amazing.",,,
,,beautiful view at night,5,,queue was quite long.. but the queue was moving fast. it has an amazing view at night especially the the skylight. worth the money :),,,
,,Great Experience,5,,"Went to Flyer with Family and Friends had a great time well organized clean neat and a suggestion the mornings are less crowded.

We can see the Singapore and border of Singapore and parts of Indonesian border at a distance the ride less than an hour but enjoyable kids were very exited. Flyer is a place you cannot miss if you go to Singapore.",,,
,,Nothing much here,1,,"Don鈥檛 waste your time to go to the Singapore flyer, its closed. You can see Marina bay which is very near to Singapore flyer, as a tourist you have a lot of connections to other tourist places from Singapore flyer.",,,
,,Good view,4,,"Went during the a clear sunny day, this offers great views of the city, ocean, gardens by the bay, park hotel and art science museum! I really enjoyed reading all the information given about how it was constructed on our way to the enterance gate. I think maybe more information on what you can see on your ride would make it more interesting :)",,,
,,great at sunset,5,,"we did this by chance at 7pm 29th January and it was a perfect time to see the skyline with the colours changing so dramatically through the ride, it really was a marvellous experience.
everyone was taking lots of photos as each time you moved around the pod and took in another side the sky had changed making it a lot more interesting than i think pure day light would have been, obviously the sunset is different throughout the year but well worthing going at sunset.",,,
,,A bit over- hyped,3,,"Plus point - you get to see a birds eye view of entire Singapore city from different levels.
Minus point - it's way too slow and you don't get the feel of movement. Would have liked it better if it moved a little faster. The capsule can take around 14 people at one time - would have preferred it to be smaller. Nothing great as such.",,,
,,On board Singapore Flyer,4,,"My fourth time on board Singapore Flyer. I visited twice in the day and twice at night.

Singapore Flyer presents a moving experience at every turn with amazing 360-degree panoramic sights of Singapore. It offers an extraordinary views of the beautiful city. A complete rotation of the wheel takes approximately 30 minutes.

weekend is always packed with people where they placed 28 people to a capsule. I preferred to go during weekdays where there are only 6 people in a capsule. More privacy

,,Don't miss Singapore Flyer,5,,Splendid adventure .. We had taken the flyer on the day time and had a beautiful view of singapore..Had a lovely 20 minutes ride with family,,,
,,Amazing experience at night,5,,It is the iconic place not to miss while you are in Singapore. It is best at night time since you can see the aerial view of Singapore from the top and it looks amazing.,,,
,,Worth a trip,4,,Singpore Flyer - expensive for what it is but on a good day (or night) the views are stunning. Overall it's worth it. For the Senior Citizens - don't forget to ask foe the Senior Discount. It makes a difference!,,,
,,"amazing view,",4,,"a must visit, the view is breathtaking and one can literally see the city in its splendour. the ships moving across the bay are an added bonus.",,,
,,Stunning,5,,We did this on the evening and the views of Singapore and the lights were brilliant. Well worth the ticket price and gives you an appreciation of the scale of the place.,,,
,,Superb views over the bay and great city views.,5,,Well worth the price and the trip. Great views from the compartments which are air conditioned and airy. Not so good for anyone with vertigo!,,,
,,My First Attraction in Singapore,3,,This was my first visit to any attraction in Singapore. I went with my family and had a good time over there. For one complete round it took 30 minutes. We saw the great view of Singapore city skyline and the coastal view. It is a nice place to visit as you can see the beautiful singapore city skyline from the top of the wheel.,,,
,,One time watch,4,,Probably The biggest flyer in the word....but very expensive...SGD 33 for one ride.....the flyer is very slow though....it takes one half an hour ride to complete an ride...you can see almost the entire Singapore from up above.,,,
,,A great view.,4,,"The view over singapore is outstanding. Unfortunately it rained the time we were on it, and it can be a bit expensive. Probably best at night as singapore is just incredible after dark",,,
,,one simply cant miss this ride...,5,,The Flyer is a must visit for anyone and everyone..though personally i would love to go in the evening when the flyer is all lit up..its a 1/2 hr ride giving an amazing view of Singapore..my son was thrilled to be on the flyer..a place u just cant miss...,,,
,,Its good... but very fast and not satisfying for the pay..,3,,We had booked a Moet and Chandon ride and fortunately we got the whole capsule to ourselves... the view was amazing but it was raining a bit on that day so couldn't enjoy it to the fullest... and the ride also felt a bit fast as the time got over very soon... Overall its a bit pricey for the ride... quality and service was good...,,,
,,Into the clouds,5,,"I visited the Singapore flyer after the London eye. I thought as it is similar there might be no difference at all. However, I was wrong. As it is the tallest giant wheel in the world, the view from the top is just spectacular. The skyline of Singapore is just beautiful from the top and the 30 minutes goes by very fast. I definitely recommend going for this.",,,
,,Must visit !!,5,,"If you want a aerial view of the city - head to flyer. The view from the top is specially beautiful. The entire round takes 30 minutes so plenty of time for clicking nice pics too !!

Book online for discount otherwise getting tickets at the counter is convenient too. Flyer visit can be clubbed with Marina Bay Sands & Gardens by the Bay.",,,
,,More than just a ferris wheel,5,,"We don't usually spend this much on a tourist attraction, but we are so glad we did. The interactive displays are very informative and interesting. The views over Singapore are lovely. There is a great selection of hawker fare at the bottom too. Highly recommended",,,
,,Pricey,3,,"Singapore Flyer located at Promenade....can be easily reached thru MRT
It take abt 30 minutes for the ferris wheel to spin and cn clearly see the view of Singapore
From here...u cn c the Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay and etc
Advise to come here on night while cn c the nightview of the Singapore
However the price is a bit pricey...for SGD33....I cn do a lot of other things in Singapore",,,
,,Great views but skip the Sky Dining,3,,"We took both a day and night flight on the Singapore Flyer.
The day flight offered up fabulous views of the city and was a smooth ride. The hour went surprisingly quickly and I'd say it is just as good as The London Eye (with different views of course!).
The night trip involved Sky Dining - where we were served a four course meal of terrible, and I mean terrible food. There were also limited drink options. There were six couples in the cabin, and we got stuck in the middle so no great views because we weren't pushy enough to run to an outer table. For the $150 we paid each for the experience I was very under whelmed with the food, view and service.
Great for a circuit but skip the $150 sky dining.",,,
,,A brother of london eye from another mother,5,,"The Singapore Flyer presents the city in a totally different light. We were awestruck to see the Marina Sands Bay from such a height. We have also been to London Eye and the experience was in fact a tad better in Singapore. It is costly if tickets are bought at the counter. However, get 3 days Singapore Pass and you'll get free entry.",,,
,,Classic,5,,"I had heard a lot about the flyer and the experience was literally breath taking. At a very nominal fees you can spend about 30mins hanging in the air and experiencing gravity. It is once in a lifetime experience, must try",,,
,,Stop over,5,,Well worth ride. Views magnificent Recommend to all even stopped wheel to allow wheel chair on. Good for photos.,,,
,,Flying high,4,,"Our teens got the chance to go the Flyer and their score were thumps up. It took them more than 1/2 an hour from when first handed over the ticket to finally come out of the pod including waiting time. The actual 'fly' time would be a bit shorter. But they enjoyed it.
The complex is quite large with multilevels offering a variety of shops ranging from souvenirs, restaurants, to fish massaging and even a hawker style eatery at the basement.
It is also a tourist drop off and pick up point for charters and other tour operators such as the 'Duck tour'.
Our teens tried the fish messaging and felt very tickled, highly interesting. The shop here seemed nicer and cleaner than those in Chinatown.
We didn't try the hawker center there but tried the ice cream kiosk outside and felt disappointed. It was not up to the ice cream from Glenelg (SA) and dearer too.
The center of the basement is lust, green, well designed garden with fish pond, bridge and walkway snaking through. You would lost for time being in there, even it's not very big
We bough our tickets for the Flyer at the 'Sea Wheel travel' in Chinatown at a discount rate, thank you Tripadvisor Forum.",,,
,,Great way to see the city,5,,"On our first day in Singapore, we started walking and ended up near the Singapore Flyer. We hadn't intended on going on it, but we were close so decided to check it out. There was no wait and our family of 4 got a pod to ourselves. It was a great way to see the city.",,,
,,A Must do for any Tourist,5,,"This is a must do for anyone visiting Singapore, both my husband and l arent the best at heights but this was absolutely fantastic, the views were great, we didnt even feel the capsule moving around the wheel. The capsule is steady enough that you can go to town with your camera. It was air conditioned which was a welcome relief in the heat and humidity of September.",,,
,,Don't miss this!!!!,5,,"Due to time restrictions went during the day.
Wonderful far reaching views over the city/bay and beyond. Will be going again but at night for the lights across the Bay of Gardens and city.
As this was a stop-over with Singapore International Airlines we got free access to this.
I would highly recommend anyone stopping over in Singapore to a) fly with the airline as they are exceptional b) discounts available whilst in Singapore are excellent ( we saved over $200 on sightseeing in less than 48hrs ).",,,
,,Pay for a little extra,5,,"We decided to go on the flyer last minute and booked our tickets at 6pm and had to be there for 8.
We chose to go for the ticket with Champagne, it cost 拢10 extra each but was worth it!
We arrived at the ticket office and got escorted to a private bar. We were then escorted to the pods on the flyer (passed everyone queueing) and as we were the only people with champagne tickets at that time we had the whole pod to ourselves!
Great trip and well worth the extra money as it meant no queueing.",,,
,,Go for a spin,5,,It takes 30 minutes to complete the loop. Great views as you ascend and decend - from the city skyline to the ships lining the bay.,,,
,,A must for any visitors,4,,Thought this was great - a birds eye view of the city. View all around Singapore. Will go back for a night time view too.,,,
,,Looks more beautiful from the outside,4,,"Its my forth year in Singapore so I have seen the iconic flyer from all angles and it looks more beautiful from all of them as compared to the inside.

Like everybody I also wanted to experience the round ride but it is a little disappointing. Three main reasons:

Very very slow.
Position is not so good, view is not great.
Cabins are not that good the screen is not clear so no luck with pictures.",,,
,,"Great view, kinda slow",4,,"I went as part of a tour. I really liked the extra stuff before you get on the flyer, little bits of facts and experiments for kids to do. They flyer experience itself was very exciting...at first. About 10 minutes into it you're just like...'I'm done'....while it was neat and massive I probably don't need to do it ever again. Unless I have kids and take them to Singapore. Then they are going on that flyer.",,,
,,Amazing Fun,5,,I cannot recommend this highly enough. The wheel rotates very slowly so it is definitely not a midway type rude. The cars are huge and can probably hold twenty people. The views of Singapore are unparalleled. Do it !!,,,
,,Touristy but nice,3,,Tickets were included in Singapore stop over program - we were surprised how much fun it was - nice view of the city!,,,
,,Nice ride,3,,"The cars were great and when we went in the afternoon, there were very few people around. It takes about 30 minutes and costs $33, unless you have one of many 10% coupons that are floating around. The view from the top is great. After the ride we walked over to the Sands hotel/casino next door and found that for the same price we could have take the elevator to the ""ship"" that sits on top. It's about the same height as the Flyer.",,,
,,Great View,5,,"Well worth the ride, gives a great view of the city and the surrounding areas. Travels very slow so easy to take everything in.",,,
,,Night lights,4,,Great sights of Singapore at night as it seems every where's lit up its a beautiful city in the day time at night it's spectacular,,,
,,Must do in Singapore,4,,"We went around sunset as we heard that was the nicest time to visit. Possibly a bit later is also better as soon as the skyscrapers are lighting up, will make wonderful pictures of the singapore skyline. A Must visit to see the stunning views from top",,,
,,Great Views,4,,This is the Singapore version of the London Eye. We went about 5.00pm and paid our money (good discount for 60+ if you buy at the ticket office rather than off site) and walked straight on with no queuing,,,
,,a must go..,4,,one of the highest flyer of the world..its slow and take full round in half n hour....you will get a full view of the city..,,,
,,Worth it,4,,"I was a bit sceptical about going on the flyer - we had just spent a week in Singapore and was getting a bit tired of always reaching into our pockets, but I was pleasantly surprised by the flyer. We had intended to go at sunset (only about 8 mins long in Singapore) but didn't actually get there until it was fully dark (and not at all busy!) If you have never been on this type of wheel (we hadn't) it really is a unique perspecitive - the ride up looking at the vast engineering feat is really interesting and then reaching the top does feel like you are on top of the world ""with no hands"".
A family pass cost $100, but we all loved it.",,,
,,Expensive.,5,,"The same as the London one,you do get a good view of the island on a clear day,it takes about an hour to go round.
You get the tour buses there,which are worth going on.
You can walk round the F1 track as it goes round the wheel,",,,
,,What a view!,5,,"We waited for 2 minutes only to board our cabin, it was 7.30pm, perfect!! The views were magnificent and we were able to see the light show at Gardens by the Bay from the air.",,,
,,Flyer,3,,Nice view from the top. View all around Singapore. We went up for the kids and they love the view. Not sure if it's for everyone cause of the price.,,,
,,Best view of the city,5,,"The number 28 is very important for the flyer.For eg. 28 cabins, 28 mins per ride, 28 rides per day etc.Putting that aside, it offers an excellent view of the city and frankly its worth seeing this magnificent city in all its glory.The flyer is very well managed with polite staff,spotless cabins and Wifi too!",,,
,,Take a Flight!,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is the largest Ferris wheel in the world at 541 feet/165 metres. It is a fun way to see a panoramic view of Singapore and the ship filled ocean. The ""flight"" takes 30 minutes. Daily flights are from 8.30am 鈥?10.30pm.

(January 2015) Adult ticket is S$33.00, Children 3-12: S$21.00 and Seniors 60+: S$24.00. It is worth the price.",,,
,,A relaxing ride,5,,"Unless you suffer from claustrophobia or fear of heights, this is a good way to relax while drinking in the views of Singapore. You can do it twice: daylight and night time, as it's a different experience. Add glamour by taking the champagne carriage.",,,
,,Only Fair...,3,,"My partner and I did not find this to be a highlight of our recent visit to Singapore. Perhaps this was because we shared our capsule with a large noisy and unruly family group of four children and four adults. The children ran and pushed their way past us on the escalator to the ride and then proceeded to yell at each other throughout the ride and constantly push in front of us to take photos. The adults in the group did not reprimand them but yelled at each other! The views are incredible but you can get great views from the bar at the top of Marina Bay Sands and enjoy a nice drink in peace and quiet! Perhaps our experience was tainted by our fellow travellers but having ""done"" the Flyer once, I wouldn't bother to do it again.",,,
,,39 minutes of the same view,2,,"Maybe I'm being a bit harsh. It is a 360 degree view. You do see the gorgeous harbour and Gardens by the Bay. If you ate staying in a hotel with a harbour view it probably isn't worth it.

It moves very slowly and you are in a sealed glass and steel box do it doesn't even have that open air thrill of a normal Ferris wheel.

Ok but I'd rather spend $30 on something else.

Btw, we did buy a multipass Iventure card. It was great ! Avoided queues everywhere and much cheaper. You can buy before you arrive in Singapore or just go to Somerset mall and get one there at the info counter.",,,
,,Wonderful way to see more of Singapore,5,,"We decided to go on the Singapore Flyer on a recent visit to the Garden City. Having already been to the London Eye a few times and the Melbourne Wheel, we have to admit this was the best ride of them all. What's so amazing about the Flyer? First of all, you are given the freedom to turn up for the flight that you'd like to be on. You don't need to decide on the time when you buy the tickets online. Once you have your tickets purchased for the day of the visit, you are all set. We tried to time it for the sunset flight so we could see a bit of the city bathed in sunlight and also at dusk. However, we were a little too early and saw just the daylight version. The Flyer is so stable and steady, you won't even notice it was moving. Even my dad who has trouble steadying himself, found the experience unbelievable. It is easy to get to the Flyer and service was prompt and friendly. Do get a picture souvenir of yourself in the Flyer (at the end of the flight, in the shop). They take pictures of you as you are coming in and you really should go a bit crazy with your funny expressions and arms because the OTT pose just looks so much better when they superimpose your shot onto the Flyer shot. The Flyer is a highly recommended visit when in Singapore.",,,
,,fantastic view,5,,"this was very good, don't bother trying to buy multi pass/attraction tickets, they are costly with many restrictions and catches, we just payed the attraction direct. Good value and cheaper than going up to the top of Marina Bay Sands.",,,
,,Incredible View,5,,"This is a great way to see Singapore from the air, the view from the top is brilliant and on a clear day you can see all the way across the Straights. A circuit takes 1/2 an hour and you only realise you are moving from the slow changing scenery. The large cars offer bench seating and for the more adventurous you can even have diner although a bit pricey and you do 2 circuits so eat fast. they also offer a wedding package which sounds good value and certainly a different way to hold a small intimate ceremony with incredible views. A must for any visitor to Singapore",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,Very reasonably priced and when we went at 4pm quiet... we had a capsule to ourselves. Well worth doing.,,,
,,Quite nice. Beautiful view,4,,"Very comfortable ride, great views over singapore. Brings you almost inline with marina bay sands skydeck-went during the day. Being the middle of the day on a Wednesday we had no queues and shared the capsule with 4 others. Would recommend.",,,
,,A Heaven Down Here,5,,"There's only one word that came into my mouth when I went there...""Wow!"" It was an awesome trip with my family, our first out of the country vacation actually celebratin my mom's birthday. We went at the Singapore Flyer, 3rd day of our vacation and it was Fascinating! The view from up there was breath-taking (if you're afraid of heights, you will forget you're like 3, 000ft above because of the beautiful scenery that Singapore Flyer captures, I promise that!) I will definitely visit Singapore Flyer when I get back there, this year!",,,
,,Worth one round,4,,Look beautiful from far away but fearful to travel in the flyer until you happen to see the cabin and step in. I have fear of height but here it did not get precipitated. It takes almost an hour for the whole circle. You get a great view of the city. Visit only once.,,,
,,NOT TO BE MISSED,5,,"sadly, we left this our our last day.. should have booked the meal or high tea option but we left it too late. This ride provides another great perspective of Singapore and lots of it's views from a different angle. Go early to avoid the crowds. Very relaxed and spacious cabins.",,,
,,Great ride,4,,My wife and I went on the Singapore Flyer and were surprised at the service we received. My wife was in a wheel chair and when I went to pay for the ride the guy that collected the admission fee told me because my wife was in a wheel chair I only had to pay the concession rate for her and as I was her carer I was allowed on for free which brought the admission fee down quite a lot. The ride was great and the view was unreal. Well worth the rider.,,,
,,Great views!,4,,"If you want to see Singapore, I recommend the Flyer. I still feel that the fare, particularly for a family of four is still quite expensive, but once you are up there, you will soon forget it. The views were breathtaking! I recommend going there just before the sunset as you will see Singapore in literally a different light.

After the ride, it was also very convenient to have a Hawker centre downstairs to taste some delicious local food.",,,
,,Good attraction with suprising additions,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is more than just a large airconditioned Ferris Wheel! We initially went to see the view and had already been up to the Marina Sands and thought the view from the top viewing deck was spectacular but I feel the view we got from the flyer was better as it was closer to the city and the cloud garden. The attraction has a huge selection of eatery's along with retail outlets, bars and spa's. Most of the On Off buses stop at this attraction and is a must if you are in Singapore. It takes approximately half an hour to go around.... plenty of time to take photos or videos of the scenery.",,,
,,Great views of Singapore City,5,,"From the flyer. We went there around 11am on a week day...no queues but by the time we left the line must be around half a km long. There are a few places you can purchase your meals from for a decent price. Also there are many water fountains to refill your drink bottles from. There are also many companies operating from this site who do night safari, city tours, duck tours and not to mention they have Lamborghinis which you can hire and drive yourself.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Would definitely recommend to a traveling family, it contains views of the entire city, better views than the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. A little pricy, however a well worth experience.",,,
,,Your trip to Singapore without a hop into the flyer is incomplete,5,,"This 30 minutes ride inside the capsule is something that will give you a great view of the Marina Bay area. Many will tell you to go during night and many at others; any time is good time for the flyer as the top view of the city is as good during the day as in the night. While the night is essentially glittery, the day will give you idea of how well the city is planned. From F1 track to the football stadium in the sea to Marina Bay sands and Garden by the Bay. You can see it all from here.

Our guide asked us to make a wish while on the top. They say your wish comes true only when made on the first time. Second attempts won't work.

There are two benches inside the flyer which is centrally air conditioned. Good for people to sit and for walking around and posing against the background of the city's top view.

The entire city is very very well planned and all systems at every tourist place are well organized. Here too you will be asked to pose against a green backdrop and the image will be made available to you for SGD 25.

30 minutes just evaporate. This is a must visit.",,,
,,Great view,5,,"we enjoyed it very much as it was obviously low season and we were only 5 people in one cabine. Nice view, airconditioned 30 minute ride.",,,
,,Best view of Singapore,5,,"First of all this is the biggest flyer in the world (London eye number 3). The trip is 30 minutes and an amazing view of Singapore specially Marina bay sands and the gardens by the bay. DO this and DONT do the Marina bay sands skydeck (not worth it at all).

You can book a lunch or dinner on one of the cabinets which is cool.
Dont miss it.",,,
,,Simply spectacular,5,,Wow what an amazing structure Great photo opportunities. The city really sparkles from above. Worth a visit.,,,
,,"For the best views in Singapore, go at sunset!",5,,"Even small children can enjoy this comfortable ride without fear. The large transparent cars hold up to 16 people and there are 2 bench seats inside, with plenty of walking space around the perimeter so you can get the pictures you want without obstruction. The views get better and better as you climb to the top for the big 360! The cars move slowly so no worries about motion sickness. Any fear of heights is abated by the mesmerizing scene that unfolds as you ascend. We were advised to go at night for the lights, but we got to see them coming on across the city and on the ships in the harbor, while enjoying the softly colored pastel sky as the sun went down. This may be the top attraction in Singapore!",,,
,,Enjoyed every minute of it....,5,,"Singapore flyer is said to be the largest of its kind outside USA. They offer quite a few packages and we decided to go for the "" Singapore flyer SLING"". And I should say it was more affordable when compared to the private cocoon :)) yet not as crowded as the regular flyer tour.
We hopped into this marvelous wheel together with another family of three and we were offered a drink. We pre booked the sling for 7.30pm, online, and the we were asked to be boarded precisely at that time. As The wheel rotated on the axial, we were blessed with this marvelous sight of Singapore at night. The day being the 31st of December, the lights and other preps to welcome the new year appeared heavenly. Tall buildings glistening with lights, harbour with dozens of lights coming from all those ships, street lights, carnival lights..Starry heaven it was, like in some wonderland mentioned in a fairy tale...such a breathtaking view of speechless glamour. The whole tour lasted roughly 30 minutes and we really didn't want to step out at the end of it.hehe
I should say, we won't hesitate to relive this amazing experience all over again.
I highly recommend this tour to all of you visiting Singapore whether you are a first timber or a frequent visitor..",,,
,,Great Views and a Fantastic Experience,4,,"Would definitely recommend to a traveling family, it contains views of the entire city, better views than the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. A little pricy, however a well worth experience.",,,
,,almost unique panorama,5,,"A wonderful overview of the city and an aerial view of the pit area of the F1 track. You also get to appreciate the view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel which is even taller.

Price reasonable - don,t forget to check if you are eligible for a concessionary fare",,,
,,Awesome...must to do!,5,,"Amazing view , went around 7.00 so saw both views, fantabulous at night! Must go and have an experience!",,,
,,Amazing views,4,,We visited the flyer during the day - 3pm. No queues just walked straight in which was great! Would also be good to go on the flyer at night time to see the city lights. Well worth a visit.,,,
,,Stunning sunset views,4,,Many large cities have similar large view wheels as this. Went early one Friday evening - the cars are fairly large and hold 12-15 folks comfortably. The cylindrical glass pods offer excellent viewing from all angles. The pods have a double seating bench in the center of the cabin. Those that prefer to sit on the 40 minute ride can do so. The wheel moves relatively slowly and smoothly - you generally load / unload with the wheel moving. Short walk from Promenade MRT stop.,,,
,,Wonderful,5,,The size of it is amazing. A marvel of engineering. Excellent views of the city and the port. Too bad you can't see the Marina Bay pool from the top. Best ride after 9 pm when it less crowded.,,,
,,A must for tourists...,4,,"....like I was. Its a nice experience. The view is spectacular and the ""flight"" is convenient. A small museum is situated in the hallways on the way to the entrance.",,,
,,singapore flyer,4,,Singapore Flyer gives you an excellent 360 degree view over Singapore and the harbour. The glass capsules have a seating capacity of about 20 and the information display gives you all the information about the attractions that you shouldnt miss out on. For those who have acrophobia you can opt for a more relaxed 5 course dinner in the capsule. Each revolution takes about 30 mins. There is also a flyer lounge for the 'frequent fliers'. The giant wheel is 165m in dia. slightly bigger than the london's eye.,,,
,,nice experience,5,,"A copy of London Eye, it is said that is bigger than that one from London. The ticket costs 33 SGD. You have an excellent view of the harbour, Marina Bay, Gardens.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Well worth a trip if in Singapore. Amazing views over all the city and harbour. No queueing or pre booking essential, just turn up and off you go. Staff are polite and helpful. Ride takes around 30 mins, make sure you have a camera with you to capture this amazing city,The area is clean and free from litter, easy to get toon public transport.",,,
,,a must see place with family or otherwise,5,,you will get to see all the skyline the green gardens marina bay sand etc etc from this flyer. it takes you to a good high. all covered and safe for kids and elderly. nice thing to see,,,
,,Pricey but very good,4,,A good way of seeing Singapore laid out underneath you. Best to go at dusk or just before sun down as the trip only lasts 30minutes and that way you can also see the city lights. It is pricey but good fun. Afterwards you can go to the Singaport Food Trail hawker centre underneath the Flyer for a great meal.,,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"The Singapore flyer is a Ferris wheel at the edge of the bay in Singapore. The structure is solid and the ride is as smooth as anything. Even in wind, you don't feel a thing. Its so secure that even if you are afraid of heights, you will love this ride. Highly enjoyable. Highly recommended. Views are amazing. Will go again...",,,
,,Gorgeous view,4,,"Went during the night, which was awesome. Everything was lit up and luckily a clear sky. I think the flyer moved way too slow though. But awesome pictures to take",,,
,,A wonderful 360 degree view of Singapore!,5,,The cabin is Spacious and Safe. You do not realise the speed at all. You can take pics from multiple sides with superb background views. 45 mins is the duration of this ride. Truly worth it!!!,,,
,,Great view of Singapore,5,,"If you on'the mind heights, this is worth the ride and the views are spectacular. Full glass view of the entire city and bay. Wonderful",,,
,,What a ripoff,3,,The cost of around $33 a person was expensive for a very boring view of the city. Take a lift to one of the buildings nearby and save a fortune.,,,
,,Can see all over Singapore,5,,On our return visit from Hong Kong we decided to go on the Singapore Flyer and loved seeing all over the city. I'd advise you to go in the evening. The city lights and the Gardens by the Bay are all lit up. Well worth the money. After our ride we had dinner at the food stalls just along for the entrance to the flyer. The food was good and cheap.,,,
,,How does the ladder move from left to right??,5,,"When you look to the inside of the wheel going up there is ladder on the left hand side of the structure. But, when you are coming down the ladder is on the right hand side as you look into the wheel!!!

Great attraction with great views over the city and the top deck of MBS. We did the Moet upgrade whilst it appears a bit expensive remember that wine is very expensive anywhere in Singapore.",,,
,,Pricey for so-so views,3,,"We went on the Singapore Flyer at night - and must say that the views were so-so (definitely better places to go for bird's eye views of the Singaporean skyline), although may be the light pollution made it worse for us. Tickets are quite pricey as well (30+ SGD!!!) for what I would say was a fairly short ride. Wouldn't put it on a Singaporean bucket list, but I must say it's a tourist magnet (or tourist trap, whatever you like to call it鈥?",,,
,,High in the sky,4,,"Before boarding, to me, it seemed to be just any other ride. But, the spectacular view provided from the Flyer cabin was great. The cabins are very spacious and was not crowded. The kids had more fun as they could see long long places when it went up and were enjoying every moment of it.
Overall a must place to go if in Singapore.",,,
,,Awesome,4,,"Wasn't sure about this to start with then, wow, was really pleased that we spent the time to go on this. It was really very good. Great views.",,,
,,"Decent Views, but No ""Wow"" Factor",3,,"Since we had nice views from our stay at the Conrad Centennial Hilton, this ride did not impress my son much. Maybe it would have been better at night, but for the price ($24 for an adult and $15 for my ten year old), it was expensive. Within 15 minutes of the 30 minute ride, he was bored. I guess just saying that he rode the world鈥檚 largest observation wheel (outside United States) should be enough to try it once.",,,
,,Fun at the flyer,5,,You have to do this one. Best view over singapore. $33 per person for normal 1 rotation. We booked other trips to do and so got our flyer ticket cheaper. Easy to access and well organised. No waiting.,,,
,,Super views over Marina Bay,4,,"Super views over the bay, we booked a signature cocktail flight, and got the timing just right to watch the sunset over the city. A wonderful memory!",,,
,,Quick view of Singapore,5,,"You should visit the Flyer as soon as you get to Singapore. Gives you an excellent overview of the city and its landmarks.
Takes bout 40 minutes and costs about $30.
Views over the city and Marina Bay are amazing.
Definitely a must do.
Everything in Singapore is accessible and clean!",,,
,,360 degree view of Singapore,4,,"Highly recommend you include the Singapore Flyer on your trip must dos. Amazing 360 deg views on a clear day are worth it. It will also help you orientate to Singapore City for above. Definitely must do. Panoramic views of the city

Tip - selfie stick, good camera , extra battery and Sd card. If you are using a smartphone make sure you have power bank .",,,
,,Great in nice weather,4,,"We brought our ticket and then we were able to go up at any time that afternoon night we went up just before sunset and this was a great time to go not to busy and you could still see everything. we were lucky we had great clear weather lucky we went when we did because it rained for 3 afternoons/nights in a row which meant the Singapore flyer did not operate so if you had pre-booked your tickets you didn't get a refund. so my tip: don't buy a ticket unless you are going on the flyer that day and preferable around that time as you could buy it in the morning and plan on going that night and it rains as the weather changes very quickly in Singapore so they you miss out and waste $33. So definitely pick your day and time, Singapore is big on no refunds if it rains this is on just about everything",,,
,,Fabulous Singapore view.,4,,"The Singapore Flyer gives you an excellent 360 degree view over Singapore and the harbour. On a clear day you can see over to Malaysia. The glass capsules are the most ""solid"" Ferris Wheel constructions that I have been in. They rotate slowly and a ride takes about 30 minutes. We have been on the Flyer both during daytime and in the evening. It is of course fabulous to see the lights over the nighttime city, but I do prefer the daytime ride as you then get a far better view of the city. Once we did the Singapore Sling option, i.e. you get a drink in your capsule. This time we were alone in our capsule. On other times there has been around 10 passengers in the capsule and then everybody has plenty of space and it is easy to move around and take pictures and enjoy the view.
There is usually no or a very short line for this attraction. The price is medium high, definitely cheaper than the London Eye. As a senior you get a discount. Make sure that you use the restrooms before the ride.
When in Singapore we usually stay at the Club level of the Marina Bay Sands and you of course have excellent views from the roof-top pool/terrace of the hotel, but the Flyer is something different and the view is more spectacular.",,,
,,Efficient for early birds,5,,"We arrived before opening time at 8.30am. First on, no queues, clear skies. Great views of town. We even got an over 60's discount. Not cheap for about 30 mins but worth it.",,,
,,Like the London Eye but Bigger,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a bit wheel offering impressive views of the Singapore area. During our visit there were only 5 of us in our capsule, which gave great opportunities to look around during the visit.

Easy to get to, with easy ticketing.

Great pre ""flight"" visitor centre area explaining the history of the attraction.

The wheel is about 35m (I think) bigger than the London eye - which should give a good indication of the size of the Flyer.

Great food in the centre under the Flyer, offering ""Hawker"" style stalls serving excellent and cheap food.

Would recommend pre-booking tickets during busy times to ensure you get on the attraction. We visited the day after the F1 Grand Prix and the whole area was quiet. The attraction is restricted to specific F1 ticket holders during the F1 weekend - so beware if visiting in late September.",,,
,,Flying High on Singapore Flyer,5,,"Extraordinary experience which provides an unequalled hawk's eye view of Singapore with comfortable gondolas and considerable security. The exceptional view of Singapore justifies the some what pricey trip making the Flyer a ""must"" during a visit to this unique destination.",,,
,,Amazing view and experience,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a fantastic way to see Singapore from up high and offers an incredible bird's eye view of the city. Before you reach the cable car, there is a long informative trail that details the history and construction of the flyer. We went on a Sunday and there was barely any queue. The car itself is quite large and we only shared the space with one other group so there was plenty of space to move around. The flyer rotates quite slowly and the ride takes around 30 minutes so there is a lot of time to take in the amazing view of the city. For S$33, the ride is a bit expensive, although you can benefit from minor discounts if you check with your hotel or tour bus. Make sure you drop by this attraction while visiting Singapore!",,,
,,Great views of the city,5,,Like most of the other huge ferry's wheels this one also gives you a great bird's eye view of Singapore and esp. the MBS and waterfront. There is also lots of Singapore street food in this same complex. Also had some nice Kaya toast near the entrance.,,,
,,Awesome views,5,,"A great attraction right on sunset, the flyer was nice and slow so you have time to take photos, loved the gardens underneath and the many types of eateries nearby as well. Good to do at start of trip to get your bearings. Better value than the Marina Bay Sands Skywalk.",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"We went on the Singapore Flier one evening after dark. The tickets are not cheap but the views are just spectacular, especially with all the lights at night time. We didn't have to queue and they don't put too many people in a capsule (we had 6 in total) so there is plenty of room to move around and see the views. I really think night time would be the best time to go on as the lights make the views amazing. Well worth doing.",,,
,,Stunning view,4,,"It's great if you come with others, soloist is not fun but i had a great time and got a lot of nice photos there.",,,
,,"A nice ride, interesting viewpoint.",4,,A unique way to look over the city and the bay. This was almost the only attraction that really let you tell you were on an island!,,,
,,Must go!,5,,We went there with elderly parents and 7 year old son. We were worried about our parents whether they would be able to move and out of moving cabin easily. The flyer staff were very helpful for elderly and helped parents in getting in and out of the cabin. The cabin is large and spacious. You are in the flyer for enough time to take plenty of photos of all sides. Strongly recommended.,,,
,,Magnificent!,5,,This attraction has some of the most amazing views of the city and harbour. The night view is particularly spectacular as all the lights of the city are incredible. It takes about 30mins for one rotation and there is plenty of room to walk around once onboard. The ride is very smooth and there is a great hawker stand in the same complex. A must do!,,,
,,Worthwhile,4,,"This is great to go at dusk, as the sun is setting, so you get to see a bit of the day and the lights at night.

Be prepared for some time to go thru all the great information about the Flyer before boarding (but after going thru the entrance and scanning your tickets). There's a wealth of information there and some pretty neat things to read about.",,,
,,Great view a bit expensive,4,,Went up between evening and sunset- best time to go! Expensive for a family of four but a good exprrience,,,
,,View of the City from the Sky,4,,"Approx. 40 minute flight in a very slowly moving SG flyer will give you an idea of size , beauty, planning of this smart and efficient city. It does come at a price which is not low by any means however in my opinion, it is worth visiting.
Tip - Best time to visit after 6 pm, as you can see the city being lit up during that hour provided you got tickets ready and dont have to wait in the queues for long.....This was our first experience in a Giant Observation Wheel , we loved it.",,,
,,Interesting,4,,Good afternoon out on holiday. Not the cheapest and could do with better sign-posting of sights etc or even audio commentary but otherwise decent. The views are pretty good and the ride very comfortable.,,,
,,Wonderful view,4,,"Oh im in love with this place, i can have full view of my lovely city, slowly scanthe beauty, how wonderful it is. The kids are very excited, point at many places they loved. Going here with family is a good idea",,,
,,Gorgeous view,5,,I celebrated my 30th wedding anniversary on top of the world in the Singapre Flyer. It was one of the best meals we had while in Singapore. Also we had a beautiful view and the whole experience was just amazing.,,,
,,Great views,4,,Did this early afternoon. There were no queues at the ticket office and no waiting time to board. Great way to see the singapore skyline. Not cheap but worth it.,,,
,,Nicey flyer,5,,The city view from there was so nice we were there on the best time time i think.it was evening and the sky was bright and clear and then it gets dark and on flyer you feel so much comfortable place.when we recieved on top of it .there was an announcement that u can make a wish and it was so pleasure.the flyer was big and nice and warmly.we feel cliser together and takes lots of photo,,,
,,Best Wheel I Ever Rode On!,5,,"Perched not too far from the Marina Bay complex, this amazing contruction is air conditioned, moves so smoothly it is barely perceptible by the eye and yet gets you up high in the air so you could see the spectacular panorama of this entire amazing area. Must see!",,,
,,Excellent way to view Singapore!,5,,"We took the Singapore Flyer one weekday morning, and it was not too crowded. It is well organised, and it was great to be able to find out where the different buildings and areas from the Singapore Flyer and it helped us when we got Down where to walk next etc. It was a big surprise for Instant to see how Close and Central the race course where. We are very happy that we took the Singapore Flyer!",,,
,,Beautiful views,5,,"Took a ride on the flyer at dusk. By the time we got to the top, the lights were on and the views were spectacular. Takes about 30 minutes for the entire ride, but well worth it.",,,
,,Exciting view,4,,"When you be first time in Singapore you have to visit this place in order to have a view from above.The ticket is some expensive for people from Europe.There is a small food place with ""authentic"" food of the place in the basement",,,
,,Fabulous view and certainly can tick this one off the list,5,,We had too do this as our Mums wanted to experience this for themselves and certainly wanted to see the view from the top of the wheel we went at night time as the city is so beautiful with all the lights etc. Were happy to do one rotation which takes approximately 30 minutes and the view was spectacular.,,,
,,Excellent facility and outstanding views!!!,5,,"We visited the Singapore Flyer during the mid morning which was a good time as it was before any crowds and provided a very enjoyable experience.

The rotation in the Flyer takes about half an hour and provides some really outstanding views of Singapore. The facilities around the flyer are well maintained and from my point of view this is an excellent tourist spot to visit.

While not cheap if you don't have it as part of a package as we did the views I think provide value for money and would recommend it to visitors who want to get a great view of Singapore from the birds eye point of view.",,,
,,Way up there,5,,Wow what an amazing feeling. Way up there above the city. I am scared of heights but didn't once feel like I was scared of anything.,,,
,,Beautiful views,4,,"Gives the best views in the dusk. May not give the full value for money, but if you haven't been to the top of another high rise building in Singapore, this definitely is the place.",,,
,,Brilliant..Love it!,4,,"Done this a couple of times both times in the day. 360 degree views and were lucky to get clear viewing. Not fast so you get time to do pictures etc. I guess young children might be over it fairly quickly but for adults it was good for us. You can see so far you can't take it all in..check it out!
Must do night visit next time:)",,,
,,Nice view all around,4,,"Get your cameras ready for some great photography aboard the S'pore Flyer. Spacious n nice. Could have more interesting outlets around this spot, too few. There's even special arrangement for candle lite dinner on board at night. Nice.",,,
,,Great City View,4,,Great way to view to get a 360 view of the city on a clear day. It takes a very leisurely 30 minutes to go around.,,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,Visited this attraction on our last day in Singapore. So glad we did. The cabins were spacious and gave 360 degree view of different parts of Singapore. The information displayed on the way to the cabin was very interesting and informative. It certainly is a must when visiting.,,,
,,2nd visit,4,,Really enjoyed our visit to the Singapore Flyer. It costs $33 per person and includes one round trip (30 mins approx). You get a fantastic view of Singapore and the opportunity to look from all angels.,,,
,,amazing,5,,great views in clean safe enviroment -not obtainable from any other way-so great----grandson loved it-his first experience on wheel---very smooth ride,,,
,,Not So Good.. But can be considered for one time,3,,"Singapore flyer is good for one time visit but please consider the below points.
Tips:
1. At the airport, in some tourist manual you will get good discount and food free on passport showing at flyer ticket counter.
2. Avoid weekends as the rush can take 2 hours or more and spoil the mood.
3. Avoid going in rains as view is not at all clear.
4. Better option would be Marina Bay Beach hotel terrace for the same view with the same price as of flyer.
5. Not so good in the night, but lights r good to see.
6. Not worth 20SGD(after discount price). Bettre to go Sentosa Island and enjoy something else in this cost.",,,
,,Nice views,5,,"A great way to see Singapore from a bird's eye view, especially if you have a good panoramic camera. We didn't ride here because we were booked at MBS and the view from the rooftop is also magnificent. It's nice to see both and to have pictures of each other.",,,
,,INCREDIBLE,5,,"I am very scared of heights, but this goes so slowly you would hardly know its moving. The view was just incredible and you could see everything. It is something you shouldn't miss, and if you are scared of heights, believe me, there is nothing that would make you frightened. It is worth every cent",,,
,,Love it,5,,"This is about the 4th time I have been on the flyer, and there is always something different to see. It was a beautiful clear day and you could see for miles. In front of the Sands there were hundreds of decorations floating in the river, with a very large 50 in the middle. This is there 50th anniversary of independents and it looked amazing from the flyer. Looking at the Gardens by the Bay from above just make you realize how big the Gardens and walkway across the top really are. We had someone who was scared of heights in our group and they loved it too....they were too scared to move from the seat but were really pleased they made themselves go on it.",,,
,,All aboard and all around,5,,"My first time to experience one of these so-called flyers. Always wanted to try and Singapore Flyer did definitely not disappoint. A magnificent view of all of Singapore and with a clear visibility we were able to see part of Malaysia in the horizon. It took just about 30 minutes to get all the way around, I believe it will take a bit longer when there is a lot of visitors. We were lucky to share a wagon or what you call it with only 6 other people so we had plenty of opportunities to take amazing pictures. The price is SD 25 per person and actually quite cheap compared to the London Eye. Some of the wagons are small restaurants which you can rent to have a dinner while going around. Fantastic concept which we would love to try one day.",,,
,,Brilliant views.. Sipping on Moet..,4,,"We had taken the Champagne option.. So the flyer capsule was exclusively available to only the two of us.. The views of Singapore are totally breathtaking.. The flyer itself is an engineering marvel.. We had paid USD 100 which included 30 mins on the flyer, one glass of Moet et Chandon, strawberries & chocolates.. For us I guess more than the champagne having the capsule to ourselves was perfect for the 360 degree photo ops.. A definite don't miss when in Singapore..",,,
,,View of Singapore city,5,,"Walk 15 minutes from Promenade MRT station. From the outside station you can see the Singapore flyer. Bought ticket for $33 per person. They put around 10 people in one capsule, so have enough space to walk around in the capsule to take photo. From top, can see the Marina Baysand, Singapore Grandprix and etc. Before you enter the capsule, they will ask you to pose and take photo of you. I thought the photo will be free, but actually it cost $20++, cant really remember. You will get the photo at the souvenir's shop.",,,
,,Spectacular views,5,,"We went early one morning. No queues. Fabulous views over the city, the Gardens By The Sea and the harbour. If you only have a short time it is worth doing this. Would be great at night with all the lights. If you are a senior don't forget your Seniors Card as you can receive a discount - we are from Australia and worth asking for. They were quite happy with our cards.",,,
,,Excellent,5,,"It is something you must try once. Don't think I would do it again, but great views of the city. We took the mrt to promenade station, the walk to the flyer was about 15 minutes. Make sure you use the washroom before you get on.",,,
,,Worth doing ....,4,,The Singapore Flyer gives you a fabulous view of this lush green and clean city. Next time I would book the one wi champagne ...they only do it at certain times so check it out before you go.,,,
,,Fantastic Views,5,,"The queue for the Singapore flyer was really short. We arrived there in the afternoon and the views are spectacular. The wheel moves so slow that you can stand up in the glass capsule while the flyer is rotating and have a 360 degree view of the bay area. This is definitely something you should try when you go to Singapore as you get to see a bird's eye view of the city.

Others have noted that its best to take this flight about 20 minutes before sunset as you get a view of Singapore during the day and the night. This would be the best option but we were unable to do this due to time constraints.

Overall, a must-see attraction while in Singapore.",,,
,,Awesome,5,,"It was amazing to see Singapore from a birds eye view.
Worth the money and the wait in line.
The cars are air conditioned!.
30-40 minutes well spent if you only have a bit of time in Singapore.
We went in the day time and could have easily gone back at night.",,,
,,Not recommended for Height phobia but Amazing flyer,4,,"Last year I tried cable car in Sentosa, then yesterday I tried Singapore Flyer.
Both of them really scared me because I had height phobia. Both capsule have glass screen where you can see all of Singapore. But it was a problem for height phobia! I wasted my time just sit in capsule, and not taking many photos while the others enjoyed the flyer so much!
I went on evening and the scenery was so good, I recommended you to ride this flyer than cable car, because the flyer rotated so slow, you can enjoy and take many Singapore photos.
The capacity of Flyer was around 8-25 people, my flyer only went with 11 people.",,,
,,Magnificent view of Singapore,5,,"Within 30 minutes per a ride, you will see breathtaking magnificent view of Singapore bay area including Marina Bay Sands and Garden By The Bay. Not too short nor too long time, you'll have one of great ferris wheel experience. Don't miss it !!!

We hope to come back here again but in night time for another breathtaking night view of Singapore.",,,
,,Give it a try,3,,"I'd say it's too expensive, but I'm glad we did it. You get good views of the city in all directions, and the gondolas are big enough to move around in and not too crowded.",,,
,,Great view from the city,4,,"We did this on a beautiful sunny day and the view from the city is great, although I think it would be much nicer at night.
I find $30 a bit pricey but was happy to go, since my son really wanted to go.

We went in the morning and there weren't many people there so we had a cabine just for us, which was great :)",,,
,,"A ""Must Go"" attraction for Locals & Tourists",5,,"Local people often teased each other not to visit our own local attractions but i totally beg to differ. There are many attractions, even myself as local must say they are pretty impressive and worth a visit to go! Our very own first Ferris Wheel in Singapore marks a very iconic landmark in our history and it became famous as one of the largest & highest standing ferris wheels in the world. I shall say my trip to Singapore Flyer was great and it brought my spouse & I much delight and we were proud to say this giant toy is truly safe and amazing. It actually can accommodate about 30 people in each carrier and you can vividly see 360 Deg magnificent views & sceneries of Singapore from every side within the compound. All thanks to the see-through glasses which makes the ride enjoyable and memorable. A trip down to Singapore Flyer is quite worth it for the 1st time, not recommended for a 2nd time visit unless you are bringing new friends or relatives for their 1st visit to Singapore. Hope my review helps a little. Thanks.",,,
,,Now we can say we have done it!,4,,"It was very well organized but getting there on the subway was a little confusing. There weren't signs at the closest station to tell us where to go. (Well we couldn't see them anyway)

Attendant was very obliging and gave my husband a Senior discount on the Australian card.",,,
,,Great,5,,Well worth a visit great views. takes about half an hour for one revolution. Views are great of the whole city and surrounds,,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"We loved this. We went at night, the night was clear and the view was amazing. Totally enjoyed our experience on the Singapore Flyer.",,,
,,Lovely views of Singapore,5,,"We really enjoyed our trip on the flyer, we went at dusk and saw the city light up, it looked beautiful so would definitely recommend going at this time (there were also no queues which was a bonus!)

There was a spectacular lightening storm when we were almost at the top, didn't feel too safe in a big metal wheel at the time but was a brilliant sight to see!

One criticism - there is no information in the capsules to tell you what landmarks you are looking at - in the London eye capsules there are tablets set up to show this at every window which would have come in handy here.

Overall would definitely recommend.",,,
,,Stunning View,5,,"What an amazing experience. Went with my family ( 3 adults, 2 young kids) . Since it's all about the view I would recommend doing it in the evening, so you could see the whole city lit up.",,,
,,Nice Experience,4,,"Flight was delayed because of thunderstorms. But we enjoyed the experience, once it was opened again. Maybe a bit pricey for what you get.",,,
,,Beautiful,4,,We had a wonderful ride after dinner at the Singapore Flyer. I think going there at night it鈥檚 a much better idea. There鈥檚 no queue and we pretty much jump into the cable car straight after we bought the ticket. The night view of Singapore is breathtaking. The lights of Gardens by the Bay and the ArtScience Museum are amazing. The flyer went pretty slow so there's no worry with elderly and children.,,,
,,A great way to see the sights,4,,"Great view, quick entry and not especially crowded. The lighting on the wheel makes any find of photography difficult.",,,
,,top of city,3,,"The Singapore Flyer is a colossal Ferris wheel in Singapore. Described as an observation wheel, It has 28 air-conditioned capsules, each able to accommodate 28 passengers, and incorporates a three-storey terminal building. The Flyer has an overall height of 165 meters and was the world's tallest Ferris wheel until the opening of the Las Vegas Strip in US; It is slow enough to let you enjoy the scenes. The height is amazing. A ride on the Singapore Flyer in the evening gives a breathtaking view of the city lights and marina bay, it could be possibly the most tedious activity if you are scared of heights, but if you enjoy been high in the sky you would love the achievement. The service could be improved. Going through the week is not busy, and there is no queue's. Note there is no toilet facility on board, I would recommend that you relief you self before adventuring into the 30 minute ride.",,,
,,Best time to visit? At dusk,5,,"We booked our Singapore Flyer experience about 90 minutes before sunset, and were excited by our choice.

First, there was absolutely no line, so we walked right up, bought our ticket, then walked to the attraction. No crowd, no hassle, which was terrific.

When we boarded, we were with only three others, so we had the entire car almost to ourselves. It was terrific to watch the city go from bright to lights during our ride.

When at dusk, you can see the buildings, the water, and the sights from day and then view them go into night. This, to us, was the best of both worlds.",,,
,,Great View,5,,"Worth the trip evn if just for the view, it is quick and efficient to get on board and then a slow and relaxing trip up into the sky. You rise to just below the level of the Marina Bay Sands and it truly is a great way to see an overview of Singapore.",,,
,,Nice view,3,,The Singapore Flyer was a nice stop while in Singapore. It provide nice views on a nice clear sunny day and really gave you great look on how expansive Singapore actually is.,,,
,,Just wow.,5,,"I was absolutely terrified of going on the flyer simply because I dislike heights and I've never liked the way you can feel a Ferris wheel move. The flyer was nothing like that. You can't feel it move at all. And the views... wow. No words could describe how beautiful the views were! The shops and restaurants below were a little pricey, but still nice to look around.",,,
,,Just ok,2,,With so many high rising buildings in Singapore u don't have to specifically get in the flyer to c around Singapore. It is very slow and if u have small children they get bored after the first 5 min.,,,
,,Worth the cost for a good view,4,,We had a great time on the flyer. We were going on a cruise so hopped on on the morning our ship docked. We could see it so well from the flyer it made the start of the trip so exciting.,,,
,,Fun!,5,,"A pleasant experience with the guys could see Singapore from a height of 165 metres.Really want to go back in there, especially at night with a partner",,,
,,Good view,4,,"Start with a long waiting, even I bought the tickets online was saying no waiting, but when we get there and they told us to wait anyway. The cabin is big and nice, the view is wonderful. This is only one time deal I think. Been there and done that.",,,
,,Fantastic sightseeing,5,,"It is a big structure that turns slowly, allowing the view of most of the city. The cabins are large enough for the number of persons embarked so that it is easy to move from one side to the other for taking pictures and to enjoy the 30 minutes jaunt.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"Visited late December for an afternoon ride. View during the day is terrific, and at night would be spectacular with city lights and gardens by the bay. Our 12yr old daughter was charged adult price as we didn't have iD to prove age, so more expensive than we had expected and the only attraction we visited that asked for ID.",,,
,,A pretty good way to get a good view of Singapore,4,,Allows you to see different parts of Singapore through the 360 degree cabin. Have been here several times and helps visitors get a quick look at the Singapore landscape. You may want to go just before it turns dark in the evening so that you get both a day and night review during the 30 minute ride.,,,
,,Must for Singapore!,5,,"Quick, easy, fantastic views. Must do!!! Day and night both have great views. Have been several times and always enjoyed it.",,,
,,Amazing Views of Singapore and Beyond,4,,The views from here are just amazing - very good for kids to enjoy. The wheel moves very slowly and makes for a calm and relaxed outing with very young kids.,,,
,,Nothing spectacular,3,,It was a slow ride and the views were really quite average. You might be able to get a better view from the surrounding buildings.,,,
,,Great experience,5,,We went on the flyer at night and it was magical. It had been raining so not many people turned up thus no queues! A lovely experience in this wonderful city.,,,
,,Nice Pace,5,,Very good value the wheel turns at a pace that gives you chance to view Singapore at its best very clean and the queue to get on moves quickly.,,,
,,This was a bittersweet experience,3,,"The view is unique no doubt. But, the cabin we got in was dirty. It even had a mild urine odour and the windows were not clean at all. Smudged, and apparently not cleaned in some while. A real shame considering the price and the potential of such an attraction.",,,
,,Dont miss this,4,,"The Flyer is good , You Can see the singapore city skyscraper and take good picture . The speed of the flier is slow and well managed.",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"A little expensive, but a must do. You can see the ships far into the horizon waiting to get into the busiest ports in the world! You can see the bay and the Garden by the Bay. I rode the Flyer in the mourning with clear skies and clear views of the city and the Ocean. Do not hesitate to ride it. It moves very slowly and gives you enough amount of time to get on. It was a great experience!",,,
,,flying high,5,,Excellent views of Singapore particularly the area around the Marina Bay complex including the race track. Slightly disconcerting to jump on and off a moving system. No overcrowding so excellent chance to move around and see everything.,,,
,,Great uninterrupted views.,5,,"Definitely worth the ticket price. At $33 it's not much at all and you have 30 min on the wheel.

Try to get there early to avoid the tour bus rush. I got there around 9:30 and had a gondola to myself. Half an hour later there were long queues.

There's not much you can't see from the Flyer and there's the obligatory goody shop on the way out. They take your picture and there's no pressure to buy one of their green screen photos.",,,
,,Good view,4,,"The 'cabin' was spacious but did not have any seating so we had to stand throughout or sit on the floor. It had a great view but nothing spectacular. If not for the great company, I would have been quite bored after a while. It would have been nice if we could have sat at a table and chair and enjoyed the view or at least taken some food with us to munch.",,,
,,What a wonderful experience,5,,"Was a wonderful experience. Really fast, clean and a safe experience. Give it a try. ...................",,,
,,Amazing View,4,,We enjoyed this ride with a very amazing view of the Singapore city night view. But it was a long queue and crowded. Can get the dinner in the flyer car too but it was very expensive. Expensive everywhere in Singapore.,,,
,,Birds Eye view of the city,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is an attraction that you must try once, but once is quite enough. This slow moving observation wheel (supposedly the tallest outside USA) takes you high up and provides you a birds eye view of the city. The entire revolution takes about 30-40 mins allowing you to take a leisurely view of the surroundings.",,,
,,great views,4,,"I must confess, I'm scared of heights - but if you're in Singapore - this is one for the bucket list. From the top, one can see the Singapore Grandprix, the Flower dome, Marina by the bay, The Esplanade and Theaters by the bay. For the price its definitely worth it. Besides the Flyer are great restaurants and local foods.",,,
,,Birds Eye View of Singapore,5,,"walk from Merlion park or Marina Bay sands / Shopps
you can get a birds eye view of the beautiful city
one round trip lasts for 30 mins, buy the tickits on line and can visit any time of that date within the working hours
go in the evening time such that you can see how the city looks in both eve time and night time",,,
,,Best Flyer ever Seen,4,,"It is the Best Flyer we visited in the world. Provided nice view of the city, the sea shore and Merlin",,,
,,Good few hours out.,5,,"We took our parents on the flyer whilst they were here on holiday. We booked our tickets online & printed so when we arrived we could go straight into the attraction.
We parked in the parking across the road & walked across the bridge at level 2. This took you straight yo the attraction entrance.
We were practically a walk on after arriving at around 12 noon on a Saturday. We shared the flight capsule with another family hit the 30 minute flight & was able to get some good photos of gardens by the bay & marina bay as well as the cbt. There are places to grab a bite to eat & drink in the complex too. It was a good few hours out, longer if you need to queue.",,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,"Forget the research on the ticket prices, as singapore flyer is not something you should save your money on. The flyer is all about the views, it keeps you in awe during the whole ride. From the top the view is simply stunning, i would recommend hoing in the evening, when everything is lit up.",,,
,,Romantic Heights,4,,Feel you are captured in a capsule where you could walk roam n look at the beauty of the Singapore. You just don't feel it's moving but moves really slow taking about 30 mins for one round,,,
,,Very nice experience,4,,It is slow enough to let you enjoy the scenes. I took some nice pictures with the family. The height is amazing and i would say it's a must see.,,,
,,Once in a while,5,,A good place to view the entire Singapore in a bird's eye with all the buildings and structures. The candle light dinner theme is really inviting and should be tried upon on the top of the sky,,,
,,A memorable experience,5,,"A ride on the Singapore Flyer in the evening gives a breathtaking view of the well lit city, the river that gives way to the bay and finally joins the sea, the twinkling boats on the water, the bustling dockyard and of course the fantastic skyline of this beautiful city.The flyer moves slowly with a total ride time of half an hour for a complete rotation. The compartments are spacious with well managed pressure regulators and other precautions. It is also an excellent view to see thw flyer in the Singapore skyline from down under or while the flight approaches the city while landing.",,,
,,Boring,1,,This is possibly the most boring activity in all of Singapore. The flyer spins at a snail's pace. The service is absolutely terrible. There's a lot of better ways to spend 30 minutes of your time.,,,
,,Spectacular views.,5,,"If you enjoy heights you'd love this, air conditioned units with seats in the middle(which I clung to) Great views, goes very slow so worth the money. We went through the week so it was lovely and quiet with no queue's. Make sure you visit the loo first otherwise you have to hang on for a while.",,,
,,It was an experience,4,,I am scared of heights but accompanied my husband after lot of hesitation. But the experience was something one has to experience for themselves. The view was stunning and we were told if you go during the day you could see part of Indonesia. We went in the night.,,,
,,Loved this!,5,,"Even though this may seem touristy, it was amazing. My friend and I went at sunset, no wait, saw the bay, the Marina Bay Sands and much more. It was very nice, and they do not fill the pods to full. Great time!",,,
,,Rude Photographer!,1,,"Prior to entering a ""cabin"", a person directed us to stand at a certain place and then, he proceeded to take photos of us.

I told him that I didn't want our photos to be taken.

He angrily stared at us and waved us to get out.

He could have asked whether we would like our photos to be taken by him in the first place but he didn't.

Totally unacceptable behaviour. Very rude!",,,
,,A sunset visit is best,3,,"i love big wheels, but there is something just a miss with the Flyer. A lot of empty parking towers and not a overly easy place to get to (relative to almost everything else in Singapore that is) and once you get there you are faced with a lot of very quiet shops. The ride itself is super, with great views. If you can only do one of this or the Marina Bay observation deck, give this a miss. Still you won't be overly disappointed with the Flyer.",,,
,,Well worth a visit!,5,,The views of Singapore are magnificent. And on a clear day you can see Indonesia! Really spacious gondolas which are very clean and offer a 360 degree view.,,,
,,A great way to start a holiday,5,,"We started our Singapore vacation with Singapore flyer, champagne and strawberries. A nice view over the city from the flyer.",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,it is very well maintained and gives you nice view of the city. i have experienced the one in london and was not very sure if i would like to take this experience but take my word it was worth every penny.,,,
,,Flying over Singapore,5,,"Finally we had a chance to experience the Singapore Flyer on our third visit and it didn't disappoint. A lovely experience especially as we were able to have a condola just for our family.

Amazing views and a lovely time out time to relax type of adventure.

We also loved the amazing fish pond with beautiful koi and the food mall, whilst hot did have lovely food. Some lovely restaurants also available.

Enjoy.",,,
,,Overrated,3,,"Overpriced! Very slow moving. We had a bunch of uncontrolled kids in our car. If you have some money to waste then go for it,otherwise skip it. You can get a free view from some nearby rooftops.",,,
,,Must Experience,4,,Gives view of whole city. you will find a room like place to sit or stand in Marry go round :) Must visit the place.,,,
,,Once is enough,4,,Excellent view from up there but the ride is just too long for my liking. Lucky thing I didn't have to go toilet during the ride.,,,
,,City Lights,5,,"Great views at night. So if you have a chance, do a night tour but be ready with your cameras for the great opportunities afforded to you as the wheel slowly spins around its axis.",,,
,,Fabulous camera opportunities,5,,"Similar to other ""wheels"" in other cities but gives agreatopportunity to see the entire city and get some perspective on the cleverness of its design. Great photo opportunities and little waiting the day we were there.",,,
,,Long face and merciless staff,1,,"We bought four e-tickets from CTrip in advance and took my kid to go and take the Sinagpore flyer. Unfortunately, we could not find the entrance. After we found it, it was about 19:40. A member of staff (a strong lady) at the ticket office told us the e-ticket was only valid before 19:30 (Honestly, I did not notice the small letters about the conditions). I told her it was our last day in Sinagpore, hope she can let us in. But the strong lady still kept her long face and rejected to provide any further assistance. As they were unrefundable tickets, we wasted about 450 RMB.",,,
,,must visit,5,,"For me, this was a must visit. What a structure. One can also try hand at Flight Simulator though little costly.",,,
,,Awesome City and Ocean view,5,,"A 30 Minute ride of the flyer wheel will take you round the city as well the ocean spectacular views. Best time to go is in the evening around 5:30 to enjoy the sunset with city lights. Can avail 10% discount if booked online. can go for a dinner ride in the flyer as well but that is expensive. Overall , a must go attraction in Singapore ...",,,
,,Great but gets a bit boring if you hate heights,3,,"My teenage sons enjoyed it, as they have no fear of heights. As a height hater, I had to sit the whole time and felt pretty uneasy. It's very slow, which is great to observe the view, but it feels like it goes on forever. I've marked it as an average, but keep in mind that it's from the perspective of a person who hates heights, so it's actually quite a good rating!

Very expensive - about $130.00 for a family of four. Worth it? Hmm? Not sure. It's one of those things you try once and won't ever have to do again. We did it at night, and the city lights look lovely from the air.",,,
,,View from skyhigh,5,,"I went there with my wife.She has height mania, but after we started our journey from the ground she felt that , there is no fear . the speed of flyer is slow and easy bearing. From that much height I enjoyed sight seeing.",,,
,,Great views of the city,4,,It was surprisingly slow the day we went. We received 20% off by presenting our Singapore Airlines boarding passes. We had our own capsule so we were able to get a great view from all sides. We went during the day but I would recommend going at sunset or at night. I am sure the lights of the city make the view even more spectacular.,,,
,,Average,3,,Our Singapore Flyer experience in August was just above average I would say. Bit overpriced but good to see whole country from top.,,,
,,Cool views!,4,,"Worth the visit to see the whole city. We went at night so the city was in the lights. A bit scary for those who are affraid of heights, but survivable :)",,,
,,Stunning views,5,,This is a really great way to see Marina Bay. The flyer takes you to the heights of the Sands hotel in a gentle ride that simply soars above the ground.,,,
,,"Views , views and more views",4,,"The Flyer is worth the money. Well maintained , excellent staff and very clean. Area is base for many more activities. Some small restaurants over inexpensive local foods. Toilet facilities are clean and user friendly. The unit is clean and we were lucky to have a whole unit to ourselves . Views are spectacular.",,,
,,Costly 30 min ride,3,,I been to few of flyers across the globe but this one was the most expensive.. Though in case if you are the first times in flyers then this won't be a disappointment :) if gives good view of the entire Singapore... But I rate among all the flyers in the world to London Eye...,,,
,,"Do it, do it, do it",5,,We chose this on our first evening in Singapore and agreed that there's no better way to experience the panoramic beauty of the city & it's waterfront than under lights atop the Flyer. A romantic & beautiful way to kick start our tour of a very lovely city.,,,
,,View from the top,4,,"I was a little skeptical of the Singaore Flyer but found the experience well worth it. A great aerial vantage point over Singapore, which allows you to get a full understanding of the complexities of this highly urbanised and dynamic island.

The trip takes around 30 minutes and is just long enough.
There is a great selection of food stalls below. Choose from Indian, Malay, Chinese etc. Soups, satays or curries to fill your belly after the Flyer experience.

The enclosed rainforest garden feature on the ground floor, with carp pond and small paths adds a nice contrast to the engineering mechanics of the flyer.
Be there or be square.",,,
,,Beautiful View,4,,This is a perfect choice if you want to see Singapore from the heights. Very beautiful and you can see everything!!!!!!!!,,,
,,Great views,4,,tickets discounted with SIA boarding passes. Went on a Saturday afternoon and just a short 10-15mins wait.,,,
,,Not the best place.,4,,"Went here as far as memory serves it was $35 in each, but I coudl be wrong. It was ok, we went during the day, we then met a local who told us not to waste our money going here but to visit 1-Altitude instead, it was just as expensive in but we got a free drink upon entry and when we got up to the top of the building we were easily twice the height of this building if not more!",,,
,,Eye in the sky,5,,Great fun at night. Lights are brill. Excellent value for money with good restaurants and stalls close by,,,
,,Scenic views,5,,Enjoyed the ride on the flyer. Went in the morning before tours arrived were able to have car to selves. Great views over Singapore inland and out to sea. A highlight for any visit would go again.,,,
,,On top of Singapore,5,,The wheel is about 165m high and the rotation is very very smooth. We had lot of snaps of the city from inside the capsule. We had gone during day time but I can imagine the view would be exciting when the lights are on.,,,
,,Kids love it,4,,Been here once several years ago. We went during promotion period because the tickets without promotion is very expensive for us. Not many tourist therefore waiting time less than 10min. The cabin is big enough. Kids will love it. The flyover journey took about 30min. There is a small park beside. You are able to purchase Duck Tour ticket at here also.,,,
,,"Expensive, but great sights",2,,"We visited the flyer (after living in Singapore for a while) and we found that it was at a very expensive cost, which I could tell was very inconvenient for people traveling here with a normal budget. The views were amazing but we were forced into a cart with other people who were extremely obnoxious. Would`t come back here again.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer ....,2,,"Comparatively isn't much to see from the flyer. It overlooks the Marina Bay and towers over the Marina Bay Sands Casino. MBS is just walking distance away

It's better to go to Level 33 at MBFC.You will get a better get view from Level 33. It is on the 33rd floor. You can see Batam island at a distance

At the same time enjoy great dinner. You would not be confined to the clamp ride. You are free to walk around and take great pictures

You can walk around the place to view the scenery or the night life plus have a spectular view of the Marina Bay as well as hundreds of ships in the Straits of Singapore.

It is a great place to see sunset

It has its own mirco-brewery. You can also come in after 9 to a good beer

Prices are reasonable

I must add the service is Great

Great for couples too,",,,
,,What a flight,5,,More than matches the London Eye. A great experience with tremendous views of the Singapore skyline and beyond. A must.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"I have to be honest as I had no intention of getting anywhere near this structure as I hate heights, but on arriving and seeing the size of the capsule, my fears went and all my family loved it. The view is absolutely amazing. Takes about 30 minutes to go around and if you can get a capsule on your own, which we did, it makes it more personal, Would definitely do again.",,,
,,Good view. Expensive though,4,,This was an expensive trip and they really tried to flog the photos at the end. You have to resist it. It cost 15 dollars for a boring photo. People have to make a living I suppose but there's a whole team working on the photos. There's nowhere to get a decent coffee from the kiosks below. Good view you have to say and worth the visit but at about 99 dollars it was pricey.,,,
,,First Time,5,,This is one of the best singapore attrection. I came here with my Husband. It was a very slow romentic weel move and to view the beautiful lights up Singapore. Thumbs Up!!,,,
,,Striking place to visit day or night,5,,"We did it by night so not too busy,we had a great view of the sights and lights of Singapore . Visit the night food markets under neath for a cheap and cheerful meal and low cost tiger beer .",,,
,,"Gorgeous Views, Go around sunset.",5,,"The Flyer is such a gorgeous experience, i've done lots of observation wheels and I found this one to be my favourite, go near sunset!! There is also a few things to in the building below like the fish foot bath.",,,
,,Fabulous Experience,5,,Brilliant view over Singapore an attraction you must do rom the moment you board it is the wow factor it takes about 35 minutes to complete an incredible experience,,,
,,Amazing views,4,,"This is a must when visiting Singapore. Amazing views of the city and beyond gives time to appreciate the incredible architecture of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the science and art museum and much more. The half hour trip seemed to pass quickly but memories of the stunning views will last forever",,,
,,Beautiful scenery,5,,"We visited The flyer on the first day we came to Singapore.We had a great time in there.The view was breath-taking.Looking down on the F1 Racecourse was great.You can take pictures of the Singapore skyline,the harbour,Marina bay sands sky park,Gardens by the bay and many more.The view from the top was stunning and awesome!!!!!!The ride took about 45 minutes.There are some restaurants and stalls underneath the flyer.There is also a photo booth so you can take a picture of your family with the Singapore flyer which will be a nice memory for you.....",,,
,,Will even seduce those scared of heights,4,,"We had bought a two day attractions pass and driven by on the bus. Partner was scared of heights, but the walk up passage and platform hid the height of the entrance to the cabin. The cabin moves at such a slow steady pace that you are able to enjoy and be stunned at the view over Singapore. As numbers are limited in the cabin there is plenty of room to stand up and move around as well as sit when you wish. Everyone was helping take photo's of others and point out items of interest. The passage of time is not noticeable and we found the cabin at the top and heading down and before we knew were back to the bottom and exiting. Value for money yes, great experience yes. The view at night would be fantastic, but check weather as if smoggy/smoky it impacts on the distance of view.",,,
,,Beautiful Sunset,5,,"We couldn't decide whether to spend the money on this or not- especially after spending 9 singapore dollars on an ice cream outside (but so good).
But we thought only in Singapore once? so we should just do itttt.
And so glad that we did! It was stunning- the views and the sunset was beautiful.
We were also on it for the perfect amount of time.
There's also a bit to look around before you go onto it- some cute waterfalls and gardens, places to eat and bathroom facilities, as well as a little bit of a museum- telling you about the flyer and showing you models etc.
Worth going on- you can see some incredible views of the city...",,,
,,Be on the lookout for good weather!,3,,The Flyer was on the to-do-list of our nephew who came to visit us in Singapore. Looking down on the F1 racecourse was fantastic. Taking pictures of the Singapore Skyline was great. Seeing down to Indonesia and up to Malaysia was wonderful. We treasure the pictures we were able to shoot and take with us as a memory. Although the Flyer it is rather on the expensive side for such a short time of enjoyment.,,,
,,View from the top,4,,"Singapore Flyer area can get pretty busy with Bars, restaurants and the Singapore trail of eateries ala hawker stalls right underneath the Flyer. Best time for me was at sundown and hopefully it's not to busy so you can calmly walk around your capsule to take the view of Singapore skyline. Do bring a camera, but put it up against the glass to avoid reflection. They have a champagne and snack deal that you can purchase and your ride could get pretty romantic! The ride goes one full circle which last about 30 to 45 min. The view of Singapore is absolutely beautiful with all the light. The service and attention from the attendants or staff was very good. Though it was a very good experience once is enough for me.",,,
,,Nice ride,3,,Nice view - we had no line nor crowds - if we had - would not have waited. Something to do. Windows clean for photos. About 30 minutes.,,,
,,The Biggest Ferris Wheel,5,,"I'm very excited that this is the largest ferris wheel in the world. Love the city view from the high....like an eagle eye, recommended time is around the twilight....when the sun is starting to set :')",,,
,,Loved it,4,,Good view from above as you are up and have a good view of the entire city. A bit scary for people who have issues with heights.,,,
,,Stunning,5,,"Its hard to find the right time of day or night to go, its best an hour after it rains! During the day or night. The pods are so large and relaxing. Views are breathtaking you can see almost everything. Worth a visit!",,,
,,nothing great,3,,the singapore flyer experience is good but after few minutes it becomes boring and you'll start looking at your watch. gives you a good view of singapore.,,,
,,Amazing view,4,,The flier of singapore is the best giant wheel i have ever been to the view from the flier includes the flyovers over singapore city the racing track bay and the whole singapore looks soo buitiful from the flier and the speed of flier is very slow so it does not occer any presure to have one rotation it takes about 45 mins. So u have a lot of time to expernce it,,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,"Without this, your Singapore trip is incomplete...visit during sunset..the entire ride takes 35-40 mins. The view is incredible. The skyscrapers, marina bay, riverfront, port area.",,,
,,Over hyped,3,,"This flyer gives a nice look of the country from the top but essentially there is nothing to see around. There is just water on one site and marina bay sands on the other. Rest is boring. Only the first 3-5 minutes are good otherwise it was soooooo boring and I was waiting it to end. Not worth the price, one time ride maybe for travelers.",,,
,,"Good value, great views",4,,"We only had 2 days in Singapore and so we were keen to get a feel for the layout of the city. The flier, a huge Ferris wheel, is a great way to see the different areas of the city, the dam wall that separates the city's reservoir from the bay, the many ships waiting to dock and some of the amazing architecture.

Much better than the sky park.",,,
,,PANORAMIC VIEW OF SINGAPORE VIA THE FLYER,5,,"The Flyer will present S'pore in different environment be it the residential, harbour or financial district.

Best time to see S'pore is around 6.30pm where you can catch the sunset with the beautiful breathtaking views of S'pore. The Management has dressed the Flyer during the Xmas and Chinese Lunar Year with signs of Xmas tree and the Chinese character of Spring to herald in the different joyous seasons.

The Flyer is as interesting as the London Eye where it is spacious and you can move around for your favorite view.

You can also reserve the carriage for an important event at a certain price.",,,
,,Great view!,4,,"We went during the sunset and managed to see the spectacular night view of the city. Just wish that there's some sort of information on the surrounding buildings or attractions seen from the flyer. Overall, the price is worth it for the view.",,,
,,Great views around Singapore from every angle!,5,,"A brilliant ride - it takes about 30 minutes and we had a pod to ourselves so just wandered from window to window to take in as much as possible. Highly recommended - very good value, too!!",,,
,,"boring, boring and boring",2,,"no point to visit, better to rent a movie or take a stroll along the bay area.... more interesting queuing at counter than the ride itself....",,,
,,360 paranomic view,5,,Very beautiful view of the Singapore skyline . Went up twice actually -- once during the day to take a client up and once at night with my family. I would say each time of the day allows you to view Singapore in their respective unique look and feel!,,,
,,Great views over the city.,4,,"We were lucky to walk straight into one of the pods for a ride on this wheel - no waiting. This is reputed to be the largest wheel of its kind in the world. It moves slowly enough to take in good views as far as the airport, over the harbour, the Bay Gardens and the city.
The wheel is built above the F1 racetrack, which in turn encompasses gardens - amazing design and architecture! It's well worth the entry fee.",,,
,,Still worth it,4,,Still a great view ... needs a commentry or map so tourists xan pin point some buildings etc but good,,,
,,Great views!,4,,"Terrific news of the whole city, definitely worth doing at least once. Do try to go on a clear day or night, as you can see for miles if it is clear. Take your camera!",,,
,,Spectacular views,4,,"The flyer is something you simply can't miss. Beautiful location based. Spectacular views. Stunning photos. Situated right above the Singapore Grand Prix circuit, you can see the grand stand and also witness the beautiful Marina Bay Sands. Sit. Enjoy. Relax the half hour ride.",,,
,,Great Views of Singapore,5,,"Best views of Singapore are from the flyer. Morning is the best time to go as it can get very busy with waiting times. Excellent clean compartments, worth a visit even if just for pictures of the skyline.",,,
,,Round and round,5,,within a nice complex. We arrived in the evening and headed straight to here. Evening views were stunning and taking in the harbour and beyond. Saw really far and clear on a good night and at the footfall for the Grand Prix Track. Shame Singapore kept me too busy to try again in the daytime.,,,
,,"Iconic, great view & just one part of the city that is an adult ""playground""",4,,"One of the slowest ferris wheels I have every seen but certainly will allow you to take in all that is Singapore. Located on the water with great views of many iconic Singapore attractions, if you aren't afraid of heights and have 1hr to spend, I recommend it.",,,
,,Excellent,5,,"The view was very facinating. You can see the F1 track, Marina Bay, and also the city. The staffs were friendly.",,,
,,Magnificent view!,4,,"The first time I have tried this was with my Mum Feb 2013 10AM. The view is spectacular but kind of boring, color of the city is dull however, the view from Marina Bay Sands to Gardens by the bay is AWESOME!! There is this rewarding feeling. You'll be able to see the most of SG in few minutes that even in the middle of the business district, you'll find the fresh greens and oh, great architecture.

This Sept 2014, me and my Fianc茅 went here to try SG Flyer at night. The city is lively, vibrant, full of lights and makes you appreciate the details of each attraction but you'll only find darkness in Gardens By the Bay areas. If they could only put any light on it. Highlights or whatever they could do to actually emphasize the attraction even at night. Anytime of the day will be spectacular.",,,
,,Great view,5,,"This was on my must do list and was very glad I did so. No queuing at all. It takes 30mins to do one rotation and that probably was enough time to see everything and take all the pictures you need.
There are other things to do in the small complex when you finish including picking up a tour bus of Singapore, which I thought was great as these are a good economical way of seeing a lot in a short time.
Worth visiting in my opinion",,,
,,Great way to view the city,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is a giant Ferris wheel with an overall height 165 meters (540 FT). A little too high for me.
The Flyer has 28 air-conditioned glass capsules providing continuously unobstructed views of the city. Each capsule can hold up to 28 passengers and is wheel chair accessible.",,,
,,The best place to see Singapore,5,,"This place is the best place to enjoy Singapore's view. From the top of Flyer, you can see the whole Singapore's symbols such as Marina Bay Sand Skypax, Garden by The Bay. This place is also the station where you can catch Duck tour or Zoo tour or City Tour. If you combine Duck Tour with Singapore Flyer, you can get a better deal.",,,
,,Trip in the sky,4,,"Great experience, wonderful views of Singapore from a new aspect. 30 minutes well spent with lots of photo opportunities.",,,
,,SG bird's eye view from the flyer,4,,"Stunning 360 degrees view from the capsule , towards Singapore in a 40 minutes ,flyer turn around.Ticket was a bit expensive but worth the ride ,at least twice ,day time and evening time.
Amazing color of Singapore lights and the sunset could be experienced on the evening.Perfect moment for photo taking.",,,
,,Nice Views,4,,"Our first thing to see in Singapore, nice from which you can see alll from above. Best to go at sunset so you watch it from above",,,
,,Nice but expensive city views,4,,"Get a nice city view, good to visit both during day or night @ S$33/28. Ride for 30 mins open till 10pm. You can experience the dancing light show at marina bay and gardens by the bay also if you manage to be there between 8 and 8 30pm. Very good restaurants available for indulgence or you can enjoy nice variety of both local and indian food at the ground floor of the building and do try the crushed flavoured ice there.",,,
,,Wheel,5,,This is the same as the London eye . Good value here though you get great views of Singapore . The hop on hop off bus stops here,,,
,,Sky is not the limit,5,,"Enjoy your tea, beer or food with the world's largest rotating restaurant......really a good experience one should enjoy....",,,
,,Worth doing,4,,"At 拢17 per head its a little pricy, but you get to see relatively good views of Singapore. I thought the experienced lacked a little sole. If this is your first visit I would suggest: the zoo, orchid and botanical gardens are much better. Whilst a tour of the island would give you a better feel for the place.",,,
,,Dont go there,2,,"Waste of money going there. Not worth it. You would get so many better views from other rooftop bars in Singapore(Kudeta, Level 33).",,,
,,Almost the whole city,5,,its a birds eye view of almost all the significant structures of Singapore city. Concept is just like the London Eye but still it has its significant 360 view of the whole city. Worth it...,,,
,,The view from the top,5,,"Singapore Flier has 28 Capsules and can hold upto 28 people.The seating is comfortable and the pace is perfect .The views are amazing at night with the lighting etc though the ticket is costly for night view
Gives a good view of the skyline and all iconic buildings of Singapore",,,
,,Sights from above,4,,"It was a good experience though after a while, it does get boring as the car moves quite slowly. Take lots of pictures, try going there by 4 pm or so and by the time you are climbing down you get to see the day and night view at the same sitting!",,,
,,Excellent attraction to start your Singapore sightseeing,5,,"We had booked online tickets for this attraction from India. We went to see this attraction the day we landed in Singapore.

An excellent way to have a quick glimpse of Singapore city and also the sea on the other side. It takes almost 35-40 mins to complete a ride so you have plenty of time to click photos as much as you want. You also need to see the Marina Bay from the flyer. A unique experience in itself. A must go attraction. Try to go to this attraction on the first day itself, if possible.

Some good restaurants at the entrance of the attraction to fill your tummies.",,,
,,View of SG as none other,5,,"The Singapore Flyer provides a very good overview of city and its dotting skyscrapers from the above. From within the capsule,one can see Gardens by the Bay, the Marina Bay Sands and the YOG Park. The Capsule is quite safe and one can spend hours taking snaps if not for the revolution. Definitely worth the money. Its better to opt for the Singapore Flyer Pass A or B to get a better bargain for which one can book it on-line or purchase it off the counter.",,,
,,Nothing special,3,,"Good view from high up, but nothing special other than good view. Very steady, can't feee any shaking even windy outside.",,,
,,Must visit,5,,The Singapore view from top is awesome and its a unique place to try in city. I would recommend everyone should try during evening time. Normally it takes around 45 minutes for the whole wheel to revolve and get back.,,,
,,Only 30 minutes,4,,"It would have been better if it was an hour to compensate for the fee.But it was fun. Part of Singapore can be seen on a clear day. I couldn't find where Malaysia and Indonesia is, as it was in the ads.",,,
,,Excellent,5,,"Great birdseye view from the capsule especially during the night. The Keppel Club golf course hightlight the beauty if open field. Towards ECP, a sight not to be missed for photography",,,
,,Excellent view of the city,5,,We tried out the Singapore Flyer in the morning and it was really awesome. The view was beautiful and the ride took a total of around 40-45 mins.,,,
,,not a regular ferris wheel,4,,fully airconditioned and (if booked) catered cabins with breathtaking views. best done first thing when visiting Singapore so you can observe what and find places to visit. Botanical gardens are 2nd on the list.,,,
,,Soak in the beatiful view of Singapore for 30 minutes,4,,"Even though the ticket is costly, however it is worth the money to soak yourself in the beautiful view of Singapore skyline for 30 minutes. Exterior looks exactly like the London eye.",,,
,,Unforgetable fly,5,,"One thing I will remember always.
Fantastic view ovet the city and seaside.
Feels also very safe and ther is enough room in the capsule to move around and take photos.
The fee wasnt too high but stil getting in was smooth and did not take time waiting.",,,
,,Save your money elsewhere,1,,"Badly maintained interior and expensive price tag for a view which is high up but not impressive. Duration of about 30mins, cramped with strangers and really looking at things from a higher height, without live commentary.

Ticket can amount to a good lunch at any better restaurants with a better top view and more comfortable setting.",,,
,,Great view on top of SG,4,,The view from Singapore Flyer is great but we have to spend quite long time as the Flyer quite slow. Nothing to do during we're in the Flyer except taking photo and enjoy the view in top. Anyway still recommended to try the Flyer to see great SG view.,,,
,,City View,4,,"We went during the day and we saw the expanse of the city, the buildings and the surrounding waters. Takes about 30-45 minutes for the whole ride. There are cafes below where you can get snacks after the ride and a garden as well.
The capsule is very safe and on a lean day you can have it by yourself!",,,
,,Terrifying,5,,"I'm terrified of heights, even though I realise how irrational the fear is. But I mustered up the courage and took the plunge. First of all, the main reason I was scared of this particular ride is being stuck on it for 30 minutes with no way off. After the first half, I relaxed and began to enjoy the trip for what it was. The wheel offers amazing views of the city and moves very slowly. We went up at night time, and while I probably wouldn't do it again, it was definitely worth doing once.

If you're afraid of heights, I strongly recommend you try garner the courage to try this, you might be scared for a while, but you won't regret it.",,,
,,Nice view,4,,"Guys if u wanna get the sunset view singapore. U try boarding @1830hrs singapore time, nice view of the city on sunset.",,,
,,Not my cup of tea.....,2,,It takes 30 minutes to go one round and yes the views are great but there are sure much better views and you dont even need to pay for it so just head up to 1 Altitude bar which is the highest roof top bar in the world and you can in a clear day see 3 countries. They have also a dining service at Flyer but havent heard any good reviews of it. It is really a tourist type thing so........,,,
,,Do if you absolutely have the time,3,,"Great view of the city, but not the must do if you're here in Singapore. The F&B here are also not the greatest, unless you head over to say Suntec, Esplanade or MBS for food.

However, during festive seasons and such, and potential fireworks, this may be an option to spend the half hour ride.",,,
,,Fantastic,4,,We went for ride in night. The scene was fabulous one can see whole Singapore from there & just can't stop clicking pictures. It's worth trying though little expensive with 33$.,,,
,,Nothing extraordinary!,3,,"High expectations of certain places tend to disappoint more often than not. Learnt it in a mild-way (if not harsh!).

Singapore flyer is nothing to rave about. Though this is one of the biggest observatory wheel in the world it did not seem to amaze at any given point of time.

We chose the flyer over going to Gardens by the Bay & genuinely believed it was a wrong choice.",,,
,,Aerial Singapore,4,,"After business meetings we had some time before heading to the airport, so we passed a very peasant hour at the Flyer. The wheel itself takes 30 minutes and gives lovely views over Singapore, a great way to get an idea of the city in one go, especially as we and a short, packed schedule and didn't have time for sight seeing. There is a lovely lush garden at the bottom where one can sit and ponder , as well as the obligatory gift shop and other shops on the site. There was also a spa where you can have fish nibble at your feet as one of the treatments. Altogether a very pleasant way to while away an hour or so in Singapore.",,,
,,Best Views Of Singapore!,5,,"Recently spent 45 minutes travelling on the Singapore Flyer, probably one of the best views of Singapore that you will find. Well worth the experience, very comfortable gondolas with panoramic views over the city, Marina Bay area as well as the gardens on harbour areas. Highly recommended, one of the top ten things to do while visiting Singapore. Plenty of tourist type shops in the complex, plus a variety of restaurants to feed the hungry mouths!",,,
,,Worth trying once,3,,"You know you're still in Singapore, as you can never be more than a few yards from a shopping mall, and this attraction has not been spared.
You make your way up the escalators though the various shops at each level before you reach the main entrance.
As this is a flight, you have to go through airport security before you're allowed in. Will they reimburse you if you fail?
Get ready to get your photo taken in case you forget you've been on this flight. Maybe, they should do the same before boarding any flight at airports?
After various motivational and hype inducing flashing messages and posters about living the dream, you finally make it to your capsule.
If you're lucky to be selected, you might get asked if you would like to upgrade to the VIP capsule that includes Champagne and a table with flashing lights.
No, thanks, we just want a normal capsule.
After a 40 minute ride, you are released back into the hands of the photographer and the souvenir shop.
It would have been nice to get a commentary or a map of the various landmarks.",,,
,,Well worth trying once,3,,"Just remember that you are in Singapore, and hence you cannot be more than a few metres away from a shopping mall, and this is exactly what this place is like instead of just letting you experience the ride and enjoy the simplicity of it all.
As you walk towards the capsules, get ready to be scanned and searched airport style.
Then you have to go through a maze of motivational posters, rooms, lights to get you psyched up for your flight dream.
If you're lucky, you might get asked to ride in the VIP capsule with flashing lights on the table and a Champagne reception, at a price of course.
Once in your capsule, you're left alone for the 35 minutes, although some optional commentary would have been useful to tell you about the various landmarks.
A little disappointed that we did not get our flight badges!",,,
,,Great views at your leisure,5,,"The flyer provides great views in all directions over the 30 - 40 minute cycle. This provides plenty of time to relax and frame your photos or just enjoy watching Singapore go by.
The air conditioned cabins are a perfect temperature for a comfortable ride and a bit of relief from the heat outside.
The gelati at the shop at the bottom is a delicious way to finish the experience in flavours of mango passion fruit or berry.",,,
,,Best panoramic elevated view of the Bayfront,5,,It was an especially lovely sight at night as the capsules have ac and moved very slowly offering us a careful view of every angle of the city and its night lights. It is said to be even higher than the London Eye so u definitely don't want to miss the ride which costs SGD33. Loads of fun shops and food in the area which is walking distance from the Promenade MRT. Personally recommend it as a relaxing stop for the night with your other half.,,,
,,A MUST in Singapore,5,,"Don't leave Singapore without visiting the Flyer. It`s a fantastic experience, specially at Night or dusk. A full rotation lasts about 30min.",,,
,,"UP,up and away!",5,,Safely enclosed in a capsule you are slowly taken 150m above Singapore and the views are magnificent. You can see parts of Malaysia and Indonesia on a clear day. It is well worth doing.,,,
,,So many better views in Singapore,1,,"Did this as a corporate group. In a city/state that has so many options for high-altitude viewing, this felt like the worst of them. Not only is it extremely slow, the views it gives isn't anything you can't see from other places like MBS or the hundreds of other bars boasting views.

If you don't mind viewing the same thing for 30 minutes in a car full of other people who are too busy taking selfies to even look around, go ahead. This would not be on my list of things to do if I was only in Singapore for a couple days.",,,
,,A must do,5,,So many of the attractions in Singapore were great value. Something of a surprise. The Flyer is no different. A great experience with views over the harbor and beyond. It is easy to get to and was the perfect stop off as we left the gardens.,,,
,,Good start for sightseeing in Singapore,5,,"The Flyer provides a very good overview of sightseeing in Singapore from the above. From the capsule, we can see Gardens by the Bay, the whole of Marina and the Marina Bay Sands. At the foot of it, there is the City Tours bus that tourist can buy the tickets for sightseeing by the bus.",,,
,,sunsets,4,,"beautiful views of all Singapore , I guess the best advice I can give is go for the sunsets .....and we enjoyed a good meal down in the food court afterwards",,,
,,First time thrills,4,,"It has been years since we had been to Singapore so the Flyer was a natrural choice for an experience. We did it on day one so as to also use the view to orientate ourselves. It worked and is recommended for that purpose. The view is yterrific. We were enticed to visit the gardens, Merlion Park, Fullerton, the science centre and more based on our spectacular views from the Flyer.

Go early so the cabin is not crowded. It takes a bit of practice to photograph through the windows but the results can be rewarding. The Flyer is so big it feels very safe. The gondolas are roomy, have seating and wonderful viewing advantages across the city, out to sea and lose in.

Well worth while as an experience and to get your bearings for more travel by foot.",,,
,,Fantastic views!,5,,Situated just off the bay and within walking distance of Marina Bay Sands we visited here to be able to get a great view over the bay. Works out around 拢16 per adult and takes approx 40 minutes for the wheel to run a full circuit. Fantastic photo opportunities and as the wheel runs slowly there is no rush to snap away with the camera. Worth a visit.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"The 'check-in' for the Singapore Flyer was very efficient and the staff were friendly. The pods are large and the glass was very clean, so great for taking pictures. The views are fantastic",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"The trip lasts around half an hour but is well worth it. The views over the bay and downtown are magical. I went at dusk so I enjoyed both day and night views- the best of both worlds. If you have a recent SIA boarding card you gap can get a small discount on the price, which helped make it feel better value for money.",,,
,,Skyline Scanning,5,,"Great way to start a short stay in this amazing city. This was our first attraction and provided us with both the ""lie of the land"" and spectacular views without any physical exertion! The flyer is on the sightseeing bus tours but is within easy walking distance from the city centre. Set in a small but beautiful garden, the flyer provides a slow, 360 degree panorama view of Singapore. Needless to say it is spotlessly clean and the staff are extremely polite. As it was quiet in December we had a ""pod"" to ourselves and as F1 Grand Prix fans an aerial view of the starting grid, pit lane etc>",,,
,,Great attraction,4,,"One of the highest ferris wheels in the world (165 m) giving you a fantastic view of the Bay area from one of its 28 air-conditioned capsules which are mounted outboard of the rim of the wheel structure, providing continuously unobstructed views. We had bad luck with the weather (when it rains in Singapore it pours) but after waiting for about an hour we did get some clear skies, went in and thoroughly enjoyed the view. The capsules give a safe feeling, so even my afraid-of-heights-wife survived the experience without panic attacks and sedation 鈽?
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,This is one of the biggest observatory wheel", even bigger then the London Eye. It gives you a fantastic view of the city," the ocean and also other neighboring countries are visible from their. Very comfortable place with closed cabin and hence you can enjoy without any fear. It is a must must visit thing.""",
,,Wonderful view but takes a loong time.,4,,"Such a slow but a memorable ride. We can see almost the whole Singapore from the highest point, But not only that the guide said that on clear sky days we can see the patronas tower in Malaysia as well. No need to worry about the skin. I guess they have used UV protection and a tint on the glasses so that we could have a comfortable ride. Nice memory but took kinda a loong time for the ride.",,,
,,Great way to see the city scape,5,,This is a must when visiting Singapore. I got the champagne experience for me and my wife and we were lucky enough to get the carriage to ourselves. The whole experience is amazing and you get views of one of the most amazing harbours in the world. I gave it five stars for our experience but if we went with others the experience would have got four stars. There private dinners too which look tops,,,
,,Excellent light view from Singapore Flyer,5,,"We have gone to Singapore flyer as it was a package together with hop on hop off bus Singapore. We were happy that we didn't miss this attraction to have overall view of Singapore. We went there around 6pm and we enjoyed the light view especially the beauty of Garden by The Bay.
Highly encourage if you buy package tickets together with other entrance attraction or hop on hop off bus, very worth it, if compared to you only buy single entrance ticket to Singapore Flyer.",,,
,,Breathtaking!,5,,Just do it! Amazing sights by day and even more beautiful by night. It as definately worth the 1/2 hour spent going around and admiring the view!,,,
,,Fantastic! Pay the extra for the VIP experience well worth it!,5,,"I absolutely adored this tour. We paid for the signature cocktail flight which was 62SGD (about 30 pounds) and it was worth every extra penny.

We were escorted from the lounge too a bar upstairs. The staff took photos of us and then we were able to skip the queues and head straight Into our own private capsule.

The drinks were delivered inside for us to drink during the flight which lasted approx 30 minutes. It has a stereo system you can hook your phone up to and play music of your choice.

The capsule moves slowly and the views were absolutely fantastic. Treated like a VIP and an experience I will never forget",,,
,,Check this off your Singapore bucket list.,5,,I love these wheels and always take advantage if the city I am visiting has one. This is well run with lots of fun shops and food in the area. Day or night or both. The technology is great.,,,
,,Best view in Singapore,5,,"Giant 300' tall Airconditioned ferris wheel type ride. You see the bay, hundreds of boats and a lovely garden and the best view of Singapore, all for around $30SD. Lovely walk along the Singapore River from the Novotel-Clarke Quay.",,,
,,What a view!,5,,"I loved my trip on the Flyer in Singapore. I'm not one for rides or heights but found this most enjoyable as you do a slow rotation to the top and down again. You hardly know you are moving and the views .......wow! We were lucky that we didn't have too many tourists in our cabin that day.
Another don't miss thing to do in Singapore.
Evidently it suppose to be amazing at sunset and if you have the $'s you can do a private dinner at sunset on there.",,,
,,Fantastic View...,5,,You can get a fantastic view of the city from the top of Singapore Flyer. I would recommend time around sunset to visit the same...,,,
,,Great view,5,,"Make sure you get full benefit of the view by going on a clear day. The flyer is in constant rotation, you don't even notice that it's moving. Large, all glass containers let you see in every direction, but I found out later that the windows are tinted, something you don't realize until you see the blue tint in all your photos.",,,
,,A ride of joy,5,,"Singapore Flyer in its initial days had loads of promotions running. We won in one of the promotion competitions, and we were given, two complete cycles of the ride, plus dinner for two, and that too in our own cabin with butler. Could this be better.

It was an awesome experience. The food was amazing, the butler was super sweet.

It is a recommended ride (I have been to the London Eye too) ;)",,,
,,Great views over the city and surrounding area,5,,My wife and i insisted on a carriage to ourselves and due to it being pretty quite we were obliged. We enjoyed the experience perhaps more than if we were in a carriage with others as we got to experience it together in private. Great views over a great city...,,,
,,Fun experience,5,,"We did the Flyer at night and timed it so we could see the nightly light show. We were able to see enough of the show to satisfy us. Ride was pleasant and provided a good view of the city. It takes 30 minutes to complete the ride, going slow so you don't even know you're moving. Comfortable enclosed capsules allowing you to move about so you can get good pictures. Just an enjoyable experience.",,,
,,High flyer,5,,"Tis is a really tall big wheel, amazing views right over the start/finish of the Singapore GP track. We went in the day but I bet the night views are tremendous.",,,
,,Don't miss it!,5,,"Our group of loved the experience of seeing All Singapore. Our guide said it used to have big lines, but not anymore because many prefer to go to Marina Bay Sands. We were staying at the Sands and the view of flyer was even better!!",,,
,,Stunning views,4,,"We had free tickets for the flyer with our bus tour. The hop on hop off bus drops you right at the flyer. I'm not a great fan of heights but i enjoyed it. The whole circuit takes about 30 mins and goes very slowly that you don't feel like you are moving. There was only 4 of us in the carriage and plenty of room to take pics at various points. The views over the city are awesome and on a clear day you can see over to Malaysia.

Defo worth a visit and great way to see some of the landmarks of Singapore.",,,
,,A great experience,5,,"We went on the Flyer around 17.00 .it was empty we were able to walk right on.
Amazing sights and we were able to get some really good pictures.The light was just beginning to fade ,I think if it got any darker or you went up at night photos wouldn't be great as the flash bounces back off of the glass.
Well worth a visit, our experience was all the better as we did not have to queue.",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"Had a great trip on the Singapore Flyer, the views are superb and the capsules are excellent so you can see all around. The gift shop was also very good with lovely souvenirs at reasonable prices. Definitely recommend a trip.",,,
,,This is just Awesome!!!!!,5,,"If when you visit Singapore you really must visit this building well you will be shocked, and wonder where you have been all this time.
At night this spectacular scene can be seen from miles and miles away, the Singaporean people should be proud of the Government for building such an attraction",,,
,,Offers Really Great Views of Singapore,4,,"If you're afraid of heights, this is the time to conquer it as this attraction really offers spectacular views of Singapore. Didn't feel any motion sickness when I was on this since it moved slow and made me feel safe. I think it took approximately 30-45minutes to complete 1 cycle. The capsule we were on was ventilated well and clean. You also have the option of buying a souvenir photo if you wanted to. Staff were really friendly and explained to us what we should expect.",,,
,,Fabulous view of Singapore waterfront,4,,"We had some time on our hands and wanted to escape the daily downpours - what better way than to jump on the Flyer! Unfortunately, the skies cleared but what a view! The entire ride lasts about 35 minutes and rotates slow enough so that you can get a pretty good view of everything. Cabins have seats and are air-conditioned. Quite comfortable. Nothing much to do in the area after so we walked to the Helix and hiked over to the Marina Bay Sands to check out their casino (a whole other story/adventure!).",,,
,,Gorgeous view,4,,"You get a superb views of parts of singapore such as Kallang stadium, Gardens by the bay, the nearby CBD area and even glimpses of hometowns. We went in the afternoon bout 32m so it was bright and sunny. For a much more incredible view would suggest to go in the early morning or late evening towards night time. The nearest mrt station is Promenade and it's about a 15 - 20 min walking distance. There's halal fast food eatery such as Popeye's and Ya Kun kaya toast which would make a nice breakfast. Most importantly and obvious point of all, don't forget your cameras for the photo taking",,,
,,Fantastic View,4,,"The family loved the time on the Flyer. The views were spectacular and overed a gres-at overview of the cities layout and features. The time of the trip was perfect, the kids were captivated the whole way. Well worth doing",,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"The Singapore Flyers capsules are spacious to allow a wonderful views of Singapore and mostly glass to allow excellent videos, photos etc to be taken..They are immaculately clean and security checks are under taken before boarding and after departing capsules are searched after each ride which takes about 30mins to complete the circle.",,,
,,"Great Views, But . . .",4,,"The Singapore Flyer provided a nice 陆-half hour break from the heat with great aerial views. The tinted windows are a hindrance to having crystal clear photos, unless knowledge of filters and post production photo editing can get you around that obstacle. The Flyer was chosen over Marina Bay Skypark because a tripod could be used and because the Marina Bay Towers could be photographed from the wheel. Marina Bay does not allow camera tripods. The compartment is roomy and provides 360掳 views.",,,
,,Marina Bay at yr feet.,5,,"Singapore Flyer, the giant wheel ,having 28 capsules completing one circle in 28 minutes has many surprises like great height, fantastic view of the Mariana Bay, Anchored Ships ,boats , Gardens, Hotels and many other High rise buildings.A view which can multiply manifold on any clear night. Each capsule has a walk through door on both sides, the movement being very slow, its not difficult to hop in and out. There are attendants on both sides to help you board and alight. Two members of our party were having phobia of height, do not go near the glass panes or door were their constant advise and we were telling them all the times to look at this or that. At some moments you feel as if the Giant Wheel has stopped, which actually is moving constantly.
Many might feel the cost of ticket quite expensive when converted in their own currencies, but
when you look at the facilities, safety measures , location and maintenance these are worth it. Senior Citizens, Groups are offered good rebates.
A must see attraction.",,,
,,Nothing great,3,,"If you have been in one of such flyers before in other places I would recommend that you skip this one and instead do something which you have not done before (Eg - There is a Boeing Flight Simulator in the same building) or visit a new place. There is no unique experience as such. The flyer moves really very very slow so you won't even notice that its moving. Once you are up you get to see the sea side and rest of the Singapore from a height but that you could do from Marina Sans Bay as well. We took discounted tickets from a travel agent (www.seawheel.com.sg) which allowed us to goto the flyer anytime of the day, I guess it costed SGD 20",,,
,,Great view of the city.,5,,"If you want to see Singapore attractions and orientate yourself to the city this is ideal. The Marina Sands Hotel, the Flower Dome, the harbour are all close by. Great to take photographs. Shops and bars around the base mean there is somewhere to bolt if the heavens open.",,,
,,What a View,5,,"This was an amazing experience to see the entire city and surrounds and it was good value for money. Wasn't overly impressed with the walk through to the wheel. We stopped to look at the information station about the well and its statistics but for whatever reason they didn't work. Don't particularly like the photo station with the green wall, but that's me but would be good for kids.",,,
,,even better than the London Eye,5,,"two in our party were apprehensive due to the heights, BUT.. no worries, as the wheels went so slow that you hardly feel you are travelling at all. Slick operation, good clean capsules, and pretty amazing views. great experience- if you have bought the Singapore S $89 special sightseeing package -it's inc.",,,
,,Amazing Experience,3,,"This is a very amazing experience to watch entire city from so high. Though the flyer moves very slow, we can experience something enjoying views at various stages. This was my second experience in the flyer. At my first experience in 2009, there was commentry running at each stage explaining the locations and places which can be seen from the particular angle. I think this system was now discontinued.",,,
,,Slowly up and over!,4,,"This is the first large wheel that I have been on, well worth it. We were identified as seniors when about to pay and offered a good discount. The wheel takes about 30 minutes to complete its circle and you have plenty of time to see fabulous views of Singapore. The walk way through to the wheel we found a bit trite, but children would probably enjoy it.",,,
,,Choose a good timing,4,,We chooser a good timing close to sunset and had view of light and night. Was a nice ride around to give a view of Singapore's skyline. My guest loved it!,,,
,,Great view of Singapore,4,,"We purchased the Singapore pass which gave us tickets to the flyer, duck tour and 48 hours on the hop on hop bus which we thought was good value. The flyer gave you great views of Singapore and the attractions surrounding the flyer. A nice smooth ride and spacious cabin. Would recommend!",,,
,,Great Experience,5,,"This was a great experience - I had booked my ticket in advance and got there just before it opened. My welcome into the tour was very friendly - and although most of the shops were shut, I think it was a good time to go. I managed to get a capsule to myself which was brilliant and the views were breathtaking - a really great 30 mins spent and I was in awe for the whole rotation.

Absolutely highly recommended and worth a trip!",,,
,,Fun ride,4,,"A very nice way to see the city at night. Very slow moving, so it's possible to to sharp photos of the city lights.",,,
,,Wow!,5,,Amazing 1/2 hour Ferris wheel ride overlooking Singapore. So much to see from above. And the slow pace of the gondolas makes taking pictures a breeze. I thought I would be frightened but it was not at all scary!,,,
,,Go for the view,4,,The view from the flyer of the magnificient skyline is superb.Its roughly a 30 to 40 min ride & quite informative with the on board tour guide. Its quite smooth & absolutely safe.,,,
,,This is a must,4,,The Singapore Flyer should be on your To Do list. Excellent views and the timing of the rotation is perfect. You get time to see everything but it's not so long you get bored.,,,
,,Amazing view,5,,"the most amazing thing to do in Singapore. from someone afraid of heights, I loved this. moving so slowly you barely notice. the views are amazing. Go early to avoid lines.

The slow rotation of the enclosed cars on this huge Ferris Wheel offer great views of the harbor, skyline, Marina Bay Sands, and Gardens by the Bay. The large pods unfortunately fit a fairly large group, so you may be sharing with loud children. The windows on the pods also make night photography a bit difficult as they tend to be a bit finger print covered. Still, a great way to see the city from on high.",,,
,,very informative,4,,great view of Sentosa Island and others around. very informative with the on board virtual tour guide like of the history of Singapore.,,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,This is one of the safest flyer that you will come across in the world. The flyer moves so smoothly that even a person who is afraid of heights can also do it easily. When you sit in the flyer you don't feel the movement and you get engrossed in the beautiful views of singapore city and it's skyline. The ride takes only thirty minutes.,,,
,,Great Effort to attract Tourists... But...,2,,"I think the government did a good job in trying to attract tourists and build things to make Singapore iconic... but the Singapore Flyer I must say is really not a great success, sad to say.

The skyline has indeed improved and made more interesting... but to sit inside the flyer for about 45 minutes is really not my cup of tea. Maybe someone else's...

Guess to a tourist might have a different perspective... at least they have to have a look right? But for the locals... it is really not a great attraction... though maybe you have to go maybe once in a lifetime... before it closes for good.",,,
,,Lynn & Stephen Tour 2014,3,,Not all that exciting esp. with a car full of ill-mannered children. Bang for the buck - wouldn't do it again. We did do it during the day and perhaps it is a better experience at night.,,,
,,Awesome View of Singapore,5,,"i must say that when you go to this place security and safety is their priority so you will really feel comfortable while taking the ride.

the ride is about 30 minutes... the scenic view of the west, east and central singapore will keep you entertained for the whole ride",,,
,,Lovely Views,5,,"We did the 30 minute ride. I am scared of heights, so was a little nervous at first. At all times I felt safe, the capsule is spacious, we were the only people in there. Beautiful views, the ride is slow, so you hardly feel like you are moving.",,,
,,Nice way to spend a few hours,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is very beautiful, and stands out itself as a landmark in Singapore. Riding the Flyer gives you views out over the city as well as Marina Bay Sands - although it's at an angle perhaps not great for photos. But still, it's an enjoyable ride - just try to pick times where the queues aren't too long...",,,
,,good views,5,,"this is a half an hour ride in a glass pod on a wheel, the pods hold about 12 people. It gives fantastic views of the city 360 degrees and well worth a birds eye view!",,,
,,nice flyer but ticket quite expensive,5,,"i really have to said that the view from the flyer very very nice...we go at the night so we can view a quite romantic view from upstairs.but the ticket will quite expensive but really worth it.besides,at the ground have a famous old stall that have many variety of sg local food u can try.",,,
,,OK but there are better views of the city to be had.,4,,Everything comes at a price in Singapore and the flyer is no exception.....$33.00pp. Yes you get some good views of Singapore but my preference would be to visit One Raffles Place ~ Altitude Bar where at least a complimentry drink is provided as part of the entrance fee.,,,
,,Great view of Singapore for the first timer,5,,"I am first timer tourist of Singapore and adding Singapore Flyer on my list is such a great choice. i visit Singapore Flyer on the evening and the view is so fantastic. You can see everything from the top, and the duration of the ride is great.",,,
,,Taken For A Spin,4,,"Nice smooth ride with great views of Singapore , catch bus or MRT to the flyer , shops and restaurants on site.",,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Amazing view, bit pricy but we bought combination tickets to the Ferris Wheel and the Duck Boat. Really cool and a beauty to see. Not recommended for people afraid of heights.",,,
,,Good for Photography,4,,This is a observatory and not to be confused with a amusement ride. It takes around 30-35 mins for a single round and is good for taking photographs when reached on the top.,,,
,,The way to do it!,5,,"We were only in Singapore for about 6 hours on a Cruise Ship stopover and decided we would Ride the Flyer. There were not too many probably due to the particular day, but were were shown great courtesy. The Capsules hold 40 people and we shared it with four others, so we could move around at will. A great way to see much of this beautiful island.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"If you go on the flyer you see more then some other obsevation decks. it is airconditioned and you are given a map so you can pinpoint where you are. A little expensive but everything in Singapore in expensive. You can do tours that take you here, hop on hop off bus and there is a Duck tour that looks great, that includes the Flyer in the tour. It was a good overview and you can pinpoint where you walk to from here. MRT rail system is great for getting to all places of interest and it is so, so easy to use.",,,
,,A great experience with magnificent views.,5,,We are both in our 70's and it was a great experience to go up on the flyer and to see such magnificent views of Singapore. It made us really appreciate why we stay over on our trips to Perth every two years. The views of the Gardens by the Bay made us also go there on this stopover. The Seniors fare was appreciated.,,,
,,spin me right round,4,,"It's not too expensive as far as tourist things are concerned, SGD30 will give you an hour's trip round.. Try to go whent he sun is setting on a clear day- that way you'll get both views of the harbour and neighbouring countries, as well as the magnificent lights of Marina Bay!",,,
,,It's good to take picture from here,5,,I like it as you get to see Singapore from different view than on top of most building. Down stair also has a lot of old famous restaurants that they move here.,,,
,,Best views of Singapore!,5,,"We spent 3 days in a Singapore and the Flyer was the first we did, Best views in Singapore by a long way, you would be crazy not to spend the little money it is to go up and see one of the most beautiful cities in the world.

Highly recommend.",,,
,,Uninterrupted View,5,,No better way to get a 360 degree view of Singapore. If you go just on dusk you get to see Singapore before the lights come on and then by the time you get to the top and coming down the night lights give another spectacular sight. The ride is so smooth you hardly feel like you are moving and everyone gets a great view no matter where you are standing inside. We had vouchers from our Stop Over Holiday.,,,
,,Maybe the best Ferris wheel in the world.,4,,"Very good and smooth ride. The view of the city is uncanny, especially at night. The Singapore flyer used to be the tallest Ferris wheel in the world (it was surpassed by the high roller in Las Vegas), so I would recommend it for those afraid of heights. If it's hot (and it's always hot in Singapore), you should check the ice cream parlor next to the Ferris wheel.",,,
,,awesome,4,,"How much better can you feel when your on top of the world. We went night time, and the view is breathtaking. The only thing we found was, you had to wait a while for a taxi.",,,
,,It's very high,5,,"This is my first time to take the wheel and i'm really afraid of height but it's very good for those who afraid of height and speed as the movements is in steady speeds, you don't even feel that you already in the top of the world... You can see nice views of Singapore....",,,
,,mpg1970,5,,"huhh so good and really enjoyed the ride, you see the Singapore at a glance , my little kiddo loved it too",,,
,,Wonderful,5,,"As a family , we went on this giant wheel and were in for a pleasant surprise. Almost half an hour worth the money and especially during the sunset you feel like you are on top of the world and some amazing visuals awaits you.
Brilliant concept and wow feeling!",,,
,,Great Ride,5,,"WE had a great time on the flyer, nice smooth ride and the view is worth seeing....We had been on it a few years ago but we still enjoyed it as much this time",,,
,,A Big Wheel,5,,"We took a taxi to the Flyer where we were admitted with a senior citizens discount. It was very well worthwhile. The ride itself is great and the entry to it very interested and filled with exhibits. The wheel provides magnificent views of Singapore, If you have the right cabin mates (as we did, a group from Taiwan) they really can make the trip on the flyer fun. We joked and took pictures with each other and thoroughly enjoyed the time we spent.",,,
,,A one time trip,3,,"Singapore flyer is one of the iconic architecture in Singapore. The best time to get on this flight is during the evening time where the sun is not so hot and if you wanna view the beautiful lightings of singapore, go during the night. This flight is about 30mims a round. It goes very slow so it is sufficient to take lots of photos. But I felt that there are quite a lot of places to view singapore skyline, so personally I would only visit the singapore flyer once as an experience only.",,,
,,well worth it,5,,"well worth a visit to the flyer, great views across Singapore on a clear day of the marina and the gardens and looking back over the city. We took the MRT to Marina Bay Sands and then walked, it bit of an effort in the heat but a good way to see the marina, the gardens and finish at the flyer.",,,
,,Pleasant experience,4,,"There was no line-up, and so very easy to get on/off. We went on a misty/light rain day, and so the view was not the best, but still a very pleasant way to have a good view of the city. The price was expensive though.",,,
,,Great way to see the city!,4,,"This was a lot of fun, and the views were stunning! Quite romantic--except for the other people in the little car. I recommend a trip. Take your camera! You can also have dinner there. Look into that!",,,
,,Good view on top of the Flyer,4,,"It's a rainy afternoon when visit the flyer. Lucky because not so many visitors. It's another view to experience Marina Bay, the hotel, Garden by the Bay and F1 area. The 30 mins inside the flyer was an enjoyable experience.",,,
,,Best View of Singapore,5,,"A true Singapore must if you want to get the 'big picture' on how big the city is, but also to get a glimpse of the sky line, the marina, harbor, etc. One round takes around 30 minutes, it moves so slow that you have ample time to take pictures or just to sit down and to enjoy the view",,,
,,Not a 'Must Go' Attraction.,3,,"The structure is amazing! Something similar to The Eye in London. with Marina Bay Sands just around the corner and being able to enjoy the same view longer than 30mins, it is sure not worth the amount paid.",,,
,,Singapore Skyline in 30 minutes,5,,"The island of Singapore has always been an amazing country. While its size is small and with a population of a mere 5M it has progress beyond its Asian neighbors and has continued to be a leader in technology, finance, education and even in engineering marvels. For the ordinary tourists like the six of us Filipinos, a ride in the Singapore flyer is truly an unforgettable experience. Each cable car sits 8 people and the seats face in both directions. Like a giant ferris wheel the flyer rotates on its axis. Careful...the guide said ""do not stand...the cable car needs balance and movement inside is never encourage since it will contribute to tilting movements. For those afraid of heights, you can probably go to the Marina Sands and pay the observatory fee instead of riding the Singapore flyer. One can see the grounds below and you will feel almost touching the clouds. For us adventure lovers, we got the thrill of our lives seeing the skyscrapers of Singapore...the Marina Sands exotically designed buildings and we have that queasy feeling in the pit of our stomach. ...So...this is how it feels to be on top.....you see a whole new world beneath you.",,,
,,the place you should visit,5,,"it is one of the place that you should visit when go to Singapore. you can see the whole singapore from the top, the view is amazing especially at night. for cheaper ticket you can try to search it online for promotion. if you take your children, i suggest you take a taxi because it is quite far from the nearest MRT station about 10 minutes walking.",,,
,,Singapore Sling on the Flyer,4,,"Booked the ride with where you got a Singapore Sling Cocktail in our cabin. Apart from the great view at night, this was a real Singapore sling that was served, made from scratch and tasted total different (a lot better) than the Sinapore Sling at Raffles.",,,
,,Second thing to do,5,,"Second? Well, the first thing is to get a MRT card so you can get there on the excellent and efficient underground. The Flyer is simply magnificent - it takes half an hour to complete the circle, and from your gondola you will appreciate the basic geography of Singapore - don't forget to pick up a map when you buy the ticket. It does get very busy at peak times, so pick the time carefully.",,,
,,One of those things you kind of have to do! :),4,,"Yes, it's a big wheel. Yes, it's pretty much the same as the London Eye (same size, as it happens, but because this is Singapore, they placed it on a raised platform to make it taller than the London Eye!).

It is an expensive treat, but the views over Marina Bay are spectacular.",,,
,,Great experience!,5,,"A lovely way to see the city - panoramic views over the bay, over the city - great views of the Sands hotel too.",,,
,,Great Views!,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is quite reminiscent of the London Eye - just different views. The Flyer experience allows one to get their bearings in Singapore - I did it on my first day which was definitely worth the experience for the orientation. Also, the area around the Flyer makes the whole experience a worthwhile one - lots of other activities to participate it. Eventhough the ride on the flyer i just 30 minutes, plan for 2 hours - as there really is lots to do. Just be sure to have your dollars/credit card ready to go!",,,
,,Good one hour view,4,,"Nothing truly spectacular, a good fun ride if you have never done it. Views at night are quite nice if you like city scapes. Day time views seemed a bit underwhelming.",,,
,,Slow ride offering pretty views,4,,"Went with my family after dark to flyer. Getting in and out can feel tricky since the cabs never stop. They are moving just so slowly that u r expected to step in and out of the moving cabin. Which is surprising but hardly tough. The well lit city was fun to look at from the vantage points offered by the flyer. Total ride might have been 20mins as you go around once. The super slow speed did get a tad boring, especially for my 4 year old. The blue light in the cabin made for interesting psychedelic pictures inside too. Our phones caught some great pics of Singapore from flyer.
Overall pricey but unique.",,,
,,A must on your visit to Singapore,5,,"fantastic views over the city and Coast. On the day we visited there were not too many people. We shared a cabin with about 6 other travellers. Very comfortable with enough seating for all of us, and plenty of room to move around. Took heaps of photos.",,,
,,Obviously u have to.,4,,"The title sums it up.the night view is much better than the day(according to ones own personal preference).you'll be done in 30 minutes.the cabin/capsule felt bigger and much better than the London wheel to me.on the one side we get the business district on the other the port/harbour mouth area, botanic gardens and parks.its currently the highest ferris wheel I believe.",,,
,,Fantastic!,5,,"Went on the flyer on our first day in Singapore, yesterday - brilliant
We went after a thunderstorm, in the evening.so the air was really clear.
No queues at 8pm, when we got there, so straight on and enjoy the ride! Only 6 other people in our pod, so plenty of space to move around.
Brilliant views of the Singapore skyline.
We really enjoyed our trip.
We got many brilliant photos, just leave your 'flash' switched off to stop it bouncing off the glass and hold camera / phone steady against the pod rails for excellent results!
Although it appears to be moving quite slowly, when it's time to get off, care must be taken as you've got to be quick - it doesn't stop.
All in all a 'must do' when in Singapore",,,
,,Cabin in the Sky,5,,"Not too far a walk from City Center, the Flyer is an enormous Ferris Wheel, bigger than London's ""Eye"". The half-hour ride slowly rotates one through views of the city and surroundings from east to west, spectacular. We did the ride late afternoon and lights were just beginning to come on in the city, so it must be splendid at night. We got the senior fare on line, but waiting in line didn't seem to be a problem, as we had our Cabin in the Sky"" all to ourselves.",,,
,,SUPERB EXPERIENCE,5,,"i have experienced the thrill of sitting in the singapore thrice till date.
It shows the beauty of singapore from aerial view. beside this it is very nice to see the iconic hotel marina bay sand as well as merlion from the capsule. the scentic beauty of the bay of sea can be observed from the flyer. beside this what i like most about the flyer is they have made available all the information of singapore as well as how the flyer is made is kept there before entering the flyer.
you can pay around 20 singapore dollar and take six pictures of your with singapore flyer.",,,
,,Fabulous views,4,,"It's about $30 for 30 minutes, maybe a little expensive but the views are fantastic, obviously better to go on a clear day, but would still be enjoyable. The GP circuit is right next to the ride, so you can see part of the race track as you go round. The hawker food stalls at the bottom of the flyer are brilliant, very inexpensive and the locals seem to meet there for lunch which is a good indicator. We had 2 delicious chicken dishes with rice for $10!",,,
,,Slow moving observation wheel,3,,"The view provided by this giant observation wheel includes financial centre, business district and harbbour front. It moves very slowly with ample opportunity to refer to map and take pictures. I did not feel so great considering the hype created around it.",,,
,,Keep it for the last..........,4,,"It's just in front of Promenade station which you can reach via both Downtown line and circle line.
Fare is around SGD 33 per person.
If you go there on the last day of your visit you can see all the attractions you visited from a bird鈥檚 eye view. Marina Bay & Gardens by the Bay are the most closest.",,,
,,Fireworks,3,,"We were fortunate to see the fireworks during The F1 race from the top of the flyer. However, it really is not worth the price. The view is beautiful at night and it can be hazy in the day(October- November). There are other places where views in Singapore are more impressive. Sands hotel roof park, Swissotel The Stamford.",,,
,,Night time view,5,,"We went on the flyer this evening, at about 8pm, we didn't book, but went after a thunderstorm had passed over.
Conditions were perfect and the views were stunning!
No queue at all, we shared our car with 6 other people, so we had plenty of space in our pod.
Getting on and off could be a worry for the less mobile as although it appears to be moving really slowly, when your getting in or out you have to be quick.
We loved the experience and recommend it to visitors of Singapore.
Turn off your cameras flash and steady it on the railing and you'll get some awesome cityscapes of Singapore by night.",,,
,,Well Worth It,5,,We went on the Singapore Flyer just before sunset. It was a great time as you could take in all the sights in the daylight and then enjoy the lights of Singapore. The capsules fit quite a few people in them and although there was another group with our group there was plenty of room to move about to take in all the sights. Would probably do it again,,,
,,Dusk on flyer,5,,"I decided late one afternoon to jump on the flyer. It was enchanting, ride is 30 mins & I started the ride in daylight, finishing on dark. Luved the lights of Singapore. The ride I found was great at this time of day., very modern, clean & the biggest Ferris wheel on earth. Great view, enjoyed it very much. Very spacious & it holds up to 8 people easily

Try to go up in dusk.",,,
,,It's just for the novelty of it!,3,,"Actually, nothing much to do, once you get into the capsule car. The experience lasts about 30 minutes. The capsule rises slowly but steadily, and you get to see an aerial view of Singapore and beyond.

Not very exciting. And it depends on who is in the capsule car with you. Each car can take in about 20 or more passengers. Best to go when it's not crowded, so you get to be in the capsule car with your loved ones only.",,,
,,Star Cruise with Singapore City Tour,5,,"One of the finest experiences we had during our recent trip to Singapore and also our stay in the Star Cruise Gemini for two nights.. It was indeed a very enjoyable trip with loads of entertainment aboard the cruise.. Singapore City itself is an amazing city especially the Flyer.. It was a beautiful experience watching the entire city of Singapore from the Flyer.. It was raining in October and the weather was awesome.. A must see for all those who have not visited Singapore ..We were a big group escorted by Kesari Tours and it was indeed a very memorable tour for us.. The arrangements made by Kesari Tours was outstanding especially our tour guides Chetan and Irene who were so warm, courteous, friendly and ever ready to help.. Three Cheers !!!!!!",,,
,,Good but not great,3,,"Night view is great, cleanliness and toilets in the vicinity are not up to the standard comparing to other must see attractions in Singapore. The compulsory souvenir photo taking session before boarding is terrible, they shouldn't ask the every group of visitors pose unless it is free of charge. They should have known that not everyone is interested to pose for it, it should be optional. Overall is good.",,,
,,"Splendid View During the Day, Shall Go for the Night View in Future",5,,"Besides the Lovely Views, you get to enjoy the favourite food of Singaporeans in a very real Singapore in the 1950-1970s. WOW!

It really blew me off my feet when I saw the old exhibits that were there - there is ice-ball, kachang putei in the old settings. Just marvellous and oh yes, the famous songs of the yester-years.

Enjoy.

,,Worth a visit,5,,On a clear day this is a must-visit attraction for visitors to Singapore. It isn't just the wheel itself but also the informative and interactive displays on the way in to it. Flyer takes about 30 minutes to get right round and affords excellent views of the city and harbour.,,,
,,OK but not the London Flyer,2,,A reasonable experience but you have to realize a view of a mainly modern city. Good if you have never been to Singapore. I didn't hear any commentary which would have helped to point out various areas of interest.,,,
,,not worth the hype,3,,More so if you've seen the London Eye or some such attraction in any other city of the world. its a little expensive and there is always a queue because it (unfortunately so) is on the itinerary of all tourists. I'd give it a miss because its just not worth the hype.,,,
,,Best view of Singapore,4,,One can get the whole view of Singapore on top of this wheel. A total of half an hour ride. best enjoyed in the evenings!,,,
,,Good place to start,4,,"If you have no idea to go to singapore, try to go to this place first, so you can see what is where and have a good pic of singapore from above. this giant wheel can help you to see 360 its surrounding from the same height of the tip of the Marina Bay Sand hotels near by.. To go by MRT, go to Promenade Station and out in Rafles Ave (the closest gate), the go with 5 minutes walk..",,,
,,A must visit,5,,"This was brilliant and a must the views are breath taking, it does make you feel a bit odd when you get to the highest point of the wheel and you don't want to stand next to the glass, it was very funny watching everyone else doing the same thing. A tip for you 5.30pm ish is a good time, BUT you have to watch for the heat smog we went at lunch time as we were advised not to do that time due to this.",,,
,,Wow,5,,"Yes its the best thing in Singapore where you can see entire Singapore. I visited twice in this place one in the day time and one in the night time, its total half an hour ride. But i feel evening time is the best to visit this place. Once you reach top you will find the most amazing place.",,,
,,Boring,1,,"Gotten a student discount on the tickets but still wasn't worth going. Half an hour in the flyer, there wasn't even any audio guide telling you about Singapore. It was just... Looking into the distance for half an hour...",,,
,,Nice view,4,,We enjoyed the slow pace and the company in our capsule. We went early and there was quite the line when we disembarked. We walked right on board when we arrived.,,,
,,Awesome views.,4,,Great observation wheel and definitely worth a visit. The views of Singapore are spectacular with the bay area and Marina Bay Sands prominent. Best tip is to go first thing in the morning and you will not have to wait in any lines. My wife and I missed the crazy lines by attending early.,,,
,,Boring,3,,"view is good but its get boring after 5-10 mins. There is option to take dinner or lunch in the flyer but i find it very expensive. well if you have time in Singapore then go for it, but if you are on short visit then there are better things to do in Singapore.",,,
,,AWESOME!!!,5,,Booked the Singapore Sling flight. Car to your self and a drink to absorb the fantastic views!! All round worth every penny. photos of the city and the harbour in every direction. No queues like London. Situated right above the pit area for the F1 grand prix. So different in daylight.,,,
,,On top of the world,5,,"We were fortunate to go on the flyer at dusk so we went up in daylight and came down in the dark.. This was perfect as we got to see the best of both. At the highest point you are 142 stories high. The capsules can hold 28 people but there were only 4 in ours, and some were empty. This was an amazing way to see the whole of singapore.",,,
,,Wheely good fun,5,,Awesome observation wheel. Formerly the worlds largest at 165m in height. Great views of SG and surrounding buildings.,,,
,,Panaromic,4,,I was impressed the way everything was organized right from boarding to alighting. it takes about 30-45 minutes and gives a picturesque view of the city. My advice is go here instead of marina sky deck,,,
,,Fly at night,4,,"As Singapore is often a little hazy, I would recommend a night ""flight"" as the lights look spectacular. If you time your visit to co-ordinate with the super tree light show at the Gardens by the Bay you will have a great view of this as well.",,,
,,Cool Views,4,,"Its a pretty cool attraction if you are a tourist. You get pretty amazing views from that altitude of the entire city. Each pod can probably seat about 15 people and they provide a double bench in the middle to seat customers, but that's it. Also, the Flyer does not stop, so you need to walk in and out while the pod is moving.",,,
,,Must Do,5,,"First buy your tickets at the flyer as we found that there is a pension discount, it was my partners birthday coming up & she wanted to go on the biggest Flyer in the world so we did during the day, it was excellent so much to see & its so quite & steady, we loved it heaps.",,,
,,Meal on Wheel,5,,We booked the steak dinner on the Flyer. Was the highlight of our time in Singapore. Timing was wonderful as on the first rotation we saw the city at twilight and on the second rotation in full dark. The food was excellent too. The price was very good too considering the food prices in Singapore anyway.,,,
,,Awesome view,5,,"Well worth a visit, excellent views day & night, a little expensive but worth the money, option to have a photo but not sure at what cost, approx half hr so gives you chance to take everything in, there was some audio sound going on but you couldn't hear it so no idea if it was a guide. Cost $33 singapore dollars each",,,
,,WOWWW,5,,"It maybe termed expensive,but then it should be..Such is the experience from start till the end If you can splurge a little more,go for a champagne package All in all,A SUPERB EXPERIENCE",,,
,,panoramic view,4,,i went there with family and friends and it was enjoyable...at night you get superb views of the bay and if you have good enough camera then you can click amazing pictures...it moves at a very slow speed at takes around 30 mins to complete the entire circle..you can also get your pic clicked while boarding the flyer..,,,
,,Great Experiences...,5,,It was a great place to see the beauty of Singapore city from the top. So exciting and memorable experiences.,,,
,,Beautiful views!,5,,"Yes. It is the highest flyer in the world and it works for half and hour every turn. Therefore, we could see the whole picture of the city. Nighttime is the best for this activity.

It is quite costly every turn, around SGD $30+ per person. However, it is worth for your experience.

Also, some flyers tend to go fast but it is not applied for Singapore flyer :) I love this!",,,
,,the view!,5,,"It is never a bad idea to ride a ferris wheel that allows you to get a top view of a charming city like Singapore. Very safe for people who have fear of heights and those who tend to get dizzy easily. It is a calm, slow ride that is perfect for sightseeing, picture-taking, or just plain relaxing. Not a cheap experience but what you pay for is money well spent.",,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"We visited the Singapore flyer just as the sun was going down. The air conditioned cabin was large and very comfortable and shared with about 10 other people but plenty of room to move around and take photos. Seating was available in the middle of the cabin so you could sit or stand for the 30 minute experience. If you are scared of heights, as the wheel moves so slowly, you may well be ok and not adversely impacted. The views were magnificent in all directions, and at this time of the evening, the lights across Singapore and the marina were truly amazing. We enjoyed every minute of this experience and would highly recommend this to any visitor. Locals advised that during the day, the heat of the sun on the cabins can make them a little uncomfortable, but I can't speak from experience. Pick a day or evening when the sky is fairly clear and and not hazy. If you are staying at the marina at all this is within easy walking distance, and on site you will also find a number of local cheap eateries on the city side as well as a couple of cafe's and restaurants on the marina side. Enjoy!",,,
,,"Be a Cheesy Tourist, it's Worth It.",4,,"The Singapore Flyer is a typical tourist trap, expensive, cheesy green screen toursit pics on the way up (pick a good pose!) and lots of annoying screaming kids and foreigners bumping into you and taking millions of pictures as fast as they can that you know they will never look at in their lifetime.

With that being said, we were tourists and it was fun. You get in the big capsul with about 20 other people, so secure your viewing area and stay put! Gotta stake out your space and box out the little kids. We went at night and it was wonderful to see the city skyline and gardens by the bay from that height. We ended up purchasing our cheesy tourist green screen picture with us kissing and fireworks exploding in the background.",,,
,,spectacular view and worth visiting,5,,"Initially we were thinking of skipping the Singapore flyer but when we went for the Flight Simulator experience we were tempted to ride in the flyer. It is a 30 min ride. It was not much crowded.
It is an observatory wheel and not a amusement park wheel so obviously it is slow. Of course there is no excitement of speed like the amusement park wheel as it is anyways not meant for that. The entire view of the Marina Bay and the skyline from the capsule is spectacular and worth visiting. This gives you view of nature mingled with a modern city. One thing disappointed us that there was no 鈥榓udio guide鈥?about the view. We had heard that you can see Bintan / Batam Island of Indonesia from the highest point. As we were going to Bintan soon after our Singapore holidays, I wanted to show my Son where we are going .May be it was in sight but we could not recognize it. Same is the case of F1 track .We took many pictures from the flyer and later came to know that one of the photo is of the F1 track.
In case of bad weather the flyer is closed down. The flyer guests can wait in the 鈥榝lyers guest service Lounge鈥?till it starts. We dint know this as no one from the staff mentioned this. Anyways we had a good time walking around until it started again.",,,
,,"In a word .....""WOW""",5,,"Highly recommend the ""Champagne Night Flight"". My hubby and I were very lucky, we had the whole pod to ourselves....we took the 8pm flight on a Monday night. Which was my birthday. What a surprise when a happy birthday song came over the music systems. My husband did not organise this.. So we don't know how this came about. By paying more for the flight... No waiting in line...the pods hold about 20 people. But all the pods we notice where not full...
The views at night are wonderful. Singapore, is very decorative at night with coloured lighting...Singapore is not a boring city. The staff are very polite and friendly. For those that have height issues like my husband, he found to his surprise that because of the shape of the rounded domes of the pod, he felt no anxiety associated with heights, as he does with balconies. Lots of different eateries, similar to the hawkers at the markets, but nowhere near as busy...the only little disappointment was no photo of us was taken by the staff.... But we certainly took loads of videos of our own from the pod...",,,
,,Birds eye view of Singapore,4,,"As I mentioned earlier, Singaporeans are good in man made attractions, they exactly know how to attract people, SG flyer is also an one of the finest tourist spot ( I would say finest as it has been built nicely, at correct spot, well maintained), it's a 30 minute ride, When it reaches at top, you could see other neighboring countries (Indonesia and Malaysia). Rates are on higher side for 30 mins ride.",,,
,,Not worth $$,3,,"it cost $30 for 30mins. I think it is not very worth. I prefer stay in a restaurant around orchard area (33floor or higher) to have a lunch, high tea or dinner. Of which i can enjoy the view of Sg with food and stay as long as i wish.",,,
,,choose your time,4,,"much like other wheels around the world - its a lovely way to see the skyline (so much better than Melbourne thats for sure)
Has the usual info tunnel (to help fill in time during busy periods)
maybe go after its rained (cleans the glass) I went up after sunset - it was quiet, but definitely had missed the best time for photos (if thats what you really want). They weren't overfilling cabins & the personal hire of pods seemed to be popular (drinks included)...for those wanting more apparently they also do meal service in the pods....however, you will be watched by the people travelling in front of you & behind you...not a lot of privacy (but you could also have some fun with that haha)",,,
,,Flying High,4,,The Singapore Flyer offers amazing views of the Singapore skyline. Make sure you go on a clear day otherwise your view and your photographs are obscured by haze. The hawker food stalls at the base of the flyer are great for a meal or snack before or after your trip on the flyer.,,,
,,Great Views,5,,This was a great attraction to visit. Great views and photo shots you can see for miles it is definitely awesome.,,,
,,A great way to see the city and Grand Prix,5,,"A fantastic way to see the city sky line of singapore. Second visit this year which coincided with race night of the singapore Grand Prix, a great way to see and experience the race as you feel you are coming down over the top of the track",,,
,,Top feeling :),5,,"Ul feel like you are on the top of the world , u can see all the buildings beneath you , its pretty good feeling , small small cars riding fast like we do in games , its quite worthy . Shows you good views of singapore :)",,,
,,Slow.....yet beautiful!!!,4,,There are several places in Singapore from where you can see the city at a height. It is a thrill when you can see everything at one glance. The Singapore flyer is a 165m high giant Ferris wheel. You can experience the most breathtaking view from there. It can get a bit boring because it moves too slow. Its safe to take your chiildren along because you see everything from a glass capsules which look awesome. If you have been to Marina Bay Sands this attraction can very well be skipped because you have almost the same view. It is very well managed and no queue as such. Just get your passes and witness themost iconic attractions of Singapore!,,,
,,Good at night time,3,,This is really good experience to see Singapore in the night. And please visit this flyer only night time and try to go with some friends or family with more people. And price 33 sin dollar per adult. Only advantage can see night beauty of sin city . Nothing special other then this.,,,
,,A great way to see the city,4,,A great way to see the city and get your bearings. We went on a hazy day and it was still great! Defiantly take a city map with you so you know what you are looking for and where,,,
,,One of Several Ferris Wheel We Had Visited,3,,"Being a local we would not have come to the Singapore Flyer if not for our friends from overseas. As a family and on business we travelled extensively, and had been to at least 7 to 8 other ferris wheels around the world- London, Seattle, Moscow, Nanchang, etc etc. Ferris wheels are the same all over. The difference is just a matter of diameter size, height, and of course the sights. Some have metallic cabins. The Singapore Flyer has an all-glass enclosure. It is a little more expensive compared to other ferris wheels. This is no longer the tallest in the world. My friend came for the skyline of Singapore. Before the Flyer one would have to pay for dinner at the tallest revolving restaurant or a suite room on the top floor of a CBD hotel or a stop at Mount Faber, in order to take in a panoramic view of Singapore. We took a day trip which can be a little warm and sunny from the menancing sun, even though the cabins are fully air-conditioned. One can do a cooler dinner course if you wish and to pay more. Either way it is impossible to have a perfect value-for-money decision. So for memory and experience sake, just do it and don't sigh with regrets. Avoid the photographers, touts and souvenier shops if you want. You have a choice.",,,
,,Nothing too exciting,3,,"It was expensive for what it is, especially as you can get to see the views from other places. The best bit of advise we were given was to actually enter the flyer at 6.45 pm so that it turns dusk to night whilst you are on the flyer. We did this on the first night we were in Singapore, but then having explored Singapore, We would probably have left it to one of the last things to do, if you have time.",,,
,,worth the price,4,,"Singapore Flier is an unique experience to see Singapore city from the high...the view is really amazing, and allow you to see downtown, surroundings and seaside in a wonderful way. 30 minutes well spent, and even if the price is not cheap, it worths. Try it! :-)",,,
,,Biggest and the best,5,,Biggest flyer in the world and an extremely comfortable and luxurious one. You would love this. Amazing view of the iconic city. Choose your time. Whether you want to go with the sun and see the city or in the evening to see the lights.,,,
,,Fly high on the top of the singapore sky,5,,you can view the whole singapore once you reach the top of the flyer. It was given to us in the package by travelasia our tour and travels in singapore. Even if you do not have this sightseeing in your package included you can just ask for singapore sky flyer ride as it is located in centre of singapore and Many travel companies have their offices just under the Sky flyer. It is one of the prime sightseeing in singapore after the visit to universal studios and Jurong Bird Park. You can even include this after the Half day city tour of Singapore. They do hault after the tour near the flyer.,,,
,,A 360 degree view of Singapore,4,,"Good ride although steeply priced at 33 sing dollars. It offers a birds eye view of the city . We were lucky to get the whole capsule to ourselves, but be prepared to have co passengers. Its a slow ride up but not recommended for people with a fear of heights.",,,
,,30 minutes! You cannot exit midway and you should not be scared of heights,4,,"It is a 30 minute rotation to the top with a beautiful view of Marina Bay Business District. See it in the night time for a really good sight. You can see most of Singapore from here. But you can do better things in Singapore. Leave this for the kids, elders and family",,,
,,Not worthy,3,,"Its bit expensive and it takes about 30 mins for a ride. I starting feeling bored after 15 mins, and waited for the ride to complete.

Not worth of spending $30+ for just view, Can have better views from ur hotel also. They try selling you pictures captured for $35+, please don't buy.",,,
,,A thrilling ride.with awesome views,5,,We went in the afternoon .the flyer is a wonder of engineering...the sights are breathtaking.you can see the bay.marina bay sands.gardens by the bay..pan pacific hotel etc.it is clearly one of the best attractions of Singapore.,,,
,,View from top,4,,I like the view from the top. The pace of the wheel however is a bit slow. I have tried their 6D movie and I must admit that it was totally awesome. There are wide variety of food to choose from at the ground floor.,,,
,,Worth the money,5,,"Excellent views and pictures. Went up before sunset, really cool, not crowded at all. Kids enjoyed. There's bars and food underneath to grab a bite afterwards.",,,
,,great view of entire singapore,4,,best mode to get the ariel view of singapore .Definitely more worthy than marina bay sands top floor view. best time to get on board is around 5 pm as you get view of night as well as day life of singapore. Also the way to the flyer is pretty interseting.The total ride is about 32 minutes.,,,
,,amazing flight in the capsule,5,,"At 165 meters high, the fluer gives you an awesome views of Singapore CBD and suburbs.
A giant wheel, it takes about half an hour to complete one rotation. The entire setup is well maintained, professionally managed. I bought a combo ticket for flyer and the duckbus tour. The capsules are spacious, the glass in the capsules are very clean and offer great views. From top, you can see the CBD, Downtown, Marina bay, the dam on the reservoir, ships in the sea and the suburbs. A must visit for everyone visiting Singapore.

Pros:
1. Excellent views of Singapore
2. A good 30 minutes cycle which enables you to click as many pictures you wish from n number of angles
3. very well maintained and very clean
4. Restaurants at the basement serving local as well as international cuisines

Cons:
1. Too much commercial, many shops at the basement and at exit. Photographers clicking pics and selling at exorbitant prices",,,
,,Optional in case you have the time,3,,"The enitre journey takes ~ 40 minutes. In case you ahve the time you could go for it. The view is nice however there are ~ 25 people in the same capsule. Depending on the group, there may be some noise. You get a birds' eye view from up there of the bay and the city. In case you have already been in other flyers [other cities] this could be skipped.",,,
,,Spectacular Views,4,,"Yes, there isn't much excitement about ferris wheels in general. However, you are able to see the entire city from the highest point! We went on the Singapore Flyer as the sun began to set, so the city was all lit up. I would suggest you do the same. The views were spectacular and being able to see the city at night was amazing. If you have the time and money, I would encourage you to see the views from 541ft (165m) above the ground.",,,
,,Happy Singapore Holiday,5,,"This is one of those must do things
We did it a night flight and the lights of Singapore are breath taking
We Pre Booked a champagne flight expecting to share and when we got there we were the only couple so we had it all to our self a whole cabin was just us Win",,,
,,Safe and gentle view of Singapore,5,,Buy your tickets online and save 10%. Senior and student discounts are available. Wonderful and gentle ride to have a spectacular view of Singapore.,,,
,,Amazing view!,5,,I went with my family and the view was incredible! Not only that but its very relaxing and the wheel is really comfortable (a nice reprieve from the Singapore heat!),,,
,,Good fun,5,,On my second last trip to Singapore I did not get time to do the Flyer so this one I made sure I did it. Good fun and probably one of the must do things while in Singapore. Slightly expensive for what it is but still worth doing.,,,
,,Boring,2,,"By the time the flyer was half-way through, we hoped it would end. There is really nothing much to do or see.",,,
,,Amazing but other visitors were so rude,4,,"There was a group of Indian visitors. They blocked the best view and spent their time there posing bad photos.

Overall, it's a bit costly for a 30 minute visit on the sky to watch Marina Bay from the sky. But you can buy a 65-dollar combo at Changi Airport for 2 entrance tickets (worth 66 dollars) and 1 40-dollar voucher to dine at O'leary. Simply economical.",,,
,,Panoramic,4,,This will give you breathtaking view of Singapore's modern building and skyscrapers. The magnificent designs with a different perspective,,,
,,An awesome ride in the capsule,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a great 30-minute ride which gives a 360 degree view of Singapore. It is the best vantage point to see the beautiful garden city. It can be romantic too if you dine with your loved one in the evening.

I specially recommend the Singapore Flyer to tourists as you will enjoy the awesome view and experience the joy of riding the world's largest giant observation wheel.",,,
,,Do it first,4,,"Fantastic views, enabling you to get your head around the layout of the city. Not cheap, but not much is in Singapore, & they do have discounts for over 60's, just make sure you have some ID.",,,
,,GREAT VIEW,5,,"The cables are big and you can walk around so that you can appreciate the whole scene. What's more, you can see the F1 track just under you. You must get the map in the cable,with which you can know what to see in which direction. You can see the MODERN CITY WITH SKYSCRAPER and the DEEP BLUE SEA. Though the flyer is high, it is steady and safe,so you can enjoy your best time on the ferry wheel.",,,
,,Flying High!,5,,We found the Singapore Flyer experience was excellent in terms of the views and the length of time we had to enjoy them. We had a capsule to ourselves and it was brilliant. We were less impressed with the actual process of getting into the Flyer itself. There is a section of interactive information about the Flyer and it's construction while some may be interested we found it a bit too complex for us to bother with. The cost was reasonable. We enjoyed this experience very much!,,,
,,Sightseeing,5,,"I did the Singapore flyer with my wife.
The concierge at my hotel told me to go just before sunset which was 6:45pm.
A full rotation takes approximately 30 mins. This meant that I got pictures in daylight and pictures at night.
The view is excellent and a worthwhile attraction.
I thought this was a brilliant way to see all of the city.
I didn't agree with some people complaining about the price. It was $33 for some breathtaking views of the skyline.
One tip, take a good quality digital camera with lots of space on a memory card as you take loads of photos.
A must for any 1st time visitors.",,,
,,Another Ferris Wheel,3,,"If you like Ferris Wheel's, you will like this attraction. The London Eye is similar as it takes you up and offer a panoramic view of the city and surrounding environments. Bring your binoculars foor more views.",,,
,,Slow and steady,5,,Highest giant wheel...must try when in Singapore. during the day you can clearly see the buildings. During the night the view from the flyer is romantic...its just lights all around...,,,
,,Meh!,2,,Not really worth your time...The views are not all that spectacular and it gets old pretty quickly!!,,,
,,Super stunning view,5,,"One round lasts for 30 minutes, if you want to dine, it'll be for an hour. We decided to ride the flyer around 9pm and the view was really stunning! This is a must see attraction in Singapore. :)",,,
,,Good view,3,,View is beautiful. But nothing special. You feel bored after 5 minutes. Little expensive for what they offer.,,,
,,giant panoramic view,5,,this is one the best flyer which u can experience a panoramic view of Singapore. visitors can dine in while in the flyer,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,gives you a nice view of Indonesia and Malaysia and the capsules are very large. You do not feel sick at all and the ride is very nice. photo opps galore.,,,
,,It's a Fly time...,5,,One of the main attractions. You could see entire Singapore. Next to Marina Bay F1 track. Don't forget to eat at Restaurant on the ground floor...,,,
,,Singapore Heights,5,,"Another highlight to a trip, a ride of your life, highest in the world and with magnificent views over Singapore on a clear day you could see for ever",,,
,,awksome view of Singapore,4,,slow down your pace and watch the real city planning in Singapore,,,
,,Good views but expensive,3,,Only worthwhile with a Singapore Airlines stopover coupon. The journey itself is good but getting to the carriage is tiresome -- must go through dark 'museum' and have a picture taken. I recommend bypassing this as fast as possible (and refusing the photo). The display on worldwide observation wheels is interesting though and its profile should be raised. Exit through the gift shop.,,,
,,"Maybe good once, not a great value",3,,"Like most reviewers I think once is plenty for this. It's... exactly what you'd expect. A giant slow Ferris wheel. You can see the F1 stands, the skyline, the bay area, etc. Queue was super short. Takes about 30 minutes to go around.",,,
,,got to do,5,,always worth going on the big wheel in different countries so the flyer was a must .was not expensive,,,
,,Good to have the experience only once,4,,"This is a different experience indeed. Saw the marina bay sands side view from air. And saw the whole city area. Worth visit, but too expensive. Not good for budget trip. Other attractions in singapore is much cheaper when compare the level of satisfaction.",,,
,,ONCE IS ENOUGH,4,,"We decided to have a ride on the Flyer which gave us another oversight of Singapore from a different perspective. Like most attractions in Singapore it is very expensive for the 1/2 hour that it takes to go around. From an engineering feat it is very interesting.
I think that perhaps doing it at night if you have not been to Singapore before would be a better option.",,,
,,Must do in Singapore,4,,"A must do in Singapore. The slow rotation of the enclosed cars on this huge Ferris Wheel offer great views of the harbor, skyline, Marina Bay Sands, and Gardens by the Bay. The large pods unfortunately fit a fairly large group, so you may be sharing with loud children. The windows on the pods also make night photography a bit difficult as they tend to be a bit finger print covered. Still, a great way to see the city from on high.",,,
,,Great Views,4,,The Singapore Flyer offers great views of Singapore. The line was short and it was very convenient. I love these wheels for the ever changing view. In contrast to the London Eye this one did not have interactive maps showing all of the landmarks in the unit which was a bit disappointing. This is why I gave it 4 starts instead of 5. But overall it was very enjoyable with magnificent views over the city.,,,
,,Great views!,4,,"We took the flight at around 7:30 pm.We got a very crowded capsule, with not enough space to sit or take pictures. I guess that was just bad timing(being the beginning of a long weekend) because most of the other reviews seem to mention that they got a capsule that wasn't too crowded. However, the experience was truly amazing and we enjoyed the views of the Singapore skyline all lit up.",,,
,,Visit is must but taking a ride is not worth,3,,In terms of structure and how the flyer has been build its a must visit place but paying Rs 1500 appx for a 30 minute ride is not worth because you pay only for the view of city which anyways you are going to see if you are there for 2-3 days,,,
,,A must do on your list,5,,"WOW, take your camera and snap away at the wonderful views as you go around. Our family really enjoyed this experience. The wheel or flyer trip takes around 30 mins so ample time for photos. We enjoyed the great views of Singapore and saw the formula 1 track from above. The only downside is that we thought it a little expensive at $33 each, but heck, we were on holiday and worth it.",,,
,,Worthwhile experience,4,,This has always been in my bucket list of places to visit and experience in Singapore and it truly lived up to my expectations. The 360-degree views of the magnificent Singapore skyline is worth every dollar i paid for and more...,,,
,,nice view to the city center,4,,very nice view to marina bay at night. if there are not too much visitors you can ask staff to give you one cabin for your group.,,,
,,"Avaoidable, waste of money",2,,"A spectacular looking ferris wheel located near several taller buildings. The 'cabins' (if i can call them that) are all glass, which fogs out blinding any views there might be. The ferris wheel moves very slowly taking about 30mins to complate a round, with no toilets inside making it a very incomfortable and long 30 mins if you have to attend to a call of nature. Avoid.",,,
,,Fantastic view,4,,"One of the landmarks of Singapore, the flyer certainly lived up to expectations. It offers an amazing view, especially at night. A must visit for every visitor!",,,
,,Fine dining experience,3,,It was our 25th wedding anniversary thought we'd treat ourselves. The views from the flyer were spectacular. Of all the meals we have had in Singapore this would have to be the worst. A disappointment for Singapore cuisine. The most expensive meal we had in Singapore and the worst.,,,
,,Fantastic views of Singapore at night,4,,"We have been on the Singapore Flyer at 9:00 p.m. and it was a spectacular ""flight"". Singapore was lit up and offering fantastic views, i.e. the financial district, Marina Bay area, F1 race ciruit, downtown etc. The flight took about 30 minutes and was a very relaxing and enjoyable experience.",,,
,,Fun family activity,5,,"The flyer sits at the edge of the marina, goes really high up in glass capsules. Great view of the city and fun for families but I have to say my nephew leaning on the capsule glass made me nervous. IF you plan well you can do this in the afternoon after a day trip to Legoland Malaysia, their takeoff points lie close together.",,,
,,A must,4,,"if u want to get a feeling abt singapore, do that flyer thing. The costs seem to be reasonable, if u present a singapore airline boarding pass u even get a decent discount. We were only 7 people in the cabin, so enough space to move around and take too many pics. After the trip, there are some nice food stalls on the ground floor, makes u feel like in old singapore.",,,
,,fantastic view,5,,"Worth the cost of the tickets. The views were breathe taking! Try and pick a day when it is fairly clear to take full advantage of the views. We went during the day and loved it, but we had friends that did it at night and the lights at night looked beautiful too!",,,
,,Views are spectacular,4,,"Take a trip on the flyer and you can enjoy the views.
It takes almost 40 min. for the trip and it is best during the evening. if you like it to be fancy, then you can take the cable car with dining facility. best place for young couple to propose. :-)",,,
,,Fun visit,4,,There is amazing picture opportunity facing Marina Bay rooftop. You get incredible pictures. Flyer is way better than one present in London and has far more amazing feel to it. They should put better food there. However Singapore heat is something you have to fight.,,,
,,Spectacular,5,,"We managed to get to the magnificent Singapore Flyer (we only had part of a day in Singapore, between flights) but it is absolutely worth doing even if you don't have much time. It is an easy trip to get there from the airport using the metro system. The price is high, just over SGD$100 for a family, but worth it for the views in my opinion. It is a very slow rotation & the capsules are very large and felt very safe obviously (even for a couple of my family members who don't very much like heights!) I loved this part of Singapore also, the Marina Bay Area deserves a good look & time spent there.",,,
,,singapore flyer,5,,"A must visit attraction. You get full view of singapore. Good spot for photography. Though I visited in the morning to have a good view, evening will be nice to watch city lit up.",,,
,,Spacious Cabin with good view,4,,"Flyer cabin is very spacious, we can sit and walk around to get a good 360deg view of the city.
Safe, well maintained flyer. Goes very slowly located and scenic location. Loved the experience.
We were just 8 of in the cabin and it was very comfortable.

Its disable friendly also had one visitor who was on wheel chair, staff were very helpful in getting her in and out of the cabin.",,,
,,"Very cool, Very high, Good view at night of city",5,,"Such a cool piece of machinery, huge, high so cool, big rooms so family shots are easy. Also market under so plenty of food for snack.",,,
,,Could have given it a miss,3,,The flyer was a tad disappointing. Firstly you can't really see much of the bay and other parts of Singapore cos of limited height. Secondly it is expensive. You are better off having a drink at ku de at which is almost double the height of the flyer without obstruction. Just my opinion.,,,
,,Should never miss,5,,"It is very simple procedure. If ur a senior citizen u can purchase a ticket cheaper. No questions asked. Staff are very friendly.
Once you go into the cubicle you can either sit or stand as you like.
One rotation is exactly 1/2 an hour. This is the best way to see Singapore",,,
,,quiet wheel turn,4,,"the wheel turn is so swift and quiet, we keep turning up and down without noticing the movement of the cabine. it is very well organised and safe. the view is amazing!",,,
,,Good View at one go,4,,At one go you can see the entire Singapore. Good opportunities for Photos. We went in the evening time so we could see in day light as well as dark. All Enjoyed well. There are many eating places and other attractions in the same building.,,,
,,Memorable,4,,"Still a great experience,third time up.But really well run and whilst expensive a holiday would not be the same without the flight and mid morning was an excellent time with a capsule to ourselves.Excellent choice of good souvenirs in the departure lounge ranging in price.I would and no doubt will return next trip.",,,
,,Touristy,2,,"Very touristy, not worth the cost for a 30 minute loop or the outrageous price for a dinner aboard for an hour. Try the hawker's stands at the base for a quick and reasonably priced lunch.
Better viewed from afar. Go to the top of Marina Bay sands an see the flyer at night, beautify.",,,
,,Loved it,4,,"We really enjoyed this, even thought it was a bit hazy the views are stunning. It was easy to get on and off, not crowded (unlike London/Paris/Dubai where you queue for hours for similar attractions). Would be fun to do it in the evening/night - especially with a meal served in the capsule..",,,
,,Fun Thing to do,5,,Visited Singapore for 4 days when returning home from Australia. This was one of the tourist things we did and loved it. The views you see are amazing and very well priced. Friendly staff and surrounding area is really nice with lots more to do. Would 100% recommend this to anyone.,,,
,,Night View is the Best!,5,,Visited with my parents and they were amazed with the views. Planned it such taht we can see the night lights and it was amazing to see the GArdens light show form top. amazing. You can get a view of MBS from here.,,,
,,Good time pass,4,,"Huge like London eye,look at whole of Singapore from the top, the river front,looks nice from top ,kids love it,great place to click pics",,,
,,Well worth a ride,4,,"Great view and gave a great overall roadmap of singapore. Not sure you would get a cloud free day, but view still ok. Amazing artistic architecture, some quite quirky. Glad we took the time.",,,
,,Great view from at the top,5,,"Sg flyer was a great experience. The wheel continuously moves at a constant speed and at a slow pace. You are asked to enter by the guides and your journey begins. Slowly as the wheel rotates u get to see all high raise buildings of Sg. On the sea sides u get to see islands fleets of ships entering Sg waters. F1 circuits are visible from top. It's belief that you request a wish on the top most point.
If you own a dslr keep changing the lens to take images in and out of the capsule. Worth the money for the ride.",,,
,,Amazing view +tip,5,,Must go there. My tip is to buy the tickets from this web http://www.viator.com/tours/Singapore/Singapore-Flexi-Attractions-Pass-Singapore-Zoo-Night-Safari-and-Flyer/d18-5251SINFLEXI the flexi pass to the zoo and the night safari. You get to save up to 14$ each. Enjoy,,,
,,sky high,5,,Absolutely enormous giving fantastic veiws over Singapore. Was a bit foggy due to smoke from a fire in Sumatra so good idea to check it out before you book to go on.,,,
,,excellent view of Majestic Singapore,5,,Too good and very good for those people who fear height and speed as the movement is not that drastic and steady speeds keeps you engrossed with sea on one side and huge tall buildings on the other side.,,,
,,OK,3,,Too slow moving for me. The view is not sustaining because of this. I ended up chatting to other passengers who felt the same.,,,
,,if you have time its good to see,3,,takes 30 minutes to go around. i would probably next time do the champagne or tea time tour with friends. the view is beautiful and you can definitely capture some excellent topical view shots.,,,
,,Great views,5,,Singapore Flyer is a fantastic way to see the views of Singapore. It takes 30 minutes for a revolution and there's every opportunity to get great photos. I've read some reviews that say 30 minutes is too long and boring. I don't get it! What a way to spend half and hour. A must do in Singapore.,,,
,,How to view Singapore in a whole new light,4,,"We had limited time in Singapore so decided to have the 'Singapore Flyer Experience' . The 'ferris wheel' towers at 165m above sea level and allows you to take in views of Singapore in a 'bird's eye view'. We went on a clear day so saw the Marina Bay and think we saw Malaysia and Indonesia but maybe we are just hoping! The cabins are large and have seating provided, however, we stood at the windows to take advantage of the views. I suggest that if you are older or enjoy a 'quiet' experience, and there is a group of school students or a young family waiting to board, you try to select another cabin, as you will be with them for 45 minutes and that could be 'difficult'. (No offence meant to families, I am a teacher and love littlies, I just understand that it is hard to keep excited kids quiet and that would spoil everyone's fun- yours included).
I was disappointed that there wasn't a commentary explaining the sights and we spent a great deal of our time looking at a map for points of reference to identify buildings, however, a good interactive activity.
There are a number of different options, including; a Full Butler Sky Dining flight; a Moet and Chandon champagne Flight; a Signature Cocktail flight, a Singapore Sling flight, and a High Tea flight. You can even take a 'Solemnisation Package' which includes a stay at the Ritz Carlton. There are a selection of shops and restaurants and it is close to public transport. Definitely worth a visit. If they had an audio, it's a definite 5star rating",,,
,,Worth It!,5,,"You must visit this attraction. It takes about 45 minutes to do the full circle and is definitely worth it. At the top of the flyer you are to see the whole of Singapore, Very impressive!!",,,
,,Best view of Singapore,5,,"You can see the entire Singapore from the top and it's an amazing view. Only drawback is that there is no audio/written guide so you have to guess at what part of the city you are looking at. The wheel turns slowly and with large windows you can take in the views easily. It is definitely a must-do when you visit Singapore.

Tip: Try to do this at night as the night view is way better than the day view and then you can even catch the Promenade laser show from your cabin.",,,
,,Excellent views,5,,We enjoyed this so much that we went on it in the day as well as the night time. The views are fantastic and the 30min rotation gave us time to take in these sights.,,,
,,Interesting with kids,3,,"Basically not interested in, our daughter wanted to visit this big wheel like an attraction in famous Parks. Organization was quite good and visit lasts around 30min. View is amazing on Marina Bay and a good part of Singapore. Our 5 years old daughter really enjoyed it. Notice that each cell is equipped with Air conditioning.",,,
,,Good view from up there,4,,"You can see most of Singapore from up there. I was hoping there is an audio explaining about the location around, but there isn't.
So, we are guessing what we are looking at (except for the Garden by The Bay, Skypark, or other buildings that well known by public).",,,
,,Must visit once,5,,If you want to have a good view of the city this is a must visit. Indian restaurant on 1st floor serves good food.,,,
,,Nice view from up above,5,,"We enjoyed the, more or less, one hour ride. The view was splendid and we didn't notice to time at all. We will visit again next time at night time. I'm sure it is far more better at night",,,
,,A must when u visit singapore,5,,This place really is awesome to visit at night time. The singapore from atop is quite spectacular and awesomely admirable,,,
,,Meh... not great,3,,"I didn't really enjoy the flyer.
$30 for approx 30 minutes... some dinky music playing. Would be good if there was a voice over telling you about Singapore and the views.
Thought it was a disappoint experience.
I would not take elderly people on this as the flyer doesn't stop... you have to jump on and off the (very slow) moving cart and it can be a bit scary and possibly not very safe for people with mobility issues.",,,
,,Wonderful views seen at liesure,5,,"The flyer slowly rotates giving a all round view of the bay - seen the grand prix grid - the hotel with a ship on top - or just enjoy the
view of the ships in the harbour.
The wheel turns slowly and with large windows you can take in the views and really enjoy.
When we were there only 2 other people in the carriage so not overcrowded.
Great for all ages .
Taxis back into the city readily available and not expensive.",,,
,,i enjoyed the view,3,,"You have to walk from Suntec mall to the flyer if you do not have a private car or with a tour group. When we got there on a Sunday, it wasn't crowded, it was just right.

It was nice seeing a view of the city through this like the London Eye, Malaysia eye. Best is late afternoon, towards sunset for the view.",,,
,,A must do,4,,"This is a must do activity that you can do at the beginning of your tour, to pick and choose what would you like to do the rest of the time you will spend there, or at the end, when you can summarize all the things you have done, and locate them from there....... Very relaxing !........",,,
,,A must do!,4,,Great activity and the view is great from the Flyer. There's plenty of food stalls and restaurants available at the ground level which offer good quality food of all kinds. A lot of tour buses depart from the Flyer so getting a combo ticket is worthwhile where you do a city tour and Flyer on the same day.,,,
,,Amazing views,4,,"Aproximately half an hour to go round. The views are really amazing, totally recommendable. Sunset is a plus",,,
,,Nice views,5,,"Great views from above, comfy and stable capsule.
Ticket is about SGD 33,00/person for the regular ride, but you can have the special rides, which can be one with Moet & Chandon champagne or dinner ride, among others.
I've been there during day time, and line was almost inexistent.
From there, easy walk leads you to Marina Shoppes.",,,
,,Great Experience!,5,,On my previous visit to the city I missed on Singapore Flyer but this time I was determined to visit it after reading great reviews. And I was not disappointed at all. Not only you are thrilled by the experience great view of surrounding like Marina Bay and other parts of the city while sitting on one of the enclosures of the giant wheel but you marvel at the engineering feat accomplished with a flawless construction and maintenance and you will very secure while being on the wheel. I simply loved it!,,,
,,Good night time views..,3,,Walked to the Singapore Flyer through the Helix bridge and the Singapore Flyer experience was only average. The crowd was minimal and the views from the cabin were very good. But the cabin was a little crowded and the 20 minute ride can be relaxing.,,,
,,"...nice, but",3,,...too expensive for what you see! Use 1 Altitude instead with a drink and nice music- better view!!!,,,
,,"Amazing, must do in Singapore!",5,,"Def worth the money $33, to see the spectacular view!
Rotation takes 30 minutes and goes so slow you don't even really feel like you are moving, it's so smooth.
Each capsule holds 28 but they were only putting in around 10 in each the day we went. That was great as there was plenty of room to walk around the capsule and see out the windows.
Our son(6) loved it and thought it was amazing!
Would loved to have done it again at night!
You can also get a souvenir photo of the experience $20",,,
,,Good view but something missing to make it better!,4,,The view is good but it is difficult to take real good pictures at night through the Plexiglas curved windows.,,,
,,Brilliant (on a clear day!),5,,"Definitely recommend this, particularly on a clear day. Air conditioned pods, brilliant views all around the city and very helpful & friendly staff. Don't think It would be nearly so good on a hazy or cloudy day though. Ride takes half an hour.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer Experience,5,,"A magical experience. The views were fantastic and we took the same view at various elevations as the wheel went around - the results were spectacular. It gave us a wile new perspective on the Singapore skyline as well as highlighting some other features - the F1Race Track, the floating football field, and the number of ships in Singapore Bay waiting to be unloaded. A great 30 minutes.",,,
,,Excellent way to star the trip!,4,,Excellent way to start the Singapore trip! Birds eye view was awesome! This offered the best views of Singapore (even better than Marina Bay Sands).,,,
,,Lovely views at night time.,4,,"We did it at night and wandered slowly along from Clarke Quay, a really lovely evening activity. Yes, it鈥檚 a bit expensive ($32/ 拢16) for just 30 mins BUT the views are just fantastic, really breathtaking. The lit-up skyscrapers were very special and we could see over the F1 track which was being assembled. We really enjoyed it. Some people on here have complained about the queues- we were lucky as we (couple) were just two of a total of five people in our capsule- however, if we were unlucky and it was busy, we would have gone down to the bar or gelato stand or restaurants within the Flyer complex and gone up an hour later! Easy!
We enjoyed the gelato after- a bit pricey- $8 each- but SO YUMMY!",,,
,,must do,5,,"Even though it is a bit pricey, it is a must do.
I did most of the singapore sight seeing with combo tickets but this one was best stand alone ticket taken at the site.
Be a bit early especially in peak season and holidays.
A lot of souvenirs to be had all along the area.
Take a good camera for long shots!!",,,
,,Nice sightseei gs,4,,"Nice sightseeings!!. Really similar to The London ese, despide Singapore's flyer is bigger. I rinde the Flyer during daylight, the vieja rise kil贸metros away, really amazing.",,,
,,Expensive,2,,In a city like London where the eye is one of the taller structures you get unparalleled views of the place. Here in singapore if you have access to other skyscrapers like the bay sands hotel or swisshotel then it's not worth visiting the singapore eye. It's close to 35 singapore dollars per adult.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"Having never been on one of these before, it was a good experience and a great way to see the city. It was quite hazy during my ""flight"" but, you could see a good part of the island and all the ships passing the Straights. Surprisingly not that busy when I visited. Good selection of food outlets underneath.",,,
,,Great Views!,5,,"The largest big wheel in the world, so we had to go on that, didn't we?!! Great views & very serene - well worth it.",,,
,,Great View,3,,"Lines were pretty short for a Saturday night. Got tickets about 6.40pm was on board by 6.55pm so able to see day turn to night think this is the best time to go. $33 an adult 13+ wanted identification to show age of my 12 year old though this was quite unreasonable as I don't carry my passports around cities with me. So just paid an adult ticket (child $21)
About 16 of us in the capsule can be up to 28 this would be a tight fit. Only seating for about 8-10 inside but find standing is a better view. Goes for about 30 minutes in total no rocking very stable. Was a good tourist attraction got to see the F1 track that is bring dismantled at present.",,,
,,Awesome experience,5,,"Went here not expecting much, but was very delighted. The cars on the flyer and the timing of our visit made it possible for us to have an entire car for ourselves. The next 30 minutes of one flight rotation was pure delight. Kids really loved it! And so did we! My parents and father in law were scared to get on at first assuming it was going to be like one of those rollercoaster experiences but later thoroughly enjoyed themselves as the slow rotation of the flyer makes it not scary at all!

Awesome trip and totally worth it! The shops and eateries around this area make it even more appealing. Also it is a stone's throw away from MRT (which is how we visited it the first time) which makes it very accessible too!",,,
,,JUST ONE OF THE MANY EXCITING ATTRACTIONS THE CITY HAS OT OFFER,5,,"The Singapore flyer offer one an unparralled view of the city , Marina bay area , the best time to take a flight is early evening when the sun is setting over the Bay and twilight is on the horizon , the colors of the city are truelly amazing , or yet better stil a flight at night tiem tosee all the city lights from high up,.
An attraction not to be missed out on when in Singpaore .",,,
,,Great nighttime views of Singapore,5,,"The views from the flyer at night are excellent. This is a different experience to the London eye where the views are about seeing the whole of London. Here it is compact with the lights of Boat Quay, Gardens by the Bay and Marina Sands particularly. Well wirth a visit",,,
,,Great view,4,,"I felt it expensive until we started the ride. Excellent views, very stable with no rocking, needs more seating so there is enough seating for everyone though. There was 19 in the cabin, but I think they can have 25.

We enjoyed it so much on the morning trip that we have booked to go again on Friday night at 7.30pm so we can see the night lights including the Gardens in the Bay show at 7.45pm.",,,
,,Just Fine for first timers,3,,"To go here, alight the Promenade station and just walk a few blocks. We did this during sunset so we wouldnt have to bear with the glaring sun atop the eye. And also its much nicer to appreciate the top view of everything when the buildings lit up like christmas lights. If you want a great view of SG, i think the Marina Bay Sands Skypark is way better, but the SG Flyer gave me a closer look at the F1 Racing circuit. It wasnt as fun as it should be because it rained so hard while we were on the Flyer. Sometimes they cut off the service when its raining really hard. What's good though is you can discover other attractions that's on this place like the Flight simulation thing or you can walk the Helix Bridge towards the Marina Bay Sands.",,,
,,Great Views,5,,"It was a great experience, with great views. Went there around 4pm but should have gone on a little later as the lights turn on when the sun sets. There was not a lot of crowd when we went and only had 6 other people in the cabin with us. Spacious cabin and able to walk around and take photos with ease. Had some food in the food court downstairs and that was nice too.",,,
,,Best views of Singapore,5,,"The flyer was an excellent experience and well worth the $33 ticket price. This offered the best views of Singapore (even better than Marina Bay Sands). We went about 9pm at night which meant it was very quiet and we only waited about 1 minute before boarding and got a capsule to ourselves for a group of 4.
Becuase of the F1 GP it was hard to get in and out of the flyer area easily but I am sure this is not normally an issue. We had to walk a significant distance before getting to an open street with taxis.",,,
,,It's big,4,,This is reputed to be the biggest wheel in the world. I takes about 40 minutes to go round with fantastic views. If you want a romantic meal I understand that can be arranged,,,
,,Good way to see Singapore from above,4,,"It is a very good way to see Singapore from above. We were there in the evening and, to our surprise, it wasn't that crowded. Keep in mind that the light in the cabins might ruin your photos, if you go at night. However, the view is worth it...",,,
,,Nice View but expensive,4,,The view was nice at night with all the buildings and skyscrapers lighted up at night. The price of the ticket was a bit expensive considering the flight was only about half an hour.,,,
,,Singapore view from Bird's Eye... Its Singapore Flyer,5,,Visiting the flyer in day time is the best...It gives you the clear view of entire Singapore country once you are on the top (168 Meter from Ground Level). There is no point in visiting Singapore and missing the flyer.,,,
,,amazing,5,,The views are stunning. Reasonably priced and we didn't have to queue. There are various tickets available combining the Flyer and bus tours.,,,
,,Fly on the Flyer,5,,"A good tip is to go on the Flyer during the day and then again in the evening when the Flyer and the city is lit up. It,s the highest Flyer Wheel in the world and is well worth a ride ..... Don,t forget your camera!!",,,
,,Great view of Grand Prix track,4,,"Great views , takes around 30 minutes to complete. Bit hazy the day we went so didn't see as far as seemingly could.",,,
,,An Enjoyable Flight!,4,,A very enjoyable trip around the flyer giving excellent opportunity to take photographs of the city and the river. A very smooth and almost motionless movement of a very spacious pod around the wheel. A lot better than the London Eye. We visited during Grand Prix Weekend and still found we had plenty of room in the pod (only 5 people in our pod) and the pods are very large. Around the base of the wheel there are bars and restaurants.,,,
,,Birds Eye Veiw,4,,"Being confined to a wheelchair, you do not want to miss out on anything. This was an experience that exceeded my expectations. The staff provided an exceptional service, ensuring my safety came first. I was able to get into the gondola with ease, with the cycle taking about 30 minutes. The cost is $28, however we pre purchased a combo ticket from the hotel and saved $10 on each ticket.",,,
,,double wow,5,,this is a brilliant way to see the expanses of singapore even better seeing the grand prix being set up so relaxing,,,
,,An overview of Singapore,4,,"A brilliant option to get a relaxed overview of Singapore. Like everything else in Singapore, a well set up facility.",,,
,,Good way to get your bearings.,5,,Did this after City Sightseeing Tour but had very long walk to the entrance due to road closures during F1 Grand Prix. Went on 6pm 'flight' - would have been even more impressive slightly later when all the lights came on but it gave a very good view across the whole of the F1 track and helped me to get my bearings of the city as a whole.,,,
,,Amazing during F1 race,5,,"We went on Singapore Flyer during the F1 race and it was amazing. We had grand stand tickets and watched the start of the race from there, but decided to see part of the race from the flyer and it was so worth it. There was pretty much no one there, and the view was fantastic not just of Singapore but also F1 race track. It was a great way to combine the two ;-) It takes 30 minutes to go around and we got to see the restart from the safety car from up above. It was an unforgettable part of the Singapore F1 experience.",,,
,,Magnificent views,5,,"Stable ride, no wobbling or rocking. Spacious capsule. Half hour ride. Not enough seating for everyone.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"At first felt it was a little expensive at S$ 33 p.p., however once you experience this 30 minute ride you realise it is worth it.",,,
,,Superb!,5,,Gives you a bird's view of its sorroundigs. Spectacular also at night. Can easily be reached by MRT and a short walk.,,,
,,Great experience,5,,"I managed to get on the Flyer during the F1, so had the privilege of seeing the track from above as well as the rest of the city skyline. You can see so much. It's pretty pricey, but I think it's worth it. The ride goes quite slowly, taking 45mins for a full circle, so you get plenty of time to sit down & relax as well as manically taking a stupid number of photo's. Would definitely recommend to others.",,,
,,Great attraction,4,,Terrific attraction with spectacular views. Its worth the money. We had a bit of a problem getting to it to start with as it was sectioned off for the grand prix. We were glad we made a second attempt.,,,
,,Experience the view,4,,Flyer ride takes about 30mins. S'pore Flyer adult ticket cost $33/- & child (3-12yrs) cost $21/-. The ride is very stable and as if it is not moving. When you capsule reach the top you could see the city landmark. For honeymoon couple you could book dinner or champaign at flyer. Try to experience.,,,
,,Seeing singapore's view in an hr,4,,"The place is.awesome. Best to visit at night. Highly recommended for photographers to visit at night. Aside. From. This,",,,
,,A must do when in Singapore,5,,"The views at night are stunning and the whole experience is quality. Great staff, perfect service and value for money. Male sure your camera batteries are charged as you will be snapping away",,,
,,Romantic Date,4,,Great way to experience Singapore view. Book a private flyer if you're on a romantic date! Wine/Champage with your special other.,,,
,,Birds Eye View,5,,"The Singapore Flyer gives a good view over Singapore and as we did it over the course of the Grand Prix weekend we got to see everything that was going on with the circuit lit up.

Personally I think doing it at night gives you better pictures and shows you Singapore at night but that is my own personal view.
Having been past the flyer on quite a few occasions previously I have never seen a big queue so it doesn't matter what time you arrive it won't be a long wait like it can be on the London Eye.",,,
,,great sights,5,,"a must do to get a good view of the city skyline, try going up as dusk is falling to see the city scape light up in front of you.",,,
,,Must see in Singapore and enjoy dinner too,5,,It is a must see and do in Singapore. We took the Dinner Option on the Flyer and must say it was a memory. It takes about an hour for the dinner on board the Flyer but very relaxing and enjoyable. The food was very good and the sights were great.,,,
,,Get High in Singapore!,5,,"From a distance you have no idea how big this structure is. Having been on the London eye, the Toykyo Wheel in Odaba, naturally I had to do this one! Gondolas are air-conditioned and the view is truly incredible. The ride itself is so smooth you can barely feel the wheel turning and for those like my kids that are maybe a little nervous around heights this is a bonus as the gradual position changes mean that you are concentrating on the view not on the movement of the the wheel
Don't bother with the tourist photos . Like many tourist venues around Singapore it's just a ""blue screen"" with various scenes.
Price is about 33 SPD per adult about $10 cheaper for kids.
I overheard a lady in line with us saying same saved 10% by booking online. Might be an option for you. Great views, this wheel is worth the time and money!",,,
,,Worth it for the views,5,,"This can seem a little pricey at first glance, but it is well worth the cost. I paid SG$28 with a Grand Prix promotion, but I ended up with a pod to myself. The rotation took around 30 minutes and the views were spectacular - it was a clear, sunny day and you could see for miles. I ended up with some great photos and it really put the geography of the island in my mind better than any map.

There was an interesting display before you board the pod too, so you can learn about how it was built and how it works. Also, a pretty extensive gift shop when you leave.

A highlight of my trip!",,,
,,Great views,4,,"The views from the the flyer are great, however I think 3o minutes was a little bit long. By the time we were on the way back down I was ready to go. It's quite expensive at $33. The lady at the counter implied that my dad was over 60, when he realised it meant he got in cheaper ($24) he went with it even though he's only 54. They didn't ask for ID. Getting to the flyer was a bit of a nightmare for us. There were no signs at Promenade station giving any direction as to where to go. Being a major tourist attraction we expected it to be better signposted. We ended up getting lost and walking over the two big bridges. Granted the F1 had been on that weekend and a lot if the roads and foot paths were blocked off. For the amount of time and hassle it took us to get there and back again we didn't feel the trip was worth it.",,,
,,BORING!!!,1,,"This was the worst money we spent in Singapore. The windows were fogged up which defeated the purpose of going up that high and it takes 30 minutes to do a full lap, in fogged up windows that you can't see out of. Do not bother!",,,
,,Singapore Flyer FLY HIGH experience,5,,"Must visit place in Singapore, one can enjoy night and day time flying experience. Unlike the other roll coaster rides or moving ones this ride would not cause any discomfort one can view the full Singapore business area riding this",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"Not much to say here - fantastic views of the city and surrounding areas. Good value at S$33 but I got a 15% discount with my Formula One tickets. Shops and restaurants in the complex along with ""street food"" type places at the ground floor.",,,
,,Fly high,4,,"Although bit costly i.e 50 S$, good to get an aerial view of such an architecturally cultured city, with high rises from every angle to see",,,
,,"Wow Wow Wow, you have to do this ride, its a total buzz!",5,,It takes half an hour to go around and for $33 each it was worth every cent. we went on it around 8.45pm and by the time we were at the top the tree light show began on the other side of the river and was great to see from the air in the night. Make sure you do this if your in Singapore even if you have a fear of heights. Its totally still and there is no movement in the canister you are going around in.,,,
,,AMAZING,5,,"My husband and I did this as part of the Singapore Grand Prix. I expected it to be packed but we were the only two in our pod. We had great views over the city, marina bay, the gardens etc. we also had the views of the race track when the classic cars we're racing ... Brilliant.
At the equivalent of 拢15 I think this was really good value for money .. Lasted about half an hour.",,,
,,A must do.,5,,"We went on the Singapore flyer as my son came to visit from the UK.
We booked the Singapore Sling flight for $69 each.
We were told to arrive half an hour before the flight which we duly did. We had to wait for five minutes in the lounge and were then escorted upstairs to the bar.
We were there for ten minutes while we waited for our capsule to arrive ( there are different ones for inflight eating/drinking.
When it arrived we were again, escorted by a very efficient young man to the capsule We boarded and were greeted by TWO waiters who served our drinks.
Once in motion it was easy to see how this was going to be a great experience. It was quite a clear day so the views were spectacular. Singapore does have a beautiful skyline that is not fully appreciated until you view it at a height. Some beautiful architecture can be seen from all angles.
As is typical of Singapore, everything is very clean and the service efficient throughout.
It's a great experience.",,,
,,one time experience,3,,"one time experience, good to do in a day to see whole view....all famous places you can see...easily connected with hotel thru subway",,,
,,singapore flyer,5,,must do . heaps to see well worth the money. bit hard to work out high rise buildings as there are so many of them.,,,
,,30 mins of bird eye Singapore,3,,"The only reason to do Singapore Flyer (after doing it twice, once is for a discount), is to get a bird eye's view of the island city, and to see how intricate and neat the island really is. The cabin has a glass floor so you can see clearly the details when you are at the top. However it is really hot to do this at daytime. If you really want a moving view, try sunset time, take the 6.30 slot thereabout so you can enjoy the beautiful sunset in the background of the Singapore river.",,,
,,I loved it...,5,,"This flyer is safe and steady especially who afraid of heights. We went there in the sunset time, the view was fabulous, you can see all the surroundings form above... I will try it again on my my next visit!",,,
,,Re-visited Singapore Flyer,3,,"Re-visited Singapore flyer in August during one of the weekend upon the request of my youngest child. Every time, we drove past the singapore flyer she never failed to remind me that she has yet to take a ride on the flyer while her siblings shared their experiences on the flyer.

The tickets could be better priced but generally the ride does create positive memories for the family. It would be better if the tickets purchased could be allowed for multiple entry instead of one admission currently. This probably will neutralize the pricey feeling when one consider and compare this to other landmarks in the area that can offer equivalent view to the surrounding.",,,
,,Amazing,4,,"Singapore Flyer,the highest in the world is an amazing experience.A 30 min ride cost 33 singapore dollars for an adult 24 singapore dollars for a senior citizen and 21 singapore dollars for a child between 3 to 12 years. If you book on line you get a 10 % discount and if you have travelled to Singapore by Singapore airlines your boarding pass gets you 20 % discount on the full fare.Please do visit www.singaporeflyer.com for full details.

The flyer can be reached by Mrt the nearest station being Promenade on the yellow and blue line.and a few mins walk from Promenade brings you to the flyer. Each Capsule has benches in the centre and enough place to move around . The view from the flyer of Singapore is Amazing, the best time to be in the flyer is around 6.30 to 7 pm when the sun is setting and the city is being lit. I will let the pictures describe the beauty of the experience",,,
,,Feel on top of the world,4,,"Flyer trip is for 30 minutes, and its worth the time. Excellent aerial view of the city landscape in the lights.",,,
,,Bay View,4,,We can see the scenery around the Marina Bay from the heights. The price is quite expensive to follow this attraction.,,,
,,A birds-eye view,5,,"A slow and smooth ride in a large, walk-around capsule with views high over the downtown city area. This great construction gives a real perspective of this amazing city. We were especially blessed to have a small group of 5 people with a Singaporean guide so found out a lot more than we otherwise would have. Having lived in Singapore in the late ""70s we really appreciated the opportunity to view from this structure.",,,
,,Great way to see the city,5,,This was a great way to see the sights of Singapore... was value for money and we had a great time. Got to see both the city and the shipping lane which blew our minds due the amount of ships entering and leaving this port,,,
,,amazing views,5,,this was truly amazing and to be able to look down on the circuit for the Grand Prix baing laid out was special. The staff were very good with my husband in his mobility scooter.,,,
,,Good to get a layout of the city,4,,"Not a must-see, but it was a great way to get a layout of the city before we started. We went a little before noon and had the car all to ourselves which was nice. The ride was smooth, not jerky at all, and the car was air-conditioned. We paid $33/pp -- not a great value, but ok as a tourist attraction.",,,
,,It was nice enough,3,,"When we went , there wasn't much to see from the flyer..I did find it expensive considering there wasnt all that much to see. the little shopping centre at the base was pleasant enough and provided a venue to get cool drinks..",,,
,,Wonderful views,5,,"We have a night-time ride on the flyer and it was great. No queue to worry about and the pods were not crowded. Only 8 people in ours so plenty of space to wander about and take photos.
Good to see Singapore at night from a different perspective.",,,
,,The Best Experience In Singapore,5,,"I recently went on the Singapore Flyer when I was visiting Singapore for the F1. I decided to go on the Thursday as Friday to Sunday of the GP weekend, only certain ticket holders could access the flyer.
Going at 7:45pm was the best choice I made as when I got to the top, the Safety Car and Medical Car were doing runs around the track. Singapore at night is one of the most beautiful sights I have seen in my life. You can see the life and vibrancy of the city atop the flyer, and I was lucky enough to also have the sound of the AMG Mercedes engines playing in the background.
I found it to be very well priced for the time it took (roughly half an hour, I think).
This is a must for anyone traveling to Singapore.",,,
,,Hyped,3,,Not as being projected. Only for an aerial view of the city as the wheel moves up. visitors keep on standing in front of the bench blocking the view.,,,
,,Not Quite Like the London Eye...,3,,"Well I admit that it is very unfair but obvious that we will always compare with First one i.e. London Eye.
Well I had a good time at the Flyer but i wont say it was not outstanding. But had a nice view of the Singapore sky line. But if you decide to go then after the Sunset when the light are on that's a Sight. There are also options to have Wine and Dine option in the Flyer. If you have the money you can spend and make you Love surprised and happy.",,,
,,Pleasant visit.,4,,"The waiting room consist of comfortable air-conditioned, very lengthy corridor featuring many explanations of the building and flyer technology, and cool-looking ambient artworks, which does decent work at distracting you if the queue is lengthy. We visited at off-peak day so we just breezed through everything and get a capsule just for ourselves.

The capsule is clean and has ample space to sit and move around. The climb is slow and smooth and take 30 minutes or so, we didn't feel any vibration or shake from the wind so it felt very safe. The view of the golf course when you climb is boring, while the view of the Marina Bay Sands and the garden at the peak and afterwards are quite neat.

When you exit, there's all-right souvenir store where you can buy quite pricey print of a photo they took before you depart. And there's ample amount of cafes and restaurant--including faux-hawker food stand area below if you're hungry.",,,
,,"Superb View But not thrilling.,,.",4,,"Good Aerial View Of Singapore City ut lil Boring Too, U can click some pics and come back it was not much thrilling, Good but not at its best",,,
,,Great views,5,,The flyer has the best views of the Singapore city scape.We did it at night and really enjoyed it. Takes just under 30 mins to get round.,,,
,,A ride with a view,4,,A nice and different view of Singapore! Loved the air conditioned ride in the flyer in the cabins for about 10 - 20 people (?) . Luckily hardly anyone was there when we visited for the Singapore view at night. A little expensive but worth the experience.,,,
,,Great views,4,,"I am not sure why they bother with the museum bit but the flight on the flyer is great, especially if you time the visit so that you see the city both in daylight and darkness ie about 6.45pm.",,,
,,Worth doing,5,,Great place to get pictures and take in the views of Singapore. It moves very slowly so you have ample time to take in the sights.,,,
,,great views but otherwise just a big ferris wheel,3,,my headline pretty much captures everything i would have to say about the flyer. Nothing really special except the views i guess. But yes worth a visit at least once.,,,
,,Way too expensive for a 'not so special' experience,2,,"We visited the flyer last year and had bought the tickets at S$33 each which now I think is way too much for the experience you get on board. There are many other places around Marina Bay which offer a similar (or even better) view of the beautiful Singapore skyline for less or even free. Eg: Level33 restaurant, KuDeTa night club, 1-Altitude or even the MBS Skypark Observation Deck (S$20).

I agree that this is a one-of-a-kind world's tallest observation wheel and a great feat of civil engineering but the experience is not that exciting as one would expect and you tend to get bored just after a few minutes into the ride

Trust me, you are better off spending your time and money at any of the above mentioned places where you do not have to pay such a high price just for the view of the city.",,,
,,Amazing View,4,,"Everywhere now has a big wheel haha but the views from here were great, especially as you had great views of the forthcoming Grand Prix coming together",,,
,,Lovely views of Singapore,4,,"The flyer is took 30 minutes.. A nice ride.. Not long nor short.. The view is great, and an hour before sunset was great timing..",,,
,,Great views,4,,"I enjoyed this trip around the Singapore Flyer as it provided excellent views of the city. I see others thought it expensive - and I see it was S$33 - yes that is expensive. I went for free as part of a Singapore Airlines stopover deal. I certainly wouldn't have paid S$33 for it otherwise.

Thought the exhibition you walked through to get to the Flyer was unnecessary.",,,
,,A GREAT VIEW,5,,"We had a very enjoyable 30-min. ride as the weather was reasonably clear with slight haze on the horizon. We had jus tone other visitor in our car, and wonder how they can even break even.thankfully the commentary was short and to the point, but a good supply of illustrated maps adequately pointed out all the landmarks all around us.",,,
,,Brilliant views of Singapore,5,,"It is easy to get to and the queues do not appear to be hectic. We were lucky to have good weather, so we had magnificent views of Singapore and surrounding area.",,,
,,Fantastic Views of the City and Waterfront,5,,We were fortunate in that we didn't have to queue for long to get on this Ferris wheel which is well located on the edge of the shore overlooking Singapore Roads. The cost is reasonable in my opinion when compared with other iconic big wheels such as the London Eye.,,,
,,Worth doing,4,,"A good experience, nice ride and views are very good. Go in the early evening for a nice view. Price is reasonable.",,,
,,Truly a flying experience ...,5,,"View the whole of Singapore from this flyer... It's a fantastic experience.
At the night... In the evening the lights of the streets, buildings and restaurants give a amazing view of the city.
While in the day the ships on one side of the city provides a completely different view.
Of all the best experience comes if it's the F1 experience and you are on the flyer",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"This ride provides amazing views of the city. The capsule you ride in, is spacious and provides plenty of room to move around to capture a myriad of photos.",,,
,,Top of the world- fine dining.,3,,"If you have the kind of money to book a dining in the flyer, you should do it. I didn't but it might be worthwhile to do so as it does take you to the top of the world- at a snail's pace. I will not rate the flyer as a must-do in Singapore but it does look great in the city-skyline. As an alternative, the budget traveller may try the Tiger Sky Tower in Sentosa for a lesser price- if it is only to see the city from the top and nothing more.",,,
,,Great View,3,,"The closest MRT is Promenade.
The ride is for 30 minutes (one round) and allows you to see the city from great heights. The view is magnificent.

The charge is S$33 per head. They also have a special cabins on the flyer where they serve champagne.",,,
,,Amazing fireworks view on Singapore National Day,5,,"Although I have been on the flyer before, this time was different as we were able to see the fireworks that followed Singapore National Day Parade from the Singapore Flyer. Please note that senior citizens (of all countries) do get a discount here",,,
,,Must do!,5,,We did the Singapore flyer around about noon. Was a fantastic way to see the city. It takes around 40mins to do a full loop and you get to see everything. I loved it.,,,
,,Just wow!,5,,This would have to have the best views of Singapore. At night it is a spectacle of city lights and the Gardens by the Bay light show is fabulous from up there. Even the walk up to the pods is a spectacle in itself.,,,
,,Awesome,5,,"Been to Singapore flyer.,Found it brillant can see for miles and the views are great. Althoughi am not lover of heights this was one that didn't give that horrible feeling. The viewer breath taking and staff at the flyer were polite and talkative which was lovely. I ve had aexcellent holiday in lively beautiful Singapore. Would recommend the island a must visit.",,,
,,Great views of ever-changing Singapore,5,,"Did this as one of the many free attractions offered as part of Singapore Airlines stop over package. Capsule goes round slowly doing one revolution and is air conditioned. A great view of the ever-changing landscape, especially the new Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Bay Sands complex and the hundreds of ships beyond in the sea.

We did this first on arrival in Singapore then caught nearby MRT to the Marina Bay Sands complex - can walk from there to Gardens by the Bay (or $2 shuttle between Marina Bay complex and Garden Domes if you find walking in the heat too much).",,,
,,Excellent view - a must do,5,,"The line for the Flyer is always long, so we upgraded to the M枚et ride, meaning that we were put in a lounge, got a glass of M枚et on the trip, and had our cabin all to ourselves! I really can recommend that!!",,,
,,nice aerial view of city,4,,"Nice aerial view of singapore city, slowly the flyer moves. at starting of flyer it feels good. But after some time you get bored as you have seen the city now from top and wanted to come down after few clicks from your camera. but nice experience over all. ticket was for 20SG.",,,
,,A Good View from the Top,4,,"I thought I would be scared, but the trip was very slow that you barely notice the climb. Perhaps it would be scary if it was the daytime, but since it was night, the view fron the top was fantastic! If only the price was not too expensive. But for a one-time experience, it was OK. And, aside for the ride, we got to see a bit of the history of the flyer.",,,
,,"great views, tad pricey",3,,"Night views here are pretty spectacular, and offers plenty of photo op. You can really see the cityscape lit up beautifully. Only thing to lament is the ride is a little long.",,,
,,Up in the air,5,,A claustrophobic and a vertigo sufferer ventured on the flyer to be overawed by a great experience. The Grand Prix track was being built and this gives a fabulous view of everything. Recommended,,,
,,If you have extra time only,3,,"A good view of Singapore, but you can get a better view from Marina Bay. It is slow and boring, so visit if you have extra time and nothing to do. Visited in Aug 2014 with family.",,,
,,"Great views at night, a bit expensive",4,,"Include the Singapore flyer into your itinerary. The Singapore skyline at night is a picturesque city view, and the 30 minute ride is more than enough to take in the views and relax.

After a full day of walking, getting in one of the spacious pods of the Flyer is a welcome respite to end your night. You can spend your time keeping quiet, taking pictures, and/or chatting with your friends/family while the scenery changes as you go up and down the observation wheel.

If you get to the Singapore Flyer before it closes (11PM), then you're more likely to have a cabin all to yourselves. Usual capacity is around 20+ people, I think.",,,
,,very clean... great view,4,,This was a great ride. It went for 30 mins which was just the right amount of time.... not too long and not too quick. Had we known we would have gone in the afternoon for high tea.. The was a fantastic view of Singapore,,,
,,Great way to see Singapore,4,,Smooth operation of accessing flyer. Clean and easily accessible. We caught a bus there and a taxi to Gardens of the Bay for $5.,,,
,,nice place to get a birds eye view of singapore,4,,visit this place to see singapore from a good height....choose a clear day to visit.try to do this at the start of your trip.,,,
,,On A Clear Day You Can See Forever,5,,"You may be singing this song if it is a clear day. The Singapore Flyer is a wonderful addition to the Singapore skyline and a fun activity for the entire family. The gondolas are large and comfortable with seating well away from the windows if that's more comfortable for you. Go during the week and in the day time to avoid the crowds. This ride is very similar to the London Eye and other giant Ferris wheels being erected in major cities around the world. Go and see it.

...and keep on pedaling!",,,
,,High price flyer,3,,This is a hit or miss attraction. I think it is a bit pricey for the experience. Might be nice to do at night as a romantic activity,,,
,,"Great views, we'll worth the $23. TIP - go at sunset",5,,"We went at around 7pm and managed to get a view from above at daytime, at dusk (too cloudy for sunset) and then the city lights as it got dark. The Gardens by the Bay all lit up with its giant trees and Chinese lanterns was a sight to see. There is a fantastic view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which in itself is a sheer feat of modern engineering. It's 40 minutes for one rotation and take extra camera batteries, ours died after the first 2 photos and the iPhone pics do not do the Singapore skyline justice.",,,
,,Must see,5,,"Great view of Singapore. Worth the cheap tickets. Takes only 30 minutes and gives you a tour from the air. If you are in Singapore for a short time, I would recommend this activity over others.",,,
,,Nice view but average experience,3,,"One of the attractions that is worth a visit for the great views and photos over the city. You really do get to see everything from the marina, F1 track, skyline, sunset etc.
The only downside is once you reach the top, the journey down is just a waste of time and for SGD 32 P/p seems a bit expensive compared to rooftop bars where you can have a drink and still get great views.",,,
,,Beautiful view of Singapore,5,,Wow.. flyer gave us a very good experience and showed us the beautiful view of Singapore. Most enjoyable. And memorable. An awesome experience. :),,,
,,Well worth it!,5,,Really cool views of Singapore. Definitely worth going on Singapore's version of the London Eye! Go early in the morning to avoid the rush!,,,
,,Good view weather permitting!,4,,"Price is OK, duration is enough to have a good look in the city and surrounding area, its spacious for up to 15 people and can get good views for pictures. Besides that its a great piece of engineering...",,,
,,very nice ride,3,,go there at night or close to sunset use the mrt promenade station nice experience you will remember it forever smooth ride,,,
,,Nice view if clear sky,4,,"a little pricey. very nice view and wide scenery. but maybe should also check the weather, if it's haze or raining heavily, than better come again some other time..",,,
,,"I say you do it, but you'd regret it",3,,"I was so excited to take a ride of Singapore Flyer but I was slightly disappointed when it was done. Although during the ride, I could see the whole Singapore city and it was amazing view. I took a lot of pictures which I sure cherish. But realizing I paid handsome amount for just 1 round is pretty expensive. Well Singapore is all expensive for sure.",,,
,,Loved the Singapore Sling Flight,5,,We arrived early for our booked flight and ended up with the whole capsule to ourselves. The grand prix was three weeks away when we were there and clearly you get a great view of the track from the flyer - don't know if it will operate over that weekend though?,,,
,,Birds eye view,5,,Amazing place to visit see all of Singapore in one revolution It's goes very slow so everyone can do this Service from staff very attentive Would do this again,,,
,,Must experience,5,,"I have an acrophobia and never dare to expose myself to heights. But this giant wheel was amazing. Its slow motion made me not to notice that it was turning.

I've got an excellent view of SG. We took the ride in the evening and it great.",,,
,,You have to do this.,5,,"We booked the 7pm Champagne Flight. I watched as other passengers were sent through the mall to the entrance (so i knew where to go). However we were taken up in the lift, passed the queue and had a 'pod' to ourselves. A glass of Moet, a strawberry and a chocolate each was on the lit up seats. It was daylight as we started our trip (and you don't feel any movement) and dusk as we reached the top. One of the highlights of the trip to Singapore and a cherished memory. We wondered around looking at the stunning views, music playing, drinking champagne. It was magic. In the dark our 'pod' was lit up and that just added to the effect. As we left we were given two little Moet ball candles to keep. Wonderful. I would do this again.",,,
,,Nice ride,4,,"Singapore flyer. Is like a giant ferris wheel, made of an air conditioned capsule that can accomodate 28 passengers, and it's very safe. The ride is soft and smooth that could last approximately 30 minutes. It's relaxing to catch a glipse from above, it's a spectacular panoramic view of singapore. A must in your itinerary.",,,
,,Regret waiting so long before doing this,5,,"This is an absolute must-see for visitors to Singapore. We've been here a few years and I've never been, expecting it to be a little ""touristy"" like many of the local attractions. I went with my wife and mum on her visit and it was one of my most memorable Singapore experiences. The views are simply breathtaking. We chose to go late afternoon just before sunset for good light for photo's and were not disappointed. I imagine the evening views must be fantastic, but with the daylight on a rare clear day we could almost see the whole of Singapore. I will be a frequent return visitor. The photo's they took of us were a little goofy (like a typical American theme park) but we bought them anyway for the memories.",,,
,,Easy but expensive way to have 360 degree view of Marina bay,3,,"As a observation wheel fan, I did enjoy the journey of the flyer without doubt, terrific city view, the largest one in the world...etc. However, let's be more objective, it is pricy for sure. The view is really good but we just went to 1 altitude the day before coming the flyer for the view too and it was even higher than the flyer in terms of altitude. So the view we enjoyed while during the flyer journey, it was not that ""wow"" anymore. That also means you have other alternatives for sure to enjoy view of Marina bay unless you are like me, a observation wheel fan. The terminal was not easy to find, I don't think they make the sign clearly enough to make tourists understand because there are three level retail building. It was nice to have multi- media to be interactive with tourists before boarding. Most of them are not only entertaining but also informative. Souvenir is the most disappointing part! I could not find anything with quality to shop as a souvenir for my self or for families. Staff in promotion department really should go check other similar places then they would realize how much they can improve. I finally picked nothing before I left the souvenir shop. Food court underneath the flyer is great! Recommend to try something to end this stop!",,,
,,A must do!,5,,"DO NOT pay for the overpriced ""butler"" service/dinner - but DO go at night! views are spectacular and at 8pm you can see the light/water show on the marina bay.",,,
,,singapore view at its finest,5,,"while dining, you'll get relaxed to see the singapore 360degrees perspective. the view is so awesome you cant eat well hahaha!",,,
,,"Very slow, the view aren't that good",2,,The flyer was really slow and boring. The view wasn't stunning at all. It's better to see the city from Marina Bay Skycity or go to the 1altitude bar!,,,
,,"Go for the ride, go on to the next activity",3,,"The stores around the flyer are so-so, but the ride on the Flyer itself is definitely a seen-it-once-seen-it-all thing. It looks better than the first time I rode it with the addition of the Gardens By The Bay instead of a mudflat, but it's not something I'd come back for a second round.",,,
,,Good way to relax & get an overview of city,4,,If you haven't done this its worth the experinece. There are only a few 'flyers' in the world and this one that overlooks Singapore and gives a totally different perspective is worth the try.,,,
,,Amazing View,5,,"From the top, you can see almost the whole city of Singapore. Better to go there late afternoon to get a view both during the day and at night when lights are on. its good that we got a discount from Cebu Pacific. Just show the boarding pass. The whole compound of the Flyer is the hub of Hop on Hop off buses. There's a hawker center on the ground floor to try local food. From the flyer we just walked to Marina Bay Sands",,,
,,Fantastic views of the city,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is apparently the biggest wheel of its kind in the world. It certainly is very, very high up at the top! The movement is very smooth, the cabins air conditioned and not crowded, with plenty of seats for the lily livered like me to cling on to with eyes tight shut. Those who trust the technology can get some amazing views of the city and far beyond. It takes about 40 minutes to go round. If you have flown with Singapore airlines, take your boarding pass or ticket and get 20% discount. Lots of scientifical stuff to entertain you on the way in (or in the queue if there is one - not on the day of our visit).",,,
,,Amazing way to see Singapore!,5,,"We had one night on a stopover in Singapore and having done the night safari before decided to check out the Flyer. It was well worth the price and our kids, aged 7 and 5, loved it.
Gave us the most incredible birds eye view of the city. We ate downstairs, a bit too touristy for my taste, but certainly convenient and good introduction to Asian food for the kids.
If you just have one night in Singapore, would definitely recommend this.",,,
,,Flying High,5,,"An afternoon trip on the Singapore Flyer in beautiful sunshine was a fantastic way to see the panoramas of the city, the bays including Sentosa Island. The Flyer machine is of excellent engineering quality, large and each compartment has a wide comfortable bench seating. The numbers of visitors allowed are strictly limited so no crushes and pushing occur and everyone gets clear views across Marina Bay and in all directions. The complete rotation takes about an hour and it is possible to obtain special turns with champagne or wine included. This is a definite 'must-do' for any visitor who wants to see the impressive city laid out across the bays and the wonderful skyline in the central business district.",,,
,,Great views over city,4,,We went at night not sure of cost as we had a comp ticket.gets quite cold up there.the structure itself is amazing.the eye turns real slow and at times you don't even think you are moving.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Nice view. Clean capsule. Superb service. I like the museum showcase before you enter the Flyer. Centrally located.,,,
,,Great view,4,,"This is a great view of this city, the harbour and surrounds. The wheel turns slowly you hardly know that you are moving. Great photo opportunities.",,,
,,bigger than the london eye,5,,"a lovely experience, great views over the city and the water. you can get joint city tours and flyer tickets that work out great value. make sure you hop off the tour at the botanical gardens they are amazing. if you can stand the heat and humidity the garden are a lovely place for a picnic",,,
,,Engineering Marvel - Giving best views of Singapore!,5,,"It was an amazing experience to hop-on and hop-off from the continuously moving wheel!

We were lucky that we got a cabinet with only 4 of us, so it felt like a private cabinet booking at no extra cost. We were smart enough to get the tickets at a cheaper rate (~40% less ~ S$22) from Chinatown compared to the price at the tourist ticket counter at the flyer.

The entry to flyer is through a museum kind of place which captures all the engineering info related to the flyer, once you board the flyer the views of Singapore were breath taking.
In broad daylight we could enjoy the view of marina bay and the nearby Islands, it was really pretty!

Really liked the picture clicked by Picture Air team, it was a fab picture and we bought all the 6 six combos including the soft copy for ~S$60.
The wheel takes ~30mins for the full rotation and you don't even feel anything while the cabinet is moving at a steady pace.

A Must place to visit while in Singapore!",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Great views. Half hour long ride 65 metres high (second tallest Ferris wheel in the world) choose a clear day or night if you want good photos. You can see a spectacular view of Singapore in Lights at the night time rides.,,,
,,Day or night,5,,"This was my second trip of the wheel, this time in the daytime. How to choose day or night, being familiar with Singapore the day time experience was made up of spotting landmarks we knew, On the previous night time flight it was about enjoying the spectacular feel of the lights. On balance the night night time was the best. Either way it is a must do experience.",,,
,,Fantastic view!,5,,"What a great way to get a birds eye view over Singapore! The capsule is very spacious with plenty of room to walk around and get a 360 degree view. Like everything else i experienced in Singapore it was very well organised & immaculately clean. There was no waiting time to enter the Singapore Flyer, bought our reasonably priced tickets $33 i think, then we walked straight on. I would highly recommend it when in Singapore!",,,
,,Have the Ride on a Bright & Cheery Day,3,,It depends on the day and weather when you take the ride. Mine happened to be on a hazy day and I couldn't see much except wait for the ride to be over. I'll definitely try another ride when the weather is fine or when I can see the bright lights of the city!,,,
,,Singapore Night View,3,,"Visited the flyer at the evening, access to the flyer seems efficient (not much waiting time). Perhaps might be due to we visit on Friday evening, not much tourists. The ride is quite slow giving more than sufficient time to enjoy the view of Singapore. However, ensure you have companies, else looking at the same view for 30 minutes in slow pace is kind of boring as well.",,,
,,Fly High,4,,We went there during weekday so very minimal waiting time. Great experience. Nice view of Singapore from above. But quite far from the nearest train station (or I got there from a wrong train station?),,,
,,WOWWW !!!,5,,"Much better than London Eye, Singapore Flyer is an ideal place for tourists. Mesmerizing, the flyer never stops.",,,
,,First time on a big wheel,5,,We took the MRT to the Singapore Flyer during the week and there were only one other couple in the capsule with us. It is the best way to see the Marina Bay area of Singapore. The views up there were beautiful and it took about 30 mins and $33 per adult to enjoy this privilege.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"Quite an impressive trip, especially if one takes it close to sunset.The queues can at times be prohibitive, but I have not yet found the algorithm of how to beat them.",,,
,,Pricey and not sure to see anything,3,,We went several times on the Singapore Flyer. Kids will like for sure. Each cabin has air con so you will not suffer of warm weather. If you are lucky you can see Indonesia island. But honestly I prefer to see Singapore from the top of MBS or from other building. So it's not my preferred place. It's pricey. Don't stay there for meal...,,,
,,Wonderful,4,,The Singapore Flyer was a very nice experience. It takes 30 minutes to make a complete circle. The view from the flyer is wonderful. WE had a lovely time here. A must to do well in Singapore.,,,
,,It goes round,3,,The view is ok and the whole tour is smooth with efficient staff. You get to see over the bay but other vantage points are available. Underneath it is a mock-up of the street trader food stalls.,,,
,,Amazing Views,4,,"Singapore flyer will give you breathtaking 360 degree panoramic views of the city. Although I don't like heights, you are enclosed in a glass car versus open air as many Ferris wheels are so no worries. You must visit the flyer when in Singapore.",,,
,,Great Overview of Singapore,5,,"Clean and professional, with great views to look over the city It takes aroun 30 minuts and is well worth it",,,
,,A must visit in Singapore,5,,I visited there with my family in the evening. Awesome view of the city in the night. It was about 30 minutes smooth ride. One of the attractions can enjoy with out age barriers. We all enjoyed a lot. It was very safe and capsule was air-conditioned. We all had a great time.,,,
,,Great View,5,,"Loved the view, must visit!!, at the top you can see gardens by the bay, Singapore cities and the F1 race track.",,,
,,A well organised attraction,5,,"Great views, plant of room, well organised and if you needed to wait in a line (which we didn't) there were attractions along the way to keep you entertained.",,,
,,Nice view,4,,"When we reached the top there is a message saying you have reached the top of the world. Bit of an exaggeration when you are still looking up at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and city sky scrapers. But was a very well organised, slick machine. Staff helpful, the gondola we were in was very clean and the view is pretty spectacular. The cost was alright but certainly as a spectacle wasn't a deal breaker one way or the other. Happy to say have been there, a piece of engineering excellence. Little tip, after finishing if you want some very tasty, well cooked, while you wait Asian food at a really cheap price buy something to eat at the base in the 'food hall'. I bought Khay teow (excuse spelling) and my wife did satay with a couple of icy cold beers Very Yum.",,,
,,Relax and view Singapore,3,,"A nice way to leisurely see Singapore from a birds eye view.
We were lucky to go at dusk and have fireworks go off during our ride.
No sense of movement it just is one very slow continual rotation of the wheel.
Could be boring for some - especially kids
Some of the best food we experienced in Singapore at the food vendors on the bottom floor underneath the Flyer- very inexpensive too - we ate for $5 each for a decent size meal.
Other attractions within the same area e.g. 6D Theatre and Fish Spa",,,
,,City view from above,4,,"We reached the city on a hot day in April 2014. Following our visit to the zoo on earlier evening and the Marina beach n Botanics on the following day we reached the flyer. The panoramic view of the city from above gives a glimpse of the township. Most amazing, to me, was the curved building-scape and the floating soccer ground. The famous marina beach also could be identified from the flyer.
After coming down from the flyer we reached Santosa island and amongst other things was the ropeway ride, marine museum and last but not the least was the Sea by night song and dance programme with a sweet story to share.
We returned home with a sweet memory of the island.",,,
,,A must see with Breathtaking Views,4,,"There are only 3 of these in the world!
This is a great way to all of the beauty of Singapore. We took out ""flight"" in the morning.
Had we had enough time we would have gone at night but in some respects I'm glad that we did this during the day.
This was one of the activities that we used out i-venture card for.",,,
,,Expensive but worth it,5,,30 dollars is a bit expensive but the view is very nice and it takes at least 30 minutes to finish one round.,,,
,,Panoramic view of Singapore from the Flyer,5,,You can have an excellent view of the entire Singapore from the Singapore Flyer. Good to visit during the night. You can even see some parts of Malaysia from the Flyer during the day time. It鈥檚 one of the best attractions in Singapore,,,
,,360 views !,5,,"Came here in early july with my partner, decided to go do the flyer on our first night before going for a drink at the marina bay sands bar up the top. When we got to the flyer the weather wasnt to bad but because of lightning they said that they temporarlly stopped the flyer to wait for the lightning to pass, we thought we would be waiting all night but 5mins later they announced it was open and we went up and what a view! You can hire a complete pod to yourself and have a dinner or drinks but we decided not to go with that option and our pod wasnt too packed with people so we could easily move around to take photos of all the city. Fantastic! If your into mini rides we went on a 4D ride thats in the same building after being on the flyer.. That was fun too! Overall well worth the money and a must see :)",,,
,,Great experience,5,,Stunning views of Singapore city and the marina bay area including the hotel and gardens by the bay. We paid $33 each. For couples they have the option of having a drink and having a special cabin for yourselves for a very small extra fee which ends up being a good deal. We had the chance to see the sunset this time but maybe it would be better to go at night.,,,
,,Giant Look..But Little Fun...,3,,"Guys the time u look the flyer from a distant view... You will be amazed and will think that nothing could be taller to give a snapshot of the beautiful city... The only fun you will get is when u reach the top of it... but when u see MARINA bay sands nearby... U will regret coming on flyer and will wish tat u could have skipped the flyer and preferred going at roof top of Marina Bay sands.. its higher than Flyer and more centrally located and give a better view...

No doubt the experience of choosing flyer was good... but not the best...

its an approx 25 mins ride and the fun fades away in fist 10 mins... choose rationally.. good luck..",,,
,,"Slow, boring and expensive",3,,"Although the views may make the Flyer unique, the price point isn't something that will make it memorable.

Similar to any other ferris wheel, the Singapore Flyer is slow to rotate fully and is often crowded during the evenings. The price point may dissatisfy some people and the same view can be seen from the SkyPark observatory at Marina Bay Sands for free if you were to visit the rooftop bar.",,,
,,Its a good attraction................Good Photo opportunity,4,,"We visited it at about 5.30 pm, but I feel the night views around 7 pm should be nicer.

First go through Journey of Dreams - a multimedia showcase. Then boarded on to the Flyer cubicle. They just randomly send the guests into the Cubicle. As we boarded around 6 pm, there was no rush, hence we shared the cubicle only with a couple of peoples.

The Flyer moves slowly and it really gives a lot of photo opportunities, apart from an experience. Its a good experience if you have the youngsters with you. The entire time at the Flyer should be around 60-80 minutes.

I had a discounted ticket, but its not worth the original price of S$ 30. My view is that Sands Skypark would be better at S$ 23.",,,
,,Definitely not a must see,2,,"We went on the flyer because we purchased the Singapore Pass which included admission on the flyer. This is basically a copy of the London Eye, only a little bit bigger so they can say it's the largest in the world. It was ok, yes it went around in a 30 minute circle and we went high up, but it was actually kind of boring. You can get better views going up a tall building in the Marina Bay area (lots of buildings have bars/restaurants high up where you can go look out for free). Also, if buying admission instead of the bundled packages, it's really quite expensive. If it isn't completely clear skies, you wont be able to see much anyways.",,,
,,Fabulous city view !,4,,Very impressive as an outing as it is an outstanding view of the city. We went at dusk and it was beautiful as lights came on. Fairly steep price-and be aware that the family package only includes one child.,,,
,,Best to visit in the early evening at half past six,4,,"Scenic and good view of the surrounding Garden By the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, and surrounding. Best to visit in the evening around half past six, when the sun is just about to set and the city lights come on. Very beautiful.",,,
,,"Gorgeous view, Amazing atmosphere",5,,"We did the Singapore sling flight at 9pm on a clear Friday night in August.

We had pre booked the flight on the internet before leaving Australia and all we did was arrive and give them our name and we were asked to take a seat in the flyer lounge. It took around 15 mins and hen we had a gentlemen take us and another two ladies up to the flyer bar before heading out and skipping quite a reasonably long queue, to go to our private capsule. Only the four of us were in there, the lights were dimmed, there was soft music playing in the background and there were two seats with a small table ledge to put our drinks on. We were each handed a Singapore sling and then we started to ascend to the top. The view for the first 15 minutes it's fairly boring as you are looking out towards the ocean, however on the decent the view makes up for it looking onto Marina Bay is amazing and we stared in awe as we went descended back to the boarding platform.

The rotation is only half an hour which is perfect not too long and not too short.",,,
,,30 minutes ride,4,,"Very smooth. If there is a queue for the ride, they have several interactive activities to keep you entertained. Good view from the top. Good time to go is just at sunset to watch the lights come on in Singapore.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Super views. Decent price. More than just the flyer to see and do- lovely indoor garden area, eating places and part of the F1 track to walk around!",,,
,,Pricey views over Singapore,3,,"If you鈥檝e been to the London Eye, this is the same thing, only in Singapore. Giant ferris wheel, great views of the city, very slow (about 30 minutes for one rotation), very expensive (about $33 Singapore dollars). They have a very mediocre 鈥渟how鈥?as you make your way from the entrance to the wheel. Apparently you can also spend a bunch of money to have a butler serve you dinner in one of the cars, which I imagine would be a nice different way to celebrate a birthday or anniversary. But for just a tourist visit, I would say save your money and find a hotel nearby where you can go up to the top and see the views for free.",,,
,,wonderful experience,5,,"We did the Singapore Flyer during day time . It was a wonderful experience to see all the places with a 360 degree view . During day time we were able to see all the nearby islands , which are not visible during night .",,,
,,birds 'mega' eye view of singapore,5,,"Awesome view of city of singapore, all along 360 degree panoramic view , spacious transparent capsule takes you smoothly, providing view of marina bay , high rise bank and hotel buildings gardens by the bay, esplanade, harbour view little farther, right time is to choose dusk, to have late evening and well illuminated night view of amazing city",,,
,,A must to visit when you are in Singapore,5,,"Singapore Flyer was the World's largest Observation Wheel till March 14. Understand this this Flyer was opened for Public during March 2008. This Flyer lifts us 165 m into the Air. It provides us the Panoramic view of Beautiful Singapore City, Waterfront, Sky Line Buildings etc..
The movement is very slow and smooth and as such it fits all age group. The ride is around 30 minutes. It has 28 capsules and seating capacity is 28 passengers per capsule. Dine and Eateries are available in Level and 1 and 2. There are many restaurants and shops for Souvenirs.
You can reach this Flyers from MRT Station 'Promenade"" also. This is in Raffles Place.
As this Flyer moves very slowly, we can take pictures of the sea, skyline buildings and the surroundings with ease.
I suggest that the visitors may select to visit this Flyer at night time, to have a very spectacular view of Singapore city.
The Entrance Fee is around SGD27/- which I feel is reasonable.
Please don't to miss this Flyer when you visit Singapore.
We really enjoyed this amazing Flyer.

e",,,
,,Best fun 165mtrs up,5,,"""On top of the world"" is what the Flyer announcement says when you reach the top. The view is spectacular. This is the highest flyer in the world. $78 for family of two faults and a child.",,,
,,Daughter loved it,5,,We thoroughly enjoyed this adventure and great view Really get to see fantastic views and marvelous picture taking Definitely not frightening and extremely safe A must for Singapore,,,
,,"Had a stopover at Singapore Airport, so went into city for a few hours",3,,A good view of the city but not cheap at $33 per adult. A good photo opportunity. Would be hard to keep small childrens attention,,,
,,Amazing views,5,,A great way to get some good photos of the city. The night views are spectacular. The Flyer moves at a pace that makes photography unrushed.,,,
,,Good experience but bit expensive,3,,"Bought the tic online @SGD30++, cant rmb the exact amount.
U wil have to check in with ur tic first.then u will come to an area for u to take pics.n then u will queue for ur flyer.one cubicle can accomodate like 10persons.n u can help each other to take pics :)
View is gd esp at night. I went in the evening.so can still enjoy part of night view.however I think the price is bit costly.",,,
,,Well worth it,5,,"Another great experience in Singapore. Well worth taking the Flyer for great views, especially a roof-top view of Gardens by the Bay.",,,
,,Ms,5,,It was great to see the view of singapore marina pay and the city hall I love to see like this on daffrent contry,,,
,,Amazing views,5,,I visited in the daytime. Really nice views of Singapore. Worth every cent. The flyer coach was spacious and slow moving so it did not feel like a ferris wheel.,,,
,,overview of singapore in a nutshell,5,,Its brilliant to take a birds eye view of Singapore. We had the ride during day time. But I wish I had taken it during the night because Singapore skyline is amazing during the night,,,
,,Awesome view,4,,"We got to the flyer right on 8am for tickets and somehow managed to get the first pod for the day by ourselves as there was a tour group behind us who were all going on together.
Staff were pleasant and happy to chat to the kids.
The views from the top were brilliant. Definitely worth going on.",,,
,,A must do ride on the Flyer.,5,,Probably the biggest and best attraction ride that we could enjoy during our stay in Singapore. 30 minutes of unique viewing of Singapore city and port. Very high quality of equipment and operation.,,,
,,Overpriced....,3,,"Its OK to try the Singapore Flyer once, the view is quite good once you are on the top. However, it is a bit overpriced...",,,
,,Beautiful scenery,4,,we went onto singapore flyer at dawn. It's beautiful and could see the whole city of singapore central business area and marina bay :) I suggest people go there at sunset or at night to see city light,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Fantastic way to view Singapore and all it has to offer. Takes about 45 minutes to do the circuit, so sit back and relax and take in the view. If you have flown Singapore Airlines you get a discount with your boarding pass.",,,
,,Great Views,4,,"I went during the day and thought that the views were great. It's an enjoyable way of getting to see the layout of Singapore if like me you have not been there for a number of years.
I wished that I had gone at night but wasn't in Singapore long enough.
It wasn't a very busy day despite it being Sunday so no long queues.",,,
,,Singapore from the height / top,4,,if you love heights and wants to see the city from the top. It take you at the Top slowly and waits for some time so you can enjoy the entire Singapore from a great height.,,,
,,Just an average rated attraction,2,,"I did not enjoy this much as i am more of adventure. however, i recommend this attraction to photgraphers and those who like sitting down and looking around.",,,
,,Awsome,5,,"romantic atmosphere , beautiful views, a lot of attractions to see around the area but only seen few you need few full days to see every thing I just never had enough time but everything that I seen was worth it",,,
,,Nice ride,4,,"It is a once in a life time experience, there some stunning views to be seen on a clear day.

The kids (5 and 2) loved it but after the first 20 minutes they got a little stir crazy in the pod.

If you are going try to make sure there are not too many people in the pod with you, we were 4 and 2 others with us for the ride and that was very comfortable.",,,
,,Nice views of Singapore,3,,"We were glad we decided to ride the ""Flyer"" at night.

Excellent views. Plenty of room in the ""Pods"" to move around and take photos.

We went about 8.30PM. There was plenty of parking and queues weren't very long.

There is a discount when booking online. You don't have to select a specific time.",,,
,,Great experience,4,,"Was an amazing experience, so high n yet so safe, awesome view of the Singapore City, will enjoy especially when u r with your family....",,,
,,wonderful way to see Singapore,5,,The flight on the Singapore Flyer was excellent. It was a great way to see so many sights and to see where they are situated.,,,
,,lovely view,4,,"The view from the flyer is wonderful, we went at night. The only issue was the smeary windows from previous passengers. I guess it is a bit hard to clean the windows as they pass the ground staff without stopping. But wonderful views.",,,
,,Wow ... to see Singapore,5,,Very good experience to see Singapore from the Flyer.. Go there when there is no thunderstorm... as they close the flyer when there is one...,,,
,,Excellent well worth a visit,5,,We took a late evening trip on the Singapore Flyer and thoroughly enjoyed it. The wait time was minimal and the overall experience was excellent. The view of Marina Bay and the Singapore night skyline was fantastic. Highly recommended for a family,,,
,,Another romantic place in singapore that must be visited,5,,"when I'm here, I enjoy the surrounding scenery, if you are with family, friends, you better come up here early morning, I was with a friend at the time. after time is running out, I then asked the info for romantic dinner, and was able to be one of the places of interest.

warm regard's
ronny keff",,,
,,Good value,4,,Went during the day and you get a great perspective of Singapore. Would probably suggest time your trip for sunset and watch the lights come on across town.,,,
,,Great for picture taking!,4,,"An overview is an understatement. The Flyer moves slowly enough for you to take good pictures of the central business district, the skyline buildings, the waterfront and great views offered. Must try at least once.",,,
,,Great views from the biggest wheel in the world,4,,"Like the views, it is on the end of hop-on hop-off busses so hard to miss if you take these busses Found them too pricey",,,
,,Good View,4,,"It was as expected; clean, tidy, everything was in order. Bathroom was clean. Staff wasn't that friendly but acceptable and well manered. Inside the SIngapore flyer was also clean and the temperature inside was surprisingly perfect as it was air conditioned, not as hot as we thought it might be. The ride was long enough for us to enjoy the view, had some chit chat and day dreaming.",,,
,,"Great view, better than MBS observatory deck",4,,"It is not as new as Marina Bay Sands but personally, I prefer Singapore Flyer to Marina Bay Sands Observatory Deck.

Firstly, MBS is the latest visitor spot in Singapore downtown, from MBS Observatory Deck, you can鈥檛 see the MBS itself as you on the top of the building. Secondly and most importantly, barriers around the Observatory Deck is very high for safety reason, I didn鈥檛 enjoy the view there as much as I did at Singapore Flyer (with full glass windows) and I鈥檓 not quite sure if the younger (or shorter) kids can see much views. If you want to see city view and you have kids, just go to Singapore Flyer, it is safe, totally unblocked views with the glass windows, kids will be impressed.

I had been to MBS Observatory Deck twice - once at night and once during day time - I still prefer Singapore Flyer.",,,
,,Nice Views,4,,perfect for a late evening ride...so one can enjoy the sunset and the night views of the singapore skyline,,,
,,Great Views = Great Photos,5,,"The Singapore Flyer was a great attraction, slightly pricey but well worth it. Unlike its London counterpart, the capsules are not crowded. We visited at around 10AM on Sunday and there was no line to get in and they put only 10 people in our capsule. This allowed from great photo opportunities. After the ride, there were other attractions such as a 3D video and restaurants for those that were getting hungry.",,,
,,Flyer views are fantastic,5,,Great way to see the skyline in the Marina area. 30 minutes for the whole experience. We had the cabin to ourselves and couldn't even tell that we were in a giant Ferris wheel. Very smooth.,,,
,,Wow!,5,,"Despite the rain and drizzle, the views were amazing, and each pod is large enough to walk around and admire the city from every angle. Make sure your camera batteries are charged!",,,
,,Amazing,5,,"WOW WOW WOW

Its a must if you are visiting Singapore. The views are amazing.
!5pd or go for the champagne package for about 30pd.
This gets you a glass of moet, a chocolate and strawberry and 2 candles as souvenirs. Also vip entrance no queuing.
Normally 28 people in a capsule but believe only 8 on the vip packages. We were fortunate enough that there was only us 2 as no one as had booked at the same time.
Book 7pm for sunset. Don't forget your camera. Takes about 35 minutes. We wanted to go straight back on",,,
,,Beatyfull view,5,,Very nice attraction and have a spectaculair view over Singapore Very nice garden under it. In evening also possible to have diner here,,,
,,Wonderful Singapore Eye,4,,"I used to come to Singapore some times since the day it opened but I still want to go to more. The feeling of standing at the top of Singapore very cool. When the cable reach the top, you can see the boundary between Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. You can catch many interesting pictures when playing with skyscrapers of Singapore. Besides, the view around the cable is also very cool. Especially, you can save money and time if combine Duck Tour and Singapore Flyer by buying Combined Tickets. Singapore Flyer deserves as a Singapore Symbol",,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Breathtaking views, we rode at night and it was one of the most amazing things i have done. very well orangised..",,,
,,Great!,5,,"It was a really quiet day - just us and one other family in the pod. Got to see everything we wanted. We bought a combined ticket which included Flyer, Duck Boat, Bus tours (for 48 hours) it also included other things, which we did not have the time to do, but the combined ticket was well worth the money. Flyer was great.... just do it.",,,
,,Boring and expensive,1,,"Don't remember how much we paid, but it was quite a bit. Certainly regretted it. A very slow moving ferris wheel with views of the city (which you can easily see from any tall building in the area). Do it if you really need to kill time.",,,
,,On top of the World,5,,"WOW, this is a amazing experience, even if you are not fussed on heights the cabins turn so smooth you do not feel a thing. Just fo for the views.",,,
,,great views,5,,"a must do in singapore ,great views of the city/bay area also the f1 grandstands ,costs $33 per person and takes 30 mins",,,
,,Great views,4,,A little overprice but the views are amazing. If you have time well worth a visit. To give you a comparison it is like the London Eye but with better views . . . . . and nicer weather.,,,
,,cannot miss this,5,,worth a visit. The view just gets better . Best time is late evening with little bit of sun to take amazing pictures. As everything in Singapore the price is a bit too high but it cannot be missed !!!,,,
,,Not to be Missed !!!,5,,"A visit to Singapore is incomplete without Singapore Flyer. Try to get package deal if you are visiting with family. Usually the agents would charge you full. The view is breath taking. Take your tour guide along with you who can explain and give some history of the landscapes that you will see. The capsule itself is spacious and comfortable. It gives you a 360 degree view of Singapore.
This is something you should not miss.",,,
,,It was oaky,3,,"We did the flyer at night, so you had a good view of the lights of Singapore. After having done it we thought we would have been better to have saved our money, as it is S$33 per adult.

For us it was a so-so experience.",,,
,,Steady n fearless flyer,3,,It's unexpectedly stable n I'll say it's slow enough for all ages to ride on it. It gives magnificent views of the Marina Bay including the Gardens by the Bay n the Sands. You can also see the locations of the Merlion...,,,
,,getting high,4,,"I wanted to see the track for the Grand-Prix and this is the best way to see the whole track, also the view over this part of Singapore is fabulous, you can see over to the Marina Sands and across the harbor to the centre of the commercial part of town.",,,
,,avarage,2,,"you will see nice small park at the bottom, and buy souvenirs, however overpriced. i don't think its worth to see.",,,
,,Amazing views of the town!,4,,"After looking online and seeing mixed reviews visited the flyer with an open mind. Seems the consensus among locals was that it is a bit of a gimmick, a bit far out and expensive. I would have to disagree with all points as it was a short trip on the underground, was well put together as a whole complex with food and other entertainment and was comparable with the London Eye on price. We got to appreciate some amazing views along with part of the F1 circuit, the staff were polite and helpful but expect airport style scanners and searches prior to boarding.",,,
,,Great View and Experience,5,,"My wife and I rode on the Singapore Flyer and were impressed with the experience. We had decided that we were going to walk to Gardens on the Bay and spend some time exploring there. As we were walking towards Marina Bay, we thought that as it was a relatively clear day (not cloudless blue skies), that taking a trip on the Flyer might be a good option. We were pleased that we took the time to view Singapore from this vantage point.
The ride cost S$33 and took about 30 minutes. It was excellent value as you could see many of Singapore's landmarks during the ride. At 165m above the ground, it certainly gives you a different view of the city. The ride is smooth and the pods provide excellent views. The facility has the normal range of tourist shops, cafes and of course it is complete with the souvenir photo package. These things aside, the Singapore Flyer is worth doing if the weather conditions are reasonable. Spending an hour or so here is worth the effort.
Thanks for your vote if you found this review helpful.",,,
,,Great view,4,,My sister hsd a couple of tickets and decided to try it was a good experience and great view.Once is ok I guess.,,,
,,Overcoming fear,4,,"Singapore flyer, was very good
I have a fear of heights, but this felt very secure, in fact did not realize I was moving until it was pointed out to me I was half way round. Views of city........amazing.
Only negative, do not have singapore sling, as not very pleasant at all.",,,
,,Unbelievable,5,,"I was last year in London also riding the London eye - and was surprised, how great this 164m high wheel is: outlook gorgeous, you see the ships at the sea, the skycrapes, the river, wonderful unbeliebable great experience",,,
,,One of those things you should do!,4,,"If you can afford to, do this during the daytime, and do it again after dark. If you cannot afford to do it twice try and time your boarding 15 minutes before dusk & you will get to experience it 15 minutes after the 'lights come up', as a complete circuit takes about 31 minutes.

Greats views over the CBD, Bay, the new Gardens, and of course Marina Bay Sands.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Great views of Singapore, well organised attraction. I was worried that the carriages may be overcrowded but there was only 8 people with plenty of room to comfortably hold more. Would recommend.",,,
,,Excellent Views,5,,"This is a well run operation and it seemed only a few minutes after arriving that we were in a cabin and off on our 30 minute long ride. We arrived at about 10.30am before the rush and shared our cabin with only another couple which was good. We took turns taking each others photos with various views as the back drops.

The views are spectacular and it gives you another perspective of Singapore. It was so amazing to see so many ships waiting out in the harbour-looked like a scene from a WW2 war movie with all the ships waiting to unload. Well worth the fare.",,,
,,Fantastic views,4,,"Having queued over an hour for the London Eye, we were stunned to be able to walk straight onto Singapore's flier. Great views and photo ops at a reasonable price - would definitely recommend.",,,
,,Interesting Place to see,5,,"Interesting Place to see Singapore, nice small park at the bottom, and buy souvenirs, however overpriced.",,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,We thought being there over Chinese New Year and going at sundown there was no chance but to our surprise there was no queuing at all. I can only compare this to the London Eye but it is just as impressive and well worth a go. Amazing views across Singapore both new and colonial old.,,,
,,Lovely views,4,,Had great views from the top of the flyer. My only complaint would be the price which I felt was quite steep.,,,
,,Visit at least once,4,,"Not as amazing as London's Eye but it has its own charm. Better to visit when it's about to sunset, around 5.30 - 6.30 PM, then continue your trip to bisit Super Tree light show at Garden of The Bay.
The ticket is quite expensive, check out deals at Groupons or other online sites to get better deals.",,,
,,Boring .... & Pretty Expensive,3,,"Worth going up to take a look if you got cheap tickets. Up there, you will see the view of Singapore ... Best if you go in the evening so you could see the sunset!",,,
,,It's a MUST,5,,This is bigger than the London Eye. We took amazing pictures of our hotel which is walking distance to Pan Pacific Hotel. There are really nice restaurants/bars by the river where you can grab a cocktail.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer is a MUST,5,,"This Wheel is bigger than the London Eye and worth going on, the view around the area is just beautiful. You can get some amazing photo's of the Bay Garden, City and the river",,,
,,Stunning views,5,,"Was lucky to jump on the Singapore Flyer as the sun was setting.

Singapore is such a beautiful city! The views from the Flyer are incredible and Marina Bay Sands looks stunning while the sun sets.

Before you jump on the flyer you go through the pre-flight checks. Your bags and body are 'scanned'. Then there's lots of information about how the Flyer was built.

It was a lovely experience and I'd definitely go again.",,,
,,Unparalleled views,5,,The family loved this attraction. With a constantly changing vista the slow rotation didn't take any time at all. Great views of the marina bay and its unique hotel. Well worth the visit!,,,
,,Thump up,4,,"excellent view! can look up around the sparkling city especially at night time.Wonderful scene!I m going there once a month.I don""t ve any negative comment about singapore flyers.",,,
,,at the top,5,,if you wanna see Singapore in one shot try to be at the flyer. A conservatory wheel with a fantastic view from the top.,,,
,,One time thing,4,,There are many places in Singapore which give better view. This is more of a one time only thing. Spend 40 mins seeing Singapore from glass window. Bit expensive if you look at value for money. Could get very crowded sometimes and be prepared to spend time in queue.,,,
,,Lovely experience,5,,This was a wonderful experience. We chose to have dinner on the Flyer and it was well worth the price. We had the added bonus of watching the rehearsals for the National Day Parade and the fireworks!,,,
,,great view,5,,"my first time and is magical, try during sunset, is beautiful, great view and lights. love it!!! the whole experiance is magical. is worth it to brimg your family or your love one. :)",,,
,,There are much better places to see Singapore from,1,,"The daily trawl of tourists in coachloads from the package holidays, line up for a 'trip' in the Flyer. Unlike the superb London Eye, this similar looking wheel looks the same from the outside but on the inside offers a different experience. There is no guide to assist you as to what you are looking at, the air con is doing its best to keep you cool but struggles when you are in a sealed glass bowl on the equator and elevated nearer to the sun. Unlike the London Eye which is only surpassed by the Shard on height, you will spend much of the trip looking up at buildings as they are taller ! Several of these buildings also offer you free or cheaper access (except Marina Bay Sands which is $10 more). Also these other buildings offer refreshments, natural air and the option to go to the toilet if you've been over drinking water to keep you cool. Save time and money and do not even consider doing the very cheesy glass of champagne spin for $130. Rumour has it they are doing their best to repay the huge amount they spent on putting it up there. Finally, they put it in the wrong place. For a great view go to Altitude 1, OUE, Swissotel, UOB viewing floor or best of all Level 33 bar at the Standard Chartered Building.",,,
,,Great View of Singapore,4,,"If you want to have a great quick aerial view of singapore try the singapore flyer. We took it during day time so the view was quite spectacular.

Make sure you bring a small bottle of water - in case u get thristy. As there are no food or drinks available once u start the journey.",,,
,,Nice Experience,5,,"Book your tickets on-line, come in the evening, after 5:30. It will be not so hot, and you'll enjoy more",,,
,,A great treat!,5,,"We bought a ticket on the Flyer as part of a package deal. The type of ticket that we bought turned out to be the Singapore Sling/Cocktail ticket, and this really made the trip on the Flyer luxurious! We were escorted to our private pod on the Flyer, and were handed our drinks as we walked in. Apart from the fantastic views that we experienced on the Flyer, it was a great time to really take in all of what Singapore has to offer. In my opinion, it is worth spending a little extra (the Signature Cocktail or Dinner options) to get the luxurious experience!",,,
,,Flyer,5,,"Took a trip on the Singapore Flyer, it takes approx 25mins for the whole trip. Wonderful sights of Singapore a must see.",,,
,,"Up, up and away !",5,,Top way to get super views of Singapore and environs. Clean and well managed it was a thrilling way to take some great photos. Superb views of Marina Bay Sands Complex and Gardens of the World. Great for all the family and wheelchair friendly.,,,
,,A Must Try!,5,,"If you are looking for some kind of a ""roller coaster ride"" or some excitement that you feel when going to a theme park, then this is not the place where you should be. This is not your average ferris wheel. It's more of an observation wheel that lets you see and appreciate Singapore! But don't ever think that this is no fun at all... because it is! Kids and adults alike will surely enjoy the SG Flyer. Even those afraid of heights (like my mom) will forget all about their fear. The Flyer gives you a very good, if not best, view of Singapore --- it's skyline as well as the bay and garden views.

The trip takes about 30 minutes. It is highly recommended that you schedule your flight trip at around sunset.",,,
,,Brilliant!,5,,"We bought our tickets in the UK before we travelled and made a significant saving,went for the private Mo毛t Chandon capsule,which gave us a pre flight lounge then escorted to the flyer,Singapore slings included,choice of music,very spoilt! Views are amazing! Loved the whole experience,well worth visiting!",,,
,,"Great views, reasonably priced",4,,"Lots of good views of the city, from many angles as you would expect as you rotate around the wheel. many things to see and do around the base of the wheel too.",,,
,,Best thing in Singapore,5,,Must do great views. Bit of a line up to get on and then closed due to a thunderstorm! But we came back and enjoyed the ride... Very sedate and ok for those not liking heights!,,,
,,Great views,4,,"Humour me, I said to my husband....... We went to the Singapore Flyer via MRT, easy access and a short walk. We were asked for our ""Pensioner"" card - as tourists and being early 50's ...... My husband didn't know how to react when the tactless ticket girl said ""you are over 60!"" We declined and paid full price. Good views, however if you have been to the Marina Bay Sands Skydeck or even into one of the domes at Gardens by the bay, you really won't need to go. Maybe the Mo毛t or Singapore Sling Ride where you may not have a full ""carriage"" of noisy over excited tourists.",,,
,,Worth the money..,4,,This is a must while in Singapore.Outstounding views of the city and surroundings.Very well organised. Beware getting a taxi can be problematic especially in rain.,,,
,,Great experience with National day fireworks,5,,We went there a week before the national day. Really loved the fireworks and Singapore view from top. Must see for all Singapore tourists.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer - fantastic views over Singapore.,4,,"In July 2014 we indulged ourselves with 'High Tea' as we took a trip on the Singapore Flyer. We had a Waiter looking after us for the 30 minute tour and we were able to ask him any questions regarding the Flyer.There were only four of us so we could easily move around the capsule. Normally there would have been 8 passengers.
The views were fantastic and there was plenty of time to take photo's.
The staff were extremely helpful and approachable so if you have any questions just give them a call. Better if you pre-book this trip by phone or on line.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Great attraction. Reasonably priced. Amazing views across Singapore. An excellent pre ride museum which shows how the Flyer was made. Great choice of well priced street food available.

The ride lasts about 30 mins. Capsules are a good size and not overcrowded. Excellent photo opportunities of Gardens by the Bay, the F1 track, the Port, Marina etc.",,,
,,Luxury stuff. Really nice view of the city,5,,I went on with my family. Really liked the view from the top. It was clean and all the stuff were nice.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer & Universal Studios Singapore,5,,It is the seconde Largest flyer in the world from where you will enjoy the Singapore whil havind lunch or Dinner in the flyer...................... Universal Studios is amazing place to spend a fullday with your family or alone......,,,
,,Good for first time,4,,I've never been to any Giant Flyer before and my son has been to London Eye. Though I don't think it will give any thrill or experience but gives a quite good view of the City and If you are with family it gives you quite some time to discuss about the City and click some pictures. I think they should have provided some open window to take outside pictures.,,,
,,Need Audio guide for better experience,3,,"We visited Singapore Flyer in July 2014, and it was an awesome experience to be in a marvel like this.

What would help enjoy this ride more is (1) an audio tour kind of thing that explain what we see in which direction etc. or (2) make tour guides available to accompany tourists on the ride and explain different landmarks of Singapore, islands that we see from the top etc.",,,
,,Must do!,5,,To find out the flyer was bigger than the one in London had me intrigued. The tour takes 30 minutes and the majority of Singapore and its highlights can be seen. It provides a great overview of the city and how much is packed into a small space (approx. 500 km2). The cabins were clean and the windows allowed unrestricted views. Recommended.,,,
,,Birds eye view,4,,Ok. It's like a large ferries wheel. Try getting on board in the evenings. The view is excellent. Just pray hard it does not rain.,,,
,,sunset ride,5,,"The best time to go and hop on is just when the sun is about to set, you watch as the night approaches and the lights of the city come on.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"A bit more expensive then some but we got the bus ride all day as well
Singapore flyer had amazing views of harbour , gardens and the port with the thousands of ships
The capsule is a reasonable size as I was a bit worried about this and moves slow. After the flyer we got on the bus and went round Singapore getting off and on as many times as we liked",,,
,,Singapor flyer,5,,"This ferys wheel is just beside all the other attractions and gives you a great view of the harbour, gardens right into the distance with all the freightships. The cabins are air conditioned, which is very pleasant. There are restaurants and a small garden right down below.",,,
,,Dizzying Experience,4,,"Wow, you need to be there on this for about 45 minutes to share your dizzying experience. For starters, this flyer is the world's tallest observation wheel in the world !!! When you sit inside the a/c box and it starts moving, ever so slowly, you can have a mesmerizing view of Singapore on a clear, cloudless day. Fascinating experience. Enjoy it with your entire family, guys.",,,
,,On top of the world,5,,Great views Can get a little warm in the pod Hawkers centre below and plenty of choices and shops to have a look in,,,
,,Slow yet exciting,5,,"Loved the views of this ultra modern city , with so much construction one side and such beautiful structures which are end products, the view of Marina Bay Sands and the Golf course and the Sea is too good. There are dinning options if you are going with a loved one just to surprise them. I would be a good experience ;)",,,
,,Singapore Flyer - Best to try it at night ...,4,,"Very stable ride and it better to take it at night to see the night scenery of Singapore...

They also can book for dinner ride etc ....

If going to take it in the morning or afternoon, choose a day when weather is clear so can see all the way to Batam ...",,,
,,Amazing Sight even if you don't get on a ride.,4,,"Its a great place and the easily accessible by the MRT and a 5 mins walk. Should go there by the evening as the Flyer is all light up and looks amazingly beautiful. I was on a very tight budget trip hence could not get a ride on it. but went below it near the water and the sight was majestic.

will surely go back sometime for a ride not the flyer.",,,
,,The hype is fast ending,2,,"Too the Singapore flyer twice: once in the day and once at night. It was okay initially until we reached the top. It becomes an excruciating painful experience as it takes a while for the wheel to go down. Hence, it is enough for a local experience.",,,
,,Visit during night time,5,,You can view a fully lit Singapore from the height of 36 floors. Amazing experience. Moves very slowly that you don't even feel you are going up on a Giant Wheel. A must visit attraction in Singapore. Much bigger than London eye.,,,
,,worthwhile,4,,"Managed to book one of the private cabins for the two of us, along with cocktail. We booked this from the UK and were pleased to find not only a great cost saving but added VIP touch of private waiting area and private entrance to the cabon. Cant really comment on the view as i realised just after take off that i am not that keen on heights! However my partner assures me the view was specatcaular and well worth it!",,,
,,Not Worth to Spend on this Attraction,3,,"Singapore Flyer charges about 1600 INR. It is like a giant wheel with closed glass cabins. A single round takes about 45 minutes to complete.

Although view of Singapore is superb, it is exciting only for about 10 or 15 minutes. After that, it is boring.

We were about 20 people in single cabin. It was looking conjested, and hot. Did not enjoy at all. If you sit, other people block view. If you stand, you feel tired for standing 45 min.

If you are in short of time in Singapore, you can skip this attraction.",,,
,,WOW,5,,The Singapore Flyer was great.We went at night. The lights and lasers were amazing. It was well priced Worth while doing. We thoroughly enjoyed,,,
,,Great view across the city,5,,"Iconic Singapore attraction with fantastic views over the city, harbour, Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay.",,,
,,"Super viewing/photo op, well run",4,,"The well-paced ferris wheel provides excellent views of Singapore's old and new cityscape. And the glass was high-enough quality to permit the taking of very good photographs. The attraction was well run and not too crowded on a summer weekday. True to Singapore's math-y orientation, introductory materials did an impressive job of explaining the Flyer as an engineering achievement.",,,
,,"Nice views, nothing else",2,,"I was looking forward to Singapore Flyer, since I just love heights, excitement and good views.

If you're looking for excitement and fun (like I was), the ride with Singapore Flyer is not for you. If you just want to see the beautiful city skyline from high above, spend a good relaxing 30 minutes in a glass box with bunch of other tourist while feeling remarkably safe and cozy, you will probably enjoy it.

For the price we paid, I wouldn't recommend this experience.",,,
,,Fun way to see the city skyline,5,,This is a great way to get a view of the city and the surroundings. It's much like the London Eye and the new Ferris wheel in Las Vegas. Good family fun or if traveling solo and want to kill some time.,,,
,,Great Views,4,,"An excellent way to capture 360 degree aerial views of the city, Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay and the port.",,,
,,Not worth the price - don't go,2,,"The only reason we went was coz our young kids pestered us. It cost about SGD100 for a family of 2 adults and 2 kids which is MYR260 - probably enough for a 1 night stay in a 4 star hotel in Malaysia. Whole experience is over-rated, the museum attraction before entering was just average, flyer moves very slowly and the views are pretty much what we could already see from our hotel room. There was another family from India in the same capsule as us with teenage kids who kept saying it was boring and were playing on their mobile phone! Would NOT recommend this.",,,
,,Nice view before sunset,5,,"I choose to try it like one hour before the sunset. It was wonderful experience, and it was not so crowded, will get amazing view of the marina and as well as the see. I got beautiful pictures. It was nice also to know about the flyer itself, how it is working and how it was built.",,,
,,Note to all claustrophobes. You will be fine.,5,,"If you can use a typical building elevator, you will not have any problem with Singapore Flyer whatsoever. I have a slight case of claustrophobia (i.e. long and packed flights, seriously old or small elevators) so I was a bit apprehensive about being in a closed capsule for 30 minutes. The fact that the capsule was one with a view was my only consolation.

But as you can see from my pictures, the environment is quite spacious. There is room for passengers to move about and enjoy Singapore on all sides. In my case, effective air conditioning also helped. And the fantastic view kept me occupied throughout.

So if you suffer from claustrophobia, I hope you find this message an assurance of sorts. I believe you can tell the staff manning the capsule entrance you wish to wait for the next one with fewer passengers if necessary. Enjoy and safe travels!",,,
,,The view is very nice,4,,The view of Marina Bay & surrounding area is very nice. Its worth visiting this place at least once. The complete round is done in less than 30 minutes. You feel it should continue for some more time. The 360 degrees view of surrounding areas is nice to click some photos if you are visiting with friends & family,,,
,,"High Price, but Worth the View",4,,"While the $33 ticket fare was less than ideal, the view from the top was certainly worth it. The speed of the flyer is quite slow, so there's plenty of time for pictures as you go up and down. 100% worth the money!",,,
,,the great way to see singapore,4,,"we arrive there arround 6.30pm and it's a lucky time we can see singapore when the sun still until night, so we get great pictures. with singapore still with the sun and singapore at night time with full of lights.",,,
,,Good views of Singapore city,4,,"Singapore Flyer is a good way to see the city from high above. Obviously it doesn't compare with being on a helicopter ride or being in a hot air balloon. I went for a ride as part of a Singapore promotional event for foreigners living in Singapore. We were each given a nice lunch at the restaurant downstairs and then a refreshing cocktail drink in the Flyer whilst a wonderful Singaporean guide explained the history of Singapore to us which really enriched the whole experience for us. It's a quick 30 mins ride and easy to get to.

Give it a try. The rating above describes my experience of being on the Singapore Flyer with all the bells and whistles. Might not be the same without them haha",,,
,,Great view of Singapore,3,,"It's great to have a nice view of Singapore, such as the Marina Bay, the ship on the coast, the Gardens by the Bay.",,,
,,Lovely View,4,,"I wasn't aware, but there's a whole museum attraction thing before one enters the Flyer itself. It's a bit odd, but fun. There's also a mall beneath the Flyer. The cars are air-conditioned and very pleasant, and the few is quite nice at all angles. A fun thing to do, even if it's pricy.",,,
,,Flying High Singapore Style,5,,An excellent aerial view of the whole of Singapore. On a clear day you can see as far as Johore. Goes pretty slowly so you can take it all in from the large glass cabins. Highly recommend.,,,
,,A disappointment,3,,"We went at night as recommended. But the views were not that much better than from the Bay Sands Hotel. The main disappointment is that we can't see the Bay Sands from the front, only the side could be seen.",,,
,,whole Singapore in-front of our eyes..,5,,"its wounder full view.. i think in night it more beautiful.. colorful, exciting.. ,, we enjoy the time.",,,
,,Iconic attraction.,4,,"When in Singapore you really should do this at least once. Great views from this iconic experience. Of course there are ""eyes"" all over the world but this is one of the biggest.",,,
,,Singapore from above,4,,It's one of nice spot to see singapore from above. The city light at night is beautiful. They will take picture of you before you get in and you can buy that photo when you get off if you want (they will edit the background first).,,,
,,Flyer,4,,"I am afraid of heights, but felt quite secure in the flyer and do NOT regret the ride. A bit pricey (especially for a family of four) but worth it!!",,,
,,Not the best view here,3,,"Very much like London Eye.

It was fine, but loses in comparison with Marina Bay Skypark: there you don't have greasy glass to obscure the view and you are not limited in time to take in all fantastic views without moving up-down. And, yes, Skypark is higher (and cheaper)! :)))",,,
,,A View from the Top,5,,This is a Must See in Singapore. The cost is a bit steep at $33 Singapore. What a great view of Marina Bay and much of Singapore. The trip is once around and takes about 40 minutes. It is touted as the world's tallest Ferris Wheel. Also if you have been away from the States for a while there is a Popeye's fried chicken on the lower level. We were in Cambodia for a couple of weeks so we had our fill of Popeye's chicken when we finished riding the flyer.,,,
,,Not to be missed in Singapore,4,,Glad to have finally rode this attraction on my second time in Singapore since when we first visited this it was closed due to bad weather. It is best to ride at night time when the whole city lights up and you can take as many pictures as you like.,,,
,,A view to the city,5,,A must do on your visit to Singapore. Amazing 360 degree view of the entire country. Doesn't cost much and definitely within anyone's budget.,,,
,,Great View,4,,Standard price for any observation wheel was $33 about 拢16.. The views are spectacular looking over over marina bay and the river and the financial district.. There is nothing you can't see from other places though.. But worth a ride to say you have been on the worlds biggest wheel,,,
,,No fear,5,,"For all even if you do not like going on to roller coaster rides, one ride you acn easily go on. Do not miss it when in singapore. Gives you complete view of entire Singapore. Do not forget to make videos while it is moving.",,,
,,the best ride in my life!,5,,if you are in singapore u have to try the singapore flyer. singapore is such a beautiful city and you get the very best view from the top of singapore flyver. it is better that big ben in london! you will not regret it! worth the price,,,
,,Iconic ride,5,,"From a distance it is difficult to see the flyer move, but a full circle is only 30 minutes. I wanted to have a go mainly because it is an iconic part of the skyline and seeing the flyer in various images in the future will now remind me of the holiday without leaving me wondering what it's like. I got a ride in on my last day in Singapore and I'm pleased I made the effort. Totally worth it for the view. It's also pretty relaxing in what is otherwise a very full on place. I rode with my family during the day. My wife is uncomfortable with heights but was okay on this and the kids enjoyed it. Next time I will do a lap at night.",,,
,,Fantastic experience.,5,,Amazing views and took home some awesome photos. You can see most of Singapore from the top. I would recommend this to anyone.,,,
,,Around you go for a great view,5,,London Eye type experience but without the hassle. No street vendors to bug you. Great 34 minute experience,,,
,,Singapore Flyer- Great Experience,5,,"This is a must see attraction that will give you an ever adjusting view of downtown Singapore.
The size of the Flyer's compartments are spacious enough to enjoy the view with fellow travelers, and the speed of the Flyer allow you to easily pose for screen-saver pictures and/or take impressive ""selfies"".",,,
,,"Nice at night, just what you would expect",3,,"Really it is what you would expect. Well set us and a great view of the night sky. Queues were not to bad and moved through efficiently. Quite pricey for five, given people are deemed as adults post twelve years of age.",,,
,,A Circle Flying Observation,5,,"This was my first experience riding in an observation flyer. It looked great from beneath and even more spectacular from the above when you're in it. You have to buy a ticket of 33 SGD (about $28) for the boarding. Once you have boarded the flyer cabins which are wide and clean enough, you'll get a slow-moving panoramic view of the Marina Bay. From the cabins, you can have a great view of the Esplanade (Theaters by the bay), The Gardens By The Bay, The Helix Bridge, The Marina Bay Sands Hotel and last but not the least the MBS Art Science Museum. I would highly recommend anyone to hop into this to get a difference but yet unique experience in Asia. I would also recommend to buy food and drink from outside as they can turn out to be quite expensive in the lounges close by the attraction.",,,
,,Giant Wheel,5,,The first impression is amazing. The world's largest Ferris wheel in front of our eyes. Service staff was very friendly and pleasant. 30 minutes we sense enough to see Singapore as 360 degrees.,,,
,,Not as good as The London Eye,3,,Ticket prices for adults at the attraction cost $S33 each (July 2014). The sights are good but if you've been on any of the other sight seeing attractions or up a high rise building you're not going to see anything really mind blowing. Make sure you go when the weather is fine and clear otherwise you won't be able to see everything. We went during the day and we could see a long way. We were thinking of going at night but again all you're going to see is lights and you can do that from anywhere near Marina Bay. The staff aren't the friendliest people in the world either. If you've been on The London Eye I wouldn't bother as you'll be disappointed.,,,
,,Perfect View of the City,4,,"This is a must do in Singapore. It can be a little expensive but we purchased the iVenture pass so we were able to include this with other attractions. It was a perfect view of the city. We went in the morning, shortly after it opened, and there were no lines or waiting. It was a great way to start our time in Singapore.",,,
,,Highly Recommend the Singapore Flyer,5,,"We absolutely loved this attraction. We travelled as a family with 2 children. The entrance to the flyer was very informative with an interactive area that gave you details about the construction of the flyer and so much more.
The flyer took 30 minutes to do a full circle. The views are amazing! You can sit down or stand up, either way you'll enjoy the scenery.",,,
,,Great night time view,4,,"Took a ride on the flyer on a monday evening. Very few people in the cue, we didn't have to wait in line very long at all. The views are excellent, although it's difficult to take photos as the coloured lights on the outside of the carriages left reflections on the glass. I did manage to get a couple of good pictures though.",,,
,,Go for river cruise instead.,3,,"Well go if you must, but the flyer doesn't show you anything special more than what you may have already seen driving around the city. Night time run is better in my view, since a lit up singapore is a treat to watch. We went for the river cruise starting at the Clarke Quay later and that gave us a much better view of the old, not-so-old and the newest parts of the city. BTW has some of the dirtiest toilets for a world class city that SG claims to be.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Well worth the experience. Great views over the harbour area and the city. We went at dusk and saw the changing face of Singapore. Plenty of time to take photos.,,,
,,Good view of places around,4,,It was worth the visit. it took abt 45 minutes for a full cycle. Walkable distance from gardens by the bay..,,,
,,Wow!,5,,"Wow! What an experience! The flyer is really well organised with very short queues and even a small exhibition at the start. S$33 (Adult fare) is a fair price, the views are incredible and you get a 360 degree view of the whole of Singapore. I recommend going during the day so you can see out to sea. This is really worth doing if you want to see Singapore in half an hour.",,,
,,Great views but those in the cabin with you can be a problem,4,,"great views, but the large family with us were inconsiderate, loud and let their children run all around the cabin the entire trip on the flyer. It is a reasonably short ride, with a forgettable display before you get into the cabin Go on a week day in the morning to skip the lines.",,,
,,nice but not worth a detour if you a short on time,3,,Did this to give it a try You get nice views but its nothing amazing for the money spent might as well get a beer at altitude bar,,,
,,very nice,5,,"Its was a very good experience, you can see the whole of singapore from the top, and once again in the night its awesome",,,
,,Top of the Singapore,5,,Singapore flyer helps us to have a 360 degree view of whole Singapore. We visited Flyer at the morning time and I think at night its more lightish.,,,
,,Great way of seeing the views,5,,Was a bit scared at top as I don't really like heights but just sat and enjoyed the sights of Singapore. Best time to go is at sunset when its nearly dark.,,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,"We mapped it as one of the first attraction for our visit to Singapore & it turned out to be a good one. you get some great shots from the all glass capsule with a 360 degree view. although the waiting time is high but its worth a wait , it takes 30-40 min for a full circle and i wasn't tired from taking shots. Entry Fees is $33 Per Person and i Guess its good enough value for money.
Must visit attraction in Singapore.",,,
,,Great way to watch sun set,5,,"We rode the flyer at sunset. We timed our ride (30 minutes total) to see the sun set while at the top of the wheel. It was a beautiful sight. The timing also allowed us the opportunity to see the city lights come on after sunset.

The cabins are airconditioned and they are large enough to walk around in; allowing for the opportunity to look in any direction at any time. The cabins were not very full ( only 4 others were in the cabin with us).

The flyer provides great views of the harbor and the city.

The cost is 33 dollars, but it is one of the attractions included in the 2 day Singapore pass (a 225 dollar value of hippo bus and attractions) for 79 dollars.

I would recommend the Flyer, especially at sunset.",,,
,,Better than the London Eye,4,,"As we only had a 2-day layover in Singapore we had to do as much and see as much as we could ina short time. \so, the flyer it was. This gave a really good view over a lot of Singapore. It was possible to see a lot of the Grand Prix circuit that is being prepared ready fopr 2014 - You can even walk on part of the track near the start-finish straight. Excellent views, very short queues, and a reasonable price.",,,
,,Family tour,5,,"Great experience. We were in the top of the flyer just at the time of evening during sunset. So we were able to see both the views, daylight and night. It was great experience, we can see whole singapore from one spot. Must see attraction if visiting to singapore.",,,
,,Nice but avoid the haze!,3,,"Overall, my daughter loved the ride but because it was a bit long and was hard to see much due to bad weather. Make sure you check the weather and avoid the haze!",,,
,,"Great views, must see",5,,Prepare yourself for some of the best views of Singapore on the Flyer. Bring your camera and you're guaranteed to get some spectacular shots. We rode the Flyer on a Saturday in the early afternoon. No wait time. Weather was perfect and clear. Total trip around took about 35 min (who's counting?). Capsules hold total of approximately 20 people but ours had maybe 12. You can sit on benches or stand to take in the views. Overall a great family experience.,,,
,,Fortune!!,5,,"They say if you get a ride there, you can bring fortune for you life. I don't have to much expectation, but I gave a chance and I have good memories from there. Great experience!",,,
,,See whole of Singapore from one place...,5,,Try to make it before 10 am. It's less crowded and you can have the whole cabin for yourself. You get a birds eye view of the important places. It's supposed to be higher than the London Eye.,,,
,,Not a must see but check it out if you've got time.,3,,"There's really nothing too special about this and I didn't expect there to be.

The cabins are air conditioned and comfortable, and you do get a decent view once you're at the top. But ultimately, you're just paying for an overpriced view.

Check it out if you've got time but don't put it on your must see list.

You can take some nice photos at the bottom of the flyer due to the nice views of Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay across the water which I enjoyed more than actually going up on the Flyer.",,,
,,Good value at $33,4,,Enjoyed the views and getting orientated to where things are in Singapore. A lot cheaper than other tourist attracions in other cities,,,
,,must see,5,,"a very goods experience and a must see thing , slow moving giant wheel with air conditioned capsules moving without any jerks",,,
,,lovely view,5,,me and my friend enjoyed the 45 minutes ride. it was awesome and lovely! what i love about this attraction is that it gets you to see singapore 360 degrees!,,,
,,Awesome,5,,This was an awesome experience. It was nice and slow and a good opportunity to see the Singapore view over a 30 minute period. Highly recommended. There are food outlets there too and is good to go late afternoon just before Sunset so you can watch the city change from day to evening.,,,
,,Stunning Views,5,,"Definitely a must for all visitors as it gives you a beautiful view of the city centre, across Marina Bay Sands, The Merlion, Science Museum and Garden by the Bay.

Best time is just before sunset as you get to enjoy the end of daylight views and then the stunning night lights.",,,
,,A great view of the city lighting up at dusk,5,,"There is a great view from the Flyer: we chose to go just after 7pm as the sun was going down, and the city lights were lovely. As July is not such a popular time for tourists, there were only about 10 people on our car (which can hold 28) so it was easy to move around and take photos. It's not cheap, but is worth the money (and there are discounts at some of the nearby bars and restaurants with the Flyer ticket.)",,,
,,Memory for forever,5,,"If you want to remember something at the pictures and as well as in your soul,you must take a ride at singapore flyer at the evening.Get the cube only with your dearest one and you can have the romantic diner there.",,,
,,Great views,4,,Great views of Singapore and surrounding areas. Not exactly budget priced but it was worth the effort.,,,
,,nice experience,4,,something to experience in singapore. nice view of singapore and neighboring islands. though the fear of height almost got the better of me,,,
,,Smooth as silk,4,,"To view from afar you would have no idea how clever this structure is. Cabins are air-conditioned and the view is truly incredible. The ride itself is so smooth you can barely feel the wheel turning and for those that are maybe a little nervous around heights this is a bonus as the gradual position changes mean that you are concentrating on the view not on the movement of the structure :) Don't bother with the photos though, as with many tourist venues around Singapore it's just a ""blue screen"" and they drop you into different scenes. Not worth the money in my opinion, Would rather have something more authentic.",,,
,,Awesome view,4,,Do this at sunset for the best views of the city and skyline. At sunset you get the best of both and then the lights come on!,,,
,,Give it a skip!,1,,"A spectacular and biggest ferry wheel, that's abt it. Small museum leading to the ride is much more informative and interesting then the ride in the wheel.

Once up in the wheel is like a boring and endless wait to get out. Not worth the trip. Good variety of fnb outlets at the location though.",,,
,,Great Experience,4,,"Take a ride to see the panoramic view of Singapore. The ride takes 30 minutes to complete one round and you can capture beautiful pics of the Singapore City. The two domes at Gardens by the Bay presents a marvellous view from the flyer. From its highest elevation you can view the top of Hotel Marina Sands. A must for Singapore visitors, if you have not done something like London Eye.",,,
,,Gorgeous views,4,,"I had been in the London eye before going in the Singapore Flyer, and thought it would be same same, but obviously in a different country and city. It wasn't. There was something more about this ride that made it different. I went after dark, and the city looks gorgeous at night, all let up. I reccommend any new visitor to Singapore to go for a ride in the Flyer. Best time would be just before sunset I would say, as you would see Singapore during the day, then sunset, then at night.",,,
,,Great Views,4,,"Great views of Singapore and the new gardens by the bay. First time travellers a must, try and get your own cabin.",,,
,,It's a great experience!,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is Singapore's version of the London Eye. It's a bit faster than the London Eye. The view is amazing. Take a ride on it, at least once when you're in Singapore. And, if you're into super cars, there's an Ultimate Drive office right below the Singapore Flyer. Get behind the wheel of a Ferrari or Lamborghini and take it for a spin.",,,
,,Amazing views and better than expected,5,,It is difficult to convey or truly get a grasp on how huge the flyer is (and how cabins are). I highly recommend this as it is a blast. The views are amazing and it is a great way to start your visit to Singapore and discover a birds eye view of what you want to see while in town!!,,,
,,gorgeous view of Singapore,5,,"Beautiful view of the city centre from a high vantage point - can see the Garden at the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, The Merlion, Science Museum, and the bustling streets of the city landscape. Best to time your visit to try and catch the flight just before dusk/dusk so you get the blue hues and night views at around 7pm.",,,
,,Great views from above; but worth trying?,4,,"I went there at night and was able to enjoy the sparkling Singapore down below. Interesting and beautiful. But at the same time, our vision is limited at night, so there were fewer things visible.

If you're a first-time tourist, I would recommend that you get a discount ticket and give it a try. The price is actually not friendly for me. I would hesitate to try it at the original price.

There is a food court, so you can consider dining here.",,,
,,Loved it!,5,,"We took a flight with the last tour of the day and we were alone in the cabin. Great, so we could say wooow and ""look there!"" and ""cool"" every time we've turned our heads in other angle. From flyer you have a view on Gardens by the Bay, on Marina Bay Sands hotel, on the island, on the skyline..and that at 165m above the ground.",,,
,,Great way to see the city,5,,If you're in to photography do not miss the Singapore Flyer! It's a great opportunity to see the scale of Singapore and to take some great photos. I highly recommend.,,,
,,Great views for first time visitor,4,,"For someone that is a first time traveler to Singapore, this was a great opportunity to get a bird's eye view of the waterfront and city. The service was fine.",,,
,,great,4,,We had a great time on the wheel. We were lucky that there wasn't to many people around so we got on pretty quick and only had 6 in our car so plenty of room to get pictures without unwanted heads in the shot. Great view from the top. We got our tickets from a tour organiser so saved a couple of dollars on the price.,,,
,,Nothing to crow about,3,,You've been in one you've been in all of them. Nothing special about it. What you see is what you get. Just like being in a giant ferries wheel. Children will have a blast.,,,
,,Exceeds expectations!,5,,This turned out to be better than a super ferris wheel. Great views and a nice experience! Highly recommended. Go early and beat the crowds and line up! Ya Kun kaya toast and coffee before or after the ride is always good!,,,
,,Nice distraction,4,,"Well organised, fun and with great views, but overpriced, as is its London equivalent. No queues when we went shortly before sunset.",,,
,,Like flying,4,,It's like u flying on the sky. U can see Singapore with mini size from up there. The most excited experience forever...!!!,,,
,,Great views,5,,"Great views of Singapore from the Singapore Flyer. It went round very slowly, hardly felt like we were moving.",,,
,,Fantastic Views,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is the tallest of it's kind in the world, and it was impressive. We only had a couple of days in Singapore and were unable to visit everything we wanted to, but we were able to see some amazing sights and architecture from the Flyer.",,,
,,Uh Oh,4,,Not known for my head for heights this was still a brilliant way to become somewhat orientated to the city. Best way to see the size of the harbour and the volume of shipping.,,,
,,Awesome,4,,We enjoyed the ride and thought it was worth what we paid for it - the ride takes about 45 minutes to go around so we did get slightly bored by the end of it. Probably just something that you would do once! Very well organised and safe activity though. It does give you an amazing view of the city and we went up at night so the city lights were shining!,,,
,,"Can recommend a twilight flight, just stunning",5,,"Great views and lights, can get a bit foggy on some windows. If you go about dusk you might also catch the gardens by the bay light display",,,
,,Singapore from the Sky,4,,First Flyer we have been on and it was worth the trip. Went mid day and mid week which worked out great no queing. The sights were fantastic and allowed plenty of photo shots,,,
,,Good views,5,,Fantastic views over Singapore from the top of the Singapore Flyer. One revolution takes about 30 minutes. On a good clear day you can see Malaysia and Indonesia.,,,
,,Worth a look,4,,Good experience. Very High which gave great views over the city. Felt very safe as carriages seemed very modern and well maintained and they moved very slowly which give everyone plenty of time to take photos.,,,
,,Good overview of the city,3,,"This was a good once-off activity. I enjoyed being able to look over the whole city and kind of get my bearings. It was great to check out the lights/architecture of the city, which was certainly impressive. I got a little bored towards the end of the ride, I must admit! But overall a good thing to do... but once is enough! Been there, done that!",,,
,,GREAT,5,,"Excellent ride, great view, very safe, very well organised and managed,it takes about 45 mins to go around once. Good seats inside the capsule. Can book online. There is a place in the complex where one can fly a wide bodied jet in a simulator, expensive but worth it.",,,
,,Private flight!,5,,"Somehow i cant not believe it, i bought a reguler ticket but yes i got this flight solo!! Wow my lucky day! It was a perfect flight, but after 10 minutes okay i got scary get stuck by my self. But who cares? Thanks it was a pleasure to flight with you!!

Cheers",,,
,,The only way to see the city!,5,,The flyer is a must to go on if you really want to see the city and surrounding areas! A great photo opportunity and well worth visiting! Strongly recommended!,,,
,,A fantstic overview of the city and harbour,4,,"A trip on the Flyer gives a great view and understanding of the size of Singapore and the sheer number of highrise building extending out to the horizon, plus how close and busy the port is, an almost uncountable number of ships waiting out to sea. A great way to see and photograph the Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands etc as the Flyer travels at a gentle speed giving you heaps of time to view the city.",,,
,,A must do in Singapore!,5,,What an incredible ride! The views were spectacular. Very efficient service. A great way to get an overview of the city's main landmarks. Good value.,,,
,,Worth it!,5,,Wonderful views over the city. Well worth it! You get a different perspective of the skyline and an appreciation of the more artistic structures nearby.,,,
,,A wheel to remember,4,,Every big city nowadays seems to have its own tourist wheel and Singapore is no exception. The operator claims it is the biggest in the world - it certainly felt high up at the top of its gentle rotation. There were some great views in all directions and it was fascinating to see dozens of big ships out at sea gradually approaching the port area. The pods themselves are spacious and air conditioned with plenty of good vantage points for photography.,,,
,,Fun!,5,,"Good Experience. Moves very slowly, very stable, not at all scary. Incredible views. Well worth the price. Don't miss.",,,
,,Great view,5,,This is a great family experience and excellent way to view Singapore. Go just before dusk so you can watch the city lights turn on and enjoy the experience in the day and at night.,,,
,,beautiful view,5,,"we went on this with fellow traveller friends, really enjoyed the earphones given so that we could listen to comintery of the views we saw whilst doing the rotation. The pic was a great reminder of the experience",,,
,,"beautiful view, but overall it was 'OK'",3,,"we went on at night to see the city from up above. Its a great concept and the Singapore Flyer is an icon so I am glad I experienced it, but it wasn't anything amazing for me. I'd prefer the thrill of a faster moving Ferris Wheel! I will say though that if we had done the dinner we may have enjoyed it more, since it moves so slow you could eat and casually enjoy the view.",,,
,,See Singapore from the sky,5,,"Great view of Singapore. A slow 30 minute ferris wheel ride where each capsule can fit 20 people easily, or just however many is in your group.",,,
,,More Than Just a Really Big Ferris Wheel,4,,"So you want to see Singapore at night but want a scenic view? Check out the Singapore Flyer.

Yes, it is ""just"" an overgrown ferris wheel albeit air conditioned. But I love lights at night. It's a fireworks show without the sparks and goes on all night. If you catch a ride right as it is turning dark the transformation is wonderous. Bring your camera - or phone.

If you are short of time - as I usually am - this is definitely one way to see Singapore.",,,
,,marja63,5,,There were really breathtaking views to see. The ride was long enough to see the city. You can get good pictures of the city.,,,
,,Good view of the marina and outer city,3,,"Ideal location to view over the Marina, Formula1 circuit, Marina Bay Island and also behind the main tourist attractions. Average price in relation to the rest of the city",,,
,,Great views of the City,5,,"The views are amazing, well worth taking a camera, pre buy or buy your tickets at the entrance to the complex, take a trishaw if you are game from the city.",,,
,,Fantastic view,5,,This was a great view of Singapore take a camera . We went in the day. It was great to see all the harbour and ships coming in and anchored out . There were hundreds of ships out in the harbour . Also the view of many high rise buildings . Yes it would be great to see just as nite falls with all the pretty lights . You can get there easy by hop on hop off bus,,,
,,Must experience,4,,Singapore flyer has 28 capsule and each cap carry 28 people and 30 min ride Can watch whole of singapore Should watch in day time and have a meal on flyer in night with 100 SGD with 3rides,,,
,,Must try,4,,"Had an 30 Min drive on singapore flyer. pretty good, if you have singapore airlines boarding pass carry you get 20% discount.

1. try in evening time or after 7pm as you could see city colourfull.
2. on friday or week end watch for laser light show.
3. watch laser show from marilion end it is good.",,,
,,Flyer was must visit,4,,Singapore Flyer was must Visit and a ride that takes you at 500 feet although it run on very low speed but was good experience.,,,
,,Perfect at sunset,5,,"A fantastic way to spend an evening with the family. Dinner at the hawkers, ride the flyer then ice cream on the foreshore afterwards!",,,
,,Great cocktail flight,5,,"We booked our flight as part of a package deal which saw us have a hop on/off bus tour, bubble boat tour, gardens by the bay and cocktail flight on the flyer. We had our own capsule, cocktail drink and even a waiting area before we went on. In my view it's worth the money!",,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"We were fortunate to have a beautiful clear day for our ride on the world's biggest Ferris wheel. Although not as iconic, the Singapore Flyer compares favourably with the London Eye.

We also lucked out with the Singapore Airforce rehearsing for their national day and got a close-up view of spectacular flypasts from jet fighters and helicopters.

The cabins are air conditioned and offer wonderful 360 degree views of the city and the waterfront. Travel time is slow enough to allow you to take everything in and get plenty of great photos but short enough that the kids won't get too bored!

A worthwhile attraction for visitors of all ages and highly recommended.",,,
,,A great ride,5,,We did this just after sunset and it was spectacular. The city is so well lit up that our photos are clear and great quality! Next time I'm in Singapore we are going to do the dinner on the flyer. We also saw a wedding party having their photos done,,,
,,Above average but below expectations visit to Singapore Flyer,3,,"The whole concept seemed good. The wait time was nominal, probably because we had gone on a weekday evening. The air conditioning in the carriage was good. The view was good too, but the height was not too much. Also the movement speed was extremely slow. Overall enjoyable experience.",,,
,,Superb.,4,,Just superb observation wheel. Even my 5 year old daughter enjoyed it. My mother is a senior citizen who enjoyed it too.,,,
,,First time @ Singapore Flyer,3,,"Nice view of Singapore Flyer during the night before sunset. Quite bored if you don't bring games or friends who can chat with.

Best to bring your girlfriend or boyfriend along. Too peace and quiet. Although is view is nice noting that much. Overall feel average. I just bring friends along.",,,
,,Good views of the City,4,,"A nice way to while away 30 minutes and get a birds eye view of the city. If you've been on similar rides before, this is not much different. If you have flown Singapore Airlines take your boarding pass for a 20% discount - well worth doing that. Only downside was a screaming small child for most of the way round and an older one who jumped and kicked anything he could reach. Not sure you can avoid this though!",,,
,,Good views but not overall very exciting,3,,My 19 yr old daughter was really keen to do this as she loved having the views in the backdrop of her selfies. Great way to take in the city um I don't know if this is normal but we did not see the sun once during our stay in Singapore and it was actually raining that day. Glad I did it but probably will never do it again,,,
,,Good view during night,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is a nice to have is your list of things to do.

It moves very slowly giving you ample time to shoot photos though at night it could be tricky because if reflections. Got a good view of Singapore at night.

You can also book for a dining experience in the Flyer.

The Flyer building also has a street food joint, Indian restaurant ""Bayview Tandoor"",
And the start point of Duck Tours.",,,
,,Nice view from top!!,5,,"Worth it, even for people who have been to eyes/flyers in other cities.
Looks nice on singapore skyline. Its safe and stays closed if weather is bad due to rains. We went at dusk and could see Singapore getting ready for night life. Can see golf course, major aspects of Singapore, ship docks, distant islands. Equally enjoyable for kids and grown ups.",,,
,,Great view of singapore,4,,"I was unsure whether to go on the Flyer as I am scared of heights but I really enjoyed the ride. The wheel moves so slowly you hardly notice it and the view is amazing, you get to see all of Singapore. We were lucky enough to only have 2 other couples in the car with us so it was a comfortable ride. We went during the day but I would have loved a night ride. A little pricey but if your in Singapore you should do it.",,,
,,The best view in the city,5,,"I was in Singapore on business and had a weekend to burn. I decided to hit the flyer. I took the MRT into the city and bought my ticket. I didn't realize the line to the flyer went through a kind of exhibit about it and other large observation wheels. It was a nice extra. I had thought I would get a nice sunset view and then night time shots of the city skyline. Unfortunately the trip through the exhibit, which you must do on the way to the observation loading station, took too long and I missed the sunset. The night time views were excellent! Well worth the 30 bucks. While down there be sure to visit the Merlion too. 30 minutes went by quickly. Would love to go again the next time I am in town.",,,
,,A different giant wheel,4,,"Flyer offers a good 360 degree view of singapore city. A nice point to take pictures is once you are on the very top, with no iron railings to interrupt . The cabin was huge enough for us and 1 more family of 3 people. Not crowded during morning hours, so can very well get a silent capsule to hitch in. Pricey.. yes. the capsule rotates slowly that you don't feel any jitters. its an interesting giant wheel....",,,
,,good to see from afar ;),3,,"its a wonderful sight, if you see from afar. Yes its a good way to see around but it moves quite slow, I believe, a person who has the experience of staying at a 41st floor like us, wouldn't be too impressed. but I would say, the pictures come out good from inside. not bad but one could easily give it a miss.",,,
,,Amazing,4,,One of the best view in my entire life! Singapore is a modern city and all architect will enjoy appreciate the view of Singapore Fly! I was at night and the light was such amazing!,,,
,,The HUGE ride with a comfort,5,,"I really liked the way they do not stop and keep moving the FLYER all the time. It looks too huge. With a lot of good things around, Food courts restaurants , shops etc. I really liked the height and you can see the whole Singapore from the Flyer.",,,
,,A good way to get your bearings,4,,"Not cheap but a good way to see the city. Try not to get a car with noisy , badly behaved children .. We did and it nearly destroyed our experience..... And yes.... We do have our own, well behaved child who knows to be considerate of other people",,,
,,VERY INTERESTING,5,,"If you are in Singapore one shouldn't miss the opportunity of riding on this magnificent landmark. The experience is worth trying the organization and admin of the sight is A+. The one hour ride is full of excitement specially at sunset time, the scenery from top is second to none, a panoramic view of Singapore at sunset. Don't miss the gift shop in the way out though a little pricy but good souvenirs to take back home to the beloved ones",,,
,,Great!,5,,"Certainly one of the things that should not be missed in Singapore! Beautiful view of the whole of Singapore, is definitely a place for creating memories for life!",,,
,,What a View!,5,,"Well worth the trip, as long as you are not afraid of heights! The views over the marina and the Singapore skyline are superb.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Great ride offering a wonderful view of Singapore. The shopping centre & the hawker centre next to it aren't quite as nice as the other ones in Singapore. The Flyer itself is pretty cool though. When we went there there was a rowdy bunch of guys behind us in the queue and it seemed like we had to bear their presence all the way within the confines of the gondola, but luckily for us the ticket inspectors/guards let us in with another older couple. Huge props for having the foresight to let the rowdy guys go by themselves.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"Was a great way to see the city, did it during the day but reckon it would even better just going onto dusk as the sun sets and the city lights come on! Not overly expensive, takes about 40 minutes and very comfortable in air-conditioned closed pods with seating. A must-do for visitors to the city!",,,
,,Overpriced and little to offer,3,,Just catch the train to sentosa its just a overpriced high ride and the veiw from hotel was just as good,,,
,,Top Class,5,,"If you stay in Singapore make sure you're there long enough to experience The Singapore Flyer. It is absolutely fantastic, the whole site, not just the wheel, is well worth a full days visit.
The view from the top of the wheel is brilliant with hundreds of photo choices. The organisation is superb and the whole area a credit to the people of Singapore.",,,
,,Experience of a life time.,5,,Experience you must not miss if you visit Singapore. Its an joy ride which you will remember for years to come.,,,
,,Excellent attraction,5,,"This is a must do if you are visiting Singapore. It is not overly expensive, gives you the most fantastic view of the surrounding area, and is very well organised, so very little queuing.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,This is a 'Must Do' for a night time activity. You will see the fabulous Singapore skyline in its full glory. Amazing!!,,,
,,Do it at night!,5,,"This was a great end to another great day in Singapore. The sights of all the lights at night was amazing , the wheel moved at just the right speed worthwhile visit.",,,
,,Great way to see Singapore,4,,We took a trip on the flyer on a recent trip to Singapore and have a very good photograph as a memento. The authorities claim that this is the largest flyer in the world. Whether that is true or not I cannot say but it is high and exhilarating. The views all over Singapore and the surrounds are great especially on a clear day (obviously don't go when it is pouring - usually around lunchtime !). It isn't cheap but worth the visit. Before you go to Singapore you can purchase a book of all attractions - about $175 when I last checked. Could be worth it - check it out. Trip takes about 30 minutes.,,,
,,Stunning views of Singapore,4,,"Stunning views of Singapore, revolving slowly whilst climbing higher and higher into the sky. Not for the faint hearted or those afflicted by hight-fright however as you're surrounded by glass, well worth a visit.",,,
,,Excellent!,5,,"Great to get a good view of the city! Very clean, helpful staff. Lovely experience. The slight downside is that there are about twelve people per pod which makes taking photographs a bit of a battle. Other than that minor moan the whole experience was great.",,,
,,What a view!,5,,We went on the Flyer & were blown away by the amazing view of city & its surrounds. Next time we are over there we are going to experience it at night. Highly recommended.,,,
,,Definately worth doing,5,,"A must in Singapore. The best way to view the City IMO . Loved it. Liked that we could get the Hop,on Hop,off bus and get off there so easy access. The views are amazing .",,,
,,"Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow....",5,,"After a massive day at Gardens By the Bay, we took the Singapore River Boat from Bay Front South at Marina Bay Sands to The Promenade - http://www.rivercruise.com.sg/map.pdf
From there, it is a short 5 min walk to the Singapore Flyer and what a welcomed relief it was to take some weight off our feet and take in the spectacular views of Singapore. We went late afternoon and there was only a couple of people in front of us so we didn't have to wait long and we got our very own gondola! The gondolas are air-conditioned and we felt very safe as you can't even feel the flyer moving. In hindsight, I would have liked to go at twilight to see the sunset and lights of the city but we were tired and wanted to beat the evening rush. Everyone should do this. It was amazing!",,,
,,Great view ofSingapore - especially in the evening,4,,Nice attraction with friends (plenty of room in each gondola) or with that special someone! There may be others similar but worthwhile if you add-in a nice stroll around the area.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Spectacular views across Singapore! Took some great photos. Next time we'd like to do this at night. We followed this with a Singapore sling at Raffles Hotel.,,,
,,Fantastic view over the city,5,,I loved the trip on the flyer. We had a very clear day and the staff were fantastic and very helpful.My husband decided to come on the ride at the last minute .(He hates heights) But he had no problems and loved it even taking photos .There was no movement/rocking in the cabin and it has a large bench seat if you want to sit down.It is very slow so in its rotation so you get to have a great look around the area.,,,
,,Good value,4,,Well worth a visit. Great views from here and lots to do in this newly developed Marina Bay area. Set aside a few hours and try walking around the whole precinct.,,,
,,flying view of singapore,4,,take bus or taxi directly to flyer and don't book tour for flyer as guides waste the time . ticket available at the site . viewing Singapore through flyer is of worth and city looks beautiful . speed of flyer is slow so no dizziness or vertigo feels. through flyer you enjoy panoramic view of Singapore city.,,,
,,View Fareast From with Comfort,5,,"Singapore Flyer is a giant wheel moving at very slow speed. You can join the breakfast session and have it while watching the whole of fareast while enjoying the great Breakfast.
We liked it so much that every alternate year that we visit Singapore we do make it a point to have ride in the flyer. A must visit for all visitors to Singapore.",,,
,,Nice day for pictures,3,,This was nothing exactly special. But the sky was clear and gave us a chance to take some beautiful pictures of the city.,,,
,,View of Singapore,4,,Singapore Flyer stand in the heart of Singapore. It is 30m higher than the London Eye. Each capsule can carry 28 passengers. You can see the Formula 1 hangers on the way up to the top. At the top of the flyer you can see great view of Singapore. At the night when all the lights of the buildings in the city are on. The view is magnificient. You can get a lot of great pictures from the flyer.,,,
,,flying high,5,,The Singapore flyer is fantastic. I am not keen on heights so I feel great when I challenge myself. The cabins are air- conditioned and offer unimpeded 360 degree views with full length glass walls. Next time I will try a dinner at night!,,,
,,Fantastic View of Singapore,5,,the Singapore flyer gives you a great view and idea of the layout of Singapore and you can get a good idea of just how busy the port is with all the ships anchored up in the bay. Would recommend it for all first time visitors to Singapore,,,
,,Fly in the sky,5,,"Oh! really it was an amazing & memorable experience. We were totally 6 members in the shell 0f plyer. We felt as if we are flying in the aeroplane slowly. we enjoyed like anything like heartful laughing with joy, eating snacks, talking many things screaming with joy , taking photography from top view,etc. We are able to see the whole Singapore. My words are not sufficient to explain the joy which we had. It would be more enjoyment if followedby familyand children. If one's life is to be happy he should visit Singapore.My thanks for those who are connected for my enjoyment of Tour.",,,
,,Good Singapore sightseeing from above,4,,"In half an hour you can see great views of Singapore from one of the biggest flying wheels in the world. Nice and slowly go around with ever changing views of the Marina Bay, CBD ,Harbor and surroundings",,,
,,Smooth ride with fantastic views.,5,,"It is a lot of fun! I've riden the flyer a handful of times, at different times of the day and it is always amaizing. You have chance to see the whole CBD area and make very interesting photos.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"Fun experience, very well organised. If the sky is clear then you get a fantastic view. Plenty of space inside the capsule to walk around and take pics from all angles.",,,
,,View Singapore from here.....,5,,There are 48 buses (cubicles ) attached to the ring and is a technological marvel. Bird view from different angles of Singapore is worth the spend.....,,,
,,UP! UP!,4,,The giant flyer is an enjoyable one by covering the land from top. the capsule in which we are rotating is designed in such a way you can sit and move covering 360 degrees.,,,
,,Well worth the visit.,5,,"Even though it was a wet day, the views were fantastic, very well run attraction, and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit.",,,
,,big wheel,4,,a different view of Singapore for sure. it was a nice quiet time to enjoy the view and have a break from the hectic pace in Singapore. cool airconditioning and a bench to sit on as the world goes round makes for a nice ride.,,,
,,Dont miss,5,,"I loved this activity and although I dont like rides much this one was perfect. No fear of heights, you can sit in the middle and see the view or stand right by the edge and look down. Night or day or both is worth every penny",,,
,,"""Awesome views""",5,,"Great experience, no queue, reasonably priced, ride went for 30 minutes and so smooth you don't realize your even moving, took amazing photo's of the Singapore's skyline. Must do the local food walk-about after..",,,
,,well worth doing,4,,Gives you a great view of Singapore.cannot comment of value for money as it was part of a package with Singapore Airlines,,,
,,Excellent Views,5,,"Well worth the Ride. I hate heights and ferris wheels, but this wasn't scary. Very roomy for moving around and photo ops. .",,,
,,Not impressed,3,,This is the second time I have been on the flyer and again it has not impressed me. Why does it not impress - basically there is nothing to see. At least this time it wasn't raining and we could see a bit further but in comparison to other big wheels I have been on - it is boring. For the cost I would rather put my money towards a meal at somewhere like the Equinox or Sands and get the same views while having a meal.,,,
,,Great views of the city!,5,,"Another fantastic attraction done right by Singapore. The enclosed capsule is air conditioned and dry, so regardless of the heat and possible drizzles, you have a wonderful experience. When it's not busy, they are very accommodating and let your party have one all to yourself.

I bought an annual pass knowing that I would take all my visitors here. Worth the splurge",,,
,,Great panoramic view of Singapore,4,,We went up around 5:30 p.m. To catch both daylight and sunset while on the ride. The view was simply beautiful. It was not cheap but a must do especially if you have never been on Singapore Flyer before.,,,
,,Very high in the Sky of beautiful Singapore !,4,,"I enjoyed so much the beautiful ride ... although I spent most of the time laying on the couch in the middle of the cabine, getting up from time to time to enjoy the amazing view and to take pictures ! I'm sooo afraid of height !!!!! When we descended, I became more comfortable and could stay up in the cabin most of the rest of the ride ! You can enjoy the view around and see Singapore from above ! How wonderful ! It would be nice to do it at night !",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Fantastic views of the city from waaaaay up there! One of the tallest ferris wheel's I have ever seen.,,,
,,No kids please were photographers!,5,,"If you are going up to take photo's, don't get in with kids, probably best during the day, as lots of reflections during the night from the windows.",,,
,,Stunning views,5,,We loved the singapore flyer experience. The views from up top were great. We chose to go during sunset and Singapore looked so pretty bathed in that light.,,,
,,One Glance.....,4,,If you wish to experience and feel the heights a round in the Singapore flyer is not to be missed. Besides you could see all the Singapore and even beyond Singapore at a glance from this Giant Wheel. Unmatched fun and experience indeed.,,,
,,Not worth it,2,,"Don't get me wrong, the views are great but for $33 SGD per person, I don't think it's worth it. Just view it from afar",,,
,,We Flew,5,,"We did this on an evening sweep it was absolutely gorgeous seeing Singapore and surrounds from so far up in the air, would have like to have done this on sunset but didn't make it in time but totally worth the trip. Buying your ticket from a tourist counter and not from the flyer itself saved us a bit of money especially when you bundle it with another tourist attraction as you can do with most of the attractions in Singapore.",,,
,,Took so many pictures,4,,Good thing wasn't scared of heights. Wished it lasted longer though. Its beautiful even at night. Little bit expensive they should have given a small token or something. Not many would have enjoyed. Good experience though.,,,
,,Great experience - especially at night,5,,"This was my second visit to the Flyer, this time with my family in tow, and even though I expected crowds due to the local and Malaysian school holidays, we didn't have to queue at all. There was an interesting historical and cultural display on the way to boarding. The views at night are truly spectacular, and the pods are comfortable and air conditioned. This time, we had the added bonus of seeing a dress rehearsal for the Singapore National Day show down on the waterfront with massive screens and hundreds of performers with illuminated signs doing a synchronised light show on the waterfront stage below us. The only downside was the bright strobing lights attached to the flyer itself - although it looks great from miles around, when you're actually on board, it distracts from the view a bit. For two adults and one child there was a 'discount' deal for S$78, so it's quite pricey, but well worth it.",,,
,,See Singapore from Sky High!,3,,"We were there looking for hair loss transplant shop, hairsynergyasia.com but couldn't find it. In the end, queued up to go for the flyer. the flyer was water-stained, couldn't see very well. Still to be able to see Singapore from Sky high was exhilarating. Great experience, though it can be a little frightening as we went higher and higher! Queue was not as long as the London Eye. In no time we got our tickets
The local food walk-about compensated for it. And great place to stroll.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Enjoyed the 30 minute ride - great views, plenty of time to take photos and chat with other tourists. Recommend doing it.",,,
,,Never tire of the view,5,,We go on the Flyer every time we come to Singapore and never tire of the amazing views. With so much development going on in the city there is always something new to see and for us it was the Gardens by the Bay which was under construction last time. The ride in the car is remarkably smooth and you hardly notice the movement. Try to go early if you can before the tourist buses arrive. Our grandson loved it.,,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,Singapore flyer - awesome experience. Incredible view. Definitely on the to do list when in Singapore.,,,
,,Great view of Singapore,4,,"Very quiet on our trip in April. We were able to go to the ticket desk and immediately go upstairs to board the Flyer. Nice to take advantage of the discount available to seniors. Very small wait before boarding and it was appreciated that they didn't wait to fill up the gondola, only six on board for our rotation. Plenty of opportunities to walk around the gondola to observe the various sites of Singapore. Obviously the Marina is close at hand but a good view of the Gardens by the Bay and the opposing views inwards toward the city. Good value at 24 dollars each.",,,
,,First class,5,,"We booked the moet flight before we arrived and werent disapointed, when we got there we were taken to the lounge which over looks the F1 track and i can only imagine what it would be like during the race, anyway, got into out moet capsule and we had it to ourselves as no one else had booked for that time, all i can say is fantastic and the views were unbelieveble",,,
,,Nice View,4,,"The entire rotation for our day trip was a little over 30 minutes. There were no lines on the day we visited. Lots of hands on interactive optional activities before boarding. Easy, fast boarding and beautiful views. There are many choices for dinner flights, cocktail flights, and package options. Discounts if you fly Singapore Airlines.
I think this may be better at night. The lights in Singapore are beautiful in the evening and there always seems to be lots of activity ! Truly a beautiful place with friendly people!",,,
,,Great view,3,,When coming over the bridge from the airport you can see it. Its massive and gives you a 360 view of the city. The price is reasonable. Would go there again.,,,
,,The Perfect Panoramic View of Singapore,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is the world's largest observation wheel, larger than the London Eye. It takes 45 minutes for the one complete round-trip covered by a single ticket. Parties can reserve a cabin, which could hold as many as 15 or so, for a private dinner. Regardless, the view of Singapore from the comfortable air-conditioned cabin is unparalleled. The experience is comfortable, uncomplicated, and a reasonable value.",,,
,,Visit or Miss something special,5,,One of the best places to visit in singapore...The best time to visit is at the evening around 7pm..It is an experience out of words..The city full of lights...,,,
,,Good view,3,,"I was very excited to go the flyer, but all that excitement turned to boredom of 40 mins. It goes fine for half of the time and then its like when it will end. On the other hand, people have different interests, could atleast visit it once for the experience, may be you could lyk it",,,
,,Must do.,5,,Great views await at the top of the Singapore flyer. Definitely best viewed at night time and it gives a complete view of the bay and Marina Bay Sands casino. Not expensive either!,,,
,,Great View,5,,Great place to to view Singapore. Used to be the largest ferris wheel is the world. its really huge and it take around 30mins to turn 1 round.,,,
,,Rise and Shine,4,,"The fact that you can see the whole Singapore in one attraction makes Flyer worth a visit. I visited in evening so the sunshine made many landmarks glorious! Watching the vast sea from up above is memorable!
However, I personally feel there should be a travel expert or some audio commentary explaining all monuments we see from up above!!",,,
,,Love it!,5,,"Loved the Singapore Flyer! Great view, we've done it in the morning. Next time would do it again but at night.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Its a very slow moving flyer, but the fact that you get a cabin all to yourself to enjoy is wonderful. Nevertheless, I felt it was a tad too expensive.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,We were recently in Singapore and went on the Flyer we enjoyed it very much and the view over the city was spectacular we would recommend it to everyone,,,
,,Start your trip with the Flyer,4,,"It provides amazing city views especially at night. A 30 minute ride,though the price is a bit steep for Indian standards,dont miss it.",,,
,,Memorable experience,4,,"The whole ride last about an hour. It has very nice views of the city and you can see a lot of boats, ocean liners, etc. in the ports. It has a nice view at night.",,,
,,Great views at night,5,,"The views you get of the Singapore Flyer are great, especially at night with all the lights. The fun thing is that it rotates so you get to see different parts of Singapore at different moments. When we were up there we also saw the Gardens by the Bay light show and looked pretty colourful from up there. The view of Marina Bay is great. You can also see the harbour, islands off the coast of Singapore, the reworked stadium, and a large part of the residential areas.

Part of what made it such a memorable experience for us was that we were only with 9 people in one capsule. The maximum they are able to fit in is 28 but I am not sure if they would ever do that. You would get to see a lot less with that many people.

One downside of our capsule was that part of the window was foggy, so we couldn't see well through there. Luckily it was only a small part.

The price is quite steep at 33SGD for 1 adult. The flyer takes 30 minutes to make one full circle. They can occasionally stop the flyer to let disabled/elderly people in or out.",,,
,,singapore Flyer,4,,"A must do, inexpensive with stunning views. Marina Bay resort also has great views of Singapore, including the Gardens on the Bay. Singapore has many great attractions highley recommended for short trips.",,,
,,Great views for a great price!,5,,Great value for some spectacular views over Singapore. An unforgettable experience! 100% recommend :),,,
,,Awesome ride,5,,Worth every penny. At a clear day you can see Malaysia. Great view all over Singapore from the number two ferris wheel in the world.,,,
,,Such a yawn,2,,The view was as expected.. Not going there again. Too expensive and was crowded. Rude staff. Won't recommend that experience to anyone. It's really way more worthy to go to kudeta or new asia bar or 1 altitude for that view.,,,
,,Great quick view of the city,4,,"I did this at around 10pm at night, on one of the last rides for the night. Was a great quick, easy way to overlook the entire city and get some pictures. Only thing was sometimes the flashing LED lights around the pods, on the outside, effected everyone's ability to take pictures due to glass reflections, besides that, was great.",,,
,,Give this Flyer a miss & enjoy spectacular panoramic view @ MBS SkyPark for less $,2,,"The Singapore Flyer is located at 30 Raffles Avenue and is fairly accessible by pubic transport. If you take the train, it is an easy 5-min walk from Promenade MRT Station (via Exit A); alternatively, you can take Bus No. 106, 111 or 133 and alight at the bus-stop opposite Ritz-Carlton Hotel (along Temasek Avenue).

The 2 Ticket Booths are open from 8am to 10pm daily; one is located at Level 1 Foyer and the other is at the Parking Bay for Tour Coaches. Operating Hours for the Singapore Flyer are from 8:30am to 10:30pm but visitors are advised to arrive at least 30-40mins before their intended flight time.

We came on a Saturday afternoon and there wasn't much of a queue at the ticket booth. If you do not wish to stand in line, you may purchase your tickets online and save 10% off the admission price (Adult Fare is SGD33).

Flight Entrance is on Level 2 and you will have to pass through security checks before boarding (similar to airport check-in). After security clearance, you will pass through a transitional area where you can glean some rudimentary information on the Flyer (e.g. its construction, size, rotational speed & mechanisms).

Prior to boarding, an in-house photographer will take some digital photos of you and these will be printed and ready for collection after your flight. We opted not to have our photos taken as we know such commemorative photos at tourist attractions are usually exorbitantly priced.

Each capsule has a maximum capacity of 28 pax but they will seldom put that many passengers into one. The capsule we were in only had 6 passengers but we observed that other capsules were slightly more packed with an average of 12-14 pax.

The capsule is see-through on all sides so you get a 360-degree view of the surroundings: historic landmarks of the Civic District; skyscrapers in the CBD; Marina Barrage; Gardens by the Bay; etc.

You are free to move around the capsule while in flight but the view may seem rather monotonous after 10mins or so... The flight duration is approximately 30mins; the gradual rotation is so slight that you would hardly feel the capsule moving at all.

Overall, it was a pleasant enough but unimpressive experience. If you have limited time in Singapore, you can safely skip this over-hyped attraction without regrets. If you do choose to visit, try to time your flight between 7-7:30pm when you can enjoy the sunset and watch the city lights up as night falls...

For truly spectacular panoramic views of the city-state, give the Singapore Flyer a miss & head over to Marina Bay Sands' SkyPark instead. For an admission price of SGD22, you get to spend unlimited time in a 1.2-hectare tropical oasis sitting atop an iconic landmark which is an architectural marvel in itself.",,,
,,See Singapore from the top!!,4,,Gives an amazing view from the top. you can see almost whole of singapore from the top. it is worth the price and must visit.,,,
,,Great view of the city,5,,Perfect way to see the city and even can see the over to Malaysia a the top. Worth the money to go on the world's largest observation wheel.,,,
,,Overlooking sight,4,,"Wonderful ""top of the world"" view of the city of Singapore. Get a glimpse of dragonboat race/practice along Marina Bay from the top. Singapore Flyer ride doesn't make you vomit. Listening to an audio entertainment as well as enjoying the sights both keep you busy during the whole ride.",,,
,,Beautiful view,4,,The view is beautiful at night. Can see the lightings of garden by the bay on the left and Fullerton bay on the right. Cost is $30 per person.,,,
,,Breath Taking,5,,"At first we we're a little sad that we had to share a compartment with strangers but those capsules are roomy! And once you get up there it's just amazing, we went at night and it was just beautiful. We did the most basic option but you can take trips for dinner or with cocktails, but make sure you book in advance.",,,
,,wonderful view,4,,"I visited Singapore in May 2014. Warm day with a bit of haze.

The flyer is located near Marina Bay mall. When I attended there were very few people there and there was no wait time. I purchased my ticket online for a $5 saving.

The capsule is entered from one end and easily takes 20 people however we had 10 in our capsule. It takes around 50 minutes to do one full rotation. The flyer provides you with an excellent view out to sea, the gardens, Marina Bay shops, the city and beyond.

I'm a bit of a sucker for wheels and viewing plattforms however I thought it was well worth the cost.

Enjoy",,,
,,Great ever changing views,5,,"This is a must do in my eyes. I know people say save your money as you can see the view from other points however..... You are on an iconic feature of the country and the views are ever changing with the ascent and descent.

We were fortunate enough to have our own pod. It was air conditioned and we really enjoyed our half hour up there. Pleased we did it.",,,
,,A Good place to enjoy the whole view of Singapore,4,,"Nice Place! This place is so close to the F1 track - once you have finished the view of Singapore, you can have a walk around the place where the fastest cars will be on song once every year. The cabins are spacious, and will definitely thrill you if you are not scared of heights!. You can see almost every part of Singapore from the top most point of the flyer. It takes around 30 mins for one complete rotation of the wheel, for people who find it slow, think about the diameter it covers for the rotation. You have an information walkway here, which explains you about the history of the flyer, its mechanisms of rotation etc. Plus, there is a souvenir shop, which I found a bit expensive. To reach there, MRT - you can alight at Promenade station and walk across the road.

The Promenade place offers the Boat Tours and the FunVee (Open Bus) tours for tourists.

Overall a good experience.",,,
,,Great views,4,,Booked a stopover with Singapore Airways on the way to Australia and this was included in the list of attractions included for free. Great way to spend some time. Better than the London Eye as it's much higher.,,,
,,Flying high,5,,"The staff were very helpful. As I am a wheelie, I did not have to pay, personally escorted from our taxi to ""jump the queue"" and travelled on the next available ""gondola"". It was a bright sunny day, so we had beautiful views all the way round.",,,
,,Great,5,,"We went on a day with no queue so we were able to get straight on, the flyer is a great way to see the sights of the city from up high - all in air conditioned comfort!",,,
,,Bigger than the London Eye...and it works!,4,,"OK, so I'm biased: Revisited London a couple of years ago and there was one thing I really wanted to do when I was there (the London Eye). In true English fashion it was broken! The Singapore Flyer is not only bigger, but it works... and the sun was shining too!",,,
,,Great views.,5,,We have done similar rides in other cities and this one is just as good. We were lucky to have a lovely clear day and we could see for miles. The views were fantastic. The whole ride is extremely well organised and we did not have to stand around waiting in long queues. Well worth a visit.,,,
,,really enjoyed the view,5,,the view was just amazing I did not expect this visit to be as good but I would highly recommend this as you have a view over the whole of singapore.,,,
,,It was an awesome experience,4,,Truly awesome view from above. Actually can see Singapore through different direction. Specially at night it is the most beautiful.,,,
,,Not a wow !!,3,,We went to singapore flyer with much expectations and ethnu. But overall experience was average. It moves very slowly so just does not give a feel of moving and feel as if we are standing still and viewing singapore. Some very interesting views but its all good for a while and does not meet with the cost we spend.,,,
,,A Must See and DO attraction,5,,"Take LOTS of pictures - best to see at night. Take a protein bar with you. Make sure you are not hungry, thirsty or have to go to the bathroom before you get on the Flyer.",,,
,,Scary,4,,"This was not top of my bucket list but I was cajoled into going on it. It was not as bad as I feared being scared of heights but the ride was great. Spoilt only by a child throwing tantrums, screaming and performing and whose parents ignoredher and the nuisance she was causing for the other passengers in the car.",,,
,,Excellent views of Sinagpore City,5,,"Just superb view during the flight ride of Singapore Flyer, having great and superb views of Singapore.
Only one tip if staying in Singapore for 3 nights try to complete it on the day after you reach as if the weather not proper they cancel the flights",,,
,,Perfect View from Singapore Flyer,4,,"I love the view from the top, strongly recommended to see it at night. Romantic view of the Singapore. Beautiful lighting.",,,
,,Fantastic,5,,Worth every penny. Fantastic views of the city from the flyer. One complete circle takes about 40 mins to complete. Go early to avoid queues particularly on weekends. Not to be missed when in Singapore.,,,
,,Awesome,5,,"My wife and I have now been on the Flyer both at night and during the day. The night trip was the Champagne and Chocolates flight. The flight included the sole use of the cabin to just us and of course the champagne and chocolates - very romantic. The view over the city in all directions was spectacular especially as the were several thunderstorms in the distance. The lights of the city were just as spectacular.

Our next flight was during the day and was just as stunning. We were lucky as it was a very clear day so we could see both the islands south of Singapore and the Malaysian peninsular to the north.

My wife isn't great with heights but she thoroughly enjoyed both flights. The flight itself moves so slowly, quietly and with no vibration or mechanical rumbling there is no sensation of movement. Maybe this explains why my wife had no problems with the height from the ground etc. There are brilliant views of the new Overseas Cruise Terminal, Gardens by the Seas and most of the sights of Singapore.

Thoroughly recommend the Singapore Flyer to anyone visiting Singapore even if only for a short stay.",,,
,,just amazing,5,,"the wheel consists of huge capsules. one round on the wheel is 30 mins. and we went in the evening when there was day light but getting darker. we captured the skies and city in daylight and night time. with gardens by the bay, marina bay sands, the race track below. everything was perfect.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"On a clear day you get a fantastic view of Singapore, I recommend doing the flyer during the day and the marina bay sans of a night.",,,
,,see Singapore from here,5,,This was the second time we went up on this and again it was wonderful. The views from up here are second to non. It could be a little expensive for a family but certainly worth the effort anytime time of the day or night. Night time is beatiful but found it a little restrictive if you are not familiar with the layout of Singapore either-way just do it.,,,
,,Breathtaking,4,,"The Flyer was undoubtedly one of the best experience I had in Singapore. It offered beautiful 360 degree views, and a completely new angle to Singapore. Although slightly expensive, it is totally worth it. Do not miss this!

The only thing I wish I had done more was visit the Flyer at night for a more scenic view.",,,
,,Biggest Ferris wheel,3,,"They said it beat the London Eye and you'll get glimpses of Malaysia and Indonesia at every turn. It's so huge you wouldn't feel it's moving. There's not much queues here; don't know if this' a must-try attraction. But if you're billeted or booked say in Marina Bay Sands, you don't have to ride this Flyer. The MBS offers much more. But if you feel like rolling albeit so slow, then good luck with this wheel.",,,
,,singpur flyer,5,,have to visit if u r in singpur.........london eye imitation....but gorgeous view from top...........45 minutes ride ..and u won't feel you are in a merry go round,,,
,,You can give it a miss,3,,Not as dramatic as the eye of London. Think it is something you can definitely miss if you are time starved. The view that you would get from the wheel can also be seen from the top of Marina Bay Sand or Altitude One which are far nicer options.,,,
,,Breathtaking views,5,,"Definitely must see in Singapore. The views are stunning and breathtaking! We went there in night time, but I wish to visit it at daytime during my next visit. If you have more time you can see an exhibition (due lack of time we skipped this part).",,,
,,great views,5,,to be honest I don't particularly like these attractions but I coped okay and it was worth it for the amazing views that you get. Be brave and do it!,,,
,,Good views at night,5,,"I booked a Singapore Sling package for my partner and I and her son for their combined birthday present. When we arrived for our 8pm ""flight"" we sat downstairs in the lounge area for what seemed like ages.

When we were ushered up the elevator for ""departure"". Walking through the VIP line, we were surprised to learn that we had a whole capsule to ourselves! No-one else had booked a Singapore Sling flight! We had 2 Singapore Slings and a mocktail Singapore Sling for Sohan (7 years old) and began the half hour journey around the Flyer.

At night is when Singapore looks it's best... I did read that you can see Indonesia from the top, but the city lights make for an impressive spectacle.

I've been on the London Eye, but the Singapore Flyer has a better, brighter skyline at night... very much worth the extra money for the ""private"" flight!

It's definitely on the ""to-do"" list when you visit Singapore!",,,
,,Have to do at least once,5,,Fabulous views of the city and bay. Best to go on a fine day or even a clear night. I think it was value for money considering the capital required to construct along with the running costs. If there is a group of you it is probably worth booking the VIP capsule,,,
,,worth the effort,4,,"worth the effort of getting there did it about 10am on a Thursday and it wasn't crowded and almost walked on without a wait. Tickets we got a discount using our Singapore Airline boarding passes.
good views and as a group of 7 we had the cabin to ourselves. Easy to pick out parts of the city we knew and cheaper than paying to go up Marina Bay Sands. Would have loved to have gone back at night but the day time suited out 10 to 60 year old group.",,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"This experience was like no other I've had while traveling, and we travel a lot. You can see the entire island from the top and the views are breathtaking. Lots of food choices and souvenirs .",,,
,,Stunning Views,4,,I have been on the Flyer twice now and would recommend doing it at night. The views are stunning and there are fewer people around. It is a very relaxing way to see the bay and with the night lights it adds another level of experience.,,,
,,Pointless,2,,Plenty other places I'm sing to get up high at no where near the cost or deviation from centre of town. You are better off getting a drink on top of 1-altitude or MBS,,,
,,A great way to see the city,5,,"We went in the daytime but I wished we'd gone back at night too. The capsule was large and there was only 10 inside, so we all had plenty of room.",,,
,,amazing view,5,,"again, if you have any fear of heights, but I survived and it was a gorgeous view from the top,(can't fix the date and I have an issue with my account and lost reviews, but we visited in April 2012, not July 2013)",,,
,,Magnificent View,4,,"With this ride and with limited time in Singapore, you get to see everything! The skyline is awesome! You get a 360 degrees view of the whole Singapore.

The place offers a lot. Dining, tours, activities and some shops below.

We only paid SG99, as we were given a family package promo for two adults and two kids.",,,
,,SINGAPORES BIG WHEEL RIDE,3,,"Its fine.. good views.. every city has them now, but worth a visit. The city hop on hop off bus stops there and changes crews so most people visit whilst that happens!",,,
,,What a way to see this part of Singapore,5,,The Singapore Flyer is an experience not to be missed in Singapore bayside. The capsules are large and offer you the opportunity to move around so as to view and photograph this beautiful part of Singapore. The views of the shipping and the huge Marina Bay Sands complex are fabulous. The shops at the base of the flyer are interesting and food is found if required.,,,
,,Good at the end,4,,"We went on the flyer on our final day in Singapore. I think that made it better as you had some concept of everything you were looking at having visited so many of the places. We also had a reasonably clear day so you could see the massive number of ships off the coast.

It obviously gets really busy but we went at about 9:30am and just walked straight in, no wait at all.",,,
,,Dinner with a view,4,,some travellers say that this is over priced but I say not. food was better than expected and of course on a clear night like we had it was just perfect.no feeling of motion. drinks were overpriced though. smuggle in a water bottle,,,
,,Amazing!!,5,,"I went for a short trip with my family in Singapore, we liked it a lot and tihis, Singapore Flyer is one of the mos amazing things that we have went to. Amazing view!! Only thing is that the price is little bit expensive, but it is Singapore. Great place to make amazing photos!",,,
,,Great views of the mighty city,5,,Great views of the waterfront as well as the entire city. It also gives you a birds eye view of the GP circit. A bit on the pricey side.,,,
,,Great aerial views of Singapore!,5,,"Having sampled the London Eye, I pretty much knew what to expect from the Singapore Flyer! Even so, some of the sights of the whole Marina area....Singapore River, Marina Barrage, the F1 Track, the new Sports Complex.....all made it compelling viewing! The kids accompanying us went berserk viewing the Singapore Lion!! Would recommend a visit late evening as the sun is about to set & the lights come on.",,,
,,Good views of Singapore,5,,Had an enjoyable trip in a pod with one other fmaily of 5 so we weren;t crowded at all and plenty of room to move around. Not a good idea if you are frightened of heights as although it goes very slowly then my husband was petrified and only went on it because we had our 15 month old grand daughter so he put on a brave face and went on it!,,,
,,Boring,2,,"I thought it would be a romantic experience, but it was half an hour of zzzzzz! It was a snooze fest! Even though I am not afraid of heights, I couldnt wait to get down. The skylne of Sngapore can be seen from sooooo many other buildings since most of them in the area are high rise, so if you're in to explore a romantic experience, this is not one.",,,
,,Nice Singapore view from the sky,4,,It was a great experience to try Singapore Flyer. We can see a nice view of Singapore city from a many different angles. Hopefully the weather is nice so we can enjoy the view in clearly sky.,,,
,,must visit,5,,we visited the flyer in the day time. it was an awesome experience. i guess one must keep it on top priority in the Singapore itenary.,,,
,,Boring and Expensive,3,,"We had a day reserved for Marina Bay attractions. We started from Clarke Quay and following the river walk we went to Merlion first and then passing by the Esplanade Theatre we walked to the Singapore Flyer. First thing we noticed is that it is not well connected like other attractions in Singapore. Next, after buying the tickets we first hit the history of flyer. Somehow, it feels uninteresting may be because it is dark inside. After that we enter the ""Capsule"", which is very slowly rotating. Once in the capsule, initially you get good views of the Marina Bay area, especially that of the Gardens-by-the-Bay. But after that it's boring. It was a sunny, clear afternoon and we were told that we could possibly see Malaysia! But we could not see much beyond a certain area.
We felt that a running commentary would help making this attraction a more interesting, engaging and offering a value-for-money proposition.",,,
,,Outstanding experience,5,,"Great views, amazing piece of machinery. Safe and sedate. Great if the weather is fine. Good seating if you want to hold back ffrom the edge of the capsule",,,
,,Brilliant experience,5,,A wonderful experience. You will never gain views like this from any other area in Singapore. The staff were very helpful and informative. Do not miss this experience.,,,
,,Awesome!,5,,I went there in the morning it wad a beautiful day and the views were amazing! So worth the money I would do it again for sure but at night this time,,,
,,"A must visit for instagrapher, at least once at day and once at night",4,,"Good experience. My toddler love it also riding this. We can see a scenic view of Singapore surrounded by tall buildings and all. I was coming at noon but found out it was closing due to rain, so we came back at night and have no regret that the possibilities: night having a better view :)",,,
,,Visit,3,,No commentary but glad we did it. Good photagraphy and a good view of the bay.the london eye is better,,,
,,Great way to view Singapore.,5,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our ride on The Singapore Flyer which is much larger than The London Eye.
You can actually enjoy a meal whilst it rotates by booking this in advance and it takes two revolutions to complete your trip.
The Grand Prix track goes around the base of this and one can see much of the track during your trip .
We saw wonderful views of Singapore.
Not to be missed on your trip to Singapore.",,,
,,I enjoyed my ride on the flyer,4,,Good view of Singapore from the top. The ride takes 30 minutes so it's not fast at all and you don't feel the movement. The cars are air conditioned and have plenty of space to walk around in. I think one time is enough though.,,,
,,absolutely fabulous,5,,"I am afraid of heights, this is one of the many height related attractions I built up the courage to ride, and the views were absolutely out of this world! A must do in Singapore. Love this entire country, nothing but praise, people and sites!",,,
,,A must see - Day or Night!,4,,"I've done lots of these sorts of ""big wheel"" attractions in various parts of the world and this one didn't let me down.

I arrived just in time to jump on the last rotation of the night and was thoroughly impressed by the view over Singapore at night.

I returned the next day to take a look with the sun out and was equally as impressed, though if you can work your schedule around a night time flight I think that's the best option - an amazing view of a great city!",,,
,,my wow for the day,5,,"watched others and then took myself and my 12 year old son for a ""fly"".It was great experience ,much less daunting than it looked as a spectator.A great sensation and very memorable.By the time you get your photos it does add up but still cheaper and safer than a parachute jump",,,
,,Well worth it!,5,,"The trip on the flyer lasts for about half an hour, so you have enough time to take photos and get a fantastic view of Singapore. A thoroughly enjoyable experience.",,,
,,Visit during sunset/night,5,,"The singapore flyer offers great views of the city during the night, of you ride it at a certain time you may be able to see the light show at gardens by the bay with the supertrees :)",,,
,,No Excitement,2,,Since the flyer is toooooooo slow there is no excitement in having a ride..I got bored while the flyer is coming down. The ride is about 30 to 45 mins.,,,
,,Well worth a go!,4,,"It's a little slow but it's a great way to get your bearings and get a feel for Singapore. My hotel was within walking distance which was excellent. The flyer was modern, clean and cool. The pods are spacious and have benches if you don't fancy going near the edge. The views were fantastic, I would definitely recommend having a go on the flyer!",,,
,,Great views,5,,"My second time on the flyer. Last time was 6 years ago and my camera broke at the top so pleased to be able to get some good photos. Apparently it is now turning in a different direction to represent bringing money into Singapore. Cute story. Lots of room in the pod so well able to move around and enjoy the stunning views over the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, F1 track, Gardens by the Bay and all the rest.",,,
,,Splendid view but that's all you got,4,,"You absolutely cannot deny the splendid view that it offered from such great height. Looking down at Singapore night scenes from the Flyer was amazing. The glass is transparent, which means it has really good maintenance. This makes the night view even more breath-taking than ever.

But that's about it. For a $33 ride, I think it's not really worth it. The Flyer moves really slowly. Maybe it's really nice for couples or families (there were some really excited kids in my cabin) who wants to spend some romantic and quality time together. But be aware that you are not there alone.",,,
,,Spectacular View,5,,"We chose to go on the flyer in the evening. I would definitely recommend this, it was nice to see the city lit up in lights and obviously to see it from a great height.",,,
,,Must See.....,4,,Go in Evening.....After Sunset....When Lights are ON.....Shows Beauty in Real Sense....Take Photos with Love...,,,
,,Great Views,5,,Recently went to Singapore for the first time and was able to go on the Flyer. If you have ever been to London and onto the London Eye then you have the idea. The views of Singapore from the Flyer are fantastic. You can even have dinner on board. There is a car with tables and chairs. I didn't look into the prices but it sounded intriguing. You can even celebrate your child's birthday on board. A must see if ever you find yourself in this beautiful city.There are all sorts of activities on the ground as well.,,,
,,SIMPLY WOW..,5,,"The flyer is an amazing experience.. You can c d entire city from it. But i loved it at night than morning. Super lit-up city, Garden by d bay & Marina shining in front of d flyer.. Its simply awesome !",,,
,,30 Minutes well spent,4,,The Flyer gave us a nice view of the city (night View). I would suggest you to reach there at dusk so you get a view of the city in the light and then towards the end in the lit up night view.,,,
,,Not worth it,3,,"Offers superb view of Singapore, but nothing you haven't seen from your hotel room window or from the Marina Bay Sands deck. Certainly not worth the time or money. Do this if you have a lot to burn of both.

I came here with four other young adult friends and we all got bored within a few minutes of the ride. Not coming back on my next trip with family.",,,
,,Great,4,,"Great way to see the higher side of the city. It was fantastic, ive never been keen to see the top of the city now I look forward to doing it again on my next trip. Highly recommend doing it - I also like the other options it gives you like doing high tea, or a dinner up there.",,,
,,Exceeded expectations!,5,,"We took the option of having the high tea on the flyer and arrived a bit early expecting a queue. We were invited to wait in a special lounge area and was then personally escorted onto the flyer earlier than our time slot, with no queuing whatsoever.
The tea consisted of sandwiches and some lovely little desserts and tea, coffee and orange juice was served by a very kind and helpful gentleman called Taddie. His customer service was way over and beyond expectations and it was a pleasure to chat to him and learn more about Singapore.
The views from the flyer are amazing and the only draw back was the experience was so enjoyable it was over too quickly. Would happily recommend this activity and will definitely do it again if we are lucky enough to visit Singapore again....
Excellent, professional customer service, stunning views and very good value....",,,
,,Outstanding View of Singapore,5,,The Singapore Flyer is a must to appreciate this modern city. The views are outstanding. The foodcourt has some interesting variety to offer.,,,
,,excellent,5,,Well worth the money you pay - we bought a discounted 'family' ticket (2A 1C) for $72SGD and we were lucky enough to have a fantastically clear day. Daughter (9yrs) was able to take pics from all angles and it gave us back our bearings as we had visited Singapore in the past. Gave a wonderful perspective of what a fantastic city singapore is,,,
,,"A relaxing, amazing view of the city",5,,"PROs: Don't miss the Singapore Flyer! You have to pay a fee but it was definitely worth it. You have a 360 degree view of the city. In my experience I didn't feel dizzy or afraid - this gargantuan ride seems so sturdy.

CONs: A bit pricey and it's not up to you if you want to be alone in one car only with your family. Attendants also could be a bit friendlier.",,,
,,Enjoyed the fantastic view from the top,5,,"We had done this before but through the day. This time decided to try at night. It was spectacular at night, the views were amazing. Photo opportunities were awesome. We had about 25 in our capsule but it is not crowded at all and everyone could easily take photos. There is seats in there if you are not able to stand for long periods. Highly recommend the night time for a visit. Many packaged are available. We did the flyer, the hop on/off bus and a cruise up the river on a bumboat all up $49.90 PP SGD. Good value. Check out packages online as the one we chose was not available at the flyer counter on arrival but inside another shop around the corner from main ticket booth.",,,
,,Great views!,3,,"Went through the week, so no queues. Views of the city were very good. Easy to get to via the MRT. Quite expensive, as all things are in Singapore.",,,
,,Breathtaking view of southernSingapore,4,,It is either the Singapore flyer or skylark for skyline of Singapore. Take your pick. Unless you have a deep pocket. An experience if you have not been on any of these in any other cities.,,,
,,For your memorable Singapore experience,4,,"This is the world tallest Ferris wheel. If you wanna go there I recommend you to go in the evening or the night time that not too hot and you will see the great view ever,so picturesque and beautiful and of course romantic from bird eye view.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Great views of the city and the harbour, also as you approach you get to see part of the F1 circuit. Although its a little expensive its really worth the money and we highly enjoyed it. Recommend for everyone as its easy access.",,,
,,Flyer,5,,Have been on nearly all the eyes and flyers in the world but this is special. It takes about 15 minutes to go around and the view is special . It has many other attractions around it and we took advantage of them as well. Great food stores and a special treat of fish that are in tanks where you soak your feet and they eat all the dead skin off your feet. The flyer is great and each barrel holds about 20 people in all and with comfort,,,
,,Great Night View from the Singapore Flyer,4,,"Singapore Flyer was one place we kept on postponing to visit. This trip gave us the time to do a ride on the Singapore Flyer. It is supposed to be one of the largest of its kind in the world. We went there around 7:30PM, to see the night view of the city from above. We bought tickets and went to the second floor from where you get into the carriages of the Flyer. Each carriage can take about 20 people. The whole trip doing a full circle takes about 30 to 40 minutes.
When you reach the highest point on the Flyer, you get a 360 degree spectacular view of the Bay area. We had a clear view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The best part was that we were able to see the changing light show from the Flyer. It starts at 8:00PM. Flyer is a good option to enjoy the panoramic view in the night and then have your dinner at the hawker market below. It was a small food market with a limited selection of food items. The carriages move very slowly and the rides are not for thrill seeking young people.",,,
,,Best way to see Singapore Marina Bay,5,,Well it keeps on rotating at a very slow speed but takes you very very high that you are able to see many beautiful attractions of Singapore. My suggestion is to ride it at night and the scenic beauty will mesmerise you to your fullest.,,,
,,"Singapore Food Trail - A must try, best hawker food",4,,"Best option to go there is by Bus or Taxi, since nearest MRT Station is located 10 minutes walk to The Flyer. Take bus from Pan Pacific Marina, most buses usually go pass through the Flyer and they have bus stop nearby the Flyer.

At the Flyer itself not many activities you could do except taking the 30 minutes journey on the wheel. The view were as expected, amazing but you should have known from beginning. The view could have been more spectacular at night. The Food Trail at Ground Floor is a must try, they have one of the best hawker food in Singapore in my opinion, to name a few : The Fishball Noodle, Fried Hokkian Mee, Katong Fried Oyster.",,,
,,One look over Singapore,5,,"If you want to admire shining Singapore with alll its amazing, modern architecture, Singapore Flyer is a very good choice. The ride is slow and view is absolutely splendid. U deffinetly recommend it.",,,
,,NICE,4,,"The flyer is superb but an expensive affair. The flyer provides the very nice view of the Singapore city. If your are a couple , then you can request them to make you sit in the cube seprately. THat is possible.",,,
,,A great way to view the city lights,4,,"I went there at night time so i can see the astonishing view of the city lights... Inside each chamber there were only 20 people so there's still quite a space to move around and take pictures, and in my opinion its not too slow, but already at the right speed. Take note though, if u go there at night time and a little bit rainy, be prepared to be postponed by the staff until the next day because they wont operate if there's lightning in the clouds, so have a back up plan if you are a tourist with a tight schedule.",,,
,,Sunset,5,,"We arrived about half an hour before sunset, getting to see Singapore by day and night. It was awesome by day and night. Well worth the fee. Well run, and organised. We asked NOT to get seated in the same carriage we had shared a bus with a family of un disciplined children, and even tho they were really busy, our wishes were honoured and we had a carriage to ourselves. Well worth the fee. Spectacular.",,,
,,Best view of Singapore,4,,"After lot of deliberation on whether to go for Singapore Flyer, we decided to try it out and let me admit, the experience was awesome and memorable. Earlier we had taken similar ride called LONDON EYE in UK which is similar flyer showing the city. You should try n visit in late evening to enjoy the night view which is amazing..",,,
,,Excellent view,5,,"Booked a dinner tour. Frankly speaking, food was not worth it. But the view, enjoyed over dinner, was a wiper thy experience, especially with your loved one.",,,
,,Fly high,5,,Singapore flyer was an amazing experience. It's a giant ferris wheel. It gives a great view of Singapore city.,,,
,,Top of the world,5,,"To view Singapore from above is a wonderful thing to do. Singapore Flyer is the best option. We could take photos, relax and enjoy the wonderful and beautiful Singapore city. Please try and don't miss it.",,,
,,Nice but seem to be too expensive,3,,"The view is nice at night but in my opinion, not worth the price.

You take the ride a little bit slow, but as a romantic person, you will see it very nice, gentle and warm. You have been walking through Singapore River with romantic feeling aside the river, it's a little bit like it here but... with money.

For me, the feeling is great but still, the price rude it a little bit. Nice place for the last day of Singapore anyway...",,,
,,Birthday Dinner,5,,"It was my partners birthday. I arranged for the dinner on the flyer at dusk. The meal was excellent the view were spectacular. The lights of Singapore looked fantastic as it got dark.
My partner was beautiful and we had a wonderful night.
The service was excellent.",,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,"An experience, and a memorable one. Yes, it costs, but the views are spectacular. Go towards sunset, if you can, as the lights start going on.",,,
,,A scenic view of Singapore,3,,"Great view of Singapore. But, it is quite out of the way and you would need to be a bit adventurous to go there via the MRT as the road leading to the flyer can be quite lonely especially around dusk.

Here's an idea, the best time to be on the flyer would be around 5pm-7pm as you will have an opportunity to have a daytime and twilight time view of the city (where all the lights will turn on).",,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Have to try this, was once the biggest in the world. Great views of the city, so great photo opportunity. As it was out of season there were no queues and only 7 in ours. Takes a while but it's worthwhile.",,,
,,Great views on a clear day,4,,"We really enjoyed this, we got there early and had a carriage to ourselves.
The rainforest was lovely and the interesting exhibit in the lead up to the flyer
The photographer took a great photo of us ($20) to purchase after the rude
A full ride takes around 30mins
Lots of eateries downstairs",,,
,,"Expensive, but amazing views",4,,"This ferris wheel is a delight, but on the pricey side. The views of the bay area area amazing and can't be beat. We really enjoyed the ride and appreciated that it went slow enough to really get to enjoy seeing the bay from the different angles. We went at night and it was especially nice to see the area lit up. We also enjoyed the exhibits inside before getting onto the ride.",,,
,,nice ride too sentosa,5,,nice ride over the area with lots of things too see over docking ships and marine parks and hotels like the hard rock hotel,,,
,,Pleasant,3,,"If you have some extra cash to spare and a little free time, then hop on the gigantic ferris wheel for island's birds eye view. The flyer and its grounds are as pristine as the city itself with some nice food options available . There is a miniature hawker market which is highly recommended to sample some local or regional food including indian and arabic fare. A decent souvenir shop is there too. The Singapore Airline's flight simulator called the Flight Experience is located within the premise,but we saved the experience for next time, when we visit with our kids.You can also try your hands on driving a Ferrari on the roads of Singapore with a fee but only if you hold a valid driving license ( of your own country would do). The Marina and Marina Bay Sands Hotel are walking distance from here.",,,
,,Slow but great views!,5,,"On a clear day, this is simply a wonderful view of Singapore so don't miss it! Like the London Eye...",,,
,,Not as good as the hype,3,,"Its a fairly good attraction.. One-of-its-kind in the world, and that's it! Otherwise its just another flyer in the city that takes you to quite some height to get a good view of Singapore",,,
,,Singapore,4,,"At Easter I went to Singapore with 2 friends for 3 1/2 days - we should have stayed longer!. we stayed at the Conrad, next to Suntec. amazing place to stay. so easy to get around. we did so much.
The Singapore Flyer was something I was never going to do.... but when I bought a 'duck tour' ticket - I bought a flyer ticket too. I was so scared. BUT it was awesome! we had the car to ourselves. I even stood up 3/4 around. my friends weren't scared at all!. they say you can see Malaysia on a good day - ours was cloudy, but we saw a lot.",,,
,,wonderful,5,,It is one of the best attractions i enjoyed. It is no doubt slow but one does not get scared of going up and coming down as we experience here. Moreover surrounding was also awesome . No doubt Singapore Govt. takes lot of care of its tourist and never allow any filth around. Everyone has to follow country's rule and regulations then why we can't our country clean,,,
,,Awesome Experience but too Slow,4,,"The views are to die for. Especially at night. Also, if you fly Singapore Airlines, they have a 25% discount. It is a bit slow but again, thats the way theyve designed it.",,,
,,Awesome view in the dusk,4,,"Go in the evening at around five to six pm to get a nice dusk evening glow of the scenery. Awesome view.
While i went there were some areas still under construction. I believe that going again some time after next year. The view will be even better with the National Stadium built and no more ugly cranes obstructing the lovely view of Singapore skyline.",,,
,,Don't like heights,5,,"My fear of heights was put to rest by going on the Singapore Flyer. Hardly any sense of moving and the view was fantastic. Went just on dusk, so Singapore & the harbour lit up during the 32 min ride. If you are on a Singapore stopover you get a free ticket to ride.",,,
,,Not a Great ride,2,,"After taking the MRT, visitors have to take a 10 minutes walk along the unsheltered road to this Singapore tourist attraction as there is no direct bus/train service to the Singapore Flyer (SF). Ticket holders can visit the SF Museum without any additional charges before they queue up for the ferris wheel ride. The queue was short on the weekday we went there as there is hardly any local / tourist there. The short (less than 30 minutes ride) provide visitors with an unblocked view of the Marina Bay area (Marina Bay Sands, Nicole Highway, etc). The view was neither fantastic nor exciting. If not for the complimentary admission tickets to the SF, we would not have visited this out-of-the-way tourist attraction. Not recommended for paying visitors. No wonder this place is not doing well and is looking for new owners.",,,
,,Good view but expensive,4,,"It takes about 30 mins to go through one round on the ferris wheel. You can capture a panoramic view of downtown and sea view. It will be good to go into one of the less crowded capsule, so that you can take nice pictures easily.

It is priced at around SGD$30, which is rather expensive.

On the ground floor, there are many restaurants and eateries.",,,
,,Many changes in Singapore,4,,"Gives you great views of the island. Being a returning citizen, one can see the many changes in Singapore from the top of the flyer.",,,
,,Must if you visit singapore.,5,,It's must if you plan to visit singapore. Easily accessible by MRT (Pomonade MRT station) . I found night ride was better than day visit . You may check to buy tickets online for some discounts.,,,
,,Amazin views !!,4,,This is a definite stop on ur itirenary. Takes 30 mins for a complete trip and u get to see complete singapore below u. Each cabin houses 15-20 persons n u can opt for various other packages like dining etc. best time is during twilight when u can see both the views during day and then the night skyline as the sun sets.,,,
,,Super views from the Singapore flyer,5,,"Fantastic views over Singapore, easy to get on and off the pod. Staff all very friendly and very well organised.",,,
,,Average !,4,,Singapore flyer is considered as one of the landmark but don't find it appealing at all. I mark it as quite expensive and not worth with long queues. Flyer gives the same view as sky park . Dining is a good option inside the flyer.,,,
,,Giant Wheel,3,,"It's a giant version of an all-time favorite Ferries wheel.
This ride is good for kids and elderly people as the wheel is really slow. It would give you a great view of the harbor in Singapore and the famous landmarks. It was an okay ---considered expensive for me for such a basic giant wheel ride.",,,
,,Boring..,3,,"It was a boring experience. Even though you get a bird's eye view of the CBD area, it's not the same as being on the London Eye. Maybe you can just experience it once, just to know how it feels.",,,
,,Good service,5,,"On my birthday, my boyfriend gave me a surprise and brought for a dinner date at Singapore flyer Capsule. The package was a bit pricey but It was really beautiful and I enjoyed my experience there. The food was tasty and the waiters are customer oriented. One disadvantage is that we only had about 1hr to finish the fine dining and I feel that the package could extend for another round or 30 more minutes.",,,
,,The scenery at the top is awesome!,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is the biggest Ferris wheel in Asia and it's bigger than the London's Eye. The scenery at the top is awesome and you be able to view the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the Garden By The Bay, the Explanade, the City View and also the Sea View. One of the 'must visit' place in Singapore.",,,
,,Good for one time experience...but don't expect too much,2,,Good for one time experience...but don't expect something out of the world. Is a Landmark but better if you click pictures OF it...rather then ON it :),,,
,,Save the flyer!!!,5,,"Apparently it's gone bust but still going, would be SUCH a shame it stopped!!! Our boys (7 and 10) loved it and so did we, great if you're here for a visit or just moved here. Fantastic views and the wheel itself is great. I recommend having a Singapore Sling before (and after?) in the Sportsbar downstairs (o'Learys I think), it much more affordable and a million times better than the one ON the flyer (you can book that). The bar also does nice food and is kid friendly. Anyway, it's well worth going on the flyer!",,,
,,Great Singapore Wheel!,5,,Hassle free checking in & ticketing. The views during the ride is simply breath-taking. The staff are courteous & efficient. There are also plenty of choices for food at the venue.,,,
,,Over priced.,3,,Definitely not worth it. Go to the top floor MBS will give you a better view. The ride is short and the view is so so only.,,,
,,A must an Singapor,5,,This has to be on your list of things to do in Singapore! Beautiful views and photo opportunities. Ideal to fully appreciate what Singapore has to offer.,,,
,,Great views of the Marina vicinity,4,,"This is a must-do in Singapore. You will get to reach height of 42 storeys high, see the various iconic buildings at MBFC, the Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, tall skyscrapers around the vicinity, the huge bug-eyes Esplanade theatres, hotels in Marina, as well as the sea. I would recommend around sunset where you get to see both daylight and then night time. Bring a tripod and a good camera with zoom to get a full set of pictures which you can't get elsewhere within 1 hour!",,,
,,Nothing much,3,,"Although this is the world's largest observation wheel (so far), I feel that there is pretty much nothing to be wow about. Mainly because there are far too much construction going on especially around the Marina bay area. The view might not be the nicest but it will be a good experience to at least try once. I'd suggest to take the flyer around 6.30pm to 7pm so that you can see the sunset If you are lucky.",,,
,,Life time experience,5,,"Fantastic and life time experience. You can see entire Singapore in one round of Singapore flyer. Though the entry tickets are expensive and out of budget but once you are inside the trolley,its amazing.",,,
,,Stunning,5,,I never know that Singapore can really have such attraction. On my first trip up there all I feel is how stunning the view from up there. It has dobe us Singaporeans proud.,,,
,,High in the sky,5,,"Fabulous views of Singapore - helps you to orient yourself in this very modern city. The Flyer does not operate in rain, so aim for a dry break!",,,
,,Nice way to see Singapore,5,,This one of the best way to see Singapore as they you can have a list of place you should visit. It gives you a panoramic view of Singapore and on clear day Malaysia and Indonesia,,,
,,Great views,5,,"Easy to get on/off. Gives you great views over Singapore bay and harbour. Plenty of room in each pod to walk around and get that 'perfect shot'. great views of Marina Bay Sands, the floating sports field and the harbour. Also views over the northern part of Singapore.",,,
,,Worth doing,5,,"Went on this late afternoon/ early evening so light enough to see everything but by the time it was over was just starting to get dark so could see the lights in the Gardens on the bay starting to light up.
If buying a Singapore airlines stopover package this is one of the inclusive rides so if you factor in this, the zoo, river safari and dozens of others included pretty much makes your hotel free.
Well worth doing.",,,
,,"Must do , when u r in Singapore",5,,Its a must do thing.. Also bcos it cant be done at too many places.. Only other place I know is London and 2 more... what time to do it ?? day light or night lighting ? I could not decide it so did it in the day light.. But in night also it must be equally exciting.. Fully air conditioned .. takes around 44-45 mins.. U don't realize when you reach the top as you will be busy with your camera or just admiring the city...,,,
,,Singapore flyer,3,,Good view of the sea and city from a great height. However it did not live up to my expectations compared to the view from the London eye.,,,
,,Worth to visit ONCE,3,,"It is the largest ferris wheel in the world. Price is quite expensive comparing to what we experience while enjoying it. Basically you just stand inside an air-conditioned tube that can accomodate around 10-20 person at once for about 30mins. The surrounding view is absoulutely amazing though, especially at night or sunset hours. It is worth to visit once :)
Anyway, the food trail (food court that is located right underneath them) is good. A lot of good food you can try such as chicken rice, satay beehoon, seafood, oyster omellette, etc.",,,
,,not compared to london eye,2,,Well it is nothing quality wise if i compare to london eye. There is no commentary in the tube of what you are looking at. There is just a flyer inside which you have to study before finding any attraction in Singapore. I was scared inside the flyer looking at the quality of material used.,,,
,,Must do in Singapore,5,,"Best done at night where you'll see an amazing cityscape, although taking pictures of yourselves might be a bit of a challenge. Don't miss exploring the museum prior to boarding the Flyer! The interactive displays are really fun and fascinating, especially the table in the middle of the exhibit on which they project the beginnings of the Singapore flyer.",,,
,,Nice view,4,,If you want to see the city from above you should try Singapore Flyer. It is airconditioned and can hold many people inside. We just had to wait in line to get in. Due to unavoidable weather changes it was cancelled for few hours and was resumed again. The admin made sure the people are safe before riding the flyer.,,,
,,Best to go on a sunny day,4,,Unfortunately we did not go when the sky was clear hence the experience was not so good. The flyer moved slow so you can actually have a good 360 view. It started to drizzle hence the visibility was bad. Good to visit once.,,,
,,WOW just awesome!!,5,,"Trust me when you will reach at the top most point of the singapore flyer you will just feel great, the total ride is of 28 min the ticket costs 33$ (SGD) the experience is good the cabins are nice and spacious and is totally air conditioned. To reach their u can take a MRT to BAYFRONT station and from there u can take a cab or just take a walk with the side view of Marina Bay sands hotel.",,,
,,A must do in Singapore,4,,"Although we had been on the Flyer soon after it opened it was interesting to go again, particularly as the Marina Bay Sands and Gardens on the Bay have been developed.
It is a great way of seeing the city but can get crowded particularly when tour buses arrive. Mid afternoon seems a good time.
There is a useful guide available that highlights the areas you are looking at over a 360deg view from the Flyer. Plenty of restaurant options if you want to make an evening of your visit.",,,
,,Nice experience,4,,First timer to visit Singapore shouldn't miss this opportunity to try the famous Singapore flyer. Great experience to be on top and view the famous Singapore landmarks. Total time will be 30 minutes to finish. Inside the attractions offers some restaurants and souvenir shops.,,,
,,The marvelous view of Singapore's heart,3,,"It is a huge giant wheel and is having air conditioned cabins . This place can reached via the boat taxi available from the Merlion park . You can use the MRT up till Raffles place and from there you can walk on the bridges . Also on the way you may come across Asian civilizations museum which is also worth seeing. It would be better if you sit inside it after6:00pm in the evening in order to enjoy the night skyline . You can see various major buildings like The Fullerton Hotel, HSBC bank HQ and also DBS. While you start you will have a photography session(common in all attractions of Singapore). This photo can be purchased after the ride for a sum of SGD$6. Overall an attraction you cannot afford to miss.",,,
,,Fantastic view from the top!,5,,The famed Singapore flyer lives up to its reputation. The view is fantastic and the pace of the turn slow enough to allow photography or just enjoying the view without a hurry. They have options of having a dinner ride where they serve a three course meal as you turn on this giant merry go round :) The simulation gallery at the entrance is great as well. Meant to be enjoyed by young and old this is a must do thing in Singapore!,,,
,,ENJOYABLE SLOW RIDE,4,,"It is a good experience to sit with family in an aircondition cabin and rotate slowly, leisurely in this giant wheel of Singapore. It gives a photographic view of Singapore skyline. One must have this journey at least once while in Singapore. It is huge manmade structure of steel that astonishes everybody. It is definitely enjoyable.",,,
,,Enjoyed every minute of the 40 minute ride..,5,,Fantastic views of the city.. Good for getting pictures.. Although some people may find it slow but we definitely enjoyed.. Recommended..,,,
,,A must go in Singapore !!,5,,"Make sure you visit the flyer in Singapore. Absolutely brilliant view of the Singapore skyline and the Marina bay area from the flyer. Try to visit in the evening, that is when the lights and the skyline give you a spectacle to experience.",,,
,,Wonderful panoramic views,5,,Thoroughly enjoyed the wonderful panoramic views. Dont usually like heights but this felt fine. Could stand up and walk around easily. Not cheap but then hat attractions are.,,,
,,Must do at evening,5,,Catch the singapore waterfront & financial district against it all lit up in the evening. Must do in Singapore. Need to walk about 10 mins ( follow roadside direction ) from Promenade MRT station. Few good restaurants on the ground.,,,
,,Giant ferris wheel with great panoramic views!!,5,,"The Singapore Flyer, like other Flyers around the world, is a huge slow ferris wheel with great views. It is well positioned which affords it amazing views over the city, bay, Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, Domes, Supertrees, and the F1 track.

This Flyer used to be the biggest one in the world until the Las Vegas one opened a month prior. We make a point of riding Flyers whenever we visit a city that has one. Whilst the London flyer has unparalleled views (very few tall skyscrapers in London so similar vistas are hard to find, and so the expense of the ride is easier to justify), the Singapore Flyer has the Marina Bay Sands hotel next door with its own higher & stunning views. We paid for a 2-day Singapore + flyer pass with Duck & Hippo tours which included entry to the Singapore Flyer in addition to other tourist attractions, tours & transport - for the total value of the pass, the visit to the Flyer was definitely worthwhile. If you have to buy your tickets outright and you are travelling as a family or in a group, you might be a bit disappointed as it is not an inexpensive exercise. We were actually advised by our driver on arrival in Singapore not to bother with the Flyer as we were already staying at the Marina Bay Sands which has ""the best views in all of Singapore"", but what the Singapore Flyer gives you that the MBS cannot, is the panoramic view of the MBS hotel itself!! This hotel is an amazing demonstration of architecture & engineering, so the Flyer experience is worth it merely to get great views of this Singapore icon!!",,,
,,Another giant observation wheel,4,,"If you've done any of them, you are better of skipping this and taking the 20$ ticket to top of Marina Bay Sands. If not, then you'll enjoy it for once. The flyer looks beautiful in the night - from the ground. The city no doubt looks very good too from top of the flyer. I liked that they did not stuff more people in the capsule and our family of 5 had it all by ourselves.
The catch remains in the uncertainity of weather. If there are even predictions of thunder or rain, they suspend the service till time unknown. We lost a lot of time in that.",,,
,,a bit boring,4,,"it is a giant wheel going round nothing much,since we visited in the evening it was beautiful and the lights around were nice .do go if u have the time ,if not dont worry u havent missed much",,,
,,Big Ferry Wheel,3,,"I heard this is the biggest ferry wheel in Asia, well it looks pretty big to me! Clean environment but too bad surrounding hasn't got much shopping places.",,,
,,Great Way to see SG from top,5,,"The ride lasts for around 30 mins. When you are on the top of the wheel, its lovely to see SG from top. They also have wonderful customized packages. Try visiting in the evening when the sun sets.",,,
,,Must go for it,5,,Its one of the biggest attraction in singapore. It is also the worlds largest observation wheel. The ride moves extremely slow and you can enjoy the view once up in the air. It takes around half an hour for the ride to complete. But its completely worth to spend your money and time here.,,,
,,Pick one view site,3,,"I agree with others, a bit boring after the first half at least. We did this and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in the same day, so in future I would pick one or the other. The flyer is probably better for families. The annoying ""get your photo taken"" part is another tourist gig I could have done without.",,,
,,Nice,4,,It's a nice giant wheel moving at a slow pace and gives you a birds eye view of the entire city and beyond. Beautiful views from the flyer. Worth the money.,,,
,,Not worth the price and time up there,1,,"I've heard mix reviews for the flyer and had to see for myself.

The verdict:
1) The retro looking foodcourt reminiscent of our old Singapore days is good but pricey.
2) It is nice to take a photo of the Singapore Flyer at night with its pretty lights (best spot is across the river)
3) Your money will be better spent elsewhere if you want intend to pay to sit inside the flyer to see the Singapore skyline as there are better places like MBS skywalk or One Altitude",,,
,,Nice view of the city and the bay,5,,"At first it seemed like 30 minutes for one revolution was not a good use of our time, but the views were lovely, and changed as we traveled around. The view from the top was really nice. Our car was not very crowded so we could walk around and see from all sides.",,,
,,More Than a Tourist Attraction - A True Experience,5,,"Much like the London Eye, the Singapore Flyer is a breathtaking birds-eye excursion over the skyline of Singapore. We went midday on a Saturday when the downtown financial district was quiet. Our wait was not long at all, and although each cab or ""pod"" can hold up to 28 people, only ten were in our group. The ride is smooth and easy. All of our passengers were cooperative so plenty of folks helped to take pictures of families and lots of selfies during our half hour ride. A ""must do"" when in Singapore",,,
,,Must doo in Singapore,5,,This is a place you should never miss when you are in Singapore and this is an activity for all age where you can view Singapore from top and enjoy the Singapore skyline .,,,
,,Good!,4,,Singapore is a modern country but expensive. I like most public transport system here is very cheap and very convenient,,,
,,Perfect Ride,4,,Singapore Flyer is a must ride while visiting Singapore. You can also have a perfect view of city's high rise buildings during the ride.,,,
,,A unique experience...,4,,"We went just after sunset. Seeing the city lights from the wheel was terrific.
The entire experience will take you about 45 minutes, if there is not a significant line. A good camera, without the flash on, is a must... especially when taking pictures of family in front of the skyline. I agree that it is a ""must see,"" but it can be expensive for a large family.",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"We had a very good viewing day and the ride was fabulous. Only six people in our pod so plenty of room to move around and take photos. The ride took 30 mins so proceeded at a nice pace. I'm not a big fan of heights but felt totally secure riding this structure as there was very little pod movement. Amazing views, great experience.",,,
,,Slightly boring,3,,"I don't know, but I found it slightly boring. There is no problem, 165m tall, large cabin, you see much of Singapore, and all that, but somehow it was not very memorable. Went in the afternoon. Maybe more amazing in the evening?

Certainly not a must-do in Singapore in my opinion.",,,
,,"Panoramic view of Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia!!! Great attraction!",4,,"The price I paid for this attraction is worth every single cent. I enjoyed it very much! It's very stable and not at all scary but when you get to the top of the wheel, the feeling is so great. I could see Malaysia and Indonesia from above.

I highly recommend this attraction in SG, a must try for everyone. Best seen on night time.",,,
,,Singapore by night,5,,"Its definitely a good experience to view Singapore from such a height. You can see some tourist destinations like gardens by the bay, merlion, Marinabay sands, F1 Track, Some big hotels, Ship yard and so on. The Journey will take around 30 mins, so choose a right time to visit to cover both Evening and Night look.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,I was hesitant to go on the Flyer; and it ended up being one of the highlights of our eight day stay in Singapore. We were in a 'gondolier' or cabin with only 3 other people; so had plenty of room to walk about and check the amazing views of Singapore. The trip lasted 40 minutes. Somehow it felt very peaceful and grand. Quite different from our ride on the Cable Car the next day - definitely good to do both.,,,
,,"mark it on your ""must visit"" list",5,,"it costs about 30 SG$ per person but it's such an amazing experience!
we chose to see the Singapore by night, when the whole city is illuminated - the skyscrapers, the bridges, the boats at the port... you can see it all from 165 meters.

the full circle takes about 30 min.
there is an option to book a dinner, then you get a private cabin & make 2 circles = 1 hour.",,,
,,Awesome City View!,5,,"We bought tickets for a half day city tour and the flyer was included, it was an amazing view of the city and ocean! You can see all the ships anchored and the whole city, defiantly the best part of the half day tour.",,,
,,An Experience,4,,"This was the first time we'd been on an Observation Wheel so it was an experience. Note that it is a requirement to go thru bag and security screening upon entry.

We visited just after lunchtime and we had a cabin to ourselves which was great. It certainly wouldn't be as enjoyable with a large crowd in the cabin. Recorded commentary upon reaching the top of the Wheel. It was a little bit expensive but unable to compare with other wheels re price / views. We did use our Singapore Airlines Boarding Pass Privledges for a small reduction in the entry price.

Ahead of us was a school party, and behind us a tourgroup. There was no waiting time to board the Wheel.

We didn't visit other shops in the Flyer area but did stop for a quick juice on the way out of the building.

We intended visiting twice, once during the day and once as the sun sets but found just the once was ok.",,,
,,Amazing Experience,5,,What views! A peaceful way to view the city and what unobstructed views. A commentary could be useful as my bearings were not too good.,,,
,,good view... amazing place,4,,"The place is very interesting and lots of things is available. children loves sentosa as there is a lot of attraction, but i love this place. underneath the Ferris wheel is a small ""tropical jungle"" completed with a fish pond. there is a lot to do and it is also the stop for city tours like the hippo and duck tour. you can basically get anything in the place. its main attraction is the big wheel where you can enjoy Singapore and some say, you cam see Malaysia and Indonesia from the area. wow. the view is great and the food there is good, well, there is still a lot of places where you can get netter food, but the food is OK. kids will definitely enjoy it as Singapore is such a family friendly country. lots of things to do. The price is a little bit too high. The concept , i say, is good. visit the area, you will not be disappointed.",,,
,,Great View.... Nice place to be up there.... dont miss,5,,The flyer is a must visit place in Singapore... If you go at dusk you'll get splendid view of the city both during daylight and at night when city lights up....simply superb.... We got onto it between 6:45 to 7:00 pm and got both the views... The night time view with all city lights is amazing... Its 165 mtrs high which is really high... nice comfortable cabins and flight is about 30-35 mins. Overall you'll love it...,,,
,,Overpriced and boring attraction,2,,Not really sure what went into the SG government head when they decided to build this multi-million attraction. It was boring 30-45 mins ride and even most of the shops at the flyer attraction were closing down. Wasn't the easiest and most convenient place to go esp for 1st time tourists. Nothing special and definitely not worth it. Heard that it's now for sale and apparently nobody is interested to purchase it. Definitely a topic of mockery online though.,,,
,,Outstanding Views!,4,,"There is nothing like seeing the views of Singapore from the Flyer. The day we went there was no line, however, there were some fascinating displays to keep your mind occupied if you are in a long line for this. We were fascinated by all the ships we could see, and then the city skyline 鈥?it was all breathtaking. However, with our family of five, it was a bit pricey at $33 a ticket, and so if you are looking for a better value for your money, I wouldn't do the flyer. Perhaps that's why there was no one in line?",,,
,,Sunset,5,,"The ride was amazing! It lasts around 30 min, and i've tried to get on 15 minutes before the sunset, so i could catch a glimpse at the city by day, at twilight, and see the city lights by night. And it kinda worked. Its worth getting a ride.",,,
,,A stunning view of the skyline,4,,"One of the newer attractions in Singapore and certainly worth doing if only just for the view. It is located in the Marina Bay area, and the observation wheel itself (the largest in the world) is 165m high which is about the height of a 42 storey building. The ride is one revolution but moves very slowly enabling its guests to take in the views and to take some great photos. One revolution takes about 30 minutes and costs S$33.00 per adult. We bought our tickets online to avoid any queues. The only downside for us is that the area is very ""touristy"".",,,
,,Loved it !,5,,"What else can you say - loved it , the great view makes it a must do attraction . Cabins are big so you can move around and get different perspectives , wheel moves slowly so you get about 40 mins up there.",,,
,,Unique views,5,,Singapore is a unique city and the views from The Flyer are just incredible. We went early on a Friday afternoon and there was no queue.,,,
,,Full butler sky dining!,5,,Visited the Singapore flyer last year a couple of weeks before the F1 race. From up on the wheel you can see most of the pitlane and garage sections of the track. We went on the sky dining service. In advance we chose our food and drinks and then during two full rotations of the wheel we were served a 3 course meal. There was only 1 other couple in the cabin with us so we had lots of opportunity for photos of singapores magnificent skyline (and the food was excellent as well).,,,
,,"So high, but breathing helps!",4,,Great view of all that the new areas of Singapore have to offer. Heaps of unnecessary pre exhibition stuff to walk through though before you get on board but probably good if you have kids.,,,
,,"Amazing technology, amazing views",4,,The Singapore Flyer gives a good overall view of Singapore and moves so slowly that you can see the major attractions. We were able to see the crowds round the Merlion and where our hotel. The view of all the shipping is amazing. There is room to move around the cabins. Our cabin had a couple with two young children with stroller and I had no trouble getting on and off with a walking stick. Everyone wants to take photos and I'd encourage a bit of thoughtfulness to other passengers. An English couple in our cabin positioned themselves to take their shots without consideration to fellow travellers.,,,
,,A great view of a beautiful city,4,,"If you don't have long in Singapore, I would suggest you make this one of your priorities. It is a little pricey. But the views are stunning and after your flight there are numerous bars and restaurants around the base of the wheel to chose from.",,,
,,Incredible View!,4,,This is an attraction you shouldn't miss. We took the ride at around noon but the airconditioning inside was cool so the ride was comfortable. The view was incredible. Remain seated if you easily get quesy. Take lots of photos and video. The ride took about 20-30 min.,,,
,,Tourist attraction - but worth it for the view,4,,"I wasn't going to go on the Singapore Flyer because it is a tourist attraction - but now, I'm glad I did. We chose to ride the Flyer at night so we could have a view of the night lights in the Marina Bay Sands area including the Gardens by the Bay. It is a memorable view of Singapore. The cost is justified when you think of the memory of the view - and that you may not be returning to Singapore any time soon.",,,
,,Must ride :),5,,Singapore flyer gives a very nice view of singapore.. Especially if you climb it at evening when the sun is about to set. Good experience :),,,
,,Breathtaking panoramic view,5,,It was really great experience....I got the chance to see the whole city of Sinagpore.the view from the top was extremely beautiful.,,,
,,"Great view, 30 min fun",5,,"View is phenomenal. You can see entire Singapore: Harbor, Art & Science Museum, Esplanade, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, everything.
If you had a chance to experience London Eye, that one is really bigger and you can feel that.

If you get there during week days let's say till 11.00 am, you have quite big chance to have a gondola for yourself.",,,
,,Sunset sights,4,,Lovely half an hour trip at sunset. Gives a good perspective of the downtown area and great photo opportunities. Worth the $33 for the views. It would be lovely in the evening with all the lights too!,,,
,,"Expensive , but worth it for the view",4,,"Was the last item on the list after a day of exhaustive touring around the city. There wasnt any crowds for getting the tickets and got onto the capsule thingy pretty much immediately . We shared the space with another family so there were about 10 of us , but it was in no way inconveniencing. The ride is slow and lasts about half an hour , from start to zenith and back . Gives plenty of time to admire the view and take photos . We got on the flyer around sunset , so got to see daytime Singapore while going up and the night on the way down ! The view of the Marina and the coastline from the top is absolutely stunning .",,,
,,Good view but SLOW,3,,"Great views, yes. Great photos, yes. Slow? Unbelievably slow. You will be ready for off by the time it goes all the way around.",,,
,,Such amazing flyer,5,,"the sightseeing is amazing, very high flyer together with light and music, we were shocked because too beautiful and amazing.",,,
,,Breath taking experience at an incredible view,5,,"The singapore flyer takes the ferris wheel concept to a whole new level. You are on board a large capsule where you can either dine, drink champagne or just relax and take pictures. The ride is slow and steady. You will be able to see singapore at a different view and this view also differs during daytime and the evening. It is a must go when you're in singapore.",,,
,,Excellent views,5,,"I was expecting the same lines ups that I faced in London, but to my surprise, there were just couple people waiting. The rotation speed is very low which provides a good opportunity for pictures, probably even at night. The capsules are much larger than what London has.

The views are impressive. The F1 race and paddock is just at the bottom of the flyer.",,,
,,Amazing view from the top of the wheel!,4,,"Quite expensive for such half hour on the wheel thingy. The view from the top are amazing, you will usually go together with few other groups and the staffs will make sure it wont become over crowded so you can still take good pic of yourself and family.

Not advisable for those having heart problem or phobias.

For those who wants to have romantic dinner (though it is can be quite pricey), you can have it inside the box with the wheel turning. it can be really romantic at night. A butler will stay inside during the whole dinner to serve and provide you with what you need.",,,
,,A Great Panoramic View of the city,4,,"We enjoyed the flyer wheel, took good photographs and had a good view of Singapore city. The downside was that the ticket cost was too high, like everything else in Singapore. Anyway, it was an enjoyable ride and we, friends had a great time.",,,
,,A must do when you go to Singapore,5,,From the moment you enter the pod you have excellent views of the surrounding areas from the sea right into the heart of Singapore. It takes about 30 minutes to complete the trip. When you look out to the sea it is impossible to count the number of ships waiting to enter the port. I counted 50+ ships,,,
,,Great Views Over The Bay,5,,"When we went on the Flyer (April 2014), I think it was still the World's largest? Dubai (where else?) and Las Vegas have even bigger ones either in the pipeline or in action now! The views are great both by day and by night! The night views of the marina are really spectacular.",,,
,,Feel on the top of the world,5,,"Singapore Flyer should be must on itinerary, when you are in Singapore. Most unique and amazing offering of Singapore Flyer is, One actually can see 5/6 different countries from top of the flyer. An aerial view of F1 track from Flyer is bonus. One of the most beautiful view i have ever experience till date. Looking for another visit to Singapore, to get my second ride on Flyer.",,,
,,Nice flight above Singapore.,4,,Singapore at night is very beautiful and the best way to the see the lights is in the Singapore flyer. The cars are very comfortable but glass a little dirty which meant some of our photos didnt turn out too clear. Expensive but worth the effort.,,,
,,Wow what a spectacular view over Singapore.,5,,Take a tour and see the amazing Singapore city from above in the Flyer. I will recommend that you take an evening tour as the fantastic lights of the city i absolutely wonderful.,,,
,,Great attraction!,5,,"We decided to try the Singapore Flyer by night in order to have view on the bay with its lights and so and we were absolutely happy with our decision. The view are great in particular on the second half of the tour with a complete view on the bay. Additionally I have to say that the organization and management of queues was just very good, so on top our waiting time was almost nothing.",,,
,,Birdseye View,5,,Well run and a relatively cheap way to spend an hour. Offers great views over Singapore - an excellent way to see the city as evening turns to dusk.,,,
,,Best if someone else pays for your ride,3,,"I agree with comments that the Flyer is well-maintained. However, frankly, the panoramic view of the Marina Bay can be enjoyed in many other (in my opinion, better) ways (for examples, high tea and dimsum pairing at the 60th floor of the UOB, SGC 25-35/pax), or cocktails/mocktails at the Lantern Bar, Fullerton Bay Hotel).",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"The Flyer is a must-see attraction in Singapore, and is extremely well organized too.

You get to enjoy the beauty of the entire city at one go - with excellent photo shoot opportunities, as the flyer goes at appropriate speeds allowing you to enjoy the rounds and also to position yourself well and take stunning photographs.

Worth visiting for sure, and they also used to give discounts for booking online or if you have a Singapore Airline boarding pass. Double check their current terms on the website and take a call though.",,,
,,Nice activity to do when in Singapore,4,,"Very similar to the London eye but overlooking the Marina. It's definitely a nice way to see the city.

The views across the city and beyond are lovely and the location above the marina adds to this.

We walked all the way down to the flyer from the Robertson quay and were pleased to find clean and air conditioned pods.

Definitely worth a visit when there.",,,
,,Awsome,5,,We went onto the flyer during the day and the view was spectacular. Its a must do...... we caught the MRT from the hotel and after a couple of changes arrived just down the road from the flyer,,,
,,Highest Ferris wheel in the world.,4,,A must visit Attraction in Singapore. It shows panoramic views of the city and you can see most of singapore from the cabin of flyer. Guests can also chose to wine or dine in it. the whole round takes around 45mins and is nice overall.,,,
,,Great views,4,,We had a capsule all to ourselves. Wonderful views over the city area and out to the bay. It would be nice to have a commentary or a brochure listing the main buildings you can see while on the Flyer.,,,
,,Amazing,5,,"To celebrate a dear friends birthday, 10 of us paid for the Moet & Chandon flight experience. The flight was booked for 7pm which allowed us to see Singapore by night. The whole experience was magical, champagne, chocolates, strawberries and lovely music was played throughout the flight. If you are celebrating a significant event this is the perfect way to start the evening.",,,
,,Singapore flyer Ferris wheel,4,,"As with the London eye Ferris wheel, these are designed to give you a birds eye view of the surroundings, and the Singapore Flyer does not disappoint, not too expensive and the waiting time during our visit was short.
For those with families or those that want great pictures of Singapore to take home with them, then this is a must, do it in the day time and again at night to see the amazing Singapore skyline change.
Many shops and restaurants are located in the base building, one of the best is the Flight Experience Singapore, and flight simulator that let's you get behind the controls of a Boeing passenger jet (fantastic hour).",,,
,,Great way to see the city!,4,,"The views from the flyer are amazing. You can see over so much of the city, and all the boats out on the water which was really pretty.
Very clean and cool pods, which they didn't overcrowd so it wasn't like you were fighting for a space to see the view.
On the way to the flyer you walk through a section that gives you the history and details about it also so is very informative.",,,
,,Great view!!,4,,"Woke up late and didnt have time for a tour so thought we would see it all from 1 place. Clean and comfortable and nice and cool. Great view, definately worth a look if you dont have time to do it on the ground.",,,
,,Good to visit,4,,"It gives you a great view of Marina Bayd and Downtown Singapore, also is located near several other attractions, no reason not to go.",,,
,,Singapore by Night,4,,We waited until evening to ride on the Flyer and that was a good decision. Singapore by night is spectacular and the view from the flyer is breathtaking.,,,
,,Awesome.,5,,Amazing view of the Singapore city from worlds highest flyer. Looks superb at night. View of Marina Bay Sands is awesome when the flyer reaches its highest pint. Totally a must visit..,,,
,,Nice way to get a panoramic view of downtown and Marina Bay,4,,"This was a nice experience. Located in Marina bay. The flyer goes slow enough to really enjoy the views of Marina Bay and Singapore River, Merlion, Fullerton and Esplanade.",,,
,,another big wheel,3,,"good view but not breahtaking, in my view just another big city wheel! My advice is keep your dollar's and eat out in one of the many beautiful restaurants with a better view",,,
,,Amazing View!,5,,A really worthwhile experience! We were very fortunate to have a clear day and get a carriage all to ourselves - 5 of us. I don't know if this had something to do with having a private guide or the fact that it wasn鈥檛 that busy. It was great to have the whole carriage to ourselves. The Flyer is much higher than the London Eye with an interesting walk to get on board instead of waiting in a line up outside. I would highly recommend doing this while in Singapore as it gives one a feeling for the environs of the city.,,,
,,Over rated...,3,,"It's boring... Just good enough for pic taking. The view is not that breath taking. Overall, it's just ok.",,,
,,Magnificent view,5,,"I was there with my fiance. It was a lovely experience. They charge 30 SGD, but totally worth it. we were excited. Do not forget to go there in a evening. we went around 0530 pm. eventually you can see the city lightening up.",,,
,,if you want to go with few people go at night,5,,"We went to the Singapore flyer after our excellent dinner at Jumbo seafood. Too bad for us that there were almost no cabs on Friday evening.... but that is what you can expect on a rainy day.
The view was amazing and we had with the 2 of us a complete cabin for us alone. It is moving slowly, the only bad thing I can say is that it is difficult to make a picture at night because of the reflection Also a good thing to check is that when you come up with the escalator you do not use the first toilet when you come up at the left but take the second on the right where are no 20 people from a bus tour..",,,
,,All aboard the Singapore Flyer!,3,,"The Singapore Flyer is one of the tallest observation wheels in the world and gives fantastic 360degree unobstructed views of downtown Singapore. The Flyer can be seen from anywhere in the downtown core, but the views from inside the Flyer鈥檚 pods can even allow you to see the other side of the country, on a clear day.

The Flyer is conveniently located on Raffles Avenue and can be accessed by the MRT at Promenade Station, from where it is a short 5 minute walk to the ticketing booth. I found the tickets for the Flyer to be a little on the expensive side (S$33 per adult guest), but I guess this is Singapore, after all! It鈥檚 not cheap here! You can ride the Singapore Flyer between 8.30am and 10.30pm. It is probably best to see the cityscape during twilight hours or during sunset.

Security is tight here, much like at various skyscrapers around the world such as Taipei 101 or The Shard in London. I had to walk through a full body scanner and have my camera x-rayed. It is nice to know precautions are being taken. There was an indoor educational display with strobe lighting as you walked from the ground level to where you boarded the pods. I was also pressured into having my photo taken for a souvenir that I insisted I was not going to be purchasing! Anyway, when all was said and done, a group of about 10 of us boarded a pod and began our slow rotation.

There is enough room for everybody to sit down if necessary and there is a video and audio guide to inform you of various titbits as you go round. Interestingly, if you book in advance and pay a special fee, you can actually have dinner with your girlfriend in the pod with a specially arranged table for two. It must be nice to wine and dine at such elevation, and must be especially romantic in the evenings.

I stood for the whole 鈥榝light鈥?and enjoyed my time observing the views over Singapore. It is the only high structure I have ever been up in Singapore so it gave me great views that I will never forget. Unfortunately in my 鈥榝light鈥?there were a group of very loud Chinese tourists who were loudly nattering for the whole time about nothing in particular (believe me, I speak Mandarin). I wondered why they bothered paying the price if they weren鈥檛 going to show any interest.

Anyway, when all is said and done and you get back down to the bottom of the Flyer, there are some restaurants and shops for you to get a bite to eat or buy yourself a souvenir of your experience (but don鈥檛 let the attendant in the queue bully you into having your photo taken!). Regarding the food outlets, Seafood Paradise, in particular, seemed very popular when I was there, and I think there is also a Popeye鈥檚 selling your traditional fastfood items.",,,
,,Go for a Smooth Flight with Views,4,,"Many cities now have their own Flyer but in Singapore the size, the comfort of the cabins and the views are all of the highest level. The location is a bit awkward to get to unless you use a taxi or hop on/off bus but it is so smooth that you almost don't realise it is moving with around 30 minutes per cycle.",,,
,,Worth a Trip,4,,"Yes, it's touristy. Yes, it's a clich茅 thing to do. Yes, it's worth doing. It doesn't cost that much. It give you an amazing view of the city and harbor. The cars are air conditioned. It moves very slowly. I don't think anyone with motion sickness would have a problem with this. The building where you load is nice. There are other attractions there and lots of places to get a drink or some food. They have a lovely waterfall and Koi pond on the lower level. We were pleased with our experience.",,,
,,Amazing views of Singapore.,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a great way to get an overview of Singapore, with especially good views of Gardens by the Bay and Marina area. We only shared our pod with 3 other people so we had a lot of space to check out the views in every direction at every height. We went in the late-morning which was a good time for taking photos. Luckily the glass pods are air conditioned so it is also very cool. It was interesting how the views changed at different heights. We didn't spend a lot of time looking at the lead in displays, but you could study them for quite a while before you even go on the Flyer. Well worth it.",,,
,,Singapore from Above,4,,View Singapore from above in an air conditioned cabin (escaping the Singapore heat). Especially nice view of the harbor and Gardens by the Bay. Not cheap but well worth the money in my opinion.,,,
,,Not bad,3,,"Not bad, good view of the city. Condensation on the outside of the windows which was bad but the view was good. Got a freebie via the Singapore air stopover which is unreal value for money",,,
,,Stunning,5,,"The structure is 165m high but the structure is very solid and you really don't feel that high. Each capsule is totally enclosed with access to 360 degree views.
I went on twice as I loved it so much. The view during the day is great but at night Singapore is stunning.
Photos are harder to take at night due to the reflections on the glass though.
If you only go on once the night ride is best.",,,
,,Go in Evening to have both Day and Night Views,4,,"We particularly took the ride at around 7:00 pm and could enjoy both views of day and night (you'd better observe and check out the sunset time more accurately in Singapore). We enjoy the whole ride, not boring as assumed. No need to wait long for boarding as passengers can board when the wheel is moving.

The plaza under the flyer has quite a number of eateries and shops. Looks fun and good.",,,
,,Awesome View,4,,Went there last year. Stop by after our early dinner at Marina Square and the view from the top was magnificent! Very good and cosy environment at night.,,,
,,"WOW, the amazing views!",5,,"The Singapore flyer is the biggest tourist attraction in Singapore. Tickets for the flyer are available online or at a ticketing booth on-site. The ferry carts are large with air conditioning and are able to fit 10 or more people. The ride takes approximately 30 minutes for one circle around. Once at the top of the ferry at the highest point, the view is amazing. There are plenty of photo opportunities as the ferry turn is slow and steady.

The flyer can be found a short walk away from the Promenade MRT Station.",,,
,,Great view to see,5,,"You can see the whole view of city area, nice to be on the top of the city. The disappointing is they only open until 6pm. I believe the night view will be more fabulous.",,,
,,What goes up must come down,3,,"i was a little disappointed with this particular attraction, especially considering the global hype it has received.
its really positioned in the middle of nowhere on a Singapore scale and has been strategicial centered to be parallel with the business district.
at night the disco effect from the lights can be rather distracting as you try to admire the Singapore skyline.
for me i thought ionsky was a better lookout.",,,
,,Excellent views,5,,"We pre-booked and it was really worth the cost. The views across this fantastic city were amazing. I'm not too good with heights, but you have nothing to fear. We had a daytime trip and so close to the F1 track. A must do when in Singapore.",,,
,,Superb View,5,,Worth every bit of it. The morning trip allowed us to see a lot of Singapore for great heights. A modern day wonder,,,
,,Worth the $,4,,Yes it is a little pricey. Once you get on and you start moving up to the top of the world you forget about the dollars you have given up. The views are spectacular and give you a fantastic perspective of this phenomenal city.,,,
,,Great View & Worth the Price,5,,"Good place to visit for leisure & have lunch after the ride ! Fantastic View ! After lunch, you can walk along the bay, cross the Helix-Bridge to Marina Bay",,,
,,Great views with AC!,4,,"Singapore is hot and sticky, so getting on the Singapore Flyer we were pleasantly surprised to find the large pod air-conditioned. I usually suffer from motion sickness when things spin, not here, though, it moves very very slowly and won't even stop for getting on or off. The views are great from up there and you have a bird's eye view of this futuristic-looking city. And if course the glass is clean....you are in Singapore, the cleanest city ever....so you can easily take photographs through the glass. We paid the senior price of almost US$ 20 each and found it was worth the price for the overview. At night, you can see the Flyer from far away because it is lit up and the colors change all the time. I would recommend visiting this famous landmark. There is a MRT station nearby as well as a boat station by the river for your transportation.",,,
,,Must see in SG,4,,The flyer is Just walking distance from promenade MRT station. worth a visit and you can see entire Singapore .also the food corner under flyer has great local food.,,,
,,Well worth it,4,,"Having been on the London Eye and enjoyed it, we thought the Singapore Flyer would be a good way to see the city and we're glad we took the opportunity. There were no queues - we just turned up, bought tickets and walked straight on. There are some different cabin types - the basic one just has a bench seat but there are some with a bar that offer canapes & drinks while you 'fly'. The views are superb.",,,
,,worth the price,4,,"after a cruise we decided to have 3 days in singapore..we were going to go to the hotel that has a ship (shape) on its roof but . decided it wasnt worth the price so we went on the singapore flyer..Fantastic...large , clean, cool. pod's. and the view's were great. you get to see for mile's..and take some good photo's. well worth the trip",,,
,,Good place for a visit,4,,"Get a good view of the entire Singapore from this Flyer. A cool place and easily accessible from promenade MRT station.
The only catch if it is raining avoid going because i had to go there twice as first time it was stopped due to rain and thunderstom.
Like all other places in Singapore prices are on the higher side.",,,
,,Very good for views,4,,The flyer is a little out of the way but worth doing. It never seemed busy while we were there. You do get a good view and it is air-conditioned so nice to sit in a cool place and watch the surroundings in comfort.,,,
,,City lights...,4,,"Check weather forecast before visiting Singapore Flyer, best not to visit on a gloomy or rainy day. Best time to visit is during the afternoon or almost dust. Singapore city lights, amazing.",,,
,,Great Trip on Singapore Flyer,4,,"We chose to travel on this at night time, it was impressive gave a great view of the city including the Marina Bay Sands where we were staying, we nearly chose the wrong time to go as it was Earth Hour in March where all the lights in the city were turned off but thankfully it only lasted 10 mins of our trip and it was good to see them all come on after this time. Staff at the booking office a bit miserable but the assistants who helped you on and off were polite",,,
,,So slow but fun sight seeing,4,,"The ride was slow, long and boring but their is an amazing view of Singapore. You can never really see it moving in the distance but guess what, IT MOVES! I would still recommend this for people who love the internet because you can get an amazing view of some attractions such as the garden by the bay, marina bay, the science museum and Singapore basically. This allows great photos for the internet wether it's selfies or panoramic photos. ( I just wouldn't recommend this to people that have an extreme phobia of heights)",,,
,,step back if you are scared of heights,4,,"stunning experience seing Singapore through a glass especially for those who like taking pictures, a bit impressive if you are scared of heights, must see at night, no queue at all.",,,
,,Sensational,5,,Loved the delicate 30 minute trip overseeing stunning Singapore. After disembarking we had a delicious meal in the adjacent food court. It is very easy to get to by MRT as the Singapore Flyer is very well sign posted at Promenade Station.,,,
,,Something different to experience,4,,It's very slow moving but gives you an opportunity to snap away with your camera. Great views of the skyline and bayside. No repeats on this.,,,
,,singapore flyer,4,,"A 360掳 view of singapore is what you are expecting, yes! Then this is the place you are looking for! A different experience. Recommended visit once. Cant add up anything else special to this place .",,,
,,"very slow, very long wait",3,,"we decided to go as it was our last day in Singapore and we wanted to do something special. when we got there we had to wait a horrible 2 hours because of the queue. when we finally got on we were squeezed in with a mainland Chinese family who kept talking as if they were 10KM away from each other. they view is not to good as there are many tall buildings blocking a bit of the view. it is also very, very slow so bring a video game and lots of money.",,,
,,Great Ride,5,,"One of the best things i did in Singapore.. great view and reasonably priced, morning on a clear day or sunset times would be the best times to go.",,,
,,Best View of the Harbour and the City,5,,"This is by far the best view you can get in Singapore. Unobstructed 360 deg view. Night time ride is especially wonderful, seeing all the city lights and if you are lucky, follow the line of planes coming in from the south to land at the airport. Just make sure the sky is clear when you decide to go ... duh ....",,,
,,The Wheel and the rest of the Boring Singapore Flyer,1,,This place was a total waste of time. It was very boring and I would never want to go there ever again. It was shocking The place was all cramped and it was bad. My rating out of 10 is 1.,,,
,,Different experience & View of Skyline,4,,This is a different and once-a lifetime experience to travel by this flyer wherein you get to see the bayside and island view at different heights as well as neighboring countries from an eagle's view,,,
,,OK but won't do it more than once,3,,"This is a nice thing to do if you are willing to part with the entry fee. I must admit it's rather expensive. The experience is fun to do once, just to take in the wonderful view. As usual, like most things in Singapore, it's well-executed and super efficient.

But I won't pay for this twice. There are tonnes of skyscrapers with rooftop bars and restaurants from where you can also enjoy the great Singapore view. Many other options there.",,,
,,Good view,5,,"Flyer offers amazing view of entire SIN island. All my friends and family who visit us, loved this. One thing I have noticed, how the crew there, helps elderly folks to get-in and get-out...truly empathetic, which I admire the most. Worth a visit guys!",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"I enjoyed the experience of going up the Singapore Flyer. Within the 30 minutes it took to make a full circle, one can enjoy the view of the city and the seascape, though there were also some 'ugly' structures in place for the civil works on new MRT line. I could not remember how much was the charge but it was not cheap. May be that is the reason for dropping revenue and I heard the Flyer is now under receivership or similar arrangement.",,,
,,take a bird-eye view of the city Singapore,5,,fastest way to have a quick view of the city - take a bird eye-view from the air if you don't have time for city bus tour. Enjoy!,,,
,,Can see changi airport n batam island,3,,Overall is a nice place to go. Fm top can see changi airport n batam island. The cubicle is moving slowly so u can see 100% on the place that you are seeing. Whole round takes 45 mins,,,
,,Catch the view,5,,A great way to see Singapore in a short time. Great if you don't have much time to tour Singapore. Day or night rides and scenes are worth the value,,,
,,No sweat!,5,,"Even if you're frightened of heights go on this attraction. It moves very, very slowly and the views are really amazing...the F1circuit, and Singapore city laid out before you. Distant views of Malaysia. And it's the highest in the world and probably the cheapest!",,,
,,Good view of some islands nearby Singapore and will definitely see MarinaBaysands,5,,"Ride is near to 40 mins. Fully air conditioned. As the capsule goes higher, u will see more majestic views of the singapore's infrastructure and buildings. Ample parking lots. Taxi are available too.",,,
,,Kaleidoscope of Peace and Harmony.,4,,"The march of a united people, all before your very eyes. At a glance, 50 years of Nationhood (almost), Peace, Wealth, Harmony. A small price to pay for such a view of the Little Red Dot.",,,
,,Flying high,4,,I found this the best but unfortunately its not for those that are not very good with heights.My husband doesn't enjoy going so high there for found it a bit over whelming. We went up at sun set it was also during the light show in March so there was plenty to watch. May be going up in day light may have been better for him. As for me it was great to see so much of the city and places of interest a must do while in Singapore.,,,
,,Good value,4,,Great opportunity to get a birds eye view over Singapore. Would like to try the afternoon tea in the pod next time or the cocktail in the pod deal.,,,
,,Nice scenery,5,,Great experience. I was able to see the nice scenery view of Singapore. recommend to go during the night as the night scenery of Singapore is beautiful.,,,
,,Bella vista!,4,,It's a must do indeed. The wheel itself is quote a marvel and the ease of the rotation makes it perfect for taking pictures and day dreaming. Beautiful surround with a food court and tropical atmosphere is the best one of these I've seen. They really take time to showcase this beautiful and slightly pet space style City. It's a bit like Elysium the movie - the view that is! Well worth the entry prove of $33 per adult.,,,
,,"Great Wheel, Great Scenery",5,,"A must visit while traveling to Singapore. From above we can see Singapore completely. The best time to visit is around 7 - 7.30 pm when the sun is set. That's the perfect time to takes some pictures. Unfortunately I got the wrong time when visited. The ticket was kinda expensive, SGD 28",,,
,,30mins beautiful view!,5,,"It's worth the price though if you go once a while because you get to see very beautiful view but for just 30mins, go at night, it's more pretty!",,,
,,Must do,5,,What a great ride and the view was brilliant. The day was very clear and you could see almost all of Singapore. Would have loved to go back and do an evening dinner but ran out of time,,,
,,"If you don't do this, you are missing something",5,,This was one of the best flyers I have ever been to. I went there with my family and it is just the perfect place to spend with your family. You will be able to see the whole of Singapore and enjoy the scenery. There is a spectacular view and you are probably missing something if you don't go here,,,
,,"Good View, Excellent experience",5,,"We got complementary admission as a part of Singapore Stopover Holiday. We liked the ride immensely. The Wheel takes about 40 minutes to complete a turn. There was no queue when we visited at about 5:30 PM. Would be better to take around 6:15 PM as you can enjoy both the day and night views.

You have to get on and off the Flyer in running condition but it is very slow so not a problem.",,,
,,Cast a flying eye over Singapore!,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a real ""must do"" if you have a night or two in Singapore. It's reasonably priced (about AUD$30pp Adult) especially considering it's the biggest in the world and that it overlooks one of the more stunning city skylines you'll see. One of the first choices you'll have to make is when to visit.

We bought our tickets at the counter with no issues but you can pre purchase through the Singapore Flyer website. Just be sure it's the authentic site as there have been some bogus sites in the past trying to sell tickets. They offer some great discounts (conditional) for seniors and students too.

The Marina Bay area is wonderful during the day and you will also see the hundreds of ships parked out to sea but my wife and I agreed that the Singapore skyline at night wins every time. It really is sensational. Other added bonuses worth mentioning are that it's generally quieter and cooler in the evening (the cabins are beautifully air conditioned though) and the lines are shorter ( I love that).

The ride lasts around 30 minutes. I left my camera pack at the hotel, thinking it wouldn't be so brilliant so I'm really lucky I took my little portable Ixus, the shots you'll get will be breathtaking. I used a few different camera modes and lucked out with some real keepers. We only took the standard 30 minute ride (One rotation) which we thought was pretty good value. The Flyer does offer a number of other special options too.

I should say I'm not usually interested in this sort of thing and wouldn't normally add an attraction like this to my travel plans but my wife insisted and I'm so glad she did. I'll be first in line to something like this whenever we visit a new city from now on. Enjoy your ride.",,,
,,Great Ride.,5,,We rode the MRT to Promenade Station and walked to the Singapore Flyer from there. We were lucky that when we arrived there were no long queues so we got straight on. The ride takes thirty mins and what a great ride it is. One of our party is nervous of heights but even she was at ease with the pace of the ride. The carriages allow for great views but the sight that amazed us the most was the amount of cargo ships lined up out in the bay waiting to continue their journey. The Singapore Flyer is well worth a visit.,,,
,,must do...,5,,singapore flyer is a must do activity in Singapore. one ride takes only 45 minutes. we did it on a Sunday but there was not long Q. we enjoyed it very much. My recommendation is to do that during the sunset hours.,,,
,,Awesome experience!,5,,"I feel fee to the attraction is a bit too much, but if you have a Singapore Airlines boarding pass you will get some discount.

Once we were inside the Flyer there were no regrets for the fees too,

It is for 30 minutes and once you start ascending you will get to see the SIngapore skyline.

You can see Marina Bay Sands Skypark, Gardens By the Bay,distant Merlion and Esplanade.

Definitely worth it.",,,
,,Excellent views of the Singapore,4,,"We went early to best the queues, managed to get our own compartment. Thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience and fantastic views of Singapore. Walked back to Clarke's Quay along the river front. Fun morning!",,,
,,Loved it,4,,Lovely experience. I have been on the London Eye during the day and at night and recommended to our party that we did the Singapore flyer after dark. The experience and the city lights were beautiful. I'm sure the day tour is excellent too.,,,
,,Greta start to our visit,4,,"It is so much easier to visit a city once you have seen it from the sky. The flyer and it's mall were a great morning for us. It is safe, quickly, affordable and worth the taxis to get there.
We had about 6 others in our vessel which made it easy to get pictures taken and even some of us. After our turn on the flyer we also enjoyed the 6D movie theatre and the coffee shop.
We wished we could have gone around the loop one more time.",,,
,,Capture the beauty of singapore,4,,"the 30mins ride is a treat...Moves slow enough to capture the beauty & high enough to see a good part of singapore..
I suggest visit flyer at the end after you have seen singapore so as to relate to the places you have visited..
Though a little expensive however you would not want to miss this...!!",,,
,,1/2 hour of amazing views,5,,"An incredible feat of engineering, superb views, 1/2 hour for the full circuit, nice gardens and koi to look at afterwards. . . worth the money . . .",,,
,,Great ambience and great place.,5,,"It's a great place to spend your day with your date, being in the flyer and see the entire view on the flyer! The night view would be perfect!",,,
,,A lovely 30 minutes,4,,"There were no lines (we went on a Monday morning). The ride was well conceived and executed. It was a lovely way to spend 30 minutes. The food court at the Flyer is one of the most traditional in Singapore with great food and great prices. The Flyer is a bit pricey, but worth doing once.",,,
,,Highly Recommed for Night View,5,,Must do in Singapore. Highly recommend for night view. I would be better if you take the ride at around 7:30 to 7:40. You will be able to see the light show of Gardens by the Bay and light show of Art Science Museum when you get to the highest position.,,,
,,Not for people with a fear of heights,5,,We went to get a night time view of the city. It is a bit pricy but worth doing once. The view is amazing from the top of the wheel. I would not recommend this for small kids as they will get bored.,,,
,,What a lovely view,5,,Went on the flyer at about 11 am no queues straight on. The ride takes about 30 mins and the views are great Staff very polite and helpful A must do in Singapore,,,
,,must see,4,,"easy to find, very short line, picturesque views from the observation car, excellent way to see Singapore from an aerial view.",,,
,,One round is not enough,5,,"About 30 minutes in the capsules will not enough for you. Enjoy seeing Singapore from Singapore Flyer. I was there in the day time and I can clearly see whole Singapore, but people said that it would be better if you go there in the night and you can see Singapore City/Country View. They also have package with Dinner, Champagne (Small Party), or Wedding. The capsules can occupy to almost 30 persons. If you go by a group, maybe they will put you in the same capsules.

Overall the attraction was so great and to me... I promise to myself that I will be there again.",,,
,,A Must Have Experience in Singapore,5,,"During our recent holidays at Singapore, we experienced a ride in SIngapore FLyer along with my very old mother who also liked it very much. Though we went during off-peak season but based on readers experience, we had pre booked the ticket to avoid long queues for purchasing onsite tickets. Since we had gone on a working day and in the afternoon, the whole car was for ourselves. The view from a 360 degree ride is just stunning. Really pretty cool and one-of-a-kind experience.",,,
,,Fabulous views of a fabulous city!,5,,"Must admit to being a little nervous about going on the Flyer as I'm not great with heights! However, I am so glad I did it as the views over Singapore and it's impressive skyline were just stunning. We were fortunate to catch it on a quiet day with only 7 of us in the capsule so loads of space to move about and enjoy the views. Definitely well worth the ride!",,,
,,A must !,5,,Great views of Singapore from here .. It was really quiet when we visited so had a car to ourselves.. Nice.. Every visitor should put this on there list of things to do !,,,
,,Great view a night,5,,This ride really let's you see Singaporeans skyline! I recommend it at night so you can see the light show at gardens by the bay! You get a great view of the beautiful marina bay sands. Great experience,,,
,,Bird's Eye View from the Top of the World,5,,"Although my husband and I had been to Singapore many times before, we had never ridden on the Singapore Flyer until this trip. The Flyer is located within 5 to 6 blocks of the MRT Promenade Station, taking about 10 minutes to reach by foot. We had pre-ordered tickets online to avoid a lengthy line, but there was no line when we arrived in the early afternoon hours on a weekday. In fact, there were so few people there that we were able to get a Flyer Pod all to ourselves. The ""flight"" lasted 30 minutes. The revolution is at such a slow pace, you barely notice that you are moving. The structure and pod are so substantial that even someone like myself who is not a fan of heights had no problem enjoying every minute of our flight. The panoramic views from the Flyer are a picture taker's dream. We found this attraction very enjoyable and would recommend it to others.",,,
,,Great opportunity,5,,"We had a car all to ourselves! The view was absolutely amazing, a clear day and we could see for miles. Very cool.",,,
,,Biggest flyer in the world,5,,"Very good view of the city of Singapore. To avoid the queue come early as possible. And the view is better in the evening.
What I dislike is that all attractions of Singapore are very expensive. The Souvenirs too very expensive and refrain us from buying them.",,,
,,A flying view of the city,5,,Only queued for 5 minutes. Limited number of people in each pod. Takes about half an hour. Views are incredible. Good value for money,,,
,,Looking out over Singapore,4,,"I think this is a very good attraction for people of all ages. The pods are quite large and because they travel at quite a steady pace, the ride is very safe and comfortable and that allows you to enjoy the 360 degree views of the whole city. You can look out at the harbour with all of ships at rest, or over the CBD on the other side. The price is not all that high either. I recommend you add this to you schedule if you are going to Singapore.",,,
,,enjoyable ride,4,,"Not scary, because the cubicle was very stable and sturdy, so the journey going up and around the flyer was pleasant (I'm actually afraid of heights)",,,
,,360 degree Viewer,5,,One of the best place to see a 360 degree view of Singapore. It is maintained very well and neat and well organized. Very friendly staff who ensure that your trip in the flyer was a memorable experience. More importantly it was not crowded even during a holiday season.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"This is my second visit to the flyer and I thoroughly en joyed it again. It is a wonderful way to see views of the city area and for those scared of heights, as long as you look out and do not look down, it feels safe. There is no feeling of motion at all - a very smooth and secure ride.",,,
,,A Great View of Singapore!,5,,"As a part of the 2-day HOHO tour package, the Singapore Flyer became a must. Now being a little leery of heights, I approached the experience with a little trepidation. Because the flyer rotates so slowly, there is never any concern. It was a comfortable and very stable ride to the top and back down. We all are so glad we had that opportunity. Don't hesitate!",,,
,,What a view !!!!!!,5,,It was a wonderful view where u can see the whole singapore from top with the hospitality at its best by the ground staff,,,
,,Great view,5,,"This is the London Eye of Singapore. 360 panoramic views of Singapore city, Marina Bay Sands, Bayside Gardens the sea and surrounds. We had a clear afternoon the day we did the ride and you could see for miles out to sea and across the city.",,,
,,Great fun,4,,"The Singapore flyer is excellent value for money, compared to the cost of the London Eye. The views are great, but make sure you pick up a map from inside the pod as it helps to explain what everything is. The build up before you board was very informative and interactive for children. Definitely a must do.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"We went in the morning on a Thursday in March. Even though it was a beautifully clear day it was very quiet and at least 50% of the capsules were empty, and we had one to ourselves. Great views of the city and the myriad of ships in the Singapore Strait.",,,
,,On top of the world,4,,"Built along the lines, but bigger than the London Eye, this big wheel offers superb views over the whole of Singapore. Situated on the harbour side, overlooking the sea and right next to the Formula 1 racetrack, and with easy access from the underground railway system. There are plenty of shops and restaurants in the complex offering water, ice cream and snacks, as well as souvenirs, and offices to other nearby attractions including the Duck Tours, a series of amphibian buses which give sightseeing tours of the harbour and surrounds. At S$30 a throw, we thought it a little on the pricy side, but a must if you are only in Singapore for a couple of days. On a personal note, we didn't find it as impressive as the London Eye with its views of the Thames, Parliament etc., but appreciate this is a matter of personal preference. Well worth a visit.",,,
,,Must visit in Singapore,5,,Good way to see panoramic view of Singapore City. Total round takes approx 30mins therefore if possible be on board just before the sunset so that you can observe sunset along with twilight view.,,,
,,No great shakes,3,,"The Singapore Flyer has been made on the lines of the London Eye, but its colour tones at night are an eyesore. Jutting out over Singapore River alongside the iconic Marina Bay Sands, it offers a great view of the city, but can actually be given a miss. Singapore has much more to offer the discerning tourist.",,,
,,Spectacular view of Singapore,4,,"Other than the Marina Sands, the view from here is the best of the city, also you can opt to have dinner in your cable car if your looking for a sky high dinner. Although you have to arrange it ahead of time.",,,
,,Views amazing,4,,We went to the Flyer thinking we would not see too much as it was hazy. We got on & the sun broke through. The views were amazing. A great way to get a panoramic perspective of the city.,,,
,,A must do,5,,"Wasn't very busy; so we really did enjoy the tour. It def is a must do in Singapore. The views are amazing; as F1 fan it was good to see the landmark in very race.

The background history etc was good to read but the kids just wanted to get into the capsule. I would recommend; would have been great if it highlighted the key landmarks similar to what the London Eye does.

The price is reasonable as you'd expect Singapore isn't cheap",,,
,,Well worth the trip!,5,,"Amazing views. We went first thing in the morning when there were no queues and we picked a clear day.

If you book online you are unable to reschedule your day if the weather is poor!

Beware if you purchase your tickets elsewhere in Singapore they may not be honoured at the entry gate. Several people were caught whilst we were there. Basically it's a scam to sell underpriced tickets to tourists.

You are also able to do champagne flights and high tea, and also evening / sunset dining cars, however if it is the first time you ride the Flyer you're really concentrating on the views and taking photos.",,,
,,Fantastic panoramic view of Singapore,5,,Fantastic panoramic view of Singapore CBD and Marina Bay. Breath-taking spectacle from right up the top! would recommend this 30 minute ride for anyone!,,,
,,A must when in Singapore !,5,,Go early ! The line can be quite long ! I had an awesome view over the Singapore Formula one race track (and it is actually possible to walk on it !!) And also notice the gigantic fleet of ships in the delta !!! Awesome !,,,
,,Fab !,5,,"Great views over the city comfortable and spacious pods reasonably priced , great tourist attraction",,,
,,The only way to see the city.,5,,"This huge wheel is a joy to ride. As it slowly revolves you are treated to ever changing views of the city, the harbour, marina, port, gardens. Thankfully the pods are air conditioned!",,,
,,DAZZLING CITY,5,,"This is a must do. You get on to the flyer and the views are stunning. You can view the entire city and it's perfection. The view encompasses the harbour, the New stadium, gardens by the bay, highways, remarkable buildings, brilliant architecture and so much more.",,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"If some one does n't feel comfortable with heights , ridding the flyer will be his chance to enjoy the breathtaking view , cause it moves very slowly . We took the flyer twice , the first time was at night ,it was amazing , the second time , was afternoon and it was very enjoyable too.When you are in Singapore, don't think a minute of dropping away this attraction , just go and enjoy the fantastic feeling .",,,
,,Moet exclusive car experience. He Proposed!!,5,,"We booked the exclusive tickets with Moet champagne, strawberries and chocolate. Checkout the website for info. The other cars are jam packed with people and we were lucky enough to almost have this car to ourselves with only 3 others on board so we had a great private experience. And to make it even better HE PROPOSED when we got to the top! Arghhh so exciting and Romantic! Go at 9pm on the dot and see the Gardens by the bay light show whilst on your flight. The Singapore skyline at night is absolutely stunning and addictive! We couldn't get enough of rooftop, waterside, night time views of Singapore!",,,
,,"It's not a ride, and It's terrific",5,,"First off, it's not actually a ride. It can be called just an observatory even.

My first impression was something like merry go round, which scares me a bit lol. The Flyer just rotates real slow.

But it is terrific in terms of the views you can get of nearly all of Singapore's wonders. Must have experience for SGP visitors.",,,
,,Eye of the Singapore,5,,What a Pleasure it was. Singapore flyer is the biggest Flyer in the world. one can experience all views of the Singapore at a time while you are on it. It is the best place to take photographs. Night or day it gives different - 2 beautiful views,,,
,,Awesome,5,,Awesome view to the whole city Biggest ferris wheel in the world In the night it looks even more awesome with all the colour changing light A must do!!,,,
,,Better then Marina Bay Sands Roof Top,5,,"We really loved the flyer rather then MBS roof top as you were restricted into a corner and could not even sit at the restaurant

I would recommend you only visit only one of them and though MBS is alot higher its still a very similar attraction to the wheel

lots of food and drinks stalls available, we attended during FORUMA 1 as we had tickets to watch the race and this attraction was right next to the track",,,
,,Holiday of a Lifetime,5,,On our holiday of a lifetime we stayed in Singapore for two nights during december 2013 and we went on the flyer. What an experience. I do not like heights but this was fantastic as the wheel goes very slowly as you do not know you are moving and is an impressive size and the views are well worth it. Don't forget your camera!!!!!,,,
,,Seeing Singapore Most part of Singapore from above,3,,"The 30 min ride in a private capsule was great, the picture taken from above are beautiful but other than that not much attraction. Perhaps will try in the evening next time for private dining.",,,
,,Awesome views,5,,"This is the biggest wheel in the world & only just comes below the height of Marina Bay Sands Skypark.
Believe it was about 拢13pp - pensioner rate.
Very slow & sedate it takes about 45 mins for the trip & once on the top it is absolutely stunning.",,,
,,Very Good,4,,The Singapore flyer is a very good attraction. We were a group of thirteen and all of us had a great time.The views are actually brilliant! It is amazing. You must take your cameras with you. Its a short visit as its for 45-60 minutes.,,,
,,good way to see Singapore from a different angle,4,,"Should be on every tourists list TO DO. and also good for locals (like me) to see Singapore from a different angle. Good for a group session of visitors too, we booked a session with a team and had drinks on the way around.",,,
,,Breathtaking view of Singapore skyline from world's tallest ferris wheel,5,,"Being in Singapore and not visiting Singapore Flyer is certainly not an option. And guess what its world鈥檚 tallest Ferris wheel鈥?a good 30 Mtr taller than the famous London Eye. It鈥檚 a 5 mins walk from the Promenade MRT station. Exit from Gate-A and follow the directions to reach the Flyer. If you are on Marina Bay Sands side take the Helix Bridge to cross the bay and turn right at the end of the bridge.

The place is generally crowded and you may have to wait for about 15 鈥?20 mins to board the flyer. The capsules are huge and feel very solid. Though each capsule can carry upto 28 persons, generally they allow 15 to 20 persons per capsule. So it鈥檚 not cramped inside. The flyer takes about 30 mins to complete a full circle and moves so slowly that you will barely feel the movement. The view from the flyer is simply breath-taking鈥?particularly the Marina Bay side which you will start to see after your capsule reaches the top and starts descending.

There is a small rainforest garden at central atrium of the terminal building. Flight Experience (flight simulator) which is another great attraction is located on the Level-2 of the building. There are plenty of other fun elements for kids like XD Theater etc in the buildings. There are plenty of restaurants in the building also鈥?Seafood Paradise at Level-1, according to me, is the best one. There are lots of street-food type eateries at the backside of the building also.

The ticket costs S$ 33 for adults and S$ 21 for kids. There is also a sky dinning option @ S$ 269 per couple which lets you enjoy a dinner while enjoying the great view鈥?dinner option lets you take two rounds (approx. 1 hr). Best time to visit is after sunset for the mesmerising night view of Singapore skyline.",,,
,,Good view in comfort,4,,"This is a must do if you're visiting Singapore I highly recommend it if you prefer to be in air con comfort in comparison to the Marina Bay sweating and paying mega $ for it!
This is cheap cheerful & a great way to see the skyline if you're on a budget.
I suggest going later at night around 9pm this will give you best opportunity to have a capsule almost to yourself!",,,
,,Good experience if you havent been to Singapore before,4,,"Thankfully the day I went on the Singapore Flyer it wasn't very busy - I can imagine it wouldn't be as enjoyable if you are standing in a long line waiting to get on board.
Bought our ticket and was on board in less than 10 minutes with only a few other people in our pod. Fantastic views of North South East & West of Singapore - on a clear day you can see out to Indonesia.
Worth the visit if you havent been to Singapore before and you want to have a birds eye view of the city",,,
,,Super duper views!,5,,Loved the entire experience. Gives you a bird's eye view of Singapore on en enjoyable 30 minute ride. Definitely recommended.,,,
,,Wou- view,4,,My recommendation to visit this flyer is at evening when light starts to glow. The flyer goes for 30 minutes and request crew to allocate individual capsule as you can enjoy your moment with privacy.,,,
,,Great View,4,,"Great View, but It was death by Phil Collins!!! (Against all odds on permanent loop in the background). Well worth it, recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore",,,
,,Singpore Flyer,3,,This is a bigger version of the London Eye but with stunning views over Singapore. When busy the wait could be quite long. For about the same price you could go to the top of the Marina Bay Sands which is higher and in a similar position.,,,
,,Go on ya big kid...,5,,"Look, you know you are going to do it anyway, so why pretend you are only thinking about it by reading reviews?

The impressively sized Singapore Flyer is effectively a massive Ferris Wheel and it takes approximately 30 minutes to go around once. The views are well worth it because they stretch out to sea and also inland - the vista of the business district and especially Marina Bay is quite nice. It actually makes a nice end to one of the city tours available on various websites.

And of course there are plenty of tourist bits and bobs for sale at the store.

Lastly consider (if you have pockets deep enough) the skydiner option.",,,
,,"Must try probably once, but thats it.",3,,Its about 30-40 minute ride that gives you a good view of Singapore. The first 10 minutes is exciting but after a while it gets boring. Must have: photo of you inside the capsule taken by another person from another capsule.,,,
,,"Panoramic view and leisurely ride, but once is enough",4,,"A leisurely 30-min ride on the Flyer gives you the best 270-degree view of Singapore. Go on Mon-Thu day time if you can -- in some cases you may be able to have a cabinet all to yourself/your party if visitors are relatively few. The ride will, as at the Flower Dome, lure you to take an ""official"" photograph at the attraction, and then charge you for it. Just so you know, you can choose not to take the picture and/or not purchase any copies.

To reach the Flyer, take the circle line subway to Promenade station. There is a small shopping centre adjacent to the attraction with lots of food choices",,,
,,A lot of fun and you'll go crazy taking pictures,4,,"This was fun. Go early as you may have a ""car"" all to yourself. You also don't have to spend a lot of time waiting in line or waiting for cars to load/unload. The gift shop was a little pricey.",,,
,,Good place,4,,I been to flyer during my February trip to singapore.. good place to view the skyline of Singapore.. and not over crowded capsules. We went during evening so was amazing to see all the lights.,,,
,,Simply stunning,5,,"We have been on a few of the flyers located around the world and this is definitely one of the best! The pod is air-conditioned with 360 degree unobstructed views over beautiful Singapore. Before you actually get to ride on the flyer the building is created in such a way that the history of the flyer and some interesting facts regarding Singapore is given to you.

Although a night view is great, we went at dusk and was lucky enough to catch the view in both the light and at night, really worth it. At night the lights are spectacular but you miss seeing a lot of the building details visible only in day. If you time it right you start off with a day view and end up with a night view",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,Despite a fear of heights I joined my family on the flyer and was so glad I did. The pods travel around so slowly it's hardly noticeable. The views from the top are simply stunning. Lots of spec in each pod to move around and take in the views from all angles. Not to long a trip either taking about 35 minutes to complete,,,
,,Paisa wasool,5,,About in 30 mins ride give us a superb experience to explore singapore. Its giant ferris wheel and one of the attraction of Singapore. About 15-20 persons in each capsule. It runs through if the weather is good. And nice restaurants at the lower level. you can easily get coffee sandwiches etc.,,,
,,Fly High,4,,"Amazing experience, very first time tourist look at the flyer and think of its speed might make them go crazy, but belive me you wont even feel its moving, the best moment is when you reach the top of the world to have a spectecular view of malaysia on one side indonesia on other, marina bay sands in front of you and lots of ships in the ocean.",,,
,,Nothing Spectacular,4,,"While it may be the world's largest observation wheel, there's nothing special about the views or the experience. It's very similar to the London Eye but being set at the waterfront only gives you a long distance view of the immediate area including the Merlion fountain and the cargo ships in the Singapore Strait. Grounds well maintained and staff very pleasant but a little costly with adult fares at $33 each.",,,
,,An absolute must when visiting Singapore,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is not the highest point in Singapore, but it does provide breathtaking views. There is no stopping and starting. It goes in a continuous loop. From afar it doesn't even look like it is moving. You can see from the Indonesian islands to the south to the Malaysian mountains to the north. The ride is smooth and easy. Each car is spacious and they don't overcrowd you. There was no line when I went. The cost was about US$25 and it was worth the experience. Given that it's the biggest wheel in the world, it is definitely worth the time and cost to experience it.",,,
,,Beautiful views!,5,,"I visited the Flyer at around 4 pm and there was nobody else there. My partner and I got a pod completely to ourselves which was very romantic and also relaxing! The views during the day are excellent, although I've heard at night it is also excellent!",,,
,,Highest in the World!,5,,Beautiful views and a great thing to see the whole city!! There is also a drinks slyer which is in posh capsules. Great time :),,,
,,Make sure you visit this,5,,"Always bring my visitors to the Flyer and everyone of them has enjoyed the experience. The views are amazing and everyone is fasinated when you show them where the beach used to be and that the Flyer is on reclaimed land.

Takes 30 minutes to do this - worth a go",,,
,,What A Way To See The Sights Of Singapore,5,,Well worth the trip to see scope of modern Singapore. You cannot be other than impressed by this great city in South East Asia from the vantage point of the Flyer.......just like the London Eye on which I think it was modeled.,,,
,,Very well run Great Day.,4,,It is one of those must do in Singapore experiences. Well worth the price. The ride it self was very smooth and just enough time to see Singapore from above.,,,
,,Fantastic View of the City,5,,"While the Marina Bay Skypark offers just about the same scenery, I think that the Singapore Flyer offers a better view. You see all of the iconic structures in Singapore in an awesome panorama. It offers the best sunset view of the city. I planned my visit to ensure I was on the flyer when the city starts to light up. And it was definitely worth it. Singapore's sunset normally happens around 7:30 pm, and a good plan is to board the flyer around 7:15. You will more or less be on the top of the Flyer by the time the sun sets. Before you get off, the city would have changed lights to your viewing pleasure. You can move inside the cabin and it moves slowly enough for you to leisurely enjoy each scene. Visitors have options to select a regular cabin or the special ones, which can include dining and drinks. It depends which one you would prefer. The special ones are pricier, of course. From Marina Bay Sands, you can walk up to the Flyer, just follow the Helix Bridge and you'll get there after the street crossing. There's a hawker place at the bottom of the facility, in case you'd like to dine before or after the ride. It's one of the attractions that I think is a must for a visitor.",,,
,,Nice view,4,,"I liked this place and it's probably great for kids as it's a huge ferris wheel. The view is as always a bit obstructed in a ferris wheel, but overall it's a good attraction. If you can time it right, go there when it's time for the sun to set so that you can catch both daylight views and night views. Don't miss the freight ships lying outside in the ocean, that was a nice eyecatcher when it turned dark. The ships slowly became invisble while the lights remained visible, very nice.",,,
,,Imposing Ferris wheel,5,,"Each car is huge, well up kept and very safe. The view is fantastic, you don't feel seasick: just great for the Singapore overview you need.",,,
,,AMAZING VIEW! Postcard worthy!,4,,"My mom is afraid of heights, but we convinced her to ride with us. Each ride is about 30 minutes long, rotation is slow enough where you hardly feel it moving. It's one of those attractions that you have to go on once in your lifetime and probably won't ever do it again.",,,
,,"Wow, the view was amazing",4,,"Just went on the Singapore Flyer and it was fantastic. The view is awesome, and it helps you to work our exactly where everything is from above. You can see Gardens by the Bay, The Sands, back towards the main shopping town, and great view of the F1 circuit. You can also see the Duck, on it's tour past the Sands, and the Merlion.
Well worth, the money.",,,
,,Fly high and see the best of Singapore at the Flyer!,4,,"Get the best sight on top of the Flyer before sunset and see the fascinating city changes it's color before your eyes. When it's time to get off, the city sparkles in it various night lights.",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,Go in the morning on a prepaid ticket and you virtually have the capsule to yourself. Amazing views of Singapore and further afield to Indonesia and Malaysia. The Flyer is right next to the F1 Grand Prix circuit so we were able to see the finishing line and stands. Well worth a visit and reasonably priced.,,,
,,MUST Watch,5,,"This is MUST watch in singapore.. You can view the entire city and also this being the biggest flyer.. it would be very good experience to get into it. By the way, don't be scared, the ride is very slow and you will not even realize that you are moving.. it goes very slowly.

The duration of 1 full ride is 30 mins and you will not even know that it is moving, it is that much slow. So no need to be scared for people who tries to avoid giant wheels.. This is not a giant wheel, you will not even know that you are sitting in such thing. You can walk around here and there.",,,
,,360 View of Singapore,4,,Singapore Flyer is in the Clarke quay area just near the helix bridge. Ride takes around 35-40 Mts. a full round gives the view of Singapore. Though Entry fees @ 33 S$ is a bit pricey yet it is a attraction can not be missed.,,,
,,Nothing More Than a View,3,,"A very simple attraction which I think is a little overrated and pricey for what you get. If you're all about sightseeing and looking at views then it's great, but considering that the ride is about an hour, within the first 20 minutes of taking pictures and admiring the view the novelty wears off fast. Although the experience might not be the same, I'm sure I could get a similar view for cheaper if I went elsewhere in the city.

The observation box is about room size and depending on how many people you go with you might end up sharing with another group if your party is small. It's clean, spacious and simple inside, complete with seating and surrounded by glass windows which offer you a 360 degree view of Singapore. The Ferris wheel moves extremely slow (one ride=one turn) so there's no need to be concerned about motion sickness or belly flops.
There are some places to eat and concessionary stands downstairs (and shops I think), so if you're looking for a small bite to eat there's food available.

If by all means you have some extra cash to spare or just REALLY want to go on it go ahead, but my advice is skip it if you're deciding between attractions to visit. It's really the kind of thing where what you see is what you get, nothing more nothing less. However there are plenty of other cooler, cheaper, and/or more worthwhile things to do in Singapore.",,,
,,Don't like heights,4,,"Was very smooth you didn't know you were moving , Got some lovely pics of marina bay sands etc beautiful view from up there highly recommend.",,,
,,Great View,4,,If you want to see all of Singapore this is the way. I was surprised that we were going so slow that you didn't hardly feel it moving. The cost seemed a little high but there are packages with the hop on buses that make it quite reasonable.,,,
,,Nice view,4,,"I believe you have to try this type of attraction at least once in your life, even for someone who is afraid of height like me. Lol. The view during the night time is just amazing. You can see as far as Batam at Indonesia's side. The waiting line can be too long, especially if you came during school holiday.",,,
,,Was really worth the visit,5,,"At first we thought this was too touristy for us. However, we decided to go with our adult and teenage kids and my Aunty. We are so glad we did.
We caught a River Taxi for $3SD straight to it from Robertson Quay.
The views are amazing, the Flyer Capsules are air conditioned, not overcrowded and ample seating.
We took some fantastic photos and it gave us a brilliant birds eye view of the layout of the city.
So glad we all did this.",,,
,,Worth a visit,5,,"We timed this trip perfectly by the time we got to the top the sun had gone down it was dark and the views were amazing. I wasn,t that pricey either.",,,
,,Awesome,5,,"all things in singapore very expensive,but when im going to singapore flyer its worth it and very awesome, i can saw the view all singapore from singapore flyer",,,
,,Overrated place.,3,,"Yes you can see some of the Singapore from the heights. But so?

Maybe my timing is not perfect. Maybe at night is better. But what will you see at night besides the lights all over the town. Not much different than if you see it from Marina Bay Pool, right?

The entrance fee is expensive too. And lack of privacy, since we have to share with other people too, even though we came with a group of almost 10.

Well, I think 1 time is enough for just try. But if you didn't, you wouldn't miss anything.",,,
,,Worth a visit,4,,You get great views from the shuttles. It takes abot 30mins + to get around and does become a little boring towards the half way mark as you have been looking at the same view for 15 mins but suddenly your on the other side and a whole new view... Definatley a different perspective of the city from here!,,,
,,Twice in a day,4,,"We finally visited this attraction after it was on our to do list for some time.
There are many mixed reviews both online and I have heard from friends & family. Everyone has their own opinions as to whether SF is up their expectations. Well we decided to try it out.
Arrived after lunch on a weekday so it wasn't overly crowded. Found the tickets counter confusing as we were on a different floor. Anyway bought our tickets and took the trip up. I am afraid of heights so I sat still for the first 5 minutes. But soon after I started to enjoy the slow tranquil ride, taking in the many scenes from 165 meters tall.
After 30 minutes we were down on the ground again. Walked around the shops, this place is lacking atmosphere I thought. Anyway found two tour agents near to food courts offering package deals including SF and duck tours. I convinced my husband to do it again but this time in the evening before the sunset. Up we went again just before 7pm....
Now that we have done it we can tick the box and said, ""yes been there and done that."" Would I recommend it? Yes.",,,
,,Great Attraction,4,,"i turned up solo without booking, paid $33 and began the 45-50minute adventure. To start you walk through an exhibit about the making of the wheel, facts and trivia.When reedy i waited in line for five minutes to borad a capsule and start the 30 minute single rotation on the highest big wheel in the world. Views were plentiful and fantastic. I felt safe the whole time",,,
,,Great view over Singapore,3,,"Not cheap but worth a visit, very similar to the London Eye, good view of Singapore. Its not the most exciting thing to do and probably a bit over priced, but if you haven't anything else planned its ok.",,,
,,Our second time around,5,,This was our second time on the Singapore Flyer as we did the first trip during the day. We decided to go and do it again but at night time to see Singapore lights - it was a great decision. The only disappointment was that last time they had a commentary while the flyer was going around but this time this was not available. The view from there is spectacular and also very relaxing. Much nicer at night time.,,,
,,Truly overrated,3,,"I never tempted to join others to ride singapore flyer before, until this time i visit with the 1st timer friend, and we have plenty of free time. It's truly overrated compare with the price and what you can see from the sky. I agree with others reviewer, singapore from the sky was monotonous and it more less worth since the place itself is a bit away from the MRT Station and nothing else around the place but singapore flyer. So i just go get there and back to the crowd which is so much better than spending few bucks on the boring 30 minutes :)",,,
,,Spectacular views,5,,"If like us, you do go via Singapore on the way to other destinations, then you only need to do this once. But it is worth it. Spectacular 360 degrees views for as far as your eyes will see. We waited until our third Singapore visit before embarking on this. Waited for that perfect sunny day and luckily got it on this trip.",,,
,,Overrated,3,,"Can get the same view from the top of any of the tall buildings for none of the same hefty price tag; and honestly from the air, Singapore is pretty monotonous.

Even when there are few people, the staff won't allow you to have a cabin to yourself. I didn't understand this.",,,
,,"If you seen one, you have seen it all",3,,I would call this a waste of time especially if you have been to a flyer like the London Eye before. The 25 minutes ride can be quite boring. Not worth the money for me.,,,
,,A view of the modern city,4,,"The Singapore flier is higher than the London Eye, the cost is I'm told less and the views are fantastic. Singapore is modern city located only 1 degree and 17 minutes north of the equator, much of its infrastructure is below ground, but the architecture above ground is fantastic, much of it being viewed from the flier. The flier is located close to Marina Bay Sands the iconic hotel built on reclaimed land to the south of Beach Road were the famous Raffles Hotel is found, and immediately next to the pits area of the Singapore F1 Gran Prix.
All the pods on the flier have the points of the compass marked on the roof with leaflets with maps which can be orientated it identify all the land marks that you see from the flier. The ride takes approximately half an hour and there a number of options including dining on the flier. We just took the basic ride and thought it we'll worth the cost. A must for anyone visiting Singapore.",,,
,,Excellent Birds eye view,5,,"We had a excellent birds eye view of the Formula One Track, The City and the Back water. Its a must do once. Do try it out once.Ideal for family visits",,,
,,Best views of Singapore,4,,"We didn't go on the flyer ($33.00 entry fee) the last time we were in Singapore so made sure we made the effort this time and it was well worth it. Outstanding views and everyone in the capsule took turns to look at the view, or you can just sit in the middle and enjoy the ride.
There is also an old fashioned hawker centre on the ground floor with a wide variety of food and drink available and a small garden with a waterfall. We were there during Chinese New Year, so there were extra things to look at (such as the chinese animals from the horoscope etc)",,,
,,Do It!,5,,"An amazing view of Singapore, in comfort. This is really worth doing at least once, hang the expense.Once you do this there is no need to try any of the other scenic views, this covers it all.",,,
,,Great View of the city and environs,5,,"Aside from the obvious reason to ride the Flyer (because it is there), the views of the city are magnificent. Choose a sunny day for the best views and if the opportunity arises, do a night ride as well.",,,
,,Excellent,5,,"Lovely area, lots of eating places and central garden area with waterfall, very peaceful. Singapore flyer itself like the London Eye. fantastic views of the city. Should not miss this.",,,
,,A wheel with a view,3,,We wanted to go up high and see Singapore and it was this or the top of the Sands Hotel. This is just like the London Eye and takes about 30 minutes to go all the way round. Apart from insisting that we really didn't want a photo taken before we went on (something that every attraction seems to offer!) this was a nice relaxed way to see the whole of Singapore. My husband spent most of the time trying to work out a) where he had run that morning and b) where the grand prix goes and in what direction.,,,
,,At Last I did it.....,4,,I Have visited Singapore about a dozen times and have always put this off.... I really enjoyed the flyer and it was great to see the city from way up high. thank you,,,
,,a must do,5,,The scenic ride of your life. Dizzyingly high wheel - full glass compartments. Mindblowing view - you can organise a compartment to yourself including dinner (which would be great for couples in lots of interesting ways....),,,
,,Wow!!!!,5,,What a difference to the London Eye. No queues for a start. Only 8 to a pod. We went at night which has to be the best time with the Flyer lit up with constantly changing lights. The views of Singapore at night was fantastic.,,,
,,"A must do, must see !",5,,"Booked online for the discount, used electronic ticket on ipad, can be used anytime on date selected. The 30 minute revolution was steady and an exciting experience from start to finish, the views from the very top were incredible. Would recommend everyone to go.
Afterwards we walked across the Helix bridge to visit Marina Sands hotel.",,,
,,High!!!!!,5,,Great attraction. Suitable for everybody. amazing view. You can take baby prams to the attraction and the staff will look after it for you as you cannot take it inside the pod.,,,
,,Great View from Top,4,,Great view from top. Evening time around sunset will be the best time as the city looks more beautiful with lights. Behind flyer there is one nice place where you can take ice cream and take a long walk. very romantic.,,,
,,"Ok for the view, but is boring for 30 mins",3,,It's a good view from the capsule but gets boring for a 30 min ride. The views are better from marina bay sands park where it's not enclosed and you have the wind blowing. It's ok to miss this one and not spend 33 sgd per person.,,,
,,Beautiful Singapore View at Dawn,4,,"I bought a ticket from a local travel agent cost SGD 25. It says that I have to enter the attraction before 6PM. Too bad I had a prolonged schedule due to immigration and some problem during hotel check-in and arrived 45 minutes late at the ticket counter. I can come in with additional SGD 5. Still a bargain from a published ticket rate of SGD 33. Stroller must be parked and not allowed on board, but the safe system is free.
Before we get to the flyer we enjoy the museum named Journeys of Dreams that have several interactive display with full story of Singapore Flyer. My 4 year old son really interested with the interactive display and media and some interesting art installation.
Then we have a short queue before finally aboard one of the capsule. The capsule still moves very gently when we step in. And it slowly climb to the heights.
The view at the dawn is beautiful. There is a festival at that time (We visited one week after the lunar new year) And the lights and colors from below made a beautiful pictures.
On one time before we completed a round, the capsule completely stop. I can see that they delivering dinner to the dining capsule, next to our.",,,
,,Must visit,4,,The best way to get a birds eye view of Singapore - slow rotation makes it very enjoyable and pleasant for all ages,,,
,,Dec-13,2,,Lousy. The chicken is cold. Looks like cooked and placed aside. The chicken is soaked in oil. The way it is uncooked pales in comparison with those at orchard mrt station. Inconvenient place unless you happened to be there for the flyer.,,,
,,See it all,5,,We went on a Monday and there were no lines at all. If you can I would recommend this on an off time as I think the lines to get on would be long. The ride takes 30 minutes and it is well worth it. You can see most of Singapore. The cost if you are a senior is reduced and that makes it a great bargain. It is one of things you must do in Singapore.,,,
,,Day or night- Good views,4,,"Been there a coupls of times, either day or night views are always good, may depend on personal preference. Lots of dining options there. Flight is of 30min and is worth atleast once. Once of the must see attraction in Singapore city.",,,
,,A great way to see the F1 GP track.,5,,"I arrived in Singapore a couple of days before the F1 GP started and had pre-booked a ride on the Flyer for my first full day there. It was very hard to get to with all of the road closures for the GP, but I got there in the end. The pods are good and the views are really good. What I didn't know when I booked my pre-GP ride was that with the GP ticket I had, I was able to ride the Flyer whenever I liked and for as long as I liked (multiple 'spins'!) during the GP days. I ended up doing a number of spins during practice and even qualifying and even a couple on race day as the Flyer gave me great views of different parts of the track, especially the pit straight.",,,
,,Good view of the city,4,,"The world's largest observation wheel will give you a good look at an amazing city and the Marina Bay. I don't usually like cities but 'The Little Red Dot' is quite amazing, modern, clean and well designed. To get a bird's eye perspective and some amazing photos of the layout of Singapore and some of its iconic buildings, try the flyer at night. We went over Xmas (27 Dec) and there was hardly anyone there and no wait. There is an information walk way to the flyer called 'Journey of Dreams鈥?telling the story of its building. The capsule is large enough for 20 people with pews to sit on and good views for 30 minutes through clean windows. You can get a photo and a t-shirt at the souvenir shop.",,,
,,Fantastic and Romantic Experience,5,,"My wife and I did the Singapore Sling flight at 9:30 on a Thursday evening. We had a great time and were ushered into the VIP car along with just one other couple. My wife has been sampling Singapore Slings around the city on this vacation and she says that was the best one she had. It was my only one, but I agree that it was very good. The view was amazing and the 30 minute rotation was just the right amount of time. Such a wonderful time. We went to the top of the Sands Marina Bay afterwards and enjoyed the Singapore flyer so much more.",,,
,,sky wheel,5,,The views are simply amazing. The wheel takes around 30 minutes to do a circuit and you can see all of Singapore a must do for the traveller,,,
,,Eye for a view,5,,Went through the day great views but would be best of a clear day. Lit up at night looks great very slow so suitable for young and old.,,,
,,Great for a Night Visit,4,,The Flyer moves very slowly so you get about 45 minutes and I agree with what some other reviewers have said that a good time to go is at dusk. It was overcast on the day we visited so we left it a bit later and were able to see the lights from the buildings around Marina Bay. A nice experience and certainly one to put on the things to do list when visiting Singapore.,,,
,,Best view over Singapore,4,,What a great experience. Very well organised there. The capsules are air conditioned very roomy and you can see so much from the top and all around you . What amazed me was that you could not feel it move or hear anything whilst it is in motion. Have been on other Flyers and not so good as the Singapore Flyer. Well Done Singapore.,,,
,,Must-do in Singapore!,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is certainly a must-do. We chose to do the Flyer at night, and wow, it was amazing. Singapore is such a beautiful city. The Flyer takes around 30 minutes to travel full cycle.",,,
,,Superb!!,4,,The view from the flyer is very beautiful! we visited at 6.30...to 7..so we could see it in the day light as well as night...looked amazing!,,,
,,Amazing view of the NYE fireworks!,5,,"I'm a bit tardy in posting my review but it was such a great experience, I wanted to make sure I did get one in.
I was in Singapore solo for 2 nights before meeting up with my daughter and arrived on the afternoon of New Years Eve.
I knew I wanted to see the fireworks at Marina Bay but wasn't so keen on battling the crowds.
While researching things to do in Singapore, I discovered you could do a NYE flight on the Singapore Flyer. I booked immediately and I am so glad I did!! What a fabulous, non stressful way to see all the action, with a glass of Moet in hand...perfect!!
16 per carriage from memory and PLENTY of room to move. The view was beautiful at night and so, would recommend for anytime, not just NYE.
However, it certainly was special on this particular night. We had just passed the apex of the ride when the fireworks began and they finished just as the flight was coming to an end. We had an uninterrupted view of the whole show.
Definitely one of the highlights of my Asian trip.",,,
,,Great views!,5,,"The Singapore Flyer was an included bonus from our Travel Agent. We were pleased that we did this trip and enjoyed the extensive views from the Flyer as it slowly traversed it's circular trip. It is much bigger than the London Eye and has greater setting to it, we would suggest that you pre book as the ticket queue can get long.",,,
,,Champagne ride was great!,5,,"What a nice way to see singapore city! Beautiful at night time, and the Mo毛t was a lovely touch. Would recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore",,,
,,Totally recommend the Singapore Sling sunset flight,5,,"We did a Singapore Sling flight at 8:30pm. Is was worth paying the extra $$, as we went straight to the front of the line and there were only 5 people in our pod. Other pods were packed full of people!! The sunset flight was amazing - the view at the top was great and we got some really nice photos.",,,
,,"Great views, very very high!",5,,"Im not great with heights, but my wife wanted to go on to enjoy the view so I was brave and gave it a go! Going up was the worst bit, and I kind of regretted going on, but once at the top I calmed down and just enjoyed the views, which are stunning! We went on a clear day which meant we could see for many many miles! No lines to wait in, well organised, and not over the top pricing. A must try in Singapore!",,,
,,Singapore's Must Go Place,4,,"Finally I had a chance to ride Singapore Flyer after many years of just watching it under construction.

The experience was great. The wheel moves slowly, giving you a chance to enjoy the scenery. You can see Southern part of Singapore and a little bit of my Indonesian island when you are at the top of it.

Inside the cabin you can move freely from side to side, so it's perfect for taking pictures. Of course as long as there's not many people inside. I visited it during weekday so there was few people and short queue. The staff was very attentive and friendly. There are shops and restaurants around the base in case you feel hungry after the ride.",,,
,,Go in the evening,3,,Good experience . if you want you can get a capsule for your self since there is not much crowed. it is about 45mints ride. there are few more other experiences as well like flight stimulations and etc. i couldn't try those.,,,
,,"Wow, Singapore",5,,"This is one of my favorite attractions whenever I have families or friends visiting Singapore. Night view and Day view are different and both are amazing. With my memory of Singapore 10 years ago and now, you can really feel the hard work done by the government to build up such a beautiful city. You see Kallang River, Raffles Place, MBS, Singapore River, Esplanade, Melion...etc, you are basically viewing Singapore at one sight and it is stunning.",,,
,,Good place,3,,Good view of Singapore. Though liked London Eye better. Good view at night to see Singapore lit up. Expensive at SGD 33.,,,
,,"Great view, similar to the London Eye",5,,This 30 minute ride offers some incredible views. It's similar to the London Eye and is equally enjoyable. I'd suggest visiting slightly off peak. I visited on a Sunday just before dark and got right on. I'd also suggest buying a discounted ticket while on another tour; in my case a City tour.,,,
,,Better than expected,4,,"Singapore Flyer is better than I thought. With all the skyscrapers around I expected that a ride in Singapore Flyer should have been an anti climax, but not. I enjoyed the ride, and doing the trip just in sunset, watching the town turning the lights on during the trip is just an experience. Worth the money.",,,
,,30 breathtaking minutes,5,,Wonderful way to stare at Singapore. This city rocks! Went about 11am. No lines not crowded. Worth the money. Everything here is clean upbeat and very savy.,,,
,,Flyin' High!,5,,We went at nighttime. The Singapore Flyer at over 540 feet tall is the tallest Ferris wheel in the world. It moves slow enough that from a distance the fact that it's in operation is imperceptible. The nighttime views are amazing with a bird's eye perspective of the city lights and the building lights are unique! Some of the cars are even outfitted to host small dinner parties. 30 minutes per revolution.,,,
,,"Looks good,",3,,"It looks ok to me,not that great as had been mentioned in the attractions of Singapore.London eye is equally good.Who is going to measure that this one is the biggest.Paris has also one which looks good.",,,
,,Fantastic Views,5,,"We did this just before 10pm at night. Only 2 other people in our capsule, and fantastic views of the City at night. Believe night would be far better than day. We did this as part of a 2 day pass on Travel Viator. This, and Marina Bay Sands are 2 of the most iconic structures that make Singapore stand out.",,,
,,Good Overview of the city,4,,"It is a good way to see the skyline and harbor. It is $24.00 for a senior, not too bad for a half an hour ride. It moves very slowly, the ride is about 30 minutes. There are some great photo ops.",,,
,,Fabulous Views,5,,"Worth visiting to get such fabulous views of the city. Saw many things we didn't know existed and nice to get an overview of the city layout. Amazed at the huge number of ships waiting to come into port.
We visited on a slightly cloudy day but the view was still amazing. There were no queues.
We were on a Singapore Airlines Stopover and the Singapore Flyer was one of the attractions included free. If flying Singapore Airlines the Stopover package is really good value.
My only minus was the reflections in the windows were occasionally a problem, but with only 3 of us and a family of 4 in the capsule there was plenty of room to move around and get another angle.",,,
,,Must see,4,,"By the time we get to ride on the flyer after queuing for quite a while, it was 7.05pm. Fortunately, the sky was still bright, the views at different angles, AWESOME! Soon, the sky became dark on our way down and we have night scenery all in a single ride! Prefers the day scenary though due to the visibility of many places, even those far away. For night scenary, the area around Marina Bay Sand is pretty due to the lights. The entire ride or flight as they called it, was 30 minutes. Just nice.
Worth visiting! Will certainly ride again.",,,
,,Awesome views,5,,Recommended after sun set for a spectacular view of the city at night. Seating available for about 10 or can stand and enjoy the view from the glass capsule. Fantastic !! Can purchase individual tickets or as a city pass package includes the river cruise and the hop on hop off bus. Cruise is also fantastic if done after sun set. Hop on hop off bus can be done during the day as it finishes sometime around 6pm.,,,
,,worth it,4,,"For the 1/2 hour trip around in the flyer we felt it worth the cost. The view was impressive and when we went no queues or delays. As others have commented, you can see similar views at other locations in Singapore, however the point is the uniqueness of the attraction. We found it easiest to take the MRT and walk the short distance to the Flyer, where we purchased our tickets. Maybe because it was a quiet day, but we had no difficulty purchasing the tickets on the spot instead of through tour companies or hotels. There are some restaurants, cafes, souvenir outlets and a tourist centre where you can purchase tickets for other attractions all located within the complex.",,,
,,"Like the London Eye,and yet not like the London Eye",4,,"30 minute ride. Very smooth. If there is a queue for the ride, they have several interactive activities to keep you entertained. Good view from the top. Good time to go is just at sunset to watch the lights come on in Singapore.",,,
,,Overpriced,3,,"I`d rather do something else for the money payed for this attraction. Great view, but the same you can see from Marina bay sands sky park or from any other high building. Crowded and slow, not convenient. Waist of time and money.",,,
,,What a view,4,,"The singapore flyer, what a view, I think you get the best views in the day time, allow yourself a few hours for although the 'flight' is only 30 mins there are shops and places to eat below. The views are stunning although you get similar views from The Marina Bay Sands hotel and you can walk around viewing the city. The flyer is definatly a place to visit if you are in Singapore.",,,
,,Enjoyable,4,,"Naturally it is a tourist attraction and can be very busy, but if not too crowded is an enjoyable thing to do. It gives good views across the city and a glimpse of the F1 pits. If time is limited maybe it is lower in priority but if you have time it is worthwhile.",,,
,,Enjoyable,4,,"We had a free voucher with Singapore Airlines as part of our stopover package to do this. Very impressed, lots of photo opportunities, it takes about 30-40min to go around so beware that it may be a little longer than you are expecting. The day we went it was raining in Singapore so the view was not fantastic but you can't pick the weather!",,,
,,Nice,3,,"I thought the Flyer was okay. We went at night, so we had a beautiful view of the city. It moves very slowly though...very... slowly.. you'll have lots of time to soak up the city and take lots of pictures.",,,
,,Not so exciting!!!,2,,Had gone to experience the Singapore Flyer but its not that much worth it. Its a slow wheel which gets over in 15 mins and you don't get to experience much.,,,
,,Sunset is best!,4,,We enjoyed our time in the flyer. Great views and good food on site. Go just before sunset to beat the crowd and you can experience the city by day and night! We enjoyed this using our Singapore tourist card which we highly recommend for price reductions.,,,
,,Very comfortable flyer.....,4,,"I've taken the singapore flyer several times already, and it never fails to amuse me or the people i bring along...... specially the kids...... they just suddenly forget about fear of heights because you can hardly feel the movement inside the car. Its very slow and feels very safe, you can just keep on walking to and fro, take pictures and enjoy the sights.......",,,
,,Reaches the heights,4,,This was a pleasant way to spend 30 minutes. A terrific view and such a quiet operation. A bit too gimicky on the way up and certainly over commercialised.,,,
,,Really get a feel for this great city!,5,,What an awesome experience we had on the Singapore flyer! We went up at night and the sights are just incredible. Much better then the London Eye!,,,
,,Fantastic views - loved it,5,,We did this on both of our trips to Singapore and would do it again. The views are spectacular. Would be a great thing to do at night in order to see how pretty Singapore is in the dark,,,
,,the giant wheel,3,,it was nice to see the lights of singapore after sunset. But it was difficult to take pictures as it was already dark. So I recommend to go on this giant wheel during the day.. :),,,
,,Do not miss!,5,,"If in Singapore do not miss this ride. You get a beautiful view of the entire city. Ideal time to get onto it is around 6pm, when you go up in daylight and come down as evening sets in. Gives you the best of both times. Do not miss! Worth every penny spent!",,,
,,Easy to access with great views across Singapore,4,,"We went to the flyer today and found it really easy to buy tickets and enter the facility. The great thing about the Singapore flyer is that there aren't any lines (at least not for us on a Monday morning!) which is quite refreshing when I remember the horrendous lines for the London Eye. We only had 4 other people in our capsule too and the 30 minute trip around gave us plenty of time to capture awesome photos of Singapore from above. The flyer is definitely a ""must do"" when in Singapore and for $33 per adult it's well worth it.",,,
,,A bird's eye view of Singapore.....,5,,"Claimed to be the largest wheel in the world, the 30 minute flight gives a tremendous overview of the city. If you have travelled with Singapore Airlines, the added bonus is that it is free but, even if you have to pay the fare, it is a great experience.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,"My husband and I were very lucky, but we booked to do the Champagne flight and no-one else had booked to do the 8pm one we did so we got a glass of bubbly and a whole pod to ourselves. A great 30 minutes. To be fair even if that hadn't have happened the amazing night time views made it well worth a go on the flyer.",,,
,,Best Flyer in Asia,5,,"I visited Singapore Flyer with my family during Aug 2013, It is great piece of work with excellent workmanship. Only thing missing was there should be more Food & beverages outlets as people come from all over world but we find only local food. Also quality of food was not good.",,,
,,Great to see the city from a bird麓s eye view.,4,,It is higher than the London eye. It is more organized than the London eye. It offers great skyline views and mainly the Garden麓s by the bay. It was great fun.,,,
,,A great view of Singapore,5,,Our experience on the Singapore Flyer was first class. We were lucky to encounter the best weather conditions and we actually chose a time when there was not waiting to board. The Flyer provided great views of Singapore all around. The close up view of the Marina Sands Hotel was great too. We thought the price was quite reasonable.,,,
,,Worth the visit but beware of non-existent offers.,3,,"The Singapore Flyer was a sight to behold in and of itself, and the view was simply breath-taking, both during the day and night.

The food offerings underneath the Flyer made this stop worthwhile.

However, do beware that this establishment is known to not honor its own offer of a discount for repeat visitors. They print their receipts on, what they later claimed to be, paper with an out-of-date offer printed on the back for a 20% discount for returning visitors. This offer was not honored when we went back for a second ride (at night).

For that reason, we will not be visiting again for a long while, and we also rate this attraction ""average"".",,,
,,Best,4,,It takes almost 45 min to complete the round. The view is very much enjoyable and can see a complete singapore. Its goes to such a big hight.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,It was awesome..The whole place looked as if it was a moving photograph. Everything well placed in Scenic frame. Thanks to the slowly moving giant Flyer. But the authorities should consider reducing the cost for the ride. Its a little expensive.,,,
,,Excellent view from the top,5,,"The view from the flyer is simply breath taking especially at night. You can see the veins of the city from the top. It is a 30 mins ride, so you can have a plenty of time clicking pictures. A must see destination in Singapore",,,
,,Stunning views,5,,This is the tallest wheel in the world with the most stunning and breathtaking views over singapore if you want to see the city from the air do this ride you will not regret it absolutely wonderful cannot recommend this to much,,,
,,technically the highest viewpoint in singapore,4,,"it is the tallest observation wheel in the world but stastically what makes it more unique is that at 165meters it is (at its heighest point) higher than the Bukit Timah Hill (164meters)

from such a height, and on a clear day it is possible to see Malaysia and the Indonesian islands.the views are enchanting from all angles as you get harbour views, the down town business district and city views. mobility within the capsule makes all this possible.

every care is taken from the ticketing to the boarding and enjoying the actual flight a memorable experience.

it you do not have time to do many singapore tours, this is one good way to get a good view of the island in one go.

and yes there is a souvenir shop to take home memories and many decent eateries around the facilitiy.",,,
,,Completely overpriced,1,,"For 30 SGD, the Singapore flyer is terribly overpriced for a view and a 40-minute ride. First of all you need to share the ride with around 15-20 people. If you're lucky it'll be less. Maybe only 9 or so of you will get to sit on the seats in the centre of the compartment and the rest will have to stand, ostensibly at the edges looking out.

I cannot fault the view, of course, but paying 30 bucks for this is absolutely ridiculous, considering you can get a similar good view for as long as you like by going to Pinnacle@Duxton at nearby Tanjong Pagar and heading to the top floor. You do need an EZ-Link card though (1 per person, so a little inconvenient) but considering you only pay 5 bucks for a view (and you get to stay as long as you like and sit and stand if you so wish) the Singapore flyer is truly a rip-off.",,,
,,Excellent views,5,,"Really good value experience that gives panoramic views of the quays and the bay.
I especially liked the view of the Grand Prix roads from a different perspective.
Being a GP fan I was keen to watch the next race and recall my visit.
Some nice restaurants at the bottom.",,,
,,Worth the ticket price,4,,"We found it hard to believe that the Flyer is higher than the London Eye but apparently it is 30 metres taller. It is just a trick of the eye as In Singapore the wheel is surrounded by tall and very tall buildings while around the London Eye the buildings are more low rise. So for the moment, it remains the highest observation wheel in the world, which may or may not rock your world. We decided at the last minute to try it and easily purchased a ticket and were on board with virtually no waiting, so it seemed a fairly slick operation. The views are quite spectacular, even on the greyish day we were there, it's just a shame the windows weren't cleaner. But on the whole a decent tourist attraction worth the not insubstantial entry fee.",,,
,,FLYING FOOD,5,,"Loved the experience, great views also caught a fireworks show while on it. Food was ok, nothing to die for but it was a lovely memorable experience for our 20th Anniversary.",,,
,,View is amazing,5,,Even if your scared of heights I recommend this. You cant even tell your moving around and the view is fantastic I took so many photos and when I got home and downloaded them I loved them all. A great thing to do for the view.,,,
,,wow!!,5,,"that's great: a wonderful view. from there you can see an incredible skyline! do not miss this! I suggest to get there in the morning, so you have time to spend some hours at Marina Bay's garden, that is also fantastic!",,,
,,The Flyer - never on a rainy day....,2,,"I have always wondered why every country must have a Flyer. So, when a friend extended an offer to buy online for a visit to the Flyer as a Christmas gift, I gleefully accepted it. We checked with a local when was the best time to ride it and was told afternoon, as on a clear sunny day we could see as far as the tip of Johor's state of Malaysia.

As we were walking towards the site, it started to drizzle. Now, online tickets are to be used on the date of purchase, with no exchange. We went there on a weekday, there was only a handful of visitors.

After the entrance, there were some exhibitions display on how the Flyer was built and when. We walked along the platform to queue to alight the cubicle. The Flyer moved very, very slowly. Even though there were fencing along the platform leading to the alighting spot, there were none right after. The staff acting as guides when to step onto the cubicle, without stopping. There was no net below.

I was really excited. The cubicle could accommodate about 17 to 20 people with some bench-like seats, with 360 degrees 3-dimensional view. As the wheel turned, the rain started to get heavy, and the sky turning dark. Yes, all the photos that we took of any views have droplets as a backdrop because they stayed on the glass. What a bummer!

When we reached the top, the Flyer stopped longer for visitors to take in the view. I could only see grey sky and dull buildings. Think the ride lasted about an hour, but it was the longest ride ever.

Perhaps the night view is recommendable, but then, the thought of another uneventful ride is not on my list.",,,
,,amazing,5,,"I enjoyed a Very interesting experience ,This offer a great view but 80 Dollars ticket sound to much.",,,
,,Giant Ferris Wheel,5,,So it is one huge ferris wheel of course the scenery and view will be breathtaking. I gather if you've been up once you've done it all so you must at least go up at least once when you are in Singapore.,,,
,,technically the highest viewpoint in singapore,4,,"it is the tallest observation wheel in the world but stastically what makes it more unique is that at 165meters it is (at its heighest point) higher than the Bukit Timah Hill (164meters)

,,Giant Ferris Wheel,5,,So it is one huge ferris wheel of course the scenery and view will be breathtaking. I gather if you've been up once you've done it all so you must at least go up at least once when you are in Singapore.,,,
,,Good views of town,4,,Pleasant views over town and the ships out in the bay. Not the cheapest of activities but probably little different from other world cities. Reasonably long ride and they don't stick too many in a cabin so able to wonder round getting different views.,,,
,,Wonderful views,4,,"Did this instead of going up marina sands,very good value for money,they even sorted us in a pod with just 2 other people views spectacular especially the formula 1 race circuit pit area,",,,
,,Super views of Singapore (and beyond),4,,"The Singapore flyer is currently (to be surpassed later this year I believe) the tallest observation wheel in the world. It is well positioned to give you great views across Singapore (and beyond on a clear day).

We went during the day, and enjoyed our ""spin"". I would also like to go at night in future, although we weren't keen to line up with the kids.

It's the location and lines that stop it being a 5* attraction in my view. They could have done a little more with the remaining on-site facilities.",,,
,,Amazing!!!,5,,"I booked day before Mo毛t & Chandon ride, which was little more expensive, but it included glass of Champagne and strawberries+chocolate and what's most important, there was just me and my wife in the cabin! Ride was smooth, cabin quite large and views were breathtakingly amazing. Be sure you don't miss this!
Important tip:Ride takes about 30min and our started 7pm, which is the best time, because first there is a little sunlight, but then minute after minute it's getting darker and lights begin to show all around Singapore",,,
,,world talest flyer,5,,great experence to have ride in world tallest flyer.You can see singapore image from in it and it was awesome.,,,
,,Worth having a look at it.,4,,"I have been to the Singapore flyer but unfortunately on a rainy day , which makes it difficult to observe from top of the flyer.

I did have a wonderful experience in watching the Singapore city from such high altitude , but its worth going to the flyer at night and when there is no rain.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"We were fortunate enough to time our visit to cover the period of the sun setting, so we got to see the views in twilight and also see the city lights. I'd never been on a flyer before and expected to be petrified, but the ride is so smooth and the cabin so spacious and solid feeling that you barely even realised you were moving, or up so high.

The brochure they give you points out what some of the things are that you are looking at, we did not realise this until afterwards and felt quite stupid when we realised it answered some of our questions!

A great way to see spectacular views of Singapore.",,,
,,Must do!,5,,"When you are in Singapore you have to ride the Flyer twice - once in the day and again at night.

The views are outstanding and will give you a great overview of Singapore.

Don't forget that the tourist loop buses leave from here, which are a great way of getting around.",,,
,,Great Views,5,,"If this is within your budget, do it. You won't get the same kind of view of the city elsewhere, and the museum before hand is quite unique. You can also have dinner on the wheel if you feel the need to step it up a notch.",,,
,,Beautiful view,5,,"I went there last night on 25/01 the view was beautiful. ....I'm afraid of high so this is very exciting for me....after the ride we went for dinner at the food court on ground floor.... bbq stingray,clamp and pipes with a beer...best night",,,
,,What a great experience!,5,,"It is absolutely worth taking this half hour ""flight"" - best at nightfall when you get an unforgettable view of the Singapore skyline all illuminated.",,,
,,A must do to see the sights...,4,,"We had a great trip on the Singapore Flyer and it cost $72 for the two of us and I would recommend it if you are in the City. We also left it until early evening to visit, this way we saw the sunset and lights of the city.
Underneath the Flyer there is an eating place where the locals go and we would thoroughly recommend the food. There are some basic stalls and tables and chairs, so you are going local but the food is very reasonably priced and very good - we would recommend you try it out.",,,
,,City view,4,,My wife and I rode the flyer at night. We went to get a night time view of the city. It is a bit pricy but worth doing once. The view is amazing from the top of the wheel. I would not recommend this for small kids as they will get bored. Also not for people with a fear of heights. Something you should do at least once when you visit Singapore.,,,
,,Singapore highlight,5,,This is one of those activities that you will just have to visit in Singapore. It is much more interesting than a trip on the London equivalent. The centre is well planned with various activities that can also be done and the views from the top are stunning. Not to be missed.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Worth going once to have a view from top of Singapore city. Would take around 90 minutes to complete the tour. Best for the people who like photography, as it provides a chance to take some nice images from top.",,,
,,"very high, good view",4,,"I forget to mention that I am afraid of height..so I was a bit scared when my friends asked me to go. But once I was up, the view was very very nice... A must go if you were in Singapore.",,,
,,Brilliant views.,5,,Magnificent views across the city. We went at night and it was lovely. The cabins are air conditioned and comfortable. Expensive but worth the investment. There is a family ticket that saves you some money but it only covers one child... that suited us but most families we know have at least two children!,,,
,,Unmissable!,5,,very well-organised- we walked straight on. Loved the views all over Singapore. Capsules feel very secure- not scary even for people who don't like heights.,,,
,,"Good view of the city, a nice experience.",5,,"If you have time and money to spare, this is one great attraction. It is so known that when people know you went to Singapore, they will either ask you if you visited Sentosa, Universal Studios, Marina Bay or the flyer. However, it may be a litlle too expensive for families with only one person paying for the whole group. Tip is to search for promos like package (with other attractions) or airline discounts. The ride is about 30 mins and the best time would be around 5:30-6:30 pm, sunset since night time, the view can be a bit too dark.",,,
,,Great view,5,,"Quite heavy priced but then Singapore is now on par with Australia and other first world countries in terms of costs. Actual ride is very smooth and even if you suffer from vertigo you do not feel scared. View of the city, harbour and ships on anchor is amazing as is the view of the Marina Bay Sands and surrounds. Worth doing if not done before.",,,
,,nice but not a must.,3,,"If you have ever been on a 'flyer' before then you know what to expect, it's a nice ride if you have spare time whilst seeing the city and a fun event if you are with your family. However, I feel in Singapore it is quite overpriced considering that you could walk round the corner and see the same view from the top of Marina Bay Sands or One Altitude (and even have a nibble and drink whilst you do)! So, if you don't have kids with you then i would head to the rooftops instead, you see just as much and can take as much time as you want. In fact if you are looking for iconic pictures of the city then i would highly recommend taking them from there rather than through the glass of the flyer.",,,
,,unusual experience,5,,"I can't say it's cheap - we paid for 2 appr 60 SGD. But it's worth going there if you are the first time in Singapore. In that case you could see Gardens of the Bay, wonderful Marina Bay Sands, Marina Bay and port. The Flyer is moving very slowly allowing you to look and make photos and videos. If u want you can turn on the audio with explanations or leave music playing.
If you are hungry - on the first floor there are quite good chinese cafes (accepting cash ONLY). All in all my recommendations",,,
,,Nice View,4,,"It was the theme to see Singapore as the bird eye-view. It went very slow but good for whoever thot that they scare about the speed and high view.

We have a nice time to take many photos, and make friends. Cause not only us but that capsule able to sit more than ten at one time.

Enjoy",,,
,,Good 360-degree views of the city!,4,,"excellent views of the city, best time to visit is just before sunset - so that you get a feel of both the daytime and night views (both are unique to each other). Admission ticket of $33 is a bit on the higher side as compared to other (and better) attractions in SIngapore, but still worth a visit.",,,
,,"Fun, fun, fun",5,,"Be sure not to miss this attraction, both day and night. It is possible to take lunch up with you and enjoy it while taking in awesome views of the city and surrounding area.",,,
,,"Money flyer 鈥?not great value for money, good to see",3,,"We set forth to this attraction with high expectations based on the reviews. But must say we were a bit disappointed. Part of it could be because we landed up on a rainy day in the night after it was dark. Maybe it would be good when you visit during the day.
The attraction is quiet pricey : it charges 80+ Singapore $ for adult and some 30+ singpore $ for kids for a 45 mins rotation. If you are flying Singapore airlines, show your boarding pass to get 20% discount, very helpful. The good thing was that there were no long queues and given 28 people can be accommodated in a single flyer, it was well managed. But we could not enjoy it much given there were rain drops on the flyers and we did not get much a view of the city. We did manage to get to see some of them but didn鈥檛 feel too satisfied. One suggestion would be to have a tour guide through the flyer that can play and indicate different venues /views that one would experience.
Recommend people visit the attraction in the day time or when there are no rains in the night.
One more suggestion that given the pricey ride, atleast we get the picture taken provided as a compliment

Good one to explore but not super impressed",,,
,,don't miss this ferris wheel,5,,"I usually get nervous about heights, but I am glad I went on this ride. It did not seem like it was so high -165m. The views were fantastic. Don't miss this experience.",,,
,,Great views from the top of the Flyer,5,,We went on this on New Year's Eve - it was a dull and cloudy day but we still had great views all around. This is bigger than the London Eye and it took 1/2 hr to do the circuit. Well worth the money and I recommend this highly.,,,
,,I hate heights.,5,,I'm not too comfortable with heights and this did not disappoint. Very comfortable and slow ride. View good. Would highly recommend.,,,
,,Great views,4,,"Great attraction in Singapore, very efficiently run, smooth operation, great views and a very fun way to spend half an hour. There were no queues on the day we went, so we walked straight on. There is a food court attached to the building if you are feeling peckish. It's a surreal feeling when you are at the top, with. O point of refer Eve it seems as though you are not moving at all but of course you are. Very enjoyable.",,,
,,Incredible views,5,,I'm terribly afraid of heights so I was worried about going on the flyer . No worries needed! The room you're in with about 6 other people is very secure feeling and the movement is nearly undetectable. You can sit or stand to take pictures and walk around. It's a view you can't get anywhere else so don 't miss it!,,,
,,Great View of the City,4,,"We really enjoyed seeing the sights of the city from the Singapore Flyer. The air was very hazy, but we could see a lot anyway. We bought our tickets in conjunction with our Hop On Hop Off (HOHO) Bus ticket at the Miramar Hotel which was cheaper than buying them separately (26 SGD as opposed to 33SGD). The ride is very slow and gentle and they only put 8 of us in each car, so we all had a great view. We got there via the HOHO.",,,
,,Great Views,4,,Not frightening at all goes round really slow try not to get in a pod with lots of kids they run around shouting well worth the price,,,
,,just okay,3,,Boring but new and modern Luckily it was not busy - would not wait in queue for this 'attraction' Steril and unexciting as much of Singapore,,,
,,bigger than the London Eye? i prefer the latter.,3,,"is there a need to pay $33 for a 30 minute ride?!? Well , i rather pay $22 to enjoy the view from the Marina Bay Sands Skypark because it is visually more attractive than to sit inside a glass capsule....",,,
,,Phenomenal View,5,,"For a fabulous view of Singapore, in addition to a lovely, serene half hour ride, this is the place to go! You can see all of Singapore, 360 degrees, and get beautiful pictures. The capsules you ride in are large, have benches for sitting, but big enough for walking all around. This is a top of the world experience and must do in Singapore.",,,
,,AWESOME!,4,,"Such a nice ride. You may see almost the whole Singapore...Nice view from top. But they will close it, if it's raining...",,,
,,A terrifying thrill!,5,,"Im not one to cope with heights, so after 3 visits to Singapore and refusing to go each time, I finally did it on our last trip. Absolutely terrified, I thought I was going to be sick as we were getting ready to board, it doesn't help that the flyer doesn't stop so you have to get in as its moving! Kids and hubby LOVED it, I however sat on the bench in the middle of the capsule and didn't move! I kept telling the kids to sit down and stay still hahaha such a worry wart! But really I shouldn't have been scared because you cant even feel anything. and it moves so slowly that really you don't even realise anything. It takes 30 minutes to do the full turn and time did go by very quickly. The views are beautiful and hubbys photos showed me what I woudl have seen had I got up and looked! We went down quite late at night, around 8pm I think and it wasn't very busy so we had a capsule to ourselves. I think you can have up to 25 people in a capsule, they are very roomy and airconditioned. Definatley worth going, and enjoying the views! And if you go in the day you can see as far as Malaysia across the water",,,
,,Boring,3,,The view is nice. You can enjoy the Singapore skyline from here. The only problem is that I find it quite boring. It moves really slow and I simply lose interest on my way up to the top. But when I reached the top I marvel the city again with bright lights beaming. It was really nice. Then slowly I have to see the same things over and over again for such a long time much more than I can take. I guess this will be good for kids. But definitely not for me.,,,
,,Great view of Singpaore,5,,This was worthwhile and great view of the whole city. Trip takes about half an hour and if you flew with Singapore airlines make sure you show your boarding passes when purchasing tickets at the counter to take advantage of an additional discount.,,,
,,Feels great to be on top of the world!,5,,"We rode on this attraction on our 4th day in Singapore. The Singapore Flyer is a unique experience for us, especially to my kid brother. The ticket booth did not have a significantly long line when we arrived (we arrived at 10:00 in the morning so it would not be too hot to ride the flyer). Before you get to the wheel, you're entitled to a pre-ride attraction entitled The Journey of Dreams wherein you'll get to know more about the Flyer before we headed up to where the wheel is.

That was where the queue started. We lined up for our turn to get a compartment. Each compartment holds about 10-15 persons I think, so the officials were loudly asking the customers how many of them were in a party so they could fit them all in a compartment. We queued for like five minutes before we finally went inside.

For like 15 minutes, we were all just seated or standing occasionally taking pictures with the Singapore skyline as background. and when we reached the maximum height, a voice-over announced that we were on top of the world. We all cheered like crazy.

Riding the Singapore Flyer for 30 minutes was a very pretty experience indeed. It was like seeing Singapore from a whole different perspective. We all thought about riding at night because some said it would yield prettier views, but we finally decided on a morning ride. You won't see flying birds, cloud formations and jet vapors on night rides.

After the ride, we all went to look for a bathroom (lesson learned: we should have gone before the ride) and ate at the Singapore Food Trail, a hawker center with a unique theme and decor located at the bottom of the Flyer. The prices there were not overboard. They also had a garden area there but we didn't explore it.",,,
,,Amazing night veiws,5,,"What an amazing experience ... The speed of the ride in the air conditioned capsule gives you enough time to take heaps of photos, plus time to just soak up the view. We did the ride at night & the 360 degree view of the city was just breath taking .. A must do while your in Singapore.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,165 meters above Singapore the Flyer gives you a fantastic view of everywhere!!! Bit scary but definitely a must-do when in Singapore.,,,
,,Spectacular view of Singapore @ Flyer!!,5,,"Singapore Flyer is one humongous giant wheel built on similar lines of Britain鈥檚 鈥淟ondon Eye鈥? It offers spectacular view of the entire Singapore like marina bay etc. throughout its ride which lasts roughly about an hour.
Each 鈥渂erth鈥?on the flyer is designed to contain 10-12 persons. The ordinary berths are just observatories while there are some special ones in which you can dine a well. Talk about a candle light dinner with your loved ones @ 165 meter above the ground!! Ooo La la!!
Personally I think the best time to visit the Flyer would be in the evening just prior to the sunset. So that you can get to have a spectacular view of the city while the daylight still lasts and later you also get to see the city in glittering night lights once Sun goes down the horizon.
Surely a must visit of every tourist!!",,,
,,Amazing Bird's Eye View of Singapore,5,,"I wasn't too keen on doing this at first but my husband insisted, and I'm glad that he did. We had excellent weather that morning, there were no long lines, and we had fantastic views and photos.

Please note, however, that although Singapore is protected from typhoons, the country apparently gets lots of thunderstorms and lightning. They don鈥檛 let tourists go up in the Flyer when that happens, so our first attempt was aborted. good thing the weather cooperated the next day.",,,
,,It's all in the timing,4,,"You can buy your ticket early and it is valid for any time that day. $33 or about 拢15 will get you a 30 minute trip and if you time it right you get the benefit if the last few rays of sun and the night skyline coming to life. Unless you have a great camera, night shots are difficult due to the lights on the flyer reflecting off the glass. Great views of the F1 start/finish straight, across the river to gardens on the bay, helix bridge, marina bay sands hotel and of coarse the cityscape. Champagne reception and capsule dining available too. Plenty of restaurants at the base if there is a queue and you want to wait in comfort.",,,
,,Loved the Flyer!,5,,"Brilliant views for 30 minutes! I enjoyed it way more than watching Singapore from the top of Marina Bay Sands. It was great to see the Air Science Museum & Gardens by the Bay from the Flyer. Besides, the Food Trail was great and we got excellent local tours from the tourist info centre there.",,,
,,This is worth it. Don't listen to anyone who says it isn't.,5,,"Okay鈥t is a giant wheel with excellent views of Marina Bay and skyscrapers. What else do you want?

I would recommend going during sunset so you can get light and night views of the city. It takes about 30 minutes for one revolution.

One of the most memorable things we did in singapore. Pricey but worth it.",,,
,,Must do if in Singapore,5,,"For about 30SGD this is well worth it. It moves incredibly slowly, so it doesn't feel too scary if you're scared of heights. The mechanics and engineering that went into the Flyer are amazing. From the Flyer you can see a great view of a large portion of Singapore including Marina Bay Sands, part of the F1 track and a great view over the bay.
All up the ride takes about 45 minutes. You need to be relatively quick getting on and off the Flyer. Would need to be prepared if you had someone in a wheelchair or a pram with you!
You can take your camera and take your own photos while on the Flyer. As you enter the Flyer there's a touristy photo opportunity that you can purchase at the end of the trip on a variety of backgrounds. If you wear a lime green shirt the same colour as the photo booth background it will look like you're topless in the end photo! haha I suggest you trick your friends into wearing a green shirt!",,,
,,Best Ferris wheel,5,,"Typical Singapore efficiency. Biggest and best in the world. Easy check in process, outstanding views, reasonable value.",,,
,,New Years Eve Spectacular,5,,"We booked early to go on the Flyer for New Years Eve and were not disappointed - we were right at the top when the fireworks went off and it was spectacular.
Well run and organised event just a shame they didn't arrange for the usual photo opportunity as this one would have been worth buying",,,
,,Panoramic Views,4,,"While so many large cities have a 'wheel' these days, the Singapore Flyer is still worth having a look at. It's so big, the trip is a good length and the view is exceptional. We went at night and it was beautiful. You can see all over Singapore and up to Malaysia and across to Indonesia. We were worried that the crowds would be bad, but were pleasantly surprised. It is a very efficient operation. Enjoy!",,,
,,beautiful view,5,,even though it is 34$ singapore dollars it is still worth it. great viw in the evening I went at 9pm my friend and I had the entire glass box to ourself it was nice to just relax and see the night view of all the lights of the city. Do this on your trip it's worth it,,,
,,A Dinner to Remember,5,,Well crafted dinner for family on new year's eve inside the pod was an out of the world experience. Whole family enjoyed the evening. Well managed from start to finish by an efficient team.,,,
,,Wouldn't wait but if there's no line...,4,,"...it's a great way to see the skyline, pass a little time and appreciate Singapore. We were fortunate that there was no line so we bought our ticket and boarded. Pleased with the view and glad we did it.",,,
,,High tech ferris wheel,5,,Great way to see the city reasonable cost and easy access to the venue by cab or tourist bus. Photographers are spoilt for subjects as you slowly and smoothly travel on this state of the art ferris wheel. Note those who travel by Singapore Airlins can get free travel on the participating city tour buses if they show their boarding pass stubs.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"This is an excellent way to get the best views of the city. Situated near the Gardens by the Bay, it is a good starting point to a sightseeing tour.",,,
,,Yes,5,,"This is a must as you can see all of Singapore from this ""Flyer"" A panoramic view of the City. worth the time.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,The Singapore Flyer is the tallest in the world at 165 metres high and well worth the ride. The price is a bit high but still worth it for the view,,,
,,If only the period of a cycle is a little longer,4,,"I loved the night sceneries more!!! This is the second time, first time was during day time. Nice and clear view of basically everything. Night view is beautiful. Spent with a big group of friends, Took plenty of pictures, but time passes really fast..

If only the price could be reduced a bit more, or maybe price specially for students no matter from local uni or overseas uni.

Would loved to go another few times, with different group of people.",,,
,,Great views pleasant hour,4,,"This proved to better than expected.great views if you go early before afternoon showers come in or on a clear day. We took our wheelchair bound relative, and were able to get her in the pod relatively easily as they slowed the flyer down to allow this. Great views of city. They have evening dinners which are pricey but I would do this next time just for something different to do. Only problem was queuing to get in, wheelchair people can't get through turnstyles so you have to be taken round to ramp area at back, this suited us fine. It's a little walk from train station so be prepared for this. Restaurants downstairs are ok.",,,
,,A good way to relax,4,,"After a day at USS, spending some 30 mins at the Flyer is a good way to relax. I'm generally not a fan of these high height rides, but the Flyers is not scary at all. If you go in a non-peak time, they even let your party have your own car which is fantastic! The insides are well air conditioned and feels nice.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"During our recent trip to Singapore we went and rode the Singapore ""Flyer"". This ferris wheel on steroids was an interesting way to view the city skyline, harbour, Gardens By The Bay and the Marina Bay area in general. It is a good site to visit and gives you uninterrupted views in either direction....towards Changi Airport as you go up and to the opposite direction as you reach the apex and begin the descent to the bottom. TIP: I would also suggest not to go to the sky gardens at the top of Marina Bay Sands hotel as the view is exactly the same....why spend the extra money unneccesarily?! (This was advised to us by one of the ticket sellers at the sky park when we asked.). All in all a great attraction.",,,
,,For the View..,5,,"Great attraction, best pics and stunning views of Marina Sands and the City of Singapore. If your'v done the London Eye, now do the Singapore Flyer...",,,
,,Great View,5,,Well if for no other reason you have to ride so you can say you were on the tallest Farris Wheel in the WORLD!!! You do get a great view and the price isn't bad. You can also do it in a package tour with some other things.,,,
,,Largest in the World !!,5,,This is a must must visit on your trip to the city. Especially the museum is very informative. You get to see an amazing view of City. At the highest point you feel as if you are at the highest point of Marina Bay. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience.,,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,Visited early on a Sunday morning. Clear blue sky day. Best views as the capsule slowly rotates. A different experience to the Skypark visit. Excellent value and photo angles.,,,
,,Pricey,3,,Very pricey for a ferris wheel ride. The cabins are large and will comfortably sit and stand 10+ people. Other than that...ferris wheel...just the usual,,,
,,Day 1,4,,"I recommend going on the flyer as one of the first things you do in Singapore, purely because it provides you with a good idea of how the city is set out.

The views are great and if you have a good camera you could capture the entire city from the flyer. it's perhaps of the pricey side, but I really enjoyed the experience.

There were no queues when we arrived and we bought our tickets once we got there. It's a no stress, very quick and enjoyable way to view the city.

We went during the day and I'm tempted to do it again at night. I think the lights throughout the city would make it a fantastic view at night.",,,
,,Well paced ride with a great view of Singapore,4,,This was a great idea and must admit was better than other similar structures across the world. It was a good ambience and the flyer was also timed well ie to go slowly. The pace was right and thanks to a bright day we had a great view of the city. The guide in the flyer was also very good as it gave a list of places across the directions and one could use the compass in the flyer to chk the same. Overall well arranged view of Singapore,,,
,,Flying at Night,5,,"Wow what an awesome experience.
We took our daughter and two grandchildren aged 7 and 4 on a night ride, and it was amazing.
The views are certainly breath taking, and well worth the money. Definitely one of the things NOT to miss while visiting Singapore.
A day time viewing maybe on the cards next visit.",,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"You really must have a go on this half hour attraction, especially if you can time it so you enter a capsule at dusk.

The views are spectacular the whole way around and it feels very safe and sturdy. Try not to get trapped in one with a crying child though - that wasn't great!",,,
,,Average,3,,Pretty average. Better to go for views on marina bay sky deck. Still worth checking out if u have plenty of spare time. Photos dont come out well at night with flash.,,,
,,Go just before dusk,5,,"Time your visit in such a way you reach before dusk, perhaps around 6.30pm/7pm local time. If you are lucky, you may just get to see the sunset. The views are equally captivating whether day or night. Take note to go on a clear day to get the best views. A must do when in Singapore!",,,
,,Biggest in the World!,5,,"Great, really enables you to get a birds eye view of the city. I have been on the London Eye but the Flyer is bigger than the Eye and is currently the largest of its kind. Good value, a must do.",,,
,,Views to thrill,5,,"The views over the whole of Singapore can be seen from the flyer and this is a must attraction at not such a big cost, you can also chose to go in the Mo毛t champagne section at extra cost and toast a drink with friends of you want to do it in style.",,,
,,Worth the loop,4,,"Great view and good service. You get a similar view from the top of the Sands, but there's nothing like a big Ferris Wheel!",,,
,,Really recommend this ride,4,,"When you are riding on it you will feel that the time pass very fast. From Singapore Flyer view, you can enjoy the top view of Singapore there.",,,
,,Nice place to view Singapore,5,,"It is worth the money you spend if you really enjoy viewing Marina Bay Sands , Garden By the Bay & the rest of Singapore skyline from the top.",,,
,,Great View,4,,Slow moving - but extraordinary view. Great chance to see the city. Worth your time if you want to get a sense of the size and development of Singapore.,,,
,,Great Views of the City,4,,"Just arrived in Singapore , quick sling at Raffles and up the Singapore Flyer before dark , great views of the botanical gardens , the harbour , city and formula 1 track finishing line .
My only regret is not doing it at night although we were fortunate that there were no people waiting and we had a pod to ourselves 165metres above the ground , this does not count in my book as an adrenaline rush and I cannot imagine even the timidest person being afraid of this ride as it moves very slowly with no rocking or vibrations . Air conditioned , equipped with a compass in the roof and two screens informing you of events . Normally when a photograph is taken at the start I avoid purchasing the rather posed looks, but in this case do have a look as they do a good job of superimposing you onto good backgrounds .",,,
,,Boring,2,,"Just wondering how long you can stand riding the flyer. After seeing the entire Singapore, you feel like you want to go down. The flyer moves very slow and there's not much to see after the round. I really do not fancy it that much. I guess for kids this will be a treat, but I really do not recommend it for impatient adults like me.",,,
,,NICE,5,,"Amazing view from the flyer !! good picture stops available.. the capsule type of seating in the flyer is comfortable. if u haven't been to london eye, this is something u can't miss !!",,,
,,fab views,5,,Loved the views and despite being afraid of heights I felt perfectly safe. Hated the screaming kids charging round the capsule. Parents.........please control your children!!!!!!!!,,,
,,great at night,4,,Done this at night and you can see the whole city lit up was spectacular and only 30mins so enough time to see everything.,,,
,,Great ride!,5,,Definitely worth going on this. I was able to get some great pictures of the bay and the cityscape. This is the tallest ferris wheel in the world.,,,
,,Nice view,5,,We went on the flyer from 6:00 pm. It was the good time to enjoy the sunset and Singapore at night. Love it,,,
,,Great views,4,,We were flying Singapore Airlines and so got a great discount but even at full price it is something you should do once at least. Great views and great photo opps,,,
,,Don't forget your Camera,5,,"We went on the flyer at night and pre booked on line the trip including a cocktail

We shared our carriage with only one other couple there were no queues and we jumped straight on, the staff were increddibley helpful

The views are incredible so dont forget your camers",,,
,,Champagne Flight,5,,"I booked this as a gift for my husbands birthday in December but due to a storm it was cancelled. Fortunately we were able to re book for January and I am so pleased we were able too as it was an amazing experience.

We shared the pod with just one other couple so had uninterrupted views and took some incredible photos as well as enjoying the champagne. The whole experience from checking in at the lounge to being escorted to embark was well managed and worth every cent.",,,
,,"Great, Cheap & No Queues, Surprising",5,,"We went as part of the Singapore Airlines stop over package which gives you a free ticket and 20% discount for anyone with a boarding pass but not on a stopover package into singapore using their official carrier - very useful to know if you didn't already! $26 is the price I paid, my mrs got in for free.

We went on the 4th Jan, no queues around 11am and we walked straight into a pod with around 6 other people which allowed us to walk around freely and take photos. Great views, tallest wheel in the world and you get a good 30 minutes.

Recommend as a place to go, we got a $5 taxi from Swissotel Stamford.",,,
,,Great Fun.,5,,"I was impressed with how quicly to queue moved to get a seat on the flyer. I think we were seated about 10 mins after buying a ticket.
The view are specatular as you'd expect and the whole experince was first class.
Well Done Singapore Flyer",,,
,,Fantastic - Singapore must-do,5,,"Just a short walk from Promenade MRT. While the price seems steep at first, the flyer gives spectacular views of the whole city and is well worth every cent of the entry price. Not much to see in the post flight souvenir shop, but the cafes and restaurants below the flyer are quite nice.",,,
,,exciting,5,,it was a surreal experience that lasted thirty minutes.beautiful birds eye view of singapore.we had our dinner there which was nice..overrall its something you have to experience when in singapore,,,
,,Too expensive for what it is...,3,,"Well yes it's a great way to see the city from above. But it's expensive for a very slow and a bit boring ride.
If you have the time (more than four five days) go for it. If not, the are much better things to do.",,,
,,Round and Round we go,4,,"Brought my China friends up to the flyer for a visit. As per all Observation wheels, they bring to you elevated views of a country. The Singapore flyer takes 30min for each round. But to me, the best thing about Singapore flyer is the Singapore food street over there. It is very comprehensive and sells wonderful Singapore local food, albeit at a higher price BUT the quality is really good! Would recommend all tourists there for a taste of Singapore food if you only have 1-2 days here and you have too many places to go!",,,
,,Don't Miss this attraction while in Singapore,5,,"For S$ 33 per adult this attraction is a must and should not be missed while in Singapore.
It is an half an hour ride on the flyer but the view is fantastic of the city skyline.
After that walk it up to the esplanade and merlion for the rest of the evening.
Recommended time would be between 5pm to 7pm and then proceed to Merlion to see the Sound and Light show at 8 pm from the Marina Sands Bay hotel.
Take your seat at the esplanade or near the Merlion and enjoy the evening !",,,
,,Great view but got a bit boring,4,,"We did the flyer during the day our first day in Singapore. The skyline is great and you can get some pretty good pictures. The rotation takes about 30 minutes, but we were bored after about 10.

Worth a trip for the sake of a few pictures, but wouldn't do a second time. We were in a carriage with a few families and the kids seemed to enjoy it.",,,
,,Can see sunset too!,5,,Get up at 6.30pm and you might not just see the Singapore view but beautiful sunset as well. If you get the right credit card can get discount too. Enjoy the view! :),,,
,,Nice view!,4,,"Good way to get a birds eye view of the city, located opposite the marina and on the hop on hop off bus tour route it is a great stop, tickets were S$33 a person and the ride lasted about 30min.",,,
,,Enjoyable Experience,4,,I went with my in-laws and they enjoyed themselves because the ride was very slow and the night view was lovely.,,,
,,Great views of the city,4,,We came on a not so busy day and had the whole car to ourselves. The views of the city were excellent. It is too bad the price is so expensive for such a short experience.,,,
,,Good bird's eye view of the city,3,,"The Flyer has a very good location - it allows you to have a bird's eye view of the city, and the coastal areas. If you visit this place several times, you can actually document the development of the city over the years. The Flyer does not move too fast or slow, so you won't feel dizzy, or suffer from not having taken sufficient number of pictures. I personally enjoyed looking at how the skyscape has changed between the two times I went up the Flyer.

Unfortunately, the Flyer is declared bankruptcy, and is in the midst of receivership. Not sure if it will remain open in the long term.",,,
,,So so...,3,,"Was interesting to see all the views from up there, some commentary would have been helpful so we'd know what we were looking at.. Pretty slow ride and boring after the first couple of minutes",,,
,,Nice experience but not exordinary,3,,Beautiful views from up in the sky but thats about it. The ride is slow that even the kids excitement was dampened by the slow ride. The queues move relatively quickly. If you have spare time to kill then you can make an effort for this attraction otherwise you would not have missed out on much.,,,
,,Dining at the top of the world!,4,,"Dining is a very personal experience - one man's meat is always another man's poison (forgive the pun). But how personally meaningful that experience is depends on the meaning and significance you attribute to it and the careful planning that went into the arrangements - at least that's what we believe in.

1 January 2014 was certainly a memorable experience for my wife and I, as we celebrated our 7th wedding anniversary on the first day of 2014 on top of the world.

Singapore's (night) skyline was truly breath-taking, made even more perfect by the delightfully romantic ambience in the capsule, with festive lights animating the night sky both on the superstructure of the Singapore Flyer and the famous iconic landmarks all around the Marina Bay area.

We chose the New Year 2014 Specials - with wagyu beef steak and duck confit as our main courses, foie gras and delightful handcrafted desserts to end the 1-hour ride on a sweet note. The food wasn't truly exceptional (we've tasted better food elsewhere. Morton's for example would've served better steak for sure), but it was more than the food that we were paying for. The duck confit was done quite well though, bathed in a smooth brown gravy. I would have preferred more exotic greens than just broccoli. Perhaps spears of asparagus would have fit the dish better.

Of course, to thoroughly enjoy a moment like this, we would've hoped for perhaps a longer time in the capsule. Perhaps three complete rotations (which would amount to about 1.5 hours in total) would have done justice to the price we paid. An hour was just a tad too rushed.

But that said, all good things do come in tight little packages.

Would we do it again? Probably not. We believe in going for new experiences.

But do we think it was an experience worth having? You bet your every dollar it is - should try it at least once in a lifetime!

Some quick pieces of advice:

1. Book in advance to ensure availability of preferred time slots.

2. Dress for the occasion - make it special by playing dress up. Don't just wear tee shirt and berms the way Singaporeans normally do.

3. Take a video of the view while you're up there at the top. It makes for a very good trip down memory lane when you guys want something to look back on.",,,
,,Best View of Singapore,4,,"We used the hop on/off bus from our hotel The Miramar to the Singapore Flyer.
The Singapore Flyer is $33 for a single ticket.
The ride is between 30-45 mins long, going around very slowly, it is much larger than the London Eye and has plenty of room in the pods, which although are glass, are very well air conditioned, so there is no need to worry about the heat.
I went during a quiet period, so I didn't have to queue.
Don't be tempted to take camera shots on the way up, wait until you get to the very top and you will get some excellent views, without wasting pictures. Unfortunately I took photos on the way up and then the batteries died in my camera, which was a shame, as I missed out!!!
You can get a good view of the Singapore F1 pit stop area below, which is good as it is not a tourist attraction as yet, so you cannot walk around it.
There is plenty of room in the pods, so they are not claustrophobic, but you need a good head for heights.
I would recommend this as a ""must do"" for Singapore, as apart from being in a plane or helicopter it is the only way to see the skyline and how vast Singapore really is.
In the complex there are plenty of eateries, gift shops, a flight simulator and a F1 simulator.
There is no need for an umbrella, as this complex is covered.
You can also join the amphibious vehicle (Duck) tours that go into the river from here, there is a large ticket office for all Singapore experiences ie the zoo, duck tours, evening dinner in the pods etc.",,,
,,Another Singapore Must Do!,4,,"The views from this attraction are superb and the overall experience of this attraction is a must do when visiting Singapore.
It is also surrounded by all the usual shopping facilities and eating places and it reflects the tourist efficiency one associates with Singapore.
The individual pods are well ordered and the local views are just great, a must see when one visits Singapore on either a stopover or when a longer spell is spent on this wonderful island",,,
,,Good Experience,4,,One of the best attractions of Singapore. Large well maintained capsules with excellent views. Very orderly. Definitely worth trying out.,,,
,,Engineering marvel.....excellent view,4,,"we visited the Singapore Flyer in the last week of December'13. the structure is just amazing and an engineering marvel. the spores are beautifully designed structures with a 360 degree view of the city. the commentary inside is very informative.
book your tickets online so as to save time since as such the que to enter the spore itself is quite big considering the holiday season. there are packages available to select. connectivity is good if you are using public transport. it's just a 30 minute ride overall. u can combine visiting gardens by the bay since it's very nearby. just catch a taxi from flyer. hardly SGD5.
must do activity while in Singapore.",,,
,,Expensive compared to other attractions,3,,"Not that great really, I found it quite expensive compared to other attractions in Singapore especially when the experience only lasts 30 minutes. Views are good but considering the sky high buildings that you can get the same views from, I wouldn't bother.",,,
,,Great views of the city,4,,"The Singapore flyers offer great views of the city. but doesn't offer good views of Marina Sandy Bays towers, still good fun to do. getting there is relatively easy even though we used the hop on hop off bus.",,,
,,Awesome. Breath taking view,5,,"Went at night for the most fantastic view of the Singapore sky line. Purchased ticket prior to dinner then went up at dusk, got the most beautiful pictures of the city.",,,
,,Well worth it,4,,Great views from different heights and angles as the Ferris Wheel makes it 30 minute journey. I was pleasantly surprised - much better than the Marina Bay Sands skydeck,,,
,,"Incredible view, worth doing",5,,"Not cheap, but an amazing view of Singapore. Well worth doing. Easily accessible by the MRT and about a 10m walk. A great way to get a feel for Singapore.",,,
,,Great views at night!,4,,"A fun, easy tourist thing to do which offers great views of the city. There weren't any crowds when we went after dinner. It was lovely to circle round seeing the city by night and from memory takes about 30 min for a rotation.",,,
,,Nice View,3,,"This is the biggest flyer in the world! It is something you have to do in Singapore, but it is a little boring because there is nothing to do, just appreciate the view!",,,
,,"Good views, but now surpassed by those at Marina bay sands hotel",4,,"Enjoyed the flyer, but the views are fairly limited, compared to those from the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel now.",,,
,,Teenage son liked this,1,,Son went on this & loved it. There are excellent food stalls under it at reasonable cost. Super fresh squeeze juice stall too--not dear. All the Hopon/hopoff buses park here so good spot to check them out & start circular tour from there. DO NOT get the cheapest one (orange colour) as they finish too early. I was surprised when I read timetable after I had paid. Saw others in city in the evenings so I think better value as they run for longer.,,,
,,Views of Singapore,4,,This was my second visit to the flyer and it was interesting to see the changes and the place develops. Its a slow journey round and good for taking photographs. Its one of the things to do if you have time but it is a bit out of the way and you need to consider transportation.,,,
,,Amazing Afternoon Tea,5,,"This was our second trip on the Singapore Flyer, the first time was 4 years ago when we had a evening meal ""on board"", this time because we wanted to see Singapore during the day we had ""Afternoon Tea"" well worth every penny - or should I say cent - along with the waiter Wayne, we where the only other people in the capsule, it was great value for money each having two open sandwiches, one chicken, one tuna, two muffins, two more small cakes and a small desert as well as orange juice and tea/coffee. I think this worked out to be 拢25 each including flight. The waiter Wayne was very helpful pointing out various landmarks to see. I would strongley recommend this attraction",,,
,,Gorgeous views,4,,We went on the Singapore flyer on our honeymoon as my husband proposed on the London Eye and thought it would be sweet. It was a lovely trip. Well worth the money. The views are gorgeous and really take your breath away!,,,
,,Great view of Marina Bay,4,,A great view but you spend about 40 minutes or more so consider that when scheduling! You can also purchase photos taken before boarding - all 6 for 50SGD which is a good deal compared to other attractions!,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,3,,"it's my first time in singapore flyer. i came with friends. we were forbidden to ride on due to very strong winds that blow around. we waited for 30 minutes until the wind back to normal and join in the line of people. finally we ride on, this object moved very slowly until we could see the view of singapore from the top, it's really amazing..",,,
,,Panoramic,5,,Just can't believe I rode the world's tallest ferris wheel! The panoramic view of singapore... the sky.. everything! The capsule is large and for a 30min ride.. you can experience the beautiful singapore :),,,
,,Breathtaking View,4,,"Must try attraction if u visit singapore, i recommend try this at night. You can view 360 degree in the capsule of the flyer. Te breathtaking view will you get. Must try!",,,
,,"If you have to choose between the Flyer and the Skypark, go the Flyer!",4,,"An absolutely fantastic way to relax and see Singapore. The guided tour tells you where to look and when! Very similar to the Skypark at Marina Bay, but much more conducive to a group big or small",,,
,,Worth doing once,4,,"Unlike other reviewers' experience the line moved quickly and we pretty much walked right on. Numbers in each cabin were limited to sitting room so it wasn't at all crowded - maybe that changes on busier days? The view was nice and the facility clean and professional. Biggest downside is the cost - $33 for an adult is ridiculous for 20-odd minutes looking at the view. Half that would have been reasonable. A covered walkway between the entrance and the bus parking area would be sensible as we got saturated getting back to the bus during one of the sudden downpours (luckily, it was fine when we were on the flyer).",,,
,,Wonderful Views,4,,"We visited one morning, about half an hour after this attraction opened, and it was reasonably quiet. The waiting time was less than five minutes. There were only eight of us in the capsule so there was lots of space to move around and admire the city from all angles. Needless to say it is best to visit on a clear day to maximise the views. We booked on line (10% discount) and just quoted our reference number when we got there.",,,
,,Champagne ride is amazing,5,,"I did the champagne ride with my husband and a friend. The ticket cost $69 each. The ride lasts half an hour so it's one full turn on the well. You can not order this ticket from the SISTIC desk but you can order it on the Internet. We turned up at 8.45pm on a Sunday night and was on the next flight at 9pm. You get to check in at the guest service area, you also get to q jump. You receive one glass of bubbles, chocolates and strawberries. This is best done at night time to see the amazing views. I would do this again.",,,
,,Flying over Singapore,3,,"The tallest Ferris wheel in the world. sounds good and interesting. Well actually its very overpriced. The ride itself is quite good, the pods are air-conditioned with middle seating, but its a slow ride and not really very interesting for kids. You can go on a dinner ride which looked quite good. I would recommend this to the sight-seeing junkie only. There is food stalls and restaurants surrounding the wheel, all which are good, food was nice. Busy place, but didn't take long to get on the ride, takes around 1 hr to complete the ride. Most kids would be bored by the time its finished. We went at night. The lights were lovely to look at, for the first 10 mins.",,,
,,Quite Good,4,,Gives you excellent views of the city skyline as you would expect. The capsules are large and can accommodate 10-15 people in each one of them. Sadly there is no audio commentary or guide to get you more information of what you get to see from up there.,,,
,,Great view,4,,"It is near Esplanade so you can walk from the Esplanade to the Singapore Flyer.

Good to go when it is not raining so that you can see the view from up there. After viewing, do eat at the food centre located just below the Flyer.

Good!",,,
,,boring,2,,Unfortunately I felt the wheel was way too slow and not enough to see at night. I wouldn't recommend visiting the wheel at night. can't comment on day time - might be better,,,
,,Going for a spin......very slowly!,5,,"Amazing experience and well organized attraction. Although there was a queue, everything was handled very efficiently as you would expect in Singapore and it didn't take very long before we were in our capsule. Entrance fee was SGD 33 (SGD 24 for over 60s). There is also a basic family value pack available. There are various ""packages"" available which are described on the website including high tea flight or a dining flight. The views across Singapore are breathtaking and looking out towards Indonesia, it becomes apparent just how busy the shipping lanes are with an incredible number of anchored ships near to the Port of Singapore.
When we travelled, the flyer staff did not allow too many passengers in each capsule so there was plenty of photo opportunities and seats available. If in Singapore this should be a must see attraction which is easily accessible on the various hop on hop off buses or only a short walk from the nearest MRT station ( promenade station - CC4 on Circle line)
Either before or after the flyer visit, there are a number of places serving food and drinks (Singapore food trail) and the inevitable gift shops.",,,
,,Enjoy the Evening,5,,"Be on the top of the world with the world highest flyer. Also, take snaps. It is a memorable moment. The eateries are excellent and the view is awesome.",,,
,,Probably a must-do!,3,,"The 'flight' itself is pretty good, but nothing special. Certainly the 'pre-flight' stuff could easily be skipped and the 'hawker stall' at the flyer is over-priced and disappointing compared to others around town. If you have the time & the cash, I'd make the effort, but don't have your expectations too high!",,,
,,Worth the ride,4,,"This is possibly the best flyer in the world, for sure the capsules are larger than the London Eye which up to now was my top one. It is worth going after few days you have been visiting the city as you will be able to highlight the places yuo have seen.",,,
,,Must go!,5,,"The views were GREAT, and the exhibits about the Flyer before the flight were very interesting. The stores and restaurants below the Flyer are also definitely worth visiting for excellent Singaporean food.",,,
,,Birds eye view of Singapore,4,,Singapore flyer is one experience one must have while visiting singapore.Its 45 min ride with take you through the history of singapore helping you to understand singapore culture and also enjoy one of the most breathtaking views of the central district.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"As usual Singapore have got it right in the placement of their wheel. The views from the top are over the harbour, the city and the race track. There is a lot of building work being carried out around the city and the variety of old and new buildings are magnificent. There are beautiful well kept gardens below so, having done the circuit of the wheel, make sure you visit these too. Like everything else in Singapore, the wheel is well maintained and all is spotlessly clean. A joy to visit.",,,
,,Great views over the city,5,,One of the must-do things in Singapore and do it early in your day so you get a feel for that part of the city. It was a dull grey day when we flew but the views are still magnificent.,,,
,,must visit,5,,You must take time out to visit Singapore flyer. The view is amazing. We did around evening time so we get the best of both view day and and night time view from flyer,,,
,,Not something to shout about,3,,"Sadly, I would not say this is one of the highlights of Singapore... ... while the area is quite lovely and a stroll along the riverfront is beautiful, there is nothing particularly interesting about the ride. Not something I would recommend if you don't have a lot of time on your hands... ...",,,
,,Amazing,5,,I am terrified of heights and I really enjoyed this. Felt very safe and secure. Views are amazing! Would recommend this to everyone,,,
,,Breathtaking Views,5,,"The views were amazing, It took a while to go full circle so it was easy to get beautiful photos. The complex that it located in is very user friendly and has a beautiful mini rain forest with ponds and fish which is very relaxing.

It was also easily accessible by public transport.",,,
,,Arguably provides the best view in Singapore.,5,,The speed of the ride was nice and slow.Very safe ride.Great for photos. It was great to see both Malaysia and Indonesia from the flyer. Given Singapore's location a great location for the Flyer.,,,
,,Brilliant view of Singapore,5,,"We had 7 hours to kill so left the airport and took the mrt to town. Did raffles etc but the highlight was the flyer. Biggest in the world until Dubai fininsh theirs. Amazing views of the harbour, F1 racing track and the sheer size of Singapore as it goes on to the horizon.",,,
,,Expansive views,4,,"Light consumerism whilst visiting the Flier made it a better experience (I imagine at least) in that my wife and I travelled in the large cabin on our own.

The views are quite amazing offering many photo opportunities.

I was absolutely intrigued by the number of ships in the harbour - literally hundreds. Incredible. It was a leisurely half hour spin and well worth the money.",,,
,,Fun way to see great views,4,,Shared capsule with one other couple - loved the views and the flyer itself seemed very well maintained.,,,
,,Fly by night!,5,,"A visit to the Flyer at night shows you just how beautiful a city Singapore is. The skyline is gorgeous at night, with Marina Bay in front of you and the city skyline behind it's well worth seeing.",,,
,,breath taking views. prefer night time,5,,"you will get a breath-taking view through the eye of Asia. it is 45 minutes of sheer pleasure. i went ther post sunset, planned. to vview the lightings & entire panoramic view. i suggest try going around the sunset time, as it is a 45 min ride, you can start when the sun is about to set and end when its dark. this way you can take the fun of the twilight views. highly recommendable, must go. and surely try ""Popeyes"" fried chicken, located just outside the Flyer complex. it is a must try to satisfy the taste bud, after giving orgasm to your eyes.

cheers..!!",,,
,,Good but pricey,3,,The singapore flyer is good and the views from the top are very good. But spending 33$ for a about a 20 mins ride was not well worth it. The price should have been around 15 bucks,,,
,,Best view of Singapore,5,,"This is probably a must-visit location in Singapore. Located near Marina Bay, it is easy access from downtown. Arrive early to beat the crowd. I do not know any place else in the country that offer excellent views of Singapore. Enjoy the 360 view of the city. It took us at least half hour to go around. From here, you can eat at Singapore Food trail and enjoy river boat cruise right next door!",,,
,,Amazing View of Singapore,5,,"Ever wanted to see what birds see? Well with the Singapore flyer you can. This ride is kinda expensive, but once you get to the top, you will forget about the price, and you will be truly mesmerized. It goes slowly, perfect for taking photos. You can see the singapore F1 track. Definitely worth it! Note: queues can be pretty long on peak seasons",,,
,,Nice ride,5,,"It was a nice ride at dusk to catch the sun going down and birds eye view of the city, Singapore.

The ride was smooth and gentle. Takes a while from start to finish.

There are some shops in the complex but I did not visit them.

It is good for those wanting to see part of the country in a hurry and take some good pictures",,,
,,Wonderful Views,5,,"The Flyer was a great afternoon attraction. We went on the Flyer with our two young children, we all had a great time and the views were amazing! I would really recommend a visit to the SIngapore Flyer.
Even with a 6 year old and a 1 year old we were able to keep them entertained and amused throughout the trip around!",,,
,,Not,5,,"really my kind of thing, but I am so glad I went on it the views are amazing. The whole thing is so well organised & very reasonably priced",,,
,,Great view and highly recommended,4,,"I didn't think a ferris wheel on steroids would interest me, but when in Rome...

So I can report that I did enjoy the trip up and down on the Singapore Flyer. Lots of good photos just as the sun was beginning to set.

It does take a while (I think 40 odd minutes to go around) so be mindful if you have restless kids (like the two families in my cabin).

You also may not like it if you're afriad of heights. Otherwise, I suggest you check it out, especially if it's one of the only times you'll do something like this.

If you are using public transport, it can be awkward to get to. A bit of a walk and not well signed exactly where to go (but you should get the general direction).",,,
,,In a spin..,5,,A great way to see SIngapore from a different perspective. We arrived early so no queues. Good value for money. I can imagine it would be a different experience if you had to queue for any length of time in hotter weather. An enjoyable attraction.,,,
,,Not that great value!,3,,"The experience is of average but the fee is rather too high for the 'adventure' we had! They should have provide a little more excitement like maybe include a snack meal, etc.",,,
,,"Great views, good orientation when you arrive",4,,"Each capsule is air conditioned and can hold about 28 people, it was very quiet on the day we went as a party of 3, we shared the capsule with a family of 4 so we had plenty of space. If it was busy then your views might be restricted. Access was easy. I rate it as expensive, as I thought many of the attractions in Singapore, although most of the public ones such as parks and botanical gardens were free. Very clean, no garbage anywhere. The flyer is a good place to start in Singapore, by showing you an overview of the city.",,,
,,Great Views,5,,This is a 30 minute ride. Visit at night to get a great view of the city. There is an option to pre book a dinner on your ride which is really great thing to do.,,,
,,Must do,5,,"Very good experience, I got the whole car to myself, excellent views of Singapore. $33 is not cheap, but worth the money. Would be good to do it at night also but I didn't have the time.
the only negative thing would be that many windows had greasy smudges from previous assengers, would be nice if they could take the time to give the place a wipe down between travellers.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Visited in early in November in middle of afternoon, no queues so walked on straightaway and had pod all to ourselves. Clear day and gave us a great view, price ok and got discount through showing our boarding pass from Singapore Airlines.",,,
,,It is good if you want a complete view of Singapore..!!,4,,"The view is awesome. Each of the 28 air-conditioned capsules is capable of holding 28 passengers, and a complete rotation of the wheel takes about 30 minutes. Best time to go is half an hour before sunset...That way you get to see Singapore both in natural lights and later lights on in all the huge towers..Trust me the view is divine. like thousands and thousands of stars sparkling at night.

I would have liked the place to a great degree had i not visited the Marina Bay Sands sun-deck at the 57th floor or not taken the ropeway to Sentosa island.. Both of them also give similar views..",,,
,,Worth Checking Out,4,,"We went here with a guide who explained the backstory to the place. Definitely worth visiting, the overall ambiance of this place is moving.",,,
,,Great night views,5,,"Went to the Singapore Flyer at night, half an hour goes very fast but it is the right length of time to take great pictures. Recommend checking the time the Gardens at the Bay show times and the laser lights at Marina Bay Sands so you can watch while in the flyer.",,,
,,Excellent experience.,4,,"A little bit pricey. I paid around $30 sing $. It takes around 30min. If you are going to the roof top bar on 1raffles place, the singapore flyer is not necessary, We have a better view from 1raffles place.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,Singapore Flyer... must visit. The view is so good. Mainly in the night time. Its just walk-able distance from Marina bay and other attractions. Have many restaurants too but bit costly.,,,
,,A must,5,,"Fantastic sights over Singapore - best time is late afternoon, early evening as the sun is setting. Very good views of the Marina Bay Sands and Sentosa Island",,,
,,Fantastic views,4,,"Went to the flyer just after dusk,as we thought a nightime view would be a better experience. We were slightly delayed due to the weather conditions.We were not disappointed.We had fantastic views of the skyline and took plenty of photographs.There were about 10 people in our capsule so we had plenty of room to move about. Well worth the trip!",,,
,,a good ride,5,,great views of the area and a nice cocktail if you opt for the sling. would recommend this just for the experience. a good selection of restaurants below and easily accessible.,,,
,,Nice views but not as good as the London eye,2,,"The flyer was fine, the views were great but there was no additional information to tell you what you're looking at. Could have been a lot better",,,
,,Excellent,5,,Must Visit. The view is just awesome. You cannot afford to miss it. After all generally you don't visit the same country more than once.,,,
,,Great,4,,"Family loved it , great view , easy to locate via M R T , staff efficient and friendly , surrounding activities conveniently located . A bit on expensive side !",,,
,,Try to Fly,4,,Unusual and fairly economical way of viewing Singapore from the air. The wheel takes you on an enjoyable and constantly changing view out over Singapore,,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,"Went mid morning so was not very busy, just myself and 2 others in the one capsule so plenty of space. Was a lovely clear day and the views were spectacular.",,,
,,Must do!!,5,,We took the round at night time and we have enjoyed it very much. Great work and master technology but mostly the Singapore night view is amazing. You must do it at least once,,,
,,Nice overview of singapore,4,,"We visit any flyer- like activity in cities which have them. The singapore flyer gives a nice overview of the city but is certainly no London Eye for impact but is still worth visiting. We were here in the quieter time of the year so had no queues to deal with. As it was monsoon, it was a little cloudy but we were still able to get a good view.",,,
,,good choicefor family and children,5,,"flyer visit is best for me in singapore----jouney in flyer is about 30 miniuts----in each capsule max-20 to 30paxx capacity--very slow and safe also for all age people----we can see allsingapore,malasiya and indonesia from top of flyer.--fee willbe 32 singapore doller per person.itsnice expirence over all---",,,
,,Great view,5,,The Singapore Flyer have great views of the city. It was unfortunate for us that it started pouring just after we got on and continued for the rest of the afternoon. It moved slowly enough that our daughter who is scared of heights wasn't afraid. Only negative was that the family ticket was for 2 adults and 1 child. Each additional child had to be paid for at full child price.,,,
,,Breathtaking view of the City - highly recommended at night,5,,"My partner and I climbed aboard our capsule accompanied by another 10 passengers on 9 December 2013. I must admit we were extremely lucky as it was an exceptionally clear night. The views were spectacular from the brightly lit towers of the Financial District, the harbour and the F1 start/finish straight y name but a few. An experience we will never forget. Make sure you take a good quality camera to capture the memorable views - don't rely on the souvenir shop as it does not sell any postcards/pictures which truly reflect the sights you have just enjoyed. Price in December 2013, S$33 per adult - well worth it.",,,
,,Birds eye view!,5,,"Beautiful view! Different beautiful view at every angle, the skyscrapping builinding in Singapore is awesome. The Singapore flyer location is perfect, view of nature, view of sea, and man made buildings. It is more expensive if you buy ticket at entrance, we bought from Drop Inn and we saved good amount. i will recommend to go on the Singapore flyer because it is fantastic!",,,
,,Scenic city view,5,,100% city view of Singapore. beautiful skyline and lights of singapore especially in evening. Flyer is alittle expensive but worth the trip if you have the time. The ride would take roughly an hour.,,,
,,Go 30min before sunset,3,,"The round takes 30 minutes, if you go there 30 min before sunset you should be able to have the most beautiful light on the city when you鈥檙e on top. It was something like $33, plenty money. Personally I enjoyed the free view from Marina Bay Sands much more than this flyer.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Visited 9thDec,excellent value for money and seniors price.Great views ,no queues.Very safe attraction with shopping ,Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Merlion not too far away.
Travel by MRT and pay for single journeys all day ticket is $20 from 5am till 11pm,not 24 hours.
Very clean city with many attractions.",,,
,,Great Views of Singapore,4,,"As one would expect, the views from the Flyer are excellent. The main views take in the city, Marina Bay Sands, the futeristic gardens and chinatown/Clarkes Quay. Well worth the money. There were no queues and we walked straight on. If romantic (and prepared to spend the money), you can also have dinner on the Flyer in one of the special pods.",,,
,,Great View,4,,The height to enjoy the view is just nice!! It would be better if the speed is slightly slower so that we can take even more pic.,,,
,,Good value,4,,30 minutes at a cost of approx 拢33 Singapore dollars if I remember rightly. Superb views. Went on a Wednesday no Q at all and had a section to ourselves. Good attraction.,,,
,,up!,4,,"thus is a 30 min ride, better to visit during the night. breath taking view... scary at first but when inside, feels safe :)",,,
,,Singpore Flyer,5,,It is almost similar to London Eye in London. But a great time to spend in leisure from where you can see the entire Singapore.,,,
,,Unforgettable experience,5,,"Made Singapore Flyer as our first target during our visit. It was worth it! We arrived at the Flyer soon after 10 AM and could just walk into the cable car, which we shared only with another couple. Of course we missed the colours of the evening but on the other hand, we did not need to wait.

Sceneries were just unforgettable, you could see how green Singapore is and how wild architecture they have. Due to 1500 plus already added pictures, I shall not add my own ones.

Even my wife, who is not really mad about cable cars or similar things, felt, that this was not a bad ride at all.",,,
,,"Fantastic views, not for the faint-hearted",3,,"Singapore will lie at your feet, in all it's generally over-priced glory, on the Singapore Flyer.

We booked online and combined it with the Duck Tour, which saved us some $$. The Flyer would've have benefited with a skyline map in each gondola so visitors would know what they are looking at. Glad we did the Duck Tour before so we recognized some of the landmarks. Visit the bathroom before you hop on and bring your own water and snacks. If you can, try and time your ride for around sunset so you get some amazing aerial shots of the Garden by the Bay. Leave behind anyone without a head for heights!",,,
,,waste of time,2,,"I didn't like the flyer 1 bit, it's a waste of time. You get a better view from top on sands and the flyer is good as a backdrop if you look at it from other locations around. :-)",,,
,,Great Sightseeing Place,4,,"We loved the Singapore Flyer. We ate twice at the Hawker Centre there since our Tour East tours started from this location. The flyer itself is apparently in receivership. But the trip around in 30min is still interesting and provides the opportunity for some great sightseeing. The views were spectacular. The music in the flyer cars is very easy listening and provides some sort of atmosphere to the experience.
We also went to the Kenko Fish Spa in the Singapore Flyer which was very cool as the little fishes eat away at your feet's dead skin. Quite the experience!",,,
,,Lovely view like all wheels/flyers/eyes...,3,,"The view from the Flyer is certainly spectacular on a clear day and a nice perspective on Singapore.

However that is really it - it is the obligatory ""go up the highest attraction"" in a city you are visiting. If you pay to go up to the Skypark at Marina Bay Sands there is really no need to also pay for this experience.

We went early in the morning on the first fine day we had in Singapore and had a carriage to ourselves. At 30 mins with no included audio commentary it did get a bit boring once you had reached the apex. On a busy/crowded day I imagine it would be hideous as there was clearly a LOT of queuing space available (we just walked straight on).

Parents of young children also note strollers/prams are NOT permitted and you have to give them up at the very start, so in addition to the flight time you could end up having to hold your baby for quite some time.",,,
,,Great views of a beautiful enchanting city,5,,"Similar to the giant wheel in London, the Flyer affords a fantastic overview of the city and harbour.",,,
,,Most Amazing,5,,Every person has to visit once the SINGPORE FLYER. Its an really Good EXPERIENCE .... one can never forget it. The view from the top is the most best experience.,,,
,,The bat鈥檚 eye view that I had,4,,"It was a trip being part of a conference package (normal rate ~SGD33) but it was worth the stay since agreeing to the 45-minute ride meant I would be back in Johor after 11 pm. Though we were told that a day ride would have been better, I disagree, at least for that moment when I looked at the multi-colored lights of the Singapore city skyline in the comfort of the flyer cabin. It was a surprisingly stable cabin since the flyer鈥檚 speed was very slow, slow enough for one to appreciate the 360 degree view including the F1 tracks and take memorable photos at any corner of your choice. There are souvenir stores as you exit the cabin at the end of your trip. The photo that was taken prior to boarding is available too if you are interested - just like any other tower rides in the world, free picture taken but costs for each copy. If you have a day only in Singapore, make this a main itinerary.",,,
,,Enjoyable Ride,4,,I enjoyed my ride on the flyer. Good view of Singapore from the top. The ride takes 30 minutes so it's not fast at all and you don't feel the movement. The cars are air conditioned and have plenty of space to walk around in. I think one time is enough though.,,,
,,Amazing view of Singapore,4,,"The Singapore flyer is like a huge giant wheel that contains many coaches (similar to a tiny rail coach). Each coach carries 10-20 people. While the flyer rotates, one can see the breath taking views of the city of Singapore.",,,
,,up up and away,5,,"What a wonderful experience this was. One did feel like one was up in the sky like a bird.
The day we went it was a nice clear and sunny day which made going up on the Flyer great for those high up photos of Singapore. We were fortunate to have part of a small tour group and their leader in our capsule so we had a free commentary which was a nice bonus. I was also surprised by security that we had to go through which was fast and of no bother.
Overall, highly recommended.",,,
,,Worth it,4,,A little expensive but worth it. Great views and the 30 minute trip was over in no time. No queues and fortunately we had a fine day but it might not be as good if it was raining.,,,
,,Far reaching views,5,,What a fantastic way to see the city. It was a nice clear day and the Flyer was a perfect way to see for miles in all directions. The 30 minute rotation was just right. Thoroughly recommended.,,,
,,"Views, views views!",5,,"I guess as with all other wheels of this sort, it's just one of those things you have to do as a tourist. We took the MRT there, and found it easily enough - it is kind of hard to miss! The views are great, and I am not a great fan of heights, but was actually OK with this, felt quite safe.",,,
,,Lovely Ride,5,,We went just around dusk for good lighting to take photos. There were no lines and the ride was very comfortable. Even my wife who is afraid of heights enjoyed herself in the spacious and solid feeling capsule. Oh also I just turned 60 and got my very first senior discout ever.,,,
,,Must Visit Attraction in Singapore,5,,"It is a must visit attaction in Singapore. If you want to thrill your life partner, you can book a Flyer Capsule for a romantic dinner. Moreover you can celebrate birthday's as well .... Don't forget its all for Singapore Dollars .. :)",,,
,,Bestest ride above Singapore,5,,I have taken this joyride twice so far and looking forward to board again if opportunity arise. Both rides were bind blowing as to see Signapore above the ground level so beautifully located that makes me feel true high and top of world!!!,,,
,,Good Experience,4,,"My first experience in a Big flyer. It was very thrilling right from start to end. The view from the flyer was amazing.
Could see almost half of singapore from the topmost point of the flyer. I just went for sightseeing but the flyer also has the facility to dine. We can celebrate any special occasion in the flyer.",,,
,,Oh So High,5,,"For one who really does not like heights I was quite reluctant to go on the Singapore Flyer, but as we were given the tickets from our travel agent and other members of the family were there, I agreed to do it. I was so amazed that I actually enjoyed it very much. The views are stunning, and the wheel turns so slowly you don't even feel it moving. Many photos were taken of Singapore from inside the pod, I loved It !!!!!",,,
,,Very cool view,4,,"I went to the flyer and thoroughly enjoyed it. Go in the morning, soon after it opens to avoid the crowds. I got a whole car all to myself and loved it. It was a small fee for the long ride. Make sure you take a good camera and get as many shots as you can!",,,
,,A definate if you visit Singapore,5,,"If you want to see Singapore and it's Islands from a different prospective - this is a must. The ride lasts approximately 30 minutes. Great views are to be had across the city, Marina Bay, Botanical Gardens and beyond to Singapores distant islands.",,,
,,"A ""must see""",5,,"We visited on a pretty clear day and enjoyed wonderful views of Marina Bay, the city and surrounding areas. Nice to have a bird's eye view of the Gardens by the Bay and to be at 'eye level' with the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

The base of the Flyer has shops providing food and a place where you can pay for fish to clean your feet. Outside you can go on a 'Duck' ride.

Would be happy to go back one day and do the Flyer at night ;)",,,
,,A must do in Singapore,4,,"We chose to do this at night and weren't dissappointed, great views and the ride was long enough that you saw everything but didn't get bored.

We went at about 9 pm there were no queues so basically went straight on. Would recommend late or early understand there are queues during middle of day.",,,
,,Overrated,4,,"If you already had a good view of the city from a rooftop or somewhere high, you won`t see anything new. We went there on our last night and if it wasn`t the Champagne Cabin I would be disappointed.",,,
,,Go at night..,4,,"If you go to Singapore, this is one of the best attraction in the country. You should go at night in a clear weather. It goes really high that you may see most of Singapore. Good experience..",,,
,,Excellent views,5,,We did this at the same time as the Friday night practice for the 2013 F1 Grand Prix. Awesome views of the city. My personal opinion is that it's probably better at night.,,,
,,Don't miss the Flyer,4,,"Staff were very courteous, and helpful. We quite enjoyed the fact that the Flyer went round several times and we really felt we'd gotten our money's worth. We'd not been in the city for 6 years, and really liked the way it has continued to grow.",,,
,,Awesome experience on the Giant Ferries Wheel,5,,Indulge in the lovely city sights atop Singapore's giant observation wheel. Its a one-of-a-kind experience. The 30-min ride would enable you to get a spectacular view of the Marina Bay. The night lights is lovely too!,,,
,,Like the London eye-only bigger,4,,It's a got-to-do thing in Singapore and gives you an amazing view over the area and it looks great at night.,,,
,,If only it was in Hong Kong,3,,The wheel is fun but on an ordinary day there was not much to see in the Singapore sky line. Best to go in the evening around 8 or 9pm when there is the light show in Marina Bay.,,,
,,awesome experience,5,,"it's been an outstanding and one of the best experience i ever had in my life, watching the streets and the city from above about 200 ft. it looks wonderful site, even when the city's sparkling light and the moving vehicles in the street in the frequent manner and the endless amazement from the top view of the flyer is like a worthwhile visit to the giant wheel which is seen to be non moving from the far distance but when we entered it's feels moving only when the height is slowly slowly increased from the ground level instead the city is looks more glowing when we saw it from the top view and the heart compassionate with the site of the city.
even when we reach there their is announcement that the flight get cancelled because of some weather but with in span of minutes these people made the attraction ready to move and as we are eagerly waiting for our turn, finally we reach there, we saw their is perfect queue, with in span of seconds they accommodate peoples in the flyer, this all management of the attractions seems to worth watching, i had enjoyed a lot in this tour and if i get this opportunity again in future then surely i visit the same attractions again.......",,,
,,WHY IS IT CALLED FLYER ????,3,,"THE Singapore flyer is the worlds largest observation wheel, this is true, but the location is all wrong. Had it been more on marina bay it would have much more to offer. Thankfully the flyer only moves slowly. The price was a little steep. Interesting fact; the mini forest under the base of the wheel is watered from the air condition run off from each capsule..",,,
,,Over rated,2,,"For the price you pay you get roughly 30.mins in the cabin, not worth it. better ways to see from top",,,
,,An enchanting view!,4,,This is the 2nd time I have tried the flyer. The day one comes with audio headset which introduces the vicinity but the night ride didn't provide the headset. 30 min whisked by and before long we are back on the ground again. The night sight is stunning too! Worth a try at least!,,,
,,Timepass Attraction !!!,3,,"I had been on London Eye so it wasn't a novelty for me but my other family members enjoyed it very much. We had to go as it was included in our unlimited iventurecard attractions. There was no queue, no crowd though we went on a Sunday. Views are panoramic, provides many photo opportunities. They close it down when it rains. Nearest MRT is promenade. There is a bus stand just under the bridge.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,3,,"It is the world's largest observation wheel standing at 165 metres (about 42 storey of a building). If you are not afraid of height, enjoy Singapore's magnificant cityscape from the cabin. As the wheel turns, you will have a vision of 360 degrees views of icnoic and historical landmarks of Singapore; like Marina Bay, Singapore River, Raffles Place, Merlion Park, Empress Place and the Padang.
After the ride, you could feast at the nearby restaurants. They offered signature dishes such as chilli crabs, butter crabs, cereal prawns and drunken prawns.The food street there serves a wide selection of hawker food. A must try if you are a visitor in Singapore.",,,
,,Amazing views of Singapore,4,,We rode at nighttime and the views of the city were spectacular. You can also book dinner and wine tour on the flyer.,,,
,,Great views of Singapore!,5,,We chose to experience this with the special private carriage with cocktails at sunset - this is the way to go! The views from there area spectacular!,,,
,,Sparkling island at night,4,,"An ideal place to have an overview of magical night scenery in this city. On the top - the best position, remember to prepare your camera for perfect panorama photo. The feeling of being a high cabin is also cool.",,,
,,Ride the Icon,4,,"It a great way to get one's bearings in Singapore. It's a very efficient process for loading even when it's crowded. The ride is great, with plenty to time to sight see. While it's a little on the expensive side, they don't overload the cars, so there is lots of room to move around and take photos.",,,
,,Revolutionary Dining with a View,4,,"I am not kidding. You can reserve a dining capsule for two revolutions of the flyer. It is costly, but worth it for a special date, anniversary, or birthday. The capsules are roomy and if you have a large group, it can hold 28 persons. This is not for people afraid of heights or claustrophobic.
We found it exciting and a different experience than the usual tourist attractions. Bring binoculars and a camera. There is a table inside so you can set your camera on it to take photos of your group. I think the 55 minute timing of the revolution is perfect for the non-dining experience.
You really do not want it to be like a ferris wheel; it is an observation wheel. Timing it for early evening gives you a chance to take photos of sunlit scenes and then lighted panoramas.",,,
,,Good view of Singapore,3,,We went at night. The long queue took more time than the time we were in the flyer. Singapore skyline is good but not great. London eye is way better. We booked this attraction through Expedia (in AUD) and got a discount.,,,
,,Magnificent Singapore City View,4,,"It is a great place to view the Singapore Skyline in the cabin. The best time is to take the cabin at 645PM to 700PM. It allowed you to see Singapore both in the Day & Night. But it may be difficult to take photo as they are many tour groups coming to the flyer at the peak hours.
Try to board the cabin when they are less passengers, it will allow you to be able to take photos at any corner of the cabin. It take 30 minutes for the cabin to made a full round. You will be able to view the magnificent city towers that rises above the Singapore skyline. You can also see the Marina Barrage and the sea south of this area.
There are also local hawker dishes for you to try out the local delights. Fast Food and Restaurants are also available . Visit the souvenir shops for the little gifts for your friends and relatives.",,,
,,could feel yourself physically age going around it,2,,"Can get the same view from the top of MBS and it doesn't take an hour and you can get something to drink (go to ku de ta - don't pay the admission). The Singapore skyline is nice, but not for that long.",,,
,,As expected,3,,"It is very much like a giant Ferris wheel with cabins that go round in 30minutes. It is quite okay and it grants you great views of Singapore, many photo-taking opportunities and you can take your time to enjoy the cityscape. But that said, it can be quite boring after a while, especially if it's a rainy day or cloudy.",,,
,,Flying High,4,,"This is a great way to see Singapore and get some great photos of the city. We booked for the high tea whilst riding and had a cabin all to ourselves. This was the best way to ride as we were able to wander around the cabin freely without being in anyone else's way. The garden at the base of the flyer is lovely and the whole area is geared towards having a good day out. The high tea was disappointing, and not very good value but that aside, the Singapore Flyer is worth going on for the views and the thrill of ""flying"" so high.",,,
,,One time experience is enough,2,,Nothing great. Only try once is enough. The fare is too high for a 30mins ride. And pls visit the washroom before boarding the flyer cabin,,,
,,Wheeling Up In SIN,3,,"Once, the Singapore Flyer had no worth views ... only mud-caked construction activity whilst the Marina Bay Sands complex was sprouting from reclaimed land. Now, there is the Marina Bay Sands complex, As is the case with Sentosa, the marina landscape is man made.

Still the surrounding sea makes for a good panorama.

The half-hour ride in the capsule that can take 28 people is a roulette spin. If you get thrown in with the wrong bunch of people, you will somewhat tremble in doom.

If you fail to get a seat, people who rushed to get a seat will still reserve their seat when they stand or walk around to take pics. Then you have the lovebirds that cling to a spot for the entire ride, cooing at each other, even though they KNOW you want their spot for 10 seconds to snap the best feature of the ride.

If you are stuck with a noisy or smelly crowd, you might as well be in the Temple of Doom.

The Singapore Flyer management should look into this aspect of the ride.

That said, if you can civilly coax barbarians within to civilize up for a second, you are really wheeling up in SIN. One important tip. Anticipate your capsule reaching the highest point. This is when you want to get your photo snapped.... there are no capsules rotating the other end to feature in your pic.

Oh... you might want to decide on a day or evening ride... or both. However you will have it, Enjoy The Spin!",,,
,,Not worth the money spent,3,,"If you just want to view Singapore's skyline from up above, Marina bay sands offers a better view from higher elevation for cheaper price. You also get obstruction free view as a bonus and can spend as much time as you want.

Singapore flyer is like night safari, something unique to Singapore. Chances are, when you visit Singapore, your friends and relatives back home will ask you flyer experience. If you tell them you skipped it, you'll get a bewildered stare followed by a sorry look. If you are someone who loves to brag or attract attention, go for it. Otherwise spend that money on something more worthwhile.

You won't even feel the flyer moving, so don't expect roller coaster style adventure.",,,
,,High above Singapore,5,,"We had a great time on the Singapore Flyer. If you can go early. We were there at opening time and so were alone in a cabin and had the opportunity to enjoy it and take pictures videos without being disturbed by others. The view is perfect, cabins are convenient. It goes round in about 30 minutes. Take your time to enjoy when in Singapore. Great opportunity to take fascinating pictures.",,,
,,Ok but not a must,2,,It's quite expensive and fairly boring. You can see over the gardens by the bay but it's better to visit them. There'll bull ding near by block the city views. It's better to go to the top if the marina bay sands for a view,,,
,,Its OK,3,,Its an OK ride but if you do it after you've been up the MBS viewing platform its a bit of a let down.,,,
,,The lowest valued attraction in Singapore,1,,"You pay too much stand in a capsule that inches slowly for one cycle which gives you an elevated view of a skyline that is better observed along the Singapore River or the Esplanade. You take photos for about 5 mins, then turn to your friends or relatives and find things to talk about. Boring, overpriced and not value-for-money.",,,
,,Pricey for one round,3,,Its a bit boring and keep stopping. Tried twice and did not enjoy the ride. I think dinner on the flyer at night will be the best time to go,,,
,,Waste of money,3,,Not much to see and quite a waste of money to take the Singapore Flyer. Would recommend to have dinner at Marina Bay Sands and see the view from there.,,,
,,As you would expect - great views.,4,,"If the name doesn't explain it, this is like the London Eye, a big wheel with cabins.

We went early evening, and walked straight on, no queues. A little bit later would have caught the lights coming on across the city, but the last SIA bus leaves here at 7.30.

Hang on to your tickets, quite a few restaurants and bars as you get off offer discount if you show your Flyer ticket.

We watched the city lights switch on from a bar at the base, a sight well worth seeing.

This trip was included free on our Singapore Stopover package.",,,
,,A Big Dissapointment,2,,"This was the second time I visited the flyer. The last time I had visited in 2009 I had a fantastic experience and had in fact liked this one over the experience in London. This trip was however a complete let down. There was no audio commentary on the various sites visible. This made 30 minute ride, just like any other visit to the top of a sky scraper, with no one giving you a bit of history, various things of interest or for that matter just a better understanding of the Singapore layout. There were two LCD screens, just playing adverts... I would not recommend people spending SGD 33/- for such an experience.",,,
,,Sparking Singapore,4,,"A highlight for Singapore night experience. You will see the great view of Marina Bay Sands and can't help admiring the marvelous scene. A bit pricey but 45 mins in the flyer trip is worth the value. You should go in about 7-8 pm. Everything is perfect in the night. Take good pictures and enjoy the view.
High recommended for tourist!",,,
,,Good experience for one time,4,,"45 mins one round flyer trip to see outstanding view of Singapore.
Perfact speed, not too slow, not too fast.
But my view, should be done only once that also in evening.
So you can enjoy sunset and night and bright Singapore.

Cons: Little overprices. Equally great view could be captured from Marina Bay Sands observation deck in more relaxed manner.",,,
,,Best to do at Night,3,,"Went on flyer as part of package around Singapore, had to do during daytime, was OK but would be better at night. Marina Bay light show is 8pm nightly so that would be a good time to be on flyer and get some great photos.",,,
,,flyer,4,,"great views of the city, was quite day after GP racing, and a difficult to get taxi cause of traffic restrictions , normally it would be easy",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"At SGD$33 per adult ticket, this was good value. The pod provides great views of Singapore (Marina Bay/Sands) - so good photo opportunities. If I had more time, I would have taken a combo ticket including the duck tour and flyer as this would have worked out much better value.
The Singapore flyer also has some shops including a fish foot massage outlet. At SGD$30 for 30 minutes, you enjoy putting your feet into a tank of fish that nibble all the dead skin away - sets you up nicely for a walk around Singapore.",,,
,,Fly 42 storeys above Singapore,4,,"Very good 'flight' in large pods above Singapore with wonderful views of the Marina Bay area and beyond.

The trip lasts about 30mins and is well worth the S$33 price tag. No need to book queues are short.

Afterwards walk back to Marina Bay Sands across the helix bridge - another great landmark.",,,
,,As advertised,4,,Its a giant ferris wheel next to Marina bay. The views are great over the city and the bay. Price isnt bad but could be less. Happy we went.,,,
,,Room with a view,5,,Thia is a london eye style experience and travels slowly round giving you a lovely view of the city. We went on the flyer during the early evening which was a great time to see things in all their glory.,,,
,,Ok but in the wrong location,3,,"With it being on the edge of the city the views are ok but not amazing.
33 dollars is ok but not outstanding vfm.
For better views marina bay sands observation deck 20 dollars and your a lot higher and much better view of the same things.
If this wheel was on boat quay it would be better but to far out of the way.",,,
,,flying high over Singapore,5,,"The Flyer gives you some good views over the CBD, and the southern end of the city plus the harbour and river mouth area down to the barricade. Well worth it",,,
,,Loved it!,5,,"Quite expensive, but worth the money. It gives you a real overview of the city, and the island, and it is the biggest in the world!",,,
,,"Up, Up and Away!!",4,,"2MovingTheChi.com visited Singapore in October 2013. Being in the downtown area several times, we debated if riding the Singapore Flyer was worth the time. The individual cost to ride the Flyer is 33 SGD (about $25 USD) which buys you a 30 minute 鈥渟pin鈥?on the Flyer. After a bit of debate, we decided, 鈥淲hat the heck. We have to add riding the Flyer to our list of things we have experienced.鈥?
The Flyer is a continuously moving Ferris Wheel with 28 individual cylindrical cabins for people to ride. Each cabin can hold about 28 people. The Flyer circles to a height of 165 meters and takes 30 minutes to complete one revolution. The day we took the ride, there was only a total of 5 people in our cabin, so we had the freedom to stand up and look all around. We were also lucky. It was our last day in Singapore, the and a thunderstorm rolled in right after we got on. After we exited the ride, the Flyer was closed because of the storm. Nearly missed it.

The views from the Flyer are breathtaking. The slow steady movement is smooth and comfortable. The bench seats are in the middle of the Flyer, enough for about 12 people to comfortably sit. As a side note, you can get the same breathtaking views at the SkyPark atop the Marina Bay Sands hotel for less money and no time restriction.

The Singapore Flyer also offers an evening one hour, four course dinner for those that might me interested. We were not.

If you are visiting Singapore, check out the Flyer.",,,
,,Worth the Money!,5,,"Pros:
-great 360 degree view of Singapore
-kid/family friendly
-very comfortable-- air-conditioned, good-sized units.
-enjoyable even for those who has acrophobia (such as me).
-reasonably priced.
- one may say that this offers a better view than the top of the Marina Sands hotel

Cons:
-NONE!",,,
,,High in the sky!,5,,"We made a night of it - first we went to the Marina Bay Sands Light Show, then we walked across the Helix Bridge to the Singapore Flyer. There were the 4 of us and another family of three in our capsule - I was really pleased that they didn't pack us in (each capsule can hold 20 people). Great views at night! Bought my tickets online before we left for our holiday and got 10% off.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Singapore Flyer should be a must for anyone visiting Singapore
Best photo to be taken while you are on board
It travels very slow about 45mins to go around so plenty of time to move around to get a photo of every angle.
I guess its the same as the London one",,,
,,Top of the world!,5,,Thanks for the wonderful experience of literally bringing me on top of the world! It's best to ride before sunset or night time to see the awesome skyline of Singapore.,,,
,,Nice Ride but too Pricey,3,,It is one of the icons in the City. We enjoyed it but I think they have to reconsider the price to attract more tourists. Its a 33 dollar ride for 30 mins. The view was really spectacular at the highest point. I wouldn't consider coming back if they still have the same price otherwise if they have promo rate I would take advantage of it. We went there during night time. It would be best to go there before sunset so you can have the view of both day and night time.,,,
,,50th birthday great,5,,Brilliant - views are spectacular must do see all of Singapore and part of Malaysia. Great view of Marina bay Sands - also great view of the Fullerton,,,
,,Up to the Sky,4,,"I went to Singapore in May 2013. One of my activities was experiencing Singapore Flyer.

A capsule can contain 20 people. If you need private, you can also ask for assistance. The price will be more expensive than normal.

I went there in the morning. When you reach at top, you will see the whole of Singapore City.

It was great, but my suggestion is trying at night because you can see the countless lights. Enjoy",,,
,,Fly me to the moon! Let me play amongst the stars!,5,,"Jill and I used the SIA Hop-On bus to go to the Flyer and it was perfect!

We also fly on Singapore Airlines so we received a 20% discount on our prices.

All I can say is DO NOT MISS THIS ATTRACTION! It was amazingly fun, exciting and the views, especially as the sun set, were amazing.

We met another couple, that was having their honeymoon, in our capsule and bloke from Australia. We were all amazed by the views and had a great time talking, taking pictures and hanging out.",,,
,,Worth a night time trip,4,,"Was told to go around dusk and watch the sunset but as it was overcast just did the trip a little later. Was great to see Singapore at night, its a liitle pricey but you can save a few dollars if you buy your ticket in your hostel.",,,
,,Views are spectacular,4,,"Went on the flyer at night time.. The view from above is absolutely spectacular!! Singapore is a beautiful city amd they deffinately put on a show at night with the lights around the buildings.
The flyer is in a great position and moves at a great speed (you bearly even notice that it's moving).
If you have the time, do it!",,,
,,exciting feeling,4,,"We visited october in flyer, no queues at all, it was weekday afternoon. If you visit at Marina bay sands SkyPark, views are even better!",,,
,,Best view of the city.,5,,Returning to Singapore and one of the must do that I forgot to do in Singapore the previous time was to see the view of the city. On the flyer you get 30minutes panoramic view of the city. I would highly recommend. I managed to get a discount at the hostel I was staying which made this really worth it.,,,
,,A great way to see Singapore from on high,4,,"I am not a big fan of the London Eye, but the Flyer is different and gives you an incredible view of Singapore and its surroundings. Definitely worth a visit.",,,
,,Perfect!,5,,The Flyer was perfect. The view was amazing! We could see every single attraction of Singapore from up there!,,,
,,Must do,5,,"This is a must do when in Singapore. We used the Hop on, Hop off bus to get there and then spent a good hour in the area. The view is amazing we could look down on where the Grand Prix track was for last months race. The carriage we were in had about 10 other people and wasn't crowded at all, everyone got time at all the windows for photography and there are seats in the centre if you need to sit. Air conditioned. Easy to get on and off. Get someone to take your photo rather than buy the one they take before you get on and then add a fake background to.",,,
,,Overpriced and overrated!,3,,This ain't a romantic type attraction and the view isn't that good until you're right at the top. It's taking too long for that and after you're at the top it's taking really long to go down. It's killing the mood and expensive. Ride only if you've got money and time to spare. The view and photos taken from outside are actually better than the ride itself,,,
,,Excellent,5,,Third trip on the Flyer and yet another different experience due to the development of Singapore and the varying weather conditions. This is a must every visit as the views of Singapore change so quickly. By example the Gardens by the Bay were not complete last trip. Excellent views and good food court within the facility. Very traditional.,,,
,,Ultimate experience for first time visitors,5,,"You would really be amazed and especially if its your first visit. On one side the garden and sea, other high rise buildings and highway. It was great.",,,
,,Flying High,4,,"My family of 6 visited the Singapore Flyer in March 2013 this year and appreciated its technological structure.
We are from Melbourne, Australia & have been waiting for our own great ferris wheel to function, only to be disappointed.

The Singapore Flyer is located near the shore of Marina Bay, on Marina Promenade & provides great views of Singapore!
Luckily, the capsule we rode in only had 11 passengers aboard, so most of us could take a seat during the 32 minute clockwise ride.
Take in the view, and we suggest you observe the other capsules & the construction itself as you ""fly"" over Singapore.
It's pricey, but worth a ride to experience it at least once in your life.
It is after all the new age Ferris wheel!",,,
,,Do it twice,3,,"Why twice? Well, by day and by night. The views (and views are what big wheels are really about) are quite different. Both are spectacular. Each merits the fare. Artistic photographers are probably better at night: mobile phone snappers will be happy in daylight. The gondolas are large and comfortable: granny will enjoy it, but the photo opportunities are limitless. Big Wheels are not exactly cutting edge technology, but this is a good example of its kind and will not disappoint travellers, especially the ""2 days to do Singapore"" variety.",,,
,,A truly good experience,5,,"There are many packages for the Singapore Flyer attraction. The more common ones are as follows:
1) The Singapore Flight
2) Singapore Flyer City Passes - Pass A and Pass B
The Singapore Flight takes you on a journey of dreams, followed by the 30 mins trip on the flyer, plus a walkabout at level one rainforest discovery, food trail and shops.

You can walk back to any of the bus stops to continue the journey if you want, only board the City Tour Orange bus though.",,,
,,One of the best things we went on in Singapore,5,,Just loved the Flyer. Even if you were afraid of heights you would feel quite safe. Unbelievably solidly constructed with individual airconditioned compartments. Wonderful views all around Singapore.,,,
,,Lovely views,4,,"Lovely views from the Flyer, enjoyable if you have the time but not a ""must do"". We went during daytime, but suspect the nighttime flight may be better option",,,
,,High rise view,5,,"As part of our Singapore stopover holiday we had vouchers for a trip on the flyer, if we had not we may not of gone on it then we would of missed a good trip.
The staff at the centre are most helpful and pleasant. We were lucky there was not much of a queue so not long to wait. although it is really high my partner still felt safe although he is some what fearful of heights. The speed was perfect not to fast and not to slow I was able to use my old camera to take shots without any blur.
We went during the daylight so very clear views across the bay and beyond although I am sure it would be just as interesting to go at night time, sunset would also be a good time to go. It is possible to book to eat on the flyer but to do this you really need to feel very comfortable with heights.
If we were to return to Singapore I would love to go on it again at night time maybe even try to do so at sunset.",,,
,,"Slightly Over-priced To ""Eat"" The View",2,,"After 3 years,I recently paid a visit to this magnificent structure and I must say,I knew why I did not came as often even though Im local.The ticket is a little too pricey for me and the short trip made it less then worth it because there wasnt much thing you could do once in the capsule,but to enjoy the view and take pictures.I think the best time to take this ride is between 6.30-7pm when the sun is setting and of cause anytime after as one could visually experience the night lights. Iwas a little annoyed by one foreign passenger who kept asking me questions throughout,after he knew I was local.The service there was pretty bad,especially at the souveneir shop,a guy who was impatient at the ticket counter just snatched my ticket and gave me a nonchalant look as I just wanted to view the photo me and my friend took.Its a great view from the capsule and nothing more.",,,
,,Champagne flight,5,,"My husband and I booked a champagne flight for 7pm (just after sunset). We were lucky enough to get the whole VIP pod to ourselves. If we'd had to share, I doubt I would have enjoyed the experience quite as much. The pod was awesome, with mood lighting, funky decor, and music piped in. I was so busy enjoying the pod and taking photos of the scenery, I nearly forgot to drink my champagne!",,,
,,Great view of Singapore,4,,"Its definitely a good experience to view Singapore from such a height. You can see some tourist destinations like gardens by the bay, merlion, Marinabay sands, F1 Track, Some big hotels, Ship yard and so on. The Journey will take around 30 mins, so choose a right time to visit to cover both Evening and Night look.

Ticket is around 30++ SGD, if you buy from some third party agents, you will get it for cheaper prices but u will get the odd timing slot like after noon or so.

They have different options like, you can have Dinner, Party or even Wedding while the Flyer is moving.",,,
,,Great View - Ride at Night,4,,"The Flyer offers a very cool, fairly unobstructed view of the bay and the Singapore Skyline. We opted for the Champagne ride. On arrival, we were escorted up to a smaller, private waiting area. About 5 minutes before time, we were led up to the flyer boarding area, and then placed in the Moet & Chandon car and handed a glass of champagne and a couple of chocolate bonbons.

The ride itself was admittedly touristy, but the view was less obstructed than the similar view front eh top of the Marina Bay Sands.

I can't really complain about the views, but I debate whether the ""special treatment"" afforded by buying the champagne package was worth the extra money. Probably the biggest benefit was that we got the car to ourselves.

No real complaints, but ""four dots"" because it was pretty expensive for what it was.",,,
,,Enjoy Singapore from Above,4,,"Nice experience to enjoy the Singapore view from above. You can see Garden by the Bay, Marina Bay, Merlion and the city view. The ride is about 30 minutes and the ticket fee is 33SGD, if you bought online you can get 10% discount",,,
,,Very high,5,,This was a great experience being so high above the city. The best views of any city. The air-conditioning was welcome. Our family of 4 enjoyed this experience and it helped us get our bearings of the city before we started exploring.,,,
,,"Brilliant, fantastic views",5,,"I booked this for our last night in Singapore and I had booked this sometime in advance. I booked a capsule and my wife and I had a Singapore Sling, there was 2 other persons in the capsule with us.
We got priority getting onto the flyer and we got served our Singapore Sling and the ride commenced. You hardly fell it moving. The views were amazing as it was dark but the bay area is all lit up. The ride itself takes about 30 minutes, the price is okay but if you want something a bit special book the Singapore Sling flight it is worth it.",,,
,,It is indeed a moving experience,4,,"Went there with my mom and sister, and learned that Singapore Flyer is the world鈥檚 largest observation wheel. Standing at a stunning 165 meters from the ground, the Flyer offers you breathtaking, panoramic views of the Marina Bay, Singapore island city and beyond. On the ride of approximately 45 minutes, I got to enjoy the panoramic view of Singapore and the life below... it's really amazing!",,,
,,360 Panoramic view of Singapore,5,,"This was great experience. We had the chance to experience the 360 degree panoramic view of Singapore as far as some of Indonesian islands. Singapore port, Hartland Housing Estates and Financial District all can view in the cubical. Should not miss out, if you are in Singapore",,,
,,One of a kind,5,,Experience a unique and beautiful flyer especially at night with the colorful lights on it. You can see it clearly and beautifully from The Garden by the bay. Get cheaper family package (two adults and one child) at only $68,,,
,,Awesome!,5,,This is where you'll see most of Singapore on higher ground. Cost around $33 for adult. There were a mini museum before you ride in the flyer.,,,
,,fantastic views,4,,"it would have to be one of the best views of Singapore, great photos. bit daunting if your not comfortable with heights",,,
,,A sight for sore eyes!,5,,Loved the flyer and the views over a large part of the island. Could see for miles and no queues. Took some brilliant photos.,,,
,,Well worth a Visit.,5,,"All very well organized attraction, good display as you walk through making your way to the entrance to the wheel, views from the wheel were good, they were dismantling the F1 which was very interesting",,,
,,fly high ;),4,,"1. you need to pay s$d 33 for a 30 minute ride in the singapore flyer, each cubicle is huge which can accomodate more or less 28 people, but luckily when we rode it, my family exclusively used one cubicle of the flyer

2. the view from the flyer is good you can appreciate singapore city more

3. it is better to rie the flyer during day time and with good weathermfor they stop operation when raining and after raining",,,
,,A must do when you visit Singapore!,5,,"This was my second time on the Flyer & I still loved the view from the top. From the top, you can see the absolutely gorgeous views both overlooking the city & ocean. Of the weather is good, it is a nice short walk from Marina Bay. We walked over the bridge & there were many nice photo moments. As it moves fairly slowly, you would have enough time to enjoy the view. Grab a map on the carriage & try to find the places from the top!",,,
,,Nice views but overpriced,3,,"Nice ride, slow enough to take nice pictures. May be a good idea if you are a tourist with little time in Singapore. There are benches in the cabin so you have the choice to stand or sit down. The ride took about 30 minutes. For what it is, we found the Flyer pretty overpriced - sets you back SGD33,- per person. Suggest you rather visit one of the many rooftop bars. At least you get an (expensive) drink for that money, and you'll have the same view and photo opportunities.",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,"Took the time to take a ride. This has to be one of the star attractions for visitors to this great country
which is full of places to see and things to do. The ride on the ""flyer"" takes in views of Singapore that you would not otherwise see. On a clear day you can actually see forever (as the song goes). You actually look down at the top of the Marina Bay Sands casino at the ""flyers"" highest point. It is something well worth the time and money to experience.Have a great ride!!!",,,
,,"What a view of Singapore, loved it",5,,"My daughter and I traveled there in May, I don't like heights, but decided to try the Flyer, Excellent, felt really safe, travels slowly, so you don't realise the height. Excellent",,,
,,Excellent,5,,"The views are spectacular, two our party are disabled and the staff were very helpful even slowing the wheel down to get on & off we were very lucky and had the pod to ours selves. Well worth the money",,,
,,Stopped on the bus route...,3,,Alright if just stopping on a hop-on-hop-off bus tour. I didn't pay to actually go on the Singapore Flyer because it would have been around $60-$70 for both of us to go. However we took a few photos and had a good time looking through the ponds in the shopping centre and it was still a great experience. Worth taking a look and a few photos :),,,
,,Great views ok price,4,,"Worth doing for the views and to get a handle on the singapore skyline. Better than the London eye in that a similar price, but lots or restaurants and bars around the base for refreshments beforehand after. And, no queues (Thursday). Friendly staff and we got a cabin to ourselves which was cool. Would recommend for sure.",,,
,,As one would expect,4,,"A nice experience, great view of surrounding area. If you've been on similar attractions in London and Brisbane, you know what to expect. I just booked the basic 'flight'. I went on a Wednesday night at around 7:30pm. There was no waiting, no crowds. Price slightly cheaper when booking via the Singapore flyer website rather than buying a ticket at the booth...you just show your QR code on your device on level two. There is also security screening before getting on. Also the obligatory photo in front of a green screen before entry. These photos are available for purchase when you disembark....$20 for one, or $60 for a set of 6. The staff were all friendly. Toilets and various food outlets also available. Bring a jacket, the aircon is freezing. Overall a nice experience. You get a good perspective of layout of the surrounding area, and also may give you some ideas of where to explore next...happy travels : )",,,
,,Currently the largest ferris wheel in the world,5,,"The wheel doesn't stop moving, but it moves slowly. You get a decent amount of time in the air when you're going around the top.",,,
,,For outstanding photos: must do!,5,,"We visited Singapore Flyer on our 1st day. We booked it as part of Singapore Flyer City Pass B Tour. If you've booked lots of tours then this Tourist Hub @ the flyer will become a meeting point for you during your stay. Visited on a weekday @ 9:30am, queues not very long. Large cabin with seats on inside to sit if you wish. The movement is slow so you won't feel dizzy or sick. Even if afraid of heights, the cabin is large enough to feel safe & secure. Great opportunities for photos in every direction. We got a great day: blue sky & clear: just the luck of the weather draw :) nice restaurants on ground & 1st level & souvenir gift shops. 3 nice food/drink outlets too: 2 x juice bars /fresh fruit & the other for coffee & kaya toast! You can also book for the ultimate drive (Ferrari or Lamborghini) here. This is also the starting point for most bus tours (Aquaduck, Funvee open top bus etc..). We chose Singapore Flyer as our one place to get great photos. We didn't bother going to observation deck on top of Marina Sands as all our photos from the Flyer were perfect. Well worth the visit & a must do for tourists.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer.,4,,The very first place of visit on 11th Sept 2013 in Singapore was SINGAPORE FLYER. A giant wheel revolving slowly as the highest observation post in the world is a busy place. One can view the entire city including close look at the MARINA BAY SANDS & GARDEN BY THE BAY and at some distance famous MERLION PARK & the ESPLANDE.. It has many facilities at the ground station which include City Tour & Duck city sighting offices.Green area with local herbs & shrubs with small water fall are added attractions at this place.We visited this place after sunset.,,,
,,Another great ride,5,,"This attraction dominates the waterfront on Singapore. Really nice, gentle ride at a leisurely pace. Once you get to the top the views are spectacular - the Singapore skyline includes some fabulous architecture and you can see it all from up here.",,,
,,Fly to see Singapore,5,,"it is very nice place where you can see singapore marina and golf clubs, it is high to see marina bay sands closer but not higher.",,,
,,Great Views of Singapore,5,,Absolutely loved this. The views of city from the top are stunning and spectacular. Must visit in Singapore,,,
,,On Top Of The World,5,,It was an awesome experience. A great opportunity to see the surrounds of Singapore. At 165 metres above sea level you can get a great view. We went just before dusk and during the rotation we got to see the lights of Singapore come on. The staff were friendly and attentative. There was a large noisey group behind my wife and I and when I asked if we could not go with the group he obliged and placed us with a mother and her son. $33pp well spent.,,,
,,Nice place to enjoy the harbor view,5,,The ride does move pretty slowly but the cars are big enough to move around or sit and relax. Recommend for families.,,,
,,"Safe, tall and very slow",3,,"Very large pods, very tall wheel moving very slow. One revolution per ""ride"". Large pods can hold 10+ people nicely with great views. Rock solid stability and good glass to take photos through.",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"Great Inexpensive way to see the surrounds of Singapore. Nice and airy cabin that doesn't get packed so p,entry of great photo opportunities",,,
,,Amazing view of Singapore,4,,The experience was good. Looking at Singapore from the highest point of the flyer is amazing.My Kids enjoyed the experience,,,
,,Excellent View,4,,"Excellent View, There is a cabin for Children s.... littel difficult to locate the enterance if you wan tto reach walking Ticket discount are a bit complex",,,
,,"Not a must-visit, but still quite nice",4,,"Great to visit if you want to kill some time in Singapore. The view from here is wonderful especially by sundown. Aside from the view, a good reason to go here is it's still the tallest observation wheel in the world: feel what's like to be literally on the top of the world!",,,
,,During F1 Qualifying!,5,,"This was just the best. Firstly, it was free due to the F1. There was no line up at all. Plus we got to see qualifying from right above the track. What an amazing view!",,,
,,"Overrated, Old, Expensive Attraction",3,,"The Singapore Flyer is one of the iconic attractions in Singapore. It was made to be a tourist spot. The view few years back was great. Still is. But not the best anymore. Even the Skypark on Marina Bay Sands (only 20 S$) offers a better view. Here you end up paying 30 S$ for a 30 min ride, with no guide (few years back they gave headphones which used to show you around Singapore).

Skip the Flyer, rather visit the Skypark. And if you want a constant view, choose a room in the Swissotel Stamford. Ask them for a room above the 50th floor on the Marina Bay side of the hotel.",,,
,,Nice Views!,4,,"Great views of the city. Air-conditioned ride. If you go when it's not too busy, they only put about 10 people on a capsule so there's plenty of room to view the city from all sides and without a crowd of people. Worth a ride to the top of the world's tallest :)",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,A great feature for Singapore and a terrific vantage point to view the city. We did the SF at night and I would throughly recommend this time. The lights of the city and the waterfront are stunning.,,,
,,great Views,5,,"this is a wonderful experience, a full 360 view - tip don't go when it's cloudy and dont forget your camera!",,,
,,Flyer,4,,"Great view of the city, get a good perspective of how 'big' singapore actually is. Only downer was the cost - from memory it was about $25-30SD each.",,,
,,Good but not the best,3,,Had a lot of expectations when we went there but the experience was just about average Its well maintained and looks attractive Bit on the costlier side with around 30 Sing dollars Nearest station is Promenade but 7 - 8 min walk from there too.,,,
,,If you like ferris wheels and views,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is currently the largest ferris wheel in the world. It will however be topped by the one in Las Vegas next year. It's your typical large-scale wheel, with observation cars that can fit 10-20 people. The wheel doesn't stop movine, but it moves slowly. You get a decent amount of time in the air when you're going around the top.

I would say though that I would choose to either to the Singapore Flyer or go atop the Marina Bay Sands. They both have good views, but they're both very similar views.",,,
,,It is best at night!,4,,"Beautiful view!! If you are in Singapore, it is worth check it out. Try going at night when you can see the city lights.",,,
,,Somewhat Expensive For What It Is,3,,"Yes, there is a nice view from the ferris wheel, but unlike most Singaporean attractions, the Singapore Flyer is a somewhat expensive attraction. I can't remember exactly what we paid for 3 adults but I think it was almost 35-40 US. That being said, it is an experience and I did see on their website that they have 10 dollar senior tickets on certain days.",,,
,,OR SINGAPORE EYE,5,,"Take a look at the Singapore skyline, the sea, Marina bay sands, and all of singapore. Lovely ride. Lot of people so book early. Photography and videography allowed. Try to go towards evening so that you get a glimpse of daylight and later as the evening lights are switched on over the city, it looks gliterring from up there.",,,
,,Great view,5,,"This is the worlds highest ferris wheel and it is!! It takes about 30 minutes to go around and the view is amazing once at the top. The carriages are big and the ride is smooth. When I went on, wasn't very busy and only about 4 of us in a carriage built for about 30 people.

Not recommended if you are not good with heights",,,
,,gentle ride and nice views,4,,"The ride takes 30 minutes - and is comfortable... and uncrowded the morning we went.
But the tip of Marina Bay sand is higher if that makes a difference - but don't do both.

What is annoying is those ubiquitous photographers pushing fake - green screen photos - for a huge price -",,,
,,Definitely Something You Will Want to Check Off Your Bucket List,5,,"Having read a few articles about things to do and see while in Singapore, I already knew before I got there that this was something I had to do, something I needed to check off my bucket list -- A Ride Upon The Flyer. My travelmate wasn't willing to venture upward with me, so I went by myself and was joined by a family of four from India. Up to 28 people can fit in the capsule, so we had plenty of room to walk about since there were only 5 of us. At times I was happy sitting low and finding a center of gravity on the bench (even, admittedly, clutching it at times) in the capsule, as the upward ascent is quite breathtaking. My capsulemates didn't speak English, but I was thoroughly entertained by their exclamations of glee in their native tongue...the glee I speak of was found by experiencing magnificent views in all four directions from a height of 541 feet UP! My ""flight"" was in the early afternoon, which provided plenty of daylight for me to see all there was to see in all four directions...from WAY UP there atop The Flyer.",,,
,,Wonderful night,5,,"After have a wonderful morning in the zoo, my family decided to go to Singapore Flyer at 6p.m. It was an amazing memory, I and my husband had a beautiful time together there, we saw the city from the flyer with the night lights of Singapore when my son started playing his new video game we bought for him last night. We took many beautiful sunset shot there.",,,
,,Not worth the money,2,,"$33 SGD for one 30 minute rotation on a 150 metre ferris wheel.

Do yourself a favour and go to the the Marina Bay Sands Hotel's Skydeck and for $20 SGD you can stay for as long as you like, 50 odd floors up and a much better view of Singapore.

No wonder this attraction is not doing so well.

There are some very rude staff here, especially the young lady (and I use that word very liberally to describe her) at the security screening speciation. Rude, abrupt, and a poor attitude from this person.

The food court was closed to the public because of a private function was due to commence, but at least put up a sign saying so rather the yelling the fact.

I expected better of Singapore. The attraction has done nothing to enhance Singapore's reputation",,,
,,worth the money,5,,"we paid $28 and the 360degree views were awesome , being the biggest moving observation post in the world it was a great experience ,nice walk later around the marina bay restaurants ,bars and free entertainment",,,
,,Great value and views,5,,"We went at Sunset, views were wonderful and then the city lights came on and it was magical. Glad we picked a capsule with no kids though.",,,
,,Champagne Flight on The Singapore Flyer,5,,"We enjoyed the Champagne Flight which we booked prior to arriving in Singapore.
It enables us to have a cabin on our own as we were the only people on the Flight at that time.
To see Singapore sipping on a Champagne and enjoying some strawberries provided was delightful.
You get a very good overview of Singapore from the Singapore Flyer and particularly so when all the light are on.
A trip not to be missed if you are travelling to Singapore.",,,
,,Fun Flight,4,,"It's a tourist attraction - Everything looks good except for the price. The price is on the higher price for just going around, but you do get a lovely view of Singapore especially at night with all the lights!

Do it if you have some money to spare or else just take a beautiful picture next to it.",,,
,,Good View at a price!,4,,"Very expensive for a 1/2 hour trip. Beware it doesn't stop so you get on and off while it is still moving.

Great view, but windows could be cleaner. To get the full effect you need to go at night otherwise the view is nothing special.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,4,,"One of the must do sites in Singapore. well worth the visit, even if at the end of the ride you have to exit through the ""gift shop""",,,
,,Birdseye View,4,,"We had the choice of The Flyer or Marina Bay to have a Birdseye view, we chose this so we could see from all angles. The bonus being that they were setting up the F1 track so we were closer to the action.",,,
,,Well paying the extra in the Moet capsule,5,,"Really enjoyed the Singapore flyer - we opted to go into the Moet capsule, which I believe was well worth the extra, you don't need to queue up and that little bit more special to have a glass of Moet whilst taking in the sights. There was only three couples in our capsule so plenty of room. Loved the view of Singapore skyline at night time.",,,
,,Excellent Skyline views,5,,"The flyer overlooks the Motor racing track and affords excellent vies of the Singapore skyline in one go. The visuals are stunning and different on the way up and on the way down!

Well worth the money!

Tip! No point in taking the official photograph as it is hugely expensive. Bring your own device!",,,
,,Great view of the city,5,,It is a unique experience to see the city from the flyer. Try to go in the morning or late afternoon to see enjoy it more and be able to take better shots.,,,
,,Great for adults and teens... boring for active kids,4,,"Try to visit this attraction when you have no young kids in tow and at night time. My seven-year-old son enjoyed it for about five minutes then started playing with the other kids.

My husband and I had a great time enjoying the breathtaking view and the night lights of Singapore though.

FAMILY package: US$63 (2 adults 1 child)
Adult (13 years or older): US$27
Child (3-12 years old): US$17
Below 3 years old: FREE",,,
,,SINGAPORE FLYER.,5,,"The biggest moving observation post in the world is this giant moving wheel.Its ground station with city tour bus booking offices,food court,& souvenir shop is worth visiting with family.From this place one can take pictures of Marina Bay Sands & Garden by the Bay .",,,
,,Go if you HAVE to.,3,,"I liked the view from Marina Bay Sands Skypark better. Its best to go to Marina Bay Sands Skypark if you wish to take your time to see the view, instead of spending more and spending just half an hour for the view in an enclosed capsule of a giant wheel.",,,
,,It is fantastic,5,,If you are not afraid of heights it is a fantastic experience to have a good look at the city. The speed is very slow allows you sufficient time for good observation.,,,
,,Great Way to See Singapore,5,,Take in all the wonderful sights of Singapore. This flyer doesnt stop. you just hop in & hop out. Convenient for older people too. highly recommend this. TIP: its a 35 minute ride. go right after sunset.,,,
,,perfect. view after 6pm,5,,you have to go in 6pm. because you can see sunset. after dark time. you can see amazing view of Singapore if you go in 6pm. you can see 20minutes in day time. after 25minutes in dark time. towers in light,,,
,,Why not,4,,"Its one of those attractions you do because it is the biggest and best of its kind. You get a great view of the city, harbour and surrounding areas. The capsules are large, air conditioned and the ride is smooth, my kids liked it and my wife (scared of heights) even managed the 30 minutes.",,,
,,Great experience. Poor souvenirs,4,,"Everything about Spore Flyer was perfect: the environment, surrounding area, the service & hospitality, ticketing, clean, view, easy to access, rest room, food/ dining, gallery (pictures, miniatures, some science stuffs), etc. I highly recommend this place. The ride itself took 30 minutes.

The only part missing was a good collection of souvenirs/ memorabilia. Yes, they have t-shirt, fridge magnets, keychains, poscards, etc. But that's all. I was hoping they have miniatures. Most attraction landmarks have miniatures. But not Singapore Flyer.",,,
,,nice view but a bit pricy,3,,"The view is nice, better go during the sunset so that can get to see the difference between day and night. But the price is a bit expensive. People who interested in this can look for some package that included the flyer's ticket and also other entrance ticket (etc garden by the bay).",,,
,,Do not miss this!,5,,"The Singapore flyer is a must. To really see and get excited about Singapore you have to ride the flyer. The sights are breath taking, and you can dine I it as well. Loved it!",,,
,,Fly Flyer in Singapore,5,,"A spectacular tour of around 45 minutes for a single circular trip. The view is great and the comfort in the Cart is simply perfect. 165 meters over the ground, moving slowly and a possibility for the creative Photographer to make lots of good shots.... :-)",,,
,,A must do!,5,,"This was pretty incredible! We were planning on waiting until night time, but decided to go on it in the day as there was no real waiting time. We were able to have a capsule all to ourselves which was so good! We all loved it... great views and quite a unique experience! It does go very slowly and after 15 mins or so the novelty wears off a bit and you are ready to get off by the end of the circle but it was really incredible! I imagine night time would be really special!",,,
,,Excellent view of Singapore,5,,"Best to go there at night so you can see all the city lights. Beautiful view of everything around Singapore. Both calming and breath-taking, this could be a great place to go on a date as well.",,,
,,Plenty of time to take photos and very safe,5,,Great views of Singapore and a very slow and safe ride. Carriages are huge. I got a free ticket with my stopover package and not sure if I would have paid the SG$30 for a ticket which seems a lot but I'm glad I went on it.,,,
,,Breathtaking view,4,,"The view is amazing! Though I have little to say about this, since it's only a flyer , it's very luxurious and fancy . That makes it more special. I really enjoy going to the Singapore Flyer every time .",,,
,,excellant views from a glass ball,5,,"a very smooth ride to Sentosa Island in a glass bubble the views were fantastic. I personally don't like heights, but this didn't bother me in the slightest even coming back in the middle of a thunderstorm, the car didn't sway or swing.",,,
,,Fun experience,4,,"We just turned up and got straight on, and this was early afternoon. Great views over the bay and down onto the Formula 1 track. Liked the photo they took. Nice souvenir of a pleasant experience.",,,
,,F1 flyer!,4,,During the 2013 Formula 1 I went on the flyer. Entry was free as it was part of your race ticket. The views were spectacular and it was not to long and not too short. Plenty of space within the cabin to move around and see all angles of the city. Great thing to do to get a birds eye view of Singapore.,,,
,,Awesome,4,,"The concept,breathtaking views and the way it's been handled by pleasing personalities makes this an awesome experience",,,
,,Singapore..bird view,4,,Easy way to see Singapore in 20 minutes. Must see. You will great photos of yours i f you pay 20 $/photo( 60$ for 6),,,
,,Man made marvel - Aerial view of the city,5,,"the flyer is such a marvelous way of viewing the city from up above. the compartments keep moving very slowly allowing us to take pictures, get the full panoramic view, sit and enjoy the man made beauty that Singapore is!",,,
,,Excellent View,5,,Do not miss it while visiting Singapore. It has excellent view specially before sunset when weather is clear. Just few minutes walking distance from MRT station.,,,
,,Once is enough. . .Better options in Singapore,3,,"Before the Marina Bay Sands was built, the Singapore Flyer offered the best view in town. If you go to the Flyer, be sure to get a discount ticket for this 40-60 minute ride (I forgot the exact duration) with the SQ board pass privileges. The best view is at the peak which only last for about 1-2 minutes. A better value and a better view can be had by going to the Marina Bay Sand's Skypark which allows you to stay as long as you wish until closing.",,,
,,Great Views,5,,"Excellent attraction, bit pricey unless you have the free tickets from the Singapore stopover. (which we had)",,,
,,The view is awesome.,5,,"This is a great way to see the sights Singapore has to offer, It was a very enjoyable experience and something worth doing when in Singapore.",,,
,,"If you do only one thing in Singpore City, then experience this !!!",5,,"The Singapore Flyer, is similar to many other rotating wheels, that have an observation deck on each of the capsules. But this is the best in the part of the world. The Flyer enabled me to enjoy the rapid development and to view the harbour, Golf Courses, Parks, Buildings, river, and the sea... all from the comfort of an air conditioned capsule which took 30 mins to complete the rotation.

The costs are $ 33.00 Singapore dollars or $ 24.00 if you are over 60 years old, and I regarded this a great value for money. Sadly because I was on a tight schedule, I was unable to spend time, walking around the base, but there are bars, coffee shops and such like all around the base and also inside the complex",,,
,,Great views!!,5,,Girl friend and I went up at night. We really enjoyed the Experiance. Amazing views and very peaceful at the slow speeds it travels at.,,,
,,Great views,4,,"We really enjoyed our trip on the Flyer. It isn't cheap (33 SGD pp), but many of the attractions in Singapore are free or cost little, so on the whole this balanced out across our trip. The queue was quiet (we went at about 11am). Great views across the city and harbour.",,,
,,time flies on the Flyer,4,,Thought this was great - a birds eye view of the city. Will go back for a night time view too. A must for any visitors,,,
,,Best observation wheel!,5,,"After visiting a couple of other observation wheels in the world this one appeared to be the best! The view are amazing from the capsules, the 30minute ride runs like a 3 minute, we are so impressed by it!

Just one perk- come to the wheel just after it opens in the morning - there are not so many people there and you can be lucky to have a private capsule, like we had with my husband at 8am on a weekday!",,,
,,A great view,5,,Been meaning to visit the flyer for the past 3 years that we have been to Singapore and have finally done it. Well worth a visit with great views over the bay and the city. Get there early in the morning or during lunch. We got there at about 11.30am and had to queue for half an hour. When we got off half an hour later it was dead quiet.,,,
,,Touch the sky,5,,"It was very interesting to be in there, i felt like i was floating in there and the time seems to be passing slowly, enough for you to enjoy the view.",,,
,,do visit if in singapore,5,,this flyer ride gives you a full 360 degree view of singapore city. try visiting around sunset time if you can to take the advantage of evening sunlight view and also of after sunset when the city lights are on..,,,
,,View from the top,5,,"The most fantastic views over Singapore. We went here midweek at around 1.30pm. There were no crowds at all and we were able to enjoy the lead up to getting in the capsule - which we had to ourselves, fabulous. The whole ride takes about 30 min. We had a great day to enjoy the views and take great pics. This is an amazing experience and should not be missed",,,
,,High flyer,5,,What a view of the city and the ships in the straits. Higher than the London eye and with the cars holding up to 24 people but only two of us at the time plenty of room and the cars don't rock or swing. A good 30 mins ride.,,,
,,Worth to try in SG!,5,,"You can view the Singapore area, feels like you are in the clouds and high above. Best time to ride there is around 5-6pm. Where can still see the whole area. The ride will just last for about 30 minutes and you're not allowed to eat inside. This is the biggest Ferris Wheel, I have tried and it rotates slowly, so people who are afraid of heights and motions, this is a good try.

You can buy ticket once you arrived the place. Good spot to take pictures of the whole place, where you can view most of the spectacular landmark in SG.

Along the way, you'll find the history of the Flyer itself before you reach the final jump on the flyer.

It's great to try as well.",,,
,,High above the bay,5,,"A great way to view the bay area,and the Grand Prix track,Easy to book tickets and the cost is $33 singapore dollars.",,,
,,Wanted to come back at night,4,,"Great views, when we went they didn't pack the viewing capsules with many people giving us just the post-wedding privacy we needed and allowed us to walk around easily.",,,
,,big recommention,5,,"One of the best attractions in Singapore, we were in there at night so less queues, didn't see much at night to be honest, but with that experience you can't go wrong. Also if I remember right, if you are an American Express card holder, you will get 10% off or half price? at Marina Bay鈥榮 Sky Park.",,,
,,Must Visit,5,,"The view from the flyer makes it a must visit attraction in Singapore. We happened to get there in the evening just before sundown because of which we got to enjoy the view in the day and the night.
A must visit whenever you are in Singapore.",,,
,,excellent view of the city at night,5,,This was a fantastic way to view the city. Overlooking the gardens at night was very pretty. Recommend it to any travelers to Singapore.,,,
,,Once is enough,3,,"I rode it once and it is enough. It wasn't a bad experience or anything. It's just that the ride felt like the longest time due to the speed or the lack of it.

So if you want a breathtaking view of the whole Singapore, this is where you need to be.

And after you finished, there's a tasty ice cream stall just at the exit to reward yourself for completing a whole big circle.",,,
,,Great View,5,,You get a great view of Singapore by day & it would have been a beautiful by night. The queue moves reasonably quickly and well worth a visit.,,,
,,Awesome!,5,,Must Visit! Full View of entire City! Should be first on Singapore Visit. Gives Visual view of whats where. We miss the night Trip! :(,,,
,,"Awesome view, awesome feelings",5,,"Before coming here, I've already known about this place through Discovery, so I was very excited. As I got in the cabin and had a ride, I knew it was much more than I even expected. Really hard to describe how great it is to have a full view of Marina Bay Sands, knowing that people actually built the whole place on water. Such an amazing experience.

I read on the brochure that they have a special service to book a whole cabin for dinner. Hopefully I can try that for a special occasion in the future.",,,
,,best in asia,5,,I had a wonderful experience in the flyer it was one of the most adventures and thrilling experience in Singapore i had a beautiful view of the entire singapore such a clean city and such a wonderfffull place one should visit it is situated in the heart of the city where you get view of the tallest building of Singapore one should visit only in the night to have the thrill you have beautiful joints where you can have a nice cofee and what not there are many place to visit and all are very good such a clean city i have not seen though i have travelled a lot hats of to the beautiful city.,,,
,,The view,5,,Wow go at night the lights of the city are fantastic The pods are roomy easy to view all surrounding sites The gardens all light up look awesome Not to be missed,,,
,,Dinner out,5,,"My husband and I booked the four course dinner on the Singapore Flyer. We took a taxi to the VIP lounge, ordered a bottle of wine, relaxed and waited for the time to go on the flyer. It was will organized, the food was excellent. They served the first two course in one rotation, on loaded and loaded the second two courses and continued for a second rotation, it was amazing to see them work without the flyer stopping, they have it down to a science. There where five tables inside, it wasn't cramped, lots of room for the waiter to move around and serve. It was a beautiful clear night and the view was spectacular. A must do if you are every in Singapore.",,,
,,A great Singapore attraction,5,,"This was our first experience of these massive sightseeing ""wheels"" that have become part of the landscape in many major cities. It was a very user-friendly attraction and we found the overview the ride gave us of Singapore to be very helpful for the rest of our stay. The panorama views were amazing and provided many photo opportunities.
Highly recommended.",,,
,,Superb views,5,,The views of the city are fabulous and my elderly mother particularly enjoyed herself after all the attention she was given from the staff - they stopped the 'cabin' so she could walk across at her own speed and the ride was very smooth. In fact my mother was confident enough to get up and walk around the cabin looking at all the different views.,,,
,,Great Views,5,,"We were not going to do this on our trip to Singapore but had some time and we are so glad we did. These are huge pods and they give you amazing views over Singapore and great photo opportunities.

We went around 6pm so managed to get photos in the daylight and also at sunset-lovely",,,
,,Spectacular Views of Singapore!,5,,"We loved this attraction! Spacious cabins where you get some amazing views of Singapore! Very comfortable as capsules are air conditioned with a centre seat, although you are free to move about the cabin. We went on at night and the city lights were breathtaking from each angle. I'm sure that it would have been great to see the sunset from here, but we definitely enjoyed having no long lines to contend with.",,,
,,Kind of pricey but well worth the experience.,5,,"I don't think one should visit Singapore and not go on the Flyer. The height shows great views from 360 degrees. Never really felt unsafe but if you have a significant fear of heights, you might want to reconsider. Very enjoyable.",,,
,,Spectacular,4,,This was a memorable experience. The view from this cabin was wonderful and getting on and off works like clock work. This is a good way to see landmarks if you haven't got a lot of time in Singapore. The price is not exhorbatant and it's a must for most people!,,,
,,Should experience once,5,,"The experience is worthwhile. We loved it and so did the kids! And when you reach the top, a recorded voice fills the capsule telling you that you are on top of the world. What a wonderful Feeling! We did see the islands of Indonesia and Malaysia.",,,
,,Far better than expected,5,,"I was talked into going on the Singapore flyer by my partner who wanted to try it. While reluctant at first I soon wormed to the experience.

We were in a gondolier with only two other couples (they had separated us from a school trip which arrived at the same time) the gondolier could have accommodated many other people. the head sets were in good repair and condition and they told you as you went what to expect and where to look. While not as high as the Sky Park it is interactive and well worth the time.",,,
,,Flyer,5,,"What a great view you can see right out to sea ,all over Singapore most spectacular view a must to do while in singapore",,,
,,For 360degrees view,4,,"It's costly, you can get a similar views from some skyscrapers. But you would need to view from several. Information map is useful to bring along when you ride in the capsule, otherwise the map on the ceiling of each will do. It's a well-organized, modern , stable and fun Ferris wheel ride. It's not cheap for a ride, I won't do it again, but once is good for the experience.",,,
,,like flying,5,,"What a great view of the harbour and surrounds so glad we did this one , you get to see most of Singapore from the Flyer the ride is so smooth you dont know it's moving , if you come to Singapore do this for sure but make sure it's a clear day for maximum views",,,
,,view,5,,We can see Singapore this city. The sun set and lights coming are very beautiful. Maybe you can relax here and to see views.,,,
,,Worthy of a visit,4,,"We viewed the city from the Flyer by day. Wonderful views. We did this a day or so after we did the the tower at the Imbriah lookout on Sentosa Is. Although it is a shorter time experience, we preferred the rotating tower on Sentosa and it was a lot less expensive also.",,,
,,Beautiful city view,5,,Good and relax and dine on sky.. it was a different feel when you are as couple. Inside food and wine are good in reasonable price.,,,
,,Nice views,4,,There were no queues when we visited and the views from the top of the ride were very nice. Everything was very well organised.,,,
,,View Singapore from above in comfort,4,,The flyer is a great way to view this magic city and what you can see from the top is very special we managed to time the flight to take in a view of daylight and changing into night. Two very different views both very impressive. Well worth visiting this attraction.,,,
,,A must see,5,,"Excellent views all around Singapore, well worth doing this and also try the food downstairs as it's all set out like it used to be years ago and is well worth trying the different varieties on offer, you can have a meal on board if your after something special and we even saw a wedding taking place and it was beautiful.",,,
,,Simply Brilliant,5,,"This is a must do, twice once during the day and once at night to get a great Singapore Experience. Get to see so much in all directions, and worth the admission price, best to bundle with the duck tour as well.",,,
,,Listen to the Commentary,4,,"The view is great, its not just about the view (because you might get that in some hotels) but what I liked was the commnetary regarding the landscape, buildings, feng shu .... listen to the commentary and then watch, I think both must be done",,,
,,Super views of Singapore,5,,"If in Singapore the FLYER is a must, the views are fantastic, you are actually next to the Grand Prix Grid, but until you start to move you would not realize this. For anybody who is a little afraid of heights the speed is that slow, you have a job to know you are moving, the coaches take about a dozen people, no more and there is plenty of room, they are glassed on four sides so you miss nothing. Give it a go.",,,
,,Great way to finish your trip!,5,,Decided to save this up for our last day and it was worth it! I am scared of heights but never felt unsafe during the whole revolution. Amazing views and aircon comfort. Clean and very enjoyable.,,,
,,If You Have Been On The London Eye - Don't Miss The Singapore Flyer,5,,Breathtaking views of Singapore by day or by night - ours was by day and on a clear day you can see to the Coastline of Indonesia. Clean and well organised (as we found all Singapore Tours to be). Chambers rotate very slowly giving you plenty of time for the sightseeing and photography.,,,
,,What a amazing experience.,5,,"Was a little scared but I am so happy I overcame my fear It was the best experience ever. Did not even realise it was moving, it is air conditioned has seats, it was fantastic. Singapore is such a beautiful place. I was able to use my seniors card so that was a bonus. If in Singapore make a effort to go on flyer",,,
,,Whether the Flyer is good depends on what else you've seen,3,,"I live in Singapore so am very accustomed to seeing the Singapore skyline, the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the shipping in the Singapore Straits, so my experience of the Flyer probably differs from that of a tourist. On the other hand, tourists may have visited the equivalent attraction in other places and find that it doesn't stand out - or that it does compare very well with their experience elsewhere.

I went on the Flyer as part of a corporate function, so I didn't personally directly pay for the experience. Nevertheless, in my opinion the advertised price for the Flyer is unreasonably high and I find it difficult to see that it would be a worthwhile experience for a family of, say, four at the overall cost they would incur. However, if it's included as part of a package tour, it'd be worthwhile setting aside an hour to ride the Flyer provided weather on the day is clear. Or if money's not an object, you have some spare time and the weather is good, then why not give the Flyer a try?

Without the height, of course, much of the same scenery can be seen having a cup of coffee or even a light meal (though I'm not recommending either the quality of the food or the standard of service high) at the Marina Bay Golf Course, which is open to the public. This is a particularly good option for those without a good head for heights!",,,
,,Brilliant,5,,"Really enjoyed our trip on the Singapore flyer, fabulous views. Not sure of the cost of entry, as we were attending the F1 so it was free of charge. Worth a visit.",,,
,,Can do,3,,Expected abit more out of the amenities in the area which i found sightly lacking. The whole trip around took about 40-45mins. Great for the kids,,,
,,Amazing Wow,5,,The whole Singapore Flyer experience was fantastic. The informative walk through the preview section the smooth loading of customers onto the flyer and of course the amazing views from the wheel itself. air conditioned cabins made the trip most comfortable. This is a must for anyone visiting Singapore,,,
,,A must to visit place in Singapore,4,,Excellent view and night life is good around the place. Fireworks near by too. This is the place to be.,,,
,,Best to go to see the sunset,5,,Try and get to the capsule at 6.30 pm ( 7th Oct) you can see the sun set and the lights coming on the wheel. Amazing views.,,,
,,Great view at night!,5,,"Singapore flyer is a very nice place to view the city-by-night. Of-course, day view is also good, but to experience it by evening is heavenly. The boxes are air-conditioned and can easily accommodate about 10 people in each one of them. As you move higher, the view becomes breath-taking. The harbour on one side, the famed Singapore high-rises on the other side, fully illuminated, adds to the beauty. The street below with all the cars moving makes the trip really worthwhile. All in all, a must visit to enjoy the beauty of Singapore. It takes about half hour to complete the ride and for those who prefer, candle-lit dinner is arranged on board.",,,
,,Lovely views from different angles,5,,30 minutes to complete the ride - really great views of the city and F1 pits etc. There is a Hawker Centre designed around the ride which is very authentic and worth a visit.,,,
,,Think carefully before you decide,3,,"In my opinion, the Flyer is a very good idea for the tourism to have a look from above. However, when you got there,you should think about going up there vs going on top of the Marina Bay Sand. You can see that they are the same high and quite equal in expend. So my advise is you should only take one of them. singapore Flyer or Marina Bay sand's top.",,,
,,Fabulous views of Singapore,5,,"Great way to get a birds eye view of the Singapore Harbour and surrounds. Travel in air conditioned comfort, with great views - loved it !!",,,
,,A fine way to see the city,4,,"Having been on the Lodon Eye several times I knew pretty much what to expect but of course the view was really amazing. With the ships in the harbour, the skyline of the Financial District and of course the wonder of the Marina Bay Sands complex you knew you were somewhere amazing. In addition, the preparations for the Grand Prix were in full swing. Shame the flyer is so quiet, it is a remarkable feat of engineering,.",,,
,,Definitely worth the money,5,,With no student fares it seemed a little expensive for our family of four but we decided to go ahead and we weren't disappointed. The view all the way around is spectacular and it is such a funky structure that we thoroughly enjoyed the experience.,,,
,,Great views,4,,Went early in the morning and were lucky enough to walk straight on - only six of us inside the car: allowed us to move freely around for photographs etc. Great views - lucky the weather was clear.. The hawker style eating places below the flyer were interesting - had our first Tiger Beer after the ride.,,,
,,Fly on the Flyer,5,,I was lucky that there was not that many people when I visited the Flyer. It meant we could move around easily to take in the view all round. It was so stunning to see the thunderstorm coming towards us over the Marina Bay.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,We went at noon the day we left and it was an incredible view. You can see Marina bay and it's a big cabin so you can walk about inside the cabin. It was a fun experience. The Flyer goes slow so you can enjoy the view in the 30 min ride.,,,
,,"Cant compare, never been to london eye",4,,"That is great place to be for an over view of Singapore. I went there around sunset. Given that there is not much high building or special construction within Singapore but that is great to see the yet-opened Botentic Garden, the F1 race course and the city scene.",,,
,,Aweful View of Singapore,5,,"It is the most important place to visit in Singapore. Skyhigh air-conditioned box packed slow motioned city view, will let you snapload your camera with effective motion.",,,
,,Spectacular View,5,,We went on the flyer at sunset on a week night. There wasn't much of a cue. Prior to boarding we went through a maze of information. There were approximately 14 people in the pod. You board as it moves slowly. The flyer goes around slowly and takes 30 minutes. The views are spectacular across the bay to the city. Marina Bay Sands is close and provides proportion. There are food shops on the ground level with a huge variety. We also went for a walk along the river.,,,
,,Ferris wheel,3,,"It is a good way to Singapore through a bird's eye view, but very slow and it is very expensive at $35 and can be skipped",,,
,,Great ride,5,,"The twenty five minute ride gave us a whole amazing view of Singapore. When the weather was good, you can even see the farthest island nearby. It was also very beautiful at night to see the shining neon and the bright F1 race track. And the ride was very smooth and the car inside was spacious and comfortable.",,,
,,Fabulous,5,,Great view of the city. Staff helpful. Only a few people in our cabin so we could move around and look out all sides. There is a hawker style food court underneath the flyer ... A must for local food,,,
,,Spectacular Views,4,,The views from the flyer are just so spectacular and the best is to capture when at highest position..The view of sands bay marina is so awesome...Overall a nice experience to remember,,,
,,"Amazing, during the F1!",4,,"With our tickets for the F1 weekend we could go up in the flyer for free!

We went up during the day, amazingly clear skies and had the Porsche Cup cars out for practice beneath us. Great switching between the views out in the distance and the cars going around!

We went around again in the evening, for free again! This time the F1 cars were out practicing, so loud even up on the flyer. The views at night were more spectacular and we had planned to go up at night if we were going to pay!",,,
,,Pricey but worth it,4,,"My partner and I had dinner on the Singapore Flyer last night. When we arrived, we were greeted by a friendly staff member and told where to go. We went into the flyer lounge, but were disappointed with the limited and expensive drinks list. Then when we went to order they didn't have what we wanted, not once but twice. We boarded the flyer along with 4 other couples. We were promptly served our entree and soup on the first lap around. On the second lap we got our main and desert. My partner and I were very pleased with the food, but felt it was all a little rushed, having a 4 course meal in an hour. The view around was spectacular. We got many photos on board. I think it is something to splurge and do. Afterwards you can walk to the marina bay sands and go to the casino.",,,
,,Worth it.,5,,"Amazing views - well worth it an amazing experience, best views of Singapore. Not at all closed in lots of space in each capsule",,,
,,Well worth it!,5,,Amazing views.Gives you a great view of the whole of Singapore. Capsules are big and you don't feel closed in.,,,
,,A beautiful view!,3,,"For $33 per person, my husband and I went on the Flyer around 8pm. It's a 30 minute ride all the way around the ferris wheel. I got some great pictures from high above of the night skyline of Singapore. It's worth doing once!",,,
,,Must do in Singapore!!,4,,"I had a great time inside the Singapore Flyer on 2 occasions, which is on the daytime and nightime. Both views are great and having a clear view on the skyline. However, during daytime at around 3-4pm, the cabin can be slightly warmer than expected despite it being air-conditioned...overall it's a wonderful experience!",,,
,,In the sky,5,,Gives you a whole perspective of the size of Singapore and the ships in the harbour. Carriage is big enough to fit 2 cars in!!!!!!!!!!!!,,,
,,Great views,4,,"This is a great experience. Ideally for best value you should get a combined ticket along with a duck tour or hopper ticket. We did the duck tour in the morning and then returned at night to ride the flyer. If you can get on it at around 745, you will see the giant tree light show from the Gardens at the Bay, they are spectacular. Also seemed to be no queues at night. The imagination section before you get on isn't really much, but children might enjoy it. There is a 'food trail' underneath the Flyer for cheap 'street' food. Not the best, but OK.",,,
,,Good View For,4,,"Good for: Bird's Eye view of the city!, lights, City Overview, A special night out, night life. Singapore's magnificent cityscape from a height of 165m on the world's largest observation wheel.",,,
,,Beautiful Views,4,,"We went in the F1 week. The road was closed leading to the flyer because of F1, so had to walk a couple of minutes @ 500 mts to reach the flyer, on the ground floor, they give you a brief history and making of the flyer. Once inside the flyer (capsule), it slowly moves upwards, gradually @ 20 minutes you can see the whole city, its at hight of 165 mts, practically all the places of interest can be spotted from the flyer, truly a landmark",,,
,,Singapore from the top,4,,A pleasant way to look at Singapore from a great height. The only down side is the smoke haze that blankets Singapore most days. (It comes from a nearby nation). For those with a fear of heights the Flyer is not a problem as it is spacious and very slow.,,,
,,lived in singapore and loved looking over the city,4,,we used to take most visitors to the flyer while we lived in singapore for 4 years we used to do the VIP where you get a pod to yourself and you get a drink and some nibbles.. its a fab way to see the city and i loved doing it of an evening as the lights are just mesmerising,,,
,,Great birds-eye views,4,,"An expensive activity, but worth it if you can bundle up with other activities. You don't notice the capsule turning, so even those with a fear of heights should not be concerned. There is a bench seat in the middle to sit. Takes a full 30 minutes.",,,
,,Great view of the city,3,,We went on a weekday so there was not queue at all and hence we got to go on the flyer straight away. It is an experience to go up to that height and I marvelled at the engineering behind it. Not very exiciting,,,
,,Another must do in Singapore!,5,,$33 SGD for a 30min ride that is well organised and educational. Great views from the wheel & good display before the ride!,,,
,,Great views from the Ferris wheel,3,,"I guess this is something you have to do while in Singapore. We did it at night and there are some great views to be had over the skyline.

The walk down there from the MRT stop in Sands hotel was pretty nice also.

Its a little expensive I would say, but a good way to spend an hour. I suggest going just before they close at 22.00",,,
,,Seeing the Singapore skyline,3,,"We opted for the dining package. The food was good, although choice very limited as it has to be put in place very rapidly! You get two trips round the wheel in about an hour. Great views of course, but a description or at least an annotated photo would have helped identify what you are seeing. Didn't feel this was best value. Probably better to just do the trip without the food.",,,
,,F1 GP Singapore - Race Day,5,,"With our tickets to Zone 1 on the race day we also had access to go on the Singapore Flyer - excellent view over the race course and the surrounding city, including Marina Bay Sands",,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Loved every minute of it , what a view and pictures you get while up there , it does not even feel like it is moving , defo try this one .",,,
,,Amazing view!,5,,make sure to book in your session during sunset time! its just amazing! we got in while sun was up and saw sunset till down!,,,
,,Breathtaking!,5,,"We've done this 3 times and ride shows us something we miss previously just takes our breath away.

Suggest you catch a cabin around 6.45pm and capture the wonderful skyline and views of the marina Bay Area as the sun sets and let nightfall transform the experience into a wonderful light display. Never fails to wow us and the kids just lap up the experience trying to name the buildings they spot. They've even given some building pet names like the 'Toberrone Experience' (as in the chocolate, see if you can spot it) Cameras a must.

Pram and kids friendly too.",,,
,,Views views views,4,,"Did this at dusk, and it is worth doing once. Outstanding views of the entire city and bay as night took over the island.",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,Took a ride on the flyer as was included in our F1 pass. Gave great views of GP2 cars around the track and helped to pick out other attractions around Singapore.,,,
,,Super views of the super city,5,,"We got a free ride as a part of the Grand Prix tickets we had purchased. We arrived early (as soon as it opened, which varies from day to day, so suggest check). Even on the GP weekend, it was very quiet, and we went straight to the front of the line, and had a capsule to ourselves.

The view improves and improves all the way up, and once over the top, you come down on (we thought) the better side. Views terrific, so definitely take a camera.

Please give me a 'Helpful' if my review has helped you - enjoy your flight!",,,
,,tallest wheel in the world.,4,,"a giant Ferris wheel. the tallest Ferris wheel in the world,built over a three-storey terminal building which houses shops, bars and restaurants, and offers broad views of the city centre.Each of the 28 air-conditioned capsules is capable of holding 28 passengers, and a complete rotation of the wheel takes about 30 minutes.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"The line was long but it was a great experience, the Ferris wheel doesn't stop so when you hop on you feel weird cause it's still moving. Same as when you hop off. You can have a romantic dinner in the singapore flyer. It does take a while but it was pretty good :-) it's best at night",,,
,,Good Experience,3,,I was a good experience for one time if you never been on any other flyer. You can see whole singapore from there but it's just 5 min thing. Although flyer goes for a 30 min ride.,,,
,,A must-do thing !,4,,"If you are in Singapore , you just have to go on the Flyer ! It can be a bit difficult to get to ( especially when the roads are closed for the F1 race ) but it's worth the effort and when you are up in the sky in one of the very large pods , the views are really tremendous.",,,
,,"Iconic, hi tech providing a great view",4,,"I avoided this icon until a grand daughter insisted. It is worth the visit, for the views alone. Access is on a par with Singapore high levels of efficiency, and there is an interesting display on how the wheel was constructed.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"A masterpiece of engineering worth visiting before a Flyer in Las Vegas soon takes over as the Worlds largest.
Plenty of time to take fantastic pictures Very good for people who may have difficulty with open air heights (as with Marina Sands Hotel which is higher)
Allow about 35 minutes on the Flyer and several options to eat on ground level Present your flyer ticket at Popeyes for a 1SGD ice cream!
If you have intentions to take a tour bus from here which we decided to do after our trip buy all tickets together to get a discount Saves a few bucks and worth it with a large party
The bus tours have a HQ stop here so you can do the bus trip before and after We did one complete trip and then went around again to drop off at our hotel",,,
,,"Worth Doing Once, but Only Once",3,,"I had only a few days in Singapore and figured this would have to be a 'must' while I was there. The view from the wheel itself is brilliant, although everything else about it is less impressive.

On the way in you go through an utterly daft museum which mixes occasional snippets of actually interesting (if you're technically inclined) information about the Flyer's construction, with vaguely profound sounding nonsense about circles and triangles. Further, although the view itself is brilliant, it lacks context for tourists. This was my first full day in the city and I was still working out what's what, so although I could admire the view, I had no idea what I was viewing. Some sort of guide besides the booklets advertising nearby restaurants would be nice.

Finally, they need to stop with all the aircraft terminology. Okay, you called your giant Ferris wheel a 'flyer' - very clever, but it doesn't make my carriage into a B747 or the shopping complex below into London Heathrow. Only a five year old whose never been on a plain (of which most visitors will be neither) would pretend otherwise and seeing it everywhere just felt asinine.

I'd say the Flyer is barely worth it's $33 price tag and no more. It's definitely not one of those experiences that's worth repeating but it is worth trying once, provided you speed away from the tourist trap around it post-haste afterwards.",,,
,,You have to see this to believe it,5,,"Architecture like no where else and the view at night time from the top was amazing. Very busy but we did not have to wait very long for an elevator, which was super fast.",,,
,,A 360 view of Singapore,4,,Been here and enjoy the view. The ride is just right to see the view 9f singapore. It is good to try it at night. City tours was the incharge of our group tour. Like to be back again in the future.,,,
,,Outstanding view of the city,5,,This was one of the few attractions we visited during out Singapore visit. The best part was that there was no waiting for the flyer. One could see the entire city at a glance.,,,
,,Brett & Lynn,4,,"A great view, clean environment in the flyer's cars. Great photographic opportunity easy to find we were lucky enough to have complimentary passes through Singapore Airlines.",,,
,,What a way to view Singapore,5,,"Went few weeks before Formula 1 so it was very quiet and only shared our capsule with one other person. Magnificent views over the harbour and the Formula 1 track and viewing stands being erected. Just beautiful. Make sure you get your photo taken by the guides before you enter, ours turned out great. Gift store was really boring, same things over and over",,,
,,Good Views of the City,4,,"Went up there during the Singapore GP. Best timing would be just before twilight, where you can get a good picture of the skyline during the sunset and later when the lights come on at the gardens by the bay. Also do check the weather report, You do not want to be up there on rainy days. Food wise, there are a rather decent variety of food as well. 1 rotation is about 30 minutes about there. Oh and the cabin is rather spacious as well.",,,
,,Stunning View,4,,"This attraction is not for people who has fear of heights. At first, I regret having said yes to my friends and joining them on this ride but I must admit though that the view is really stunning that eventually I enjoyed the ride. There's not much people when we got so we're lucky to have the car by ourselves.",,,
,,Directions?,4,,"The Sg Flyer is a confusing ordeal. Why would you name it the Singapore Flyer then have signage saying ""Flight Entry"" at the entry. Yes, you can see the link but when they have a flight simulator business in the on the same floor you could assume that it was the entry to the simulator and not the ferris wheel. Stupid.",,,
,,"Great views, very easy",4,,"Midday, during the week so no line up at all, we had a capsule to ourselves. The views are spectacular and as the wheel does turn so slowly its hard to feel it at all. I was expecting to pay more so thought it very reasonably priced. Its a bit of a walk to other nearby attractions at Marina Sands so you will need to plan for that if you are not driving or on a tour and want to go to shops or the Museum.",,,
,,Great fun,5,,Excellent view. We were there during F1 and were able to see a lot of the preparation. Get there early to avoid queues and crowds. We had a car to ourselves.,,,
,,360 Degree view of Singapore!,5,,"great experience, you get to see the best view of the city. Its worth considering the weather while planning. If the weather is bad then they may suspend the ride and no refund allowed.",,,
,,Bigger than the London Eye!,5,,"They can't help but say that at almost every opportunity! It's a fun thing to do, better on a clear day as you can see for miles.

I was there the week before the Singapore F1 GP so could see where they were doing all the track preparations and got an excellent view of the pits. I also opted for the Singapore Sling version so got a cocktail to drink on my way round.

Not bad value for money and does help you work out where things are!",,,
,,Fantastic View of Singapore from the Top,3,,"A ferris wheel ride where you can see the whole view of SIngapore from the top. For photoenthusiasts, this is a great way to take a Cityscape Shot. Also, I have never been a fan of ferris wheels because I get dizzy, but this one didn't make me feel dizzy in any way. The wheel was moving very slowly you won't even feel it's moving. I'll probably try it again at sunset or at night to get another cityscape shot. :)",,,
,,Slow rising up and going down,3,,We didn't ride this anymore and just stayed outside taking some pictures. Although we think it's a good place to relax because they also offer some meals for you to take inside the ride.,,,
,,Pretty good View.,4,,"This ""ferris Wheel"" gives you a good appreciation of the area. You can see the clever use of attractions. Take note of the river mouth where they are currently allowing a certain flow of water to enter the ocean but restrict the ocean water re entering. In a few years the river will be fresh water and hence they have solved their fresh water supply. Ingenious!.",,,
,,Great Ride,4,,What a view! We loved the ride and took lots of great photos. Definitely worth going up once. The pods were big and comfortable. We enjoyed the whole experience and had lunch in the hawker-like stalls after.,,,
,,Great free ride for Singapore F1 2013 Zone 1 ticket holders,5,,"On the Singapore F1 2013 race day we had a Zone 1 ticket which qualified us for a free ride on the Singapore flyer. There was a small queue to get on but this was managed efficiently, and we got onto the second capsule that arrived during our queue. The capsule was lovely and clean, with a smooth ride that moved almost imperceptibly. A reasonable number of people boarded each capsule so that there was a feeling of spaciousness and everyone could take pictures or look around without being in someone's way. The view is stunning and gives a person a bird's eye view of the magnificent city of Singapore, and is well worth the 30 min ride!",,,
,,you must go!,5,,"it's great, you can see all Singapore and enjoy a cocktail. in the night is the best time to go, all the city is lighted and the view is great.",,,
,,Fly in the sky of Singapore.,5,,"A giant wheel moving for 25 mins in 165 meters could make you shocked by the twinkle of the city at night.
The layout of the city was showed off in front of your eyes. You could watch the whole city from the top. This was an unforgettable experience in your life.
Just give it a try. It worths your time.",,,
,,one of thing must do in Singapore,5,,"im one of person who afraid of height. but its really worth to give it a try. it moves so slow and it let you enjoy the superb view from top, definitely safe for everybody and it takes only 30 minutes duration. best time to see it between 6 - 9 pm. you will see the singapore bling bling in 360 degree view. woohoooo !! singapore beneath your feet, spectacular view. it is bit expensive but really worth it. its a must try !",,,
,,A must when in Singapore,5,,"The views from the Flyer are amazing. Very relaxing slow trip. Takes about 20 minutes and the views are ""Over the Top""....It is a little bit pricey but I still would have hated to miss it. I understand you can even plan a catered meal and just keep going around during.",,,
,,Spend 30 Mins Locked in a Capsule. Fun!,3,,"We did not suffer any long queues but there was a lack of signage to point us to the capsule entrance. I enjoyed the exhibition area while queueing up. Took a cheesy pic against the green screen. Had a long, heart to heart conversation with my friend (who was visiting Singapore) as it was only us in the cabin. Great for bonding time :) Not worth the price though..",,,
,,Certainly worth the visit .,5,,"Great experience , the views are amazing and you get plenty of time to take some great pictures or videos.",,,
,,"Worth the cost, fun.",4,,"The largest ferris wheel in the world. The views are super, best at sunset or night. The ride lasts 30 minutes and goes so slow you don't really get any feeling of movement. It is not scary at all.",,,
,,Worth it for the views,5,,"Yes, it's not cheap at nearly a S$1 a minute, but well worth the expense just to view the city skyline from a different angle. If you have a choice go on a clear day.",,,
,,Great Experience,5,,"We are over in Singapore visiting friends for the Grand Prix and took a trip on the Flyer last night. For anyone who thinks they may be scared by the motion of this attraction, don't be. It takes 30 minutes and is very slow, giving you plenty of time for photos and admiring the amazing Singapore skyline. We took our trip at 7:30 so saw Singapore go from dusk to dark - stunning. Very big pods, plenty of room and well organised. A great way to see a panoramic view of this fabulous City.",,,
,,Amazing...,5,,Wonderful experience...must go place with family. The whole family enjoyed. View from top is breath taking. Do try for dinner in the evening.,,,
,,Great view but expensive,4,,A great way to get a perspective on the layout of the city. It is expensive as most things in Singapore are. I think the experience will vary greatly depending upon who else you have to share the cabin with,,,
,,awesome.,5,,Absolutely amazing. A little bit freaky at first walking around but once you get used to it its well worth it. The view at first is pretty alright but once you reach the top and start heading back down its amazing! All in all great experience and price not too bad in comparison to what were used to paying in Australia for similar things that are no where near as good!,,,
,,Superb views!,5,,It does exactly what it says on the tin. Amazing views of the spectacular skyline and we managed to go during the F1 which made it even more special. Good value at $33 for a foreign adult. A must do if you want to see the city from above. I'd recommend going when it's dark (after 7pm this time of year) as the lit up buildings look great!,,,
,,Nice way to see Singapore,3,,Singapore flyer is a unique way to see Singapore and is located near to the Marina Sands hotel and Gardens by the bay area.Each capsule can hold easily 10-15 persons and a round takes around 25 mins in which one can view Singapore and its sights and enjoy them,,,
,,Must try in Singapore,5,,"Its a must do whilst in Singapore. It gives awesome top view of the Singapore F1 circuit. Almost all of Singapore is visible. At 35$, its worth a watch.",,,
,,Best views of Singapore,4,,"We went on the Singapore Flyer at 22h00 at night and we were amazed by the breath taking views of the city at night. You hardly realise the giant wheel moving, and before you know if you are literally on top of the world. Being inside one of the big capsules you have a 360 degree view of the city. The flyer is also lit up at night with various colourful lights.",,,
,,Birds Eye View,5,,"Its a must to go to Singapore Flyer if you are in Singapore. The best time to go is when its just about sundown.. You can get both dusk and night views! Night views are spectacular where you can see the entire CBD well lit and it all looks fabulous! 30SGD they charge per rotaion which takeS around 25 mins to complete!

Go for it kids will love it!",,,
,,Wheely Fun!,4,,The facilities are well-kept and the staff are friendly. Simple ride but I had fun. Hope they can include some more visuals in each capsule to make it more lively. The price is not cheap too but it's worth a try.,,,
,,"Go, go and go!",5,,"I think it's a very nice attraction in Singapore. A bit expensive but you can take great pictures especially if you go at sunset.
After a nice technical introduction to the concepts and the construction of the wheel, you get on the flyer and can really enjoy your tour.
The reduced speed allows you to take many pictures, from all the possible corners, a very good visibility, clean glasses , comfortable seats and enough space to walk around.",,,
,,The huge wheel...,3,,"It is nice, but food was quite boring and cold. Each turn takes about 40 minutes, after second turn you get to a lounge for a desert. Quite boring and feels like no big deal, even though it is probably the highest wheel around...",,,
,,Great views but overpriced!,4,,"This is not a cheap ride at $SGD 33. The whole experience can be spoiled by being placed in a capsule with a screaming child and parents who do nothing about it and who also carry on talking on top note the whole trip and showed no interest in the view outside. What a shame some people show no respect to those around them. For $33 I really think you should be entitled to a capsule by yourselves!
We went on a Monday afternoon when it was very quiet and no waiting time.",,,
,,IT MOVES ON VERY SLOWLY AND ITS JUST WASTE OF MONEY,3,,"It just rotates for about 20 minutes and takes you to an altitude of 160 metres. For that you need to shed 33 dollars. Instead one should shed 20 dollars and visit the Marine Sands Bay-Skypark hotel which is more taller than the flyer. There is no much fun. If at all you still want to visit the Flyer, I recommend you to go around 17:30-18:00 hrs so that you can enjoy both the daylight and the night as well.",,,
,,Great experience.,5,,The best views in Singapore. Highly recommended. We enjoyed the flight and the views. It didn't even feel like we were moving. It took about half an hour to do a circuit. Just be aware that it gets closed when there is a lightening storm on.,,,
,,Wow! Loved every minute!,5,,"We went in the morning at about 9.30am so we were lucky enough to get our own capsule! The view is great! The experience is even better!
Do not miss out on coming here when you see Singapore!
We were told that the tickets would not be refunded if it starts storming.. I think that rule is silly & should be changed!",,,
,,Best views in the City,4,,"I've been on the Flyer twice now, once with family and once for a business event. Both were excellent experiences. I have been both times late in the evening and also just at dusk. I would highly recommend planning it so that you 'fly' just as the sun is setting. Beautiful colours in the sky and lovely to see",,,
,,Awesome,5,,"Great way to start the day, and also watch a storm rolling in, great views would of been better if it had been a clear day, but got loads of great photos, they were setting up for the F1 so building going on all around the area, getting a bit congested, but we enjoyed our morning, we also did the Hippo Duck, as its at the same location, that was great too, had lunch at the eating house too....",,,
,,Views are fantastic,5,,We did the Singapore Flyer at night. It was 33SD per person and the rotation took abt 25 mins - seamless and great views.,,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,"The flyer is a must do whilst in Singapore. We went yesterday (Monday) at about 3.45pm and there were no queues, so we were able to walk straight on and, despite the pods having a capacity of 28, there were only 7 of us in our pod. This enabled us to wander around the pod taking photographs throughout the full 360 degree views. Access to the flyer was hampered a little by the fenced off areas in preparation for the F1 at the weekend, however security guards were very helpful and we got the opportunity to take some shots on the track. There is a special seniors rate of 24 dollars, which made this particularly good value for us.",,,
,,What a great experience (especially at Night),4,,"If you want a great view of Singapore and to also get your bearings, then this is a great place to start your visit. With plenty of time during the ride( about half an hour for the full revolution) it gives you the chance to take in the sites of Singapore and also take some fantastic photos. But if you get the chance, try and take your ride at night for some truly fantastic night show of Singapore.",,,
,,Better than expected,5,,A must when in Singapore. Very substantial & safe scenic wheel with magnificent views of city and far away. Good value for money.,,,
,,Great value,4,,Great way to see the city. Great value for money and v well organised. Was very quiet when we were there too so had a pod to ourselves which was great,,,
,,"Romantic, and good value",5,,"We went on the Singapore Sling package for $69, after looking online. You get a souvenir glass, and a fabulous experience. The view across Singapore is amazing, and the service feels like VIP quality as the hostess takes you up a lift to the bar whilst you wait for your pod. I think this is an ideal birthday treat and a romantic opportunity to propose to someone. In our pod there was just us two, and another couple. After the flyer we walked along the river side, and crossed the bridge to the Mall, where we watched the light and water show鈥︹€? a perfect ending to a perfect Singapore flyer experience. One suggestion is VIP area鈥?.please get a coffee machine ;-)",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Have been on the Flyer twice now both times at night. The views are amazing and well worth the $33 to do the 30 min trip. Can get some great photo's with the 360 degree views. Definately worth doing.,,,
,,Wheely good night time views of the city,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is currently the largest observation wheel in the world. We went at night, so the views from up high were quite amazing, with the city all lit up. I took some amazing night time photos - the wheel moves slowly enough that you can rest your camera on the side of the window and get really good pictures.

It is a bit expensive at $33 as others were saying. But there is a small observation wheel museum that you pass through before getting to the wheel itself. Still, despite the cost, I think it was worth seeing.

There are many restaurants at the base of the wheel, so you could tie this activity in with a meal.",,,
,,Daytime Ride on the Flyer,5,,"We got the City Pass Deal and it had a specific time to go to the Flyer, the ride was breath taking and its a must do in Singapore, we got a special ride that came with the city pass, included special Pod with music and a signature drink which was delicious, it was just us and another couple in the pod, we can see the other pods were occupied by more people, our pod had 2 seating areas in the middle, but you will not want to sit down. A must do in Singapore, day or night.",,,
,,"Lights, Grandeur and Awe- Thats what this flight does to you!",4,,"Right from the neon light pathways to posing with the giant colour ball at the entrance, this place is a must do for a tourist in Singapore. The flight experience is worth it, though one can work a bit more on the duration(its only 30 minutes) but its a different experience. ( Tourists who've visited London Eye, shouldn't compare this one,just take it as it is from Singapore point of view)",,,
,,Seeing the sights.,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a great way to see the views of Singapore, including part if the F1 Grand Prix circuit. It takes 30 minutes to do one slow rotation. We went on a Friday morning and there were no queues at all, we just strolled straight into a pod with four other people. It was good, even in the rain. Seniors get reduced rates.",,,
,,magnificent views,5,,the Singapore flyer is a must the flyer takes half an hour to rotate once and the views are magnificent .we thought the flyer was good value for money at 拢16.00 each. There were no queues when we were there and the staff were very helpful and friendly.,,,
,,Must do in Singapore,5,,"Want a bird's eye view of Singapore? Experience a technical marvel? Just want to have cozy time with your partner? Want your kids to get thrilled? Singapore Flyer can fulfill all those wishes.

We actually sat through in amazement, clicked photos and watched gardens by the bay and merlion etc for almost half the ride. Then picked up a tourist map that showed all major locations and had great fun spotting them and talking to each other about each attraction. I'd recommend everyone to pick up the map (available in each flyer cabin) and have fun ""playing"" ""find the spot"" with your family / friends.

Overall, it's a unique experience, especially if you have never been to London Eye or anything similar. And if you are an engineer / interested in how things work, you'd certainly appreciate the pre-ride exhibition / gallery.",,,
,,Flying high,5,,My wife and I took a spin on the flyer on the 30th of August this year (a big deal since my wife doesn't like high places). This has got to be the best place to see the sights of Singapore and get your bearings before you tackle more of the great things Singapore has on offer. A great place to get some fab photo's and take in a lot of the city's iconic buildings in air conditioned comfort. We paid 33 dollars each for the experience (cheaper for kids and pensioners) but it is well worth it.,,,
,,Well worth it,4,,"We did visited the flyer on our first day, still tired and jet lagged! It was a great experience with fantastic panoramic views of Singapore and its wonderful (modern) architecture. Definitely worth doing!",,,
,,Must do!,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is really a must do! Amazing 360 degrees view on the entire city. Also a lot of sightseeing buses start from here. I recommend starting any Singapore tour from the flyer, take a bus and further explore the city. With $33 it is a bit pricy for a 30-minute ride, but the panorama is really amazing!",,,
,,Was a little cloudy - but still a great view.,4,,Not the easiest place to get to via Metro but signs mark the way ( we also had to walk round fencing for upcoming grad prix). Most of the tour buses will take you straight to the door and sell you discount prices but we did not know that until later. Went during the weekday and there was no lines!,,,
,,Oh-such beautiful going round !,5,,singapore flyer is wonderful with its capsules well designed. I understand this is the highest flyer in the world ! Really so ! When we were in the top of the flyer in a capsure we can see the panaromic view of Singapore and it is marvellous to enjoy that scene. We were also luck to see the next capsule meant for special occasions like birthday and marriage capsule ! Marriages made in this capsule - one cannot imagine. I wish in the next life i would like to marry my present wife in this capsule !,,,
,,When in Rome...,3,,Singapore flyer was nice way to view the entire country. Bit pricey but it was a decent way to get the view.,,,
,,A must do,5,,This is a must do when in Singapore I would recommend doing it at night as it is spectacular. It is worth the S$33,,,
,,Not the marina bay sands but still good,5,,When in Singapore is a must to go on the Singapore Flyer however the view is higher from the marina bay sands pool area. The flyer offers an alternative view of the marina and the surrounding area.,,,
,,Try this out!,5,,"Quite an awsome experience. Great way to see Singaore. If you can , complete the ""ride"" at dusk or at night for a spectacular view of Singapore city",,,
,,Recommend morning to avoid crowds,4,,"I recently took my family on an adventure in Singapore and carefully chose each location based on personal experience over the past 20 years and trusted recommendations.

The Singapore Flyer is a great way to enjoy a 360 degree view of the Singapore Marina and outlying areas. As with many great attractions in Singapore I highly recommend you go on a weekday morning when they open at 9am. This should assure you enjoy the experience with a minimum wait time.

This was my first time on the Singapore Flyer and arriving 9am Monday morning we had no lines and had a pod to ourselves. Seeing the lengthy pre-flight displays I realized that during peak times the wait could run to several hours and while the displays were interesting the long wait would not be.

If you bring a map or an iPad with maps its a great way to orient yourself for visiting other areas nearby. With no wait time the entire experience was about 1 hour and then we headed to Sentosa for the rest of the day.

For an even higher perspective vist the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark which is close by.

Most Singapore major attractions have online booking options to book and pay at a reduced rate. The confirmation(s) should be printed out with the bar codes which expedites the process even further while saving money on the booking.",,,
,,Nice view but boring,3,,Nice place to be if you are not in a hurry. This is for the slow and easy pace tour which is better visited at sunset to early night. You can walk to the nearby Marina sands hotel and gardens by the bay to continue your tour.,,,
,,Awesome view.,5,,"We were in a capsule with a family of four, and a group of four friends, so with my mom and I, a total of 10 passengers. The capsule was roomy, with enough room for everyone to stand, walk around and take pictures. Got a discounted rate too when we showed our SIA boarding pass.",,,
,,Not worth the money,3,,Quite a let down. Visit the Marina Bay Sands instead. It is quite expensive and a short boring 30 minutes. We went for our son and he was thoroughly bored.,,,
,,Spectacular Views of Singapore,5,,"This is our second flight on the flyer at night and it was spectacular. The vista has changed again since the last time as Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands has been added to the landscape. The cabins are very big and there is enough room to walk around if you are game! Seating is available in the center of the cabin for those who prefer to sit and enjoy the view.Magnificent views, quite breathtaking. One of the reasons we keep coming back to Singapore. The price is comparable with other attractions. If you are flying with Singapore Airlines take your boarding pass with you and receive a discount off your ticket price.",,,
,,Biggest in the world,5,,"We visited in the beginning of January. Very pleasant experience if you com[pare to the London Eye. No ques, no hussle and a really nice experience",,,
,,BREATHTAKING,5,,We decided to take a ride on the flyer at dusk and were rewarded with the most awesome experience of watching the sun set over the city. Everyone visiting Singapore should visit this attraction,,,
,,Not a must see,3,,"Visited here with 16 month old daughter and husband. We went around 7PM and this worked out wonderfully. We were able to see the city in the light but by the time we had made it to the top it was dark and we were able to see everything lit up. We got lucky and only had 4 other people in our cabin so we were really able to enjoy the views and take lots of pictures and move about freely. If it was crowded I couldn't imagine having our toddler there or being able to really enjoy it, especially for the price. I recommend buying your tickets ahead of time, either on your phone or at home. They give you a 10% discount and its much more convenient because you can go right to the entrance with your phone. If you have a stroller, be prepared to go out of your way to get it back. You have to leave it at the entrance and loop back around after you exit to get it again. I understand why I couldn't take it with me but there has to be a more efficient way than making me go downstairs, only to go back upstairs on the other side to retrieve my belongings. It was neat but if you've see the city from the viewing deck at MBS you could probably skip this extra expense.",,,
,,Fly High,4,,"Very safe and well worth the trip, I suffer from fear of heights, being enclosed softened the fear, in true Singapore style I was never in danger, I just need to reassure myself only a few times.",,,
,,Nice view at night,3,,Nice although a little expensive and it's a great thing to do at night for the cityscape. Windows could be cleaned more often though. The line moves quick and personnel is efficient.,,,
,,Worth the spin,5,,"We arrived, purchased our tickets, hopped on board and had our own cabin but it absolutely bucketed down and we didn't see a thing.

I mentioned this and they reissued our tickets and we went again the next day. It was a fine day and the experience was awesome. Great way to see Singapore's skyline.

Highly recommend.",,,
,,Worth a Ride,5,,"OK, similar to the London Eye, but slightly bigger and different views!! Cost approx 拢16.50 [拢37 for family ticket] Amazing views of Singapore skyline. Short trip on the MRT Underground takes you to the Gardens At The Bay.",,,
,,Great view,5,,This is like the one in London. Gives a great view of city. Lines were short. Loved Singapore and the was a great way of getting an overview.,,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,Would recommend spending a little extra for the Singapore Sling flight as you get a themed cabin with just a few of you. You also get a Singapore Sling and free glass. The best time is at sunset!,,,
,,View of the City,4,,"It was worth the 20+ minute ride. Can see whole Singapore and even some parts of Indonesia. We took the ride around 5pm, the weather was good and sky was clear. So manage to capture nice shots.",,,
,,OK ish,4,,"It's just like any other flyer / eye, only this one's slightly pricey.but I noticed something different, there are catering capsules, I guess you have to finish your meal before the spin ends, which is roughly 40 minutes.",,,
,,45 mins on awesome city view,5,,"to choose between the view from the top of marina bay sands hotel or the flyer depends on your taste.

you may see the city lights during the night for $20 from the marina bay sands hotel. since the flyer is open to normal tour till 6pm only. after than their special tour (or flight) starts.

There a quiet a few ticket options on packages you may choose the duck tour or the river cruise both are good. but river cruise is longer and pleasant. But you will miss riding the duck.",,,
,,Awesome Flyer,4,,"My daughter really love this attraction. It's like a dream come true for her, riding a giant flyer. The view from the top is awesome, good for taking photos.. but I don't feel comfortable because of the glass capsule. Our daughter just can't stop moving around and I'm afraid that she might break something, lol.

Anyway, I really reccomend this as the a must visit attraction",,,
,,Must Go !!!,5,,"Its worlds tallest wheel ...
It surpassed London Eye which was the world's tallest wheel.
Great going Singapore !!!
Two options are available:
1. Take a simple ride. One rotation takes about 50 mins. Enjoy the breath taking view and get out.
2. Go for lunch/dinner where you will be served on the go .. 2 rotations (approx 100 mins to complete the food ...",,,
,,Worth it for the view,4,,I would do this if you want to spend some quiet time and relax. We were also lucky enough to view the grand prix track taking shape which added some intrigue.,,,
,,great view,5,,This is the biggest ferris wheel in the world. I liked it as it provided audio guides that allowed us to have the optimal view of Singapore's skyline. It also spoke of the history of Singapore and the vision of Lee Kuan Yew. Go around 5pm.,,,
,,Fantastic,5,,Awesome views of the city. The capsule is spacious and there were only 8 of us in it. This a definite must do.,,,
,,Rain did not stop play,4,,"This experience is much like the london eye. It rained while we were on board, but we still saw lots. The pit lane for the grand Prix was just below us. Lots of info on the building of the wheel. We went in the day cos we had other stuff to do in the evening. We ate in the mock up street afterward.",,,
,,Ferris Wheel Knock-off,3,,"If you've ever been on a ferris-wheel, this is just a giant version of that. On the one hand, the ability to see Singapore from the air is super cool, but on the other hand, the fee to participate is exorbitant. Another plus is that there are benches to sit and the pods are air conditioned, so if you need to escape the heat, maybe this attraction is worth the price.",,,
,,Flyer,3,,"This is my 3rd time to ride the flyer, with a year in between each visit. There are 3 nice things to see from on top. The area along The Pitstop, The Gardens by the Bay, and The Marina Bay. I prefer to go at night, Singapore's night lights are the best. (Not that camera friendly though). Its a romantic ride (prefer to have the flyer exclusive). However, its not that great when you are group together with a loud bunch.",,,
,,A reasonable experience and not too costly!,4,,"Views aplenty in these air conditioned capsules. Very roomy and easy to walk around in and take photos/movies. It doesn't stop so getting off is an experience too, strangely a wee bit harder than getting on, which was easy peasy!",,,
,,Good view of Singapore,5,,"It is great seeing all the tall buildings, the Mariana Bay Sands and the Malacca Straight... a great way to view Singapore Panoramically.",,,
,,OKish,3,,"One of a must in Singapore if you have time. If you're on a tight schedule just go to MBS instead you wont miss out much at all. The flyer takes around 30 mins to complete a turn, but only one side of the flyer, the downward turn, can provide you with what you wanted to see: the marina bay. Pretty much you get to see it for 10 mins and its always moving. IF you're lucky you wont get pushed away by the crowds in your cabin and can take some decent photos. Otherwise just go to MBS; better view, more space, constant height. The rest of the stuff exhibited there are not really interesting at all, you'll pretty much skip all of them just to get on the ferris. The price was 33SGD.",,,
,,Amazing bird's eye view and instant snapshot of Singapore!,5,,"Great overall experience. My husband and I did this on day 1 and the views are awe inspiring. The venue is run very efficient, clean and well set out. Lots of information before ride which takes 30 minutes. Absolutely worth every minute.",,,
,,"""Singapore from a HIGH""",4,,The famous Singapore flyer gives a nice view of the city from a height. The F1 racing track rather looks amazing from that height. The staff and their service is pretty well organized.,,,
,,a good attraction to view Singapore in a different perspective,5,,"From this place you can enjoy all Singapore view.. the buildings, the sky scrappers up to the ocean.. Recommended to ride in the evening",,,
,,must see once in a life time.I enjoyed a lot there and i wiil be happy to go there once again.,5,,"I went there in octber2012 along with my wife and another couple.there are so things to see in singapore, but i like the most is singapore flyer . It is just like RAMDOLI of indian minabazars.but that flyer is worlds largest,highest wheel.better to go there in evening time.",,,
,,A good ride,3,,"The Singapore flyer was good. The cabin was comfortable and they dont put too many people in which makes it easier to walk about and take photos without having other people in the shot.
The views over the bay was and the city are great. You have to do it once.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,3,,"I went to Singapore flyer a couple of times , the great thing is the scenery and I took many photo. There is many carpark lots available and it is near to Sand Casino.",,,
,,Definitely a birds eye view!,5,,"We loved seeing beautiful Singpore from above! It was most enjoyable to share the car with others and hear of their experiences, recommendations of restaurants and hear about their lives!",,,
,,Great view a bit pricey,4,,Went early before the lines get long bring your camera the view over Singapore is great over look the entire river and bay,,,
,,singapore flyer,5,,"when visiting singapore ,we had a fantastic ride on the flyer ,seeing all over the marine bay sands area ,fabulous.",,,
,,Great Flyer,5,,Excellent view and photo opportunities from the Singapore Flyer especially watching the preparations for the Formula One Gran Prix in a couple of weeks.,,,
,,Birds Eye View of Singapore,4,,"The tallest ferris wheel in the world (higher than London Eye), this is one of the best places to see Singapore from a height. It can be beaten or matched only by 1-Altitude or Marina Bay Sands observation deck.

It gives a 30 minute ride that takes you in a slow moving capsule in a clock wise rotational pattern. The wheel never stops moving, so you get in and get out in a moving wheel.

The views are absolutely breathtaking, you can see the docked ships behind marina sands bay as well as the merlion park (lion statue), marina bay sands and most of the other landmarks in the city that stand tall.

Most of the city hop on and hop off tours start from here, so you can do the wheel + book a city tour in the same building. At the time I went, Funvee tours had a discount on the flyer tickets if you book city tours with them - so make sure you visit the tour operators before you visit the flyer.

Overall a must do when in Singapore. Fees are 33 SGD per person. The food court has some nice authentic chinese food, which is value for money and a must try.",,,
,,Absolutely brilliant - definitley recommend!,5,,"We loved the Singapore flyer, and in a typical efficient Singapore manner, they had us ushered through quite quickly. It is quite slow, very large and stable, so if you are scared of heights, you should be ok. The views are amazing. We went during the day, but a tour guide later told us he recommended around 7pm as you got to see the day, the sunset and part of the night. Totally recommend. Great way to see the city!",,,
,,Great Attraction,5,,Excellent views of the Marina and city. Even better to go during the Singapore Grand Prix as entry is free.,,,
,,On top of the world,5,,"Most unbelievable views of Singapore, you can see the whole place and more from the top. Great experience, a must do when visiting Singapore",,,
,,Great view,4,,"The best time to go on the flyer is at sundown,great view over Singapore and marina bay,and if you are interested in Grand Prix it's a nice view over the pit lane",,,
,,Magnificent views of Singapore,5,,We loved the flyer - it was a great introduction to the Singapore and offered fantastic views of this beautiful and innovative city.,,,
,,Better than the London flyer,5,,"Slowly circulating ,very safe.it give view of Singapore from all angles.perfect photo sites.i recommend to go twice ,once during day time and the other at night.",,,
,,Great view of the lion city,4,,"Up to the sky with the flyer. It provides a great view of the city, i would recommend going at night as the view will be alot better with all the buildings lighted up.",,,
,,Wonderful views,4,,"The Flyer is a highly recommended visit whilst in Singapore. The views of the harbour, marina, gardens by the sea and back over the mass of beautiful tall buildings is worth every cent and it is not a hugely expensive exercise. Just do it!",,,
,,great views!!,4,,"Got this tour from the 2-day i-venture card. It's just near the marina bay so it's easy to go to. Also a must see if you only have a limited time in Singapore, where you can practically see everything in Singapore..",,,
,,Family holiday,5,,"Even though scared of heights I loved the Singapore flyer, great view and even if raining you get a clear view of the city and surroundings. Plenty of room to move in each carriage and sit down.",,,
,,Superb,5,,fantastic view and good experience. My kids had an awesome time and love it in my every visit.people travelling to singapore it is must to go an experience Singapore flyer.,,,
,,Its a one time experience,4,,"Its nice but not that great. Its just for an experience. if you have never tried london eye, you can try this, its just the flyer which will revolve a full circle and you would be able to see singapore from a birds eye.

I didnt find this too great but just another tick in my itineary for the places i have seen in singapore.",,,
,,What a View!,5,,Awwww you see the Whole Singapore from a one ride! It's good You go there in the day time! I wish I have taken dinner in the flyer! It was awesome!,,,
,,Worth a go,4,,Wasn't too expensive and it was a good view. The glass had some smudges on it though which was a shame. I felt with the amount of capsules coming around and lack of patrons me and my girlfriend could have had one to ourselves but they got us in one with a bunch of other people.,,,
,,a bird's eye view,5,,"Singapore is a city state that has a lot to offer anyone. from the tourist who walks with a book looking for all that he can cram in a single visit, to the leisurely traveller soaking in anything that comes by, all leave with a great experience. the zoo, the esplanade, the sentosa island resort, the universal studios are all for the best part enjoyable. It's the flyer takes you to a new high, literally! the slow trip that spins you to the bay sands level of the the top floors and the view of the horticulture museum, the botanical gardens, the other sights from the air, make for great viewing. Whether you are a hard boiled egg or are a little child you will have a great time. Guaranteed. the souvenir shop makes sure you take back some good reminders too.!",,,
,,360 View of Kallang River,4,,"Overlooking Kallang River is a 360 degree slow moving enclosed giant ferris wheel where a panorama view of Singapore is twenty minutes for SGD $30.00. Tourist trap indeed but I thought it was fair to middlin' and a keepsake triangle shape ""In-Flight Compass"" unfolds to become a circular panorama map is included... big woo. The circular panorama map of Singapore is, however, a nice keepsake souvenir. From my 2010 Singaporean adventure there is a audio guide for various languages to describe the various scenes which is also included. Seats are readily available for those who fear heights. Private parties are available which includes dinner and drinks atop of Earth's giant observation ferris wheel.

Not worth SGD $30.00 for the hike atop a giant ferris wheel when there are iconic places actually worth physically going rather than viewing from above. This experience only feeds the illusion not the reality of being at a point of interest when one can actually be there. Supposedly, Singapore Flyer carries the claim as the ""largest observation ferris wheel"" ... big woo.",,,
,,Great,5,,The views over Singapore from the flyer are fantastic. We were in a pod with only two other people and so could move around to get better views.,,,
,,Better than London!,5,,"This, of course, is the world's biggest observation wheel. We caught a fabulous view of the city and the map they supply is excellent and very easy to understand. The best bit, though, is that each party has it's own pod. Not like London where they just herd you in. It was really special but even more special just to be the 5 of us. We did it in the day time so next time we'll have to do it at dusk. We certainly will do it again!",,,
,,"Excellent Views, Go around 4-5 p.m. !!!",5,,"This is really one of the best attractions not to be missed while visiting singapore.. The best time to visit this awesome wheel is around 4 to 5 pm.. the cost is about 33 SGDs per head and if you have taken the famous ""Duck tours"" you dont have to pay extra for this wonderful ride.. Because of the tropical temperature of singapore, this is better as an attraction during the day time.. You can however enjoy the night views of singapore from Marina Bay Sands Hotel's roof top skywalk as well.. So prefer this by this evening time when there is not much Sunlight and its not too hot !!! The ride consists of one circle (takes about 35 mins) to go around.. The mall/ shopping center at the base of this flyer does not appeals to be much of as an attraction unless you have kids who may enjoy games centre.. Dont waste a lot of time at the base as birds eye view of Singapore CBD awaits the awesome ride..",,,
,,Great City Night View,4,,We went around 8pm and the city night view was fantastic. Overlooking the MBS and the Garden Bay. The ride lasted about 30mins and we had 8 person in our capsule. I was told we could have a chance to see the fireworks on National Day which was a week before.,,,
,,Another stunning view,5,,A bit off the beaten track to get to and another expensive ride but we went up as the sun was setting and we viewed Singapore as all the lights came on. A lovely sight!,,,
,,Fantastic Views,4,,"I went in the London Eye in June so had to try out the Singapore Flyer. It was definitely worth it, such great views of the Singapore skyline and surrounding areas.",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,"Got a free experience due to booking a Singapore Airlines stopover package. Even if I had to pay full price it would still be worthwhile experiencing the ride.
Great views of the Singapore skyline. Queue moved along smoothly, so only had to wait 10-15 minutes to get on the ride",,,
,,Could use a good clean,3,,Found this a little boring and could not take any decent photos as the glass walls were smudge with hand and forehead prints. The view from Skypark was much better.,,,
,,Fantastic views!,5,,"You cannot visit Singapore and not to on the Singapore Flyer. It is 42 stories high, making it the tallest ferris wheel in the world. Views of the city and harbour are breathtaking!",,,
,,Porperty of Singapour,5,,You shoudn't miss to ride Singapour Flyer inf you go there. You could see the bewst views of Singapour from there. I would ride it again if i would be back there .,,,
,,Great view of Singapore,5,,"Loved out trip on the Flyer, we chose to go at night to see the marina all lit up and it was so worth it. Would defiantly recommend this experience to anyone visiting!",,,
,,Only if you are dining,3,,"We actually didn't visit the Flyer, because we saw that it is less high than the Marina Bay Sands, so we've chosen the Skypark at Marina Bay Sands to get the best views on the city.

The ride takes 20-30 minutes in a closed capsule, so I think it's really a waste of time if you are only up for the views.

The situation is different though if you opt for the dining or drinking package. Then of course it's a great way to spend some time with the loved one!",,,
,,Great way to view Singapore's Marina,5,,"I've been on the London Eye and experienced hour-long queues. Then I went to Singapore and walked straight onto a comfortable airconditioned bubble and saw some great views of Singapore, particularly the Marina Bay and harbour. There's a nice little interactive information area before you board which describes how it's been built, how safe it is, and that of course it's the biggest in the world. I went with the family as part of the Singapore Pass - well worth googling as you save a fortune, and get to ride in a duck boat IN the Marina Bay as part of the deal, and then later on an open top bus around it.",,,
,,Amazing Singapore by night,4,,"The Singapore flyer is a must on a tourist's list. It gave us the opportunity to explore Singapore's mystic night beauty. The awesome modern architecture of Singapore is superbly viewed through it. We got a nice discount on our tickets too which was 25S$, to the originally cost of 33S$ /adult. We reached there via bus and came back to our hotel via MRT.",,,
,,Worth the cost.,4,,"We went at lunchtime so were lucky to avoid the queues & get a car to ourselves. Spectacular views, though the background musak was annoying & unnecessary. You are harangued into having your photo taken before going on & then accosted to buy it when you get off, we didn't even bother looking as we knew the price would be expensive. The souvenir shop at the end was disappointing, mostly tacky junk, we just bought a couple of postcards at $1 each. Beware the icecream stall nearby, very tempting but very expensive.",,,
,,Bigger than the London Eye,4,,"This was our first stop in Singapore as it gave us an idea of the expanse of the city, and where we would like to visit during our stay. We could clearly see paths around the Marina which were not so clear on maps, and the location in relation to our hotel. Such a lot to see.",,,
,,Good views of Singapore,4,,Broken down the day we were there and had to wait 90 minutes for it to be fixed. Queues weren't too bad. Thankfully options nearby for food and drinks. Queue for taxis about as long as for the singapore flyer.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,A fantastic ride and the views from the top are fantastic. There is a lot of room to move about in the cars and the queues were not that bad.,,,
,,Amazing view,4,,"We decided to take a ride to see beautiful Singapore from the above. The first surprise was with the tickets as we had 20% discount by presenting evidence (boarding pass) we flew with Singapore Air. The history of construction is quite interesting; hard to believe how massive and technologically advanced this site is. Cabin was clean and, it appears, covered by anti-glare film... So, all pictures were very nice. It would be good to have more audio-guide while on the ride; the paper flyer is useful, but it is hard to navigate around and know at which point you would have a best view for a particular place. Also, there were only 4 people in our cabin. I guess more than 10 people would make cabin crowded.
So, it makes sense to go there once and enjoy the ride",,,
,,Good but expensive,4,,Only good if you are first time to SG and want to enjoy a overview of the great city view. Is smaller than the London one and during day time is not so many people so you might have a chance to ride on your own.,,,
,,Ride above Singapore,5,,"How can you not like this adventure in what is a truly fascinating multi-cultural city. I just love Singapore, it is clean, safe and full of so many wonderful places to visit. The public transport is cheap, clean, punctual and again very safe.",,,
,,$33 or Bring your Singapore Airline Boarding Pass for 20% Discount,4,,"The ride is approximately 30 mins and I would highly recommend this ride. There is also a dining option which would be pretty cool but I'm not sure how much this cost. In comparison to other attractions, the queuing length is reasonable but still expect to wait for 15 mins in the queue at the least!",,,
,,Lovely views of city,5,,"We were in Singapore for a unplanned trip so decided to do the flyer to see Singapore and really enjoyed it. Cracking views of the F1 track and lovely views of the city.

Capsules were clean, not alot of queuing and the area around the flyer was nice with shops and restaurants.",,,
,,Great View!,5,,The view on the Singapore Flyer was simply breath taking! Only drawback was it got a little distracting at the very top.,,,
,,Great way to see Singapore from above.,4,,"Great way to see the skyline and harbor of Singapore. The price is a little high, but it is worth it to try once. There were no crowds and it was easy to get on, although the entrance was hard to find. The windows could have been cleaner however.",,,
,,Must go,5,,"It is a sort of welcome to all the tourist who comes for the first time in Singapore. My travel agent booked it for me just after the early morning arrival, as I was not too sure if my hotel people would allow me to do a early check-in, which infact they did. As it was my first time, everything was new, as soon as you reach, you see two beautiful machines (ferrari & lamborghini) parked outsie for a ride of 30 mins. at $250.

The Singapore eye gives you a great view of the city and the F1 track, in a complete half an hour circle. The view is amazing, a good experience for the first timers and people who have a late check-in, can utilize their time here, as it takes max 1 hour.",,,
,,Worth seeing but expensive,3,,"We visited the Singapore Flyer on our first evening in Singapore. It was already dark and we had a great view if the city at night. It was a great kick-off for our trip. Unfortunately, it is expensive which can discourage familes from using it.",,,
,,Spectacular view....,4,,A good way to see the city while being up there......one would see the marina bay sands hotel...the F1 racing track ...Merlion and a 360view of the entire city which is spectacular...must take a good camera and something to drink while being up there....a one time thing to do ...,,,
,,excellent,5,,we can see the almost Singapore city from this flyer.full safety measures taken by the organizers.it moves very slowly .the cost around 300 Singapore dollars.one of the sweet memory in my life with the flyer.,,,
,,Marina Bay & the Singapore Flyer,5,,"This is really my island in the sun, and a wonderful place to see and experience the wonders of nature at Marina Bay , with the spectacular view of the Singapore Flyer . I cycle or walk through the Garden of the bay and see the many man made lakes, and botanical plants from all over the world .
At night , the view from the 1 Fullerton is indeed spectacular , as one sits down with friends in the al fresco environment, and see the beautiful night scene of bum boats plying along the Bay , and in the back ground the illuminated Singapore Flyer, which gives a beautiful picture of Singapore by night.
The Palm Beach Restaurant serves first class dishes of the island favorite dish of Chilly crabs, and other delicacies, while for fifteen minutes from 8-8.15pm , one can witness the spectacular laser show . Many other restaurants serve food and refreshments.",,,
,,Not to be missed !,5,,"Although I've been in Singapore, at least twice, after its construction, only this time is that I decided to travel in the Singapore Flyer and it was a wise decision.
The views of Marina Bay and the Singapore River are truly spectaculars. If you can, make the trip at night and then you can enjoy all the skyscrapers lit up.
Impressive and unforgettable.",,,
,,Coulda woulda shoulda been good - it wasn't,3,,"One of our taxi drivers told us we would enjoy the flyer immensely - he pointed out that it travels so slowly you don't even know you are moving. We should have just walked away ...

It was a short wait to get into a pod and there were two other families with us. One family had a 2 year old and a baby, they were charming. The other family was not.

The problem was a terrible two's. Over-indulged by her parents and older siblings, she clearly had her own agenda which included running around the pod screaming and crashing into other people and pushing her way through. I did remonstrate with the mother but she either did not understand English, or more likely, was just unable to control her dreadful child. The family feebly attempted to reign her in but she was having none of it which prompted several loud tantrums.

Needless to say the taxi drivers comments of not feeling you were moving came back to haunt us. If only we could have moved at warp speed and escaped from this family from hell...

Visually, it was stunning. I'm a big F1 fan and it was great looking down on the set up for the forthcoming grand prix. I can't remember much of what else we saw as my memories are tortured by the offspring of Beelzebub. Believe me, it was such a relief to get off at the end.

Probably worth a visit, but do vet who is in front of you before you get on the pod !!",,,
,,I wouldn't recommend it.,3,,"Yes, you get a great view of the city & the F1 track but I don't think it's worth the money. We went at sunset which was nice. I wouldn't recommend it.",,,
,,Fun,5,,We booked for a 4-course dinner on the flyer. Not cheap but the experience was delightful. You choose food and drinks prior to going and then there is a waiter who looks after you whilst you enjoy the view.,,,
,,A wonderful time,5,,We were given the meal experience as a wedding present. You are greeted at the reception area. Then you are taken onto another floor where you choose your drinks. Then you get to q jump. The food is good and the view is amazing. We choose to do the last meal in the evening. I highly recommend this.,,,
,,Not bad,3,,"The Flyer is ultimately let down by what you can see when you're on it - there's only so many times you can stare at the Marina Bay Sands and the bay itself.

There were no queues, we walked straight on. The staff member had the decency to usher us past a group of loud children and onto a pod with an Australian couple. So there were just 4 of us in a pod which allowed us all to move around with ease.

There is the usual 'pre flight' experience as to how it works and was built, and usual 'post flight' experience of being ushered through the gift shop.

We had complimentary tickets as part of a Singapore Airlines stopover holiday. Not sure I would think I would have got value for money if I'd had to pay.",,,
,,Bittersweet experience,3,,"This was a bittersweet experience. The view is unique no doubt. But, the cabin we got in was dirty. It even had a mild urine odour and the windows were not clean at all. Smudged, and apparently not cleaned in some while. A real shame considering the price (33 $) and the potential of such an attraction. To make it even worse the condense on the windows ( cool inside hot outside) gave us a hard time to enjoy the view. We got in around 2100 hrs. Worth while but not again during daytime.. we would have done a daytrip if it was cleaner.",,,
,,Great View,5,,We really enjoyed our ride on the Flyer. You could hardly tell that you were moving through the air. It felt like you were looking down from a tall building. Great 360 degree views of Singapore.,,,
,,A good overview of Singapore,3,,"Its good to see the city from here and you get very good views of the F1 track if you are a fan, but th skypark is more unusual if you are after the view and can deal with the height.",,,
,,Spectacular 360 degree views,5,,"Pros:
-I got a complimentary pass from SIA, as I was stopping over in Singapore.
-There's an interactive tunnel with exhibits and photos of famous visitors (included boxer Manny Pacquiao and a Miss Universe) en route to the capsules.
-Quiet, air-conditioned capsule with benches for seating
-Smooth movement
-Spectacular views
-Free information leaflet guide explains what you are seeing
-Numerous restaurants and bars in the two levels beneath the Flyer including Subway. There's also a 7Eleven convenience store.

Cons:
-Gift shop a bit bare of goods for sale",,,
,,Great views,4,,"I think this is a good tourist attraction. Good views when you are at the highest point. My children loves it.
My reservation is on the food. Difficult to make sure there's halal food thus we had to buy the kaya toast from a stall near the escalator on the same floor as the ticketing booth. The staff do not smile at all. But probably because of the long hours work.
Can try for the 6D ride in front of the entrance to the Spore flyer but I would suggest do not try this ride after you have gone on the 4D Transformers ride at USS. Anti Climax!",,,
,,Truly deserves to be called the largest wheel in the world,5,,"If I'm not mistaken, the wheel makes a complete rotation for half hour. Excellent views of the city. Despite the fact that there is unbearable hot outside, inside the cabin is pretty cool.",,,
,,dont miss it,5,,"grt place to see singapore sky line.. but make sure u go between 7;30 to 8;30, so that you can view laser and fire show from there.. you can see whole singapore sky line..",,,
,,Brilliant!,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a fantastic experience from start to finish. We arrived at about 10.30am on a weekday, were directed to the ticket booth, no queues to purchase our tickets, $99 SGD for 2 adults and 2 children. So far so good. The entrance to the Flyer has changed since we last visited, there are now plenty of hands-on activities for the children which they really enjoyed. It wasn't busy so we took plenty of time here before we boarded the Flyer. There was no queue to board the Flyer and we walked straight into a pod with 4 other people. It takes about 30 minutes and as it was a clear day, the views were amazing. You get a great view of the F1 pits at the start and the Marina Bay Sands hotel is also impressive. There was plenty of room to move around the pod and take in the different views. After the ride, we went to the Food Court underneath the Flyer which was excellent and definitely worth a visit. They have a good selection of different cuisines and there's something for everyone, even fussy children! Would definitely visit the Flyer again and would recommend this attraction at the start of your visit.",,,
,,okay okay,3,,"if you are planning to visit skypark at marina bay sands, can skip it. as the skypark is at much more height that flyer and the ticket for both the things is same.",,,
,,A must see in Singapore!,4,,"A friend and I were in Singapore for 1 day and knew that this was a must see while we were in town.

Getting there: It was pretty easy from our hotel, we hopped on a bus and made it there pretty easily. I'm certain most cabs will know where it is, and there is a metro stop right near it as well. So super convienent.

Ticketing: No line, we walked up and bought out tickets. We did however look online and they were offering 10% off if you booked online- unfortunately our phones weren't working that well, so we didn't want to risk it! But if you want to book ahead and print confirmations at home, why not!

The experience: Get up the escalator and you go through a holding pattern where there are things to explore, cool gizmos for the kids to play with etc. I'm sure these are much more helpful when there is a long line to get on. Luckily it was a weekday, and there was NO line! :)

We waited all of 2 minutes for a capsule to become available and we were in. Once you get in, everyone settles into a seat and starts setting up their cameras. GRAB A MAP, located in the cabin. It has TONS of information including, ""hey what's that over there?"" it'll answer all of those questions! It was too bad we found it too late!

The ride is pretty long, I didn't time it, but we ended up getting a great view of the city right before sunset, and that was pretty awesome!

Afterwards, lots of shops, and restaurants- both a local food area and more international restaurants to eat at.

Would I go again?: Absolutely! And I would recommend it to anyone in the area who wants to see the city!",,,
,,Singapore flyer,3,,"In my opinion this is just ok , it is nice view , if u haven't seen any tall building in the world nd not visited top then it is ok to visit , for me nd family it was most blaring , I would rate it just ok .mrt station is 5 min walk , but hot weather it is to much , go in even only , day view is blaring .",,,
,,A must do,4,,"Great way to see the layout of Singapore. Clear day best. Only 30 minutes, but plenty of interesting information about the building of the flyer as you travel up to the loading deck",,,
,,Nice views from the world's largest wheel,4,,"Great views of Singapore. Can do deals with a champers ""flight"" too and other specials. I have been on it both day & night and both are great. Nice to do when people are visiting!",,,
,,"Do it early in your stay, you wont regret it.",4,,"This was my second time, and i still enjoyed it. Gives you a good idea of where things are in singapore.",,,
,,Great again and again,5,,Been on this ride three times in four years. Kids love it. View is gorgeous. Afterwords the little forest in the middle of the mall is excellent. And the food court has great variety at good value. Then the walk around is fabulous.,,,
,,Breathtaking views,4,,"While working at the Singapore Grand Prix I took the opportunity to have a trip on the Singapore Flyer, which proudly claims the accolade of highest observation wheel in the world. It goes without saying that the views are spectacular, and as I went up at night, the city was shown in arguably its most impressive light. Having said that, if I have the opportunity to visit again then I will try to go on the flyer during daylight, when it would be easier to identify the sights and appreciate the city in full colour.",,,
,,Great views. So clean,5,,"Fantastic aerial views of Singapore especially sea views, F1 track and ball park surrounded by water. Must visit",,,
,,Fear of Heights?,5,,"Fantastic way to see a birds eye view of Singapore at a nice easy pace, even when you do have a fear of heights. We went just before sunset and the views of the setting sun truly enhanced the incredible scenery that unfolds the further up the Flyer takes you.",,,
,,Ok but,4,,"Probably now unimpressed by travelling on these things but, it was at night, views were spectacular and it did give us ideas of buildings, places we should go and see. If you are into F1 then just by there you can stand on the start line.....",,,
,,A must visit place,5,,Another alternative to view Singapore city from an aerial view. Fantastic view from a top. Don't miss the Flight Experience situated at the 2nd Floor.,,,
,,"Magnificent views, great ""flight""",5,,"I was skeptical, but the Flight Experience / Ferris Wheel was a lovely interlude (air conditioning was wonderful, too). Exquisite views of SIngamore and surroundings. The walk up to the ""flight"" is filled with interesting displays, including information on the engineering of the ferris wheel. Informative. Especially like the comparison with other similar, large Ferris Wheels now dotting various cities, especially in Asia (plus London).",,,
,,Pricey but good overall,4,,"The wheel is an excellent way to see an overview of the sights of Singapore and is a fun experience. The price is a little high, but it is worth it to try once.",,,
,,Great Way to see the City,4,,"Similar to the London Eye but even bigger. We walked around Marina Bay to Lia Aisah, it took us 30 minutes but was a very nice walk.
No crowds and easy to get on, although the entrance was hard to find, we shared the capsule with about 5-6 others, views give you a great perspective on Singapore. It takes around 30 minutes for the Flyer to complete a full rotation. Everybody who comes to Singapore should do at least once.",,,
,,Good place,4,,This is a decent place Mostly people go here for clicking photographs :D The ticket cost is 33SGD per person. You can see most of the city from here,,,
,,Good place to see if you have time,5,,This is mostly covered during your city tour. Mostly people go here for clicking photographs Most of the city is visible from here,,,
,,Amazing views!,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is an incredible experience. The 'ride' lasts for around 30 minutes which is more than enough time to take in the scenery. As you are going up it's amazing how much you can see, but wait til you are at the top, it is crazy, you can see for miles! So many wonderful things to look at, it's truly great!",,,
,,Definitely worth the money!,5,,"Get a stunning view of Singapore, especially of Marina Bay and the Gardens by the Sea.

In the distance you can spot a great deal of ships sitting in front of Singpore鈥檚 coast line and the island of Batam (Indonesia).

It is definitely worth the money!",,,
,,Great views,4,,"The singapore flyer was closed half day for a national holiday and there were miliary vehicles and personnel there (which was a very nice suprise). when we got onto a carriage, the views were spectacular. Would really recommend you have a look!!!",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,"I visited the Singapore Flyer at around half past ten in the morning on a Tuesday. There were no queues and the capsule was shared with about seven or eight other people.

The night before I had booked online for a 10% discount and chose to pick my tickets up at the venue. It was a bit tricky to find the desk but after a walk through the 鈥榬ainforest鈥?with a koi pond I was issued a boarding card with no trouble at all.

The koi pond exists to accommodate water condensed from the modules鈥?air conditioning units, which seems to be released when the modules reach the bottom of the cycle. Quite a smart use of space!

Before boarding the wheel there is an exhibition about dreams and the development of Singapore. Some of the exhibits are a bit strange, others somewhat like government propaganda about how great Singapore is and a few plain silly.

For a silly example, one placard proudly proclaims that the netting under the wheel can sustain a weight of 100kg falling onto it and then points out that this is the same weight of many elephants! Strange, but no problem since I was here to see the wheel.

The view from the wheel was magnificent as you would expect. There was neither haze nor significant cloud and I do believe I could see into Malaysia. Many of the sights of Singapore were visible, most prominently the skyscrapers and hotels of the marina area and of course the Gardens by the Bay.

Overall, recommended.",,,
,,A little boring...,3,,"The experience was ok - i got my ticket online which gave me a 10% discount. Personally i thought it was a little boring, the whole ride took about 30 mins which is more than enough. It is a little bit of a walk from the MRT station, but not too hard to find, just get out of the mrt station and look up! I would not do this again, BUT i feel the first time is a bit of a must because afterall you are a tourist.....!",,,
,,Great views,5,,This was our first touristy thing we did when we arrived in Singapore. We went up at night and although you couldn't see much except lights and the surrounding buildings it was still great. Kids loved that it went up so high and they were able to see lights for miles.,,,
,,awesome view,5,,This is a must when in Singapore. Pick a clear day and you can see all the way to Malaysia. It is very high. but the view is outstanding.,,,
,,Amazing views,5,,This is the perfect way to see Singapore. The wheel is huge & gives a birds eye view of the city. I was intrigued to see part of the formula 1 race track as I didn't realise where it took place. Queues were not bad & they don't overcrowd the capsules.,,,
,,An excellent way to view the beauty of Singapore,4,,"For those of you that have been on the London eye, this is pretty much the same and we loved it! it was excellent value for money, plus had a lot of interesting facts inside the complex that tell you about how and when it was constructed.
And let's not forget to mention the views...... It takes around 30 minutes for each 'pod' to go around which means you have plenty of time to see EVERYTHING! Including the stunning harbour plus beautiful buildings that surround it!
Would definitely recommend a go!",,,
,,Good but Not Great,4,,"In my trip to Singapore last year, I went a ride on the Singapore Flyer. My friend suggested me and it sounded great since I haven't rode one before that. But to say, there wasn't much excitement other than the beautiful view of the town. The ride took about 30 mins and I chose the best time to ride it, the dusk. This made me see Singapore in both daylight and night time. Maybe the experience was not that great because I had high expectations. I'm not saying it was not worth it, but I wish it could have been better.",,,
,,Cool ride,4,,the ride was nice and pleasant. Great views and good way to get out of the heat. Only problem I had was the cost which was steep for just a half hour of entertainment.,,,
,,Another trip on the Singapore Flyer,4,,I loved the views from the flyer both out to sea and over Singapore. The Jungle garden was good but the fish were very full and not interested in being fed. There were few queues and it was easy to buy a ticket but the gift shop was very poor not as good as me first visit with little choice of souvenirs.,,,
,,Must Visit if near to it,4,,"I been to Singapore during transit time,
Quickly i plan to visit Singapore Flyer, after visiting Merlion Park,

Excellent Bird eye view of Singapore,

But price is bit high 33 Singapore Doller, even tokyo tower & major attraction in Japan didnt have this much price,

Overall it is good",,,
,,Good View But A Bit Not Worth,4,,"We took the ride in daytime. Before taking the ride, the are exhibition areas giving you information about the ride. The ride takes about 30 minutes. The view is great but it is a bit not worth for S$31 per adult. After the ride you could buy ice-cream at the coffee shop downstairs at 50% off with your ride ticket.",,,
,,Overpriced for an Unimpressive View,2,,"The Singapore Flyer is a high priced tourist attraction. It allows tourists to waste some time, with the inflated promise of a spectacular view. What you really get to see is the fact that Singapore really is building something on every inch of this island to the point that they will not have any natural organic beauty left. Who wants to pay to see construction sites and shipping yard with all the freighting containers? The actual skyline is not that interesting, and is a hodgepodge collage of different architectural styles that it comes off a bit messy. Although, I am sure the view, from up in the Singapore Flyer, probably does look better under the cloak of nighttime darkness, when all you can really see are the different colored lights from the structures below, however, it is still not worth the price. You can stay on the ground and view the nighttime skyline and have the same experience for free.",,,
,,Hight tea flight no tea?!!!,4,,"Come earlier at least 30 minutes becsuse you might miss you flight
We came 10 minutes earlier but were late as per Flyer stuff and waited for another 30 minutes
If you really want to taste tea at flight you will be dissapointed because they not serve tea but orange juice",,,
,,Worth the queue,5,,There was a queue to get the tickets but it was worth the wait. we did the round trip but only got off at the Jewel Box as we were limited for time,,,
,,Great for photo opportunities,3,,"We took a ride on the Singapore flyer at about 9pm and got some fantastic photos. Glad we didn't take it during the day as it sounds as though the views are a little hit and miss due to the smog (however the brochure does say you can see Malaysia and Indonesia from the top on a good day which would be impressive). We didn't queue for very long at all (5 mins max) and there were about 12 people in our capsule so the was plenty of room to walk around and take photos.

As one of the other reviewers said, there aren't many historic landmarks to see from the top (apart from the glittering hotels and shopping centres) so if you've already been on the London Eye you may feel this is a poor cousin (despite the Singapore Flyer being the higher wheel). The rainforest walk, bars and souvenir shops at the bottom seemed a bit naff (unless you've got small children) so we didn't hang around for too long.

TIP: we presented our Singapore Air / Silk Air boarding card at the ticket desk and received 10% off the price.",,,
,,Stunning!,5,,"Try to be the last one boarding! Late in the evening it is empty, and the view is fantastic! We got there at 21:30 and we were very lucky!",,,
,,Best to go at night,4,,"Went once two years back during day time, not good as it was cloudy and we could not see much. this time we went at night and it is so much better! splendid view of singapore!",,,
,,Great view for pictures,5,,"Best place for pics of singapore We coupled hat with a fish doctor session in kenko A big laughing party. I do recommend it, this value for money and lot of emotions",,,
,,Worth it for the views,4,,"The views are spectacular and if you are with a group of friends this is a pretty fun way to spend a few hours. While a rotation is right at 30 min, there is ton of stuff to do/eat at and around the Flyer. I would be interested in trying one of their specialty flights, but not sure I have the patience to take 2 rotations.",,,
,,Good views of the city,4,,"I had been to Flyer on 26Jul 2013 (luckyly no haze). I would suggest go during the sun set time to get best views. Worthy experience, cant miss this.",,,
,,"""Nice View""",5,,"It should be a Must Visit for a Tourist as one can view entire Singapore from this large wheel.
It moves slowly & takes around 20-25 minutes for the whole round. Hi rise buildings, Sea & other attractions are best viewed from here. It is a Paradise for Photographers as lots of good photos can be clicked from the wheel. It may be expensive for some but for one timer it is a must visit place.
It is a 10 min walk from Promenade MRT station.",,,
,,"Pricey, but worth the views",4,,"Though the price is expensive, aside from the London Eye, where else can you have this opportunity? The views of the entire city are great and you have enough time to really take it all in because of the duration of the ride. Best to go in off-peak times so that your capsule is not overly full and you can really walk around and see the 360 degrees of the view. You don't even really feel like you are moving so would be suitable for those with motion sickness issues as well.",,,
,,Great view,5,,Went to the flyer in singapore. the place is great. the view is amazing and the lines (during the week in the morning) were quite short. worth the high price. a must in Singapore.,,,
,,Fun to visit,4,,"Definitely worth visiting once when in Singapore. The experience is memorable with the excellent view! Quite expensive but for once it is ok. I wouldn't visit a second time, but definitely glad I went.",,,
,,Better to come at night....,4,,"This is the second time I ride this gigantic wheel, the first time at day and now at night and it comes up with conclusion: night is better view. Going to this place with Hop on Hop off Sightseeing Bus, queuing the ticket and queuing to enter the wheel is the process that we have to follow before enjoying the scenery from the whell. Everybody must be curious about how to ride the biggest wheel in the world. The 30 minutes ride inside it will answer your curiosity. Maybe nothing special up there but it will ""paid"" every single question in your mind. At the day, you just enjoy the building view and some view of docking area at the harbour (which I don't like). But at night , the view is awesome, the light view from the building and the street is very nice. Showing us the beauty of big city. After you finished, you can step in the souvenir shop and enjoy the meal at restaurant at the ground floor area.",,,
,,Great Views,5,,"This attraction takes 30 minutes for one complete cycle. We went at sunset- which was a great time of day. We saw many boats, the CBD, gardens by the bay, everything. It should definitely be included in any trip! It's was quite difficult to reach due to the national day rehearsals, but we got there in the end.",,,
,,Wow!,5,,"I admit that it took a good 10 minutes of being in this thing before my nerves dissipated (It's the constant rising that freaks me out - once I'm at the top, I'm happy!) but it was totally worth it.

The views you can get from the world's largest observation wheel (not a ferris wheel apparently!) are stunning. We went about an hour after sunset because we had messed up our timings slightly - we went on the London eye during sunset last year which was perfect and wanted to replicate that on the Singapore flyer but nevermind.

The flyer lights up and looks great as part of the scenery, but the lights inside the pods are quite dim so your view of Singapore is not obscured. As anybody who has tried to take pictures at night through a window will tell you, you need to get the lens right up to the glass to avoid reflection in your images, which can lead to sudden bouts of vertigo!

Before you enter the flyer, you go through a mini interactive centre which shows exactly how it was built and contains facts about the wheel, which was quite fun and interesting.

If you are in Singapore, this is a must do activity. How can you pass up going on the world's largest observational wheel and getting the best view of such a beautiful city.

This cost us about S$33 each (about 拢18) which I think is comparable with the London Eye.",,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"The great thing is that you'll be able to see the all city, a must do if you go there. Not expensive and great fun.",,,
,,"I thought it was something different, it's just a Ferris wheel.",3,,"I thought it was something different, but it's just a Ferris wheel. The experience is nice up high above over looking the city skyline. Other than that is pretty much just a Ferris wheel, but i think it's better than paying to go up to that new hotel that look like a ship.",,,
,,Tick the box,3,,"We went there in July and did the package deal which includes Singapore Flyer, Duck tour and hawker food. I guessed for the price it was worth it but if we have to do this individually then it will not be worth it.

The Singapore Flyer was so so and not as good compare to last time when we did the Sky Park. We did it in the morning on a clear day so it was not so bad. Half an jour per rotation and best view last for less than 10 minutes.

We were packed with at least another 14-16 people so it was not too great ... everyone posing and taking photos in the limited space.

It was a tick in the box thing to do in Singapore and that was it.

Nothing special",,,
,,Sky high,5,,"Absolutely fabulous ... A must do for visitors to Singapore. Allow An hour as there is a wait to get on but once on board it is spectacular. We boarded as it was nearing sunset and got to see the sights in daylight and at night. Recommend doing this .. The lights are brilliant. Takes about half an hour to do full rotation and you need every minute as there is so much to see from up there. We were lucky to view the rehearsal for ""national day celebrations"" which Was an added bonus, especially the fireworks at the end. Cost was about $30 from memory and well worth it",,,
,,Worthwile,5,,When visiting Singapore this is a must do! It's the biggelt wheel in the world and you'll have a splendid view over the Marina Bay.,,,
,,Good ride good scenery,4,,"I liked the build up to the ride, the photo shoot, pictures on the wall etc. the 30 minutes went so fast. I got a good view of singapore",,,
,,Great views and worth the price,5,,"This is a large ""Ferris wheel"" that rises about 540 feet in the air. Each of the capsules can carry 28 people, but the panoramic view over the crowded port and island are magnificent. For me, it was worth the $26 (discounts are available that may include other tours). I had a much better appreciation of Singapore after this experience.",,,
,,A large ferris wheel,3,,"Like the london eye, the singapore flyer was interesting for a relatively short period of time. However, once the view had been taken in, there was little else to do until it completed its long rotation.",,,
,,what a view,5,,This is an exceptional way to capture the depth of singapore and its surrounds. You go exceptionally high and have excellent 360 degree views.,,,
,,Terrific views of Singapore!,4,,This was a terrific way to get a bird's eye view of Singapore ... very relaxing ride and well worth the effort of enduring the queues which can be quite long.,,,
,,Beautiful Views with a Break from the Heat,4,,"Not much new to say about attractions like this that haven't already been said. Great views, the AC is a blessing during the day, and they seem to meter the crowds so each of the cabins will have people in them but not feel over crowded. One loop around is about 20 - 30 min. If you've never been on one of these before, the one in Singapore is a nice one to check out.",,,
,,"Great view, but...",4,,"Considered a ""must do"" in Singapore, we decided to finally give the wheel a whirl, as it were, having lived here now for just over a year. The Flyer takes just under half an hour to complete one full rotation - slow enough to take photos and enjoy the scenery, but also slow enough for our children (aged nine and seven) to start asking if we were going to get off soon. The views from all sides of the capsule are really wonderful, so go on a nice clear day to make it worthwhile. The cost was S$33 per adult, which felt steep, but the kids were free with a current promotion. Another great view of Singapore can be had from Marina Bay Sands. It's not as sweeping a view as one gets from the Flyer, but also a good option.",,,
,,best view of the marina bay,5,,go in the evenings - can appreciate the lightings and have a good view of the city as well...ask for promo tickets at your hotel - they give a discount,,,
,,worth trying,4,,"tried it twice last year-september & december 2012.went with some friends the first time and family members the second time. we went around 6:30 pm
just about sunset so we got to see the view when the sun was still up for a while then when it was already dark. the view of the city lights was nice.",,,
,,Worth going!,5,,I really enjoyed the scenery... wasn't hard to get a ticket and not too expensive either. it was air conditioned which helped.. Definitely worth a visit! :),,,
,,View is great but Price is steep,2,,"Its half and hour. The queue can be long depending if it's weekday or weekend/public holidays.

Thunderstorm may stop the attraction operationsfor safety of passengers.

Probably it's an attraction that you tried once and thats it. Seldom one will go for twice round unless it's free. Price is around 20+.",,,
,,Pricey but worth a visit for the experience and the views,4,,"The 30 minutes ride on the Singapore Flyer is great for the experience. Personally I think it is a little expensive for what it is, however it is 5 m taller than the London eye so I suppose they are justified in what they are charging. Definitely better to go on a clear day so that you can see further towards Indonesia and Malaysia. Great opportunities to take lots of photos on the ride. This would be one of those experiences that you would put on your bucket list and tick off while not having to repeat again.",,,
,,30-40 minutes,4,,"The cabin, is very nice..the views, surroundings are extra ordinary..suitable for family who bring kids..",,,
,,Nice view !!!,4,,Have been to the Singapore flyer twice and it has been a good experience. Nice view of Singapore .The rotation is at a very slow rate giving one a chance to enjoy the view for a long time. However it might get boring after a while.Better go at night -so as to enjoy the lights.,,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Impressing view! Like it a lot. Recommended if you are in Singapore for the first time, and you must bring your camera ore phone and take pictures.",,,
,,wonderful views,5,,Great experience. The Flyer is comfortable and feels safe. Such a great way to see more of Singapore.,,,
,,To go or Not to Go,3,,"Nothing great. No WOW factor. Just a ride up and round. Went in the day time, maybe at night it is better for a night view of singapore. Then again, u could get a better night view at one altitude or MBS",,,
,,Lovely view of Singapore - nice and cool inside the Flyer :),5,,"We took a taxi from the airport to the Singapore Flyer - about 30 mins. We bought our tickets from the office on the ground floor and moved onto the upper level to board the Flyer. It is a slow, relaxing ride and you get to see the Singapore skyline, coastline, and surrounding areas.",,,
,,magnificent views,5,,"When we went on this, we were tired and jet lagged, but it was an awesome experience. The walk up to the flyer was fun and has lots of new information. We did this at night, so the view was spectacular. Much better than the London eye! You can get a combo tickets which are cheaper than individual tickets.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,3,,The Singapore Flyer is under receivership. Check their website to see if they are still in operation. You can see the when from the Flyer if you go to my apgclh channel on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ji-axvwprEw,,,
,,A Good View from The Singapore Flyer,4,,"A good one time experience riding the SIngapore Flyer. The queue to the Flyer boarding area is very orderly with many attendants guiding you along the way from the entrance. You board while the Flyer is rotating continuously but at a very very slow pace, so it's not a frightening experience for children and senior citizens. The ideal time to ride it is just before sunset as you get two different views from daylight to dusk of Singapore's commercial banking district in the Shenton Way area and Marina Bay entertainment resort which lights up beautifully for the evening as the Flyer descends for the end journey. I would recommend it to any visitor visiting Singapore for the first time.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"Well worth going excellent view of the city and commentary explaining buildings old and new. It also gives one a good insite of the expansion Singapore has gone through over the years, from Raffles to Marina Bay and Sands complex. After the flyer a visit to the Gardens at Marina Bay worth doing and then go up the lift to the roof top at the Sands Hotel for the view, warning they charge to go up to the roof top but worth it.",,,
,,Excellent views,5,,"Do not pay seperately for the tickets, buy a tripper pass from Luxury travel at Concord Hotel, its worth it.",,,
,,Nice view in the day and night,5,,"This is just like any other Ferris wheel around the world but not many has capsule-type. View of the beautiful Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands and Central Business District can be seen both in the day and in the night. Look for discounts if possible. Enjoy!",,,
,,Nice Places,4,,you can have a great look through with birds eye view of captivating singapore marina bay and 360 panoramic view!,,,
,,A must do when in Singapore,5,,Great experience and wonderful views of the city and the ships at sea. A very well managed experience with helpful staff. Very happy we did it.,,,
,,Great view on a great day,5,,"Good attraction for checking out the view of the skyline and the marina barrage and a lot of other things in Singapore. A good trip of all. Being a local, I have done this a few times because I had to bring friends from overseas and it's nice every time! Great for all.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,3,,"There are some nice restaurants and local food near the Singapore Flyer where you can enjoy after the ride. However, there's other alternatives like MBS roof-top pool, OUB plaza roof top bar, etc where you also can enjoy good view for longer period of time.",,,
,,Good overview,3,,"This is expensive but gives a good overview of downtown Singapore. You get an idea if the scale of things - the city - old and new - the Gardens By The Bay, the Marina Bay Sands etc. Just alright.",,,
,,Bird's eye 360 view,4,,Pick a clear day n you can see a lot more. There are even romantic meal programs you can choose to do on the Flyer. It takes half an hour to go a full round but you can barely sense it.,,,
,,Great view up there,3,,The ride was boring thus I recommend you have someone or a group of friends with you coz 30mins takes quite sometime. The shops downstairs are worth trying and hanging out there is great.,,,
,,Too pricey and place not easy to locate for tourists on foot,3,,Tickets are too pricey for budget tourists. Finding the place on foot is not easy as traffic towards flyers are heavy at all times The attraction is good for one time experience.,,,
,,Good to visit twice (Day & Night),4,,"Day and night time offers a different perspective of Singapore. If you are a avid photographer, this is the place to be to capture the horizon of Singapore.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,3,,It's a nice place to visit to see the whole of singapore landscape. The Q is not long and it is near the city area.,,,
,,Spectacular Views!,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is the worlds largest observation wheel, towering 92 feet taller than the London Eye. Each capsule holds up to 32 people comfortably. You can also book in advance a private capsule for a one-of-a-kind dining experience. The wheel takes approximately 30 minutes to make a complete revolution. The cost is $33 Singapore Dollars for 1 ticket. I rode the wheel at night and the glistening lights of Singapore, Singapore Bay, Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the Gardens by the Bay were spectacular! I highly recommend taking a ride on the Singapore Flyer!",,,
,,Nice view,4,,It's a decent attraction; but not outstanding. You get view if entire city and beyond with clear weather. A little expensive though - would like more fun stuff/ activities around the flyer.,,,
,,Singapore Skyline,3,,"We attended a wedding in the Flyer. It takes about 30 mins to complete one full circle. You get a pretty good view of the Singapore skyline including Marina Bay Sands, Central business district, Arts museum, seaview etc. Would recommend taking the ride around 5 - 630 pm to have a better experience.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,4,,"hmm this is one of the nice icon for SIngapore. Even as a local (Singaporean), i will also make my trip to SIngapore flyer and enjoy the slow and steady ride. The whole ride is about 28mins and you will be able to see alot of nice stunning views like Marina Bay sands, Gardens by the bay, some of the F1 pit. etc. You will definitely not to be disappointed.

And there are alot of nice resturants around, so you can have a nice meal after a fantastic ride :) It is one of my favourite hangout place too.",,,
,,Overpriced waste of time,2,,"The Singapore Flyer is one of many observation wheels ( not to be confused with ferris wheels) which have sprouted around the world after the success of the London Eye. However, this is not a worthwhile experience in Singapore; all you see are the high-rise buildings on one side and the lagoon ( not the open sea) on the other. Quite different from London where you see so many iconic buildings like St Pauls, Westminster Abbey etc from a vantage point.

It's better and cheaper to go up to the top of Marina Bay Sands for a panoramic view of Singapore. In fact, the Singapore Flyer is doing so poorly that it is now in receivership ( Chapter 11).",,,
,,Nightview is excellent!!,4,,"View is good except that the ticket price is expensive. Overall, worth a try for morning and evening ride.",,,
,,Must not miss,5,,"This is a place where you can take your time to enjoy the view. must experience whilst in Singapore. My wife & I not great with heights but we boarded a capsule for this venture & were not disappointed. Each capsule is air conditioned with simply stunning views over the Singapore financial precinct, Marina Bay Sands & the Gardens by the Bay to name a few. The Singapore Flyer takes 35...",,,
,,"It's big, beautiful, and鈥?(kind of) boring. With just a bit of effort, it can be much, much better.",4,,"This gorgeous device sits atop one of Asia's most breathtaking harbor views-especially around sunset. Sadly, there's so little information about WHAT we're viewing, that our experience seems empty. Clever use of IT (think smartphones accessing different channels, depending on our language and interests) can transform it into a dynamic and memorable experience. Better yet, Google Glasses!",,,
,,Circling in awe...,5,,"What a great way to see all the sights in that area, especially the gardens. Walking inside would have been great but seeing it from above was spectacular,",,,
,,"FOR : sightseeing, photo taking /// AGAINST : nothing else to do, really",3,,"FOR :
Nice view of the city from high up
Good for photography, esp during the golden hours (ok, only sunset...)

AGAINST :
Nothing much to see except the cityscape of Singapore
Seeing from far is different from experiencing up close
Nothing else to do there (ok, there is a food court serving a good variety of local food, but the standard of the food is only average at best)",,,
,,Fantastic views from the Flyer,4,,"I have been to the Singapore Flyer three times and I enjoyed it every time. My visitors took lots of photos of Singapore bay area. Some people may find it boring because it moves slowly but then, what a great opportunity to take scenic photos from up above! All three times, I managed to get discounted tickets from charity drive and from friends.

I love to eat at the hawker stalls below the Flyer. The deco is very uniquely vintage like in the old days. A good place to spend about 2 hours of the day. Only thing is you have to walk a bit to get there from the nearest MRT or from Marina Bay Sands.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"A worthwhile view of Singapore during the day and stunningly beautiful at night. The laser show starts at 8 every night and more often during festivals but get there early to avoid disappointment. It's a great show from up there. Otherwise, try to avoid the crowds if you want privacy. You could share a gondola with up to 18 people! My wife and I went late, just before closing time and we had one to ourselves! Check before you go.
For the moneyed, there are private ones available, even some that are catered with on-board waiters. I didn't try them so I cannot comment but they looked great!",,,
,,Excellent view up above,5,,"Even though the ride is not that long, I think more than 30 mins, the view of the Singapore skyline is fantastic. Was advised the best time to go is around the time the sun is setting. In the same location, there are great Singapore well known food that you can eat at the food street.",,,
,,must go place especially if you are a first time visitor to Singapore.,5,,personally been there once with my family. i must commend that this Singapore ferris wheel indeed offers a spectacular view of Singapore! i went there between 7-9pm... i would give it a 10/10... make sure your visit is without the rain!,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,3,,The views are great but unless you're an engineer - probably will feel a bit 'boring'. The ride is nice and slow and the views are quite impressive.,,,
,,Take the flyer in the night and not the day,3,,"Done both the day and night trip, the night scenery far surpasses the day scenery. Not cheap to go as a family, thus maximize the value of your spending.",,,
,,Hot and stuffy.,2,,"The weather is torturous. Can't imagine why would any tourist wanna tour Singapore! It's expensive, overcrowded and the inhabitants are getting more and more rude.",,,
,,My Singapore amazing,4,,Nice superb view from top. Pls go toilet before u in the capsule coz it take abt more than 30mins for the 360 degress view,,,
,,Best Time at Dusk,4,,"This wonderful experience is best when visited at dusk just as the city lights are beginning to brighten the skyline. Awesome views. Loved it, both young and old members of family.",,,
,,Must do if you are visiting Singapore.,4,,"I have done this twice - once during the day time and once at night. The view during both is equally stunning! After having experienced really long queues while waiting for our turn in the London Eye, I was also worried about the queue here, but it is really well managed and there is hardly any wait to get in!",,,
,,Great Views,4,,"I've done this twice now... it gives great views of the city, and you can see the race course really well from the ride. The compartments are clean and easy to walk around in. Very comparable to the London Eye.",,,
,,Breathtaking views,4,,"A must experience whilst in Singapore. My wife & I not great with heights but we boarded a capsule for this venture & were not disappointed. Each capsule is air conditioned with simply stunning views over the Singapore financial precinct, Marina Bay Sands & the Gardens by the Bay to name a few. The Singapore Flyer takes 35 minutes to complete a full revolution so the feeling of heights not worry some at all. Best time to go is just on dusk where you can take in the breathtaking sights and then experience the lights illuminating. Try for a clear sunny day another option if
Cyou can to appreciate the panorama.",,,
,,Akin to other large wheels.,3,,"We visited on a Thursday around lunchtime. Easy to locate, (it is the world's largest, at the moment). Fairly easy to find the ticket office. Good price, compared with the London Eye and no queue to buy tickets which was a nice surprise.

The 'pre-flight' walk through consisted of things to keep the kids amused. Good idea if there were any queues, which again there weren't. We had to wait about 5 minutes at 'boarding' but that was it.

The flyer takes around 30 minutes to rotate so there's plenty of time to see everything. You a given a cartoon map which explains what you are looking at. This was the only let down really, it didn't give you much detail of what was out there.

Other than the flyer itself, there are restaurants and cafes and other things to do whilst you're there.

Worth a visit if you have some time to kill.",,,
,,Fantastic views at night,4,,"What a lovely way to see the sights of Singapore, such a beautiful city at night. There was no queue for tickets and we waited only a short time to actually get on the wheel.",,,
,,Great Scenic Views,5,,"This is a great way to view the Singapore skyline. Even better was the ease of access for my mother in law in her wheelchair. the staff where fantastic & made the boarding & disembarking of the Flyer smooth as. The views are fantastic & we where pretty lucky on the day (18/7/13) that the smoke haze from Indonesia was very low. The price to board obviously needs to be considered as it was $29 per adult so if you're on a tight budget, it might not be feasible..",,,
,,You have to do it,4,,It's expensive but you are in Singapore so you have to do it. The views are stunning. Tip: if you travelled via Singapore Airlines and bring your boarding pass you can get a discount on the tickets.,,,
,,It's just Ok,3,,"I believe its location is not the best, its connection with both the city skyline and surrounding landmarks is poor. I'd dare to say that its orientation (so best views are achieved) could have been better. This ride should be at least half of its actual price or free.",,,
,,Better Done In The Dark......,4,,"After visiting Botanic Garden and Gardens by the Bay, we dared ourselves to cross the bridge to the Singapore Flyer across the bay. It was a good 8 to 10 mins walk and I would bet that not a lot if any choose to go this way. We made it across and purchased the ticket right away. There are more restaurants in the area with tour buses, chartered vehicles and taxis....an obvious tourist attraction. The Singapore Flyer was more of a hybrid cable car and a slow moving ferris wheel at a bigger scale. Cable car because it has enclosed pod, not like in a ferris wheel鈥檚 open seating set-up and fairly slow moving. From the distance, you might think that it鈥檚 not moving at all but once you really pay close attention, it does move....in a very slow pace. I would recommend riding the Singapore Flyer at night.",,,
,,An experience not to miss,4,,This was a nice way to see the night lights of Singapore. The food was ok and the service was good. It went around twice in an hour so it was at a leisurely pace.,,,
,,Go at night for the nighttime view,4,,"An almost perfect replication of the London eye - except that plenty of construction on the island is visible to the eye when you go in the day. Come at night, where you can see the night time skyline lit up in beautiful colors, and when there isn't any glare from the sun and the heat.",,,
,,Feeling acomplished,4,,"The queing is under control, it was very high for me and i can see like a whole marina bays, the buildings around. But, it's pitty i have to pay for the picture we take from the entry door for 20 $SGD. But after all it was really a good experienced being very high up to the sky.",,,
,,You like photography? Don't miss this.,5,,"It does not look very impressive from the ground level. But once you are on it, it's a different matter. It revolves very slowly and gives you ample time and opportunity to click some beautiful shots. The ship building looks very different when you are at the top of the wheel. The concrete jungle around it and the serpentine highway running through them somehow start looking interesting. Don't miss it.",,,
,,Fun for everyone,4,,"Fighting jet lag my colleague convinced me to give this ride a try, after sharing more PBS show facts than I ever wanted to hear. Anyway, I'm glad he did, as it was an excellent diversion even on a dreary day.
Sharing the space with a large family of visitors from the Philippines made it special as the children oohhh'd and ahhhd'd the entire ride.
I'd go back again on a clear day to see how far out into the bay ships would be visible. If you're in town, make sure to get on the Hop On - Hop Off tour bus which ends at the flyer.",,,
,,Slow moving boredom...,3,,I went with a friend that wanted to do this so I agreed to go. It was about $30 and we did it at night so the lights were impressive. Since the cars take a long time to get around it got a bit tedious. The air con in the carriage was not working well and so was very stuffy and hot...(at night!). You really only see one side of the impressive skyline of Singapore... but to be honest standing for free down by the Merlion was about as good (cheaper) to get a sense of the grandeur of this amazing city. So if you have money to burn go for it...,,,
,,Amazing views! But read on...,4,,"Almost flawless!

We splurged more for VIP treatment for this attraction - ie. Signature Cocktail VIP flyer ($69 per person)

And i tell you what - ITS DEFINITELY WORTH IT!

We were led to a VIP lounge to relax before taken exclusively to a nicely pimped up ""Moet & Chandon"" flyer - catered for the VIP's only. It was very funny when we hopped in we were met with other tourists outside taking photos of our bling'd up flyer departing - paparazzi style!

Naturally, the views were absolutely amazing - the only disappointment was the price (comparing to general admission which was $33) - but its DEFINITELY worth the extra spend in our humble opinion.",,,
,,Lovely attraction - Great views,5,,We had a great time on the Singapore Flyer - really nice facility and the views are great. Each viewing compartment is air conditioned and it's really relaxing to sit for about 1/2 hour and enjoy the sights.,,,
,,Really tall!,5,,"The wait to get on the gondola was a few minutes, which was really nice. The actual gondola is very comfortable. You cannot feel it rotating at all. The views were exceptional.",,,
,,Fabulous flyer,5,,"The Singapore flyer is a great experience all round, from the tix available online at a great price for seniors (it was supposedly only for locals or residents,but we didn't know that and nobody questioned us) through the ""dreamscape"" on entering- an entertaining educational experience, to the actual ride/flight - a magic 30-45 minute everchanging birds-eye view of the city of Singapore and surrounds. Wow, we loved it and so did others in our ""capsule"".",,,
,,"God view nice sized cabins, easy access..staff is friendly",4,,"God view nice sized cabins, easy access..staff is friendly..how ever no commentary or visuals is a bit dampner .. I think London eye is much better than this. None the less its a must do at Singapore",,,
,,Must See Singapore!,5,,"The Singapore Flyer all but gets ignored by locals and many tourists who stay at the Marina Bay Sans Hotel which has similar views. My understanding is that since its opening the Flyer has underwhelmed almost everyone.

Thant said, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Thanks to nonexistent lines we flew (pun intended) right into the flyer's queue and had a very cool, comfy view of the Singapore Skyline from a perspective that is different than what you see from the Marina Bay Sands rooftop deck. On board air conditioning provided a cool break from the withering Singapore heat.

It's really worth a look.",,,
,,Not for the faint hearted...,5,,"Being from England I have visited the London Eye and was somewhat dry mouthed as the eye passed over its highest point and began to decend - not being most comfortable in high places... Then I went on the Singapore Flyer!

Beyond my initial fear that I would need assisting off the ride by my family, I was not at all sure I would enjoy this attraction, but how wrong I was.

Once the Flyer leaves the ground and you begin to view the spectacular sights close by; the botanical garden over the bay, the Sands Hotel standing taller even than the flyer, you forget you don't like heights and are simply absorbed. I loved it and thought it was certainly value for money. Clean, air conditioned sufficient for comfort, spacious and extremely well run, the Flyer was excellent and my family were keen to go on another day... Well worth a visit.",,,
,,Great way to get perspective,4,,The wheel seems to turn slower than the London Eye - we found it more pleasant. Nice eateries at the complex.,,,
,,High Flyer,5,,"Fantastic views of Singapore. This is worth every penny. We went with two friends. One of them is terrified of heights. But she was so glad she went. The views are truly spectacular, and at night the City is an amazing blaze of light. A must see!",,,
,,Worth Watching,5,,"It was a wonderful experience, the place where it situated also had many other attraction like 6D theater. Flight simulator, Duck Drive, etc... nice experience overall.",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,Choose your time and day when the weather is clear. The views are stunning and the capsule provide panoramic views of the surrounding city. The ride last for approximately 30 minutes.. For a different perspective try the ride at night ... worth doing,,,
,,First time in the flyer,4,,It's quite big when you get close. Expensive if you ask me. Purposefully took the 8.30 pm ride for enjoying the night skyline. Fantastic view. Next trip will be with friends / family and Without kids.,,,
,,Terrific view of Singapore,4,,"Great experience - even those scared of heights loved it. Amazing view of Singapore and gives a good overview of the city. No feeling of motion or wind at all - brilliant!

Tip: If it looks like rain, get on the Flyer ASAP as they don't board new passengers when raining but the current passengers get to stay on:)",,,
,,recommend sunset.,5,,We went on sunset and it was fantastic to see the city lighting up.We the walked across Helix Bridge and watched the free laser show in front of MBS which was also fabulous.Then had dinner at the food court in MBS shops.It was a fabulous evening for the whole family.,,,
,,Propose in the air,5,,"My Singaporean colleagues took me on the Flyer as my introduction to the City. This is NOT like a ferris wheel. It is a peaceful stunning aerial view of the City's treasures. Amazingly, some couples order a special meal or champagne for the 20 minute ride, and come out affianced!",,,
,,Nice view,4,,"Queue seemed quite long, but moved at a very good pace. We boarded our ""capsule"" in no time. Fantastic views, especially on a clear day. In the evening, at 8:30pm you can see the laser show in the bay",,,
,,Average,3,,It wasn't the most interesting. I still enjoyed it - just not as great as I expected. Maybe going at night would be a good idea.,,,
,,"Not cheap ride, but very nice views",5,,"The entrance fee may not be cheap. Go at night time where you could have very nice night view. You can view it 360 degrees. Very comfortable ride unless you are afraid of height (you may just sit down, seats are available also).",,,
,,Fun to visit once,4,,"It is certainly worth visiting once whilst you are in Singapore. The experience is memorable and the view is good, although the view from Marina Bay Sands is better. I probably wouldn't visit a second time, but definitely glad I went.",,,
,,Truly Amazing Experience,5,,"A truly amazing experience. This happens to be the world's tallest observation wheel, height of about 165m. When on top you can see the Singapore city, Malaysia and Gardens.",,,
,,Amazing wheel!!,5,,"Amazing!! if you plan to go to flyer then don't forget to take camera with you. the view at the sunset time around 6pm is beautiful. it takes about 30 minutes for the ride, worth a try when you visit Singapore.",,,
,,Fantastic way to get an aerial view of Singapore,4,,"This is a great way to get an aerial view of Singapore and the bay. Good for getting your bearings, takes approx. 30 minutes for a circuit. Recommended.",,,
,,Just average,3,,"The first 5 minutes were exciting but then it was much the same for the whole trip. We thankfully got our own pod for just the two of us. It was very slow and it rained the whole time we were up there so visibility wasn't fabulous (although we cannot blame Singapore Flyer for that). Suggest that on a clear day that it would be a much better trip. It was difficult to find our way to the Flyer. We chose to get there via MRT - (and a walk through the countryside) there weren't many signposts and other than looking up into the sky and walking towards the flyer, we would have found it difficult to get there. Average but not great.",,,
,,Very cool way to see singapore,4,,"Not exactly adrenalin pumping ....just like a massive hi tech ferris wheel, just a good way to see the singapore skyline....you get a 20% discount with singapore airlines tickets presented at ticket booth ...worth doing, great to take photos.",,,
,,Wonderful Views,4,,"We decided to do this trip on the last day of our holiday in Singapore as a special outing and we were not disappointed. The visit did not start the way that we expected as we wished to take the champagne flight but we were told that we had to book in advance to do that. Nowhere in the brochures that we had been given did it say that. Not deterred we bought tickets on an ordinary flight, we paid 16singapore dollars which I did not think was too expensive. To enter the flyer you walk through an interesting exhibit which gets you in the mood for the trip. To get on and off the flyer is very easy and there are plenty of staff to help. I do not know if it is usual but we shared the capsule with only one other couple so it was easy to walk around and see the views from all sides. It takes about 30 minutes to do the trip and the views are spectacular especially out to sea. Take your camera as the pictures that we took were spectacular!",,,
,,nice view,5,,We went at night and the view was amazing. It was so pretty and you cannot feel the movement of the capsule. Worth the visit..,,,
,,Fantastic view on the city,4,,"The Singapore Flyer stand at 165 meters and is even taller than the London Eye. It gives you a visual feast of the Marina Bay, the great icons and landmarks of Singapore.

The best time to go is the night as it's open from 8.30am to 10.30pm.

Price is SGD 29.50 for adult (approx USD 23.50) and little bit less for children.

Easy access by metro, as MRT stops at the City Hall MR Station about 10 minutes away form the Singapore Flyer.",,,
,,Nice view of Singapore,4,,"This is actually my 2nd time here.. I went here with my family with 2 children. We were lucky enough to browse the site and found out the buy 1 get 1 for children by informing the catchphrase of captain flyer to the ticket counter...

We went there during the daytime so it's quite hot outside, but the capsule's aircon is nice enough and gave us full comfort during the ride there.. The view is not as nice as in the afternoon/sunset time but okay enough for the children...

After the ride we went to grab lunch on the food court downstairs, sadly we were all disappointed with the food taste ...

Overall wonderful experience as long as you're not having meals downstairs..",,,
,,catch the best sunset in Flyer,5,,I love the giant wheels. especially in sunset time. I love how the sun sink between the skyscraper. just had a good time in there. hope that the wheels will round twice. :p,,,
,,Super,5,,"We really enjoyed our 30 minute flight. we picked a lovely day and the views were magnificent. We went at lunch time, but could imagine it at night. Not at all scary if you have a fear of heights.",,,
,,You must try,4,,"No doubt , it is awesome and you dont miss the best night scenery of singapore . the music and air condition in the whole structure is comfortable.
i just have a bit disappointed about the time passed so fast and some
structure on the shore is quite far . But i regard this is the trump of tourism structure in singapore . it bloom the city in best view either you in the cable or look at it in distance .
Must spend a night there and dont miss to take your best video in the trip.",,,
,,Great Views,5,,"I don't like ferris wheels and being high, but this was a wonderful experience. You don't feel apprehensive at all, feel no motion, and get a wonderful view of Singapore. I have a camera with a 20 zoom and was able to get the Merlion close up and far away...interesting contrast.",,,
,,A great view of Singapore,4,,"It is like a moving observation deck, a very wonderful view of Singapore. It is quite a long ride, I would suggest that they put a video introducing the various popular spots that we passed by along the way. Probably because of the high price, there was no line even in summer travel season.",,,
,,A Must When You Visit Singapore,5,,"If you want outstanding views of this beautiful city, and great photo opportunities this is the place. It is not a thrill ride as its' name might suggest, but a leisurely trip in spacious cars. We highly recommend the Flyer.",,,
,,Giant wheel.... definitely better than London eye...,5,,"June 2012.... I was actually not much impressed by Singapore as such, a city, as it was turning out to be another concrete jungle.... until we climbed in this technological marvel.

It is on the lines of London eye but much better ....
Kids loved it.... coz the view on the sea side was breath taking.... with new modern garden coming up (it was not opened till that time).... it was looking awesome.",,,
,,"Another touristic ""must-do""",3,,"The process of entrance was very smooth. Nice views from the top. But nothing exceptional. We did it because it was right next to our hotel and a must-do while in Singapore. You won't miss much if you don't do it, though.
The souvenir shops are good!",,,
,,WHAT A VIEW!!!,5,,The views from the Singapore Flyer were just awesome. Good value for money since we utilised the Singapore Airlines boarding card privilages. Would definately love to revisit this on every trip to SG.,,,
,,Different day and night,4,,"Nice smooth ride, easy to get on/off even for disabled. See all of Singapore and more. Be prepared for a wait as the Flyer does not operate unless the conditions are right, so wind and rain can halt the wheel. I would suggest that if you want to do the flyer, then don't leave it till your last day, or you may be disappointed if it closes due to weather.",,,
,,one of those have to things,4,,It really is slow and boring but you still have to do it. I personally recommend at night because Singapore is one of the best lit up cities in world. It is a fantastic view and is pretty much a Singapore staple so it is money well spent. And for all that tourist trap nonsense. If your visiting some place your a tourist get over it and yourself and enjoy life.,,,
,,Just have to do it,5,,"This is one of those experiences that you just have to do, but its not a change your life experience.It's very slow moving, so would be fine for anyone. There are seats inside the capsule, but most people in ours moved around taking photo's. The only thing they may ate it difficult for some people to get on and off is that you have to do that while its moving. It is moving very slow. We managed to do it with a stroller.",,,
,,The biggest ferris wheel I have been on,4,,I had some time before heading to the airport & thought I would go on the flyer. A great one off experience seeing the panoramic views. The bonus was being in the carriage unit with families from Malaysia & Indonesia who thought the single Aussie was the greatest. I took their family photos & then they wanted pictures with me in them !,,,
,,The wheel,5,,We went on the Flyer at night and seeing all the lights of Singapore was a great treat. It took about 30 minutes to go around so it was worth the money. A must do when in Singapore.,,,
,,See whole of Singaposre from Top.,4,,"Best location to view Singapore from height. You can see Indonasian Island from height. All great attraction like Esplanade, Marina Bay Sands, Formula 1 track, everything. Its a great experience.",,,
,,it is ok... only ok,3,,"what can i say... it is ok... 78 SD for a family of 3 to see not more than what i can see from the top of the Marina bay Sands.
so if you can chose between a good beer at the bar on top of the hotel and the ride in the flyer... don't think twice...",,,
,,Beautiful view over Singapore,4,,"Definitely worth taking the ride, you get the most beautiful views over Singapore. We did the ride at night, it looked amazing and managed to get some beautiful photos especially of the Botanical Gardens",,,
,,So and so.,3,,"This wheel was alright. The facilities seemed a bit dated considering how new it is, the view was pretty good. As we had visited the free Marina Bay Sands viewing deck earlier in the day, it was a bit disappointing to have a lesser view for such a big amount of money. We visited in the early evening on a weekday and it was very quick and easy to get on.",,,
,,Good view of Singapore,4,,"Not the romantic couple activity we first dreamed of, as you sit in a tube with 10-15 other people. But it gives a good view over the city, nice pictures, and after all - a trip in the worlds largest ferry wheel!",,,
,,must xperience,5,,"i had visited singapore flyer last week,,it ws really an amazing xperience,,u never realise wn it moves and @ one point of time u r at the top of singapore :) ,try going in the evening after 7 to njoi the lightings of the city.u can buy tickets bundling up with few offers of hop on hop off or duck tours.",,,
,,Dont miss this.,4,,The view was spectacular and the shops in the flyer were surprisingly competitive with markets and shops in town. Don't be afraid to buy something here.,,,
,,A must do experience,4,,Go there early if you want a carriage all to yourself. We were lucky and scored a carriage all to ourselves. The view is great taking in views from all around.,,,
,,Worthwhile,4,,Had the carriage to ourselves. I'd like to repeat it again at night. Close to Marina Bay Sands. Cheap eats downstairs.,,,
,,fun experience. excellent view.,5,,I had planned to go on the Singapore Flyer prior to landing in Singapore. We had a lot of fun in our own private capsule. It felt really steady and wasn't scary at all. Just remember if you want to book meals or drinks you have to do that at least one day in advance.,,,
,,Flying High,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is ""a must try"" while in Singapore. Unlike other Flyers it's so spacious n relaxing inside. Moreover it gives a spectacular view of the Marina Bay and the surrounding area. It moves so slowly n surely that you don't even realize it is spinning at all. The view below will keep you so enthralled that you don't even know it has come to a standstill n that you have to step out. It's a very enjoyable ride n well worth your money. Go for it!",,,
,,Skypark is better when it comes to observing,3,,"Even though Singapore flyers is the biggest observation wheel in the whole of Singapore where you can see the places around Marina Bay, I believe it's still better to view it on the Skypark. Height-wise, the Singapore flyer is shorter. Nothing special can be seen on the wheel. Just your usual bird's eye view of Marina Bay. It's also a bit expensive for just a view of the city for 30 minutes.

Nevertheless, it's a must-see because it's a Singapore trademark.",,,
,,"Fun, but dirty.",3,,"I went up at night-time, so the city view was great. The interior of the cabin was pretty dirty though. I was scared to touch anything. It would be better if they washed the glass too - I could have taken better photos.",,,
,,Spectacular Views with no queues!,5,,"We had been to London and had avoided the London Eye because we didn't like the queues.. well, my husband is not a queue fan! Singapore Flyer is larger and has spectacular views without the long cues and is well worth putting on your tour itinerary.",,,
,,Great view - heavily priced,3,,"Same outfit as the London Eye and the Australian version in Brisbane. This one has the option of having a dining experience. Costly. View is wonderful, but then the same as to be had from the SkyPark and the Cable cars that go to Sentosa Island - both of which are preferable to me.",,,
,,Worth a ride,3,,A scenic view of Singapore including Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay. The CBD backdrop was lovely as well. Too slow and can be quite boring and tiring after a while. There could be a complimentary drink offered with every ride.,,,
,,First ride and second ride..then inuf.,4,,"U must try it when u r in Singapore,at least twice,in the day and at night,u will have both of experience that totally different I went twice already and I think inuf for the next 3 years :p",,,
,,"Good for the view, but not much value otherwise",3,,The half-hour ride and the views of the city and the Marina during the trip are good. But there is little else value that I got during my experience during the afternoon. I suppose a lot of add-ons could be done to make the trip more exciting. Even simple things like a commentary that points out landmarks and notable places that one can see during different phases of the ride could make it a more memorable experience.,,,
,,Worth a visit.,4,,The Flyer is worth a visit; the views are certainly impressive and you can see both Malaysia and Indonesia on a clear day. I would advise going for the basic flight or champagne flight over the high tea.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,The Flyer has large compartments which are comfortably air conditioned. Breath taking views. Just be sure to go on a clear day.,,,
,,Good View,4,,"We visited the flyer in the afternoon and the sky was quite hazy, so the view was limited. Must try the flyer at night. Even the cost is quite expensive (33 SGD), but it's absolutely one thing to do at least once while in Singapore. Seeing Singapore from the sky....",,,
,,Up in the Sky,5,,Worth the wait and a lovely view from up the top. Gift shop is a bit of a let down but apart from that a great place to visit.,,,
,,Top of the world,5,,"Singapore was in the worst of the air pollution from Sumatran forest fires during this stay, so we headed for indoor attractions. The flyer was on our list (and free with our SIA stopover holiday). The whole circuit took 30 minutes, there were bench seats in the capsule, but we spent most of the journey bobbing from one window to another to look at different views of the city. We could see to the port and Sentosa, and in theory to the beginning of Malaysia, but this was prevented by the haze. We got great views of the Gardens By the Bay which we had visited the previous day, and it was lovely to see them from this different perspective. There were displays as you entered the Flyer complex to illustrate the design and construction of the Flyer, which were interesting. The wider complex also has a range of shops and restaurants as well as a local style food court. We got here using the SIA hop on/off bus.
We discovered by accident that the Flyer is just a short walk from the new Museum of Art and Science across the helix bridge.",,,
,,great way to see singapore,4,,I was on a stopover with my 4yo in singapore and she really loved the flyer (following the aqua duck ride you can purchase in one) A great way to relax after a hot day of sight seeing and just take things in from above.,,,
,,Afraid of heights,5,,I am afraid of heights so this was a challenge for me. It was worth it and I had as much fun as I did on the London eye. It was amazing to see the extent of growth in Singapore,,,
,,Singapore Flyer - Sky Dining,4,,"My husband surprised me at our 6th wedding anniversary with the unforgettable Sky Dining at Singapore Flyer.

The panoramic view of Marina Bay Sands bathed in the setting sun welcomed us. The lounge access is exclusive, making the whole Sky Dining experience very VIP-like. We relaxed and chilled out at the lounge until our dining capsule was ready for express boarding. No queue - how cool!

We shared the capsules with 3 other couples, but it was still very private compared to having dinner in a restaurant. And not to mention, the view was to die for.

The food was alright, not quite for the gourmet critic, but very filling. We dined through two rotations, which was about approximately an hour. It was very romantic and view was truly breathtaking, although this dinner was a bit too pricey - close to SGD$300!",,,
,,Breathatking View,5,,"You can see 3 countries (Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia) from the top of Singapore Flyer and it's really beautiful although it's a bit pricey",,,
,,Megan Sydney,2,,"I should not have comment on this as Haze problem was serious at that time, all outdoor activities were prohibited and limited.",,,
,,Great trip,5,,Great view in a slow pace - letting you explore singapore from different angles. The time (30 mins) passed way to quickly,,,
,,I like Singapore Flyer,5,,"it very tall 150 m high with Aircon, very smooth moving even you do not notice it moving. it is better you take it for night view, then you will see the light of the driven cars like the ocean of Golden are moving. pls try it.",,,
,,Breathtaking views,5,,"The ride, which is approximately 30 minutes, was enjoyable, presenting a good view of the city and surroundings ... the views being spectacular.",,,
,,Just another tourist trap,3,,"Singapore has magnificent skyline but there are better places to enjoy the view, preferably at night. I would rather check out some happening joints like ""Lantern"", ""Altitude"" or the like. The original ticket price for this tourist trap is just too exorbitant for a short ride. Try searching online for occasional deals that offer a discounted tour package including Singapore Flyer and Gardens by the Bay.",,,
,,"Great views, good way to spend and hour or 2",4,,"Easy access, comfortable and clean Flyer cars, nice views of the surrounding city. ""Army"" duck tours leave from here also, an enjoyable hour. Both flyer and duck experience seemed reasonable value (June 2013 SGD33 per adult for each experience) considering the simple enjoyment, clean location and helpful staff.
A bit of a challenge to get a return taxi on our trip...but close to major roads to hail a taxi anyway.",,,
,,Nice attraction,5,,Flyer is must visit attraction in Singapore. I do reccomend to take it in a first day so you will get an impression about city and can plan your future visits of other sightseens. Good photos are guarateed.,,,
,,view from sky,5,,The flyer is worth seeing. an excellent view from the top. well maintained and safe. the view of the scenery is excellent from the wheel. you can see all round the place. Not to be missed,,,
,,This is a great way to take in Singapore,4,,"While visiting any city there is always a fast pace of rushing around catching trains, cabs and walking to the next site. this will make you pause and take it all in during your 30 minute revolution. the capsules are filled with only a few people so the views will be great and you will have an opportunity to take some great photo's.",,,
,,Great views,5,,My kids loved their ride on the Flyer. The views were amazing and it travelled nice and slowly and was a very pleasant ride.,,,
,,Good way to see the whole city,4,,We went there with small kids and it was a good way to see the whole city quickly and easily. We took loads of photos and the kids were easily contained and entertained for 15 minutes. You can sit down or stand up. The lines weren't too bad either. I would recommend it if you want a great view of a beautiful city. We walked across the bay to the marina sands for lunch which was easy and beautiful.,,,
,,not so great,3,,Their is much hype about this attraction but I find nothing great about it. It gives entire view of city from top but really expensive 30$ for a person. Speed very slow. Same as Londoneye may be bit taller.,,,
,,Nice,4,,The Flyer takes about 20 mins to complete one round and I did the round in the evening so the Golf Course and Swissotel were looking nice. you could spot a lot of famous buildings as well.,,,
,,"Good view of the city from up above, friendly staff",4,,The Singapore Flyer and the Flight (Simulator) Experience are in the same complex as well as the Ultimate Drive. Lots of eating options in the building. Not much rush at this time. Very nice view from up above. They take photos that you can buy 1 for $20 or 6 for $60.,,,
,,Wonderful views even with the haze,5,,The Flyer is great and efficiently run and you do get great views. What was not in their control was the Indonesian smoke haze that plagued Singapore in late June. Even so a great experience a must do if on Singapore.,,,
,,You can afford to Miss it...,3,,"Just a giant observatory wheel. Not worth the cost. Yeah but you can view the whole Singapore from there. Best time to visit is around 6:30-6:45. You can view part of it in ""dusky light"" and part of it in flashing night lights of the city. But if find it costly, you totally have me as a supporter and will advise you to skip it. If you have a tight schedule then use the time somewhere else.",,,
,,Do this at night,3,,We did this during the day. I think it would be more majestic if it was done at night as the view would be enhanced by the city lights.,,,
,,get hiiigh!,3,,"tallest in the world, this is impressive! I was expecting a great view, but this one is crazy! you have time to think about how small you are, and how the hell human managed to build this entire city so fast, in the middle of developing countries! really nice to chill up there, and take time away from the nasi lemak and other chicken rice.. ;-)",,,
,,Good start to Singas,4,,"Good fun, great photo opportunities, great views , a bit overpriced but its good fun. Don't listen to taxi drivers offering to get you discounts check it out yourself.",,,
,,Just an average experience..!,3,,"Ok. So I spent close to 30 SGD for getting onto this giant wheel. At the entrance, there are some demos and displays giving information about the Flyer. The whole spin takes a half hour or so...and in that time, you can view all the places surrounding the wheel from inside your glass enclosure - which holds anywhere 8 people at a time. It's good at night, all the bright lights way below makes it a bit interesting. I was there on last New Year's eve, so the fireworks nearby generated oohs aahs inside my enclosure. Other than that, there is nothing that's attractive about this ""attraction"". This ride should have been FREE. ;-)",,,
,,Take a sunset trip...,5,,It was Breathtaking beauty from the start! If u take the MRT its a bit confusing getting there due to some construction taking place. Also check out the hawker style street food like cafeteria.,,,
,,SG Flyer,4,,"Very high, one cabin is like a bedroom in a hotel.
A cabin can be filled with around 10 person, sometimes with out family/friends, and sometimes we joined cabin with strangers.
We can see the F1 track from up above, also, we can see SENTOSA island(a little) from above, we can see Sands too!",,,
,,Great night views & free on Singapore stopover package!,5,,"We went at night when it was quiet & could appreciate the light show. You get a great view of the city. Admission is free with the Singapore stopover package that our travel agent had booked & can easily be reached on the Hop-on bus (also free as part of the package).
Well recommended.",,,
,,A cool spot to view the city,4,,"If you鈥檙e looking for a viewing platform to see the city from above, choose the novelty of the largest Observation Wheel in the world over a terrace on a tall building. There is more than enough time to see the buildings and pose for pictures and barely any sensation of moving until suddenly you realise you are in line with or above the skyscrapers surrounding you. It鈥檚 at the very least a pleasantly air-conditioned place to sit for half an hour.",,,
,,"Amazing views of the entire city,",4,,"Amazing views of the entire city, you can see the ports, the F1 tracks, the highrise buildings. We went around 6:30pm, if you plan to take pictures, then I suggest going earlier.",,,
,,"Up, up and away",4,,"Those of you who鈥檝e travelled on the London Eye will know what to expect because the Sing. Flyer works in exactly the same way. The wheel never stops turning: it just slows down sufficiently to allow patrons to hop on and off. And it moves at the same barely discernible speed as the L.E.

Walking to the ride starting point, you鈥檒l pass various displays and other paraphernalia about the history of the wheel, but I ignored it all. You鈥檒l also be asked to pose for a photo that you can buy later.

A rotation takes 30 minutes at a slow, leisurely pace enabling you to see the view from all angles and all heights up to the highest point of about 160m above the ground. The whole operation functions efficiently and runs like clockwork. Friendly staff are on hand to assist you every step of the way. The pods are large and comfortable. You can sit or stand or walk around. There is no commentary, except an announcement when you reach the highest point.

You鈥檒l see mostly tall buildings, some interesting architecture, highways, lots of cars on the highways, but this being Singapore, it all seems to flow smoothly. And right below you is the Sing. River.

As only a second time visitor to Singapore, and never having done it before, I felt that this was a fairly essential item on my tourist鈥檚 agenda. The flyer itself is the centrepiece of a restaurant and shopping complex which may be useful if you鈥檝e got kids in tow and they start getting hungry, because the location is slightly isolated being a few km out of town with little else in the near vicinity. But as a solo traveller, I didn鈥檛 bother availing myself of any of the facilities because there is so much more variety in the way of food offerings in the city.

At the end of the ride, you鈥檒l be funnelled 鈥?of course - into the souvenir shop and the photo display where you can buy your photo if you wish; that鈥檚 the one they force you to pose for before you head up to the ride. What a pain all that is.

I bought my tickets online and paid a reasonable $S26 for a single ride.

All in all a pleasant experience. Unfortunately for me, it started to cloud over as we began our ascent and a light shower spoiled things a bit but nevertheless I鈥檓 glad that I did it.

It鈥檚 easy to get here on the MRT train. Just hop off at Promenade station on the circle line and lookup at the sky and follow your nose.",,,
,,Worth a try,4,,I booked this attraction weeks before the hazy condition happened but during the day we where fortunate that sky started to clear and it was a n awesome view from the top.take lots of good photos and you don't need to buy the photos in the gift shops.There is security check upon entry and people assigned in the area hardly speak English ....this experience took 30 minutes and one thing there is no commentary so you pretty much guess which part of city you are facing.Overall great place to view the city..,,,
,,Good if you like a relaxing look at city view,4,,"At about 拢18 per person its not a cheap way to spend half an hour but if you like a good view its worth the money.

Busiest in the evening, we went late afternoon when there was a five minute queue and then only 6 of us in a pod. We were able to peacefully relax in the air conditioning and get some good photos of the CBD and quay. Lighting, etc was being set up for the F1 GP below which added to the excitement!

If you like the London Eye and aren't put off by the cost or heights then give it a go. There are certain tours where you can get a good price by combining the Flyer with other things so if you plan on doing bus tours etc research the best deal first.",,,
,,"Apart from the Marina Bay, you will not get a better view of Singapore",5,,Bit pricey... Worked out at about 拢30 which is fine for singles/couples. Would work out to be quite expensive for families though. We went at night and the views were breathtaking!,,,
,,Great view!,4,,Understand it is the tallest big wheel in world. The view is spectacular - over the city - the new inner harbour and out to sea the ships queue to enter Singapore harbour ( one every 8 minutes!) Great experience - well worth it!,,,
,,Awesome aerial view,4,,Spacious cabin that is not overcrowded allows you to move around and take snaps. This 30 mins ride gets over even before we realise it. Beautiful setup to capture the aerial view of Singapore from different angles.,,,
,,Biggest and best,5,,This is the biggest Ferris wheel in the world! Well worth a visit. We got in free due to a stop over deal coupon from Singapore airlines. Great views from the wheel. Truly an engineering marvel. Do not miss.,,,
,,Just a another observation Wheel!!,2,,Ya Its huge in size.but its too slow. You can view almost whole Singapore.I don't think it worth $33 or even $29(online). You can visit once as a tourist but you can give a skip if you are running in tight schedule.,,,
,,flyer,5,,Was a tremendous experience and really couldn't fault it. It is well organised. You need to do it on a very clear day.,,,
,,bird's eye view of singapore from up above!,5,,"two years when the singapore flyer had been inaugurated,I was fornute enough to visit singapore and also go for a ride atop.
first time experience was an exhilaration and total bliss.as the carriage moved higher and higher,very slowly paced,I could see the diminishing size of objects.a definite advice is to go it during sunset time,so that the city of singapore is best enjoyed to its fullest.the entire skyline is aglow and the city lights up and by then I was already at a 45 degree incline.forty five more to go to the zenith.
one must be there in person to go thru the experience.",,,
,,Great for views,4,,"Even though it was hazy, the view form Singapore flyer didn't disappoint all of us. This was actually my first time to ride a ferris wheel, and it was a wonderful experience. View, facilities, service were all great. Great for kids too, they'd feel like they're on top of the world!",,,
,,Great Views,4,,"I went on a clear day before the haze set in from the forest fires in Indonesia, the views were really good and it was a very tranqual experience. Although it was Saturday the ride was not busy and each cabin only had 4-8 people in it. Good value.",,,
,,Do it for free with a SIA stopover package,3,,"We had a 24 hour stopover in Singapore and booked the Singapore airlines package stay which included tons of free vouchers, including the Singapore Flyer. The views over Marina Bay and the new gardens by the Bay are great from up here and include good views of Marina Bay Sands and its Skypark but not sure I would have wanted to pay $33 for the experience. They did not overfill the carriages (unlike many wheels) so there was plenty of space to move about and look and take pictures or sit down and it was a slow - 25 minute or so rotation - so lots of opportunities to absorb the scenery. The food court at the base was also good - most plates around $4-$5 and good hawker style food (again we had free $5 vouchers so made it even better!)",,,
,,Highly recommend to do this at night,5,,Loved it. Recommend doing this at night. Got great photos. Great or all ages. Gives a great overview of the city of Singapore. Takes about 30-40minutes for a round trip,,,
,,Amazing City View!,4,,"We were there on a hazy day, so we couldn't clearly see the landscapes below from the cabin of the flyer. However, it was indeed an amazing experience flying so high in the sky. Hazy pics of the tall buildings was all we could manage to click. Anyways, it was not such a bad experience.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,3,,I don't enjoy flyers I find that I am bored after 10 minutes and want to get off - nowhere to go have to stay there,,,
,,great views before the smog arrived,4,,"great way to view the city , efficiently run and before you know it its all over. It was nice to return to Singapore after a 8 year absence and have the flier there.",,,
,,Over priced and a bit boring.,2,,My children (agreed 13 and 11) visited the flyer on a recent Singapore stop over. We were all disappointed by the experience as it definitely did not live up to the hype. In fact we were all quite bored. The air conditioning was the best thing about the trip. Unfortunately this caused so much condensation on the glass walls of the capsule that you couldn't see out. A ticket for the three of us cost $78. An absolute rip off. Cannot recommend.,,,
,,It is very high,5,,This is the highest wheel in the world it tops the London eye by a few metres i did the flyer twice once at night and also durin g the day was totally impressed Singapore skyline something to take in,,,
,,Stunning views - A must do!,5,,The flyer was by far my favourite experience when we went to Singapore. It wasn't boring at all! It seemed to go so fast as we took in all the views and took heaps of great photos. My mum has a severe fear of heights but we urged her to go on and she gave in. She was so happy she did too as she loved it! The views are breathtaking and you will get some awesome photos and memories to last a lifetime!,,,
,,Singapore Skyline,2,,SIN Skyline does not have so much to see for 30 to 40 mins. London Eye is far better as it has lots to see. Recommend to visit Singapore Flyer at night to see Singapore lite at night,,,
,,Great views,5,,Great views. Get there early in the morning to beat the tour group rush. Gift shop was under construction.,,,
,,On Top of the World,5,,EVEN Singapore Flyer is worth an experience loooking upon the beauty of SIngapore. The best time to board the flyer is around 6 pm when the sun is about to set and the lights of singapore is about to lit.,,,
,,"""TOP"" time",5,,"Really well managed attraction.

The location gives you the ability to see a little bit of Singapore as well if you choose to go by MRT.

We went with 2 families and the space available inside the capsules is fantastic.
The views are brilliant.
We went by day.",,,
,,A GOOD EXPERIENCE MUST TRY!,5,,You have to visit this when you go to Singapore because you can see the whole of they city from here. The cool thing is that when you reach the top the capsule turns and you don't even notice. YOU CAN TAKE REALLY GOOD PICTURES FROM HERE.,,,
,,What a View!!,5,,"This was one of the best outings while at Singapore. Its well organized and the view is one of the best, especially after the London Eye ride. It happens tobe the largest giant wheel too!",,,
,,Great views!,4,,"Wow what views, a little pricey but well worth it. Easy to get too. Best time is at dusk as the lights come on in the area.",,,
,,Bring something to entertain yourself,3,,"Nothing much I can say. This is definitely something you must do first time in Singapore, but beware, it turns super boring after the first minute and you will hope the people around you are interesting enough to watch. The ride takes probably 25 mins. Please note I took the ride during the daytime.",,,
,,The Giant Wheel..,5,,"Its not the regular giant wheel you think of, its in the shape of an egg and takes approximately 30 to 40 minutes for one rotation. You can have a complete 360 degree view of Singapore city. You can also dine in by pre booking it. Never miss it.",,,
,,Birds View,5,,Its an amazing experience of viewing entire Singapore like a bird. The arrangements are wonderful and the flyer moves with a lot of grace. So don't miss it!,,,
,,View from the sky,3,,"Ostensibly inspired by the London Eye (made marginally higher to have the upper hand in record books :), this offers an opportunity to take a look at the main attractions from the top. The views are good but are more or less similar to what you can get from Marina Bay Sands skypark. This however offers a 360 deg vista and on a clear day is worth the painstakingly slow revolution. There is a small self guided tour before you take the rideexplaining the origin s of the flyer and a look at similar structures the world over.",,,
,,Lovely view. Bit expensive but loved it,4,,"Great view of the city.. yes, you could get a *similar* view from a high floor of a hotel but a.) you'd have to pay for that too and b.) it wouldn't be as unique an experience as this!

Some of the people who have given this bad reviews say they're scared of heights.. well DUH! Don't go if you have a fear of heights! And to those who say it was slow and boring.. did you not read the info before going? It clearly says on the website that each ride is 30 mins.. Know what you're getting into before you go! This should be common sense for anything you do, especially when on vacation.

Anyway.. it was airconditioned in the pod and it was clean and well maintained. We went just before sunset and there was practically no line. The pods can hold 28 people but we only had about 10 (my boyfriend and I and a family with some children). It was totally enjoyable and something you'll never experience from a hotel... or really from anywhere else as this has a unique view and is the largest ferris wheel in the world..

Before you go in, there is an informative, interactive walkway (we didn't have time to truly soak it in as we wanted to make sure we got on the flyer for sunset). On the ground floor there is a rainforest area as well as a food court with some GREAT food. After this, take a walk over to the Gardens by the Bay super trees (go at 7:45 or 8:45pm for the awesome light show then go to the Marina Bay Sands boardwalk at 9:30 or 11 for the water show.. there are earlier time slots too)

Well worth it.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer rocks big time!,5,,"Definitely a Singapore must. Spectacular views allowing me to record film and take heaps of photos. Reasonably accessible to bus or Rafles or City Hall MRT stations. Plenty of food, drink and toilet options near by (remember this is the hot tropics so keep fluid intake high if required). At $33 SGD per adult it is not cheap but still worth it. The ride takes 30 mins and if you fly Singapore Airlines and present your used boarding pass then it can get you a 20% discount. I visited during the day and it was fantastic - I have heard the night trip could be even better. Highly recommended for all ages. Will consider doing it again!",,,
,,Zzzzz.........,1,,"What a bore. The great thing about say the London Eye is that there are actually landmarks to spot on the way up and down. Singapore does not have these icon and historic buildings to look out for. If your idea of fun is going very slowly round in a circle looking at not a lot then go ahead.

If you are going for the view and photo opportunities, best to keep your money (its not cheap for what it is) and head to Ku De Ta at the top of Marina Bay Sands. The money you saved on not going on the Flyer can be used to buy a refreshing drink and you get much better views and much better photos.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"See lot's of stuff when you're at the top. Prices are reasonable, wait times aren't too bad. Cabins are well maintained and air-conditioned",,,
,,"Excellent experience, worth the money.",5,,"Visited the flyer one night around the time the sun was setting and the scenic views of Singapore were amazing and well worth the money. It was very quiet when we visited so the visit was very peaceful and enjoyable, I would recommend this.",,,
,,Another breathtaking view of Singapore City beside Marina Bay Sky Park!,3,,The ticket of $33 was way too expensive for a 35 minutes ride (one rotation). A splendid view over city's skyscraper especially in the evening.,,,
,,A relaxing ride with a gorgeous with of the Singapore skyline.,5,,"Now that it's hazy around Singapore, I'm reminiscing about the clear blue skies and the pretty fantastic Singapore Skyline, which can be clearly seen from the leisurely half an hour ride.

Count your blessings if you're lucky enough to be in a pod alone with your loved ones--you'll have more chances to roam around the pod and enjoy the 360 degree view.",,,
,,"A great view of Singapore, whatever the weather!",4,,"The view was great, obviously, although the haze was starting sadly so it wasn't that clear, we were still glad to have done this while we were only in Singapore for a few days.",,,
,,Fab views of the City and Grand Prix Start line,5,,"One not to miss if you want to see the City and Harbour sites. Fabulous way to see this City and must be extra special at night.

A great way to see the Grand Prix Circuit start line if you feel like seeing it from the comfort of airconditioned pods rather than walking around in the sweltering heat of June !!!",,,
,,breathtaking views,4,,"Although a bit costly but views are breathtakingly beautiful. Not for ride lovers but only for aerial views of Singapore City, River and Harbour.",,,
,,First and Only One in Singapore,4,,"Quite nice for 30 Mins ride. If you guys only have half day , maybe can give it a visit coz the surrounding area have another attractions and good spots for taking photo.",,,
,,Nice and relaxing,5,,"I was there with a business colleague just few days before the last Formula One Grand Prix, on a professional assignment. Before leaving the complex to go back to the hotel we decided to take a trip in the Flyer. It was just before sunset/dusk. We started the turn while still talking about what we had been working on during the day, but soon we were distracted by the many birds that played on the moving structure. Then it turned dark pretty quickly and the sight of the lighting of the F-1 circuit below was awesome. We could also see the laser projections on the walls of the Sand Tower complex and, of course, the lights of the business area. We were dazzled by the views and since we were in the cabin on our own (no crowds at that time of the day, curiously) we could move freely around it to see the city鈥檚 skyline in all directions. It was a very nice and relaxing experience. In fact, hadn鈥檛 we had a dinner booking together with other people, we would have done another turn! BTW, despite the overall satisfaction, I found the ticket price a little expensive. Sorry, the photos are not great.",,,
,,Flyer in Singapore,5,,"We thought we would like to go to the Singapore flyer this day in Singapore and I am so glad we did as I wasn't to keen on going on this big wheel. Well I did go on it and gee I am glad that I did as it is a wonderful experience to do .The views were fabulous and the carriages are big and spaces so there is plenty of room for all to see and the best part is the great photo's you get from up at the top.
You will not be dissapointed to go this and also very easy to get to using the great Singapores transport system. They know how to move the people .",,,
,,Expensive,4,,Make sure the weather is good or you won't see to much. I thought it was a little pricey for only one trip around,,,
,,Singapore flier,5,,Best flier to see the city. Its a slow moving ride. So slow that you can hardly feel the movement. Some people would reserve a whole cable car and eat there! How amazing.,,,
,,Good views nothing more,3,,"I had been twice on the SG Flyer. It is a tourist type of attraction. Worth riding once. It gives a good view of the city. Tourists may find it interesting that such a construction can be made & well maintained but it isn't very interesting other than the great views. After a couple of days of stay in Singapore, you can try this attraction. You will be able to relate the places you visited by looking from the top. Definitely pricey.
Maybe the operator should consider giving some discounts\ family packages to attract more visitors. If many tourists are travelling, there is a possibility that they may avoid the attraction considering the cumulative cost.
First visit was a day before Christmas & I ended up waiting for almost 2 hours before entering the chamber. The other was on an afternoon on a weekday & there was NO queue. So, choose the day & time of visit to avoid queuing.

Overall: Pricey but worth a visit.",,,
,,Nice ride but bad view,4,,Was a good smooth ride but the view was spoiled by the haze enveloping Singapore due to the forest fires in Indonesia every year around these couple of months.( June & July). Was amazed at the engineering marvel behind the flyer.,,,
,,Good company makes it bearable,3,,"The flyer ride is about twice as long as i would have liked, the view from the top of the ride is great and expansive, a monsoon shower had cleared the air so we could see for a long way, definately a ""onecer"" trip, good company and conversation made the ride bearable but i wouldnt be lining up for another trip anytime soon",,,
,,Worth the money,5,,"No queues and relatively cheap, about 拢15. Views when we went were great but I guess that depends whether the smoke from the Indonesian fires is present. I don't particularly like heights but felt perfectly ok on this. Apparently this is a few metres higher than the London Eye which we haven't been on so can't compare the views.",,,
,,Finest views of Singapore skyline.,5,,A half hour ride with very nice view of the entire city of Singapore. As good as the London Eye. We went an hour before the closing time. The queue was not long and we went in the capsule after 10 minutes. The ride is a bit slow for kids but mine were peaceful as the views are captivating even for kids.,,,

,,Go up at sunset!,5,,We went up just as the sun went down and watched the light come up throughout the city. It looks amazing from up there! the gardens by the bay light up in such a pretty way! The city is huge and stretches on as far as the eye can see!,,,
,,Great overall view of Singapore,4,,"This is a thing to do in Singapore to get a good idea of the urban planning of Singapore and where is what from ground up. Most people say its best to go about 6pm where sunset is just about to begin so you get a day and night view from the flyer capsule. The duration of the ""flight"" might sound a bit long initially but when you are in the capsule it goes by fast as there are a lot of views to take in. After the flight there is a good food court downstairs to tuck into very affordable local food. The quality and price is decent in the food court and its a great place to begin your Singapore Hawker food journey.",,,
,,Wonderful day in Singapore,5,,"Seen Marina bay area and almost all of Singapore with ""Singapore Flyer"" most amazing scenery, from the heights we could see the beautiful modern building with an artistic arrangement.",,,
,,interesting...,4,,"nice to do, we went in the morning, so less crowd. but I guess it's good to do in the evenning,so you will see lots of lights view.",,,
,,A great experience,5,,"A breathtaking view from the top of this wheel. The gondolas were quite large and it was like being in an aircraft, there being no sense of moving. The displays you had to walk through before boarding were also entertaining and informative.",,,
,,Provides bird view of the city,4,,"Located near MRT station, about a 10 min walk. Good time to visit is a sunny day. It's about a 30 min very slow ride. Excellent place to take photos. Gives a good view of the city.",,,
,,Feel Like you are flying,5,,"One of the best attraction in Singapore - I suggest to visit Flyer in the night so that you would be able to see the full lighting effect of Singapore city. The ticket cost is nearly 20S$, But it worth spending that amount.

Singapore flyer is connected with the metro station Promenade, just walkable distance from that MRT",,,
,,City lights via the Flyer,5,,"We were so happy we did the Flyer in the night time and got to see the lights of Singapore from a different perspective. Its more than just a ride, the walk up to the cabins has interactive displays.
Try taking your photo at the light show on the wall, the pictures came out so cool.
The Flyer is so clean, the staff simply amazing and helpful but the best thing were the views.
My advice is get there about 6.30 as dusk turns to night and see the lights blazing away, magical for keen photographers.",,,
,,A unique experience.,4,,"It was a unique experience, and one which I would recommend to those traveling to Singapore. I believe there are only two of these in the world - the other being in London. The Singapore flyer is larger than London's.

The view was wonderful. You get a grand view of the harbor with its hundreds of ships, plus all the buildings and tourist spots on the waterfront.

It's certainly a marvelous use of technology. The flyer goes around once every half an hour, revolving slowly. The cabins are quite spacious and provide a 360-degree view.

The high-tea was fine, but nothing great.

Plenty of parking. Easily accessible by MRT subway train.

It's something a tourist in Singapore should do. Having said that, I can't see myself doing it again, because it would be the same experience.",,,
,,Great Concept,3,,"Very good concept, but was totally noring during the day, maybe better at night though. The wheel turns slowly but you see great sights all around.has a dinner carriage, children's party, I think even a wedding carriage.

The food when you get off is Fantastic probably the best part of the whole trip for le.",,,
,,Awesome experience to be moving along a giant wheel,3,,"Awesome experience to be moving along a giant wheel. Cost 33 SGD per person but is a treat for all who enjoy scenic beauty. Gives a 360 degree view of singapopres city with emphasis on the city centre. You can view the marina bay, the F1 pit and tracks, the flyovers,opera and all across singapore. Must do for all",,,
,,Awesome Views,5,,"We went on the Singapore Flyer just before sunset The views were simply amazing to see the skyline of the sun setting over Singapore city,This is definitely a must attraction to anyone visiting singapore",,,
,,Worth a ride,5,,"Similar to the london eye, this is a must do in Singapore. Best time to visit is just before sunset as u can see the city in natural light and then completely lit up",,,
,,Another wonder in Singapore,5,,"Just awesome this was. Singapore is a very beautiful city so just having to see it from up top is magical. Be sure to check it out, hopefully earlier in the day when its not too crowded, and a day where the weather is good! The entire ride was about 30 mins if I remember correctly. A little pricy but worth it!",,,
,,Superb Experience,5,,"Superb Experience....Bigger than LONDON Eye,...Complete View of whole city...Contains with 28 Capsules....Compulsory recommend for the visitors....the price was 32$...but i paid to my guide for 30$..Many more special capsules were available,,,,",,,
,,A tourist thing to do but a bit expensive,3,,Views are good but I found that for a family of 4 it cost $99.00 and my kids said it took too long -1/2 an hour to go round,,,
,,"Singapore's ""London Eye""",5,,"Something a visitor must check out while visiting Singapore, the flyer moves at a slow pace which gives you enough time to see the surrounding area from a height.",,,
,,Flyer - great view but 30 minutes passes by fast,4,,"Found the view excellent..did not have to wait in line as most reviews mentioned (had booked & printed my tickets in advanced)
Was not allowed to carry any food along (understandable) ..but then they do not have any place to store your stuff while on the ride.

overall a must do ..and advice focusing on the ride than just taking pictures..the 30 minutes passes like a breeze",,,
,,Clean and easy,4,,"God view nice sized cabins, easy access..staff is friendly..how ever no commentary or visuals is a bit dampner .. I think London eye is much better than this. None the less its a must do at Singapore.",,,
,,Wheelie Good,4,,"Rotated at a nice steady pace, probably best done on clear day to get the best views. Did as part of the Hippo 2 day ticket offer, which made for great value.",,,
,,"""Beautiful Merry go round""",5,,"Nice example of engineering can be experience while watching Singapore flyer & enjoyong the ride. While lot of people has said that it is slow & you will be stuck for about one hour but we enjoyed the ride a lot. It actually started raining when we boarded the flyer. The flyer started moving. Only my family was there inside the flyer & we thoroughly enjoyed viewing Marina Bay, Tall buildings, Marina Bay sand & other structure of Singapore city. When we were half way then rain stopped & the view was more clear. It was good decision that I decided to board this along with my family.",,,
,,Great way to see the whole of Singapore all at the same time,5,,"I really enjoyed seeing the wonderful view of Singapore in the Singapore flyer. It's a must try for all the visitors of Singapore. It has a spectacular view from above. Beware to those who has fear of heights because its really,really very high. But over-all, it was a great experience",,,
,,Good way to see nice views of Singapore,4,,"It is the biggest Wheel in the world, but the view is nice and nothing more. I would recommend to visit Singapore Flyer after sunset to see illumination.",,,
,,Superb View from the Flyer,5,,"Had been to Singapore in month of May 2013 and went to the Flyer in the afternoon on a sunny day on 4th May. Sky was clear and we had really good time in the Flyer. There was not much of a crowd. Once you enter, you can spent some time in the museum where in they have displayed the mechanism behind the Flyer and how it operates.
Flyer moves with very slow spped and once you go at the top, you can get the entire view of Singapore, especially the Marina Bay view and ""Manhattan"" skyline of commercial buildings.
The tickets for family of 2 adults and one child is 78 SD.
We were surprised to see in the next day's newspaper the article about the discounted rates (almost half the price) for all the attractions in Singapore. The Travel agents can get the tickets in discounted rates and they are selling it at the malls.
Anyway, Would like to experince the view in the night also, maybe next time!",,,
,,"Lovely Journey, Poor Destination",3,,"The flyer itself gives great views of the city and is a thrill ride - not for those that don't appreciate being propelled from skyscrapers or trusting their lives to a few inches of cable.

The two destinations were probably wonderful if you have deep pockets. We were in Singapore on a fairly tight budget, so unable to appreciate these.

The 'Best Toilet in the World' is worth a visit",,,
,,Worth a Spin,4,,Went on the Flyer around sunset and saw some spectacular views of the city. There are a lot of informational displays and exhibits in the waiting area so I can imagine it gets really busy at certain times. Not sure that I'd wait hours in line for a ride but we did not have to wait at all so that was good. The price was less than the London eye and the views perhaps a bit better. Worth a visit.,,,
,,Fantastic view but pricey,5,,"The ride was slow, about 30 minutes for a whole round. Being that it wasn't crowded, 3 of us were in a capsule with 3 other guests, although it would have been nice if we could have the capsule all to ourselves.

We did see the capsule ahead of us with special sittings where a couple had the capsule to themselves, drinking wine and earing strawberries.

The capsule behind us appeared to look like it would be something for a kid's birthday party.

The weather was nice so our view was fantastic but a little slow in our opinion, would have preferred 2 rounds at a slightly faster pace for the price. Similar to the London Eye, but I would still recommend if you are in Singapore just to experience it once.

Don't forget to check out the coffee shop (food court) with a nostalgic flair at the basement.",,,
,,A great view of the city,4,,If you have done London Eye already then this is not recommended. This is an exact replica and is overpriced. If you have not done London Eye before you can try this. The ride in the evening is nice with lights everywhere. I found the views of the London Eye better.,,,
,,Pricey but worth it for the experience.,4,,Largest ferris wheel in the world. It was always going to be a pricey tourist trap but overall I think it was worth it for unrivalled views of the bay and skyline.,,,
,,Wheely wheely good! (I'm sorry - couldn't help myself! :),5,,"Outstanding views of Singapore's skyline, attractions, suburbs, rivers, ocean etc. A definite must do! Definitely worth the $$'s.",,,
,,boring,2,,"1 hour (or 30min, forgot) was far too long. the best part was the view, and even that got old after 10min. and my friend needed the bathroom quite badly.",,,
,,Excellent!!,5,,"A must do if you are in Singpore!! Excellent....well worth the $30 for 30 minutes. They did not pack us in like sardines so we had lots of room to take pictures. If you go during the day (as we did), make sure it's a bright, sunny day for the best views. Don't forget your camera for sure! I would imagine the night view is also fantastic. The 'Journey of Dreams' didn't look too appealing so we skipped it. The line up can appear long but it does go fairly quickly. Would recommend that you go first thing when it opens to avoid the lineups. We were there about 10:30AM and the tour groups were coming in then. To get to the Flyer, use the MRT (Promenade Station) and it's a few minutes walk from there.",,,
,,Going Around Slowly,4,,"Weather seems less hazy in the afternoon, better view. If you are a Senior take care that you do not purchase tickets from the travel agent office to the right of the main entrance, 9SD can be saved by wandering through the complex to the 2 windows run by the flyer situated on the lower level.",,,
,,Worth the view,4,,I went on the Singapore flyer just when it was getting dark on a June night. I'm not normally one for tall heights but it moves so slow and smooth it was no problem. The views of the city and outlying area were great. There was only about a 5 minute wait once I bought my ticket and one rotation takes about 30 minutes. The price was a bit high (about $23.00 USD). You are in a capsule that's totally enclosed with 360 degree views. You are with about 10-15 others and there is a bench in the center if you want to relax. There is plenty to do in the area in terms of eating and drinking. It is also a stop on the duck/hippo tour. I would visit this attraction if you have the time.,,,
,,Visit at sunset or the evening.,4,,A must do for the views. We went in the evening the views were excellent. We travelled to it from our accommodation on Clark Quay using the MRT. I certainly would use it again if visiting the area.,,,
,,The big wheel,4,,"We went at night hoping to see the laser display on the harbour. Saw a bit. Was good to see all the lights at night, was a different feel from the day. Was a bit expensive, been there - tick.",,,
,,wow,5,,"London Eye.. the same co. has built this, the first thing we landed in Singapore our first visit was to flyer; its about 45 mts watching the entire city view - rocking experience. They organize dinner in the night but let me tell you will thoroughly enjoy the entire ride just superb and kudos to the city.",,,
,,Amazing view of the city,5,,"Try to get to the Singapore Flyer at night! You get gorgeous views at night as compared to in the day. The round trip is 30-45minutes, i didn't really count but it's worth it!

If you are a tourist in Singapore and have nothing to do at night i would recommend for you to drop by the Singapore Flyer and take it!",,,
,,Stopover in Singapore,5,,Unforgettable memories. Spectacular views. Family trip. Adrenalin. Worlds largest wheel. Dinner with beautiful city view. Landmark. Fun. Love it!,,,
,,Beautiful attraction with stunning views.,5,,A must do in Singapore. The souvenirs shop was still under construction but the lounge and surrounds are amazing,,,
,,Great views - worth a visit,4,,Good value tickets. Worth the try. Eateries were empty - dont know why - like a ghost town so we decided not to eat here.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"The flyer is set is lovely little grounds, with plants, koi fish ponds etc., great views over the City, special prices for children and over 60",,,
,,Must See while in Singapore,5,,"This is a great attraction. It is a large Ferris Wheel with large glass enclosures. It continually runs. It affords you a opportunity to take plenty of photos and site see at the same time. It is close to down town and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Casino.
I am really glad I took the time to experience the Flyer.",,,
,,Pay for a VIP trip,5,,"Been on the flyer many times, and each time I pay for a ViP package as you get to ride in a better furnished cabin. Also get a drink such as singapore sling for the journey too :-) you also get a presentation champagne flute too forgoing on a VIP package.....oh and no queuing to board either",,,
,,Excellent VFM,5,,"Great views of Singapore, Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Bay Sands. Takes 30mins, no queue but went mid morning. Excellent value fora memorable experience and lots of great photos.",,,
,,Memorable experience - well organised.,4,,Our group of three very much enjoyed this slick operation and the meal was surprisingly good given the logistics of service on the Singapore Flyer itself. Well worth doing and if I/we visit Singapore again I would be likely to do it again. Just be aware your drinks ( a little expensive they are too) are on top of your tickets for meal & ride on the Flyer !,,,
,,Great views of the Singapore skyline,5,,I went to Singapore in Jun 2013 and visited the Singapore Flyer on the second day. It is the biggest Wheel in the world and you could see for miles around. The sunset view at around 6-7pm is wonderful. I can't recommend it more.,,,
,,Do not miss this!,5,,"We went on the Flyer at night which was a breathtaking way to see the city. There was a disabled member of our party, which we never told the staff as we able to help him on board, but the staff noticed and when it was time to get off they slowed the wheel almost to a stop to help us get him off. All this without us asking them which shows their consideration to their customers. Well Done!

The wheel takes around 35 mins to do a revolution and you should chose a clear day or preferably night for maximum viewing",,,
,,Amazing views!,5,,"My fiance and I visited the singapore flyer whilst on a trip to see if we were interested in moving to Singapore. It was fantastic, the views really are great from here. You can see out over the city and also over the Singapore Strait. We're both F1 fans and were surprised to see the F1 paddock and starting grid tucked right behind it (we hadn't done our research!) of course we went down to see this afterwards. We're now living in Singapore and I would love to have another go at night.",,,
,,What a delight,5,,"Step into the Journey of Dreams at Singapore Flyer, and be delighted by the magnificent view it provides. It is a 30 min ride which provides glimpses of Malaysia and Indonesia. Well, this is the world's largest observation wheel and worth a try. Ticket costs around 33 SGD.",,,
,,Great way to see Singapore,5,,"My partner and I went to the flyer with me having done the London Eye, my partner not having experienced it before. It was entertaining to see a wedding party get in the car in front of us and get married on route. The circuit was great, fantastic views across Singapore, particularly marina bay gardens where we had spent the morning. Well worth the experience.",,,
,,Wow!,5,,"To get the best view of the Singapore skyline, head to the flyer

On a sunny day you really will get the best view of Singapore, and it's well worth the visit

(At $33 SD's (拢18ish) it is a little pricey, but you can get a discount if you buy as part of the open top bus tour)",,,
,,Beautiful,4,,"Just so nice to see the city and its marvel from up there, no wonder it's one of the most popular attractions in the city, from up there you can see some of the most beautiful attractions the city has to offer, and from there you can get a perspective of how big the city is. Hint, is not big.",,,
,,Been on one wheel!,3,,"Have now been on London, York and Singapore and one other I cannot remember! This is fine enough but I read recently that the company behind it is going bust. Views great, F1 track etc, $30 bucks - money could have been better spent. Sorry just not my thing! No more wheels.",,,
,,Great view!,5,,"if you came to Singapore it something you must try, great view if you on top and the speed is slow ""No worry"". It is definitely worth a visit.",,,
,,"Well worth a ""spin""",5,,A great way to see Singapore and surrounds. Roomy gondolas that you can walk around in. Clear sides.,,,
,,Better than I thought,4,,"The price is a bit of a shock but there is a cool little entry that my son enjoyed and the veiws are amazing we did this on our first day which is a good way to work out what sights you want to see.
It is also next to the F1 track which my partner and son thought was very cool",,,
,,Wonderful Experience!,5,,"My husband and I went here for our one-year anniversary. The city of Singapore is absolutely beautiful, and it was breathtaking to see the night city-line from the top of this ride. The wheel moves so slowly you barely feel like you are moving.",,,
,,Worth a visit,4,,"It was a good experience, nice views of Singapore for a thirty minute ride. I would only do it once and perhaps thats why its not booming. Nice not to have to queue for long.",,,
,,Champagne & Chocolates aboard the Singapore Flyer,5,,"Singapore by day is amazing. Singapore by night, viewed atop the Singapore flyer while sipping champagne in a semi-private capsule, is spectacular.

The Champagne & Chocolates package is absolutely worth every penny if you prefer a much smaller crowd than the 28-person capsule capacity. The special VIP capsule has a more glitzy ambiance, complete with cushioned benches, subdued lighting, and of course, a flute of Moet & Chandon Champagne served with chocolate covered strawberries.

When my husband and I rode the flyer, there was only one other couple in the cabin, and they stayed pretty much in a corner and were hardly noticeable while we were there. The whole rotation takes about 30 minutes, enough time to take in the views and take a bunch of photos of the city skyline.

Highly recommended.",,,
,,"""Ferris wheel""",4,,"Wow! I love parks just the way everyone does. This big flyer, I call ""Ferris wheel"". It looks exactly the same. Please come to this place. Escpecially if you are been recommended to.",,,
,,Flying High on the Singapore Flyer,5,,Fabulous experience - great way to take Singapore in without the humidity! My mum is scared of heights and was a little unsure but once it was over she wanted to do it all again! Must do before leaving Singapore!,,,
,,Awesome views from the Flyer,4,,Although I am not comfortable with heights (terrified) - I did enjoy this experience and the panoramic views of the city and the harbour. There were not too many people in queue so no waiting and minimum number in our pod. The pod was large and comfortable with seating and air-con. It does move much faster than the London Eye but still plenty of time to see all directions. The information and school science promotions along the entrance tunnel were enjoyable. Well worth the price for the experience.,,,
,,Great way to get views of the City,4,,Great way to see the City and the surrounding coastline. It was not crowded. With the heat it was a great way to cool off in the air conditioned pods.,,,
,,A Giant Ferris Wheel,5,,You can't get as better view of Singapore unless you pay to go to the top of the Sands hotel and Casino. It gets a little scary but you will remember the ride forever.,,,
,,"Great View of Singapore, A Must Do!",4,,"This was the first attraction we visited in Singapore and it was a good choice; a great way to see the city. The admission fee for adults is S$33 and children, S$21. We were taken through the history of Singapore and the making of the Flyer in a darkroom gallery where we took photos with light plays. On the Flyer, we could see innovative architectures, Marina Bay and the River with the cruises moving along. The capsules or passenger cars are Huge! at roughly 300sq-ft and it moves very slow, for about 45 minutes. So, you don't need to worry about motion sickness and I believe it can help anyone with fear of heights, making their fear more manageable. The ride truly gets you used to the height and more comfortable as time passes. This was also great for professional and leisure photography of the city view and buildings... The night view is also beautiful. In addition, you can book the capsules for romantic dinner or parties. There is also a garden and pond below the wheel where you can feed fishes and take a short, light walk and appreciate the ambiance. In the same area, you can purchase tour and attraction passes at the many companies available. There are also restaurants like the Bayview Tandoor and Popeyes and kiosks selling fruits, bites and souvenirs.",,,
,,fun ride!,4,,a must try! you get to see a panoramic view of singapore. best to ride on a sunny day. even at night when city lights are up. thrilling experience!,,,
,,"Pretty interesting but expensive, and overall ""meh""",3,,"About $100 for 2 adults and 2 kids is pretty steep for a 15 minute or so ride -- but the views are pretty cool, you get to see many of the major landmarks and get a great appreciation for how the city is laid out and of course its mulitcultural makeup.",,,
,,Scarey,5,,Scary but thrilling Great view of harbour Quite expensive but has to be done and beats the bus or tram,,,
,,Singapore Sling Flight,5,,"I did the Singapore Sling Flight, which was great. Costs a bit more because of the cocktail and service, but I think it's worth it.

Waited in their lounge before the flight and was assisted to the cabin by a friendly staff member. Was lucky to be by myself in the cabin, as I was the only one at that time slot.

I could see Singapore and take great pictures.

Would defined reccomand it!",,,
,,Wonderful experience,5,,"Can see the entire singapore , good experience , will be good if you can go in the evening, not so long queue",,,
,,Wow,5,,"To be so high up in the air, to see the ships in the bay, the amount of high rise buildings was unbelievable, you just don't see from the ground the amount of hi rises.",,,
,,My First Flyer,3,,"So I decided to bite the bullet and pay for an attraction! I went on a Monday morning, and was the only person in the capsule - great! I basically went to take photos, but unfortunately these did not turn out well, as the windows were tinted, and also quite dirty. I also did not have a lens hood with me so I got a lot of reflections. Anyway, it was nice to get a birds eye view of Singapore, but next time I'll do it at night. One thing which really confused me was the compass rose on the ceiling of the capsule (photo attached) - when facing the compass I think that east and west are in the wrong position",,,
,,Amazing Up There!!,5,,"Nothing like the Paris Wheels we grew up with!! Quite a experience, they say you could almost see Indonesia from up there. Its very safe, very well organised, air-coned.
We went earlier to get some snacks and a beer at O'Leary's Sports Bar below the wheel, a great place too!!
Come early , there's always a queue but it moves very quickly due to the competent management!!
Then of course afterwards they have a stand that sells photos of you!! beside the souvenir shop.
This is a must Attraction in Singapore!! Enjoy!",,,
,,Flying Tim,5,,"The tallest Flyer in the world is amazing. For first-timers in Singapore It may be a good idea to do it during day time when u will be able to see lot of attractions far far away, Marina Bay Sands, City skyline, Golf course, Gardens by the Bay, Raffles sqaure etc etc. Each Pod accomodates around 15pax and each ride is around 30min. The exhibit before taking the flyer is also quite interesting with info while constructing the flyer etc. The Garden below the Flyer is also Amazing. There are lot of good eateries around ticket counters. Must try Juice land for wide range of juices and shakes at reasonable prices",,,
,,Awesome views of the city,4,,Another must-see in Singapore. It doesn't cost very much and the ride lasts close to 30 minutes. Try to go at night so you can see the city light up.,,,
,,Nice Views,3,,"The view is nice and gives you a good look at the city, harbour area and the Marina Bay Sands. It takes about 30mins to go around and the map supplied was quite big and difficult to use. I suspect that you could probably see the same view (if not better) from on top of the Marina Bay Sands.",,,
,,SINGAPORE FLYER,3,,"Though this is rated as an icon of Singapore, and one of the top tourist attractions in Singapore, reckon this is over-rated. There are many places in Singapore that provides wonderful high altitude view of the city. Many of them are FREE! The price is also high; as this is about twice for entry to the sky park in Marina Sands, which provides much better views. Moreover, one can move around to get different views of the city; if the weather turns bad, one can easily find shelter, and enjoy the views again when weather turns fine. Make sure you clear your bladder before entering the cab! The public transport system to the attraction is not too convenient.",,,
,,Awesome attraction,5,,The views from the Singapore Flyer are astounding and we would recommend the Flyer as almost a compulsory attraction to do. Wheelchair friendly and children would love it too. Great photo shoots - unbelievable views.,,,
,,Awesome Views of the City!,5,,"A must do while in Singapore. It takes all of 30 minutes to complete. Once you're at the very top, you can see practically the entire country!",,,
,,Worth it,5,,It's something you have to do if you come to Singapore. We went at night and it was such an amazing view of the city! Worth the money.,,,
,,Nice experience,4,,The view is really nice... though nothing extraordinary if you have already visited the tall buildings in the city.,,,
,,Must do,5,,"If there is one thing you do in Singapore, you must do this. You got the best view of the city, and the boats all out at sea.",,,
,,Great way to see the city,4,,"What a fantastic way to see the city. Make it there on a clear day and you will see all the odd and beautiful buildings of Singapore. Gardens by the Bay are a short walk from the Flyer and a must, straight after.",,,
,,Great views over Singapore,4,,"A great way to get a panoramic view of Singapore is a ride on this giant wheel - good on a clear sunny day, or at night when the city is light up. If going at night, try to leave about 7.30pm so that you are at the top of the wheel when the light show is on at Gardens by the Bay.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"What a lovely walk to the flyer and lovely gardens to look around too. The views from the top are great: you can see Indonisia on a clear day. Air conditioned pods with plenty of space. We didn't queue either which was a bonus. Well worth doing if you are in SIN,",,,
,,Quite the experience!,4,,"So, I will admit that I did not actually take a whirl around the wheel; however, I did visit the site and wish that I had time to do so. The wheel moves quite slowly, so you shouldn't have any worries about motion sickness or vertigo, and it's MASSIVE! So, I imagine the views are SPECTACULAR! I would CERTAINLY recommend making a trip if you find yourself in Singapore....DEFINITELY worth it!",,,
,,great view on Singapore,5,,"excellent view, nice & easy going as the rotation speed is slow, at some peaktimes the waiting line can be quite long,",,,
,,Breathtaking Romantic Dinner on the Flyer,5,,"During a family visit to Singapore our children gave my wife and I dinner for two on the Flyer. The dinner was five star with four beautiful courses along with a very busy young waitress who made sure we were comfortable, our wine glasses were full and that we always had plenty to eat. The Flyer does just 2 very slow revolutions durning the 1 hour dinner and you would not know you were moving, anyone who is afraid of heights has no need to worry as it is not a scary ride. Wine is prepurchased and brought to your table as needed. Not much in the affordable range from the wine list but the shiraz I picked (A$75) was excellent. There were just four couples in our huge capsule so we were well spread out and this made for a very intimate experience.",,,
,,Good views from on high,4,,"The trip on the Singapore Flyer wasn't quite as exciting as I thought it would be but it was good never-the-less. Checking for the ""flight"" was done smoothly and within a few minutes we were in our assigned pod with four others and away we went. Overcast skies prevented us from see too far but what we did get to see - the harbour and city was great.",,,
,,amazing views,4,,the views from the flyer were amazing and the trip around offered you plenty of time to take heaps of pictures of the surrounding sites. Highly recommended.,,,
,,Not a bad experience,3,,"Went on the flyer during a warm sunny day, so we got a good view of the surroundings. Not much to see though, except for the Gardens by the bay that looked really pretty, and the sea. Couldn't really see the neighbouring islands of Malaysia and Indonesia as advertised, but it wasn't a bad experience. We had fun exploring the shops on the levels below the flyer. There's also this great Indian restaurant called Bayview Tandoor with a nice view of the sea to look at while eating.",,,
,,very nice - but only when the air is clear,5,,"Take the ride before sunset, so you could see both in day-light, and at night all the city lights.Take the ride only when the air is clear. Near by there a big shopping center.",,,
,,Astounding views,5,,"The Singapore flyer is a merry-go-round of a huge diameter which rotates very slowly and offers astounding view from its glass paned windows. It is definitely worth a visit. Very close to it, a yellow and a black Lamborghini's are parked which can be self driven on paid basis.",,,
,,Great views of city marred by unfriendly entry and exit staff,4,,"The Singapore flyer is a must visit for any tourist like myself. I am from india and was visiting the flyer with my daughter. At the entrance a lady had some problems scanning my ticket so she asked me whether it was just an ""ordinary"" trip. Anyways, I assumed it could have been her way of finding out if there were any food/drinks also included. Next we went through the security and show displays and that was good. The staff at the entry to the flyer pod were very courteous. There was hardly any waiting time. Great views of Singapore , must see from the flyer. Just magnificent. At the exit shop I wanted to browse a few souvenir shirts for my family but was sternly told by the lady manager to browse only the ones in the first row, which did not have all varieties and did not interest me. The junior sales lady was however very professional. So basically I was not given a chance to purchase any shirts and collected only the photo souvenir and paid for it. So basically a mixed experience with the flyer. Will not revisit again.",,,
,,The Singapore Flyer,4,,The Singapore Flyer is located near the shore of Singapore's Marina Bay. It is the world's tallest Giant Observation Ferris wheel. The height of the Ferris is 165 Meter. It is one of the prominent tourist attraction in Singapore. It is worth a visit if you are planning a trip to Singapore.,,,
,,360 degree view of Singapore,5,,You can view almost the entire singapore from the flyer. Nice experience to view the city from a moving tablet like structure.,,,
,,Awesome view..Tallest Ferris Wheel in the World!,5,,"Last week was my second trip with my best friend, she request to visit singapore flyer. So, i searching all the information about Singapore flyer. The price is not cheap, for adult SGD33, if you buy ticket online will get 10% discount. At April 2013, there are promotion where we can get 20% discount if we buy ticket online, so we bought it online. We came here at 6.00 pm but the sky are still bright so we decide to wait 30 minutes by walking around under the ferris. There are so many restourant here, no need to worry about food. We not try to eat here.
At 6.30 pm, we decide to enter the singapore flyer. We got free attraction, which name is ""journey of dream"", before we enter the capsule of singapore flyer. When we enter the capsule, we can see everything around the ferris from above, such as Garden by the bay, Museum art science, Helix bridge, Marina bay Sands, f1 race way, beautiful night light from the building around, the crowded street,etc. And Yes, it was wonderfull,,,awesome! There are 8 persons in one capsule, not to crowded that day. The movement of the Ferris is cannot feels, that suddenly we are on toP, then we go down. Its go very slowly but its fun. The ride is Around 30 minutes. So, enjoy every seconds in the Ferris and capture all with your eyes then save in your memory! :)

The best time to visit: 6.30pm
To go here: take a circle line MRT train to promenade station exit A, then walk about 10 minutes.
Opening hours: 8.30 am -10.30 pm
Price: adult 33 sgd, child 21 SGD, senior 24 SGD",,,
,,great views,4,,i took a ride on this in a nice clear sunny day so great views over singapore. the pods have air con so no worrys about all that glass.,,,
,,Bad weather ruined the views,3,,"We were unlucky enough to have a really rainy night when we went up which really ruined the views, the windows were steaming up and covered in drizzle so the visibility was really bad. However, in good weather I think the views would be more impressive. It was still enjoyable and the views were pretty good. I thought it was a bit overpriced though to be honest.
We also went up at night because we wanted the night view and it was very pretty just a bit expensive for what it was.",,,
,,Summer Vacation with Family,4,,It has an amazing view you need to go in the evening 5.30 pm so as to get both view (Day & Night). If the sky is clear you can see the city and looks beautiful.,,,
,,"View from the top, amazing experience",4,,"Great service, we got special pass to jump the queue for having a disabled person in the group, and less crowded car. Transport getting out is not easy. Limited taxi rank nearby.",,,
,,Not amazing,3,,"Better you take if the light already on and the sky already dark, so you can see the city lights. Don't go take on rainy day. You will not see much. In clear night, you can see batam lights from here. Ask for family package.",,,
,,Lucky it was free,2,,"The hotel that I stayed have this package with a free ride to the Singapore Flyer for 2 person. I would say that the ride was horrible and boring. They allow alot of people in one of the capsule and it really smells bad due to sweat in the hot afternoon. The ventilation is really bad.

As my title says, lucky it was free. And even if it is free, I will definitely not take a second ride.",,,
,,Awesome Experience!!,5,,Very interesting. I love this place. Great view from above. There are various restaurant on the locations.,,,
,,Peaceful and Beautiful Singapore,5,,"A wonderful and excited experience I may never forget.
Great attitude of personnel and I would definitely recommend this experience to anyone who seeks a great time in the sky with his family and friends.
Singapore is very clean, tidy and quit country I have ever been. People are very friendly and helpful.",,,
,,awesome,5,,although scared of heights I really enjoyed the flyer. the views are fantastic and the ride was very smooth. do not miss this its fantastic.,,,
,,Best way to see Singapore,4,,"It offers a great view of Singapore If you don't have too much time to see Singapore, this should be top of your list.",,,
,,a view of singapore,4,,actually i am afraid of heights but i still continue on the whole ride it almost took 45 mins and went i reach the ground i immdiately ran to the toliet and vomited,,,
,,Gives youa real perspective of the city and island,5,,Well worth the money (if you are 60+ be sure to claim your discount). And have lunch at the market-place of food stalls below - excellent food (we ate from the indian stall) and beer at very reasonable prices.,,,
,,Good views and very well run.,4,,"I really enjoyed this. Peaceful and a good chance to take in the whole city from all angles.

Note that not everyone gets a seat, so if you want a seat, let other people go ahead of you if it is busy and wait to be first into the car.",,,
,,Great view of Singapore,5,,"As this is our second visit on the flyer, my husband and I were a bit anxious as we didn't enjoy our first trip that much. It was crowded and did not smell good.

This time around, however, my family had a capsule all to ourselves. We were a party of 6 and my kids enjoyed seeing most of Singapore from up high. We were able to ride after waiting for an hour due to the suspension of operations because of rain. It was so nice to just soak in the sights and marvel at the manmade wonder of it all.

There is a taxi stand at the base of the flyer and we were lucky to get a new luxury car of German make take us back to our hotel.",,,
,,"Nice view, but not cheap",3,,"It was a lovely afternoon at the Singapore Flyer. It is definitely not a cheap. The view on top of the sands hotel is most probably better because you can take photos at your leasure. The 30 minute ride is short and it is not easy to take photos. Worth seeing the view but if you want a more slow going photo session, go to the top of the Sands Hotel.",,,
,,Super fun,5,,I went on the Singapore Flyer today. It was really fun. Saw all of Singapore. It was a very smooth ride.,,,
,,30 minutes in the air,3,,We were thinking twice on whether to splurge money for the 5 of us on this attraction. Decided it had to be done. Views were breathtaking from up there. We did the ride just towards the end of sunset. I was looking forward to getting some beautiful pictures from up there but sadly the glass was pretty dirty. The little LED lights they have in and on every capsule creates a very prominent reflection off the capsule glass and hence makes a lot of the pictures unusable. You probably need the necessary accessories for your camera to avoid this.,,,
,,S$33 for 30 mins of view,4,,"For a local, I felt it is a bit expensive. The walk from the ticketing office to the cabin is a long 10 mins, which is a problem for the elderly. The view is great but not fantastic. It could use some narrator (recording) , so the ride could be more informative and educational.
For the tourist, if you can afford, go for it.. Bring along your camera. After the ride, have your meals just beneath the wheels for some local food. Then, take a stroll along the bay outside.",,,
,,One of the best night scenary venues of Singapore ....,3,,Approx. S$50 for 1 rotation of 30 minutes on Singapore Flyers ... offering one of the best night scenery of Singapore ... Pretty costly .... and believe that there are cheaper alternatives of comparable views/scenary,,,
,,Top for orientating & seeing water!,5,,"Nearly didn't go due to short time in Singapore.... Went today.... sun shining, views amazing sooooo worth the time, money very coool! Not to be missed",,,
,,Must see views to die for,5,,"I was totally amazed at the size of the flyer ,What they put in to go up is so roomy you can walk around to see different views .You dont even feel it moving wow.I felt so comfortable inside & no worries about hights",,,
,,Giant wheel which takes 30 minutes for a round,4,,"Amount of walking one has to do among various distractions to reach the flyer is phenominal, they have created photo ops and ofcourse they click your picture and sell it for a grand price as souvenir.
Getting in and out of the flyer is as it moves, so one needs to be careful. due to this factor it is not possible to load more than 10 people.
Once you are in it you can freak out taking pictures of the city from various heights. just in 30 minutes your flyer adventure is over",,,
,,"Expensive, touristy but... Enjoyable!",3,,"It's essentially a must do if time permits however, should you need to choose, Marina Bay Skypark provides a slightly better view of the Singapore cityscape for slightly less of an entry fee. The full rotation of the Flyer takes about 30 minutes and will provide AMPLE photo opportunities for the snap happy.",,,
,,DEFINATELY need to go on this,5,,"Loved this experience, the visibility was amazingly clear, and was a really good way to gain orientation early on in our visit.
The Singapore flyer is the largest observation wheel in the world......and the biggest bonus (but don't know if this is usual) is that we walked straight on!
No lining up in horrendously long queues like the London wheel.
The experience takes 30 minutes to complete, and moves very gently and slowly. We were very fortunate to only have 4 other people in our pod (they hold up to 28 people).
Ticket cost for adult was S$33, or can be pre purchased online to gain a discount.
This really was one of the highlights of our stay in Singapore.",,,
,,Didn't blow me away,3,,"I do not usually go for Ferris Wheels no matter how big they are. I think that once you get up in one then you're stuck there for sometime.

Singapore Flyer had never been on my list of things to do whenever in Singapore but on the last trip I was looking for the river cruise counter and stumbled upon the thing instead, and so I thought I gave it a try.

For a popular attraction, lines moved along quite quickly. It is a well-organized business with plenty of staff on hand to guide and assist. There was the requisite photo-taking pose (chargeable if you want it at the end of the ride). The location is quite good, within walking distance from an MRT station and not really in a busy area. In fact, the only eating/shopping outlets are right there at its base, which is good for convenience but bad for choices.

The Singapore Flyer cabin itself was okay but not that great. Mine had about 15 people. There was a group that went there just to talk to each other (loudly), so that was really annoying. Anyhow, the evening view was good but not as spectacular as I had hoped. I think from where the Flyer stood there was a view of the bay and newer developments but it just did not blow me away. To hamper the viewing, the cabin glass was dirty with smudges galore, making photography highly difficult. All the photos I took came out with subpar quality.

Singapore Flyer is good if you just want to ride a big Ferris Wheel but the experience in 30 minutes once you are up can be disappointing.",,,
,,WOW,5,,"This is an amazing way to take in the view of Singapore! Loved it. Slightly scary seeing little children leaning up against the clear glass walls, but that was just my nerves! Loved it!",,,
,,Singapore Flyer was an amazing experience,5,,"Every tourist in Singapore must visit Singapore Flyer , its just a very different experience .
You can see all the sky scrapers and ocean which is truly Mind blowing .

Some Tips :
1. Check weather forecast before going . Avoid on rainy days
2. Go on a weekday so that you dont have to wait in a long queue
3. 6 D motion ride just next to Flyer is also worth",,,
,,Views to the end of the earth,5,,"The views are something to be believed, truly you feel like you re looking down on worker human ants! The design, engineering are mind blowing. There is also a very clean doctor fish spa located here service good",,,
,,"Great views, bad weather can shut it down",4,,"We went on the flyer, it was a great view, recommend to anyone. Easy to get on and off. Capsule was of good size, seemed larger than London. They put a small amount of people in each capsule, so it does not feel crowded. It was a good way to get a sense of the city and how it is laid out. We walked there, it does not have enough signs posted on the walking route, but you can see it from everywhere, so that helps you find it.

However, the first day we went storms came in about a second after we bought our tickets and by the time we walked up 1 flight of stairs to the boarding area, they had shut the Flyer down due to weather. Of course they should have known that at the ticket booth. We were not sure on our schedule, so instead of just keeping the tickets and hoping to get back there as the clerk suggested, we asked very firmly and got a refund. Signs are posted ""no refunds"" so we expected to be out of luck, but they listened to reason and gave us our money back.",,,
,,Dining experience,1,,"The concept and experience is terrific however recommend you DON'T do the dining experience. Grossly overpriced and the food would be better at MacDonalds. Served just tepid steak that was dry, tasteless and tough. Had one mouthful. A complaint was met with 'OK'. Total disinterest . Could have been a real money earner but quality and service lets,it down.",,,
,,"If you miss it, you miss Singapore!!!",5,,"This is one of the nice attraction and it gives you beautiful view of entire marina bay sands and surroundings.Flyer is the one of the most attractive things to do in singapore. Even childrens can enjoy this flyers as It moves very slowly.You can see all around the city beautifully. No need to walk long distances from bus parking, it is conveniently located.
Only draw back is expensive tickets. after the flyer we had our indian food at the basement of theFlyer. No need to wait longer duration to get the seats. Becasuse of slow moving flyer children and older people also can get in and out easily. if you miss it you miss singapore.",,,
,,Somewhat interesting,3,,"A very touristy attraction to begin with, the view of the east coast and south beach areas are great, somewhat good for photo taking. Go on a good day since 50% of the time Singapore rains or when haze hits, you literally don't see anything.",,,
,,You must do this,5,,This is the tallest of its kind in the world and Singapore does this so well. Went up just before sunset and saw the sun go down and the views of all the lights coming on over Singapore. Not quite as high as all the skyscrapers but almost. Do not forget your camera. we had to borrow a friends to get some decent shots.,,,
,,Nice but alittle expensive,4,,This is lovely and memorable during our visit to Singapore. We went on the flyer to see the entire city and it was beautiful. It moves very slowly so you will get about 30 minutes altogether.,,,
,,Good view,5,,"This was a brilliant ride. We could see forever and it doesn't even feel like you are that high. Next time I would try it again, but at night.",,,
,,"Stunning view, but reflections a problem for night photos",4,,"I took the 7.30 champagne flight.and was well rewarded for the extra cost by having a capsule to myself. The view from the Flyer is stunning, but garish lighting in the capsule causes a high level of reflections.",,,
,,Great views,5,,The view was fantastic. Value for money. Only 2 other people in with us even though 28 people can fit in each. Very comfortable & like most places in Singapore very clean!,,,
,,amazing,5,,wonderful experience..we arrived earlyish and missed the crowds...only 4 others in the pod with us. fantastic views ..well worth the cost.,,,
,,A unique way to see Singapore麓s cityscape,5,,"During my recent visit to Singapore on a business trip, I thought that the best way to see the cityscape was from the world麓s largest observation wheel.
And it was a wisw decision. One full turn takes about half an hour. It peaks at the equivalent of over 40 stories high and the views are breathtaking.
Singapore is today a most modern city, wihere the architects have developed different high rising buildings and other awesome structures. This makes yhe sights from the Flyer even more interesting.
I went at midday but I have heard that at night it can be even more enjoyable.
I strongly recommend this attraction.
And since the F! Singapore race course is very close to the Flyer, remember to look for it when (if) you watch the car race on TV.",,,
,,nice,5,,glass of champagne and strawberries with chocolate was very nice part of the program orgnized for our group. Pleasant surprise before dinner with stunning views :),,,
,,This attraction is good but tickets are comparatively too much,4,,"This is one of the nice attraction and it gives 360 degree view and you can see lot many place from the top which is the best part of this attraction.

Its moves very slowly to you can see all around (east,west, north and south) at the same/any time.

Only draw back is expensive tickets.

Lots of food options are there. Tourist information and relax center is there, free buses for tourist and all are also available at the same place (downstairs)",,,
,,Different view in the middle of the water,5,,I liked the view at sunset time. Is very romantic and different. I just went from one side and would have like to have more time to explore it a little more. Will go next holidays.,,,
,,Great experience but very expensive,5,,"Went on a weekday afternoon when the crowd was lesser and thankfully weather was also great. Went with full family as the tagline of ""world's largest observation wheel"" seemed too good to miss. Overall experience was nice and took some good snaps but felt that the price was rather too expensive at 33$ per adult. Would advise travellers to buy some combo deals before going to save some money and consider this better value.",,,
,,Expensive but probably worth it,4,,"At $33 this is not a cheap thrill, but you get views of Singapore that you might otherwise only get by going to the top of the adjacent 'triple towers' .
It's better done than the London Eye, with shops and feederies around the site and informative/artistic displays as you enter your 'flight'. If you can, hang around until it loks like there are only a few of you for a bubble - you will get more room and better views that way.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Really enjoyed our time on the flyer, shared our capsule with another couple so had plenty of room to move about. You don't feel as though the flyer is moving and for anyone afraid of heights it wasn't a problem for my husband.",,,
,,Well worthwhile,5,,"Was fantastic! We took some great photos and were very lucky with the weather. We had a view of the Flyer from our hotel and noticed quite a few times that the visibility would have been very poor. Like most of the attractions in Singapore, we felt this was very good value.",,,
,,The perfect way to spend your evening,5,,Climb on during late evening and enjoy the vibrant colors of dusk. Perfectly situated to give a superb view of Singapore's marvel city and the surrounding water.,,,
,,Stunning,4,,Well it's bigger than the London Eye and the setting is a 100% better with a beautiful little garden to visit underneath. It's the attention to detail that I just love about every attraction in Singapore,,,
,,Excellent view,5,,Good food with delectable spread overlooking the splendid Marina Bay. And to have a dinner after a 40 minute aerial ride in the Flyer catching the beautiful night view of Singapore was truly awesome,,,
,,Skip it,2,,"Overrun with obnoxious people and kids. Way overpriced ($33) for basically a Ferris wheel ride. Too many pushy vendors, and you're forced to walk through a cheesy ""flight museum"" to get to the Flyer. Do something else instead.",,,
,,The slowest flight you'll ever take!,5,,"This is better than similar rides in Malaysia or London. You enter a posh glass cabin that floats into the sky bringing into view skyscrapers and a magnificent sight of the Singapore Bay. As you watch the ships slide past slowly distant islands come into view. We're told they belong to Malayasia and Indonesia. And as you descend you get a glimpse of the F1 track. Man, did that get my 2 boys excited! It lasts half an hour but this ride is totally worth it.",,,
,,"Great view, not cheap",4,,"The view at night was wonderful looking back towards the city centre and across to the Marina Bay Sands. Windows had a reasonable amount of condensation so not a perfect view from all angles. My ticket was part of a Singapore Airlines stopover, so great value for me, but not sure I'd pay full price.",,,
,,Nice for the city,4,,Nice little experience. But a bit pricy just to see Singapore of a higher view. Its definitely nice and worth a ride but personally I feel the experience of going to Marina Bay Sands and swimming or casino is far better. Just saying.,,,
,,45 minutes of spectacular,5,,"My husband recently visited the Singapore Flyer. We went on a Saturday afternoon. If I remember correctly it was about 30 US dollars per person. The Flyer operates by gravity, very cool! You go up in glass enclosed compartments that you walk on to while moving!! At first it is a little daunting but just take a quick step on and you will certainly enjoy the views! We were on with one other family so there were a total of 9 people. The space could have easily handled 20 people. There are ""special"" compartments but I saw them and they are not worth it. You can reserve them and have dinner inside them, the naugahide is peeling and remember it is only about 45 minutes.

The views are truly spectacular but sadly, you don't know what you are looking at. There are no handouts, no guides in the compartments and no recorded tour info playing on a loop (which I hope they incorporate!!)",,,
,,Consider combining with other attractions to save money.,5,,"Tickets for the Singapore Flyer were included in a package we purchased for the 3 day Hop On Hop Off Bus tour. It also came with tickets for the Duck Tour, a bumboat tour and more museums than we could use. All in all it was a great deal and was very convenient.

The Singapore Flyer would have been a tad expensive for what it is had we purchased tickets for this alone. We were there at 11 am ish on a Sunday in February had to queue for 10 - 15 minutes maximum. The views were spectacular and the ride was smooth.",,,
,,Amazing views,4,,Even when it was raining there was an amazing view around the city. Takes a little time but it is well worth it,,,
,,Not worth for the money,3,,"Just back from the Flyer. There is a lot to pay, Just to see the Marina from a 40 story building. Over-hyped marketing attracts and if you have time spend time on something else in Singapore.",,,
,,Pre-book your tickets,4,,"I had heard some horror stories about the amount of queuing involved at the Singapore Flyer, but I'm happy to report that if you pre-book and go during the day mid-week, you won't have any issues. There are a number of exhibits on display as you make your way to the observation wheel which are interesting and arty, but it wasn't clear to me what link they have with the wheel. Maybe I don't have the right kind of imagination.

On a clear, sunny day you can probably see for miles, but on this particular day it was hazy. I great experience, nonetheless, but if you're intending to go up to the top of Marina Bay Sands then there isn't much point in going on the Singapore Flyer, and vice versa. It's exactly the same view.",,,
,,a marvel of engineering,5,,"Although I am worried about heights, this was worth tamping down my fear. We had an entire capsule to ourselves so could move easily from one side to the other and enjoy the spectacular views. This was actually the first attraction we visited as it gave a good oversight of the many well planned and attract buildings in and around the city.",,,
,,Great views and Good Value,5,,Well worth it and very stable like the London Eye. Kids enjoyed it too. Could be combined with the Duck Tour.,,,
,,Moving view of the city,4,,"This is definitely worth a visit when in Singapore. It gives an amazing view of the Singapore landscape. Note that queues are usually long so be prepared for the wait until your turn. The day view is better than the night view, however if you are amazed by city lights then go at night rather. The size of the flyer itself isn't overwhelmingly large, but does have a marked presence in the skyline. Take advantage of photo opportunities when at the very top!",,,
,,A big wheel!,4,,"Trying to accomplish more things to do in a very short visit, I visited this magnificent wheel on an evening. It was brilliantly lit up with different colors. From the ground, the structure looks massive.
It wasn't as crowded as some other reviewers mentioned at the time because its the evening and most people are actually leaving. Unfortunately it was a bit wet so I wasn't able to get the best use of its view from the cubicles. But you do get a great view of Singapore's iconic skyline from here.
It is also very close to Promenade MRT station and is about 10-15 minute walk from there.
There is a small food court at the base where you can get something to eat. All these food stalls looks quite authentic but maybe not the food.",,,
,,SUCH a grand view,5,,"We couldnt decide whether to go at night of in the day. WE opted for day - we got a grand overview of the bay and lands and just the entire city

We combined out Singapore Flyer ride with the Indian tandoor buffet. This was it was so affordable.

I found the gift shop to be very pricey but that was to be expected.

The view was well worth the money, It made a slow 30 minute rotation so it was just the right amount of time spent here. I enjoyed the museum type displays they had before you actually went into the flyer.",,,
,,Great view of Singapore,4,,Worth taking the ride and for taking a look around Singapore. Try to do it around 5.45pm or so and you can get a great view,,,
,,The best in South East Asia so far,5,,"Very well organised and. queue can be long, and there is no ride if thunderstorm predicted. Sunset ride is the one I recommend, view approaching the top is very good for both city and Bay view, good photo opportunity for Marina Bay Sands complex. If one plans a special dinner/ or that proposal, a champagne/ dining cabin can be organised through travel agents (cheaper rate I found) or directly to the operator. There is no access during Grand Prix, reserved for GP guests only",,,
,,"Nice views, nothing incredible",3,,"I liked my visit to the flyer, but if you have already visited the city, gone up to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, and watched the city by day and by night, the Singapore Flyer won't add anything to your visit. I had been in the London-Eye a couple of days before, and I liked the English version much better.",,,
,,Nice attraction,4,,One of singapore's must visited attraction. Offering experience to see great view of the land. Really not recomended to batophobia. High ticket price. But.. there's nothing cheap attraction in Singapore.,,,
,,Worth a day visit,4,,we went by ourselves during the day and found it not busy and it gave us a great view of singapore. we had a cabin to ourselves as we were not part of a group - easy to get to by MRT,,,
,,Not that great a view,2,,I would rather recommend people to go for the Marina Bay Sands and avoid this altogether. The view from the flyer is at best partial and the landscape of Singapore city is hardly visible.,,,
,,Amazing view,4,,"Amazing bird's eye view of Singapore. We took the ride right before the sunset. The night view is just spetecular.

After the ride, we visited the Singapore Food Trail under the Flyer for dinner. It's a 1960s themed food street, in which you could try many famous Singapore street food in one go. A bit more expensive than normal food court but the food is so YUM!",,,
,,Great views,4,,We did this at night and it was really lovely - in hindsight I would encourage people to try for the sunset timeslot to get both day and night views. Of course it's so pretty in the evening with lights etc but would be better to see the city in the daylight as well. Very well managed and efficiently run but certainly it would be good to have a map of the city so you knew what you were seeing as well.,,,
,,good,4,,"Best to go at night, better view of the city, than during the day. Make sure to arrive 30 minutes before to get on the ride.",,,
,,fun for the kid,4,,"- great views across marina area including the new gardens by the bay and the ships in the channel
- includes a helpful 360 degree map within the cabin
- plenty of space and seating area for young and old alike
- Combined with the duck tour package for a better value combo (flyer tickets are valid for 30 days or longer from the day bought)",,,
,,Great Tourist Place,5,,"You can see the city light view of singapore city at night and in the day or afternoon, you can see the activities of this city. but the price was little bit expensive, that's why backpacker sometimes cannot come to enjoy this tourist attraction. the price of pictures and also the souvenirs were expensive. better maybe you gave the tourist best price to promote this attraction.",,,
,,great place with very great view,5,,this observation wheel was very nice. you can see the singapore city from the top. you can also get so much information about singapore and also about the working of the observation,,,
,,The best part of our trip,5,,"Wow. The views of Singapore were just Awesome.
We did not visit on the best day (overcast with some rain), nor at the best time (afternoon), but we were blown away by the sights.
We were lucky enough to have the pod to ourselves so the children did not annoy any others. There was plenty to see and the kids enjoyed it as much as we did.
At the beginning there is an interactive display about the flyer and Singapore through the ages. Unfortunately we did not get to spend enough time here due to time constraints (had to catch a flight home).
Would have liked an interactive commentary of some sort (there screens in the pod, but they did not display anything other than an ad).",,,
,,Spectacular night,5,,"Singapore Flyer is more than just a tourist spot.

My hubby surprised me for a night at the Singapore Flyer. At the beginning I expected it was gonna be like tourist activity. Turned out it was great and way better than I expected.

We had experienced the ""Champagne Flight"" in a private capsule. The capsule was huge and well decorated. I was flattered that we had our own capsule, we could enjoy the view quietly :'))

The capsule rotated one round and it spent 30 mins. I couldn't feel it was rotating actually. I was just bewitched by the beautiful skyline of Singapore.

We would consider to visit again. We tried at night this time, so we hope to try the day time version once :)",,,
,,Must do tourist attraction,5,,Good value for money if you do a combined Duck ticket that gets you food stamps for the Hawker food under the Flyer. Good for an orientation of the city and a photo opportunity,,,
,,Birds' Eye View - Singapore,5,,"Firstly, very ideally located.Right where all the Singapore tours operators congregate before setting off in all directions.This place also is your ones top shop for all kinds of excursions and sightseing in Singapore.Anyways the pier is Right behind the ticket office and fantastic way to Look over Singapore as it has 360 degree view within a 10 + seater Bean shaped glass capsule.Go before sunset and witness for yourself why Singapore is so special!",,,
,,Nice view over the city,4,,"I do not know if this is a MUST in Singapore but definitely interesting experience. It takes around 30 minutes on the Flyer. Nice view over the sea, port, Singapore River and the city.",,,
,,Great View,4,,Amazing view of the city. Suggest you do this just before sunset so you get to see both day and night views.,,,
,,Great view of the city,4,,"A must do in Singapore. The flyer takes about 30 minutes, and offers a great 360 degree view. Well worth the money when on holidays.",,,
,,Spectacular,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is nice and as similar to the alike in the world, it offers spectacular view to the marina area, and if view is clear, to very far distance of Singapore. A full rotation spans 30 minutes, and it is recommended to start the ride at around 6:30 (just before the sunset) that you can probably see the changing view from the golden sunset to the night jewels of the the city. Do spare some 15 minutes for the exhibits before the ride. There is package for the Flyer plus the Duck Tour (altogether 53 dollars) which one can tour around the marina area on land, water and the sky. They provide free shuttle between the Duck Tour start point and the Flyer.",,,
,,Great,5,,"This is huge, with the most fantastic views all over the city. Not too expensive either but you must like heights as its not for the faint hearted!",,,
,,Not Just a Ferris Wheel,5,,"We boarded the Singapore Flyer not expecting to be especially thrilled but seeing it as a way of escaping the heat and the bustle of Singapore for half an hour or so. We did, but it was much more than a refuge. It was an interesting and thoroughly enjoyable experience. It certainly gave us a birds eye view of the city in all of its aspects. At $25 Singapore dollars (give or take depending on your circumstances) I felt it was money well spent.",,,
,,An excellent afternoon!,5,,"We had a terrific time from start to finish and thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. From getting whisked to the front of the line and let into the flight lounge to await the ""all clear"" following the rainstorm, to having a capsule to ourselves, we could not have asked for a better tea or for more beautiful views of the city. Thank you to the staff, who were attentive, friendly, and hospitable, for making our afternoon tea so memorable.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"As expected, fabulous views over Singapore. It could use a map or similar so you could tell what is what when you are up there.
The 30 minute rotation doesn't sound like long until you are up there with 2 young children. It does provide plenty of photo opportunities however.",,,
,,Interesting views over Singapore but wouldn't do it again,4,,Very interesting ride great views over Singapore but a little boring after 15 minutes. Can't say much more than that,,,
,,Wonderful,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is well worth doing. We chose the time of sunset so that we can see the city in day light, see the sun set and night lights.",,,
,,great,5,,My husband and I had a hi tea on the Singapore flyer it was great well do it again next time we are in Singapore it was great value $ 99.00 for 2.,,,
,,Nice place,4,,"This is a great thing to do when you first arrive in Singapore to give you a comprehensive overview of this rapidly growing city. Singapore flyer is a very nice place to go and have look around Singapore, Singapore Bay, and Sea. There are numerous cafes and bars around the outside. Souvenir and photo shop.",,,
,,Good view but a bit pricey,4,,"Singapore Flyer can be viewed as similar to London Eye. The ticket may be a bit tad expensive considering S$30 for just half an hour ride. Having said it would be best if you want to spend some romantic time with your beloved (it is one of the popular proposing places in Singapore). We went there at night, which is recommended as you can get a bird's eye view of the whole illuminated centre area.

The Flyer is near to Esplanade and Marina Bay Sands as well so you can take a stroll around the area if you'd like. We had a fantastic view of Singapore by night when the wheel brought us up high in the space. It was a pity we didn't plan our dinner too as it would be a lovely experience.",,,
,,Great if you are not scared of heights.,4,,"This is a great attraction and well worth the money if you want a nice relaxing view of SIngapore from extraordinary heights. However if you are a little scared of heights, you may want to find a different spot to view the harbour from as the feeling of being suspended in the air in a capsule can be a little daunting at first. Once you reach the top of the circle, the views are amazing - there is no doubt. And as you feel the capsule slowly returning to earth, the feeling of trepidation disappears. It is probably easier to sit on the seats provided if you are queasy and don't look towards the inside of the wheel - look outside where you can't see the mechanics of the flyer.",,,
,,Great View,4,,Great view if you come near sunset the city light is very appealing..very romantic for honeymooners..first i thought it would be scary but it's not scary at all and i enjoy the rise,,,
,,"Up, Up, and Away",5,,"Having a fear of heights, I wasn't too excited about this attraction. However, my 12 year old's heart would have been broken had we not, so I mustered up and hopped aboard. It is dizzying looking up through the flyer while you are preparing to board, but once inside it was completely calming. The carriages are very large with surrounding windows and comfortable seating-if you can remove your face away from the window. We went around sunset, and once I stopped looking straight down, I began to appreciate the fantastic 360* views, I couldn't get enough. The passage of time is nearly perfect as we finished our complete loop, I was ready to get off. Remember to use the loo if you have the feeling as it does take a while for your return!",,,
,,Good views and good exhibition displays too,4,,"Good views over Singapore and well worth the price of just over $30. We found it fairly quiet, so no queuing, and only one other person in our capsule (which is large and could easily take 20). This also means that you don't need to book in advance, but can choose your day and time hopefully to get fairly clear weather. The flight itself takes around 30 minutes. There is a good exhibition about the construction of the flyer as you make your way to board, so if you can, allow time to look at this. This builds the expectation too. You should not miss this while in Singapore.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Gives you some perspective of the city, much like the London Eye. Good opportunity for a photo shoot. Worth a visit even if your afraid of heights!",,,
,,Similar to London Eye but better,5,,The tropical environment and the fact that it was built on uncluttered land means that it is ahead of London. Beautifully landscaped with shops and restaurants (and other ways of taking money off you) means that it wins. Also on all the on\off bus routes means it is easy to get to. A short walk from MRT. London Eye still worthwhile though.,,,
,,Great way to see the city,5,,A fantastic way to get a great view of the city. Good value for money. Make sure that the sky is clear,,,
,,I proposed my wife here,5,,"I was thinking about a special place to propose my wife.

I am bit boring so i want to do it at some nice dinner, but then what kind of restaurant would be special enough for the occassion?

I found that you can have dinner at the flyer. It's a bit pricey (set 3 course menu) but i think it's well worth it.

I had some difficulty finding the reception hall for those who take the dinner package. No clear signage for diners, which is weird for a place so meticulous as singapore.

I booked a time, and i certainly don't want to lose my slot since the event is very important for me.

Had to asked some employee, whom point us to an elevator lobby.

After we take the elevator, things becomes clearer. We were asked to wait. Didn't specify how long, just wait.

Then we are called, and all the previous inconvenience disappear. We love the view. The food is actually well made, i was expecting bad food typical for ""you pay for the view and experience"" type of venue, but no, food is well made. My (ex)fiancee had a great time and experience.

Getting taxi afterward is a bit hard.",,,
,,What a view,5,,Not being a person who does heights well I struggled a wee bit with this. i did however overcome this and enjoyed the amazing views on offer. You do feel very safe in the huge pods.,,,
,,An amazing experience,5,,Loved everything about this. The staff were extremely friendly and we chose a time that wasn't very busy. The views were amazing and we will remember this day forever. Do not leave Singapore without going on this attraction.,,,
,,Fly over Singapore,5,,"The Singapore Flyer gives you a chance to overview Singapore for a reasonable prize. The staff there are very helpful and friendly. After your ride small restaurants at the ground floor invite you for a meal.

The Singapore Flyer gives you a chance to overlook Singapore as well, if the weather is clear, having a look to Malaysia.The staff there are very helpful and friendly. Small restaurants invite you for a meal for reasonable prizes.",,,
,,fantastic views,5,,"I went a 7pm on a Friday evening and the Flyer was fairly empty so I had just 5 other people in my spacious capsule. The full revolution feels a lot slower than the London Eye and lasts a full 30 minute. I cannot remember what the Eye was. The views of the Garden by the Bay are spectacular as are the night time views of the business district skyline and the bay with the Merlion from afar. Go at twilight so you can experience both daylight views and get to the top of the ride and come down as night is falling and the city lights up. Time it so that you get in the cab 5-10 minutes before the published sunset. Not always easy to do but I was able to do it because it was not crowded at all that evening. At about $30 (US), i thought it was reasonably priced.",,,
,,"up, up and away",5,,"see the world from the top of the flyer, we were a little apprehensive to go on the flyer, it is so high, but it moved so very slowly and takes 35 minutes for one revolution we never felt the least scared and loved the experience very much, would repeat it in a heartbeat",,,
,,Average,3,,"It is very expensive as you pay 33 S$ for 20 min, it did not impress me, you can have better view for Singapore them taking the ride",,,
,,Relaxing views,4,,"Cost is worth it as quite a long ride, slow and steady so you get time to take everything in, relaxing soulful and romantic. Awesome views. Air conditioned huge cabin. Highly recommend.",,,
,,Fab View,4,,"Went during the week so no queues.
Catch the MRT to Promenade station, follow the signs to Exit A. Walk outside around the block for about 5 minutes. You can see the Wheel in front of you. Take a bottle of water to drink.

There are numerous cafes and bars around the outside. Souvenir and photo shop.

There is an interactive area from the entrance leading towards the viewing pods, this probably keeps you occupied if there are large queues.

We walked straight onto a viewing pod with about 8 other people. There are seats in the middle of the pod and then large viewing windows for great photo opportunities.

The Flyer is accessible for Wheelchair users

A complete journey takes 30 minutes, its very slow so you don't know you are moving. Amazing Views over the city and beyond.

I recommend you look on www.groupon.sg for special offers",,,
,,"Overrated: good view, but not a good value",3,,"Sure, the view is nice from 165 meters above the city, but before you shell out the exorbitant admission, ask yourself: would you rather pay that fee for a 15 minute view of the city (it is indeed only the 15 minutes of the 30 minute ride you actually get a decent view), and from behind a window, stuck in a capsule, or would you rather go up much higher, stay as long as you want, get a better overall view, and actually pay about half the price? I say, skip the Singapore flyer and walk 10 minutes to go to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. You go up the 56th floor observatory, have a large open space - that includes shops and restaurant, where you can stay as long as you want and have much better, uninterrupted views. Also, if you are visiting at night, then you will not be able to get good pictures from the Singapore Flyer, because the capsule is moving and your pictures will come out blurry (unless you have a really good camera with a fast lens). On top of the Marina Bay Skypark, however, you can just put the camera on a tripod or the flat edge, and take beautiful night shots of the city and the Gardens by the Bay.",,,
,,Something different,4,,"If you have some spare time while visiting Singapore this is a very good way to see the entire country and spend a good hour altogether. Its very relaxing, clean, and of course very beautiful in terms of sight. It is a bit pricy but it is one of those things you do once.",,,
,,Overrated,2,,"For significantly less price, go to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark instead. You can stay as long as you want (rather than just a 30 minute ride), you can enjoy a drink, sit around, view the city both day and night. Far better value.",,,
,,Views are great,4,,"Spacious cabin, comfortable seats, and the view is great if the weather and air is clear. Was a nice relaxing ride.",,,
,,Top of Singapore,4,,Clearly one of the better rides. It is an engineering marvel and travels at a rate to give you plenty of time to see the surrounding area. Clearly a must do thing if you are in Singapore.,,,
,,Worth doing and great views,4,,The Singapore Flyer is well worth doing. Great views and is just above the F1 track. It is a good pace which allows you to see everything without going too fast and seeming like a theme park ride. Only negative is that it's a little expensive for what it is but it's still worth doing.,,,
,,Dinner on the flyer!!!!!,4,,OK.... Food was average... VERY average... But the experience was amazing... Drinks at the lounge then an hour drinking and eating as you you saw the beautiful lights of Singapore... Would recommend it!!!!,,,
,,It鈥檚 a great experience!,5,,"This is a must do if you like watching aerial city views. We visited around the F1 time and could see the track. We got a separate booth for the entire family. It was great up there and Singapore looks beautiful at night, plus you can see Malaysia and Indonesia as well. The entire rotation takes about half an hour. This is the tallest ferris wheel in the world, so it鈥檚 funny seeing people crib about this on tripadvisor and saying London eye is better.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,"What an amazing way to see a large aerial view of Singapore.

Very safe and clean with fast efficient staff assisting in getting on and off. One ride lasts 1/2 hour.

Be sure to carry your Singapore airlines boarding pass for discount.

A must do in Singapore.",,,
,,Top view from the top!,4,,"We visited Singapore flyer in June 2012. We had 5 minutes queue before 'the flight'. The ride was so smooth and slow. Might be a little bit boring for some people. It took about 45-50 minutes of each flight. I think it was best to ride it around 6.30-7 pm as the sun starts to set. You can see the Singapore river glowing in the afternoon and enjoy the astonishing view as the city lights start to glow at night.

I think seeing a city from a top is always breath taking, but Singapore itself is a great city. It is great to see it from above.",,,
,,Big cabin cars with great views,4,,"Go on a nice clear day and you can almost see all the cool sights of Singapore. We got a discounted coupon from our hotel package which made it worthwhile, or else it is a bit pricey. No lines for the ride around 11am during the weekday.

We were hoping for a private car for our family group but the workers pushed us in with another couple even though there were nobody behind us waiting (annoying). Other than that it was a fine experience.

The car is huge with windows all around, and benches in the middle for seating. There are also map pamphlets which tells you what sights you're looking at which was useful. It would be neat to see the night view with the lights but we were not going to pay again to return.",,,
,,Worth doing,4,,"We went up on clear day and had some great views across Singapore. The staff are friendly and efficient and the pods are clean. This is a great 1/2 day activity - by the time you have visited the Journey of Dreams (included in the price) and wandered through the shops and gardens. It is suitable for all ages, so just go along and enjoy the views....",,,
,,Safe & nice view,5,,"At first we are a bit afraid, thought it's like ferris wheel, but this one is high tech & 100% safe. Highly recommended",,,
,,wonderful view,5,,"We chose the time of sunset so that we can see the city in day light, see the sun set and night lights. It goes very slowly for 40 to 45 mints and we enjoyed the singapore view and took lot of vedios and photos.",,,
,,Nice views,3,,I did expect more though. The views are nice but not breathtaking and even though London Eye is 5 meters shorter the views there are spectacular no matter where you look. The Flyer is a nice experience but I guess it's better for older people. It goes too slow and it got boring at some point.,,,
,,OK but not exciting,3,,"Seeing a city from a height isn't new - most cities have a tall building you can climb and view the vista. This is a slightly different way to do that (and not cheap). We did the ordinary trip with no frills. Seeing any city laid out before you is usually an amazing sight, and Singapore is no different. The Flyer gives a good view over the amazing harbour activity.

Be warned, if there is any potential of lightning, the Flyer is shut down.",,,
,,Room with a view!,4,,"The flyer was great. To see so far and so much of the city, the bay and the architectural feats a must see and experience you don't even feel your moving!",,,
,,What a view,5,,"We absolutely enjoyed our time on the Singapore Flyer, we went during the day, have read many reviews how good it is at night too. Loved looking over Singapore and get such a fantastic view of everything. I am scared of heights - was quite apprehensive and didn't go right up to the edge but sitting down I could still get a great look at the views - you won't regret it if you do it. Not cheap but still worth it.",,,
,,Must visit place...,4,,"This is the first tourist attraction in our trip... You'll get to see the Singapore city view, Marina Bay Sand, etc. Good cabin space. Nice spot for photographers. It is not crowded and took around 30 - 40 mins. Must visit place in Singapore. Only downside is entrance fee is bit expensive.",,,
,,Rainy day,3,,"Well on the day i went to the Singapore Flyer, it was raining heavily :( I went with my family, so we waited for the rain to get smaller before going up for the ride.

We still could see out of the capsule on the way up but our pictures were not very nice as the raindrops were in the way of the nice view. It was an okay ride and i did like being high up in the air so i guess i did enjoy myself a little. i did take a picture on the way down though.

Its not a really exciting ride but I guess it should not be exciting right?",,,
,,Wow!,4,,"I am totally afraid of heights, but this was amazing! Could see so much of Singapore and look across to Marina Bay Sands. Glad the cabins had bench to sit on when I got scared!",,,
,,"It鈥檚 ok, but don鈥檛 waste your money on the 鈥渃ocktail flight鈥?,3.0,,We weren鈥檛 sure about going on the Singapore Flyer", as we鈥檙e not a fan of typical tourist activities, but decided to go along as we had some friends who had pre-booked tickets.,,,,
,,,,,,,,
I think the flyer is overpriced at $33, but the $69 price for the cocktail flight is an insult. For the extra money you get a single Singapore sling type cocktail (served in a champagne glass) or a glass of champagne, the privilege of sitting in a 鈥淰IP area鈥? which is simply a room with a TV and a water cooler, before getting on the wheel and a souvenir champagne glass.,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
We were lucky, as we were the only people in the themed capsule during our ride, although that鈥檚 not guaranteed. The capsule is decorated like a trendy champagne bar, with dance music playing and a bottle of champagne in a cabinet.,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
I didn鈥檛 think much of the flyer ride itself. Yes, it鈥檚 bigger than London (which is the flyer鈥檚 main claim to fame), but when on one side you鈥檙e seeing the same city skyline you see from just about every vantage point in Singapore, and the ocean on the other, it鈥檚 a bit of waste.,,,,
,,,,,,,,
If you really do want a cocktail flight, at the time we visited there was a special offer where for $79 ($10 more than the ticket alone) you get a bus and boat tour of the city, as well as free entrance to an aquarium on Sentosa Island.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
It would have been nice if the staff mentioned this to us when we were buying the ticket," as we only discovered this the next day after spotting the ad on a tourist map.""",,,,,,,
,,"Fabulous view, nicely managed",5,,"Cabins are big enough to accommodate 10-15 people easily. Though in general there are lesser occupants than this. The views are simply amazing, and I doubt if any thing else can give you such a panoramic view, you can see the merlion (zoom your camera), garden by the bay, marina bay, duck tour boats the skyline, and what not.

So if you doing a tour for view of these area, skip that and take the flyer. Nothing comes closer to the unobstructed view it provides.

About cost, we took the family value pack for 62.40 (2+1). and I think it was for sure worth the money we spend. If that is not an option than also, there are numerous offer going on in the city for flyer(all of them cheaper than the retail cost). So just explore a bit and you will get good rates for this attraction. Search the local deals site as well.

At last 1/2 hour worth spent.",,,
,,Singapore from atop 165 m,4,,"Singapore flyer is a very nice place to go and have look around Singapore, Singapore Bay, and Sea. Its very relaxing to sit down and see the beauty of a modern planned city. If you wish, you can go for lunch of tea on special payment. Very safe and it offers brilliant views",,,
,,Great View,5,,What an amazing view. If you are travelling to Singapore you have to visit the flyer!! It has one of the best views in Singapore. It takes about 45 mins to go around. Loved the commentary. Worth the trip and the wait,,,
,,A Must See In Singapore,5,,The view from the Flyer was absolutely amazing. It was one of the first things we visited and enabled us to get an idea of what we wanted to see and do on our short stay. The flyer was spotless and moved very slowly so we never felt the effects of being sky high.,,,
,,well worth it,4,,great view from the flyer of the city. would highly recommend it. I dont believe that you can see the entire island from it as they claim but the view is just fantastic,,,
,,Great views,4,,"Ok, it goes very slow, it is not super exciting and it is quite expensive, but it is worth while to do it at least once, to go around in the Flyer. The views are superb and it is relaxing.",,,
,,Singapore's Eye,3,,"The Singapore Flyer is supposedly the world鈥檚 highest. It can鈥檛 be missed as you enter the city from the airport. I resisted for some months before taking it. I wanted to wait until it rotated clockwise, as opposed to its original anti clockwise mode. Apparently, according to the metallic speaker guide in the capsule, the Feng Shue Advisors told them to change the way it turned.
Each capsule is large. You could fit almost 30 people in one. I was a little amused at the routine you go through once you buy your ticket, but given the price of the tickets (an exorbitant $33), when they give you a boarding pass and announce the departure of your flight, you might as well be boarding Scoot or Tiger: except, that real budget airlines are cheaper.
Is the view worth the half hour trip? I really can鈥檛 decide. Given that you can see most of the same from the top of several tall Singapore buildings for free, probably not. Given that it is an experience for tourists with more money than sense, OK.
And then if you have not been caught on the way in, on the way out you can run the gauntlet of restaurants and eateries and ice cream shops and fast food places and food courts and souvenir shops and gift shops鈥?shall I continue?",,,
,,Soar high above the city on The Singapore Flyer,5,,"This is a great thing to do when you first arrive in Singapore to give you a comprehensive overview of this rapidly growing city. The wheel which is actually the largest giant observatory wheel in the world and a staggering 42 storeys high is located at The Marina Promenade, a fifteen minute walk from Boat and Clarke Quay. You can buy the tickets online in advance, the cost is $33.00 a reasonable price for such an amazing view. If you have bought your tickets in advance then go straight to the second level, allow 30 minutes before your designated flight time, to give yourself time to pass through The History of the Singapore Flyer and the security checks. This also gives you time to pick up something to eat or drink as there are plenty of places here.

The visit on the wheel is open from 8.30am-10.30pm, it is great both day and night although totally different experiences. During the day you will see the city and iconic landmarks such as the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Raffles, The Merlion, Gardens by The Bay and The F1 track. By night you will see this stunning city illuminated by thousands of lights. There are many different packages you can take on the wheel from the basic flight, to high tea, dinner and cocktails. The flight takes about 30 minutes and vistas different on every side.

As an amateur photographer, I would suggest you go up first thing in the morning when the lightning is perfect and illuminates the city skyline beautifully. The weather in Singapore often builds up during the day too, so early trips are usually clearer. I went up at 9.00am and had the whole capsule to myself and didn't have to wait in a single queue.

I would suggest after an early morning trip on The Singapore Flyer, head across the double helix bridge and spend the rest of the day visiting the beautiful Gardens by The Bay. A perfect way to experience the city from and aerial view and then complement that with feet firmly on the ground in the relaxing and exotic gardens which seem miles away from any city at all.",,,
,,Great views,5,,London Eye could learn a thing or two. Didn't realise you were queing as walked through interactive room. Great fun even for us oldies!,,,
,,High Flyer dinner,3,,"Beautiful view at night. We had dinner there for the experience. Aperitifs and appetizers were loaded when we went in and served as soon as we took off. At the next round (30mn later), dishes were off loaded and main course loaded. Thirty minutes later, it was over and we had dessert/coffee in the lounge below. Needless to say, the food was not fantastic but ambiance was romantic.",,,
,,Great Singapore Flyer,5,,Great views from the Singapore Flyer and there is more to see now than when it first opened in 2008.,,,
,,Worth the cost!,5,,"We were in Singapore for 1.5 days at the beginning and 1 day at the end of a cruise. Both full days it rained quite a bit (not unusual) but on our 0.5 it was a glorious sunny day and we hit the flyer. Our family consists of teens and young children (ages 8,10,14 and 15).

The flyer was amazing! The trip takes 30minutes. You really don't feel like you are moving unless you look inwards to the centre post.

The view is fabulous and it was fun to play find the landmark with the (not to scale) map they give you.

It was easy to get to using the SMRT and the staff were helpful. Apparently this is not an attraction for locals and we just walked on, no lineups.

The pods are air-conditioned as well.",,,
,,"Its ok, but....",3,,"The best time to go I suggest is at sunset, so you can see the sunsetting and the lights coming on. The view is ok, but I think the MBS sky deck offers a better view of the city.
Takes about 30 mins to do one circuit.
You can book and have a meal while taking in the view, and this I believe allows 2 circuits to be completed.
Its a pleasant ride in the evening, but I think is really a novelty ride. The changing colours of the flyer is one nice feature, its like a 30 min light show.",,,
,,Great views,4,,Worth a trip for the panoramic views of Singapore. The trip takes around 30 minutes and provides a good view of the city of Singapore,,,
,,Must do!,5,,"I am afraid of heights, so with that said, I knew I still wanted to get on the flyer. I am so happy I did! It is a great way to see the whole city and enjoy the view. The flyer is very steady and you would never know you were moving. It only takes 30 minutes.....and it sure is worth getting on.",,,
,,A must visit for all visitors to Singapore.,5,,"It offers amazing views of the city and surrounding areas. Great experience, considering both my wife and I are not too keen on heights, it was fantastic, couldn't tell that we were moving as it is moving very slowly, the whole cycle takes approximately 30 minutes to complete.",,,
,,"Ok, could be better",3,,"We had dinner on the Flyer. The experience was good, service good. The food was a bit of a let down and could be improved upon. Overall, nice to do for a special occassion.",,,
,,a must see,5,,"Do not miss this if you are in Singapore. I did it twice in one day - once during sunset and once at night. As a photography buff, I was looking forward to the city and sea views the Flyer would afford me - and I was not disappointed.",,,
,,City View,5,,The Singapore Flyer does not only provide an excellent view of the city but also offers a dinner experience. The slow movement of the wheel makes it ideal to see the whole city. It is a must-try for those with the fear of heights because it may help to overcome it.,,,
,,Cool ride,5,,"The ride itself takes 30 minutes. It never stops but you board and debark as it slowing revolves. Each car is the size of a small city bus but my wife and I had one to ourselves. We had expected long lines for tickets and boarding but there were no lines at all. We even were given the senior fares although the ticket booth sign said that they were only for Singapore residents. We both really marveled at the number of ships coming and going from the harbor. There is a good exhibit showing how the flyer was built and other engineering aspects of it that is worth some time also. Best way to get there is via the MRT to the Promenade station. Look at the area map before you exit the station it's about a five minute walk if you get it right, a lot longer if you don't.",,,
,,A nice ride.,4,,Just wanted to see how the night view of Singapore compared with Hong Kong. Not a cheap ride but it offers you a half hour or so to view the good view of Marina Bay. It should be interesting if you have a few friends together and join those special flights that with Singapore Sling or Moet & Chardon.,,,
,,Some view,5,,"The only thing I didn't like was the ""dream"" experience they put you through on the way to the actual flyer. It really doesn't mean anything. However, the actual thing is incredible and better, I hate to admit, than the London Eye. Amazing !!!!!!",,,
,,Awesome,4,,Yes there is only one way to see Singapore - walking amongst the residents. But boy if you want an added boost to what the City really looks like take a trip on the flyer. I visited in September just before the Grand Prix and had a fabulous view if the track and the pit lane. Definitely good value too!,,,
,,Fly Away Safely,5,,What a fabulous experience!!! The sights are amazing!!! Fly way to a wonderful experience..Quiet and divine sights of Singapore,,,
,,360 Degree Views from Top,4,,"Flyer by the night was a wonderful experience! The panoramic view of the well-lit buildings and important landmarks of Singapore was truly breathtaking.

The most interesting part was the hallway to the entrance. You are treated to a series of fascinating images, facts and information. This is quite unique to the Singapore Flyer that sets it apart from the London Eye.

The Singapore Flyer is a 30 minute flight and that's quite enough to get your snaps and views on all sides.

There are many dining options at the Flyer premises, apart from their in-flight dining option which is expensive. Singapore Food Trail, a hawker center styled food court is worth a try. I think this is one of the best places in Singapore to try the famous Hainanese Chicken Rice.",,,
,,Not really worth a visit,3,,"If you must go then do it in the evening when the city lights provide quite a sight. In the daytime there really is not much to see. The view from the top of Marina Bay Sands is better. Generally, Singapore does not provide much of a view.",,,
,,Good fun even though cloudy day,4,,"Even though the weather was very grey and overcast we still had an amazing view from the pod. It's higher than the London eye with great views of the Marina and the city. Book online for a discount, but well worth the money.",,,
,,Great View,4,,"My family and I were there at night. It was a nice view of Singapore, comfortable environment with chilled air con. Should be one of the MUST attractions in Singapore.",,,
,,Nice view from Above,4,,"Do it at night. You can see all the lights from Singapore's most attractive tourist attractions. Lights from the Garden of the Bays, seeing the welcoming hands from the top (ArtScience Museum) and Complicated, DNA like lights from Helix Bridge.

It is a 30 minutes ride and the capsule is comfortable and spacious. Although I think the price is a bit pricey, admission fee is SGD 30 (read: expensive).",,,
,,The Most amazing Views,5,,"We were very lucky with this attraction.. we arrived just as it opened on a Sunday morning in March and had a cabin for just the 4 of us.. this is the best way to see the complete spectacular phenomenon of the Marina Bay development.. the Sands Hotel design with the sort of floating arch set adrift in the sky is spectacular. Some of the best views in all of Singapore.. great for visitors of all ages.. so much going on in this area of town.. Museum of Art and Science, the Gardens by the Bay and the entire Sand Shopping centre.. just to see this amazing architecture such a treat....",,,
,,Great views at twilight,5,,"Bought tickets from hotel, walked up straight on, no Disneyland style queues. Big pod, clear windows, Air conditioned (nearly everything is in Singapore except the streets). Pick the right day and time and its spectacular. We went at twilight which we've been recommended to do on other big wheels.. We were not disappointed.",,,
,,Beautiful Views & Engineering Marvel,5,,We had heard that the best time to ride the flier was at night in order to view the lights of the city. Upon boarding the flier we marveled at the engineering feat & the sheer scale of the wheel. The flier was futuristic & very clean with small groups assigned to each capsule allowing for viewing comfort. The night views were fantastic from the Marina Bay Gardens to the massive city sky scrapers.,,,
,,Great View of Marina area,5,,"Great views, a must do in Singapore. Very relaxing, gives you plenty of time to agree where at the marina you want to go to next. Of course it is not far to Raffles Hotel for the afternoon.",,,
,,Superb Flyer!,5,,"Riding Singapore Flyer will take your breath away particularly at night where city lights are so stunning! It's a unique way to watch the whole stretch of mainstream Singapore!

The Flyer has a capacity of more than 12 persons and can accommodate two or more small groups. You can stand and roam around the capsule to catch the best spots and it will always be when you are on pinnacle almost same level with the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which happens to be adjacently located.

The rotation is so slow you won't feel moving until you'll realized you're on top and going up. It only takes 30 minutes and you'll feel disappointed because you haven't enough of the great views. Pricey but worth the experience!",,,
,,"You gotta do it once in your life, but then ....",4,,"Short wait, smooth ride, great view of the downtown area, harbor and Barrage, but not well-accompanied by explanation of what we see. Happy that I went once, not likely to repeat the experience.",,,
,,Fantastic views!,5,,"While 'rides' like this is not usually on our itineraries, we made an exception after deciding that the Marina Bay Sands Skypark seemed a bit overpriced given that we would be restricted to the one end of it. On the Flyer, we ended up in our own 'capsule.' It was fun to see the unfolding skyline as we rose up one side. Great view of the harbor.
Might be fun to do the dinner ride the next time.
(And although the 'senior' pricing was supposed to be for Singaporeans only, the ticket seller was more than happy to give us the discount. Don't be shy to ask for it.)",,,
,,A must for all Singapore visitors,5,,"The views from the Flyer are breath-taking. My only negative is that the Marina Bay Sands Skypark is higher, so if you go up to the Kurr De Ta cocktail lounge you will get the same view for the price of an expensive drink.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,Gives you a great view of the city. We went on it during the night which was lovely to see the city light up,,,
,,Exciting before boarding but boring later,3,,"We were so excited to go for this. It was fantastic to be there near the flyer, we took many pictures with flyer in the backdrop. Very nice entry for the flyer. Once you are in the flyer after 10 mins it was all same. 30 mins to pass is boring. Of course Singapore looks beautiful with all important buildings seen from there. But I thought same can be seen from any other tall building. So I would say if you have lots of time you can see this attraction for sure. But if you are in Singapore for short time , I recommend to see other things first and then come here if time permits.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,We went to this place to see and try this famous flyer :)..Entrance fee or the ticket during our visit was SGD 29.. Before riding the singapore flyer we first pass their gallery this includes the history of the Singapore Flyer.,,,
,,Night flyer,5,,"This is something that should be done at night to Get the full effect.
Really beautiful way to see singapore at night with all its lights and glamour.
It is a lot less crowed at night and we had six ppl in our capsule which doesn't feel crowed at all.
Full 360 turn takes abt 30 mins to complete. Best to take the ride on its own without the food and drinks option as its a lot cheaper. Plus there are hundreds of options for food and drinks near by.
A great way to see singapore.",,,
,,Sights,5,,"The whole area is very beautiful and the organisation is brilliant very efficient, once on the flyer on a clear day its possible to see other islands as well as the whole city the capsules are quite large and plenty of time to take photos.",,,
,,Great,5,,Really good to see the sights via the flyer. It is fairly slow which you would expect however it was superb for taking photos. Very reasonably priced and easy to get to. Well worth doing.,,,
,,Nice to try but expensive.,3,,"I have taken the ride with my wife and two child. It cost me 75 SIN $ for about 30 min, it was nice to see Singapore at night with the lights and and all but it is an expensive ride. warning if they took ur picture don't go and buy it, it is better to take ur camera with u.",,,
,,Must do,5,,"Finished off an exhausting but brilliant day in Singapore by having a ride on the Singapore Flyer. Arrived there by MRT got off at the Promenade Station about 5-10 minutes walk away. Cost S$33 which using a currency converter today is approx. 拢17.64 so not cheap. We have been on the London eye and its the same, about a 30 minutes smooth ride with fantastic views of Singapore. They took a picture of you before you board but ours looked awful and we did not buy (we had been out for about 10 hours and looked sweaty and tired). If you are in Singapore its a must do, we are glad we did it and would recommend.",,,
,,Sensational views,5,,"Time your visit for dusk and see the city in a new light. The capsules are spacious with large windows to take photos. Easy to get to by bus, taxi or hop on hop off buses. Discounts for seniors. There is a dining capsule if you want to stay up longer.",,,
,,Great way to see city!,4,,"this is a great way to see the city at night, help orientate yourself, good on first day. if you travel in Singapore Air, you get a discount. good activity on the first day when all jet lagged and tired.

Be prepared to queue, but it moves pretty quickly.",,,
,,Highly overrated,2,,"We went around 7:30pm to get the night view when buildings around Marina Bay are lit up. We opted for the package without the food/drinks (which doubles the price). Between the entrance turnstile where tickets are collected and stepping into the capsule, there are some interactive displays along the walkway. There is also a cheesy baggage scanner which I assume mimics the experience of taking a real airplane flight, hence the name ""Singapore Flyer"" and not ""Giant Ferris Wheel"". The structure rotates continuously and very, very slowly so there is no problem stepping into and out of the capsule. Once inside, you do not feel any motion. Each capsule accommodates >30 so don't expect much privacy. Once at the rotation peak you get nice views of surrounding hotels, performing arts venues, etc. The main problem is that you can get much better views elsewhere for far lower price-- the adult ticket fare is more than $30 Singapore, whereas you can go to cafes/ bars on the high levels of hotels in Marina Bay, buy a drink for much less and get panaromic views at higher altitudes. The ride lasts only 30 minutes as opposed to hanging out in the cafe to your heart's desire.",,,
,,It is what it is.... a big round about,3,,"You get on, you go round, you get off. Sadly this is the attraction having said this good views but over priced and slightly disappointing.",,,
,,High Flyer,4,,"Not too expensive. There is a bit of pre-amble as you make your way through to the Flyer, but all you want is to get on board and see Singapore from above. The views are worth it. Great view of Marina Bay and downtown Singapore.",,,
,,great view,4,,We went late at night. It was a sight to behold. Would recommend going this time as we got the pod to ourselves. And the night skyline was beautiful. Definitely recommend this,,,
,,Beautiful!,5,,its totally a must visit place! I totally loved it! its a little expensie(33$/person) but totally worth going!,,,
,,Good views from up high,4,,"This huge wheel is a great way to see the city from up above. Be careful not to be crammed in as they will try to fit 20+ people in a carriage is they are busy. We were lucky having a large group behind us so there were only 8 of us in our carriage which allowed everyone to move around easy to take in all the sights. At S$33 or S$74 for a family which seems to be a standard sightseeing charge in Singapore, I recommend you go at twilight so you have the advantage of seeing singapore by day and by night.",,,
,,Nothing special,3,,"1. You will experience the flyer in a cabin with almost 20 person capacity!, the cabin is closed and there is not any open window to enjoy
2. For 33 S$ i don't think it really worth it. There is nothing special about it. You will have better experience of seeing singapore from above if you go up the skypark tower!",,,
,,Same as London Eye,4,,Highly recommended place for everyone visiting Singapore. Gives you a bird-eye view of the city and the kids are going to love this place. The flight is about 45mins but gives you a awesome 360 degree experience of the entire Singpapore,,,
,,A big wheel,5,,"Yes bigger than the London Eye and cheaper,great organised operation something that London should do.Great views over the harbour and the gardens well worth the time,35 minutes of a/c bliss.",,,
,,exilirating!,5,,being on top and seeing the whole of singapore and mostly being inside one of the tubes with bunch of happy goodfy friends and family! just sad its only less than an hour. the cost is ok considering its an attraction!,,,
,,A place where you can get a perfect view of Singapore and neighboring Johor Malaysia,5,,"As one of Singapore's newest attraction, this place is considered to be a tourist exchange point for visitors in Singapore undergoing City tour, Sentosa Tour, Night Safari Tour, Science Centre tours and many others. One good thing about our 1st day here is that our first two tour guides were very much friendly and they gave concrete information about Singapore and some of the attractions around. What ruined my experience here was that before our Sentosa Tour, one of the tour guides left us there and we informed him that we arrived earlier than expected because we were fetched 30 minutes early and according to our itinerary, the pick up time from the hotel to the Singapore Flyer is 8:30 AM. But all in all, this Singapore experience was a great one.",,,
,,Great views from the top!,4,,"Visited the flyer mid-morning, hadn't booked in advance but there wasn't a big queue - in fact we shared a pod with one other family.

A clear day in singapore afforded us lovely views of the Supertrees, MBS and more.

A fun half hour - or longer if you take your time at the start through the information bit.

(The photographs they take are a bit daft and you are superimposed against fake backgrounds - better taking your own camera and taking pics yourself).",,,
,,Great way to see the city,4,,"No wait to get on. Had only 4 other people in the capsule, so plenty of room to move around. Definitely recommend.",,,
,,A Good Arial View of the Singapore City Centre,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is located at the Marina Promenade and is within walking distance from the Garden by the Bay. Me and my wife decided to check out the world鈥檚 largest Giant Observation Wheel on 29 March 2013 after our morning walk at the Garden.

At the Singapore Flyer鈥檚 main Terminal Building, there is a three-storey podium with shops, bars, restaurants, fast food joints and local eateries for the convenience of the visitors. There is also a Tourist & Transit Hub located at the ground floor of the Podium which co-ordinates local tours and transfers to the various Singapore Attraction Places.

This Attraction Place is rather small in scale but the Singapore Flyer provides a good Arial View of the Singapore City Centre and it is worth a visit by all visitors.",,,
,,Incredible view,4,,"This is a must if you are visiting Singapore. A great view of the Harbour, F1-track and city. Only thing is that they could have cleaned the windows a little better.",,,
,,Worth the time,4,,"Great views and a good way to get your bearings. Good look at both sides of waterfront and casino. Formula one track, housing, dragon boats, golf course and parklands can all be seen",,,
,,Good view of the Bay,4,,"We had great time taking pic of the view of sin from the flyer.
its approx 30 min ride and short walk (15-20 min) to marina
If you have SQ boarding pass, make sure to carry 1 with you as u will get 20% discount on the flyer entrance which is good enough for 4 pax.",,,
,,Panoramic view of Singapore,5,,"We had a high tea flight in a private capsule with a butler for our group. It was a little too expensive. We were supposed to get on the capsule at 3.30 pm but somehow it was delayed until 5.30 pm which turned out perfect as we also enjoyed watching the sun was about to set. However, once the capsule started to take off, all conversations stopped and everyone just looked out for the great panoramic view of Singapore. Great fun.",,,
,,Place you can see how is Singapore!,4,,"Unlucky, when I ride on the flyer, it was raining :(

But view still nice :) I still can see many places...
I think if I go there in the evening, may be more beautiful :D I will try again next time!

Beside that, have the garden and a china area for food :) food is good, staffs are friendly, but have to wait over 7 mins",,,
,,A nice ride on the flyer,3,,"It was touted as one of the must-see attractions but we weren't all that impressed. It is basically a 30-45 minute ride in one of the enclosures on the big wheel that rotates probably all through the day. The view is of course, very good - makes for a few good photos but the novelty fizzles out pretty quickly. I'd suggest giving it a miss if pressed for time during your visit to Singapore.",,,
,,Very slow and real smooth,4,,"Reached the flyer after a walk from the Gardens by the Bay. The flyer was an amazing sight as it slowly rotated. Not jerky and the movement was hardly noticed. lovely views all around of the bay and CBD. We could see the Formula one track beside from the top. It would have been good if there was some sort of commentary, indicating the interesting aspects once we reach the top. The map that we had was more like a cartoon and not like a real thing",,,
,,Great ride to end the night,4,,"After a tiring walk, this place is the last visit of the day.

We got tickets from a Singapore Group Deals, since the ticket is a regular ticket that can be used before 6pm, we upgraded the tickets ($5 each) so we can board the flyer after 6pm to see the city lights

There are restaurants at the ground floor, such as fast food, seafood restaurants and a Yaa Kun Kaya toast stall, there is also a hawker style food court at the corner

We enter the gate and walk through a dark tunnel, its the Journey of Dreams, a multimedia presentations about Singapore and the Singapore Flyer
Then we get a photo taken by the staffs (which we have the option to print the photos at the exit after riding the flyer, at the souvenir shop)

For those who bring baby strollers will have to leave it, a friendly staff will hand over a ticket so you can collect the stroller again later

A security check is needed to check your hand-carry bags

A single capsule can be boarded around 10-15 people, the wheel is still moving as you board the capsule. then off we go.. we have around 30 minutes, and around 10 minutes at the top position to take pictures.

It was a pleasant flight, our son loved it

ah yes, I forgot, about the photo taken by the staff before... when we walk in the souvenir shop and look at the result.. there are few options of photos, edited with the flyer background.. for S$20 ?? hmmm.. no thanks...",,,
,,Fantastic views from Singapore Flyer,4,,Thought I was scared of heights but the amazing views from the Singapore Flyer were worth the ride. Whole rotation takes 30 mins so you feel you are hardly moving,,,
,,Must-go place,5,,"A very great location to see the whole Singapore! It would be good experience if there are more incentives/ privileges for travel group, such as promotion for certain time.",,,
,,Not 'just another' Ferris Wheel,5,,"Some queuing for the wheel but it was orderly and we kept moving. The views over the Harbour, CBD, Grand Prix Circuit, and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel were stunning. Good value for money.",,,
,,Great views of the city,5,,A lovely addition to your stay. I would recommend going up at dusk to get the best mix of the last of daylight and the amazing lights of the city.,,,
,,Well worth a visit.,5,,"We visited the flyer on a Sunday morning. I imagine it can be quite busy at peak times. S$33 for adult, the ride lasts 30 mins, with some long distance views.",,,
,,Lots of great food!,4,,"Even if you don't intend to ride the Singapore Flyer, please visit this place for the choices of great food here! The one that we dined in is a Chinese seafood restaurant, can't remember the name but you wont miss it. EXCELLENT! Highly recommended!",,,
,,Nice view from tallest wheel in the world,4,,One among must visit Singapore attractions. Great view of Singapore city and coast line as well. Flyer moves very slowly and you don't even notice it is moving. The ride takes about 30 minutes and will keep you busy exploring Singapore. Kids will enjoy ride the most. Recommended to find a promotion package rather than purchasing this ride alone. Promotions available all year along and are easy to find.,,,
,,Don't be scared of heights!,5,,The Singapore Flyer is located on the waterside a shortish taxi ride out of the city. The whole experience is very slick. The gondola's are very large and can hold around 24 people (I think) The views across the city are amazing. It felt very safe even at the top! No sway at all. I recommend it even if your terrified of heights.,,,
,,A must do!,5,,If your in Singapore and get chance definitely take a trip on the flyer it is so worth it! The views are amazing up here. It takes about 30 mins to go round but you dont even feel like you are moving. Capsules are a good size so everyone gets to see and bring your Camera as you ll definitely want to take some snaps!,,,
,,Best Singapore scenery,4,,the best way of to see Singapore scene. you can see Marina Bay Sand Hotel across and the botanic gardens and the port of Singapore.,,,
,,Excellent ride,4,,"For this price, the half hour ride was a fair deal. You can take a look at every side of the city from the top, and especially overlooking Marina Bay's new developments. Very worthwhile!",,,
,,Flight Simulator.,5,,I had been to the flight simulator at Singapore flyer. It was an awesome experience it was a first hand experience of flying an aircraft. The pilot was an amazing person he was very patient and caring towards my son who took the flying experience with him. It is a must do and experience.,,,
,,Magnificent Views of Singapore,5,,"This tourist wheel attraction is magnificent , about 20 stories high and you have 360 degree views of the city. We were onl able to do this ride during the day. At first we were disappointed but in actual fact it was better as we could view all of the surrounding city sights. It would be magnificent at night so if the opportunity exists do both day and night. It is not expensive and only takes about 30 minutes or so. A must do for any age. Even though you are so high there is absolutely no need to fear and the ride is ever so smooth. AAAA+++++",,,
,,Dont miss this when you are in Singapore,5,,"This would be one of the most amazing part of your stay in Singapore. The best time to go for this would be the evening twilight time, this would provide you the opportunity to see the Singapore Sky Line in both day light and the illuminated sky scrappers in the night.",,,
,,Fantastic with a baby,5,,We didn't think we were going to do this but it was included with a package we bought and went. We really enjoyed it and the view was amazing. I highly recommend this especially if you have kids. Make sure you buy with a package cause if you buy it there it's $33 for adult.,,,
,,"A little bit scary, but fascinating",4,,"This was our second ride, last one a few years ago. It is the best thing to do, to see what has changed in Singapore..and change it has. You can see all the new developments. Best time is at sunset, so you can see changing lights. Buy your tickets before you go, to avoid queues. We bought in conjunction with the Aquaduck, and found these 2 combined is a great fun way to see around and get your bearings. If you don't like. Ferris wheels, you will hate this!! But be patient and persist as it is beautiful. There are plenty of cabs when you get off, if you need transfer back to hotel, or anywhere. Cans are so cheap, don't hesitate to use them. Drivers are all very courteous and speak English well. They will help in any way they can. Lots to do, and lots to enjoy, so take the time and do it!!!!",,,
,,Worth the visit,5,,The view from the Singapore Flyer is simply breathtaking. It is impressive to see how the city is growing at the expense of the sea. 10 years ago there was an open sea where Sands hotel & casino is located these days.,,,
,,Must do.,5,,"This is a must do in Singapore. Even for those who suffer from a fear of height and motion. The flyer you can hardly feel it move it is so smooth. In your air conditioned gondola you can have a great view of the marina and new botanical garden site.
We travelled by taxi to the area and had breakfast and a coffee at the entrance. There is no way you can add calories with the cheese and kaya toasted sandwich. One puff of wind and its gone.
Singapore in my opinion is now over sterile and certainly must rate as one of the more expensive places on earth.
Go on to do he new botanical garden and flower gardens a great experience and truly magnificent layout and conception. Easy no rush and surprisingly cool.",,,
,,If you don't do this you are dumb!!!,5,,"But really, who would not want to do a 45 minute ferris wheel ride that gives you a better view that the Marina Sands. Hands down worth the 33 Singapore Dollars to do it. It is right next to the F1 Paddock and that stays the same all year round so you can check out the entrance and exit to the pits. Nice!!

Make sure your camera is fully charged as you will take a bunch if pics! Awesome views.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer - Giant Ferris Wheel,5,,"The Giant wheel gives a great view of Singapore city, ticket cost is 33 Sing Dollars. Full view of Marina Bay area.",,,
,,Get high if you are a kid,3,,Nothing spectacular especially if you've been to Marina Bay Sands top lounge. But good for kids I think. They all must experience something like it.,,,
,,Fantastic View,5,,"When you are riding on it you will feel that the time pass very fast. From Singapore Flyer view, you can enjoy the top view of Singapore there. The night view of Singapore is very charming and attractive. Really recommend this ride. The best one!!",,,
,,Singapore Sling flight,4,,"We booked the flight before we left England via the web and chose the Singapore Sling Flight. We arrived at the Flyer and was taken to a lounge to await our pod. We were then taken through an area of neon lighting to our pod and was presented with our Singapore Slings. We had the champagne pod all to ourselves. It was an afternoon flight and to be honest there is not many land marks to spot. A good view of Marina Bay Sands and the pits for the Grand Prix. It was relaxing, but I think I would do it again at night time. Definitely well treated and we had souvenier glasses to keep.",,,
,,Not a must do attraction,3,,"It's not a bad experience to be in a capsule on a giant wheel, which gives you good views of the city. Adds a different perspective to Singapore. We visited at day time on a clear morning and had good views of this dynamic and growing city.
But, if you ask me personally, i think the bay sands viewing deck offers better views, so this could be a 50-50 on your trip.",,,
,,up up and away,5,,"Good value for money,cheaper than the London Eye and its 5metres taller and the views are better.We travel on this every time we go through Singapore and there is always something new to see",,,
,,awesome view of singapore,4,,this is a smart way to see singapore from top the view is more nice in the evening it is view plus excited ride of half hour it is similar to londen eye if you are going with kids & seniors then buy package tickets at their when i visited their was a package on second floor restaurant for $36 flyer ticket with indian buffet dinner please check it before buy it is better to see singapore from the top than skypark because you are moving in a smart capsule.,,,
,,Awesome and great views,5,,"It may be a bit boring at first with the ultra-slow-crawling spin, but you realise that the money is not to waste. The cabin is spacious and lounging around is top on the list. From the top, if the weather is clear, the whole of Singapore can be seen. If it is nighttime, the stuff is breathtaking. This may be a spoiler but I definitely recommend and the tallest Ferris wheel of the world is truly grand.",,,
,,Good views,4,,Thoroughly enjoyable trip on the Flyer. Fantastic views out to sea but a little hazy. Enjoyed seeing the Marina Bay Sands up close and where the Grand Prix stands are. If we'd been in Singapore longer then we would have gone up again at night. Worth a visit.,,,
,,on top of world,5,,Its a must go place .Its newly installed and worth to visit. the view is breathtaking and you can admire the beauty of singapore .its good to see the concept that you have to limb in and out on the moving capsule.the attendents are good in handling the jumps.the capsule can take 20-25 people at atime.you can shoot amazing phots if you have a high zooming camera.dont miss the thrill................,,,
,,Wonderful view of Singapore,4,,the flyer probably gives the best possible view of Singapore and you should go there in the late evening to see Singapore night skyline at its glory.....the view towrads the promenade and the financial district is awesome.,,,
,,Nice views,4,,"We've had seen the same In London Eye. However, the capsule in Singapore for not more than 10 people and we were nine, so we enjoyed the views much more than we had in London Eye.
There is an introduction and simple map inside the capsule for the whole surronded area with its attractions. It was the first night for us in Singapore so we've learnt alot about the main attraction from this flyer.
Good start to know most the attractions of Singapore.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Nice ride, Great view to see the city by night. Lines were not long either. Has done flyer twice but like the night view better.",,,
,,Just do it!,4,,"We started our trip to Singapore with a ride on the Flyer. One of my daughters is afraid of heights, but this proved to be no problem as the Flyer moves very slowly and you don't really notice you are moving. There were no crowds the day we went so it was easy to move around the cab and check out the views from every angle. It really gave us a good overview of downtown Singapore. We definitely felt it was worth the price. We did get a discount as we got our tickets as part of the Hop on Hop off Bus.",,,
,,Lovely view of Singapore,4,,It was an nice experince in singapore flyer.Amazing view of Singapore from top of the flyer.There were nice sitting arrangements in the glass capsule.Lovely garden around with attractive frontage.Another attractive thing was that Red Farrarie which was on display on the front.Overall an great experience,,,
,,Make sure it's a clear day,4,,"Excellent with good views towards the Singapore sky line and out to sea, seeing hundreds of ships. Whilst 5 meters higher than the London Eye, views not as good.",,,
,,Choose your day,4,,"We chose to visit the Flyer on the first day of our stay in Singapore as we were using the hop-on, hop-off bus service and this was one of the stops - so we thought 'Why not?' Later, during our stay in the city we found that rain and cloud moved in during the afternoon and visibility from the Flyer would be minimal - so choose your day and be prepared to be spontaneous.

Shortly before midday there was no queue for tickets or to board our 'pod', which we shared with two other couples - so there was plenty of space to move around or sit down as we wished.

The views across the city, harbour and out to sea were great and certainly helped with our orientation and planning for the remainder of our stay. The ride takes just a little over thirty minutes but there is little sensation of movement and is certainly not something to be afraid of. I imagine that entering or leaving the capsule could be a little challenging for those who are infirm on their feet, but there are always two assistants to help each individual make that step should they need help. If you are able to cope with stepping onto and off an escalator then you will find entering or leaving the capsule just as straightforward.

I read a review which suggested the Flyer is boring and wondered whether the reviewer simply had not understood what the Flyer is about. It is not a Ferris Wheel in the sense that you have the physical thrill of an ascent and descent with the sudden adrenaline rush as you go over the top. This is not a ride for thrill seekers. Instead this is an opportunity for calm observation - an opportunity to observe the city from above and to see how the whole fits together.

This attraction is recommended - but not for thrill seekers who would find their expectations better met on a fairground ride.",,,
,,Singapore Sling Flight,5,,The views of Singapore from the Flyer were amazing and the 30 minute ride was made all the more enjoyable with a Singapore Sling to drink. Instead of sharing a cabin with 10+ people my husband and I shared a Moet and Chandon cabin with just one other couple. We had seperate areas to sit so it was like they weren't even there. Fantastic!,,,
,,Such great views,5,,"A great experience, you get to see so much. Great to do if you are able to have a guide with you explaining all that you are viewing. I'd recommend it if you are only in the city for a day to give you a good overall view of the city.",,,
,,Touristy spot with nice local food,4,,"The view and the experience is a wanted, no doubt. But it is still a touristy spot and you hardly find many locals unless on Christmas or the Chinese New Year. The 30min ride is an experience of a life time and something that Singaporeans should experience at least once, just to see how much Singapore's skyscape has changed. Oh and after the ride (come in the evening, the sunset view is fantastic) grab some affordable local food at the food trail eatery (food court style) at level one. The Oyster omelette and chicken rice are to die for!",,,
,,Nice sceneries,5,,"Amazing views on top of the Singapore flyer, a truly once in a lifetime experience. Really enjoyed myself. Got this package from dealssg.com.. It comes together with the Gardens by the Bay entrance..

Both my young cousins were really overjoyed.. Can't recommend it enough..

Overall, great experience.. Will definitely go again if theres more deals and promotions!!!",,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,"A must see in Singapore. Try and pick a clear day to go. Great views of the city and surrounds. I am afraid of heights and was initially reluctant to attend, but the cars move slowly and it is not scary at all. Go early before the crowds as the line up can be long. Food court downstairs on the road side of the attraction has cheap local food which is tasty.",,,
,,Great views!,5,,"We enjoyed our night-time trip - it wasn't too busy so we could walk around the cab and see all the sights - Singapore looks lovely when lit up at night.
At $33 SD we thought it worth the money - The London Eye is more expensive!",,,
,,Afraid of heights - but great views,4,,"As the title suggests - I'm not a fan of heights. However, the views more than compensated for the butterflies in my tummy from being SO high up. Getting to the Flyer was very easy as we made use of the hop-on hop-off bus service from 'DUCK & HIPPO' - which stopped right outside the Flyer. There are some interesting interactive exhibits before you board the Flyer which are pretty cool for kids and adults alike. Once onboard, the views are amazing from start to finish. You get to see some breath-taking views of the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the ArtScience Museum as well as the Central Business District. I would definitely recommend this as you get to see amazing views in an airconditioned capsule - so vitally important in SIngapore's constant humid climate.",,,
,,Must try at singapore,4,,"I tried Sing Flyers after 5th visit because i feel something uncomplete if didnt try flyers. The location is easy to reach, the facility is complete, bcoz its not only the flyer, so much attractions there like 6D, and pilot and also the food court is great. I scared to high, and doubt at first, but when finally i was in the capsule, i feel so secure, because u wont feel the rotation at all, its all very smooth. It took 35 minutes for the rotation and it s a great experience to me, but maybe the ticket little expensive.",,,
,,A good helicopter view,4,,"Enjoy the ride as you get in to the flyer and it takes you up slowly on a 30 min round to get a 360 view of Singapore and its beauty.
I had made the visit in the a'noon and so it was good to see the vessels stretched out in the ocean and all the other tall buildings including the Marina bay sands, Raffles Place, Merlion Park, Espalande, F1 circuit etc..
Its also said to have a good view in the night with all the city lights coming up.",,,
,,nice for whole family enjoyment,4,,"i was doubtful that wheather my wife will enjoy singapore flyer as she does not enjoy rides , but it is not a ride it is very much enjoyable for every age group me my wife 10 yrs old son and 3 yrs old daughter all enjoyed it very much it gives very nice view of singapore and nearby beautiful buildings . even if you fear rides you will enjoy this one !!!!!!",,,
,,Spectacular - A technical Masterpiece,5,,"We visited the attraction at 9PM on a Wednesday, basically empty, we were a total of
6 people in the ""gondola"", ride takes about 35-40 minutes, on a clear night qou benefit from
spectacular city view and a great view of the ""Surfboard"" (Marina Sands) next door.",,,
,,flyer,5,,"singapore flyer has more advanced attractions like 6DXD.it was amazing,i never had a such excellent and thrilling experience had before.must enjoy!!",,,
,,The view is amazing; especially in the night,5,,"The tallest ferris wheel (at the time of this review) provides some mesmerizing view from the top, especially during the night. The ride was for under 40 mins. The adult fare was 33 SGD, but showing a singapore airlines boarding pass helped reduce it to 26.40 SGD. The residents at Singapore still consider this expensive, but visitors should not heed to this and head for the view. As we'll be touring so high, nothing is close enough to give us a sense of fear of height, so I doubt if anyone feel any vertigo, if that is a concern.

The way to the cabin has so many informative stuff, so make sure you are not in a hurry. The last ride entry is at 10.15pm. They also provide dinner and high tea inside the cabin at a premium fee paid in advance.",,,
,,An hour long waste of your life,2,,"Well, this is how it was described to me by locals. I chose to go anyway. My mistake. Nothing terrible, just... boring. There are better views of the city available from hotels and this ride seems interminable. I cannot recommend you spend your time here. Go to the (free) Gardens By The Bay a short walk away.",,,
,,Worth the price,4,,The views are fantastic. The stepping on and off may be a bit daunting for some. The wheel turns very slowly but it was a challenge for one elderly gent. It is flow enough to indulge in mass photography. The views are incredible on a clear day.,,,
,,Worth the ride for the views!,4,,"I had looked up on this long before we had booked our holiday to Singapore, & I was definitely going to be going on it. I wasn鈥檛 a disappointment. Stunning views from up top, looking over the Marina Bay& Gardens by the Bay. We went on board the Flyer, pretty much as the last paying guests of the day, so it was pretty late at night, but we had the cabin all to ourselves, it was magical. It moves really slowly, not stopping to let you on or off, but taking photos is easy because it鈥檚 so slow. You feel like your getting your moneys worth since your on for a bit of time, think was bout 35min for full rotation, & there is plenty of room inside the cabins. Like I said, the views at night are stunning so I would recommend going at night, you can also see the road track where the Formula 1 circuit is, which I never noticed at ground level. It was $33, bit steep yes, but you can鈥檛 come to Singapore without going for a spin. It is the world鈥檚 largest observation wheel after all.",,,
,,Worth paying for the views,4,,"Fortunately for those over 60 the price drops from SGD33 (US$27) per person to SGD24 (US$20) per person; still fairly expensive for anyone on a budget in a city that has a high standard of living.

It's best to try to go during the week when there will be less people; conversely sometimes you'll have to wait for others to join you in the relatively large cabins; we were lucky to travel on our own.

It moves so slowly, not even stopping to let you get on or off, that taking photos is very easy. Try not to pick a day when it is overcast or rain is forecast, like it was on our visit, when a thunderstorm broke out, the ride was stopped temporarily, then completely for about an hour just after we got off. Photos will also be much better on a clearer day.

We didn't get a chance to travel at night but imagine the views would be excellent.",,,
,,Great Views,4,,I am not terribly good with heights - but I am so glad I took a breath and took a ride. Firstly you dont feel as if you are moving at all - no rocking of the pods. The views are amazing and as it goes around so slowly you have plenty of time to capture great photos. The day we went was very clear and we had no-one else with us in the pod.,,,
,,Great Ride,4,,Most enjoyed the scenes from and view...something not to be missed when you are in Singapore. Great place to walk around and do sight seeing.,,,
,,Nice ....,4,,"For those who have not been in a flyer before. In Singapore, there is so much to do and if you have already tried the flyer somewhere else, this is not a wow!",,,
,,Worth doing,5,,We took some great advice and went on just before dusk. To watch the sun setting and the city light up was truly spectacular.,,,
,,Good view of Singapore,4,,"Enjoyed the Singapore flyer, journey is around 30 mins. We had about 10 other people in our carriage, so a very noisy, would have loved to have gone on our own and savored the experience,",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Probably a must if you are in Singapore. Wonderful views, very cleverly designed observation capsules to give excellent vision. No sensation of moving (it's slow!) but if your scared of heights there's still a central refuge in each capsule that tends to make it easier than staring out over the abyss. Incidentally, and excellent and varied food hall underneath it!",,,
,,What a view,5,,The trip on the wheel took about 40 minutes and provided teh most wonderful views of central Singapore and the surrounding waterways,,,
,,Expensive but interesting,3,,"The Singapore Flyer ""experience"" was worth the effort but the price is a bit steep for what you get. If you've been on the London Eye, the Flyer will seem a bit ""ordinaire"". You get a good view of the Singapore Marina area and parts of the city, but better views can be had from some of the rooftop restaurants and high rise buildings that are open to the public.
The Singapore 'hawker-style' food court near the Flyer is a good option for a quick snack 鈥?good value, great food.",,,
,,"Expensive, but wonderful",4,,"Wonderful views and a perspective of the whole city. Relaxing Price high, little senior discount Definitely recommend despite the price. Gift shop has a good selection and OK prices",,,
,,"You get some nice views, but is it worth it??",3,,"This thing isn't cheap. It goes around slowly ONCE. Each pod needs to be loaded. It does give you time to take pics as its not fast moving as people go in and out you have time for photos.
By the time you get back to where you started, it's over. For those loaded with cash go for it!
If your on a budget, not sure its worth what you pay.",,,
,,Great Additional to Singapore Tourism,5,,"A perfect ride and we were able to see so clearly the City of Singapore,but there's no proper restaurant around, just a number of fast food chains",,,
,,Great Experience.,5,,"Bigger than the London Eye with spectacular views over Singapore.Well organised entry and exit,timed our visit for when the sun was setting so had day and night views.Amazing !!!!!",,,
,,Breathtaking views,4,,"Loved coming here, was a nice place, amazing views of Singapore and well worth the price paid... It does go slow round so a better chance of seeing more sights Would definitely recommend and would go again if going to Singapore",,,
,,Brilliant trip,5,,"The setting was good, walk area underneath 'flyer' with plants, water, fish etc. Excellent views over Singpore. So many other things to do there you could actually spend half day there if you had time - we didn't - just did the 'flyer' but so glad we did.",,,
,,Relax! Enjoy SIngapore!,4,,"Early one morning my husband surprised me with a ride on the Singapore Flyer. At opening in the morning and mid-week is great because there are very few people, no crowds. The line moved very quickly so the allusion of crowds should not stop you. Helpful staff fantastic view of this great city! I will go again and strongly recommend it for all age groups. There was a wheelchair visitor that also enjoyed the ride.",,,
,,Good to see where you are,4,,"Ticket office were very helpful and offered pensioner tickets rather than the BoardingPass discount from Singapore Air. Kind of them as we weren't really eligible, old enough, but from the wrong country!!
As a mid week trip, it didn't take long to get into one of the capsules.
'Flight' was long enough at a bout 30 minutes, but could have done with some sort of commentary or even a map showing the main points of Singapore.",,,
,,I'm on top of the World at the Singapore Flyer,5,,"I'm afraid of heights but this experience in the Flyer changed all that... a Must Try experience in Singapore... The whole experience runs for 30 minutes to see the entire city... We paid SGD$33 per person at the entrance when we tried it on March 2, 2013. Kids 11 years old and below have a lower rate... There are several shops and restaurants in the area.... Due to a hectic trip schedule, we didn't bother to ask how to get there by bus or train so we took a cab from our hotel in Orchard Road to the Flyer... It was a quick ride... Getting a cab from the Flyer back to Orchard wasn't difficult as there was a taxi lane. Over all experience: EXCELLENT!",,,
,,"good view, but expensive",3,,"if you plan to hit Marina bay sands skypark, then may be better skip this Singapore flyer. because you will get the same view over the city. besides, u have to pay 33 SGD to get on it.",,,
,,GREAT VIEWS - EVEN WHEN IT'S CLOUDY!!,5,,"It was late afternoon and rather overcast when I arrived. It wasn't very busy at all and once I got through all the information points, it wasn't long before I stepped into one of the capsules with two other people. It was rather overcast and by the time I was half way round, huge dark clouds came scudding across the sky, but the view was still amazing!!
I had planned to walk to Gardens By The Bay afterwards to see the Supertrees all lit up, but as I got off of the Flyer, it started to rain and within 5 minutes, it was absolutely chucking it down, so I wandered around and looked at some of the displays as well as the shops. I was particularly inrigued by ""Kenko Reflexology & Fish Spa"", where you can dangle your tired feet in a tank and a group of fishes will come and nibble away, leaving you with lovely soft skin!! Wasn't barve enough to give that one a go, though.",,,
,,Tallest in the world,5,,Great view and sight u get from this flyer which goes at a snails pace. The whole round takes 30 minutes. U can get great pictures here also the city looks wow from up here. The day view is better for pictures. Truly worth it.,,,
,,Good views acroos the city and harbour,4,,Well worth the half hour as you rise above the city and get a great perspective of all around and out into the shipping lanes.,,,
,,Excellent Veiws,4,,"This ride gives you a spectacular view of the city, it is better at night as the skyline is full of lights and you can see as far as Malaysia",,,
,,London Eye of Asia,4,,"Singapore is a compact city but has lots of attractions to see.
The Singapore Flyer is one attraction and one experience
that is a MUST.

I've been to the London Eye but Sinapore Flyer claims to be
bigger and taller. The experience was worth it - I would say.

This was part of the group tour we opted that day.
I like the restaurants and little shops on the way
to the Flyer. The souvenir shoops are amazing.

I believe it is best to try the Singapor Flyer
when Singapore lights up.",,,
,,A great view of the city and relaxing,5,,On a Yjursday afternoon we were lucky enough to have a cabin to ourselves. So like the London eye but instead of looking at the old you are looking at the new. Great views to be had of Marina Bay and the Gardens by the bay. A great way to get a perspective of Singapore. Dinner for 2 is an option and could be very romantic.,,,
,,Well worth doing,4,,"We visited the Flyer in February 2013 having already booked it from the UK - this was somewhat cheaper than paying on the day. We had been to Singapore before so wanted to look at the sights from ""on high"". It was a bit difficult to get to the Flyer on foot as at the time of our visit there was an awful lot of building work going on in the area which meant that you could not just walk straight to the Flyer but had to make a number of diversions. The nearest MRT station is Promenade. It would seem that they are going to make another station to connect with the new cruise terminal but even this would not be next to the Flyer. It is about a 5 minute walk from Promenade to the Flyer. There is plenty of room in the capsules and the views are good if you choose the right weather!! We were lucky and went in the morning when it was sunny. All in all, it is worth doing this attraction. Aside from the actual ride, there is an awful lot to do in the Flyer building and lots of restaurants so you could easily spend a whole day there.",,,
,,An interesting experience- but you have to pay round-trip,4,,"If you enjoy cable-car rides, you'll probably enjoy this one. One major drawback is you must pay for a roundtrip ticket even if you want to go one way",,,
,,Fun ride!,4,,"Singapore Flyer is a nice way to see the city. Must go on a day when it is not raining or you cannot see anything. I went on a Wednesday afternoon and it was not crowded at all. Also did the flight simulator - expensive, but very cool if you are into that kind of thing!",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,I liked the views and the way that it was slow so u could take pictures. I also liked you could sit down and it is family friendly,,,
,,Do it !!,5,,Float above Marina Bay and see all of Singapore. Yes it is a tourist place but Do it. Have a champagne in a gondola for 30 minutes and enjoy the lights and secenery of Singapore.,,,
,,Relaxing way to view singapore,4,,"Great views, nice way to relax while still sightseeing. Capsules were clean & air conditioned. Takes 30 minutes to do one loop, no toilets on board.",,,
,,Great view,5,,Great view of the night lights of Singapore. We were hoping to see a bit of the Marina Bay Sands laser light show. Unfortunately you don't see much. This was our second night visit. We will go back again for a day time view,,,
,,Flying High,5,,The Flyer is in a great location being adjacent to the Marina Bay Sands and offers great views of Singapore.,,,
,,Height & Sight,4,,"We went to visit this on our first morning in Singapore. The lonely planet had outlined which MRT and bus to catch; however the bus never arrived, so we flagged it and went elsewhere. We later found a pamphlet; which identified the MRT and bus to catch - which got us there and the views were amazing. It helped us orientate to this diverse city.",,,
,,Great views,4,,You get some great views that you would'nt get from anywhere else. Plently of space and no waiting straight on and only a short distance from a very good hawker centre. Worth a trip.,,,
,,Stunning day and night,4,,"This ride is quiet expensive, with no deal for a day and night ticket but worth the trip. Id go at night if you had to chose one as the city lights are stunning.",,,
,,Dizzy,4,,If you like heights do it and if you don't then skip it. Awesome view from the top but it's a long wait in the line to get on it.,,,
,,"Great View, well worth the cost",5,,"This was a great late afternoon early evening experience. We rarely buy the photos that are taken at such sites but these were spectacular,we bought the lot. The view over Singapore, Sentosa and surrounds is fabulous. We met some other travellors in our car and immediatley struck up conversations on the views and shared cameras to get it all in...the only negative... we walked from Raffles Hotel thinking it was only a few hundred meters down the road. We could see it from there and we made that estimate based on how big we thought it was... mistake.. it is huge.",,,
,,Take it or leave it,2,,"Ok enjoyed the experience but was just an average "" must do experience"" similar to The London eye only its 30 metres higher,which only means everywhere looks smaller because of the height. If you have somewhere better to go then i'd recommend you do that instead.",,,
,,Good for once,4,,"Good price, good weather, there was no queque when we visited around 11am on Monday. Staff was friendly. You can basically see everything up high and very spacious.",,,
,,could have been better for that price !,3,,"A so-so attraction, hyped a lot i'd say. the least they could do is to have some sort of commentary played so visitors know what they are looking at! I heard some commentary only when our capsule was at the very top. I never got to identify the spot where they say we can see Malaysia. In any case, a family that was there in our capsule was too loud chatting, so even a commentary would not have served its purpose.
All said, no denying the fact that the Flyer is an engineering marvel",,,
,,Good way to view the city,4,,"We did the Singapore Sling Flyer experience. You can book a set time so no waiting in queues and you get escorted to the capsule by a staff member. We only had one other couple in our capsule so it was nice and private. The views are just stunning and it goes for about 30 mins. Great way to see the city.
Please note that there are cheaper options available if you do a tour package with the hop on, hop off bus and river cruise.",,,
,,Great experience,5,,I really enjoyed the whole ride. Slow and plenty of time to look around and spot the landmarks in Singapore. I will definitely do this again in a couple of years. I will admit I did feel quite nervous at one stage with so much glass and we were so high up so I gripped on tight to one of the poles. Ps the claw marks on the pole were not mine!,,,
,,A sky high view,4,,"A clear day in the middle of the week and what happens? No one is about and we get a pod all to ourselves. 30 metres taller than the London Eye so you get great views across the city and the bay. I can imagine if you go at a busy time it could be worth the extra cost to do a package - with priority boarding and fewer people per pod. However, if you pick your times that wont be necessary...",,,
,,A must for visitors to Singapore,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is reasonably priced and enables you to get a very smooth ride with extensive views of Singapore. It offers a dinning option in the evening, but patrons must book a day or two in advance. Plenty of scope to take some great photos for all those budding photographers.",,,
,,"Nice view of the city, but not a must-do",3,,"If you've run out of things to do, the Singapore Flyer can be fun, but in my opinion it's an average-level activity that is overpriced. However, it's difficult to get a helicopter-height view of Singapore without paying at least $25, so if you're into heights in very safe, enclosed spaces, and love looking at cities from up high, this might be for you.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,Try this if you not done before.you can view the city from top 360 degree. Enjoy the 30 mins period and you will feel steady to stand inside the cabin.,,,
,,A must do.,5,,Flyer was an experience i wouldn't miss. We went just as it was getting dark and the city was lighting up. We timed our ride to see the Super tree light display but were disappointed as it was too far away to get the full effect. Super tree lights are better viewed from ground level.,,,
,,On a clear day you can see forever...,4,,Well worth the price of admission. Lucky me I had a cabin all to myself so I got to see everything with an unobstructed view. The ride is leisurely and the views are fantastic. A whole different way to see the beautiful city of Singapore.,,,
,,Do Not Hesitate,5,,"Do not hesitate, unless you have a fear of heights. Quick process, did not have to wait in line very long. Even though there was a line up they didn't overcrowd the cars. Enough space for everyone to walk around and get a good view. We timed it to the sunset. By the time we made the full round, we were able to see and capture some great shots in partial daylight and night.",,,
,,good and new experience,4,,Very nice and new experience. From singapore flyer a good view of full singapore city. The ride is of appro. 45 mins When the flyer reach at the top the most memorable experience.,,,
,,Cool skyline view,4,,"Really efficient staff, ride went really fast, good view of the city, good have done with an audio on what buildings were where etc !",,,
,,Great Views,5,,Look! I will give you the tip to visiting this attraction. Be waiting when it opens in the morning and you will get great photos of the Marina area with out having to line up and wait in line.,,,
,,Great views from the top,4,,Just like the London Eye. Nice views. Were told that you could see Indonesia and Malaysia from the top and so you could but still not sure which one was which :( Kenko fish spa is in the same complex.,,,
,,Do it for the first time..,5,,"Appreciating the beauty of a place--not to mention the whole SG, plus a part of Malaysia and Indonesia--should try to ride The Singapore Flyer. Getting to see all those attractions at once is not just only worth the dollars but as to amaze on the breathtaking views, which reminds me of a friend telling me about how SG WAS and hey, this IS how it goes. I'm just proud of the people who develop, maintain and putting everything to progress even more.

We visited in the morning (around 0940 AM) which is very convenient for us since there's no queue yet and we had our time to enjoy and explore the museum before the actual ride. We were only 8 in the capsule so we were not as crowded as expected.

They said it is also good to try this in the evening (almost 8 PM onwards) when the city lights are on. :)",,,
,,Pretty good,4,,the waiting time was very pathetic but the wait was worth it! one can go really high and catch a glimpse of the entire city at a go and also the neighboring country Indonesia. Nice concept!,,,
,,For once....,4,,Overall experience was special...specially taking out my wife on a date in the wheel and having a whole private cabin...its special!! worth the money spent....,,,
,,Wow!,5,,"Higher than the London Eye - well a bit! Formidable views over the island and beyond. I was especially interested in the shipping lying out in the Straits and awaiting a berth at the docks - there were hundreds of them from all around the world, reminding one that Singapore is where East/West and West/East shipping passes each other through the Straits.: I ruminated, briefly, on the where abouts of all those thirsty sailors with money in their pockets but prudence reasserted itself and I left them to their well earned leisure.",,,
,,Too expensive too ride,3,,"As with everything in Singapore its $$$, We went to the flyer on the possiblity to take a ride, but upon finding out the it was to cost aprox $30.00 per person, and at that stage had already spent over $120.00 per person on other activities we opted out",,,
,,A must see if you're in Singapore!,4,,"This ferris wheel is taller than The Eye located in London, England. It has amazing views. Hopefully you will be lucky like we were and get a room that only has a few other people in it. You should go twice, once in the day, and once at night. It is very worth it!",,,
,,Choose good weather,3,,"This attraction is ok, but to worth the high dollars for me. The view was nice enough. Make sure the weather is decent, so you can make the most of the view. I liked the goldfish in the ponds.",,,
,,One time experience!,4,,"As most of the people think it's not a ride. It's rather a slowly moving wheel where you can see the city in 360 degrees. It was a one time experience. The night time view of the city, Marina Bay, the river and the Gardens by the Bay was amazing. Best time to visit is after 7 when all the lights on.",,,
,,good on a clear day,5,,"really good views , choose a clear day , and if like me you are over 65 you get senior rate admission",,,
,,Nice experience,4,,"It appears that it could offer more but it was not as great an experience as we thought. SGD33 per person was a little too pricey. In addition, we found out many alternative city views for free e.g lounge bar at One Fullerton. First 10 minutes was exciting and thrilling but the next 15 minutes became a drag. Overall I think that you should go for it at least once in a lifetime.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"It is a slow moving wheel , from where you can see the entire Singapore city. You can have food inside it.The evening view is amazing. nice and pleasant experience.",,,
,,Nice view from Top,4,,Great view of singapore from flyer. Its really beautiful. Also able to catch glimpse of indonesian islands. I went there twice once in the afternoon and again in the evening. Both the time the experience was totally different. Must try attraction in singapore.,,,
,,Good,4,,The flyer is beautiful and nice relaxing thing to do. But skypark much better view. If your going for view then It depends on the experience you are looking for flyer is alot more relaxing - skypark is 3/4 times higher.,,,
,,Worth a visit for the views across the city and Sentosa,4,,"TIP!! If you are there during the formula 1, particularly the practice days, the entrance to the flyer is close to the ""Paddock Club"" where drivers will enter the race circuit. If you wait around for a few hours you are likely to see some familiar faces. We were very lucky bumping into Schumacher, Vettel, Coulthard, Rosberg, Barrichelo, Senna, Petrov etc....I guess they stay in hotels near by

You can get a pass to the flyer along with the bus tour ticket...definitely worth doing

Also, make use of the tourist information centre on Orchid road, the staff there are extremely helpful",,,
,,Larger than the London Eye,4,,"The Singapore Flyer - 5 metres higher than the London Eye a great sight - great views of the surrounding area. Another great sight in Singapore was the ""Ship Hotel"". We could not believe our eyes - a complete ship on top of a hotel - you were allowed to go to the top to see great views over the Bay and of course the Singapore Flyer A very diverse and vibrant city. Very friendly helpful people.",,,
,,You can see for miles!!,4,,"A great way to get a birds-eye view of the lovely city/state of Singapore. Not inexpensive, but fairly priced for the experience provided and softened a bit by Senior Discount.",,,
,,great experience for night scenery,5,,"time it to catch the sunset and the night scene, Good place to view the night lights and you can get some good photos because it is very stable. Dont remember how long is the full turn but it ends quite fast because too engrossed with viewing the different areas.",,,
,,great views,4,,"we went up just as it was getting dark so had some fantastic views of all the lights acrross the city. you can dine or have a champagne gondola if you want to splurge. 28 people per gondola so look who you are with before getting on. we had some screaming, jumping, whinging 3 year old whos parents just ignored the little brat. 25minutes later and my experience was ruined. great views though.",,,
,,Good views at night !,4,,"The Singapore flyer is a prominent figure on the coast line of Singapore. The views are wonderful at nights - you get to see the light studded central business district. Of course, you get a very good view of Marina Bay Sands too.
It moves so slow that you would hardly notice the rotation - so there is absolutely no need to worry.
They also have a luxurious suite with a bottle of Champagne - it is expensive though.",,,
,,great view from the top,4,,what a wonderful view from the top...wish we could go a bit more longer...or they would give us two round :),,,
,,Only for first time visitors,3,,"Only if you are a first time visitor, and want to have a look at the Marina Bay skyline view. Personally find it rather slow and boring. There is a nice food hall with local favourites at level one and that kind of excited me more.",,,
,,nice view,3,,"Nice view and clean , Ticket for Singapore flyer is $ 33 / person. Then i like its . everything is ok.",,,
,,nice experience,5,,"The weather was rainy, but the views were still nice. In fact, probably due to the weather, the line was very short. So, we were able to climb aboard quickly. The max capacity is 28 people, but there were only 10 people in our capsule. So, there was more than enough room to walk around and take some amazing photos. One full revolution is about 40 minutes. So, you don't need to stay here all day. Fun for little kids.",,,
,,Best views of Singapore!,5,,"This was truly mesmerising.
My partner & I were in a capsule with 10 more other tourists - and despite this it was spacious and gave us all enough room to walk around to take some photos. The length of time you were in the capsule was appropriate, enough time to really enjoy the sights. It's great for all age groups, and even though I do not have children - I did see that it was something that they would most probably enjoy! Felt completely safe the whole time, and the pricing was reasonable. Would go on this again, but next time I will go at night time!! I love Singapore!",,,
,,Great Experience!,4,,Truly memorable experience with the ride and an overview of the city of Singapore. The portable radio introduction of the various places were good way of information sharing.,,,
,,Great Overview of Singapore,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is currently the largest viewing wheel in the world. The capsules are large enough to hold 25 people but they keep it to 2-6 unless you are in a group which means you can constantly walk around to view from each angle and to get fantastic photos. Some of the capsules also have tables so that you can have afternoon champagne or evening dinner on the wheel, in which case you would make 2 of the 30 minute rotations instead of one. Also, an office for great Singapore tours of every type is located at the foot of the Singapore Flyer. Current cost is 33 Singapore dollars pp.",,,
,,Stunning views,5,,"The flyer goes slowly enough that you have time to look at absolutely everything. Even if you are afraid of being so far off the ground, you will be fine on the flyer because you are totally enclosed and at times you aren't even aware that you are moving.",,,
,,Enjoyable,4,,"Explore Singapore in 30 minutes! This is a short way to enjoy panoramic landscape with S$ 33, if I'm not mistaken. The flyer wheel spins very slow to allow us taking a shot on each of point of interest that the wheel can cover.",,,
,,Expensive and not worth the trouble,2,,After a really long line (called a museaum) you get on this 30 min ride that gets boring after the first 5. The top of Marina Bay Sands is supposed to be a much better view. I recommend the flyer only if you have free tickets and don't have to pay for it.,,,
,,On a clear day.....,3,,"The Singapore Eye is good, but not spectacular. It gives a really good view of the city, Sentosa and the port area as well as view across the water to the hills of Indonesia. It is worth doing however it is really not cheap. Then again the same thing could be said for most things in Singapore.....",,,
,,Singapore's Pride,5,,"Truly the highlight of my Singapore visit. We were fortunate to ride on it just before sunset & the view up there is awesome..The capsule was remarkably stable & we couldn't even feel we were moving at all.There were seats for 28 people but we can still move around to have a better look of the views
of the Singapore skyline, the Marina Bay Sands, & all around. It took an hour to complete the round but it seems I could go on & on...",,,
,,Best to go in late afternoon,4,,"Admission ticket for adults is expensive!! Try to get one of the packages which includes the Flyer. It definitely worth going on at least once. We went in late afternoon so the view was awesome. Got a good view of Gardens by the Bay.

Don't miss out the foodcourt at the bottom of the Flyer!",,,
,,"A ""must visit"" but expensive",5,,"We are told it is the biggest wheel in the world and it is indeed very high. The views over Singapore are magnificent and you can see all city and harbour. You join at high level and is quite a walk so be warned. Take the lift if you have difficulties. The ride is very smooth and takes about 30-40 minutes. The Wheel overlooks the F1 pits and track which adds a little more to the experience. The modules are spacious and for those a little frightened of heights, a place on the central seat should not cause you undue stress. If you are an extreme case, don鈥檛 contemplate it.

It is too expensive in my opinion although I believe they do a cheaper family ticket. There are some snack bars and shops but I am afraid Singapore is not cheap and I found these places a little expensive too for what they were offering.",,,
,,A cool 30 minutes,4,,"We did the champagne ""flight"" at sunset and luckily scored a rain free day with actual views. If you choose the champagne flight there is a big possibility that you will get the capsule to yourself. Its also a bit more classy as you get to go to the lounge before hand for a drink (chargeable) and then you get escorted to your ride and dont have to wait / queue.

Worth doing in my opinion.",,,
,,Part of a great night in Singapore,4,,"We took a ride on the Flyer as part of a tourist tour called A Night Out. The tour included the Flyer, a meal at a nearby restaurant, river boat ride, night market visit, night tour of the downtown area, with plenty of photo opps. Well worth the cost. The Flyer gives a unique perspective of the city, and the 30 mins or so it takes seems like about 10!",,,
,,Awesome experience!!,5,,Had been there by evening and it was a nice experience. Was worth watching the city light up and was raining...enjoyed the complete 40 minutes. This is my first experience in a giant wheel and it was worth every penny..,,,
,,Very nice place,5,,We go at night and can see all the city and our hotel. We had only one couple more in our capsule so was very private for us. Romantic ride. We liked very much.,,,
,,Great views of Singapore,4,,"Great views of Singapore on the world's biggest Ferris Wheel (bigger than London Eye). Ticket prices were a bit expensive, but it is still worth doing.",,,
,,view from the wheel..,4,,"A 35min ride on the flyer,click some nice pics..and some good view from the top.Try to build your own flyer,Something like a module down stairs.",,,
,,Must see,5,,Very good. Must see . Worth for money . The pictures taken at the entrence is expensive. Make sure to take your SLR camera,,,
,,Great views of Singapore,4,,The first time visitor should include this in their itinary. It gives a great view of the city and is a bit of fun.,,,
,,Dance of Lights,5,,"It's an awesome experience on top of it with views of all major tourist attractions with dance of lights. It's picturesque. You could see clearly marina bay, gardens by the bay and very much of the signature buildings. The only cons is, there's a walking distance from the mtr and it's not too convenient during night time.",,,
,,An oldie but a goodie,4,,The Singapore flyer is not as popular now as the Marina Bay Skypark but it is still worth doing. The flyer moves slowly so that you can get a good view of the Singapore Gardens and Marina Bay in the background. The food area is somewhat disappointing as the hub bub is gone due to Marina Bay Skypark. It would probably a good substitute to going to Marina Bay.,,,
,,Overrated and Overpriced,3,,"I was told ahead of time that it wasn't worth the S$45 to go on it, but I couldn't resist. I was afraid I'd miss out on something. I saw views that were great from the rooftop bars, office buildings, etc. Its probably still a cool thing for kids, but I thought it was way to expensive for what I got.",,,
,,you can see batam from here,3,,"a few restaurant in premises including popeye fast food. Near Marina Bay Sand, you can get here free by bus from airport (changi) just ask singapore tourism booth at arrival hall.ticket quite expensive but they have discount for family.from the wheel you can see almost all singapore and part of sumatra island",,,
,,Birds' eye view of the Marina Bay area,5,,We took a package with High tea on the flyer. Generally good food provided though the whole experience felt short. Breathtaking view of the Marina Bay area.,,,
,,Average,3,,"Was putting high hopes on the view that i can see from the top of the singapore flyer, but when i was at the peak, the view were stunning, but marina bay sands hotel, all the 3 blocks were in a row, can really see the beautiful marina bay sands building and take a picture of it.

the time for 1 round was just okay, 30 minutes ++ for 1 round. and pay sgd 32+ for it.

not really reach my expectation, but different people have different views.",,,
,,A must if you visit Singapore,5,,Itsthe largest Ferris wheel I've ever been on.takes about 45 mins to go around.the sights are amazing.a must if you visit Singapore.,,,
,,Best to do at night. Beware when raining,4,,"The cost is a little extra but if you're going to do this I would recommend doing at night instead of during the day. Also, if you plan to take pictures do not take the ride while its raining or has just rained because the windows will be spotted with water.",,,
,,Nice experience,5,,Had been here during the night time and it was a superb view ... the city looks so amazing when lit up and it was worth spending the 30 minutes in this .,,,
,,Good views - but drags a bit - best time is to board 15 mins after dusk,4,,"Personally, I found it a very enjoyable experience.

Getting to the Flyer is easy, it is close to the Promenade metro station, and within 20 min walking distance of Marina Bay Sands' Bayfront metro.

It is a good place to eat with many small cafes and restaurants in the base of the building. Tickets are not timed, but are valid only on the day of issue. After buying the ticket I was told there was a 30 minute wait to get on the flyer and that it is quite hike from ticket office until base of wheel.

Neither were true. There was no waiting and took about 5 minutes to walk to wheel base. There are plenty of queuing pens 谩 la Disney so at peak times I can imagine it can take a very long time to board. I went on week day, at dusk.

To get good lighting for photos, I would suggest boarding about 10-15 mins after dusk. The ""flight"" takes about 30 mins, and the best views are on the 2nd half of the trip, so you get to the top about 30 mins after it starts to dim.

Each capsule takes a max. of 28 people. This would be really cramped. We were 10 people and even then each of us had to take turns taking photos.

Still at 鈧?2 I would do it again.",,,
,,Just Okay.,3,,"Well, for SGD 20+, I can say it's just okay for tourist but let me warn you. There's lots of things to see but not much things to do. I recommend the Singapore Food Trail just below the attraction place and get the ""Kampong"" feel while dining.

The attraction itself? Hmmm. Just okay.",,,
,,Relaxing way to see Singapore,4,,"Worth a visit, especially if you don't have much time as you get to see a great panoramic view of Singapore.",,,
,,Pleasantly Surprised,4,,"I was skeptical鈥?this just seems like such an over-priced tourist trap to me. I live in Singapore, and have been underwhelmed by the reviews from friends and colleagues.

But I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the Flyer鈥?it鈥檚 a wonderful feeling to be soaring over the harbor and city.

Each capsule wasn鈥檛 overcrowded, and the full rotation was a good length鈥?not too fast but not so slow to be boring either. I would highly recommend to locals and tourists alike.

Please note: Prams and strollers are NOT allowed. This was a problem for us鈥?our baby was asleep in his stroller and we were forced to wake him and carry him onto the Flyer pod.",,,
,,Amazing views,5,,I was a bit reluctant to go in this as I am not good with heights but...it was worth every minute. Luckily it was a clear day and not too hot. The views are what you pay for and the cost I felt was reasonable. Singapore is a lovely city and this is a must do if you are there.,,,
,,Cool...,5,,"First I thought I don't want to ride this thing..then my sister told me that I wouldn't even feel that its moving. Well she's right! This thing moves so slow that you wouldn't even notice you're moving. Because of this, it gives you better shots when taking pictures. The views are spectacular!",,,
,,Great views of Singapore.,4,,"Well worth the $33SD trip fee. The views from the "" big wheel"" are awesome. Take the trip late in the afternoon to get the best views of the tall buildings of Singapore. Also likely to be less crowded at this time. Extremely well organised except that the pre- trip displays are too many and rather boring. Afterwards try the Indian restaurant at the complex. Very good value for money and very good food. From the Flyer there are good views of the new Marina Bay Gardens which is a ""must"" if staying in Singapore for a few days.
We took in the Flyer as part of an organised evening trip of some of the major sights in Singapore including Raffles, Clarke Quay, the night laser show, Buggis Street Market etc. excellent value for money trip.",,,
,,Singapore views,5,,What a great attraction to see the whole of Singapore CDB and beyond. Choose a nice day and see for miles. Well worth the ticket price for a family.,,,
,,Great Views,5,,"The Singapore flyer costs S$33 per person for a one hour ride offering spectacular views over Singapore. Lots of photo opportunities, very comfortable - our capsule only had about 10 people in it so we could move around freely looking out in all directions. We had no queues and no problems at all. This attraction is within walking distance of Marina Bay Gardens and Marina Bay - just follow the footpath over the bridge crossing the river. Awesome.",,,
,,Great views of Singapore,5,,Tickets cost about 33 Singapore dollars which is probably similar to London eye and in my opinion are well worth it (its bigger than London eye too). The revolution takes about 30 mins and provides you with the most amazing views of Singapore and beyond. A nice relaxing way to spend half an hour!!,,,
,,Boring!,3,,"Have visited The Flyer twice mostly because I've got overseas friends in Singapore. Unfortunately, the Marina Bay Sands' Skypark and the Supertrees have become very good alternatives to the Flyer. It is boring because it is just one round up and down in 28 minutes. For a great city view at any time you like, I would still prefer to go somewhere else. My choice would be Skypark - or simply go to Kudeta lounge for a drink. Visit Indochine at the Supertree rooftop, it's only $18 or so for a drink and a view. There are many high rise buildings in the city with restaurants and bars. I just don't think it make sense to go round in 28 minutes, pay for it, and got no drink! I suppose it works when you have kids though..",,,
,,Excellent views.,4,,"Worth doing, even if you are petrified of heights like me! We had a fantastic view of the area, and spent a longer time up in the air. At least it felt like that to me!!",,,
,,come by the sunset,4,,"touristic experience - long queues, scholars making photos on their i-phones, souvenir shops... But if you are first day in the Singapore and lucky to finish the queue by the sunset - the views are really impressive an beautiful, the ring itself is highlighted in different colors, the city is calmly coming to the dark with so many lights... I liked it anyway",,,
,,Good views of the city.,3,,"Recommended as an intro to the city on day 1. The views give a sense of perspective to the main part of the city. You can look out to sea, across to the port, pick out the shopping areas and even look down on part of the Grand Prix circuit.
The food court at ground level provides a variety of reasonably priced freshly cooked dishes.",,,
,,Excellents views of Singapore,4,,This tourist attraction is expensive but worth the cash as the views are tremendous. TIP: Try to go just before sunset and enjoy breathtaking scenery.,,,
,,Romantic dining above Singapore!,4,,"Nice dinner aboard the Flyer. Beautiful at night with the city lights. Good service, good food. A bit pricey but once in a lifetime experience.",,,
,,Avoid if you can!!,3,,"It is a giant observational wheel. moves extremely slow and finishes one round in 28 min. too slow and boring. Its good for having a view of singapore and taking some pics but within few minutes, it becomes very boring as it takes so long to finish.

Worse it is 33 S$...

NOT AT ALL WORTH THE MONEY!!",,,
,,Awesome views of the city,4,,"Awesome views of the city once you're high on top of the Flyer. :)
Just as another reviewer stated, this is best viewed during sunset. Last week, we arrived around 7:10pm and there was about a 30 minute or so wait to get on the actual ride. But it was worth it because we were on the ride while the sky was still blue (awesome photos) and not too dark at night. The ride is about 30 minutes long and it moves slow enough that you don't feel nausea.",,,
,,Ok for the SG first timer,3,,"Nothing fancy just looking at the city from the above. Its an ok experience. Actually, Id rather just stay in the marina bay sands and get the same view every time i want鈥?But its something that you have to take at least once",,,
,,Still the World's Biggest Ferris Wheel,5,,"Ns complete without a ride on the Singapore Flyer. Yes, it is located in a somewhat touristy shopping building, and yes, it lets you out conveniently in front of its souvenir shop, but the views from the wheel are pretto visit to Singapore iy spectacular. We went up in the morning on a fairly clear day and had wonderful views of the Singapore Straits, Gardens by the Bay, the Marina Bay Sands and Marina Bay, the Colonial District, the Fullerton Hotel and the Merlion, and the Central business district. The wheel never actually stops and makes a very slow revolution which takes about 20 minutes or so. I thought that was just about the right amount of time. Our compartment was fairly empty so we had plenty of space to walk around and take in all the views. I am told than the evening views from the wheel are more dramatic, but we felt once was enough.",,,
,,Great experience especially the lights at night.,4,,Bit of a queue but well worth it. If you see nothing else in Singapore go here and see one of the cleanest cities around.,,,
,,Has to be in your to do list,5,,"We did the flyer in the morning n still it was a beautiful view. U can see over the F1 grand stand, garden by the bay, the CBD. Of course it would have been more gorgeous to do the same in the evening as the light and the beauty of the lights would have been quiet perfect view.Our toddler was a bit scared at first to see the view but she got comfortable n loved the pod space.",,,
,,Good expirience,4,,"This is big revolving capsule ,good place to see singapore skyline ..excellent views from any angle ..safe not at all frightening .Capsule was stable",,,
,,"awesome time, glad we had a coupon",4,,We were given a coupon for buy one get one tickets so we decided to go. I don't know if we would have gone if we didn't have that coupon but I am really glad we did. The views were amazing and it was just such a cool way to see the city.,,,
,,good place to have a view of Singapore,4,,It's good to take picture from the cabin! The glass is clear enough to not ruin your pics! just don't go at noon! you could be burnt up there!,,,
,,must,5,,it is really beautiful. give a panoramic view of the city. youshould go in the evening as it is even more beautiful with all the lights on. can take a combo with duck tour. kids would love it.,,,
,,Great Views,5,,"I dont like heights but this was very smooth and slow. great photos were taken up in this flyer, plenty of room and a seat if you rather sit",,,
,,Amazing Views,5,,"Amazing views of the entire city, you can see the ports, the F1 tracks, the highrise buildings. We went around 6:30pm, if you plan to take pictures, then I suggest going earlier.",,,
,,ok but other places for view,4,,Enjoyed the experience but the rooftop of marinated bay sands better view. Do one or the other but not both.,,,
,,Great View,4,,A tad bit on the pricey side but I enjoyed it. Lots of opportunities to take photos. The wheel itself moves pretty slowly (maybe about 30 mins).There are different options to choose from and there is a mini tour before you actually get on the wheel. Best viewed at night. There are also a few shops and restaurants to purchase from. They closed pretty early tho as when we got off our ride lots of the shops were already closed.,,,
,,On top of the world,5,,This was good value for money and even though I do not like heights I felt very secure on this ride which lasted approx 30 mins. You could hardly feel the compartment move. It provided an excellent opportunity to get some excellent views of Singapore .,,,
,,Amazing skyline view!,5,,"The Flyer provides a breathtaking view of the Singapore waterfront, downtown skyline, and all points beyond. In my opinion, this is best viewed during sunset/dusk.

Be prepared to stand in line outdoors, which can take 30 minutes or more to board the ride. Once inside the building there are several interesting informative displays and visual attractions.

Once aboard the ""Pod"" the ride takes about 30 minutes. Even fully loaded with passengers, the ride is spacious and provides plenty of room to view the scenery. Air conditioning is delightful and the ride is very smooth. There are no restroom facilities once in the Pod, so take care of those needs before boarding.

Make sure you have fresh batteries in your camera, there are so many things to photograph, you will have a tough time choosing the best shot!!!!! Face it, they will all be the best....

In my opinion, this attraction is a MUST, even for people that have visited Singapore many times before.",,,
,,Was glad I went. A bit disappointed the drinks weren't available,4,,We loved the opportunity to take lots of photos and still enjoy our time on the Singapore Flyer because it was moving quite slowly (takes about 30 mins). One major disappointment was that the drinks flights weren't available when we arrived despite the website saying it's available daily.,,,
,,Excellent,5,,Excellent experience. Gives you birds eye view of Singapore. Though bay area is just average . I was told to look into a particular direction to spot Malaysia. May be I saw it may be I did not !,,,
,,great spot for photos,4,,"If you have some time and money, have dinner there, lots of fun. Food is very good, views are tremendous and the service impeccable.",,,
,,sit back and relax,3,,"After all this time been travelled to sg, finally me and my garlz took the singapore flyer. It was an enjoyable experience. It takes around 45 minutes. I think it will be great if you guys take this experience at night around 7 until 9 instead of in the afternoon.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Not too expensive, this gave excellent views that were not too fast. Boring lead-up to the entry point and not much else to do here but otherwise worthwhile. Walking there is not the easiest as not very close to MRT and roads not pedestrian friendly.",,,
,,Great views,4,,Fantastic opportunity to see and take pictures of the view from all angles. It was raining when we went on it but it didn't spoil it in any way,,,
,,Great views,4,,"Since I suffer from acrophobia, there are lots of things I avoid, but the Singapore Flyer is moving slowly - at least it seems to move slowly - and there is no swinging in the big and spacious ""cars"".
It was really nice, and even though it is relatively expensive I would recommend a trip in it. After all it is the world's highest ferris wheel at 165 meters.",,,
,,Nice for Once,4,,"Few Options including In dinning with a couple! Amazing concept, well maintained, priced up though, makes the Singapore Flyer an enjoyable experience. Do remember to take your cameras with you to capture private moments",,,
,,What a lovely experience,5,,Great views! It moves so slowly..you do not feel the movement at all. Each car holds about 28..but we did not feel crowded in. It is especially beautiful at sunset. One of the must dos when in Singapore. Also very well organized like the rest of the city.,,,
,,Nice Views,5,,"Not too many visitors when we arrived. We did not have to wait for anything. just got the tickets and jumped on board. it takes around half an hour to complete a cycle. it offers beautiful 360 degree views of the marina, ocean and the famous marina bay sands hotel. there is a spa just outside the flyer, and you can experience foot massage by some fish. the street food just below the flyer is awesome too.",,,
,,great,5,,"Pre paid tickets with Viator. Good view of Singapore, airconditioned so heat not a factor. Took some great photos.",,,
,,Just Okay,3,,"Riding the Singapore Flyer is a great way to get good views of the city. Nice tourist attraction, though, I wouldn't really say it is a ""must-do"". I honestly think that I had greater views of the city from below.

We went there in the evening (and it was raining!). Had no problems with the queue (there wasn't any!). To get to the actual flyer, we went through the ""Journey of Dreams"" attraction - which was free and part of the ticket (well, it better be since there really wasn't that much to see there). We then shared the 30-minute ride with another couple. The glass capsule was very spacious with a long bench in the center. You can move around freely to admire the views and take pictures. The view probably would've looked better during sunset.

The ride was just okay. What I actually enjoyed more were the surrounding shops and dining areas. I loved the Singapore Food Trail - a small themed food street with good affordable local food. The area provides good photo-opp as well.

Overall, I think it was just alright.

Tip: If you are taking Singapore Airlines, you may show your boarding pass when you purchase your ticket for the Flyer and get a discount.",,,
,,Interesting experience,4,,"Singapore Flyer definitely worth a visit, but be prepared to spend some time in line, although it moves pretty fast and there are some interesting displays inside before you board to make waiting in line more fun. I'd allocate at least two hours.",,,
,,Impressive,4,,"Much like everything in Singapore, it's grand and expensive. Fun attractions is very visual and in your face as you travel into Singapore from the airport. But, have fun.",,,
,,"A bit boring, and a bit expensive.",3,,"You pay 30 dollars for 30min ride. Honestly, it has nice views, but its only the marina and the gardens. There is not much more breath taking to see. A bit of a tourist trap",,,
,,Safe n fantastic ride,5,,One of the greatest ride ever coz you not only get to see the panoramic view of SG but enjoy the height above the bay area.,,,
,,Highest Observation Wheel in the World,5,,Plenty to see from up there and very comfortable inside with AC and plenty of room to move around and photograph whatever you fancy. Early in the morning there were no lines and small groups in the gondolas but crowds were building up by the end of the 30 minute 'flight',,,
,,Nice views,3,,Great to do this once but cant repeat it. Make sure you choose your fellow travellers well because if you get a noisy group you are stick with the noise without any escape !!,,,
,,Great aerial view of Singapore,4,,We went on a very quiet day and had a car to ourselves. No line ups or crowds to deal with. Try and go around noon as most of the tour operators seem to take lunch around then leaving less congestion.,,,
,,Great views,4,,"Pick the weather before you go, it's often raining or foggy, and no views. Staff are great, glass was not cleaned so photography was hindered.",,,
,,merry go round!!!!,5,,They have created tourist attraction out of nothing! A big merry go round. you can see the city from the top.and pay 33s$.This is called business innovation.,,,
,,Flying high,5,,"Had an amazing time a total must if going to Singapore,this a good way to see the landscape , it was the holidays so the question where very long but it was worth the wait.",,,
,,amazing view,5,,the view from singapore flyer was amazing..n if u have someone special with u..makes it even better... i wish i had time to view it at evening..,,,
,,BETTER AMONST ALL,4,,Flyer is good place to visit. In night time it's a place where the granduar of Singpore is visible . Highrise are eyecatching and clark quay is adding beauty in it. Affordable with package with other attractions.,,,
,,A GREAT EXPERIENCE,5,,"We thoroughly enjoyed the Singapore Flyer. A word of warning, get ther early to beat the crowds, which is wha we did. We got there at the time they are due to open, and we hafd a car all to ourselves, which was great.
We loved it and are so glad that we did it. We are glad we did it during the day rather than of a night, as we had already been up to the top of Marina Sands and seen Singapore by night, so between the 2 we have seen Singaproe from a height both at day time and also at night time.",,,
,,Great Views and little queues,4,,Wonderful views of the F1 circuit and the Singapore skyline. Not expensive especially if you have a city bus ticket. If so then don't purchase your ticket from the main ticket office go to the bus office which is just across the main hall and you will save a fair bit on the price,,,
,,A great way to view (some of) the City,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is a marval. A true testament to modern day engineering. The complex has a rather nice food court at the base and a spectacular museum (dedicated to the wheel) on the upper floor which features interactive displays and dioramas. The ride was smooth, quiet and cool - giving an awesome view of the Bay Area. Don't expect to see the whole city though (as you would in the London Eye) - because of the exceptionally tall buildings in the city - the views are limited to the Bay Area and surroundings... and of course the ocean with the hundreds of ships anchored.",,,
,,Amasing view on Singapore!,5,,"You should do it at night. You can see all Singapore with night`s illuminations. Very interesting! But, you should know, you can`t take any food or drinks to cabin, except water. For us, it was bad news, because we would like to drink some shampagne on the top of night`s Singapore and took some photos... Pity.",,,
,,"Well worth a visit, excellent views of Singapore",4,,"We were only in Singapore for 2 days so tried to cram as much in as possible. This is well worth a visit. An opportunity to see the sights of Singapore on a clear day. The purchase of tickets and smooth running of the trip made the experience, certainly better than the London equivalent!",,,
,,Awesome,5,,This is a very romantic place and you should try an go there little before sunset. The reason being that you will get a chance to see both the awesome city view before sunset and also after sunset which is fantastic. If you are early and have time you must roam around the bottom of the flyer with has a lovely pond and fish. If the crowd is little less request the attendant to give you one whole cabin instead of sharing with other guests. They do oblige when the rush is not there.,,,
,,Spectacular View,5,,"I was so not looking forward to it. An health issue put paid to any dream of any high altitude career. But was hosing a group of out-of-towners who wanted to do the Flyer. So on the day found myself heading to the Flyer. This is a part of a combo ticket set with the Ducktours. Timed the ride for the twilight hours but unfortunately inclement weather caused the flyer to shutdown.

So went again the next day but near closing time. We had to pass through an interesting mini museum before getting on the capsule. Once inside, we had the option to sit quietly in the middle of the capsule, which I did, or wander around admiring the beautiful picture postcard view of Marina Bay and beyond with the twinkling lights in the distance. What a sight! My guests thoroughly enjoyed the ride and experience. We did not feel the rotation at all. If it was not because it was announced via the speakers we would not have known that we had reached the highest point on the wheel. As for me, the beautiful panoramic sight propelled me out of my seat and stand at the glass window. No issue at all.

My guests said that they would definitely do the flyer again the next time they are in town and I will be more than happy to accompany them. ;-). Well worth the ticket price.",,,
,,Singapore flyer,5,,very good views. Goes slowly and smoothly. We would like to go another round! No queques in monday daytime! very nice expierience.,,,
,,Great Experience,5,,"Had only a very short time in Singapore, in transit, and glad this was the one thing we chose to do. Area was clean and tidy with a variety of food outlets and shopping opportunities. Price was reasonable and staff pointed out that senior tickets were cheaper than the Singapore Airlines deal we had access to. The actual flyer was very impressive and there was no overcrowding of each cabin so well able to see views from all areas without fighting for space with others. The engineering in this attraction is mind boggling. Wished I had had my son-in-law, the engineer, with me to explain it all.",,,
,,Great way to see Singapore,5,,"We took the ""hop on-hop off"" sightseeing bus and got off at the Flyer to investigate. Decided it was worth the money and were not disappointed. The views are incredible so bring your camera.",,,
,,The ride is good but wouldn't be bothered eating there again.,3,,"As our family was in Singapore on Christmas Day, we decided to book our Christmas Dinner on the Flyer. If I had my time over, I would have saved the money to spend elsewhere. The ride was good and I would recommend that for some great views of the constantly changing vista of Singapore.

However, the food experience failed to live up to the PR, in my opinion. Anywhere else, I suspect the ""butler"" would just be called a waitress or server. We are not particularly fussy but there's no way we would have described the food as gourmet. It was actually very ordinary. There was nothing wrong with it but it wasn't worth the money - it was pretty standard catering fare. Nothing special at all. It was also a bit rushed - you have to finish within two rotations, an hour. It cost us $193.62 per person plus drinks.

Our advice would be to take a trip on the Flyer but avoid the eating option. Singapore has such good food elsewhere at a fraction of the cost. It was neither one thing or the other - you were distracted from the view by having to eat quite quickly but the food was not the quality that the price would lead you to expect.",,,
,,A good experience,4,,"Very commercialized but still a nice experience. We enjoyed the great views of Singapore. We were in a time crunch so we tried mango smoothies there (they were great) and also had wonderful chicken and rice at the ""hawker"" food center on site.",,,
,,Big-big-big,5,,If you visit Singapore don't miss the Singapore Flyer. Trip take about 30-35 min and it is unforgetable. Singapore Flyer -biggest in the world and it's really nice to see Singapore from the sky.,,,
,,Flying,5,,We did this on our first day in singapore just to get a feel of how big the city is. A great experience.,,,
,,HIGH ON ENGINEERING ...SHORT ON VISUAL HISTORY THOUGH,3,,"Bigger, slower and hence more and less crowded than the London Eye, the Singapore flyer - Not the Singapore Eye - as the local will point out to you thru clenched teeth , is without a doubt a true engineering spectacle.

But what you see are sky scrappers, sky scrappers and more sky scrappers.

None of the bird's ye view of history that the London eye offers you.",,,
,,Loved it,5,,"I was really looking forward to doing this and I wasn't disappointed. We did it as part of the hop on hop off bus tour and it was a highlight. Spectacular views, very clean definitely worth a visit.",,,
,,will give you best pics captured,5,,the 360 degrees view of singapore can be seen from atop the singapore flyer capsule. it's a value for money. 30 mins of joy and amazing views.,,,
,,Not a brilliant attraction,3,,I Would suggest you head to MBS skypark for a greater view and spending a longer time with your friends and family.,,,
,,Worth the wait,5,,"Although it was holiday time, with queues to most attractions and no-where for my elderly companion to rest while I 'lined-up', this is a sound addition to Singapore's tourist scene.
Pre-knowledge of the time needed and what one could take on'board;' to eat would have assisted an enjoyable viewing. When all were seated at the start , it was cramped. Fortunately people soon moved about.
If you are short of time, then the higher viewing platform at the three towers would be my first choice. We did both and did not be-grudge some 'overlap' of views.",,,
,,Breathtaking view! :),5,,"Though I've been to Singapore many times. I haven't tried this yet until recently last Sept 2011 during the F1 season when I brought my family with me. The Thing you are in is sooo big you can fit 10 people in it and can still move around. We are a family of five but the crew still put a couple with us, fortunately they are both filipinos like us. We rode the fyler around late in the afternoon to early evening. We were lucky enough to have seen the race track of the F1 which just finished and also see the beautiful sunset and the view or gardens by the bay. Love it in here! Will definitely try the evening ride next time :)",,,
,,So so,3,,"Just for experience. Didnt feel the excitement from the ride.. But for the dinner maybe a little different. Nice view for Dinner. For Viewing only, will be too boring.",,,
,,Great view but overpriced,4,,"The flyer is amazing for a view.
But - it's not the best in town but it charges the most. The very strange rooms they have as you walk towards the flyer are confusing and not enjoyable. The capsules themselves are large and you will find yourself (unless you get very lucky) stuck with quite a few other people. The ride itself lasts about 30 minutes. The view is obviously best from the top. However, the first 10 minutes the view isn't great. On the way back down you are facing the harbour which is really beautiful.
Recommend evening - Singapore is much more beautiful with the lights of the city.
Do it once on your first trip to Singapore. Otherwise avoid and head up to the top of Marina Bay Sands for a better and cheaper view.",,,
,,Go on a slow day,4,,"Thankfully we went on a slow day becausae it was a bit rainy. Not foggy, but rainy. No lines at all. We noticed the staff was putting a single family in one big Flyer ""capsule"" but when my friend and I asked if we could have our own as well (nobody was behind us) we were told we had to go with the family in front of us. Screaming baby and made the experience somewhat of a downer.",,,
,,Preferred it to the cable car ride,4,,"I went with wife and 2 kids in December 2012, we also went on the cable car to sentosa. We preferred the Singapore flyer more than the cable car, it is more of a spectacle whereas I did not think there was a great deal to see from the cable car (and it isn't that cheap). Also cable car ride is included in the 1 day sentosa play pass ticket, a ticket worth buying if you're spending time on sentosa. If staying in the city I would say take a taxi to the flyer after breakfast if that suits and when you finish take the tour bus which stops at the foot of the flyer. Flyer is a 30 minute ride, it was ok, if on vacation in Singapore it is one of those things you ought to try.",,,
,,Bird's Eye View of the Marina Skyline,3,,"Great for first-timers in Singapore as the flyer provides a bird's eye view of the marina skyline at every turn. You will be able to spot some of the significant landmarks such as the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Gardens by the Bay, Singapore River, Merlion Park etc.

Tickets for adults are priced at SGD$33 and it took around half an hour to complete the entire round. It will be advisable to take the ride in the evening especially sunsight as the view will be breathtaking. It is easy for us to locate the flyer as you will be able to easily spot it from afar, it is of walking distances from Marina Bay Sands Hotel.",,,
,,Great view,5,,Make sure you have good weather ....the view is great and you have enough time to take pictures. When you are entering - have a look at the constuction details - pretty cool to read.,,,
,,Must see!,5,,Great views over the city. A lovely way to pass half an hour. Was S$33 per adult so quite reasonable.,,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,Takes about 30 minutes to complete and there is a bit of queuing to get yourself sorted. We arrived at 19:00 with a hope of catching the sunset at 19:15 and missed it by 15 minutes. No worries as was great at night but if you do want to be in the air as the sun sets then allow a good 30 minutes from the time you arrive to the time you board.,,,
,,great view,4,,"great ride, 360 view of singapore, marina bay etc. loved it. a little bir pricey, but it was such a beautiful view.. The cycle on the Flyer takes about 30 minutes. my little bro so excited.",,,
,,MUST VISIT,4,,I one must visit Singapore flyer as it gives a bird eye view of the marina bay area and hotel marina bay sands,,,
,,"This is a WOW! experience. The London Flyer is good, but this is the latest!",5,,"The location is brilliant. The bay, the boats, the city, the coverage is really enticing! You must get onto it and enjoy that hour. Don't forget to carry a charged camera, you will want to go click, click, and click! (I messed up with mine and got only my mobile pix to cherish :-(....)",,,
,,Do it at dusk. Amazing views.,5,,"Beautiful views of a staggering skyline. Worth every penny. Try not to get in a pod with noisy children, as we did, as it detracts somewhat from the experience.",,,
,,Wow,5,,We went on the Singapore flyer and because of the time of the year there was no queing and just oursleves and another couple in a capsule. The views are terrific.,,,
,,Great View,4,,The Flyer is worth the trip to see the view and orientate yourself. It's very organised and streamlined to get on and off and very safe for kids. The restaurants around the base are OK but nothing to write home about.,,,
,,One of the best views of downtown Singapore for an affordable price. This is the smoothest ride on a Ferris wheel.,5,,"I took the hop on hop off bus to get here, although a cab would be a better choice if you don't like to wait around for the buses.",,,
,,The tallest Ferris wheel in the world!,3,,"The tallest Ferris wheel in the world, even higher than the London Eye! Although a much-anticipated part of our Singapore vacation, the actual experience was a bit underwhelming.

The Ferris wheel moves so slowly that it started to get boring after a while. They packed so many of us into each cabin that not everyone had a place to sit.

Yes, there were gorgeous views of the cityscape along the bay, but the windows were so dirty and full of handprints that any attempts at photos were pretty much foiled by smudges on the glass.

We did enjoy the Historic Food Trail afterwards for Hainanese chicken rice, oyster omelet, and a snow ball that was akin to Ice Kachang. The oyster omelet was way too oily, but the other two dishes were pretty good.

I also saw Dragon Beard peanut candy--a childhood favorite of mine--but alas, my tummy was too full to pack in another sweet.",,,
,,ReSistance is futile,5,,"This means, me trying to avoid the flyer was a major loss to me. So we neared the end of 2012, my guests were rushing to have a busy day in Singapore before their flight that evening. I managed to fight off the visit to the flyer but had to suggest it this time. We arrived later afternoon early evening. It was still bright enough to see. But that's the point. After half way on the flyer darkness revailed and we had a beautiful view of Singapore at night. Nice relaxing ride with friends trying to grab a picture from many angles and backdrops. It's a must see attraction for entire family. Or you can book a somewhat romantic dinner for a hefty fee. Do the flyer then walk to esplanade to enjoy chocolate delights and waffles at Max Brenner. On unrelated note: if you are buying electronics from places like Lucky Plaza mall or SimLim mall, please make sure to do your research first even on trip advisor as you could fall victim to scams. Just a friendly warning to ensure you enjoy your Singapore experience.",,,
,,Views to Die For!,5,,"This is an experience that is just awesome. The Flyer is taller and larger than the London Eye and the whole experience is treated as if you are about to board a 'flight'.
They first take you through a futuristic area with amazing lighting to give you a perspective on the flyer, its history and construction with awesome 3D displays including a spherical screen projected from the inside (a mini world).
The views from the capsule are breathtaking but make sure you have enough battery charge in your camera - mine ran out early.
We also had a great Fish Spa afterwards ($30 for 30 mins) in the complex and a good american meal at OLearys.
If you use the Hippo Hop on Hop off - you get Flyer discount tickets - which at $24 is better value than the full price $33.",,,
,,Worth the money and effort,5,,This is a world class attraction. Our family of four enjoyed the experience very much. After do the Gardens by the Bay we decided to do the Singapore Flyer. You can walk there but were lazy and feeling hot so we grabbed one of the cheap taxis you get in Singapore. The views you get of the marvelous Marina Bay Area are truly worth the effort. It opens you eyes to the fact that this is the Asian Century and the explosive growth and economic expansion have not been seen before. Who would have guessed Singapore was a third world country some 40 years ago. The Flyer makes a mockery of the malfunctioning wheel we have in my home town Melbourne. Shame on them. Give it a go you will like it and remember there is nothing like it in Australia or this region.,,,
,,Fly with the Flyer in Singapore!,4,,"Finally, we were up the Flyer in Singapore! I feel like being a bird flying above Singapore City with this giant wheel. What a view! It was a clear day when we were up there so we could see far away. I saw the Marina Bay differently from up there and love it. I feel like like looking at many nice postcards at the same time. And when we went there at night on the same day, the light of the City was amazing. So many tall buildings and the light from the streets were so beautiful. I enjoyed every minute up there. You should try it when in Singapore.",,,
,,Good value and great views,4,,we really didn't think the flyer was bad value for money at all and we had amazing views! well worth the trip.,,,
,,Nice panoramic experience,5,,We had a good time. We found it more impressive than London Eye. They had access for wheel chair too.,,,
,,plan for second time,4,,"Well, for the first time we going there, my little son get a nap on his stroller for a long wheel. So, we planned for going once again next March. Is must visit if you never been visiting there, suggest about 5-6 PM I mean is pretty to seen Singapore sunset from the wheel.",,,
,,A great view of Singapore,4,,Great on a clear day. A great view of Singapore. We enjoy it. A little pricey though. The lead up before you get to the ride itself is a little bit cheesy.,,,
,,breathtaking view,4,,"it often amazes me how we love to go up and have a bird's eye view of the earth or part of it and everytime its the same amazing feeling. singapore flyer was no exception. on a clear day even the island of bintam/ batam are visible! and as regards the lovely singapore city, one can really be ensured that no part is left unexplored. though i have not visited this flyer at night but i have reason to believe that it is worthwhile to move "" up above the world so high"" with dalzzling singapore beneath.
i believe it is better to see this within a package , available with many vendors like ""duck and hippo"" etc as it will be cost effective. please consult such tours on net or the tourist information centres located at various places in the city",,,
,,"We thought we were ticking a box, but it was a great surprise.",5,,"We went to the Singapore Flyer as it seemed like the thing to do when you went to Singapore.
However were pleasantly surprised at how great it was. I was worried that I would feel anxious about being enclosed, and being so high, but felt entirely comfortable. The views really are something else and there is something to hold your interest the entire time. My children also really enjoyed it.",,,
,,Best city views,4,,Great for putting the city into perspective. The Flyer should be on the must-do list for first-timers to Singapore as well as for people like us returning after a very long absence.,,,
,,Great attraction.,4,,"We went at 6:45pm and enjoyed daylight, sunset and night time views. Spectacular experience.... 30mins flew by ...we wanted to have another spin at the end of our ""flight"".",,,
,,Worth Doing,4,,"I have been on a few ""big wheels"" in other cities and the Singapore Flyer compares favourably with them.it is apparently the largest in the world, and certainly the pods were comfortable, large and were not overcrowded. There is a rain forest underneath the wheel which is also worth a look.",,,
,,Spectacular views of the city,5,,It has changed alot since the last time we were here during their opening. There is an additonal interesting check in point n a new themed food joint at level 1 which was so interesting that we can't resist trying. Great value with great taste. The management has also include new outlets like F1 themed booth n 4D experience ride. Overall service was Gd n smooth handling of e crowds.. Will b back again after e construction works around the area have completed. I'm sure it will b a totally different skyline view once more.,,,
,,Exceptional view,5,,"The best way to see Singapore from a high point.I advice you to do it or at daytime to really see the buildings and all the architecture And at nighttime, a beautiful experience, with all the light glowing every where !",,,
,,chilled in the rush,4,,"This is a great way to take in Singapore. While visiting any city there is always a fast pace of rushing around catching trains, cabs and walking to the next site. this will make you pause and take it all in during your 30 minute revolution. the capsules are filled with only a few people so the views will be great and you will have an opportunity to take some great photo's. NB you will only get a side view of Marina Bay Sands.",,,
,,Most boring thing I have ever done in Singapore!,1,,"If you are doing the Flyer - Bring your iPad! It's incredibly boring. Exciting for only a few moments, the 1/2hr ride is way too slow.... My 2yo was so bored she started bouncing off the walls. There are better ways to get a view of Singapore",,,
,,Enjoyable experience,3,,"One of the things you have to do in singapore. I believe this is the highest wheel of its type and the view is quite amazing. I went at night and that's when the buildings are lighted up and would recommend all to visit during dusk or later.

There was a huge line and it took us around 25-30 min but it was in December. Seeing the marina bay sands and the gardens by the bay are well worth the price.

Overall definitely visit and get a unique perspective of this amazing city.",,,
,,Great Giant Wheel...,5,,You feel you are at the top of the world. You also see the constantly changing view of the cityscape. It is a rare experience.,,,
,,Not worth 33$ got to Marina Bay Sands instead,3,,"For 33$ for 30minutes ride i would have rather spend that money to go on the top of Marina Bay Sands hotel. The view is the same even better and would cost you 20$ to get up or free Of charge Of you go to tower 3 at Ku D茅 Ta Lounge on 57th floor, but drinks are expensive 16$ for beer , 8$ for sodas, i didn't look at cocktails + 10% service+7% gst",,,
,,Great views at an enjoyable speed,5,,The cabins are spacious and you are able to move around. The wheel moves at a ood speed that allows you to enjoy the views and the ride. Located on the bay you can enjoy some great views of the bay and beyond.,,,
,,Good introduction to Singapore. Do first,4,,Well organised attraction. No queues in January. Moves slowly and you get plenty of time to identify sights. A map is provided with drawings of the various buildings and features so that you can't identify them from the air. The tr really helped us to get a feel for the layout of Singapore and gave a great view of the harbour.,,,
,,Cocktail flight worth the extra money!!!,5,,"Booked a cocktail flight and its worth spending extra money as you get everything exclusive.

Exclusive reception in the flyer lounge which means no queues. Staff escort you to the flyer upstairs exclusively again seperate line from the other public and you also have exclusive themed capsules which is very romantic for couples.

Views are spectacular and amazing. Worth a visit.",,,
,,Nightmare Ride Ended Up In Hospital (and costing me $200+) & If you are scared of heights. Don't do it!,1,,"My experience was single-handedly one of the most traumatic I've had while travelling. It was my last night in Singapore I had an accident at the building of the flyer. The proprietor of the cafe did not offer any assistance as I had hurt myself but after telling the staff on the flyer what had happened I managed (with persistence) to get a manager to talk to. In fact she sniffed her nose at me and continued talking (I did not enjoy the Singaporean customer service).

I ended up being wheeled off the flyer in a wheelchair and slugged $200 for the most expensive hospital in Singapore (closest in the area) and then slugged again another $20 (ish) dollars for the taxi to get back to my hotel.This ruined the next part of my trip.

Unfortunately there is not much that can be done to get my money back because the Singapore consumer affairs won't touch the matter and the Flyer have washed their hands clean of the matter but that is another issue not for this review...all I would say is don't get hurt on it!

Putting aside my personal experience

PROS
I had a private cabin with drinks.

The Singapore Slinger is nice - but if you are scared of heights dutch courage is not going to help.

Reaction time of the staff members.

CONS

This is in the title. If you are scared of heights. Do not ride the wheel. I spent my night in pain and bawling my eyes out because I was terrified of the ride and the horrible experience. Not exactly the romantic night I planned eh?

The view seems to be blocked by buildings - from the photos I've seen since I was too frightened to look around.

Having to literally jump onto the flyer but yet was wheeled out afterwards.

I am really glad I didn't pay for the dinner. An hour in pain plus the heights thing would have set me off a lot more.",,,
,,Great attraction,4,,Went on it during the day took a good 20-25mins on it..great photo opportunity sorrounds u.. The Grand Prix track is just below u and the buildings in the city with marina bay at ur feet.. Great angle to see Marina Bay sands hotel.. Nice experience definitely memorable and a must do!,,,
,,Great Views over Marina Bay,4,,The queues were long but the wait was worth it. Stunning views over Marina Bay and Singapore. I recommend going at dusk and then you can see the whole city light up before your eyes.,,,
,,Champagne and Chocolates with a view,5,,I very much enjoyed my ride and the delicious treats. It may take some time to get on so be conscious of the time and allow yourself a buffer.,,,
,,Slow but a good time pass,3,,"If you are in a romantic mood and want to see Singapore in a glass cabin on a Ferris wheel Singapore Flyer is perfect for you.
Its like a giant ferris wheel moving slowly and slowly for you to take a good look at the city and also its breathtaking landscape.",,,
,,"good view, a lot of people",4,,"first I arrived I found out my ticket a little bit cheaper than they sold at the place. so if you there never buy the ticket at the singapore flyer but buy it at tour counter. on the day I was there, they have a student brand to perform a music with kitchen tools, it's fun and enjoyable before the drive. Because I got on the drive at night so the view was gorgeous and romantic but because of many people on the capsule so you have to share the chair with them sometime you can rest sometime you have to let other have rest.",,,
,,slightly overrated but still very scenic and enjoyable,4,,"I visited at night and there were very long queues. Once I got on the flyer the views were very nice and the ride took roughly 30 minutes. It is a good place to see Singapore from a different angle, night or day.",,,
,,thrills with no spills,5,,The flyer is easy to get to whether by public transport or on the hop on hop off. Queueing to get in isnt much of a bother as youre entertained all the time by an interesting interactive display all the way to the gondolas.As you slowly climb up to the highest oint you relaise what a n archtectural wonder Singapore is. Just for that is is worth a visit.,,,
,,An Excellent View of Singapore,5,,"We were on one of the hop on / hop off buses that stopped at The Flyer so we gave itca go even though the visibility was not the best. It was very easy to get a ticket and there were no queues to get on. We ended up sharing a pod with just two other people, even though they are designed for up to 28, so it was very comfortable and enabled us to walk around freely to take pictures.

Some great views and all the main sights of the City were clearly visible. A great experience and some unforgetable views.

Before you buy your tickets be sure to check out if you are eligable for any discoints or multi buys, there seem to be many available making the visit very good value.",,,
,,No crowds during the morning,4,,"Went here around 9am, not much people yet, there were only four of in one cart. You get 20% off if you have a singapore air boarding pass. Great view, nice experience. Still a bit pricey though. There's a small foodcourt on the ground floor. Walking distance to Suntec city and promenade MRT.",,,
,,Top of the world feeling,5,,"Lovely experience, lovely view. Worth the 30 SGD (tour group rate) for a 28 minute ride. If you so desire you could have your meals here, six tables fit in one of the cabins.",,,
,,wonderful ride. worth the view and time spent.,5,,"minus point, the ticketing is located at the 1st floor. i suggest the ticketing to be on the same floor as the entrance to the FLYER.

plus point, safety given highest priority. the view and experience is fantastic to last the entire ride. prepare a fully charged up camera as you will be treated a awesome view of Singapore, Marina Bay area and Central business district. Plus the recent addition of Gardens by the Bay. Just not enough words to describe! go try it.",,,
,,What a view!,5,,"As adults, we really enjoyed the ride. The flyer travels slowly so you get a great view at all angles; however, if you're traveling with kids (as we did), you are likely to hear the classic 'Are we there yet?""..! Kids may get antsy. The capsule fits around 18 people, and there's enough room to walk around comfortably.",,,
,,Memorable,5,,Been on the London Eye but this was different. Better in fact. We loved it and it was very romantic. Nice local food can be found just below the flyer. Walking to the other Marina Bay areas was a stroll.,,,
,,Spectacular scenery! Great experience,5,,Great view of marina bay. The flyer is bigger than it seems. enjoyed the experience. Great tourist attraction.,,,
,,"Unique view, but should work on the prices",4,,"If you visit Singapore, it is a must, as it gives a unique view. Next best would be from Marina Bay Sands or from the Equinoxe at the Stanford. The only downside is that you make only one round (so limited time to take the perfect picture) and the price is relatively steep. (Compared to the lobby of the Equinoxe where you can go up for free and if you want you enjoy your drinks or dinner there...).",,,
,,Excellent views and pleasant ride,5,,"I was quite surprised to find the very long queue to the Flyer moved very rapidly and once inside the cart there was adequate space to move around, sit etc as they did not cram the cart too full. It made for a very enjoyable, organized experience.
Present your Singapore Airline stubs at the ticketing counter for a discount on their very pricey tickets.",,,
,,Best View of Singapore,5,,The Singapore flyer is a very good attraction providing a birds eye view of Singapore from the Marina bay Area. Great was to see the Gardens on the Bay and an eye level view of the fabulous Marine Sands Hotel Complex.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"It cost about $20, as a pensioner, about $28, I think, if not, and worth every penny. There was heaps of room to sit or walk around whilst this amazing feat of engineering took us up and around, where I was able to take lots of beautiful photos of Singapore from up high. Make sure the skies are clear when you go so that you can get good, clear photos. Takes about an hour and was one of the highlights of our trip to Singapore.",,,
,,Once is enough...,3,,"Yes, you get a great view of the city & the F1 track but I don't think it's worth the money. We went at sunset which was nice. I wouldn't recommend it.",,,
,,Enjoyable,5,,"Even though I am afraid of heights, the Flyer feels very safe and gives such good views of the city and surrounding areas. Lasts about half an hour and quite expensive at S$ 33 per adult.",,,
,,The Best View,5,,The Singapore flyer is very well managed. The night view is much better than the day view. The capsules are not too crowded and you can even experience dining up there which is amazing! Definitely worth seeing...,,,
,,As good as London,5,,Great sites and no queues couple it with a visit to Flight Experience Boeing 737 simulator traing in the same building,,,
,,Good trip.........,3,,Like so many city 'Big Wheels' a great view of the city and harbour. Directly above the Singapore F1 track which was unique. An average price when compared to similar rides. Good value.,,,
,,Lot of other options,3,,"If you wish to have view of Singapore from top their are lot of other options. Yes flyer is good but not great. It's slow and time consuming.

You can always visit Marina bay sands observation desk by paying $20 , mount faber ( cable car to sentosa near harbour front mrt) , tiger sky tower at sentosa, 1 altitude bar, ktu da bar at Marina bay sands.",,,
,,So Borring.,1,,"It was so borring, the line is a trick. They let 6 people out onto the deck so it looks like there is no line, though what they don't tell you is that its a giant building full of lines inside which take a further 30 minutes to get to the front of the line. Once on the flyer you will be amazed.....for the first 4 minutes, the next 26 minutes on the flyer will bore you to tears, and the worst part is you can't get out when you're done. If you're doing it for the views you're better off to vist the observation deck of the C, its about the same price same view and you can leave when you please! DON'T DO THE FLYER!",,,
,,Exactly what you'd expect - great for first-timers,4,,"The ride lasts for half an hour and has very beautiful views of all the major sites in Singapore. Each capsule can hold ~20 people but I didn't see any that had over 6 or 7 people. It's on the expensive side (paid 30 SGD per person) but is well-run and is a great photo opportunity. There are also a few cafes and souvenir shops in the area. If there is no line (there wasn't for me), you should be finished with the whole thing in an hour.

I would suggest going near the beginning of your trip to get yourself oriented with the place",,,
,,Excellent view but poor management,3,,"We were visited to Singapore Flyer and happened when we were requested information at Tours & Transfers office and an Indian lady (she is tour agent) showed unfriendly attitude by saying ""Yea, I'm talking to U!"" repeated twice under we weren't noticeable somebody was talking to us? Wondering, did she showing a polite manner or good customer service to a tourist? As a tourist, we are not familiar with the place and for sure we will ask for further information but not treat by a tour agent with this unfriendly attitude! Beside that, none of any S'pore Flyer staff assist when this unpleasant issue occur! This maybe a minor issue but when major issue occur such as emergency case will any management staff attend?
No doubt, it is amazing scenery unfortunately we were impressed by poor management and unfriendly attitude from a local.",,,
,,Biggest waste of time and money! SOOO disappointed!,2,,"I had been to SIngapore and gone on the Flyer in April 2010 and was thrilled by how informative the head-sets that you received before boarding the capsule were. They explained everything about the Flyer, SIngapore, the layout of all the city buildings and the bay, it was definitely worth my money for the history lesson.

THIS TIME...

I took my husband who had never been, as we start our 3.5 month backpacking trip around S.E Asia. I asked the attendant when we were boarding where our head-sets were and she shook her head (didn't even answer me). I then asked ""is the information going to be broadcast through the speakers inside then?"" and she nodded. We received nothing. No information, just poor, annoying elevator music for the entire 30 minute overpriced loop. My husband kept asking me what each building was, and sadly I couldn't remember... now we'll never know.

The price was also more expensive than it was 3 years ago (which is fine, due to inflation, but I expect the same service, not less for an increase in price).

Don't waste your time, you'll see just as much in the SkyPark on top of Marina Bay Sands.

Our highlight of the whole thing was when we got off the capsule and went to feed the giant fish in the pond below ($1 for a handful of food).",,,
,,Amazing views at night,5,,"Ignore the guide books, the city is so much prettier at night! It has a great view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, so you can see the skypark, the ArtsScience museum and of the course the famous Helix bridge. Worth a visit.",,,
,,Night view better than day,3,,"The price is too steep! Night views are nicer thAn day. Experience between night and day is rather different. Not crowded on Friday night. Queue move quite fast. However, don't like it that they 'force' everyone to take a photo in the queue before going on board the flyer. Would like to try dinning in a capsule though.",,,
,,Another must do,5,,"A truely wonderful experience and very good info with the audio guide, found this very useful for gaining geographical knowledge of Singapore, another Singapore great",,,
,,excellent,5,,its beautiful and view are magnificient and very smooth ride and enjoyable . its always fun going on it and is well priced as well. food is good near i=t and is central,,,
,,A must see view,4,,"The great thing about the S Flyer versus for example the London Wheel, is that it takes longer (around 25-30 mins) so you are not always rushing for a better photo. You can just sit back relax and take it all in. We went at dusk which is the best of both worlds. Enjoy Michael Patrick James Green Saranjuan",,,
,,Views everywhere,5,,"I am not very good with heights, but this is well worth a try. It gives you such amazing views over Singapore and then you can pinpoint other places you want to visit when back on the ground. We had free tickets from having flown with Singapore Airlines.",,,
,,Another big wheel,3,,The views of singapore were spectacular. The 30min turn tends to become a bit tedious at times though.,,,
,,Fantastic,4,,"Apart from authentically Chinese food, Singapore river cruise and flyer are a must- go places. It's pretty nice for a family or couple to have fun together....it's recommended to enjoy the river cruise at late night coz of less people in the boat and night view is the best. U can find day pass ticket and single pass ticket. U can grab a great dinner such as black pepper or chili crab or deep fried cereal prawn ..many more at jumbo seafood restaurant or other restaurant.....after cruise, u still can enjoy the night life.....the night is still young....have fun ,people,,,,,this plan is good for people who reach Singapore in the afternoon and go straight to Clark quay including Singapore river ....Singapore flyer is good for the second day plan....not bad and very unique experience ....",,,
,,Giant Observation Wheel,5,,"Raisiing over 160 meters, stationed at Marina Bay at Singapore , it gives an experience you can never forget. You can view the whole city from that height. This experience is added with dining, shopping , entertainment etc.in the complex. The adult entry fee is S $33 and for child S $21. If you are visiting multiple attractions, like bird park, Zoo, Sentosa island etc. it is better to buy combined tickets which are available at much discounted rates. Family tickets are also cheaper",,,
,,Nice view,3,,"Nice view especially we go there on a sunny day. Since it's just 9:30am, only my husband, my son and myself in the compartment. My son keep running as if he's in the playground!",,,
,,Great view over Singapore,4,,We were there during the day and took many photos . So do not forget your camera!!! We liked great view over Singapore.,,,
,,Be on Top of world!,4,,A different experience; one must have it once a life! Pl be careful with person managing number of persons per capsule; she may tend to stuff capsule with upto 20-28 persons per capsule specially if you are Indians but at the most 2 families (6-8 persons) if Europeans or Americans! and this comes at hefty price!!!!,,,
,,A GENTLE BIRDS EYE VIEW,5,,for my kids it was the best out of all the adventure activities even surpassing the Universal Studios!!! though the weather was not the brightest we still enjoyed the gentle ride while taking in the view with awe,,,
,,Up up and away,4,,Expensive but so is everything else in Singapore. Well worth it. I was not nervous about going so far up as it was a very stable ride. Lovely garden underneath and some fabulous food stores below. Excellent food stores actually. Toilets are clean too.,,,
,,Singapore flyer,4,,"Our visit to Singapore flyer was an unplanned one but we were happy to have taken the decision to spend some time there. And with young kids of age 2 and 6, view of the entire city from the top was simply awesome!!",,,
,,Nice view,3,,"The views are good from the flyer, you get to see most of the city from the flyer on a clear day (and apparently Indonesia too).
The Flyer isn't the cheapest thing we did on our trip, but its worth the money! We didn't have to wait and I'm sure the wait wouldn't be too long!",,,
,,Singapore Skyline at Night,4,,I took this ferris wheel ride during the night to see the Singapore skyline and it was simply spectacular. You can see the Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands side by side. I also liked the souvenir photos taken with the different backdrops. I liked it so much that I bought all my 6 solo photos as keepsake.,,,
,,Over-rated,2,,"Sorry, but a bit over-rated. They should price it lower or throw combined offers with the nearby locations like Gardens by the Bay.",,,
,,"Beautiful View but NOT worth the price, be careful of who is in your car!!",3,,"I took my family on the Singapore Flyer the other night even though I thought the price was fairly high especially considering the ride only lasts 30 minutes. We waited specifically until dusk to enhance the view and we were not disappointed in the views it provided.

I had read some early reviews, namely saying that because of the cost there would be no lineups, wrong! There was a lineup, about 30 minutes, not too bad considering the wait times at Universal but a 30 minute wait regardless. While waiting you are given things to read and see about the Flyer, its construction as well some so called artwork, I guess like other art subject to the viewer interpretation (lol).

I caution you though and with much importance!!!! Be mindful and watch as you approach the entry of the ride or I should say watch the people around you, the people you may have to share your car with!!!! We did notice the people around us but not close enough and more importantly we didn't do anything about it upon entering or refusing to enter and I really wish we had!! We were stuck into a car with namely two families and it was a living hell that we could not escape from for 30 minutes. Right away as the door closed we were plunged into a deafening volume and I gave it several minutes to subside but it just kept increasing. I finally spoke up with a extremely loud and authoritative voice to please use your inside voices, that I did not pay $100 SD to listen to everyone else! It lowered the volume and gave me looks that could kill for several minutes, that was it and the noise level started to rise again.

We had a Indian family with a few unruly and screaming kids who did absolutely nothing to control their children. Also had a Muslim family who were even worse! We've been living in a SE Asian Muslim country in the area now for 6 months and we've never encountered such rudeness or poor behaviour. I was surprised and shocked at the level of disrespect for fellow travellers and people who spent money to also ride the Flyer and enjoy the views.

My wife also spoke up about half way through the ride and it also had little to no effect.

We asked to speak to a supervisor at the end of the ride, we explained to him our experience, he apologized and did offer us another ride at ""No Charge in our own car"" I thought that was nice and honestly probably sufficient. I did write tto the management saying that the supervisors should be given a little more discretion to do more; I thought a partial refund would have been in more order. We chose not to accept it, at that point we were too far gone, too frustrated to possibly be able to enjoy another ride. We have children of our own (two young teenagers) who were with us they also did not want to go again, but I thought it was nice of them anyhow to offer it.

Bottom line is the other guests ruined our $100 ride and view of Singapore! We never allowed our children to act up in public when they were younger, we believed that the rest of society should not be subjected to our children's poor behaviour or tantrums if they were having one. So we we avoid the the public occasion or remove them. I wish other parents and cultures would exercise the same level of respect for other people! I do not want my money wasted or my time frustrated by someone else's poor behaviour and disrespect!

So, its a beautiful view, quite pricey BUT if you see a car full of loud disrespectful baboon's get off and ask for another car.",,,
,,good experience!,4,,views were breathtaking but do go on a clear day. some days you have to wait but the line does does go by quickly. worth the wait for the views.,,,
,,Nice view from the top,4,,"Likes: The View at sunset and at night.. seeing Singapore from the flyer is one of the reason why people come to this place in the first place. if you have ""thick pocket"" you can also try dinner at the capsule. very nice...",,,
,,Great view,4,,"This ""ride"" takes about 30 minutes and gradually moves you (in a capsule that can fit around 20 people) around on the huge wheel to take in the sights of Singapore harbour and city. It's a great view and vantage point. Entry fee was $30 (photo is extra).",,,
,,Sinagpore Flyer,4,,This was a very nice trip. It goes really slow so that you don't even realise you're moving. This gives you plenty of time to take pictures. The cars are really big so if you get in one that isn't crowded you can move around and see everything.,,,
,,The Doyen of Ferris Wheels,5,,Another must-do in Singapore. Capsules are very spacious and comfortable. Fantastic views of course.,,,
,,Fantastic and a must do.,5,,"The flyer is located central to the major local tour operators, it was part of our Singapore Stopover. The views are amazing, overlooking the harbour and F1 circuit, with a visit and would pay fill price to do it",,,
,,hot ride,5,,"first time in singapore and really enjoyed Singapore flyer! Man its huge! it took us to the highest of Singapore and the city looked small yet beautiful. The airport is co big and nice! I love Singapore, i will come back after manila.",,,
,,GIANT WHEEL,4,,"The 165-meter-high Flyer is perhaps Singapore's answer to the London Eye( lot of people may agree atleast purists for sure). It was the world's largest observation wheel till Beijing's version toppled it. despite the talk , less people go to the flyer, some of them complain that it is far but is actually very well connected. rides are for 30-minute, it is generally less crowded & one may not have to wait in long queues. The best time to hitch a ride is at dusk when the entire row of downtown skyscrapers is softly lit. it offers incredible photo opportunities Back on the ground, head for a dinner of chili crabs at Seafood Paradise. you also get discount if you use SIA boarding pass!",,,
,,Magnificent Views,5,,A must for a first time visit to Singapore. A very relaxing time with the opportunity to take great photographs of Singapore. Reasonably priced.,,,
,,"Up, Up and Away",5,,Great smooth ride. Got to see a lot even though the weather was not the best. Remember to keep your SIA boarding pass for a discount.,,,
,,Photographer's Dream,4,,The Singapore Flyer is very slow moving but it's greatest asset is that it is a relatively good value platform for incredible photo opportunities.,,,
,,The Tallest in the World?!,3,,"I tried the Singapore Flyer just for the heck of it :) I rode the flyer evening of December 2nd, 2012. If you're into photography, you can bring your finest camera with you and take pictures of Singapore in the entire 30-minute ride. For me, I brought my point-in-shoot camera with me and was not able to capture the best pictures because of the water on the glass. It rained when I rode the flyer.

I was expecting it would be a scary ride but it wasn't. It moved real slow that you would not feel anything scary at all.

Overall, the ride was quite boring. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes of the ride. I traveled alone but I guess with friends I don't think it's going to be that boring.

I like the airport theme before riding the flyer. The cost is kinda high though for SGD $33.00.

TIP: You can ask your hostel if they sell tickets. You can get it for a discounted price of about SGD $29.00.",,,
,,Must go once to experience a spectacular view of Singapore.,4,,"Confortable, spacious, aircon ride. Price is not the cheapest but acceptable. The views of Singapore is wonderful. Once in a lifetime experience cause don't think I wanna do it again because exploring Singapore on land is better. :)",,,
,,Great view of Singapore from here,4,,"It's a glorified ferris wheel but much nicer. The ride takes about 30 minutes but the way up is so creative, just like checking in for a flight!",,,
,,The only way to see Singapore skyline,5,,"Having experienced the London Eye, I knew visiting the Singapore flyer would be worth each dollar. For a compact city, there is so much to see from the pods; Marina Bay Sands, CBD, Gardens by the Bay, parts of the Formula 1 track, Fullerton Hotel, Sentosa Island and the Singapore Strait to name but a few. Recommend all travellers visit here.",,,
,,Great views and reasonably priced.,4,,"We booked at home before our holiday and used a discount code too so we booked the flyer and boat tour, it was cheaper than paying on arrival.

There was only 8 of us in the capsule so we had plenty of room and could all move about to see different spots, if you've ever been on the London eye you will know they really pack them in.

I'd recommend this to anyone with a bit of spare time.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,We rode this (ferris wheel) on a whim. The price was around $25.00 USD per person. The views from the top were spectacular. The cars were air conditioned.,,,
,,qued far too long,3,,"qued far too long took well over an hour to get to the ride, was not told of the very long ques when buying the ticket",,,
,,Worth Visiting when in Singapore!!,5,,"I had heard so much about it, one of the prominent landmarks in Singapore, absolutely breathtaking view, had the entire capsule for us, definitely recommend.",,,
,,Flying High on the Singapore Flyer....,4,,"As keen photographers, we felt a ride on the Singapore flyer was a must ! Bigger than the London Eye (which we have never been on -shame on us !) it was priced at $33 singapore dollars each for a half an hour ride, and was worth the money for the bird's eye view of the city it gave you. Make sure you do not have your flash on when taking pics inside the capsule. Only around ten people in each capsule gave the opportunity to move around and take plenty of pictures. Took around 15 minutes queuing to get in, and of course the usual gift shop at the end, although surprisingly with some sale memorabilia which made buying a souvenir of our visit more reasonable than expected. Opportunities are also available to hire a capsule for private bottle of champagne with your loved one, or a three course meal. You can take a taxie outsite to your next destination, although there can be a bit of a wait, also on the route for the Hop on Hop Off Bus.",,,
,,Average,3,,"If you are trying out the flyer for the 1st time, you should. For the price paid, the ride is only 30 mins. Avoid rainy days. Night or mornings should be better.",,,
,,Terrific View,4,,"The city state itself, I can say, is amazing. The chance to see the Marina from up high was even better, especially at dusk - which I did. Wow is the only word to describe everything I saw. It's a must thing to do...",,,
,,Don't go when it rains!,4,,"I'd been looking forward to this part of my Singapore vacation since the day we landed - and even though it was raining, it didn't disappoint. We went just as the sun was going down. If it wasn't raining, the view would have been fantastic. The Flyer gives a 360 degree view of the city - a must do when you visit!",,,
,,Great view,5,,I had a fun and exciting day when i tried the flyer. It was really exciting to be on top and see a great view os SIngapore and neighboring Malaysia.,,,
,,Amazing Thing to visit,5,,200 mtr above in a glass capsule viewing one of the most beautiful city of world. everyone can judge the feel in it. a must must go. tickets 33s$ per person,,,
,,Great Views,5,,"The singapore flyer gave some outstanding views and a different perspective of the city. We went during the day but I can would imagine at night it would be a totally differnt experiance, but still really enjoyed the views.",,,
,,Something should be experienced,4,,The Singapore Flyer is one thing you definitely experience if you travel to Singapore. It gives 360 degrees view of the city. The entrance passage takes you a journey which describes about the idea of Singapore Flyer. More importantly after the ride you can enjoy the traditional Singapore style Hawker's food trail down there.,,,
,,Best experience,5,,So high above the ground and enjoying the city Skyline like never before.. Must visit only at night.. Too good to see the skyline.. Beautiful experience really..,,,
,,very nice high tea flight,4,,"We were a group of 4, booked the high-tea flight, a special capsule ride at 15:30. It was quite worth the money we pay, S$45 each and got 10% discount as we booked from its official site. The service was superbe. We were waiting at the guest lounge, having a special treatment all the way and enjoying the 30-minute ride full of snack (eclairs, canap茅, mini cakes..) and tea of course. We were lucky as there were no other passengers but 4 of us, though it could cramped to be maximum 16 persons for high tea flight. Perhaps because it was during weekdays.. Overall service is great.",,,
,,Magnificent View,5,,I was given a senior discount. Ticket office asked if I was old enough. Very tactful. It was not scary at all. The capsules are big and move slowly to give you a magnificent view. The entry way has a lot of interesting things along it and there are lots of good food outlets at the center. Well worth the money.,,,
,,Very cool,4,,Saw one of these in London on TV. There are some very good views up there. Worth the price. Hardly felt like you were moving.,,,
,,Fun way to see Singapore at a glance,5,,"This is a great way to see amazing views of Singapore. it is essentially a huge ferris wheel that is enclosed and does move very slowly, so plan for 1 hour to visit. But it is worth it, with so many great views of an amazing city! (It is just like the London Eye, if you have done that.)
They do offer some fun offerings, like a champagne flight, a dinner flight, and other options for more than just a ride, so check into the options if you want something with a bit more to it than just the ride.",,,
,,A Magnificent View of Singapore from the Flyer,5,,"If you want to look at Singapore or at least their business district area from above then riding the Singapore Flyer is highly recommended. I love the idea that they do not only focus on making it a carousel ride but instead they added several themes on some of their capsules.

One can have a romantic date inside the Singapore Flyer capsule as they provide you with a four course meal inside the capsule. The idea of proposing inside the flyer really comes to mind.

They also have a party theme capsule where you can have a cocktail party inside the flyer capsule.

The standard capsule however is already enough for me as i was able to see Singapore at night.

The ride took about forty minutes and it was really exciting, my friends who are afraid of heights were able to overcome it because they cannot resist looking at the magnificent view.

Tip: Ride the Singapore Flyer before Sunset for a breath taking view.",,,
,,The Joy ride,4,,"Amazing experience.though i had tried the london flyer also but this is much more memorable an experience,the whole passage to the flyer amazing lighting...photos..the view from the flyer particularly amazing.sea F1 track the amazing architecture..MY SUGGESTION for all those who go on package trip,purchase your tickets in advance from your home county tour operator,its much cheap & you don't waste time there standing in the ques.
Don't miss a must visit.",,,
,,A must,4,,"We were very excited to ride The Singapore Flyer, especially my 3 yo daughter. It was a great experience, especially seeing the Singapore skyline as the sun sets. Very beautiful indeed. I think 5:30 pm is the best time to ride it. Weekdays preferably because there is a very short queue. Rather expensive though for a 30 minutes ride. Before you ride, they will take a picture of you, later they will give you a choice of background to go with your potrait. I suggest just choose 1 as souvenirs.",,,
,,Good views of the city,4,,"I would recommend taking your out-of-town guests to the flyer at the beginning of their stay. It offers great views of the city. My husband and I took a ride at sunset during the F1 race, and it was beautiful. We had the cart to ourselves, which was also nice.",,,
,,The best way to get your bearings when in Singapore,5,,"We went late afternoon before dusk but I've been told that at night Singapore puts on a spectacular light show.
The cost wasn't all that expensive when you compare it with any other tourist spot about S$100 approx for 2 on concession and one full fare.
A great way to get your bearings when your spending a while in this City and spectacular views.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer the best for the best view.,5,,The best way to get your bearings on Singapore and chose what you want to see. It is air conditioned so you escape the heat of the day but the best time to visit is late afternoon. You can see a long way when you are up high.,,,
,,"It is what it Is, no more, no less",5,,"I rate it excellent because it was exactly what I expected. The views were incredible, it was fun, relaxing and great time to take photos.",,,
,,Great Views Singapore Flyer,5,,Was a little scared because of the height factor but as long as I didn't look down it was ok. Great views.,,,
,,Great view but slow,4,,I admit the view was fantastic but it took so long to wait and to get back down that I couldn't wait to get out.,,,
,,Best view in Singapore,5,,"Think London Eye, but bigger, with view as far as Malaysia and Indonesia on a clear day. Excellent exhibits to see before 'flight.'",,,
,,Very slow moving wheel,3,,"It doesn't feel too much like it's moving..... because it's moving extremely slowly. The journey before you step into the cabin is quite cool.... you get to see and explore some technology related things to the Singapore Flyer and small little facts. However, there's nothing much when you step into the cabin.... just look around at the view outside and before you knew it, the short journey would have ended already!",,,
,,Birthday Ride,5,,"We booked the Flyer from Australia on Viator. We did the night dinner trip which is 3 course meal and 2 rotations of the flyer. Expensive to buy and take alcohol onboard. Meals was average, but the nights views were fanatastic.",,,
,,Total tourist trap,3,,You can get the same view from any of the top floor bars in the city without having to drag yourself over to the Flyer. Big and ugly with great views of the Tankers in the bay. The Flyer shut down in 2007 and it took six hours to get people off it. I would much rather drink a $40 Martini and take the elevator down!!!,,,
,,Eye in the sky,5,,"Its a wonderful experience and even for a person who is afraid of heights this should be a soothing experience. Only problem is you have to get in to the capsule while its moving. For a typical person or a child this would not be a issue at all. But if you have elders travelling with you, please ask for assistance from the staff there. They are really helpful!!!!",,,
,,A Must Try,5,,Great view....a must try...food is available in the Flyer terminal and also to try the Duck and Hippo Tour...it's a one of a kind experience!,,,
,,The biggest in the world!,4,,"It is definitely worth doing, although it is not that cheap. But it is the biggest dipper in the world!the view is fantastic! But the weather should be fine, because you won't be able to see everything in a rainy day)",,,
,,best Ever,5,,better than london eye must try...takes bait of time the view is great. just need to enjoy and later eat around the area,,,
,,Well run ride offering super views of Singapore,5,,Singapore flyer which is currently largest ferris wheel in world is well located to give good views over Singapore. It is wee run with plenty to see along route to flyer. Pods are extemely spacious and air conditioned,,,
,,Beautiful view of the Marina district,5,,"Going up the Singapore Flyer is an experience to remember. Back in 2008 when I first rode it, most of the Marina district, eg, Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by The Bay etc, were still very much in construction stage. Hence, the ride back then, while good, didn't really quite awe. But now, I'm pleased to report that the views are absolutely beautiful with everything more and less complete. The Marina Bay Sands is an iconic structure, when viewed at the top most peak, is a magnificent building. You have to see it to believe it.",,,
,,Fantastic views over Singapore,4,,amazing views - assuming you go on a clear day! Definitely worth doing - combined with a sightseeing bus tour gives you a good overview of the city layout,,,
,,Visit if you have nothing to do.....,3,,"My 2nd visit to Singapore flyer. The first was for the dining experience. It was a bit pricey and takes you 2 rounds. The Second time was yesterday.....

A few tips:
1. Buy the tickets on the ground floor where the taxi drop off point or opposite Subway. Tickets are at $33 (adults) and $21 (child).
2. At the moment, there is a promotion of $15 ( student fare with valid student id, applicable to Singapore schools only ) and as for adult, if you have passion card it's $25.
3. Boarding at 2nd floor, you have to walk thru a metal detactor similar to the ones at airport. Seriously even the lady who scan you bags has the same scorn look!
4. The ride is a relaxing 30 mins ride 1 round.
5. The is a Singapore food trail which has some hawker fare for the hungry.

You can include Singapore flyer in your itinerary together with Helix bridge, MBS,Gardens by the bay and Merlion. That will take about a day.

Hope that helps.

Thanks.",,,
,,Boring,3,,"The flyer was a bit of a let down for me although my friends (from abroad) actually enjoyed it alot, although we all agreed it is overpriced for what it is. Doubt I will go back but if you like city views and dont mind paying, this is ok.",,,
,,A little over priced,3,,The flyer is one thing I was told I must do when in Singapore but I was a little indifferent about the whole thing if you have been on one big wheel you have been on them all. At $33 it was an expensive ride when you can pay $20 to go up higher at Marina Bay Sands and get a better all round experience.,,,
,,"Awesome, must visit",5,,"This is a must visit place, which is missing in most of the readymade packages. Great view, nice place.",,,
,,Magical views of the Island,4,,"Try go just before sunset, and if you're lucky you might get some of the most magical views of the island. There is also a good selection of eateries at the Flyer ground levels and a short walk will bring you to the Marina Square area which is convenient for shopping and food as well",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,A fascinating experience with fantastic views of Singapore. Well worth the money. Its slow so you can take many photographs and you don't miss anything.,,,
,,"An excellent attraction, great views of Singapore",3,,"This is a gentle ride above the city skyline and based on the London Eye. It takes around half an hour to complete a circle. It affords excellent views but for my money I'd hit the Sky Park at Marina Bay Sands.

It has specialty cabins for dining or champagne celebrations.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Amazing experience, an absolute MUST see place to visit! The cost is reasonable and the views are stunning.",,,
,,Expensive ride! Just go once will do!,3,,"I thought that the ride was too slow. Fortunately we had almost the cabin to ourselves, there were a group of 5 of us, with another group of about 4 people. There were many opportunities to take photographs. We didn鈥檛 purchase the photograph that was taken officially before we boarded the cabin as it didn鈥檛 seem 鈥渞eal鈥?and it was just too expensive.",,,
,,good view,3,,"Not really special . but can have a good view in more higher . its ok for half an hour. Try once, but not planning to go again ....lol",,,
,,Elderly Friendly,4,,Took my 85 year old mum there and was very impressed with the wheel chair service -staff were very friendly and accommodating --well done Singapore,,,
,,Pick a clear night,3,,"One of those things to do once, just like the London Eye. The views are impressive on a clear night. Just make sure you go to the loo first.",,,
,,Good view of city,4,,"We enjoyed the 30 minute ride on the Flyer during our recent visit. The cabins are solid and people can move around inside. It goes around slowly enough for all to enjoy. The view is good, from a height. But the same can be had also from Sky Park on Marina Bay Sands for similar ticket prices, without a time limit. Ticket prices a bit steep. But an enjoyable experience and would recommend to all.",,,
,,Fantastic panoramic views,5,,This was a wonderful experience and very good value. The views are amazing - looking out to sea to the HUNDREDS of ships waiting to dock and load or unload their cargoes. The view over the city at all the skyscrapers and of course the view of Marina Bay Sands - a definite to-do in Singapore. A little hard to access on foot - lucky you can see it from some distance as sign posting on the route we took was patchy,,,
,,Do check this out,4,,"Amazing views, well maintained, reasonably priced and the right duration, makes the Singapore Flyer an enjoyable experience. Do remember to take your cameras with you.",,,
,,Experience,4,,"I had visited the ""London Eye"" and the ""Singapore Flyer"" by the seaside, overlooking the whole Singapore foreshore and sea is a good experience; feeling the open space surrounding and cool sea breeze.",,,
,,Top View,4,,"Fast becoming an icon, the glamourised Ferris wheel gives you a bird's eye view of the Marina Bay Area and much more on a clear day. Best time to take the ride is 10 minutes before the sunset, so you can see both the day and night scenes from on high. You can even have dinner while you ride it.",,,
,,Fantastic view of Singapore Bay & City,5,,"A must visit if you're in Singapore. Flyer has got great view of Singapore Bay, Merlion, Downtown, Sands Bay Hotel and other places. I would suggest to take the flight at the time of Sunset which gives a memorable experience. I would also suggest to carry a good quality camera & lenses to click few amazing photos.",,,
,,Top Singapore Attraction,5,,"We went on the Flyer on a Wednesday lunch time and there was no queues which was a very good start.

Great views all around Singapore and the flight itself isnt too long that you get bored or too short that its over too quickly.

$33 was a sociable price.

Should I go back I probably would try it at night time.",,,
,,Flight Experience Singapore,5,,I have been on the London Eye twice and the Singapore Flight certainly compared to that experience. My only comment is that a companion and I had trouble in finding the entrance to the Flight and had several false starts before finding it.,,,
,,just OK,3,,"the ride lasted for only 30mins, we enjoyed walking in the hallways to the entrance of the capsule and the nice sunset view.. but nothing much to miss if you will not try..",,,
,,"Brilliant views, as good as the London eye..",5,,"Loved this flight, takes about 35 mins to complete one revolution, but the views are excellent, we went mad with the camera, and have some superb memories of Singapore... It must be amazing at night. If you want something a bit different and you don't minf heights.. then go for it...",,,
,,Brilliant views over Singapore,4,,The Singapore Flyer is a great way to see fantastic views over Singapore. Perhaps a little pricey though but worth it in my opinion.,,,
,,nothing extraordinary,4,,just for fun can try but nothing much even u skip it..to see whole of singapore marina bay sands skypark is much much better,,,
,,"Great experience, see for miles",5,,"Only four of us were in our capsule on the flyer so plenty of space to walk around looking out in all directions and taking photo's. The wheel spins very slowly, giving ample time to enjoy the experience. We bought a fridge magnet photo which is taken of you as you enter, a nice memento. Would recommend.",,,
,,More fun than a revolving restaurant,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is one of those attractions, like Waikiki and Disneyland, that most sophisticated travelers reject as crowded and tacky and touristy but that most of us can't help liking. What's not to like? The views of the city, the harbor, and the oceans and islands beyond are stunning. The compartments are far more solid and secure than in an ordinary ferris wheel. In my experience the lines are not long on weekdays, and fellow travelers -- mostly but not exclusively families and young people -- have either kept to themselves or improved the experience with their infectious enthusiasm.

The ticket prices do seem a little steep at first -- S$35 or roughly US$28 for adults -- but think about it: the Flyer is almost as much fun as a helicopter, and way more fun than a revolving restaurant, at a fraction of the price of either.

It's also easy to get to: just a seven-or-eight-minute walk from the Promenade MRT station, and quite close to Marina Bay hotels and the Marina Square shopping center.",,,
,,Excellent,5,,"We have been on this twice now, it was good to see the changes of Singapore after two year gap. Next time we are in Singapore we will go on it at night time. I am not a lover of heights but was not worried at all on the Flyer",,,
,,Singapore,4,,"Singapore, Is the place to be, if you got a day stopover in singapore have a lot of things to do during the day and upto midnight.
Go to the nearest tourist information desk at singapore airport and get information. all the tourist things from shops (suncity) to resturants/ferry rides/sentosa island/day/night zoo all highly recommands, if you got time between flights.
The people in singapore are very friendly and helpfull people and they do go out of their way to help. Singapore is The Place to Be.",,,
,,Give it a miss,3,,"Would be ok for first time visitors to get a view of Singapore. For those that have been before, go to Marina Bay Sands skylark for a better view and experience.

The flyer is very crowded and I shared a carriage with 10 Very noisy (admittedly happy) others.

VERY touristy and not worth the ticket cost",,,
,,Love at lst sight,5,,Everything is just beautiful..nothing can be compare against the sightseeing from there. Especially with someone special and spend the night with him...,,,
,,One of the Best view of Singapore,5,,"this is a new additon in SIngapore, and it gives you some amazing shots of the Singapore Skyline, the ticket costs you around 35 Singapore dollars, the ride is of 30 minutes , with some decent shops and eateries, it is a place worth visiting, specially for those coming to Singapore for the first time.",,,
,,Bigger than the London eye- best views of Singapore from the air,5,,"Did not realise how big this structure actually is until we boarded the capsule- only 4 of us occupying a pod that will probably accommodate 20+ people with ease. Takes a good half hour to do a full rotation so plenty of time to take photos. We got a discount for having previously travelled on the City Sightseeing buses,but could be an expensive trip if you pay the full price",,,
,,Fabulous views of Singapore on a clear day,5,,Quite expensive SGD33 per person but included as a free attraction on the Singapore Airlines Stopover package. We were lucky to have a clear day and the views were wonderful.,,,
,,Singapore Must!,5,,"This is a one time Singapore must! I say one time because I would not do it again, but I'm super happy I did it once.

The view is amazing, the ride is 30 min long (which is a bit slow or long). The best time to do this in my opinion is around 645. That way on the way up, it is daylight. Then on the way down it is dusk. So you get to see it during the day and night.

They also have nice restaurants options at this attraction with lots of clean restrooms.",,,
,,Night in the sky,4,,"We enjoyed this ride with our friends, once on board you can see all of Singapore. It was a good way to see it all in Singapore.",,,
,,What a blast!,5,,"It was a Singapore highlight for us. We arrived at the Flyer at 9:30am on a Tuesday and the skies were clear and sunny. Whether it was just good luck or good timing but no one else was waiting and we got a capsule all to ourselves, YAY! We took so many photos and videos, the view was just amazing. A MUST DO! By the way, the capsules are air conditioned.",,,
,,Best Time In Day To Visit Singapore Flyer 1800 Hours,4,,Singapore Flyer One of the prime Attraction of Singapore Tour as per my knowledge and observation the best time to visit Singapore Flyer is About 6 O Clock 1800 hours in the evening why when you board the Singapore flyer it will be in sun light and you will be able to click photographs and videos in day light as you know it will take about 40 mins to take one whole round in the middle of the time around half fast 6 1830 hours sun set starts and you will be able to view the beauty of Singapore in lights as well so in one single ticket you will be able to see the beauty of Day as well as night if you visit Singapore Flyer at around 1800 hours. In The flyer you can take food and water as well. Singapore Flyer is really a soothing place and will put you top of the world. Must Visit Must Enjoy!,,,
,,Excellent view of Singapore,5,,A must to visit place in Singapore. Excellent view and night life is good around the place. Fireworks near by too. This is the place to be. Not much crowded and does not take much time to go and fly too. :),,,
,,great view,4,,"if you want a bird's eye view of singapore, this is the ride to take. we went in the afternoon so that we could see the sights. i would imagine, however, that the view would be much more spectacular at night because all the landmarks and attractions would be lighted. even if you have a fear of heights, you can still get on this ride because it's enclosed so you feel safe. the flyer moves very slowly so you barely feel it and you don't get dizzy. the souvenir items at the gift shop are also reasonably priced if you want a memento of your visit.",,,
,,Wonderful place to see sunset,4,,I happen to visit the flyer something around the evening so manage to catch two different view of Singapore city. Prior to this I did not know that there can be two different face to the same old city I grew up in. Would encourage people interested in going on the flyer to go around the time when the sun is about to set.,,,
,,Go day and night,5,,If you want views of Singapore's skyline this is the place to be. No queues and good hawker stalls for food around the entrance,,,
,,simply stunning,4,,"although a bit afraid of heights i thoroughly enjoyed our ride on the flyer, my wife was not as thrilled as myself and sat on the seat just looking straight ahead, the view is stunning and i reckon it would be brilliant at night, you are given ear phones on getting in the capsule which holds about 10-12 people and are given a commentary of the sights.",,,
,,Great view!,5,,"I live in Singapore and I take all my guests to the flyer, it is a great way to see Singapore , specially the financial center, the Marina Bay Sands and the Gardens by the Bay.",,,
,,Fly High...,4,,"Rode the Singapore Flyer on the last day of our two night stopover in Singapore en route to Oz.
Great views over the bay, the City and of course Marina Bay complex. Good way to get some perspective on Singapore. A really good thing to do on the last day.",,,
,,View of Singapore city from about 500 feet above,3,,"Though claimed as one of the main attractions, one may not find it very exciting or worthwhile after the 33 S$ ride of 25 minutes. The horizontal from shaped cabins rise very slowly from base level to apx 500 ft to the top giving a 360 degee view but since the location is one end of the city, only the Marina Bay Area is viewable. But my personal opinion is to view the beauty of that area walking along the bat shore to get the real views rather than from this flyer.
Overall some nice views for photography from higher point but still not worthwhile and value for ones money and time.",,,
,,Beautiful View,3,,"This is a copy of London eye, with more and better technology used in there...although i would prefer London eye more, for its scenic view on the westminister and its prefect positioning to view the entire city......Singapore flyer is a good one too...but still needs other places around to be more developed to make it more scenic",,,
,,Fly fly,4,,"Wonderful view of Singapore,slow speed of rotation making it a wonderful experience to enjoy.good to have ur family on board and enjoy.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"Come here in the evening is best, it looks like you can see the panorama of Singapore. You can also set the whole cabin for 2 people with a light dinner is very romantic.",,,
,,Sky view of Singapore,3,,Having been to the London Eye found this not so exciting as while you get to see Singapore a lot from the top but it is buildings and the sea. Unlike you see many more important things atop the London Eye. I would thus say a travel to the Marina Hotel is perhaps cheaper and better.,,,
,,Worth To Try,3,,"If this was your first time to go to Singapore, you could put this object on your list. The admission fee is not too expensive. The best time to ride Singapore Flyer is between 5-7 pm when the sun is still there but not too bright anymore. If you ride it in the evening time when it's dark already, you could only see colorful lights. They are beautiful lights of course, but I prefer to ride it in the afternoon time. They also provide dining experience inside the flyer, honeymooners or couples will like it. How to go there: take MRT, alight at Promenade Station and take exit A. Take 10 minutes walk to reach Singapore Flyer entrance.",,,
,,Views from the top,5,,"An attraction that will give you amazing views of all of Singapore, towards the city, over to the outlying islands and all of the housing skyscrapers built around the city. Well worth while the walk to get to.",,,
,,Good view,5,,Good view of the Singapore City. The price could have been somewhat reasonable. To us it appears very very high price.,,,
,,great views of the city,4,,"I only went on the flyer because it was part of an evening event for a conference I attended in Singapore. I'm not sure I'd fork over the S$30 to go on my own. But the experience was pretty special in the end. The timing of our ride could not have been better, right at dusk. The lights of the city came on as we made our revolution around the flyer (takes about 40 minutes) and it was pretty spectacular",,,
,,A must do!,5,,"You cant go to Singapore and NOT ride the Singapore flyer - we picked the perfect time to ride. It takes approx half an hour to do a full rotation so we had daylight on the way up and then the lights came on and the city lit up on the way down - amazing views, clean pods and great set up. I would have liked a commentary playing in the pod while we went around. It was just me and my 9yr old daughter and i will admit being that high was a tad frightening and the distraction of some background noise would have been good instead being able to hear the wheel creak! ;)",,,
,,Best view of the city's skyline,5,,"We went mid-week in the late morning, faced no queues . The flyer was a slight walking distance away from the nearest Bus station (10 minutes) . We wanted to visit the Flyer + collect the day passes for Singapore destinations.

The mall in which the Flyer Boarding takes place is itself very pretty.There was a Punjabi restaurant in the mall too but with buffett only. There is a museum on the way to the Flyer with a funky lighted up passway. Anyways , coming to the Singapore Flyer - the views are superb. On 1 hand the city meets the sea , with so many ships out there. And on the other some of the smartest sky scapers of Singapore, the Marina Bay Sands, The gardens by the bay , the grand prix with racing cars in it... Due to the glass cabins, photography opportunities are awesome. its a must do activity when in Singapore. Preferably in the daytime.",,,
,,Good but nothing Extraordinary,3,,It was a so-so experience may be because it was raining and there was too much crowd. The school holidays began and may be that was the reason.,,,
,,Flying high over Singapore,5,,"The Singapore Flyer can be easily accessed from the Promenade MRT station.

We visited at night and had a great experience. We purchased the basic admission ticket at a cost of $33 (SGD) each although there are a lot of other packages options available.

Photos are taken of each group before getting on the ferris wheel and you have the option to buy your flyer themed photo at gift shop on the way out.

Pods are spacious and the friendly staff do not overcrowd them so there is plenty of room to move around and take photos during the 30 minutes onboard.",,,
,,Bird's eye view,4,,"Though the same concept just like the London eye, you can't beat the beautiful skyline and the clear waters of our Singapore river! Offering views of F1 night race track, barrage, MBS too!",,,
,,Not for people scared of heights,5,,"Great experience, went mid week and there was no queue, views are breathtaking, make sure you bring a map, possibly binoculars. We check the Grand Prix site which is right under the Flyer, it looked very small though. We walked to the Flyer from the Gardens by the Bay, it took us about 20 minutes via Marina Bay Sands.",,,
,,good view,3,,its a must do to say that you have done it. but nothing too thrilling. would have been nice to do the dinner in one of them though,,,
,,Singapore Flyer.,5,,"It was such a nice experience , the view is gorgeous . I was happy it wasn't a carnival ride , it went slow enough , so you can watch Singapore.. Beautiful.",,,
,,just so so..,4,,one main attraction in s'pore.. must visit but after a while it gets bored.. nice view try 2 combined ticket with another attraction 2 get discount,,,
,,"Typical Wheel, just bigger.",3,,"You can see almost all of Singapore; this is a must try for tourists. However, for me, one time is enough. Nothing so special except for the great great view from the sky!",,,
,,An Evening Up in the Sky,4,,"As the evening sky fall into the night, we step into one of the carriage with some other interested people. As the carriage move steadily upward at a slow pace, we could see the glamous of Singapore night's scenes. It was beautiful indeed, especially when we reached the maximum height. As we explore the views, every moment we can find new interested spots at the surrounding. Worth the time and money spent.",,,
,,"Good view, too expensive",3,,"It's a good way to get a view and is clean and comfortable, but too expensive to ever to more than once.",,,
,,No LCD's no commentary,2,,"We entered the capsule with high hopes guided by the crew only to find no commentary and no working LCD's in the capsule. We even called the operator pressing the emergency button after we realized we were ripped off 125 SG$ only to be told that they were under maintenance. Well in that case why were we not told about that at the ticket window ? When we took up the matter with the supervisor, he told us a new story that the lcd's and commentary were not working only in our capsule...In which case, why did the volunteers guide us into the faulty capsule. Moral of the story: We were given freshly cooked and false stories.
So please make sure you ask whether the commentary and LCDs are working before you go for this expensive 'ride'.",,,
,,Beautiful night views over Singapore,5,,"I am scared of heights, but decided to be brave and go on the biggest Obervation Wheel in the world. We went at night time and I think that was probably less scary than a day time ride. The view was amazing!
You have to jump on and off the ride as the pod is moving, that way the wheel never stops on its revolution.
We only had one other family in the pod with us, the husband was an Aussie ex pat from Perth, who lives in Singapore now. We chatted and they pointed out landmarks and answered our touristy questions. The 30 min ride goes quite quickly timewise, but you hardly notice the wheel moving. I didn't mind going up and coming down, but once at the top, my palms did get a little sweaty and I sat down for a while. (I think that was because we were ON TOP of the wheel, not so much hanging off it)
We got some great photos!
There are shops, eateries and other services around the base just in case any of your party decide not to do the ride.",,,
,,Woow! Wooooow! Wooooow!,5,,"We've visited it around 08 pm, the view of Singapore from the Flyer is breathtaking.
As it was on an evening, there were not many tourists around so they've put as alone on a cab. UNIQUE!
The trip takes about 30 minutes, it is not very cheap but I recommend it to everyone that can afford it.",,,
,,A Must For Tourists,4,,"We recently spent a long weekend in Singapore, as tourists this time, not on business as usual. So we decided to do as many things that tourists normally do. The Singapore Flyer located just a stone throw away from the Marina Bay Sands and an easy walk from the Promenade MRT station. For 20 SGD you can take the gondola for a nearly 30 minute ride and enjoy breathtaking views of the city. This is a tall ride, so be prepared. There are also many interesting things to see while you get to the ride, lots of information. A must for any tourist as long as you are not afraid of heights.",,,
,,the giant wheel,4,,"i have been to singapore recently along with my wife and we we loved the singapore flyer attraction. the ride was smooth and good views from up there. but the food trail outlets down there werent good. we even went on a duck tour which is a amphibious vehicle which goes on land and water, which was good. just at the entrance i found a shop which rents out Ferrari and Lamborghini. i drove a Lamborghini though it costed me 300 singapore dollars, i enjoyed it.",,,
,,Time of year important,4,,"This is a great attraction but you need good weather to get the best out of it.If you are lucky,spectacular views of Singapore and Malaysia.",,,
,,"Worth doing, especially at dusk",5,,"A trip on the Singapore Flyer is well worth the SGD 30.00 charge. You'll get a great overview of the city and the frantic harbour. The pods are comfortable and, of course, air-conditioned. The trip takes about a half-hour and you move impercepibly slowly, giving plenty of time to enjoy. The staff are friendly and helpful, as you'd expect in this city. I'd recommend the trip be timed for just before dusk, so you can enjoy a sunset and watch the city light up for the night. Would be fantastic to watch the F1 Grand Prix from there, if one could afford the tickets, as it looks right down on the pits and home straight!",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"A one of a kind experience! The ride moves nice and slow so you get a great view of Singapore and the surrounding areas. Did not have to wait in line at all. The way to the ride is full of interesting tidbits of information about the Flyer. Take advantage of discounted fares for students and seniors, you'll save quite a bit. The ride itself is 30 min, but the attractions on the way in and out can take up ATLEAST another hour.",,,
,,"Since it is the biggest one in the world, worth taking a ride...",4,,"Provides great views of the city. We did not have to wait too much in line. Aside from the ride itself, the exhibition which talks about its specifications and construction is interesting. Yet, for me the Jewel Cable Car Ride to Sentosa still beats this one. I would suggest doing this first, then walking over to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel to discover more.",,,
,,Take a tour instead,2,,"We bought the most basic ticket, which just involved making the loop in a pod. I may have enjoyed the experience more if the weather wasn't as overcast, but I just didn't think it was worth the time or money. I much preferred seeing the sights up close.",,,
,,See the entire Singapore on Flyer,4,,Nice place for once. It has options to even have private dine while on the wheel. Awesome experience,,,
,,must do list !,5,,"the price u pay some say too much but its worth it, nice slow trip going round you get to see everything, marina bay sands is taller but this is relaxing., great views as i said must do.
we booked a city tour with flyer trip tour was excellent we went to merlion site, then to business district,then to budist temple and to botanical gardens too walk around and indian market strip shops then back to finish off at the flyer.",,,
,,Expensive but worth a visit,5,,At 20SGDs plus its expensive for a 20 min ride but if you havent done a flyer before this is quite good.You get a expansive view of the city.Try going after sundown to take in the night skyline.,,,
,,Perfect for both day and night!,5,,We were guided well by few friends at Singapore. We chose the 6:30pm slot for the half an hour round of the flyer. This way we could see Singapore in the day light as well as little bit of it when the lights were on. The evening sky looks really pretty. It will be better to to buy the tickets in advance so that when you reach you don't have to stand in two lines. A must must visit when visiting Singapore!!,,,
,,A must-do when in Singapore,5,,At least once you should have done the Singapore Flyer. A thirty minute long astonishing view of Singapore. I would really recommend you to go in the evenings when the sun goes down or at night. Singapore at night is an amazing experience that is even better when in the flyer.The Gondolas are really big so there is plenty of room to walk around or just take a seat and enjoy the landscape. Of course it is not cheap but it really is worth the money.,,,
,,Great view,4,,Fun and nice slow ride. Would feel better if it were cheaper. Pricey but an excellent view. We did it at night time. Like I said great view but be prepared to pay.,,,
,,Nice view,4,,"Quite enjoyed the ride (which takes about 30 minutes) and the views, both of the Singapore city and the Marina by the Bay.",,,
,,WHAT A VIEW,5,,We were all alone in one of the cubicle and it was magnificent to stay on top of the world..suspended with magnificent view. Must do in singapore,,,
,,A must do in Singapore,4,,I think this is a must do attraction followed by yummy gelati from Gelatissimo when you get off! The walking and stops along the way followed by the photo are great as it appears that it doesn't take long to wait in line!,,,
,,Great views,5,,"Interesting ride, and good views, about what you'd expect from a ride like this. It's on the pricey side, and feels a bit shorter than optimal.",,,
,,Great View of Singapore,4,,The 30 minute ride is worthwhile spending the money on. It is certainly a must for a Singapore visit as the views are just amazing.,,,
,,Nice views,3,,"Quite ok, but I had expected it to feel taller. There is no map or pictures inside the cars to inform you of what you are seeing. Maybe it feels better at night with all the city lights on.",,,
,,Must see!,5,,I would suggest to everyone to go on the Singapore flyer. The views are really beautiful! There is a lot of other activities to do in the Centre as well. We went for the 'Fish Therapy' and it was a VERY differnt and funny experience. You put your feet in a bath with lots of small fishes and they just eat away all the dead skins. Very differnt. Ther is also a flight simulator and 3d experience. Worh a visit.,,,
,,Observation Wheel,4,,"we went at dusk and so it was light when we started and dark when we finished, not too many people per cabin which was great, there had been storms that day so it had been closed but must've reopened quickly. We really enjoyed it.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer - Experiences I'll Never Forget,5,,"It was indeed a great experience to watch & enjoy Singapore Flyer. This is the world's largest man made observation wheel. The experience was awesome and thrilling. Towering 165 metres above the land. It's a waterfront attraction like no other. My recommendation is to enjoy at day & night both. At night time it looks simply great and from Flyer Marina Bay Sands Hotel and surrounding area just looks like a heaven on earth. It is a moving cetrestage of experiences you'll never forget. It's a must watch attraction in Singapore and if once enjoyed you'll never forget the experiences in your entire life for sure. Cheers,,,,,",,,
,,Definite must do in Singapore!,5,,"We loved the flyer! great view from the top! great views of the Singapore skyline especially Marina bay sands and the gardens by the bay. There were no queues , cabins seem very roomy althought that didn't matter as we shared with only one other person. Good food from the hawker food street . Definite must do in Singapore!",,,
,,Fantastic view of the city,5,,"Being scared of heights I was a bit unsure of going up in the flyer. Well worth it though and I wasnt concerned about how high I was as the flyer travels so slowly you just don't get nervous. There are amazing 360 degree views of Singapore, some great photo opportunities. I really enjoyed it.",,,
,,Timing is everything,5,,"It's a wheel so you get the idea. But it's a big one...., also it's on the edge of the marina so the vista is stunning. My advice is get the timing right and go at disk. 7 ish sees sgp at daylight and by 715 it's dark so you see the light..... Is a fantastic city view and great for visitors to get the bearings.",,,
,,Wow!,3,,"A view from the top. You can see the whole city by riding the singapore flyer. Kids and infants are welcome, its just that strollers have to be left and can be claimed from the gift shop.
If you see it from distant area, you might be afraid riding this, but please dont be, this is such a nice attraction worth to see",,,
,,Good But Gets Boaring after sometime,4,,"It should have run 4 rounds in 30 minutes rather than one round in 30 minutes , just its an obsorvatory",,,
,,Interesting view of Singapore,4,,Although we visited on a weekend it was not busy and with clear skies the views were fantastic. An enjoyable and different view of Singapore.,,,
,,Great views of Singapore.,3,,"A great experience ,takes about 30 minutes and a wonderful attraction for Singapore..
You get a 360 degree of the surrounds and at times you dont think you are moving.
The night trip would be wonderful however we didnt have time to do this .
Recommended for visitors to this wonderful city.",,,
,,"Singapore ""short list"" of things to do",5,,"We took this ride during the early day on a Friday, and had no wait, and about 8 of us in the cab, with plenty of room....do not worry where you are sitting, because you will get the chance to get up and look around from every angle.....the ride lasts 30 min, and the views are amazing.....the fee was $33 at the park, and I am not aware of any discounts...as mentioned, the cabs are very big, and are completely safe, and move very steady throughout the ride. ( pictures are easy to take, although there can be some reflection during the day).......one word of note, go to the restroom before getting in line, the line que can move quickly....",,,
,,cool experience,4,,"it was a cool and relaxing experience, very good view of marina bay and city in the night. the lighting effect is excellent. the ticket is a little bit expensive given it is only 30 minutes ride.",,,
,,Wonderful Experience,5,,"We took a ride in Singapore Flyer during last week of October 2012. We visited in the evening after heavy downpour and hence crowd was not much. Waited for just few minutes to take a ride. It was wonderful experience and as we gained height, the lights came on and we could see best of both day as well as night views. Surely, one can get better view from top of Marina Bay Sands hotel deck, but this was 360 degree view at slow pace and the experience was worth every moment. Only downside is, if there are children around, at times it becomes noisy.

Visit the flyer during evening!",,,
,,Outstanding!,5,,The view and facilities are outstanding. We didn't know you could book and have a dining experience in one of the cars. That would have been fun! Its a must when visiting Singapore,,,
,,A unique experience,4,,Experience the world largest wheel while getting a great panoramic city view. The capsules are big and safe. One round takes around 30minutes.,,,
,,Amazing view,5,,Rode the Singapore flyer at night and the view from it was amazing. What a beautiful area and city. It give you plenty of time for photos. We had seen a wedding party in one of the cars!,,,
,,Very good value,5,,"Did this during the day to avoid the crowd at night. Although it must have been more amazing to see the views and lights at night. 3 of us plus another girl inside which was really good.

Very good value, paid SG$33 per head for 30min ride is worth it.

A ""must"" for a first time traveller to Singapore.",,,
,,Worth the wait,4,,"There are some long queues for the flyer, common to many flyers around the world but it was worth the wait. The relaxing ride and the great views, better early and late, are good.",,,
,,better view at night,4,,"takes viewing to a different level especially at night. but only worth one ride. if you're visiting Singapore, it's worth the visit.",,,
,,Great at night,5,,If you fly Singapore AIrlines keep your boarding pass to show and receive a discount. The lights at night were beautiful and if you time it right there is a laser show over the marina.,,,
,,new experiance,5,,"i like it very much - as each cabin has its own A/C , and sound system - you can see Singapore from the top.also very clean.",,,
,,Spectacular views but go at night,5,,Superb views - go at night as city takes on a different hue - really vibrant. A definite must if you are in Singapore.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,enjoyed getting to see Singapore from this location. We went during the day but I'm sure the sight after dark would be great too.,,,
,,Good views,4,,"Goof views but careful with the rest of the people in the capsule because they will stand in front of you takimg pictures, without even looking if they bother you. It is better to change of places weveral times around the capsule along the ride to get the best pictures. You can leave your bags in the seats in the middle of the capsule during the ride.
It is a lovely ride and if there is any qeue it is fast so you dont have to wait a long time to get inside a capsule.",,,
,,360 degrees view,5,,"The largest observation wheel in the world! With the height of 3 giraffes tall, & a fee of SG$33 (adult) one gets an amazing view of Singapore - be at eye level with Marina Bay Sands Hotel, see the Esplanade, Merlion Park, The Fullerton Hotel, among others. You'll hardly notice you're moving at all - one full turn takes approx. 30 minutes & you also get to experience the City of Dreams - how the flyer came to be, be amazed with the play of lights inside, and the other shops as well after your ride, there's also a photobooth where you can get your souvenir shots inside the flyer and the good tastes of Singapore thru the foodtrail located on the ground floor, food is good as well & reasonably priced...",,,
,,Good Trip,5,,"Excellent experience, weather was A1 so saw all that there was to see. Clean & tidy staff helpful. Thanks",,,
,,Romantic and Bad for Height phobic,4,,"People who's afraid of height is not recommended to ride this flyer. The capsule was covered by glass so you can see below and it's so clear.
I was a little afraid of height and the scenery from that height bothered me a little.
It was romantic though. I went there for my 6th anniversary with boyfriend.
Before we went to the flyer, there's a small museum about the flyer itself. very interesting.",,,
,,Good views of the marina,4,,"You barely know you are moving, and get very good views of the marina area. We looked down on it from the Marina Bay Sands on an evening which looked beautiful lit up. It was quite quiet when we were there, and we got to look down on the Singapore Grand Prix area which was being cleared away after the race. Quite good value for money and the hop on hop off buses stop outside.",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"We went on this just before the Grand Prix weekend. I paid for our tickets online on the Singapore flyer website and got 10% off, which was very trouble free, I just handed the printed off tickets at the admission booth. You get a cheesy picture taken before you get on the flyer which is pretty funny and you can have a choice of backgrounds if you choose to purchase this at the end. There was no queue and we got staight on. The flyer itself is amazing runs really smoothly and lasts for 30 minutes or there abouts, amazing views over the whole of Singapore and the surrounding area and we got great views of the pit lane and the F1 being set up. Well worth the money and a fantastic experience.
The hawker area at the bottom of the flyer has great food all local dishes at cheap prices, and i highly recommend the icecream parlour outside which sells the most amazing icecream, I think i tried about 6 different types before making up my mind.
We also went to the Spa at the flyer and had our feet nibbled by fish which was a very enjoyable experience.
Overall loved this area of Singapore.",,,
,,Very nice Experience,4,,"Rode the flyer when we visited SG, truly a wonderful experience to rise above the SG Skyline, you can see a birds eye view of this little great city. The architectures of the buildings around are very unique. The staff and the general operations are very efficient and the little museum before boarding the flyer is very interesting too.
The only thing is the price for the flyer is on the expensive side, it would be better if they cut a little few more dollars off the price, my review for this attraction will be a perfect 5.",,,
,,awsome sight seen at the flyer,4,,it was a thrilling experience even to get into the slow moving capsule.it took about 40 mints to go 360 degrees in the most fascinating views i ever seen.the guide told you can see Australia on a clear sky day but we were not fortunate to see.,,,
,,Awesome experience,5,,"This was really part of my bucket list on places to visit in Singapore. Unfortunately, I was not able to book it with my package. But I insisted though that I had to experience the flyer. NO regrets! It was really worth the wait and the trip, despite the drizzling rain. There are many other things to do there aside from taking on the flyer.",,,
,,Great view on a good day,5,,I was lucky and had a great sunny day for the Singapore Flyer. It takes about 30 minutes and the views are spectacular.,,,
,,Over hyped,3,,"I don't quite like the flyer because the ride is about 30 minutes, and seriously there is nothing much to see from up there. the view all round is the same. although the cabin can fit many people, bear in mind, you'll be stuck with some unpleasant visitors for as long as the ride lasts. It happened to me. --- and it's a pricey ride like $30 and that's like $1 for a minute.",,,
,,it's our turn to enjoy the sky,5,,We were just on transit at Singapore for a day but we could not help to pass our chance to ride in the world renowned Singapore Flyer and even my friend who has fear of heights enjoyed every minute of it. Highly recommended.,,,
,,Awesome,5,,Takes 30 minutes to go around. Amazing views! Even for someone who has a fear of heights I just sat in the middle.. felt very safe,,,
,,If your in Singapore you must go on the Flyer,4,,The flyer is so quiet you don't even realize you are moving. Great for photo's and reasonably priced. Airconditioned and very comfortable.,,,
,,For the best views of Singapore. A little expensive though.,4,,"If you want the best views of Singapore a trip up the worlds biggest Ferris wheel is a must. The museum that you walk through to the Flyer is pretty cool too. However there a couple of downsides, there are a lot of people in one cubicle and it a little bit on the expensive side. However it is a great experience.",,,
,,overlooking singapore,5,,"excellent by dawn,you see aerial view of singapore city,with the beautiful sunset and the lighting of cityscape.but am i not shortchange for paying more for just one turn.nice thing is you can eat while viewing the cityscape.",,,
,,Great View,5,,"We had booked our tickets online, solve the waiting time.
Everything was efficient and fast from the moment you arrived to the time you out of the wheel.
You get a fantastic panoramic view of Singapore city and you can even see over to Indonesia!
Choose the time between evening and night fall, you will catch day & night if the sky fall dark fast. You will be able to see the Laser show if you book at the correct timing, think MBS Wonder Full is shown nightly, Duration is 15 minutes.
Sunday-Thursday:
8pm, 9:30pm
Friday, Saturday:
8pm, 9:30pm, 11pm

So plan well before you go up the Flyer : )
The views are absolutely breathtaking, can take lot of amazing photos.",,,
,,Great view,5,,New heights in Big Wheels great view of harbour and the many new and exciting structures around Singapore,,,
,,Good perspective of the city,4,,For the money it is good value. The cabins are spacious - they don't crowd you and you have plenty of room to move around to see what you want. Good views all around,,,
,,Great views!,4,,"We visited at around 4.30pm and this seemed to be a quiet time to go as we had a capsule to ourselves. The views were quite good but as we were here at the end of the monsoon season, they weren't as clear as you would get normally. Overall a worthwhile experience.",,,
,,Good place to take pictures,5,,Best viewed at night as you get a spectacular view of singapore in all its glory. Also take a walk down the F1 track before the ride as thats next to the flyer.,,,
,,a head for heights,5,,"a must, both in daylight for the fantastic views and in evenings too for the fantastic lights around the harbour",,,
,,Wonderful,5,,"I prefer this to the London eye, the commentary is interesting and the whole experience has a flavour that is quite unique",,,
,,Spectacular at night,5,,"They claim that this is 5m taller than the London Eye but I think that is only because it is on top a 2-3 storey building rather than the Eye being at river level. To my mind, the Eye is a larger wheel. Waving the flag for England!
Whatever, it is a spectacular ride - we did it at night and it was well worth it.
You can buy packages of tickets for various attractions and get discounts - we booked the amphibious Duck tour with the Flyer and saved money.
If you qualify for Senior discounts, make sure you know the individual costs before buying packages - it may well worth booking individually and getting the Senior discount (not available on packages)",,,
,,Great views from the Flyer!,4,,"The giant Singapore ferris wheel, the Singapore Flyer, is like most others around the world.
If there is one in the city, then there should be something to see from such a height (165 meters) the flyer reaches during it's slow rotation, on a clear day you can see for miles, but did not know where to look for Malaysia and Indonesia as the advertising states in their brochures!
Singapore is a small city by most standards, the population of five million in such a small space is a bit mesmerising, but here is the flyer, kindly referred to as the 'world's largest observation wheel'!
Easy access to this tourist attraction from any part of the city, and tickets are Adults $33, Child $21, Senior - 60+ $24 and family pack - two adults and one child - $78. Opening hours are from 9am to 10pm daily.
Getting onto the flyer is a somewhat lengthy procedure up the escalator to the next level and follow the level around past the flyer where you enter into a tunnel type hallway, bags scanned, continue through a non informative hallway until you reach the ramp that you line up on until escorted by staff into your capsule, all the time rotating. The flyer doe's not stop to let you get on or off. There is commentary in the capsule and air conditioned, but windows are not clean making it difficult to get good clear photos, unless you used a tissue or something to clean it!
The views are great if you like city views, and get to see and point out some known buildings like the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the science museum and Formula One circuit and the bus Singapore harbour working 300 ships a day!
You will even see aircraft landing and departing from Changi airport.
The rotation is slow and smooth and takes about 40 minutes, some passengers in our capsule were nodding off it was that interesting! But overall it is good and there are only so many ways you can look at a city from a ferris wheel!
If it is not raining or too cloudy you will see for miles and enjoy the stunning views.
You make your way out through the gift/souvenir shop back down to ground level after the ride.
Not high on 'things to do' list, more..will do if nothing else to do list.
Otherwise an okay attraction, but the Rainforest Garden was closed due to halloween functions.
Other attractions at the Singapore Flyer are;
the flight simulator, fish therapy spa,Duck and Hippo tours, shopping and the XD theatre.
Food and drink shops include Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,Ya Kun Kaya Toast, Gelatissimo and O'Learys Sports Bar & Grill, Subway and 7/Eleven.
The Flyer is also the base for sightseeing buses and tours starting at $19.90 per adult.
Taxis back into central city (Bugis Junction) pass the Raffles Hotel and fare is about $8.",,,
,,Not a fan of heights ...,3,,Took the Flyer at the request of our daughter. Certainly provides fantastic views of Singapore you could not get any other way. Pretty pricey for a 1/2 hr 'flight'.,,,
,,Exceptional Views,4,,Take plenty of time to allow for entrance requirements. Trip is slow enough to see everything you want to. Clear views from the capsules. Good helpful staff. Waiting for photos after the trip is a bit of a chore. Other facilities there good such as food places. Interesting fish in the garden below.,,,
,,Slow ride,3,,"The experience of getting to the flyer is just like going through customs, so allow time in peak periods for queuing. The 'flight' takes about 35 minutes, and you get great views of Singapore, but after about 20 minutes, I really wanted it to speed up.

Glad I ventured up there though.",,,
,,"a slow and interesting ""flight"" above the city",4,,the 28 passenger capsules offer clear views of the landscape and skyscrapers. The pace is slow enough to obtain full enjoyment of everyone's company. The price is fair for what you get. This observation wheel is the highest in the world right now.,,,
,,World largest observation wheel : wonderful experience,5,,"During our visit to Singapore, we enjoyed the World's largest observation wheel. Its about 165 mt high on the ground. Its has number of capsules. It capsule can accomodate 6-8 persons. It has a sound sysytem installed in each capsule through which you could listen the details. The veiw of entire Singapore and panoramic view of marine bay is really breath taking.
Tourist to Singapore should make a point to experience once.",,,
,,Average,3,,"It was kinda boring, very slow but is really worth a nice photo shot of the Marina Bay. We went at night which was a brilliant time to go, Singapore was lit up beneath us and it was magical.",,,
,,Good view,3,,"Good experience but the view from the Marina Bay Skypark is way better. And way cheaper. At $33, the Flyer is pretty pricey.",,,
,,If you have only a day - experience this,4,,"Singapore was a major disappointment as a tourist destination, lacking in any kind of unique atmosphere. However, this attraction is unique and at 165m high it gives you a fabulous perspective of what Singapore's strenghs are. Each pod holds about 20 people but we were there at around 10 am and found it lovely and quiet with no qeues ans only had to share with 5 others. This meant fantastic, uninterrupted views of what is a massive city. Particularly impressive are the fleets of container ships lined up right to the horizon making their way to what is reputedly the busiest port in the world. Also the skyscrapers of the financial district demonstrate what a powerhouse the place still is, and when you are at the top of the flyer you are almost level with the tops of the skyscrapers.
Professionally presented and run, if you can only do one thing as a tourist in Singapore, do this!",,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"Even though I was a little frightened by the fact that my one year old kept running at the glass and bouncing off the windows, this was a great experience. Fantastic views and ample time to take a million photographs.",,,
,,Good way to get an overview of the city...,4,,Nice view of the city in all directions. Great place to take pictures with different views as the backdrop.,,,
,,"Rather expensive, fairly good views",3,,"The Singapore Flyer was (possibly) inspired by the success of the London Eye - I've had Singaporean acquaintances refer to it as the 'Singapore London Eye' which suggests a rather confusing view of the world. It's bigger than the London Eye though, being built to fulfil that Brobdingnagian ideal of bigger always being better.

I'm not a great fan of Singapore's skyline; the Sands looks like it's trying too hard, the skyscrapers in the CBD seem like they're crammed too close together, and Singapore is flat as flat can be, so it lacks some of the glamour of New York or the majesty of Hong Kong's mountain towering above the buildings. However, from the vantage point of the Flyer, Singapore actually looks very pretty. Maybe I've got a chip on my shoulder and can only enjoy Singapore when I'm looking down on it, but from above the freeways that seem to awkwardly grope through the sky look like parts of a rather pretty toyset.

However, it is rather expensive, and the glass of the cabins is rather scratched and smudged. That means if you wanted to take photographs of Singapore by night, you may not have very good results (and that's before everyone else in the cabin tries taking a photo of a landscape at night and uses their flash...). If you want to look down on Singapore, you don't need to pay - just sneak up to the top of Marina Bay Sands and look down from there (with the added advantage over the Flyer that you can't see the Marina Bay Sands when you're standing on top of it.)",,,
,,Exceptional view of Singapore,4,,"It is expensive to go on the Flyer but it is a half hour ride and the view over Singapore is spectacular. I went up at night and the city looks especially good when all the tall buildings are lit up; you can even see the planes taking off from Changi Airport. The only negative (and it is minor) there are flashing neon lights on the side of the capsules which can interfer with picture taking when trying to capture the views on camera. On the whole, just as good as the London Eye and apparently taller!",,,
,,Beautiful view at night,5,,Singapore looks amazing from the Singapore Flyer at night. Definitely something you need to do when you are visiting Singapore.,,,
,,Fantastic views over the harbour and city,5,,"We really enjoyed our trip on the Singapore flyer, a very organised and interesting attraction, of course they take photos that you can buy at the end, there are places to eat at the entrance and a few other attractions too.

Easy walk from the hotel and also you can take the bridge over the water inlet,there are some very interesting buildings even one that looks like it has a war ship on the top of it.

Definitely worth a stay when in singapore",,,
,,Quite an experience!,5,,"Tickets cost s$33 per but if you can show your Singapore Airlines boarding pass or ticket, you get 20% off. If you are with someone in a wheelchair, you get in free.

Before leaving the Philippines I had emailed to ask about wheelchair accessibility and was assured of it. True enough one gets special attention, a special usher up to the door of the flyer and out of it.

The view is fantastic, the lights make it so. One catches a glimpse of the gardens by the bay, the F1 race track, the helix bridge.

The entire experience lasts 30 minutes, a relaxed rather than a frenetic half hour.

The flyer is accessible from marina bay sands by crossing the bridge on foot. The grounds of the flyer has restos and street hawkers food. We could have hadith taste of this here rather than in Ion orchard.",,,
,,Awesome view of Singapore,4,,"The ride is a half an hour ride, you can enjoy the view of whole Singapore in a unique perspective. I recommend you to go around 4.30 to 5pm because you can view it in daylight, not so warm. I will not recommend to go at night because all you can see is light.",,,
,,"great views, but very expensive",3,,"We visited the Flyer during day time. It gave the great view of S'pore, however the ticket price was just too expensive. Besides, the glass around the enclosure might need to clean it, cos' the dirt will impact the photo shooting. I believe the night scene might be more interesting and spectacular.",,,
,,Disappointing weather,3,,"On a clear day it would be sensational, but when we went it was very hazy and couldn't see clearly or for any distance. Tourist trap hassle (photos etc) was offputting. That would stop me going again.",,,
,,Amazing view!,4,,"Best view of the best city! Good to visit with family! At evening time or sunset should be even more beautiful. We've been day time, but enjoyed a lot!!!",,,
,,"Great views, well run but can be crowded",4,,"The flyer is a great way to get spectacular views over Singapore. It is a bit crowded at times but if you go in the morning before the tourist rush, you won't have to wait. Be warned the pods are largely glass so if you suffer from fear of heights it will be uncomfortable. The main downside was the difficulty in getting a taxi back to the city after our visit.",,,
,,Great views as far as Indonesia!,5,,"Buy the 48 hour Hop On, Hop off bus rhat includes the Flyer, Ducky boat / land tour, river cruise, museums, Botonical and Orchid Garden andbus to Sentosa. Great bargain!",,,
,,Superb Views,5,,Thirty minutes round-trip with excellent views of the bay and the country on a clear day. Try to go when it is not very crowded so you can move around the enclosure.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"Great place, no crowd, no rush.. Daytime view of entire city & night time lighted view is entirely different. i recommend take 2 flights 1@day & another @night- worth it!!",,,
,,Quite fun,4,,"We went at night which was a brilliant time to go, Singapore was lit up beneath us and it was magical. Make sure it isn't foggy when you go, that could ruin the experience.",,,
,,Top of the Wheels - for now,4,,"At the time we visited, this was the largest viewing wheel in the world, but apparently one is currently under way in the USA which will be bigger.

Viewing at night is probably the best way to go, as during the day the smog seems to reduce the viewing distance. Definitely worth the visit, although once is enough. A 30 minute ride will cost you $33 although package deals for families make it a little easier on the pocket. Put it on your ""to do"" list, cross it off and then move onto many of the other beautiful attractions that Singapore has to offer.",,,
,,Very good attraction!,4,,This is a must when you are visiting Singapore. Very good designed and good construction. The wheel is moving very slowly and you can see all over the city and Marina Bay. Good in the neight and during the day.,,,
,,Worth a ride,4,,"Perhaps a poor relation to the London Eye, because Singapores skyline is yet to mature fully, but the flyer is a fun exerience and affords great views of the ever changing City. Worth a ride!",,,
,,A bit over-rated,3,,"This was nice but I wouldn't do it again. I don't think it was worth the money paid. You get a good view of Singapore, that's about it. The kids were more interested in running around than looking at the view (naturally - what was I thinking when I planned it???) and we were put in a condola with another couple so I felt like I had to keep them calm and quiet the whole time. *sigh* I don't undertand why they did that when it was such a quiet day. It really takes the shine off the experience - for us AND I'm sure for the poor couple thrown in with a family of 5!

Don't do this with young kids.",,,
,,amazing view,4,,"I visited Singapore during the F1 Singapore GP and it was free to the zone 1 ticket holders. You can use it for any times you want. So we used it for three times. The ticket price is 33SD for one turn in the normal days. BTW, it is not open for the visitors who have no Singapore GP tickets during the 3 racing days.
When you calculated well you can see the racing start on the Singapore Flyer. It was the most excited moment of the racing. Of course you can see the beautiful view of whole marina bay circuit and Singapore.
I saw the different views at both day and night. But if you just have one time to visit it (for the price is not cheap), I advise you to visit it at night or at the sunset. The total time for one turn is about 20 minutes.",,,
,,Make sure you know the package you want,4,,"We went to the Singapore flyer as true tourists as we wanted to do the ""afternoon tea"", to find out that you had to ""book online"" to be able to do the trip. We then asked if it was possible to make a booking here now and get on, but they advised that we were only able to book for tomorrow. We used their computer which did not work, so we could not make the booking to get the 10% off, but they said they would assist us. We went for lunch and came back to find out that we did not qualify for the 10% discount for booking online as we were ""too late for tomorrows booking"". On top of that we found out that the price we had, did not include the famous taxes and service charges.

We then asked about a normal trip on the Singapore flyer to find out that we would in effect be paying just over 100 Singapore Dollars to have one tea and some biscuits for 4 people. Probably the most expensive tea we would have had to pay for.

We then opted for just the Singapore flyer and I have to say that the customer help desk was very kind to offer us a discount on our tickets because of the complications and misunderstandings that had occured.

The attraction is a 5 star attraction as a ""thing to do"" in Singapore to get an overview of the city, the only reason they ""lost a star"" was because we feel the afternoon tea is a bit of a rip off.",,,
,,Take a ride,5,,"This is the biggest wheel you can ride and is excellent. We did a night ride and the light show from the Marina can be seen from here. It lasts 30 minutes and if you use a Singapore airlines boarding pass stub it's 20% discount, worth it.",,,
,,Get there at 645pm,4,,I think it's around this hour to get the view of the sunset and you could actually get a wonderful and magical view over Singapore skyline which is absolutely amazing.,,,
,,No queues,3,,"We enjoyed the Flyer but as we had just done the Deck on top of the Marina Bay Skypark this may have taken the edge off the Flyer trip. In fact, if we had not already booked tickets online for the Flyer, I may not have bothered with the trip. Quite interesting exhibit at the base of the Flyer with all the technical data etc. If you are choosing between the Flyer and the Skypark, do the Skypark.",,,
,,Awesome,5,,We wnet at night. It's awesome. we got so many great pictures. You get a great view of the whole city. Its really worth a visit if your in singapore. We were lucky not to have to queue when we arrived. we purchased our tickets and went straight on. The photo was great. It turned out really well they even cropped it for us when we asked. I highly recommend it.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Went early morning no lines shared capsule with some Peruvians (2).

I'm a F1 fan, Icould see remnants of the track lighting and other infrastructure on pit lane.

Great views of Gardens by the Bay where I was yesterday and Marina Bay on tomorrows itinerary.

Easy walk from Promenade MRT or Bayfront MRT walking through Marina Shopping centre and over ""Double Helix"" bridge.
Still worth a visit.",,,
,,Bird's eye view,4,,Really enjoyed the SF. We went on it on our first full day in Singapore and really liked getting the overall view of the city. Expensive but worth it.,,,
,,Flying high!,5,,Great value for money. We were lucky to not have to queue and loved the photo you guys took for us. Amazing views over Singapore and the F1 track. Really worthwhile!,,,
,,It is one of those either you love or hate,2,,"To be honest I went on the flyer after highly recommended by some family and friends and found it utterly boring and time wasting. Leave alone $$$'s for ticket.

The flyer does not offer much. If you really want to see the views of Singapore, I would recommend to visit the Sky Park at night on top of Marina Bay Sands.... its worth it :)",,,
,,Unbelivable view,4,,One of the places to visit to take pics of/see Singapore from a bird鈥檚 eye. 1 hour is good enough for this place.,,,
,,World's largest ferris wheel..offering views of the pretty Marina Bay area in Singapore.,4,,"Great view, takes 30mins to complete 1 rotation though, huge capsules that can easily take more than 20 pax each. Other attractions and food joints at the Singapore Flyer area.",,,
,,Worthy attraction,5,,"One of the world's ""big things"" and perhaps not everybody's cup-of-tea, but we found this an enjoyable experience presenting another view of this engaging city",,,
,,Singapore flyer - excellent,5,,"Excellent views from the flyer of Singapore harbour, Gardens by the bay and the city.......airconditioned and great to take time to relax and see the city. Excellent other amenities, restaurants, toilets etc.",,,
,,A biiiiiiiiiig ferris wheel...,3,,"ok, it's big and the views are great. but it's slooooooow... if you are into Ferris wheels don't miss it. If not you can get better views from other places in the city!! A.",,,
,,Well Organized,5,,"Must do it, if not done in london, if you done in london, do this one for the expereince sake...panoramic view of singapore",,,
,,Great views even in the rain,4,,Just my luck as soon as we got on board it started to rain really heavy which then impacted on the views we had. It was still worth the visit as the rain only affected the views from one side. This is a much better was of seeing the skyline than the Marina sands hotel the buildin with the ship on top. You can buy a singapore tourist card that is very good value and gives cheaper tickets to the attractions of the city.,,,
,,Faster than it looks,5,,"We bought tickets for their Singapore Sling ride at 6:30PM. Very nicely done. There were 6 people in the capsule which allowed lots of room for everyone to look around. When you watch the capsules from the ground it looks like they are hardly moving, but our ride went much faster than we thought it would. Great view of the city and the Marina Bay Sands.",,,
,,truely magnificient and awesome,5,,"This Giant Wheel takes you to travel entire Singapore in bird's eye view.This is slow moving wheel which completes its one round in 30 minutes.The wheel has capsule like coaches to carry upto 10-15 persons in each capsule. The view of Singapore from this air-conditioned capsule is just great.
Make sure to have your camera ready to take photos.The fees per person is 33 Singapore dollar. It is little costly.",,,
,,Another tourist rip off in Singapore,3,,"This is probably a bucket list thing for many tourists to Singapore. Unfortunately, with their ever increasing prices, it will likely become unaffordable for most. We checked our hotel brochures, then discovered when we bought our flight tickets the prices had increased by more than 10%. The flights are generally in overcast skies, but the views are still good - Oct 2010 & Sept 2012.",,,
,,"Singapore Flyer - expensive, but great views",3,,"We checked the pamphlets at our hotel, then were disappointed to discover a more than 10% increase in prices when we bought our tickets. The views were good, even on a overcast day - both times I have flown on the Singapore Flyer. I wanted my husband to share the experience, but doubt we'll pay more than SGD$33 to do it again. Another example of the tourists being ripped off in Singapore again. It just keeps getting worse every visit. I was last in Singapore, Oct 2010, but by Sept 2012, the tourist rip off is getting so bad I doubt we'll stop off for days in Singapore again.",,,
,,SIngapore Flyer,3,,"The Singapore Flyer is touted as one of the highlights of a Singaporean experience, much like the London Eye.

It is indeed pretty when you are at the top and gazing upon the unparalled view, but other than that the ride is underwhelming and far too packed with other people. The cost is also not cheap.

Go only if you really want to/have a discount/get the tickets for free.",,,
,,...A must try for tourist,4,,"T'was on my list of ""MUST-TRY"", since I didn't get the chance to visit it the 1st time I was in the country. I must say, it was worth it!..It gave me the opportunity of viewing Singapore in a different perspective; & since my family & I went on a day time, it was less crowded...",,,
,,Singapore Flyer was super amazing,4,,Singapore Flyer is similar to London eye.....the view is truly amazing...this is the place to be especially in evening....,,,
,,Go there once 4 experience is good enough...,3,,Nothing exciting.. And if u are in the midst of some strangers for the next 30 mins... U will be in them for eternity!,,,
,,Singapore Flyer Flies,4,,We took the flyer as the sun set and hoped to see evening lights as well.It is taller than London Eye it took mere 25v minutes to do full circle.Evening photo shots can be a bit tricky as lights from outside reflect on glass.,,,
,,Great bird鈥檚 eye view,5,,"Climb onboard for a great bird鈥檚 eye view of the Singapore city skyline, marina bay precinct, port of Singapore and other landmarks. We arrived soon after 8.30am opening time, no queues and only three other people sharing the capsule. It鈥檚 the largest observation wheel in the world, standing 165m or 42 stories high 鈥?so we just had to do it.",,,
,,Great view but expensive,3,,"We went on a Sunday evening (8:30pm) before flying home the following day. View was great, the line up was short, the ""pod"" was not overcrowded and it was a nice experience.

The only thing that was not so great was the price. Basically US$200 for two adults and 3 kids. It is the biggest observation wheel in the world but I would rate this low for value. OK once only but not a MUST do in Singapore. Night Safari, Zoo etc. are much better value entertainment if your on a budget.",,,
,,singapore flyer,4,,one of d must to do - while in singapore.. can do it better at night with bubbly! if u are a couple... and for family.. its best at day time... as its less crowded.... good view... a service associate level while boarding-climbing the capsule should be more... as its on ur own policy!,,,
,,Touristy but must do.,4,,"Went at night and captured excellent views of the city. Day time was too overcast anyway. Good signage to get there from nearest MRT, but not so good the other direction! Can't be helped I guess but lot of fingerprints and smudges on glass so photos aren't going to be the best. Lots of reflections at night too some prepared to play around with your camera settings to are best night pics.",,,
,,Great photo opportunity,5,,Great way to see the city and get your bearings. We had been on the flyer when they were building the Marina Bay Sands so great to see that finished. This time we have a couple of free rides courtesy of the Grand Prix so enjoyed watching one of the F1 practice sessions from a different angle. We went back up at night and this was even more spectacular with all the lights.,,,
,,What fun!,5,,"We enjoyed our experience of the Singapore Flyer from go to whoa. IT is a definite must see. The view is outstanding. Even my husband who doesn't enjoy heights was impressed. Even the walk up is really interesting, showing how it was built in really exciting, interactive ways. My kids really found it good. The light show as you go up the escalator really sets the scene. When we went the line wasn't too long, so our wait was reasonable. The pods you go into are surprisingly large (my kids did laps of it!) with clear windows to see the view. The ride up and around is at a steady pace. You can certainly see a long way, anbd look at all the surrounding attractions easily.",,,
,,Skip-able Attraction,3,,"I am not too sure if this is the place that has the best senic view. Nonetheless, you will still get to see the whole area of Marina Bay, but 30mins on the Flyer (only 10mins on the top) is a bit too long for me.",,,
,,Overpriced and overhyped,3,,"A friend of mine works at Marina Bay and had taken me up to his office to see the view, which was breathtaking.

I was looking forward to my 'flight' on the Flyer but have to say it was an underwhelming experience. Lots of queuing, very expensive, the thing turned so slowly and I actually felt a little claustrophobic knowing it would be an hour or so in that capsule.

The views are nice, but far better from my friend's office.",,,
,,So glad we pre-booked a cocktail flight ....,5,,"I decided to pre-book a cocktail flight as part of our wedding anniversary celebrations. Our flight was booked for 18:30 and instructions were to arrive at least 30 minutes before the flight.

We arrived a few minutes before six that evening and were directed to the lounge, but there they said we were a bit too early and suggested we take a wlk around the complex. The rain forest area was closed for maintenance, so we walked outside and took some photos of part of the Formular 1 race track.

On our return, we were asked to take a seat and then we were issued with boxed souvenir glasses and an escort arrived to fast track us to the embarkation point, via a photo call stop. We were told we would be in the Moet & Chandon pod and were ushered forward at the appropriate time.

There was a butler in the pod, with our cocktails ready on a tray and once we were aboard, he got out and off we went. Pleasingly, there were just the two of us taking the cocktail flight at that time, so we had the pod to ourselves making the experience all the more special.

The timing of the flight meant that we started off in daylight, but dusk and darkness took over before the end of the flight, meaning that we also got photos of the city at night.

At the end of the flight one exits through the gift shop, where you can purchase your photo, with a choice of backgrounds.

We were very happy with our flight exerience and would not hesitate to recommend it to others.",,,
,,Full Butler Sky Dining,5,,"We went for the full butler $269 (拢135) per couple deal with a 4 course meal , but if you take the normal admission charge of $66 per couple per half hour and with the meal you get a 1 hour ride so it really cost $132 per couple (拢66 ) work that one out LOL , Although the meal was rushed the food was very good with Caesar Salad to start fresh and crispy then Cream of Wild Forest Mushroom Soup accompanied with freshly鈥恗ade breads which was a bit cold on the top but warm underneath to follow this I had Lamb Shank with Red Wine Mint Sauce, served with Mashed Potato and Seasonal Vegetables which was nice and hot and very tasty and my wife had the Grilled Seabass, served with Roasted Potatoes and Seasonal Greens,with Cream Fusion Truffle Sauce which she said was excellent with Homemade Chocolate Truffle, Fruits Compote for dessert all in all a good night out and something completlet different and well worth doing , after we got off we were free to roam up and down the start line of the F1 grid and pits .",,,
,,Worth visiting,4,,We went late evening and were able to get pictures with the sun just setting on the way up and pictures when dark on the way down - perfectly timed as best of both worlds but couldn't tell you what time that was exactly! Worth doing if you are around Marina Bay Sands. After you can then walk down and catch Wonder Full the show at 8pm (arrived just in time) which is free and worth a look.,,,
,,Gotta do the 'flyer',5,,"There are many vantage points throughout Singapore where you can get a great elevated view of the city, or parts thereof. As a family, my wife and two boys 8 and 10, we did may of them. The cable car to Sentosa, the Ku De Ta bar at the top of the Marina Bay Sands, Mount Faber, etc. All were good but none as good at the Flyer. Air conditioned comfort, perfectly smooth and silent with extensive roof line to floor glass giving great all round views. The capsules are huge and apart from us 4 we only has three others with us resulting in plenty of room to move around. 10 out of 10.

On another note we had the misfortune of giving in to the want of our boys and booked tickets on the 'Duck'. This operation is borderline shambolic and more in line with cheaper attractions in Thailand or Bali. Fine if you are expecting that level, but seems so out of place in Singapore. The engine at the back of the bus/duck is that loud we could not here the commentary whilst we did a quick lap of a couple of city blocks nor whilst we were on the water. As I had my suspicions this ride was more gimmick that substance, I set the bar fairly low. Sadly it did not even rise to that meagre level. 3 out of 10 only for this attraction.",,,
,,The Flight over Singapore,3,,The line to it is huge but in it you have an amazing view across Singapore and the Ocean all the way to Sumatra and the other way to Malaya. At night you can see all the lights on the city and is an amazing view.,,,
,,Good views,3,,"It would be better to go up at night when the views are quite remarkable. It would be nice if there is a 'package' deal to combine The Singapore Flyer, the Gardens by the Bay, etc.",,,
,,EPICNESS!!,5,,"Although it goes slowly, the view is incredible. If you are planning to go, I suggest you go at night, as you can see all the beautiful lights, too.",,,
,,Must go!,5,,"SG's Singapore flyer is a must go. Giving you a bird's eye view of Singapore. Plus, when you go there, shops and restaurants are all over so you can lounge before and after the flight. Very very nice experience.",,,
,,Good view,4,,"It was good to have a capsule to ourself. Go on a weekday would be best I think. The views were spectacular, got some good pics. The ride was faster than expected, about 30min. Something else to enjoy if nothing else.",,,
,,nice,4,,"Didnt think I would enjoy this, but I did, if its fairly quiet you get a pod to yourself, and the views you get as you rotate are good.Easy to get to and there is a nice ice cream shop just outside .mmmmmm",,,
,,Well organized not very spectacular,3,,"You can have dinner in one of the cabins, that is nice. the view from the top dissapointed a bit. You see far more from the roof of the Marina Bay Sands hotel.",,,
,,Fantastic views,4,,"Great views. Went on a week day so we had the whole carriage to ourselves. Interesting and informative intro to the flyer as you walk through the building to get to the carriage.
They take your photo and insert an image behind you which you can purchase after your trip.

Overall it was a good experience. I would probably look at purchasing a package ticket that includes other tours or attractions as they seem good value compared to the $33 you pay just for the flyer.",,,
,,On a High........Bird's eye View....,5,,"An exhilarating experience definitely worth cherishing for a lifetime. The view from the Singapore eye capsule on a clear day is unique especially the evening when the lights starts glowing on the popular landmarks in a particular way that the entire city seems to be glistening. The view from the top makes it the extremely busy city look like an interesting intermission between the past and the present where one can see a clear contrast of the tall buildings of Singapore being dotted by the river ,gardens & racing tracks. A structure that defines the new age Asia. We took the flight when the sun was just about to set hence finished it at the evening. The rotation never disturbs your views to everything in Singapore & gives you the feeling of a bird. Really worth its value while discovering Singapore.",,,
,,Okay..,3,,"We did the 30-minutes ride. The view is nice as you can see a other attractions around the Flyer area. There is also an information pamphlet in the capsule of the attractions around you. Maybe could help you plan where would you go next after the flight. However, it could not compare to other capsule ride that we've experienced before such as the Eye of London. Probably, due to the design of the capsule that restrict some view.",,,
,,singapore flyer dinner,3,,Wouldn't recommend doing the dinner on the flyer as its too rushed and the main course was cold! Also the price of alcohol was over the top - $28 plus 17% tax for a glass of bubbles! Also it was very impersonal - no greetings or explanations of anything.,,,
,,5 feet taller than the London Eye,4,,"We were on a tight time frame so aim to go early evening and the sun setting would be magnificent, the views are great and what views there are to see.
There are quite a few shops and places to eat, and on the ground floor a lot of open air eating, we tend to take our own teabags abroad, so had nice cups of Tetley, just hand them the bag.",,,
,,wonderfull,4,,"i've been here twice, and i think the view at night is a lot better than day time. also, try not to get on the ride with other people kids, it's really annoy when they jump around and shout with excite.",,,
,,Amazing view!,5,,"Great tourist attraction. I was on it during night and all the city looks stunning from it. The lights, Marina Bay and all the city districts are really beatiful.",,,
,,Night view of Singapore Marina Bay is superb!,5,,"A 30-minute-ride on the flyer will leave you ""speechless"" on the beauty of Singapore skyline no matter you are riding it at morning or night. You can see lots of iconic structures like Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by The Bay, the floating stage and Singapore F1 Marina Bay Street Circuit just under your feet. Not to mention it is the world's tallest observation wheel.
If you happen to attend Singapore F1 Grand Prix, it is a MUST to ride the Singapore Flyer. It is free for many types of tickets and most importantly, the queue is NOT LONG although it is free! You can feel the adrenaline in you as a result of watching F1 cars racing 165 metres under you.",,,
,,Scarey but ok...,5,,I am terrified of heights but couldn't miss this. There is a central bench in the pods and I sat on that from start to finish and still had a good view. Visibility was a bit poor this day as burning forests in Indonesia.,,,
,,Singapore flyer good experience,4,,"We did the flyer as we thought why not something different and it was, the slow moving wheel gave you the perfect chance to view Singapore from every point, the carriages were air conditioned which was wonderful on a hot day in September and yes the charge was a little high but we had accounted for that in our expenditure, views were brilliant, the only downside we faced was due to the Grand Prix the roads were still closed a few days later so it made it a little hard to get to the flyer, but a great experience",,,
,,Take a ride on the Flyer,5,,"We went on a Monday afternoon-- no lines and only eight of us in one capsule. All the information leading up to the loading platform was very informative. Reminded me of a Disney quay. The only disappointment was the haziness of the sky, which didn't have anything to do with Flyer. We loved the panoramic views of the city and the bay.",,,
,,Worth a visit if in Singapore,4,,"A good opportunity to get panoramic views around Singapore; I went on the night to see the city; take the MRT to Promenade. You get to see a lot of the main tourist attractions; marina sands and its bay, great views over the city, and the gardens by the bay. We tried to time it to see the laser show at the gardens; which we either saw and it wasn't very impressive, or it was something else we saw? It takes about 30 mins for a full cycle of the wheel.

The price to go up was $33, which I thought was ok; but only because there was a walk through information area about the wheel.

There are a few bars and places to get food nearby, along with a walk through souvenir shop.

It is certainly an attraction to visit, but I can't help but think the skywalk might have been the better option?",,,
,,CLEANLINESS,4,,We visited Singapore Flyer last year. It was a first experience for my 8 years old daughter. We love the view from the top and happy with the experience. It was worth the visit for all of us. We were happy with the cleanliness of the entire area especially the washroom/toilet. That's the most important for visitors with family and small kids. Great job keeping the public area clean!!,,,
,,"Nice ""flying"" but slow...",3,,"No queuing issues for us, but due to the dry season there was a lot of haze around and so the view wasn't that great. Night time might have been better (we did the Sentosa Cable Car at night and it's great, although the view/things to do from the top of Mt Faber leaves a bit to be desired). Probably better viewing from other tall buildings such as Marina Bay sands, and for the 11 of us a bit expensive as well. It's about 30 minutes for a cycle and the kids were bored within 15 or so. As others have mentioned it is accessible by MRT and although we managed to catch a bus that took us directly back to Vivo City for the monorail back to Sentosa, we were lucky we met a bunch of bus drivers who told us which bus to catch and where otherwise we might have been stuck.",,,
,,Singapore Sling,4,,"Purchased the extra singapore sling and booked a late night (9.30ish) trip on my honeymoon. Timing was perfect as we got a capsule to ourselves with drinks and all. Amazing trip with music and drink, would definitely recommend.",,,
,,The Living Daylights,3,,"My partner and I decided to celebrate our anniversary with a kiss on the very top at night, that was a knock out but less impressed with the flyer at night. There was no commentary or music so it lacked a little something. Might be better during the day.",,,
,,Not that great,3,,"The actual flyer is quite spectacular but I really didn;t enjoy the ride. It was very slow, I know that it is supposed to be, but I just felt like it wasn't that great. I would far rather recommend going ot the Skypark at the Marina Bay sands (it's also cheaper)",,,
,,brilliant sights,4,,Getting to the flyer isnt easy about 15 mins walk from MRT and it isnt sign posted!But when you get there its brilliant well worth it.All the information about the flyer is cool in an interesting way on your walk up.,,,
,,Fantastic views of Singapore,5,,"You can see so much from the Flyer. We saw the F1 circuit, the Marina Bay complex and much of Downtown Singapore. Reasonable value for money at 33 dollars.",,,
,,Queue is a nightmare!!!!,3,,"An hour and a half in queueing will dampen any enthusiasm of any eager tourists really!!! And cleanliness of toilets are not really SG standard, I've always expected SG to have really clean toilets for some reason. I guess I'm mistaken.",,,
,,Ferris wheel review,3,,"Gives a good view of all of Singapore, 1hr trip, long line ups to get on. Maybe from most hotel (high floors) you could see similar views.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"It's a nice view from the top, but the cabins are over crowded and the time is very little.The cost is also high compared to the time it takes to enjoy the view.",,,
,,A must do when you visit Singapore.,5,,My friend and I were not originally going to visit the Flyer but had some spare time and decided to go on it. I was SO pleased we did. It was a fabulous experience. Didn't take too long to get tickets and get onto it and the 30 minute ride gave us spectaculor views over Singapore - just a bit of a shame the smog etc prevented us seeing it on a clear day. Would highly recommend it.,,,
,,Fly Away,5,,Singapore Flyer is excellent value and not to be missed. Half hour ride great photo ops looks over the grand prix circuit.,,,
,,Up in the Air,5,,Amazing and delightful experience. I have a fear of heights and getting on the Singapore flyer got rid of it as well as the feeling of fear in an enclosed space. Watching Singapore from above was just majestic! I would love to go back and ride at night. Don't miss this when you visit Singapore.,,,
,,Fly high over Singapore,4,,"Great views, bit high priced and needs better signage as when we visited there was a very large group as we had trouble finding where we got on.",,,
,,unique ride,4,,its a unique experience getting on the singapore flyer... the flyer keeps moving around slowly and you need to just jump into your booth..its a good way to look at the entire city..they provide you with audio guides which are pretty useful in understanding the popular structures in the city..although the rides are a bit expensive.. and clearly people who are afraid if heights should avoid it..,,,
,,Great views,4,,Got to do this for free as we were there for the F1 Grand Prix and there were no crowds at all - so straight on and only 8 of us in total in the cabin. Views are amazing and it's very peaceful and quiet up there away from all the crowds and traffic. Nice and cool too - so a pleasant way to spend 30 minutes or so just looking around.,,,
,,Good,5,,An experience which is necessary once. Preferably in the evening as the Singapore skyline looks beautiful at Night. The total ride is for approx 35 mins but takes a lot more time as there is generally a waiting. The shopping also is nice,,,
,,Up up and away!,5,,"No queues, sparkling clean attraction (as are most in Singapore), fabulous views, walking distance from the Marina area. Great for kids, but also worthwhile for all ages.",,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,Fantastic views of the City. Only negative is the fact that it takes a while to rotate around and it is very busy.,,,
,,Must Do.,4,,"Great views, and a must do if your in Singapore. Try and beat the crowds and go before 5pm. Or go in the night time as that is sensational view.",,,
,,one to tick off,4,,"Glad we went on here but don't think it's something you need to do twice. We didn't have the best day for seeing things but still got a good view. I would have regretted not going on. Thought i would have been scared by height but it seems very safe when on there, went slowly for half hour. Thought price was reasonable. Would have been nice to have gone at night as looked like there were some nice food places below at level you pay at.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer....,3,,Nice view....especially nite view from the cabin.... Able to view to whole Singapore city...n Garden by the bay...,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"This is a nice place to get a bird's eye-view of the Marina Bay area which has many attractions such as the Merlion Park, Marina Bay Sand Casino, Garden by the Bay and many others. It is good to go on a day with clear sky so as to maximize your viewing pleasure. On most days, you should have no problem getting a fabulous view. There are headset and leaflet to guide you on what to look out for. If you go at an odd hour, you may even get the whole capsule for yourself. There are a wide variety of food outlets at the base of the Flyer for meals or drinks.",,,
,,Stunning,5,,This is an experience to remember. Photo opportunities at every corner. Singapore from the sky at night is a sight to be seen.,,,
,,Good views of the city,4,,Great attraction to get 360 degree views of the city. Found the voice over very infomartive and provided a good history of Singapore whilst enjoying the spectacular views. Great for the first time visitor to Singapore.,,,
,,brilliant,5,,"wonderful views over the bay and the city, moves slow so no feeling of movement, pricey but worth it",,,
,,Fabulous Views,4,,"We had free tickets for the Flyer as part of a Singapore Airlines Stopover, which saved us 33SGD. We had held our nerve and waited until our last full day to go on the Flyer, as the weather had been dull and hazy the rest of the week. What a good job we did. A storm and downpour the night before cleared the air and the views were terrific. We went very early (about 9.15am) and were rewarded not only by a clear atmosphere which allowed us to see Indonesia, but also a lack of any queue. By the time our 30 minute trip was over the queues were getting large.",,,
,,Great bird's eye view!,4,,"It's a must to try the Singapore Flyer. It will give you a bird's eye view of the entire city. I agree that sunset will be the best time to visit. It's amazing to see the city as it is and after a few minutes be turned into a kaleidoscope of lights. The staffs were helpful and the place is not overly crowded. If lucky enough, you may have the capsule on your own. After that, you may want to consider a walk around the Marina Bay and an ice cream sandwich from the around-the-corner ice cream vendor!",,,
,,flying high over singapore,5,,The view from the singapore flyer was amazing for taking photos. The ride was smooth and very enjoyable. The only dislike was that as each capsule can take around 26 people it can be over crowded and very noisy.,,,
,,Expensive View,3,,"I know most people love the Flyer and it is a unique experience that everyone should try at least once. I just wasn't that excited. Sure I was impressed by the structure and engineering it took to design and build it. I know it's not an amusement ride, but it just got pretty boring after only a few minutes into the long 30 minute ride. I found myself wishing I had spent my money on the Marina Bay Sands Skypark instead. If it's good views you seek, there are several buildings in town with great lookouts for less cost. Now I can say I've been on the worlds largest wheel and that's about the best thing I can say about the experience.",,,
,,Flyer,4,,Its ok just like the flyer in any other country. Best time is to go when it is sunset. You can see CBD area,,,
,,Great views,4,,"We had a free ride as we had F1 tickets and really enjoyed the half-hour trip round, with great views over a lot of the Marina Bay area.",,,
,,singapore flyer,5,,amazing as you go up great views up and down did this after fi great veiw of track a great complex where you start had trouble finding access to flyer but guess read the signs lol,,,
,,View from the top!,5,,"Love it. You can view all the amazing places at the top. They provide map inside the capsule for u to know what are the places u can see from there.
It's a good experience and I suggest to go there first so that u can plan where u want to go next.",,,
,,a very nice view,4,,"the view is nice and they have specials rides, like champagne, dinner etc. book online as the ticket is cheaper and no line to wait.",,,
,,See the best of Singapore,4,,"Much has already been written about the Singapore Flyer and yes, it is a bit pricey - but the view all the way up, and all the way down is worth it. Check-in was a little hard to find and the displays before you get onto the ride were a cheesy, but overall, it's a memorable experience.",,,
,,Pride of Singapore,5,,"Flyer is not a ferris wheel, it is an observation wheel. So don't go expecting a thrilling ride with fast motion. For that there are other attractions. If you go to flyer remember that it is a slow half an hour ride which takes you through the different view perspectives from bottom to top and then back again. Once you go without any false expectations, you won't be disappointed.

It is definitely a pride of Singapore, being the tallest observation wheel in the world, till date. Go on the ride, relax and spend the next half an hour or so enjoying the beauty of the city state. See how a modern country, with high rises and every possible amenity is also a green haven. Look at the beautiful Singapore river passing through the heart of the city. Both day and night offer a different experience. If you can't go at 2 times, best is to go around sunset so that you can see the view and take photos in both daylight and dark.

A perfect way to de-stress in our fast paced life.",,,
,,Get a helicopter view of the Grand prix,4,,Good value for quick whirl especially on a day just before the Grand Prix to see the track from the air. It is very busy on the GP days but would be a good trip on Friday practice,,,
,,Cool experience but rather expensive,3,,"We were expecting more of a Ferris wheel so the ""pods"" that hold many people and allow you to wander around catching pictures and different perspectives were quite a surprise. The overall experience was cool! We went just after sunset so had the chance to see the city lights which were spectacular. The pace while on the ride is much faster than you think when looking from the ground - not fast, but a steady pace. We went with a couple of pals so were able to chat and catch many pictures.

Downside: we shared our ""pod"" with another group of about 10-12 people that had 2 small children. One of the kids cried and screamed for most of the ride. In that small space, it was quite unpleasant and very much colored the experience. Also, the cost of the tickets was on the high side -- about $33USD. So when we ""landed"" I mentioned to one of the staff that we had a screaming kid in our car and asked if we could try it again without the drama (and at this point, many of the cars were going around empty) and was informed of course we could buy another ticket and go again -- ahhhh... that was not what I meant. We just left...",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Positives: moves very slowly so not rushed, plenty of time to see amazing views and take photos, very comfortable Negatives: expensive, gets a little bit boring near the end",,,
,,Great views,5,,Fantastic view of sings re and especially of marina bay sands and sky park not to scary to ride on. Plenty of room to move around and take photos,,,
,,Utterly disappointed and disgusted at how managers handle stuffs,1,,The managers there are dumb. They can't facilitate the crowd properly. And plain ignorant to the questions hurled at them. They should brush up on their English and give us a good explanation on the waiting time.,,,
,,Not worth the money!,3,,"Nothing new about the flyer.London Eye is better.The speed is ok bit it really does not hold any great attraction value for visitors.You can get a better view from the Marina Sands Skypark,which has more attractions and difference between is only 5SGD.
I think this is one of the disappointment of our trip to Singapore.
Advice -Avoidable!!",,,
,,Pretty good.,4,,"Really, if you go to Singapore, you want to ride the Flyer. However, we preferred the wheel in Osaka simply because the carriages were significantly smaller and you got a much clearer sensation of height (i.e. hell, that's a long way down!) because of that.",,,
,,World's Tallest Ferris Wheel,4,,"Visited Singapore in Aug 2012 and a ride on the world's tallest observation wheel was a must! I went at around noon and was desperately searching for an escape from the intense heat outside! I don't know why but getting there was a little confusing! I could see the wheel but sometimes I wasn't sure if I were walking in the right direction or not. haha.

Great view of Singapore - you see a lot of the key architectural highlights and attractions of the city from high above. My favourites - the Formula 1 track and all the 100s of ships in the harbour. Really impressive! Afterwards - there are a couple of restaurants to eat at, if you don't want to look elsewhere. Some of them offer free wi-fi (always helps with my selection of where to eat!!).

If I had to ride again I would go at night time because the Singapore skyline at night is incredible.",,,
,,Flyer by night,5,,"Great experience and well worth the money (ok so it came free with tickets to the Formula One race).
Great view of the city - we went at night and the views are spectacular.
If you go during the race week it gives you a great appreciation of the track.
Don't miss it.",,,
,,Best value if you are on a time crunch!,4,,"Spectacular view of the Beautiful city!! I've purchased the tickets to the Flyer + $40 coupon for Bar & Grill for $65 at the Airport (for 2). It is an awesome deal, as the ticket costs $33/person also the restaurant was conviniently located in the same building as the Flyer!! It was a steal!!

We were there the weekend of F1 in the city, so we got to the see the F1 track from the Flyer... Great view of the skyline, Marina Sands Bay.... etc!",,,
,,A bit expensive,4,,"It is cool and you get a wonderful view of the city but it is a little bit too expensive...
It takes around 30 min so make sure you have time. It is not crowded so no problem getting tickets and no problem taking cool pictures from the cabinets.",,,
,,singapore flyer,5,,words cant describe. fantastic not for the faint hearted but a great photographic moment. the way it is lit up at night is in itself a wonderful sight to see.,,,
,,What a great view!!!,5,,"Excellent attraction which highlights the magnificant sights of Singapore. Well worth visiting. You are able to dine in the evening, but this needs to be booked.",,,
,,"Big Giant Wheel, better than London Eye",4,,"You can see all of Singapore Country and beauty seeing in noon, but you can't see anything in night.",,,
,,great view of Singapore,5,,"during my last Singapore visa run from Bali last 14th September I finally took time to use the Flyer so I could overview the F1 race track setup at night .... SPECTACULAR VIEW ... saw already years ago the one in London but here in Singapore just some little more spectacular
just can recommend to everyone during their Singapore visit",,,
,,On top of the World,5,,"Well, must say you're way up there. The trip is really fun and takes about 30 minutes in an air conditioned capsule that moves very slow. I thought it wasn't running until someone told me it just moves very slowly. You an see for miles and miles is very spectacular.",,,
,,Great experience,5,,Not for those who have a fear of heights. A great slow ride with superb views. Relaxing and air conditioned . We had a carriage to ourselves(4 of us) and this may be due to it being a weekday around 10.30,,,
,,great view of singapore,4,,Must do list of attractions for Singapore. well worth the money Very quite and smooth ride thoroughly enjoyable,,,
,,Gotta do it,4,,"There are a number of places from which you can get a good view of the Singapore skyline and bay, but this is probably the best as you get very high up and can see in all directions. Go at 8 or 9pm so you can see the Marina Bay Sands light show.",,,
,,nice scenery up from flyer,4,,"got a chance to take the flyer when i went for the Singapore F1 this year. Nice view from the flyer, you can see the high rises at the central business district of Singapore. It is a different feeling to take Singapore Flyer if you compare with London Eye.

there are some stalls at the ground floor, where you can find singaore local food. Just to note that, the price is slightly higher there.",,,
,,Great!,4,,"Did this as part of the SIA holiday freebie, maybe in winter the air is clearer and you might be able to see more in the distance. As a freebie it was a great experience.",,,
,,Great Experience,5,,I have been to the London Eye and the Singapore Flyer and I have to say that the experience of the views and servie and everything with the Singapore one are awesome. Heavily recommended a must do when visiting Singapore. Well worth every cent for the magnificent views and the fun.,,,
,,Wow !!!,5,,Mind blowing and world class. A must visit in singapore. Don't forget the cameras. Amazing view of the city and the GP circuit. You can but some memorables after the ride. Don't miss this !!!,,,
,,Excellent veiw from above the city,5,,"Singapore Flyer offers the best way to view Singapore from the sky. Excellent location, easy access, great price. Close to many other attractions which all can be accessed just by walking around. Highly recommended.",,,
,,Awesome!!!!!,5,,The view is superb!!! its quite an experience I must say! It was my first trip abroad and i kinda loved the flyer!,,,
,,Free! Get a Zone 1 or 2 Formula 1 GP ticket,5,,Great views and well worth going during the GP but you need a Zone 1 or 2 ticket. Views of the circuit are superb and you can enjoy 30 minutes in the cool.,,,
,,Free trip with Grand Prix Tickets,5,,Fantastic place to see the GP circuit from - and it's free (after you've paid out heaps for your grand prix tickets) Best place to see the GP track and a great view across Singapore city. Don't miss this !,,,
,,Singapore,5,,"Wow, we have always been in transit on our way to Malaysia Neil this year,,,,, wow! It is a fantastic place.

The invalids Flyer is amazing, views all across the island, it was dusk and the sunset was 'A-mazing' !

Hotel Marina Mandarin was excellent so central for everything . Can recommend the hop on hop off busses too.",,,
,,Expensive but a good view,3,,"Went to the Singapore Flyer on a Sunday afternoon, not crowded at all so there was no wait. When you get to the Flyer you will go through a number of ground floor attractions, which are okay and will give you some history on the flyer.

The Flyer itself was nice, each cabin was air conditioned and very spacious so that was nice. The views are good but nothing special relative to a high floor in hotel or other building. I have a feeling that the night views from the flyer might be better but many of the tour group tickets (which we had) are not valid after 6:00p. Overall with the regular ticket price around ~$30 this was a pricey attraction.

Overall I found it to be a nice break from the hot weather, but I would not recommend anyone to go if they don't already have a ticket as part of a package, particularly during the day.",,,
,,Sky High,4,,"Expensive , but worth the effort with lots of interesting exhibits at ground level, and good food court",,,
,,"best view, great experience",4,,"highest wheel in the world , well , it's just 5m higer than the London eye ...
I went there in the early evening, I did not queue at all and there were only the 3 of us in a ""cabin"". the tour lasts for 30 minutes and with the 360掳 view, you don't know where to look ! the view is amazing and I really recommend it.
my hostel got me a small discount, so try to see with the reception desk if you can buy ticket from them.
and don't worry if you are affraid of highest, it doesn't move at all and you don't realise how high you are.",,,
,,Too expensive and slow,1,,We could see these views for the most part from hotels. It was a dissapointment. It went slow and there were too many people in our carraige.,,,
,,Great view from the high!,5,,"London Eye in England is wonderful but Singapore Flyer is much more wonderful. Each cabin is as big as a bus, its capacity is 28 passenger, even it has air condition. When i entered into the cabin, i felt very comfortable. My friend advised me come to Singapore Flyer in the sunrise and I did it. In the cabin, at the high of 165m and see the sunrise. That's my wonderful experience. Surely, I will come Singapore Flyer with my girlfriend in another sunrise.........................................",,,
,,Signature Cocktail Flight,5,,"My husband and I decided to do the cocktail flight as we were on holidays celebrating our 35th Wedding Anniversary, and it was an experience not to be missed.
Because of booking ahead and choosing this flight, we had a time that we were booked for, and we were taken from the book in room by elevator to the entrance to the ride, taken in a different lane to other people waiting for a regular flight, and shown to our capsule. We were the only 2 in our capsule, it was tastefully decorated with lush seating etc, and we were given a souvenier glass to keep.
The ride was so smooth, you could hardly tell we were moving, and as it was such a lovely day we could see forever. I have some great photos taken from up there, and the whole of Singapre is so green and clean with some architecture that has to be seem to be believed.
The obligatory tourist photo was taken and available for purchase at the end of the ride, and I must say I was so surprised at the low cost.
Recommend this attraction to everyone visiting Singapore",,,
,,Great views but a little expensive,4,,My title says it all. The city at night looks amazing. Even got to the start line for the F! Grand Prix but I thought it was a little expensive for what you got.,,,
,,great views and best right on sunset,4,,"plan your flight to coincide with the sun just as it starts to set. The colours can be amazing, and the Flyer lights up making for magical photos. Some excellent eateries at the base of the flyer too and the Hop on Hop off bus stops right there...couldn't be easier.",,,
,,An experience,4,,"Views are amazing at this place but that is to be expected. We were surprised by the overall experience though. Upon arrival there were no queues so we were able to go through very easily. It is likely to be more crowded in the late afternoon. There is history and lots of gadgets to play with before you get to the actual flyer. Depending on the number of people waiting will determine whether you are able to secure one of the pods on your own. We used the sharing experience to take photos for others and get them to return the favour. We went to the food court which is a quaint place with lots of variety (note it is outdoors so no air conditioned comfort) We ordered too much food as usual, but the satay was delicious. One of the best we have had in SG so far.",,,
,,Overview of Singapore,5,,"What a great way to get a look at singapore, it really helped see where most things of interest are.",,,
,,A good beginning to a day in Singapore,3,,"Beautiful views of the city, Marina Bay and the Gardens by the Bay. Unfortunately we went on an overcast day but we happened to get there at twilight so we enjoyed watching the city slowly light up. We could also see a lot of the preparation for the Formula 1 event the next weekend.

We tried to walk to the Flyer from Little India but it didn't work out so well. Plan your route carefully if you decide to walk. Great walking paths over bridges terminate unexpectedly without safe road crossing options.",,,
,,Breath taking,5,,The exhilarating experience of reaching those heights and from the very top being able to visit right into Malasia is in itself amazing. We did the trip twice over just for the very excitement of it.,,,
,,One great Day!,4,,I agree with louloubell when she say that its a must stop destination in Singapore. It was a nice experience and its fun to see Singapore from top. i will surely be back here. together with my friends.,,,
,,Very nice,4,,"You need a really clear day to ride on this, as even on a good day, there is still a slight haze on the horizon. I really enjoyed it but wondered why it was necessary to build such an extravagant attraction when there are so many tall buildings in Singapore, many of which have a viewing station at the top. It was also expensive, $33 for a half hour ride as they would not give tourists the senior discount whereas many other attractions do. We did it during the day but I think the night ride may be more spectacular.",,,
,,Good to see,5,,Good to see Singapore flyer and specially the children .. My 5 years daughter and my wife Really liked it ..,,,
,,Great views,4,,Excellent views over the city. This was a great part of our sight seeing whilst in Singapore. The staff were freindly and we thought it was reasonably priced.,,,
,,The ride to be experienced at least once in your life,5,,"My hubby booked 2 tickets for a Signature Cocktail ride as a surprise for my birthday in August. The capsule being used for this ride is their VIP capsule, which is much more decorated (Very classy) than the usual capsules. Not sure if the rest had a sound system but mine came with a separate Bose system which added to the ambience.

He had booked for the 6.30pm ride which was supposed to be the ""sunset ride"" where you can witness the sun set during this time but unfortunately for us, it was cloudy on the day we took the ride but to be fair, I can't fault anyone for this. Also because it is in end August, we get a bird's eye glimpse of some sections of the F1 track! Singapore's latest attraction, Gardens by the Bay, is also visible.

The overall experience was fantastic and I wouldn't be too surprised if numerous marriage proposals have been made inside the VIP capsule. This ride should be experienced at least once in your life.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,4,,"It was wonderful. I went on a rainy morning and had the flyer coach all to myself. Even with the rain, it was clear enough to see a lot of the island -- what a great view! I recommend this as a must see if you are in Singapore",,,
,,"Wonderful Views and Fun ""Old Style"" Food Court...",4,,"The Singapore Flyer is a must stop destination for first time tourists to Singapore. The wait was easy as you pass through a modern, interesting building full of unique exhibits. There on a Sunday, we didnt wait more than 15 minutes total. The flyer car was airconditioned and there was a single large bench in the middle for those who wanted to sit down. The views are phenomenal although a bit terryfying if you have a fear of heights. My oldest son had to be coaxed off the bench for a picture but quickly returned to his ""safe"" seat in the middle. The ride is slow and relaxing and although a bit pricey, I think worth it. We also walked to several malls in the area in search of a money exchange (there is not one at the flyer). We ate noodles underneath the flyer that were good and enjoyed walking around the grounds. All in all a great morning adventure in Singapore.",,,
,,breathtaking sights!,5,,"i took this twice, both in the evening. breathtaking sights! one of the must-go in singapore! after the ride, one can go to the hawker centre on the first floor to try famous local dishes, including the hokkien mee and cha kway teow.",,,
,,Impressive Fun and need lots of time here,5,,"It needs more directional signs here. Lots of shops, cafes, Takes 30 minutes around and big, I mean BIG. The water fall and gardens are lovely treat too. Take plenty of photos.",,,
,,Night Visit,4,,We did this at night as we did the Sky Park during the day. Great view of Singapore at night and well worth the cost.,,,
,,NICE !!!,5,,"I love Spore flyer !! Although a bit pricy, but its nice to see Singapore view! Should go there and try !",,,
,,Fly Hi,3,,"Great views of the city, unless it is raining. Access was moe speedy than the London eye, but involved more walking, and there is less to see and occupy the mind. Watch out for the starting grid of the F1 Grand Prix and for the floating football pitch.",,,
,,Fantastic view!,4,,This is a fantastic attraction. There is information on the construction from beginning to completion as you enter the building. The ride is approx. 30 minutes and is fantastic viewing from start to finish. Well done Singapore.,,,
,,Stable flyer in case you are afraid of high,4,,"It is a nice experience but do not expect too much because it is very slow and it takes only around 30 minutes, so take your camera with you and take some amazing shots of the city from the high and enjoy the wonderful view. Sometimes in valentines time, they set it as a restaurant where you can have dinner in but do need reservation with anticipation.",,,
,,Amazing View...be it day or night!!,4,,"Definitely one of the really good attractions in Singapore. On your way to the ride you pass through a few halls which show how the flyer was constructed and there were some other small structures as well (in case you want to click pics).

The ride was for about 30 minutes. The view is just amazing, not just at the top but from every point of the ride. you get to see the whole of Singapore and you supposedly get to see Malaysia and Indonesia as well (Though i didn't really know which was what.. just saw a bunch of islands far away!!).

The only negative point is that there is no narration of any sort as to what we were looking at. The management should should really consider adding that feature.",,,
,,Must do,5,,"The Singapore flyer is a must do in Singapore. You get such nice and different views of the city! And if you are lucky, you might get the whole capsule for yourself!",,,
,,Free with Singapore Airlines Stopover deal,5,,"Fantastic. Was thrilled to get vouchers for this (and heaps of other attractions) as part of Singpore stopover deal. Worth booking with Singpore airlines, just to get all the free vouchers",,,
,,nice experiance,4,,"The flyer has certainly added a feather in singapore's hat.The entry to flyer shows how the flyer is made and give various info about flyer.In flyer the 28 min ride will take you to all around views of singapore with singapore grand prix track and 5 star hotels,singapore harbour and all singapore skyline.",,,
,,Must go!,5,,Good value with great view and atmosphere - very spacious and clean cabin. The ride was smooth and you can enjoy the view with the assistance from the introduction by the PA system. Family orientated attraction - please look after the children during the boarding as the platform can be quite dangerous. Tips - try to go early as it can be very / super crowded during peak hours.,,,
,,Must experience,5,,I like the view fom flayer. You can see entire Singapore. Anyone who travel to Singapore must not miss this.,,,
,,So cool and steady,5,,"It was a great experience to take the flyer. So beautiful up in the cabin, can take many pictures and sight seeing.",,,
,,Not the best place to take pictures,3,,"The flyer was expensive than I thought, but the views were pretty good. You wont get good pictures since you are looking through the glass. We couldnt get any good pictures from the flyer, especially because it was raining outside [money wasted for us :( ]",,,
,,Expensive norhing great,3,,"Singapore flyer is when you ride in a capsule and get a glimpse of singapore its like a ferris wheel but a very relaxed ride inside the capsule. You could hardly feel the ride. All other activities were quite expensive fish spa was $30 which i think is overpriced, went into the weekend flea market but it was very limited choices better to go to chinatown for shopping lots of choices and a lot cheaper, overall i would rate the attraction as ok, something to do for half a day, food in the food court was nice they had fried oysters which was ver good and cheap and a must try.....would recommend the attraction 4 half day of nothing to do",,,
,,A nice view of the city from up high,4,,"It's actually a pretty nice ride, the mall underneath has some good and clean hawker food, and the view is pretty. Tourists in Singapore should probably either do this or the Sands Skypark if they enjoy high views of their destinations, both would be a bit redundant.",,,
,,world largest giant wheel,5,,"we like the cell design, ample space and great view from top. Spectacular view of marina bay---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",,,
,,big wheel,5,,"it was brillant ,the views from it were fantastic,the other facilities of the place were good as well,the gardens were so peaceful,",,,
,,Worth a visit on a fine day,4,,"A very typical tourist stop, a bit out of the way if walking, but easy to get to by taxi. Enables a good view on a fine day, the shame is there still isn't much to see! The view from the top of MBS is probably just as good, but not as memorable in terms of experience.",,,
,,"Excellent place for photo-taking the wheel, but everything around still under construction",3,,"not much to see as the area around still under construction. things may get better when the garden by the bay finishes construction. the carriage is very huge, but have to share with a lot of people.",,,
,,Great way to see across Singapore,4,,"After visiting with my wife this morning I would definitely recommend this. Although it was a bit overcast so we couldn't see out to the Indonesian islands, we got some great photos across Singapore and having read the guidebooks and been on a couple of bus tours, it was easy enough for us to know what we were looking at. Being big Formula One fans as well, it was great to see the length of the start/finish straight and the lights and stands all round the course as they were preparing for this years event. Great views down towards Sentosa, across the water to the dam and the ships on the sea beyond and also of several of the unique buildings like the Marina Bay Sands. Definitely worth a trip, especially on a clear sunny day.",,,
,,you should come by the sundown,4,,"to make the best of this ride, you should go about 5 o'clock,plus the waiting time, so all the lights from the buildings have lighten up, and you can enjoy the scenery of Singapore at its best, but if you have a phobia..well you shall make a back up plan and chose other option",,,
,,Very good experience,4,,"An excellent experience for 33 dollars per adult. The base of the wheel or flyer is full of shops and other activities such as a 6D experience, a flight simulator, and restaurants and gift shops.

There is the ability to take a luxury flight where you have gold padded seats and served champagne but it costs about double. We went during a hazy cloudy day and we saw pretty much everything and no queues. However it may be best to come at night when the city is really lit up. However there may be queues.

There is airport type security with searches, metal detectors x ray of bags etc. I thought it was a joke and it was them just pretending you were getting on flight but it is real.

There are activities to do whilst walking up to boarding the flight but they were fairly boring and mainly I thought for kids so skipped them after a cursory look.

Well worth a flight though especially if it's not busy.",,,
,,Very Smooth,5,,The ride was very smooth and you can see the entire city during the ride. They put about 10 people in one compartment. You can even choose to dine while riding the flyer. They have dining cars.,,,
,,Only if you have the time and spare cash,3,,"Nice to get up there for a view of the island but only on a good day. It would be nice to have a map so we know what we're looking at. The map should also include some history, like then and now eg ""Fullerton Hotel used to be the General Post Office"" and also how the small boats used to go out to the big ships to sell drinks and cigarettes.

No map, no information, no experience other than seeing buildings.

Do eat at the hawker centre at the ground level. It serves a great variety of excellent local food. Most of the hawkers are from very popular food stalls in other parts of singapore.",,,
,,Amazing,5,,"It was amazing attraction in Singapore..with S$30/pax,you can enter a flying capsule to view Singapore (MBS,helix bridge,F1 Singapore circuit,etc)..it's a must if you visit Singapore..and it not scary at all..just love the Singapore Flyer
But i think it may better if the duration is more than 30 minutes..",,,
,,Good location for outing with family,3,,"I was able to get a discount for tickets to SG flyer for myself, wife & baby daughter. good scenic view of East Coast, financial district & Marina Bay of Singapore.

We received food vouchers; but the food & drinks at the Singapore Flyer food court is some 20-30% more expensive than at regular food court.

can't blame the food vendors; it's the government controlled rentals that is high.

food court have marble topped small round tables for 4-6 people & bamboo chairs; which are a throwback to Singapore in the late 60's & early 70's (just after Singapore's separation with Peninsular Malaya)

to attract the lunch time crowd to eat at the food court, SG flyer allows for free parking between 12 noon until 2 pm.",,,
,,Great views and you can get a drink!,4,,"Well run, queues move quite quickly and the views are very impressive. Combine that with the fact you can get a drink on board, the 'pods' are nice and big and it is an experience well worth doing.",,,
,,Not worth the money,2,,"Boring - yeah the views were ok but you are trapped in a tiny capsule with 15 people all trying to see. It took half an hour to circle which was a little long and i was desperate to get out.

Maybe its just me and this is a little slow paced for me but for the money, i was very disappointed - it was nothing special.",,,
,,THE attraction for Singapore!,5,,"I've been to Singapore twice, and this is always on my list. The views from the top never get old! The first time I was a 'flyer' the Marina Bay Sands was under construction. But, this time, it was finished and the views of it and the Helix Bridge below were stunning. I couldn't recommend it any more highly. After all, it's the tallest wheel in the world -- bigger than the London Eye! This makes the Singapore Flyer the #1 do not miss attraction of Singapore!",,,
,,Pricey ride for an Eye,3,,"Before you proceed to take the ride, you will be brought to a showroom where there are information and details of the Singapore Flyer and some brief history of Singapore, in fact just very summarized stuffs about the history of the area. History lovers whom are trying to know Singapore better might felt disappointed. The best timing to take the ride is just slightly before the sunset, where you will have a better scenery seeing the transformation from daytime to evening than just being in the daylight / bright / sunny view or the night time with the usual lights from buildings and streets. In all, the ride is an half hr ride. Nothing more and nothing less. It's quite pricey to pay about 30sgd for this. Unless you have a deal of a package that involved duck tour or entry to the Gardens by the bay, it's really not quite worth it. But it is one of the icons of Singapore after all, so i recommend people to look out for packages deals that includes this Flyer.",,,
,,Nice Ride for 30-40min,5,,Good to watch Singapore from the top... Marina... HSBC.... Marlion.. good to go there... not much expensive also... :),,,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,"We could see the flyer from our hotel bedroom window and just felt it was something not to be missed. Lit up at night it is an awesome sight.
We went along and had no wait at all to board our pod. The pod itself is spacious and as it goes so slowly it is not at all scary even if you are not keen on heights.
The views over Singapore and the Marina Bay area are stunning. Make sure you have plenty of memory on your camera.
It really is a sight not to be missed.",,,
,,Like throwing $30 out the peak of the ride,1,,"What a waste of time and money. This is about upselling you stuff to take home.
If you want to see Singapore at night or during the day, you're better off with a reservation and eat or drink at top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel or paying the cost to go up there -- it is higher & a better view & you aren't stuck there for 45 minutes.
Singapore could have made its rival to the London Eye worthwhile & do what London did - provide you with some information about what you are looking at, about the land reclamation projects, about where the original Singapore ended and about what you are seeing.
But, nobody did that.
Instead you are riding in a glass bubble for 45-odd minutes with no information on what you are looking at.
All they have is a pamphlet in the bubble that is mainly advertisements for fast food (at the park where the ride is), stores & trinkets (you have to walk through a trinket-filled store to exit). The 4 or 5 items per each view (North, South, East and West) are on the bottom of the pamphlet in the corner.
The pamphlet's information about ""Top 3 must-try food!"" and ""Top 3 merchandise to bring home!"" is bigger than the information about what you are viewing.
No map. Nothing.
There were 2 kids aged 8-11 in my bubble, and they were bored to tears & began climbing on everything.
The London Eye is so, so, so much better for this kind of thing (there is a lot of history to see from it, but apparently nothing from the Flyer).
What a disappointment.",,,
,,Great views of the city,4,,We did this at the end of a city tour. It was a great way to get an overview of the city and we managed to take some fantastic photos. We shared the pod with only two other people so it was a very spacious and comfortable ride with us being able to walk around or sit down at will.,,,
,,Awesome,5,,"Typical Singapore, the biggest the best and spotlessly clean. Not keen on heights but it's so slow and smooth you forget where you are...really. A must do in SG!",,,
,,Great night view,4,,"Went at night, and the lighting in Singapore is all viewable from the Flyer, making the place look entirely beautiful. But what wasn't good - No small gap to take out pictures using the camera. The glass of the Flyer distracts the picture quality usually at night.

Still, for the experience, it was great and you would never feel anything different as if you are suspended so high even at the top-most point.",,,
,,Ok for first time,3,,This is ok to experience for the first time. It's a little bit pricey for something you will just ride on to look at the Singapore's skyline. I guess it's much better to go to MBS Skypark and pay $20. A lot more time and cheaper.,,,
,,Great Singapore view from top,4,,i think the view are more beautiful at night cause you can see Singapore with plenty of lights... the mall below also quite ok with a lot of food choice...,,,
,,Great views,5,,"This was pretty cool. Slow moving ferris wheel but enclosed ""rooms"". Great views of the city. This is part of the hop on hop off bus.",,,
,,Great for the kids,4,,went with my daughter who is 14 and she loved the experience-I thought the staff were friendly and professional-a nice morning,,,
,,Wide View Over Singapore,3,,"you can have amazing view over singapore up there while enjoying the ride, but unfortunately its a little bit overpriced for just single ride with nothing to do except sightseeing for 15-20 minutes",,,
,,Better than Marina Bay Sands,5,,"We were fortunate to have only one other couple in our cabin, so had great 360 degree views - go early in the day before the crowds. We went to Marina Bay Sands top deck afterwards - waste of money as the view was better from the Flyer, and it was lovely and cool in the airconditioned cabin.",,,
,,Didn't find it spectacular,3,,"Perhaps it was too hyped but didn't particularly find it entertaining. View wise wasn't too bad but could definitely have been better. Still had some construction views going on, maybe try again when all is complete.",,,
,,"Awesome views, shame about the service.",3,,"The Singapore Flyer providers an awesome view of Singapore, and the location is an easy walk from the M.Bay Sands. The cost is high, especially given the poor service experienced, but if you want great pictures for Singapore this is the one to visit. In regard to the poor service, we visited early to avoid the crowds, still the staff forced too many people into the flyer car ( the next few viewing cars were almost empty) meaning that the experience was unpleasant due to over crowding, jostling by some pushing toursts and unsufficent seating. In fact, disappointingly I couldn't wait to get off! My suggestion, refuse to get on if all seats are full, after all the next viewing car is only a few moments away... And you are paying for the view.",,,
,,Great view,5,,What a great view you get of Singapore. Even the wife and sister inlaw went up and were also suitably impressed (considering they don't like heights!!).,,,
,,Great for seeing Singapore from the air!,5,,"This was our second experience of the Singapore Flyer. Both times have been excellent and we have had brilliant weather to get a great view of the city and harbour.

The flyer starts with a exhibition which gives facts and figures about the flyer and compares it to other similar attractions around the world (i.e London Eye).

On both occasions we have not had to wait to get on the Flyer and the capsules have not been busy. There is a map of Singapore (free pamphlet) in the capsule which helps you to locate the various sights of Singapore. At the end of the flight there is a shop which sells souvenirs. There are also restaurants located at the Flyer.",,,
,,great if you get it free with your stopover holiday,5,,"was a good experience, very efficient, the weather wasnt so good when we went up in it so try and get a good clear day when you can, was free as was included with our singapore stopover vouchers, not sure idpay the full asking price for it, but cant beat it for free.",,,
,,A perfect view of Singapore,5,,"My family loved this experience although my wife hates heights so she was not a fan!!! The whole ""journey"" was wonderful and really allowed you to see Singapore in all its glory.",,,
,,Good experience even for people who are afraid of heights,4,,"My knees may have buckled a little when we were moving towards the top but the glass room were were in felt very safe and secure and there was enough room such that you can just sit on benches in the middle a little further away from the edge. It was a good experience but I also thought that it was just okay over all, and not one of those experiences I'd hanker to repeat. But otherwise, well organized, very clean, very safe, great views, well done.",,,
,,Stunning views,5,,The Flyer compares well with the London Eye and the views over Singapore are well worth entrance fee.,,,
,,"A unique, not to miss, attraction...",5,,"Since the Flyer has added the ""pre-flight experience"" this has become a ""must visit"" attraction in Singapore. It's a great way to see the city and get a feel for how the city grew in the last 20 years. Start or end with some food at the ""food trail"", a nice collection of hawker stalls in a throw back to Singapore in the 60'. good food and nicely decorated with genuin items from the days past...
If you're in that mood, try the Champagne flight or even dinner flight, well worth the money for a one off experience!",,,
,,Best way to get a birds eye view of Singapore,5,,"Its very well done, Try and get there early as its gets very busy. The views are great and after the first few minutes you don't even feel that you are moving.",,,
,,Best to do on your first trip,4,,"We nt on the flyer on our first trip to Singapore and it was well worth it. It gives you an opportunity to see the expansiveness of Singapore, there is so much to see in Singapore. The flyer moves pretty slowly so you really get a good chance to look about. We paid for the service where y get a free drink , go to their private bar and share the flyer booth with one other couple. That was well worth it.",,,
,,Outstanding,5,,"We were in Singapore for a week鈥檚 vacation, and this attraction was our first stop. It鈥檚 a bit frightening but well worth it in my view.",,,
,,I hate heights but ...,5,,this experience is not to be missed. Fantastic views especially of the Marina Bay and even better at night.,,,
,,Aaaaaaahhh!!!,4,,Beware if you're afraid of hights. I was so freaked out! 15 mins of the ride i think i just sat through the ride. you see everything from up there.,,,
,,Better than the London Eye,4,,"Fab journey on the flyer, we went on at sunset and had brilliant views of all the attractions of the city. Good value for money and much better than the London Eye!",,,
,,Better view during day time,3,,We had a good experience but it would be better if we would have a day ride as the visible level is limited at the night.,,,
,,Biggest & best ride of its type,4,,"It lives up to its hype, not only is it the largest in the world it also has to be the smoothest ride wise (normally I get nervous with heights).

We took the half hour 'high tea flight' which offered small tidbits & a drink (don't go in there hungry or thirsty. It's a snack, not a meal). The views were very good never the less.

Plenty of shops etc. around the base of the flyer to fill in time before/after your scheduled ride.

Handy hint: go to the bathroom beforehand as there is nowhere to hide once you're on board!",,,
,,Amazing views!,4,,This is an amazing way to see the Singapore landscape and beautiful city lights. The 30min ride is just right to soak the views in. Amazed to discover you can book a whole cabin for private functions; a really good idea. Must do while in Singapore. I'd recommend doing this in the evenings. Night scene is amazing.,,,
,,offers great views of downtown Spore,4,,It was four years ago since I last took the Flyer. The pre-ride exhibits are educational. Evening rides would be good to catch both the day and night views of Spore.,,,
,,The Ride,4,,fantastic ride...spacious capsules. great for families and groups. we had a very good time with our group. didn't realize when the ride started and got over...great view of singapore,,,
,,A birds eye view of Singapore seafront,5,,"It is a giant ferris wheel. Each car can take in at least 20 pax. It moves slowly so you have an enjoyable view of the Singapore seafront. You also get to see the many beautiful building surrounding Singapore. You will sure to point out several buildings and structures you recognize.

After the journey, you will get to eat at one of Singapore's best hawkers centers. The ambience and atmosphere is of the past setting. It is nostalgic and for those who visited or know Singapore in the 60s, this hawker center will sure to bring back wonderful memories..

A must visit.",,,
,,Awesome!,5,,"This is one place you shouldn't miss when you are in Singapore. Although the rates for one ride (SGD 30) seems a bit high, the experience is awesome. Must Visit!",,,
,,30 MINUTES IN SKY,4,,"This was a half an hour ride, vey slow could have been more fast, but you can slick all the pictures and get best of views of Singapore from the flyer. I would suggest evening visit.",,,
,,Neat at Night,3,,"We went on the Flyer at night time, right before it closed at 10pm. The city looked beautiful with all the lights sparkling. The ride itself was fun and leisurely. I just wish it had a map that pinpointed the major sites we were looking at. It was hard for us to know what each building was.",,,
,,Great attraction but check the weather,4,,"We went on a public holiday so the place was packed. To make it worse, the moment we arrived, we were told that the wheel was temporarily suspended due to the weather. The weather seem ok to us but perhaps the rain would result in static and stuff

So we decided to go for the 6D attraction next door (about SGD18 per person). Was ok but was expecting more like the 4D Shrek attraction in USS. Just plenty of shaking and wind.

We head down for a quick bite and within an hour, the wheel was moving again. It costs us SGD29.50 per person and a wait in the line for about an hour or so. It was worth the ride though. Slow and a good view of Singapore.

However, those going with young kids and the elderly, try to get a coach for yourself. Spaces were limited and they place up to 15 people or so in a coach. We didn't mind sitting on the floor though since the coach waas spacious.",,,
,,Bigger than mine.,5,,"This wheel is reported to be higher than the one in my capital city of London. I have been on both and I can confirm that it is.Not able to think of anything to not like about it. It is smooth,quite and well air-conditioned,and when I visited- not at all crowded.",,,
,,Awesome Views - Great Experience!,5,,"It was our first day in Singapore and we had just completed our morning tour of the city (not overly impressed) and had been dropped off at the Singapore Flyer. I had always wanted to do the SIngapore Sling experience at the Flyer so my husband and I purchased two tickets for 2.30pm. We decided to have lunch at the SIngapore Food Trail (hawker style food) and it was cheap and delicious. We arrived at the Singapore Flyer Guest Centre at approx. 2 pm and were asked to take a seat in the airconditioned guest lounge. We waited only a few minutes before a young lady approached us and presented us with our complimentary souvenir glasses and we were whisked up the elevator and on our way. No waiting in a queue here! Straight to the front of the line and we had our own private themed capsule, two singapore slings set out on a small table in the middle of gold padded seating, lovely music, incredible views of the city, Marina Bay Sands, countless ships waiting out at sea - we were very impressed and it was the high light of our first day in Singapore! Although expensive at $138SGD for the two of us we both thought it was well worth the money.",,,
,,Great view,4,,The view was great and the timing is adequate. Got some really good pictures of the city from various perspectives! Visited here on the day of our return journey so it was a great end to our Singapore trip!,,,
,,Worth a ride,3,,"... especially if one hasn't been on the London eye. Best time to take the ride will be late evening/twilight, when you get to enjoy the views",,,
,,"""Singapore Flyer, a fun and enjoyable way to see Singapore!""",4,,"Singapore Flyer is a fun way to see Singapore's cityscape and skyline. We enjoyed the ride so much as we got to see from atop Singapore's famous landmarks like the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands Skypark, the Merlion, the Esplanade, etc. While enjoying the view, we also had the chance to see and find a short way to our next destination,The Helix and the Skypark. There are many options on where to dine and we chose its Singapore Food Trail to experience the food hawkers.",,,
,,"No Queue, Very Informative Gallery",4,,"There is a great view from all angles. Each trip takes about half an hour. It is one of the essentials of the ""Singapore Experience"". After all, it is the tallest observatory platform in the world. Yes, even taller than the London Eye.

A Little Tip: The nearby Sands Skypark is also an observation deck and is basically the same as this, great views and all. I would suggest choosing just one.",,,
,,Better during night time,4,,I think the best way to go there is during night. You can see the city light and looks pretty. They also offer you a dinner or cocktail for extra price.,,,
,,Nice Observatory,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is a great way to see Singapore and its majestic structures, greenery and the river. It is a short walk from Marina Bay Sands if you're up to it. It is quite pricy but well worth the 30 minute experience...families with young children will enjoy the view and will be able to identify important landmarks within the vicinity. Its a nice activity if you can spare the time...",,,
,,Round and Round,5,,"The entrance was surreal and the experience breathtaking. A tranquil, quiet, ever changing view of of the great city of Singapore",,,
,,Nice views from the flyer!!,4,,"This is my first time going on to the flyer, although it is a Sunday afternoon and queue is long with many tourists, the staffs were still able to keep everything in order. The gallery before going in to board the flyer is very informative, explaining the process and ways to build the flyer.

When in the capsule, the view is very nice! From different height, you can take nice picture from different angles, and overlooked the nice seafront view and the city view. The Marina Bay Sands and various iconic building are in front of you, it is a very good experience, and a chance for you to take many nice picture too!

After the ride, you can use your ticket to get some good deals from the shops around it! We had used our tickets to get a very delicious indian buffet lunch at one of the indian restaurant at $10 each!!!

I would recommend those who have not been to the flyer, go and have a ride, and you will not regret.",,,
,,Great views. Must do,5,,"Club your Singapore flyer trip with a visit to marina bay sands hotel and gardens by the bay
Singapore flyer offers great views of Singapore . The capsule is big enough and has place for sitting in case you don't want to stand by the window!! There is enough room in the capsule for kids to run around and not feel cooped up. The entire loop takes about half an hour.
A good time to go would be around 5 pm so you can get a daylight view and then do gardens by the bay by night all lit up it looks beautiful",,,
,,View of Singapore high up there!,3,,"A spectacular view of Singapore, especially of areas like the Marina floating platform, Gardens By the Bay, MBS etc.

Despite the much hype of the Flyer since its opening, I would rate the entire Flyer experience as mediocre.
A 30 minutes ride up was spend just looking around at the tiny figures below (people who looked tiny to us from up there) and the surrounding areas. Few quick snaps of photos and before you know it, the ride's over.

For those who have a fear of heights, being on the flyer is definitely better than trying to conquer your fear of heights through activities like abseiling, flying fox or even a roller-coaster ride. This, is so much safer, enjoyable and serene.",,,
,,Impressive,5,,"We had never done a 'big wheel' attraction in a city before and did this as it was included in one of the city tours, it was really worthwhile. We went at night so the views were incredible. There is even an option to pay a bit extra and go in a cabin where they will serve you champagne!
Definatly worth spending the time to do this.",,,
,,Great experience,5,,"The singapore flyer is an amazing experience for folks who wish to get a scenic overview of singapore and marina bay. The ride is approximately 30 mins - its quite peaceful and scenic. The views from the flyer is breathtaking and the seating capsule can be turned into a romantic getaway at nights. Do try it and take in the amazing views of singapore :) Apart from the flyer, there are quite a few amazing restaurants and shops within the flyer's terminal building that is worth your attention.",,,
,,Great experience,5,,"I hate heights so my first experience of a ""flyer"" had to be the worlds largest didn't it!! However the whole attraction was run with great efficiency, the trip was smooth and the views were great, really enjoyed it and worth the money and the effort to get there (its a walk away its really not much of a trek). they could make more of the shops and restaurants around it but overall it was great and i'm glad i did it.",,,
,,Nice observatory !!,3,,"This was first visit to Singapore and Flyer was touted as a must visit attraction. No doubt its an engineering marvel and city view is breath taking. Specially the river side and newly opened Garden by the bay.

however 30minutes inside the capsule were quite uneventful. There were no directions or running commentary of what you might be able to observe.",,,
,,nice to look to whole singapore from bird view,5,,Good time is afternoon. You can see all singapore in half an hour. Little bit expensive. After flyer you should be walk trough to Marina bay,,,
,,good attraction,5,,"As we are from England and we have the London eye, we had to do this. It was well organised and the views were spectacular. It is definaley a must do attraction as well as the top of the Skypark observation deck which was within walking distance. At the base of the flyer, there were many eating places including an authentic Indonesian food hall which i ate in the rest of the family went to Subway (boring).",,,
,,A sight to behold,4,,Took us 30 mins to finish this ride. a little far from the train station but the view on top is just amazing. Nice glimpse of singapore,,,
,,The BEST,5,,This wheel is bigger then the one in London and I was amazed at the sights that can be seen from the wheel. I thought I would be afraid being so high but because you are enclosed inside the capsule you don't think about the height and concentrate on the wonderful views,,,
,,Fantastic views,5,,"I loved everything about this, although it is extremely high and it seems to go up and up forever. Good value for money.",,,
,,Just sit back and relax...,4,,"We went on a weekday and it was not crowded.

The sky was clear, the weather was hot and sunny. We were happy to be in the air-conditioned capsule to enjoy the panoramic view of the city. I would think the view will be fabulous when the city lights up at night. The Flyer moves slowly and it takes approx. 30 minutes to complete the ride. Children may get bored easily as the only thing you could do here is to sit back and relax.

If you plan to get to the Flyer by MRT, alight at The Promenade Station (Circle Line) and take Exit A. There are no prominent pedestrian signs but it was not a difficult walk. Once you are out of Exit A, you can see the giant observation wheel. Just cross the junction, walk past a small bus terminal, and within 10 minutes, you are at the Flyer.

And do remember to bring your camera!",,,
,,Went there during sunset,4,,"The ticket is a bit too expensive for me (as im a budget traveller), but its still great nonetheless... I went during sunset, and it made the view even more pretty as the sky changes color and the city lights started to light up. It was even better because the flyer wasnt crowded that day, no lines, and we got the whole capsule for ourselves. It was nice :)",,,
,,Wow,5,,We did the High Tea tour on the Flyer and it was wonderful. This was a surprise for my friends and we felt very special. The capsule was all set up when we arrived and the food and coffee were of very good quality. While it only took 30 minutes it was plenty of time to enjoy the views and the food. Very good value for money I thought too.,,,
,,Best Seat in the House,4,,"Even for those with height issues, the Flyer is quite acceptable. It moves at a snail's pace, you hardly realise it is moving, doing one full rotation in just over 30 mins. The cars are big, with a comfortable centre bench seat for those who don't want to look down and can easily accommodate over a dozen people, without feeling claustrophobic. And if you're lucky enough to get a clear day, the view is definitely the best around.",,,
,,Extroadinary view,5,,"You get to see vertually all of there city. If you get good weather, we had it a bit drizzly day but it still looked magnificant, take lots of photos at all different levels. Its huge!",,,
,,Awesome first night in Singapore,4,,"My wife had never been to Singapore so I took her for a surprise dinner on the Flyer. The staff were very professional and attentive as we were welcomed to the Lounge to await our flight. We were ushered to the capsule by a security guard, feeling like celebrities! The views of Singapore were incredible and there was ample room with just 3 other couples, making the atmosphere very romantic. The first relolution afforded us enough time to enjoy our starter and soup. Although I am a vegetarian, I am not convinced that the salad starter had no bacon in it! I ate it anyway and it was delicious! The second rotation seemed a little rushed and my wife had a stone cold chicken dinner, but the staff offered to cook it again when we arrived back at the Lounge (although why would you want dinner again after ice cream!) I was also disappointed that my unfibished beer was swiftly taken away before we had arrived back. The experience was, however, really great and the staff were very attentive; we were well looked after. The only big negative was one of our fellow diners, very loudly objecting to the ""poor service."" Her complaints were totally unfounded and her attitude to the staff (who did everything they could) was disgraceful! To end on a positive note, the Flyer is a must do experience, especially if its your first time to the city and while expensive, the dining experience adds a romantic element and is certainly unique!",,,
,,About ok,3,,"Singapore flyer itself was probably nothing great, but the complex had a lot of interesting areas. The access takes you through a kind of science museum focused on the flyer, to me that was much more interesting and fun than the flyer.",,,
,,Good sightseeing option,5,,"Went in May 2011, is a great way to get a view of the city. I would go again as Singapore is constantly changing.",,,
,,Have to do it at least once,3,,"One of those must-do things when youre in Singapore - the views are great and it is the best way to see the City and country in general laid out before you - it is though, a giant Ferris wheel, and the last quarter of the rotation is pretty much spent looking at stuff you saw in the first part of the ride!",,,
,,singapore flyer,5,,"Excellent views over the city, a memorable experience for the family. Cost $29 adult, $ 20 child. 30 mins in the air. No queues as went during off peak period.",,,
,,WHEW,5,,Excellent way to see singapore in the glimpse. its better to go in day time so you can actually have very nice pictures of all over singapore,,,
,,Scenic Views Of Singapore And Beyond,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is a giant observation wheel, and standing at 165 meters, is currently the tallest such observation wheel in the world. Boasting views of up to 45 kilometers, which is longer than the length of Singapore, the Singapore Flyer incorporates award winning design into the wheel, which sits amidst a commercial hub along the water front.

Whithin the commerical hub of the Singapore Flyer, is a Greek Theatre, as well as a Tropical Rainforest. Also located here is the Singapore Flyer entrance, which passes through the Journey Of Dreams Interactive Gallery.

Generally, the highlight of the Singapore Flyer is viewing the surrounding scenery from one of the capsules. While the most basic flight will suffice, generally, the more expensive flights provide a much better experience.

Visiting the Singapore Flyer during the day allows you clearer views of the entire island, while visiting the Singapore Flyer at night allows you to view the city scape in lights. You'll also be able to see parts of Malaysia or Indonesia.

If you're planning a visit, do note that while general admission is free, to actually get onto a capsule for a flight costs a minimum of SGD $29.50. Flight time of 1 rotation is about 30 minutes. Try to allocate between 1 to 2 hours for viewing.",,,
,,High tea on the flyer,4,,"The flyer is 163m and a rotation will take around 30mins. The view is spectacular and well worth the effort. We choose to take part the high tea which that has recently been added. It was nice to enjoy a coffee and some snacks while enjoying the view. High tea cost $S120 for 3 pax, which is reasonable since the cost of a flight is around $S25 each. There are also perks, such as jumping the queue and relaxing in the lounge before getting on board. You will need to share the capsule with a couple other people (we had approx 6 others), but there is more than enough room.
Regardless of if your choosing the high tea or just a normal flight, booked online as they offer discounts.",,,
,,Glad we did it!,4,,"I wasn't sure about going on a ferris wheel, but was pleasantly surprised. We didn't have to queue long for tickets and tickets were reasonably priced. I think it took about 30-45mins to complete the ride, which was a good amount of time, but it wouldn't need to be any longer.
Great views of Singapore. Right near Marina Bay Sands area, so you could do that area and the Flyer in an afternoon. I think there is an MRT stop right near the flyer, but when we were in Singapore it was the F1 race so we had a little trouble getting there with things being blocked off, so just be aware if travelling to Singapore at that time of year.",,,
,,Would not go the 2nd time,3,,It was pretty much a slow 30minute being up on the flyer. You might be awed by the sights for 10minutes and will be wondering where to go next for the remaining 20minutes.,,,
,,A good way to get a view,4,,"While not a scenic as the London Eye, the Singapore Flyer is a good way to spend some time in that nice city.
I had the opportunity to join the a Champagne event on board a capsule and it was an nice event. The views are outstanding, the service very friendly, the only drawback is that if you do it, make sure to drink al the champagne, as they will not let you take unused bottles of the pod.
The scenery is excellent",,,
,,Fabulous...Must visit,4,,Went to the Flyer with my grandmom..It is actually an amazing experience.. 360 Degree panoramic view of the City. Also services like wheelchair are damn good. The view is brilliant and the cabin is real good. We had the entire cabin to ourselves. Also it is a gr8 area for a photo pop.,,,
,,Fantastic Views,5,,Went on the Singapore Flyer about 8.30 in the evening the views were fantastic and the experience was great even better then the London Eye,,,
,,Nice Ride,5,,"Hopped on this huge Ride with friends, you jump and do stuff inside this huge tube and it won't move! simply awesome! :D And the views.....",,,
,,attractions in singapore,4,,"Was a good experience, great views from the top great photos to be taken.
Not very expensive either, the only down side is would have like a speaking guide as to what buildings were what etc.... other than that very nice worth a trip if you are there!!!!",,,
,,Was so looking forward to this,5,,A slow trip around with views that were breathtaking. We saw the new gardens from up there and there was plenty of time for photos.,,,
,,"Wonderful views, amazing place.",5,,"The whole place is incredible. It is like a science museum for kids on the way through the buliding to the ferris wheel. The carriages are very large, enclosed and stable... you walk all around in there getting pictures from various angles. If you are the sort that is afraid of this sort of thing, I don't think you would be in these. The architecture of Singapore is fascinating and this is a truly wonderful way to really get a look at it all. The Koi pond and gardens in the courtyard are very pleasant and there are a lot of choices for getting some food or drink, too. A very central place to catch a tour bus, too.",,,
,,Another Singapore Hit,5,,The worlds biggest viewing wheel is well worth the slightly expensive price. Discount tickets are available from travel agents in Singapore. Would recomend the night time for unique views.,,,
,,Start your trip here!,5,,I would definitely recommend starting your first day here at the Flyer. It gives you a great perspective into the size of Singapore and its surroundings.,,,
,,Great views and great fun,5,,"I was not particularly keen to go on the Flyer but I am glad that I did. We had a cabin to ourselves and were able to get great views and photos. A bit expensive but well worth it. It moves slowly so there is plenty of time to enjoy the experience. Avoid some of the expensive eateries and go to the nearby area where the street food hawkers now have their stalls under cover. Delicious street food, immaculately clean, very tasty and cheap.",,,
,,Raining!!,4,,"Just as we took off the rain came down and plenty of it, so photos were limited sadly but an awesome experience and defiently a must do if coming to Singapore. *Dont forget to use your Singapore Airlines boarding pass for discount for this attraction!!",,,
,,An eye on Singapore,4,,"Money well spent. Singapore Flyer gives us a 360 degrees view of Singapore. Truly amazing view. If you are a couple, do try out the singapore flyer dining experience. Nice food and something different.",,,
,,The best view of the city!!!,5,,"for 30 minutes (this the duration of the ""fly"") I enjoyed the best view of the city!!! The pits of the F1 are just in front of the Singapore Flyer so if you are there during the F1 race you can even enjoy the race from high above!.",,,
,,Best eagle height views,5,,Definitely worth doing to have a good view of Singapore in all directions and a sense of city geography,,,
,,Fun Fun Fun,4,,"Don't normally do these things, but it was worth wild for a tour of Singapore and to help get your bearings. Went early in the day, very little line up.",,,
,,LOL never again...,3,,"The flyer is fine....it's big...really big. Has amazing views of the city, and you tower over almost everything there except the tallest skyscrapers. This was our second time on it. (first time was actually the 2nd week it opened). THe problem is always crying babies! IT's a headache for 30min!!",,,
,,Great view,4,,The only way to see Singapore. We elected for the basic 'flight' which took around 40 minutes to complete. The short waiting time to board the flyer was welcome. I would recommend this activity,,,
,,Nice to see all the boats...,4,,"Our family of 4 visited and enjoyed a nice round in this giant ferris wheel. The top gives a great view of Singapore, showing the huge number of ships coming and going from the port. The view of the city is nice as well, including the view of the Marina Bay Sands.",,,
,,Superb View,4,,"Very good view from the POD. Best time to go in evening,although there is huge queue in evening. Next to Marina Bay so you get good view of Marina bay sands,Raffles quay & Marina barrage.",,,
,,Stunning views,4,,A definite must if visiting Singapore with wonderful views all over the city as well as all the shipping anchored in the Straits. Do not forget your camera!! You have your photo taken when you arrive and it is ready to collect when you are on your way out through the gift shop!! You don't have to purchase it if you don't want to.,,,
,,Ok; not great but this is the tallest ferris wheel in the world!,4,,"Cool factor exists that this is the tallest ferris wheel. Takes 30 min to go around. Time it so that you can see the city in dark w/ lights. Combined with duck tours and these people offered a toddler price for my young son. Nice of them. Usual touristy things - lights, models, souvenir shop, photos etc. You will get a good view of the marina area. OK to go; not a must.",,,
,,Great paranomic view of Singapore downtown,4,,"Enjoy local food at one of the restaurants at the base of the Flyer. Before taking the 40-minute ride, it's best to use the restroom first. The view is best in the evening when you will be able to enjoy the city lightings as they come on.",,,
,,Not to be missed!,4,,"Bigger than the London Eye and better views of this magnificent area of Singapore, covering the new Gardens by the Bay, the Marina Sands and the host of shipping anchored in the Straits. You may also see Dragon boat racing below..",,,
,,Beats the London Eye hands down,5,,"Lovely, went on the cocktail ""flight"" and had 6 people in the pod on the way round, the cocktail was lovely, and afterwards we were given boxed commemorative glasses.
We timed it so that we were going around as the sun set behind Singapore and it was truly breathtaking.
Great Service. A MUST!",,,
,,Alone on the flyer,5,,"Awesome. The vision is great, the experience quite long (it lasted 30 min) and the staff so helpful. Me and my boyfriend wanted to go alone, but the capsule are for like 50 people... well we asked, with no hope... and tadaaan!
Alone on the capsule... so romantic :)
Loved it... 100% recommended. (and to be Singapore, it was not that expensive, considering this is the most expensive Asian city I've been so far)",,,
,,Just wonderful .,5,,"Amazing view - must for all visitors , my suggestion is going at sunset .. you will see Singapore by day, through dusk and at night. Just wonderful .",,,
,,great views,4,,"Really enjoyed the flyer, it is very well done and organised and of course the views are amazing. The only negative is that it is relatively expensive for a family.",,,
,,Round and round!,4,,A very large Ferris wheel with all sorts of extras. Bigger than the London Eye. Using Singapore Stop Over promotions we gait it for free!,,,
,,Going around in a big circle,4,,A rather large Ferris wheel! We got the trip for free using the Singapore Stopover promotion. Worth the visit.,,,
,,Views over Singapore,4,,"A must for all visitors - day or night, we went at night and it was an excellent experience. Only criticism is the signage to get tickets, was not very clear and had to ask.",,,
,,Go just before sunset,5,,"This is really worth doing for fabulous views of Singapore. If you go just before sunset you will see Singapore by day, through dusk and at night. Plan to arrive around 6pm so you have time to buy the ticket and get through the displays before boarding the flyer.",,,
,,Great way to see the city,5,,We went on the flyer during the day and our friends went on at night. We thoroughly enjoyed the views and if you suffer from vertigo it is handy to be able to sit down in on the seats in the middle.,,,
,,Okaye I guess....,3,,"Being a local, when it was first opened, my family and I just had to try it despite its ridiculous prices. It was clean. Thats actually all I could say. Great environment and all that but way overpriced restaurants. We took a couple of pictures and in the garden and went off.

But, it is worth a mention that the quality of the ride was superb, where you cant feel the cabin moving (people with motion sickness need not worry!). Because of the glass panels, we ended up 'communicating' with passengers from another cabin (with our hands of course).

Playing charades and making faces at strangers certainly is memorable but I just cannot bring myself to give it more than a 3 stars.",,,
,,What a view!,5,,"The Singapore Flyer goes around so slowly it doen't feel like it's moving at all. Great photo ops and great views of the city.

It's a bit of a walk from the metro, consider taking a taxi, especially if you are walking over to the Garden by the Bay afterwards.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Well if you have done the eye in London then do this too, great views of Singapore and surrounding areas.",,,
,,Amazing View Of Singapore,4,,When I first went in it wasn't very busy as you went through the displays and information points but when I got to the actual flyer there was a small line up but nothing much. Once you are actually on the flyer it takes a couple of minutes before you start to get any good views but once you get to that stage the views are absolutely amazing. The car that I went in was nice and clean and there was about 15 people in the car which was no problem. Over all a must do if you are in Singapore and not afraid of heights.,,,
,,Go on a fine day,4,,"This was good but we got caught in an electrical storm, they stopped letting people on the flyer but had to allow the others to get off. Still felt safe though. Worthwhile doing especially if it is included in a Singapore Airlines stopover as it didn't cost us anything to do.",,,
,,Take care to choose your ticket,3,,"The regular ticket costs a third of the special ones. Make sure you get what you want. You're not paying extra for the drink, but for the private and nice car, instead of overcrowded and dirty regular car (we went with the latter). If you go with a regular ticket, don't expect to be suprised in any good way. The view is great, but if you want more, go with a special ticket.",,,
,,Superb,5,,"I went there twice, once with a friend and once with family (once during twilight and once during day). Thoroughly enjoyed the experience. You almost never feel the movement of the wheel.....

It is best when you combine the flyer ride with a duck/hippo tour on the same day.",,,
,,Great Views,4,,"More fun in a larger group. On non busy days, you can ask to have a whole car to yourselves. Views are great. Plaza downstairs is boring. Marina Bay Sands is walking distance.",,,
,,great views of Singapore,5,,"A terrific way to see panoramic views of Singapore. Combine it with a Duck and Hippo Tour, and you're all set.",,,
,,Not quite the London Eye...,3,,"The Flyer is a nice attraction and the staff look after you well, but I couldn't help thinking it's in the wrong place, more so now the SkyPark has opened next door (which is higher!). The ride lasts about 30 minutes and it's fun to do, but the experience isn't anywhere near as good as it's London counter part.",,,
,,One of the best views in Singapore,5,,"This gigantic ferris wheel offers about a 45-minute vertical tour of the skyline. You get one revolution for Sg $29.95. The tour takes place in a comfortable, enclosed and air-conditioned pod which guarantees comfort, regardless of the weather.

The safe, comfortable enclosure, however, also takes a bit of the experience away by isolating the rider from the outside environment.

The views of the Marina Bay Gardens, the Harbor and the city are breathtaking - be sure to bring your camera.",,,
,,Worth doing,5,,"This was super, hate hights but was fantastic and would well recomend. Such a view to see evrything Singapore has to offer and that is loads. Worth every cent.",,,
,,Fly over the world,5,,This is a must when you go to Singapore - 30 minutes of great views and a nice way to understand the layout of the city.,,,
,,Noisy Kids,3,,We were put into a capsule with a group of noisy children which spoilt our time on the Flyer. The sights where reasonable but it was a bit hazy so not good visability.,,,
,,a 360掳 view of Singapore City central area,4,,"The Singapore Flyer experience was a great one. If you are keen on taking an aerial shot of the city center, this would be a must-go. I agree with some comments/reviews that the best time to go there is during sunset which is around 6-6:30 pm. Unfortunately, the rain has just stopped on the time of our scheduIed ride, (based on our itinerary and validity of our tickets. We got our tickets as a add-on to our half day city tour by Viator. We did not make right after the city tour for our tickets are only off-peak which is until around 5:30 pm s we went back the next day).

I thought I'd get scared a bit with the heights but didn't. Good thing. After the entrance and on the way to the capsules, the management strategically put some interesting displays and photo ops. I think partly to encourage tourists to buy the pics and minimize queue time.

The price may be a bit pricey from a tourist-coming-from-a-developing-country-point-of-view, like me, but that's given since I'm in Singapore. For the general public, you get a good value from what you paid for.",,,
,,"Exciting at First, Kind'a Exciting Still the Second Time Around",4,,"Had the chance to ride the Singapore Flyer again. But this time it was free thanks to omy.sg and the Singapore Blog Awards. Still I didn't miss to go around this giant wheel. There are newer sights to see now than the first time I rode it especially with the opening of Gardens by the Bay. Yet, the way down for me can still get kind of boring. But it is a must-try especially for first-time Singapore travelers!",,,
,,A must! Go VIP!,5,,"The Singapore Flyer seems like just another tourist attraction, but it is an awesome ride. Make sure to check out the specials. We found a great 2-1 Singapore Sling VIP promotion on a flier at the airport. The VIP capsule is deluxe and is not packed full with people. Even if we hadn鈥檛 received 2-1 I would have paid the upgraded price, as there was no waiting in line. Oh, and the sling was so tasty! Do not miss this ride! Buy your tickets early! http://www.singaporeflyer.com/unique-experiences/singapore-sling-flight/",,,
,,For a friends birthday,3,,"Catered carriage was very nice but with rain and airconditioning, it wasn't easy to get a clear photo. The A/C fogged up part of the window. The view was great, but think I'll give it a miss of offered again.",,,
,,"Superb, you have to do it!",5,,"The Singapore Flyer is very well organised, surprisingly inexpensive and offers a 30-minute 360 rotation, with fabulous views of the city. Well worth it and I loved it!",,,
,,The Wheel,3,,Well organized and nice experience but nothing utterly interesting. The place at the Flyer that captured my heart was the Kenko fish spa when the doctor fish clean your feet from dead tissue. Also nice shoulder massage and other spa treatments are available. There are multiple Kenko outlets in Singapore but this is the best at the Flyer (http://www.kenko.com.sg),,,
,,Pricey,3,,It is like the London eye and takes 30 mins. It is quite scenic but pricey for the basic option. We couldn't see the Merlion but had decent view of rest.,,,
,,Well worth the price,4,,"Leaving aside the psychadelic launch tunnels you walk through that explain how the flyer was built and what it`s purpose is, the experience itself is amazing. And this comes from someone who is afraid of heights! Views are better than marina bay sands in my oppinion and because you are moving, you get different aesthetic perspectives on the city almost constantly.",,,
,,Great views,4,,"We have been on the flyer during the day & also at night. We were in a pod with other people but had plenty time for photos, the ride takes roughly 30 minutes. You get great views over Singapore & also Singapore bay.",,,
,,Great Experience,5,,"Its a one of a kind experience. I am afraid of heights but in Singapore Flyer, fear was overcome because the movement of the ride is very slow. You will not feel anything while watching the entire view of Singapore.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Amazing views over Singapore. Very peaceful, relaxing way to enjoy Singapore. We went at dusk which was a great time to go. No crowds at all. Loved it.",,,
,,360degree Beauty unfolds,3,,"Its kinda pricey for a 30minute ride. If you will go to Marina Bay Sands, I think you can skip taking this flyer. Its good to see from afar and even unclose but taking the ride, you can see the beauty of skyline from other higher structures like MBS.",,,
,,Unobstructed view of city sky line,4,,"Tourist should make this part of their itinerary as it gives you a 360 degrees unobstructed view of Singapore! CBS, the port of singapore, the sea with hundreds of ships, and all the surrounding islands.

You should ride it at different times of the day for different view as it is different. eg one in the noon, one at sunset and one at night. If you only have time or cash for only one. I would recommend going at dark (night, after 8.30pm)

Rather pricy $30 for a 30 min ride, especially for locals. however would be worth if you are on holiday here!",,,
,,Panaromic view of Singapore skyline,4,,A must-do for visitors and locals alilke. The cabins are roomy with 360 degree view. Be prepared to wait during evening time. My visitors had to wait for 45 minutes to get on.,,,
,,A worthwhile experience,5,,We went on the Flyer & had a snack at one of their cafess. Got a great view from the top! It was worth it just to know we went on the largest ferris wheel in the world!,,,
,,A worthwhile activity,5,,"We spent one hour there, including the Flyer & a snack at one of their cafes. It is on the city tour stops so very easy to access.We enjoyed it very much!",,,
,,Worth the extra for a Sling Flight,5,,"I visited in November 2011. Having been lucky enough to get a discount voucher to take a Singapore Sling flight for the price of a regular flight I opted to ride twice to see if there was a great deal of difference between the 2 options.
Obviously the view was the same on both flights but I did find the music and more comfortable seating on the Sling flight made the journey more enjoyable. The Singapore Sling served in flight on the Sling Flight was absolutely delicious as well.
I really liked the Hokkien Noodles from the food trail under the Flyer too.",,,
,,Good stuff!,5,,Great views and a smooth ride. When the surrounding area is developed more it will be spectacular. Arrive early in the morning so you have no crowds.,,,
,,Very good view of the city,4,,"There is plenty of space in the cabin, with 360 degree views. The ride lasts about 30 minutes, which is enough time to take some good photos and take in the views of the city.",,,
,,An hour at Singapore Flyer,3,,"We were there at 1:30 pm, it's nice view from the top..Here are photos from my blog http://www.thomasabeesh.com/2012/07/22/singaporeflyer/",,,
,,Great View,5,,Definitely a good thing to do in Singapore as you get a great view of the city and it's relaxing and seems very safe,,,
,,Can't beat the view,4,,"Seems like every city in Asia now has a giant ferris wheel. But this one is particularly giant, climate controlled, and offers spectacular views of a beautiful city and harbor.",,,
,,Pick the right timing for a value-for-money ticket,4,,"It was my first time up the Flyer and boy....What a spectacular sight! As a Singaporean, I have a rough idea on what I'll be seeing but it's so much more magnificent up there!
Tips:
1) I board it at around 7.05pm, browse through the gallery and board the flyer at 7.20pm. I saw the evening and night view. Value-for-money isn't it?
2) Choose the bench on your right as that's where you see the Esplanade, Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay etc.
3)Grab the map in the capsule and study it carefully so that you know what you are looking at or looking for.
4) Our National Day is just round the corner, so if you come on Saturdays (28/7, 4/8) which are the parade rehearsal days and the big day itself( 9/8), board the Flyer at 7.50pm and when the capsule reaches its peak point, you might just get to see an awesome fireworks display! Not sure if these are blackout days though, but well, even if you can't board the flyer, just hang around the area and you'll still get to see the fireworks, around 8pm. Just a reminder that you have to factor in the gallery walk which leads you to the boarding of the flyer, so you might need to enter the place earlier.
5) The Singapore Food Trail below the Flyer serves good and reasonably-priced local cuisine with the environment set in the 60s era, furnished with props and antiques. This is probably one of the few places in Singapore that really serves good local food that is set in a tourist spot, trust me. Give it a try when you are there! With the wide array of food, you'll probably be spoilt for choice so a tip is to really see what others are eating and follow the crowd, your instinct and your sense of smell.",,,
,,Great Views at Night,5,,"The SIngapore Flyer is one tourist attraction worth your time and money! We visited at night and were dazzled by the views across Singapore. The cabins were comfortable and spacious (given the number of people travelling in each one), and the ride was smooth throughout. Despite the Flyer being visited by so many, we did not have to line up for more than ten minutes. Highly recommended!",,,
,,A good view from the top and the fireworks make it great,4,,"I like the view from the top but it can be rather boring for frequent singapore traveller more or less the same like view from new asia-equinox or mbs..however during my 'flight' they had national day parade rehearsal so we enjoy the fireworks
I dislike the inconvenience getting in and out the cabin..can be challenging if you with elders or young kids..suggest they can make the cabin steadily pause for getting in and out",,,
,,Its all about the timing,4,,It can be a very nice experience if you get the time around 6:30 pm so that you are on the flyer during the sunset. Then its a really nice view. You also have to be lucky to get a capsel that is not so full. If you visit SG thats a thing to do.,,,
,,well organised,5,,Take a taxi unless you are fit. It is a fare walk from the closest underground station. Taxi's are cheap . We didn't try the buses but I believe they park outside Great views of the city and river Plenty of room in the carriages..,,,
,,Boring,2,,"Not much to do and see, specially when it is mid of the day.",,,
,,Scenic trip - not to be missed,5,,"The Flyer offers a fabulous scenic experience of Singapore and gives you an brilliant perspective of Singapore City and surrounds. It takes approx 30 mins to go full circle and you will take some great happy snaps that will capture some of Singapores highlights - most notably the Marina Bay Sands.
Dont visit Singapore and leave the Flyer off your list ! It is a must do activity in my opinion!",,,
,,nice experience..,4,,"booked via their website, so we had a due date to comply.. we went there around 3 pm but unfortunately the flyer were closed due to heavy rain, we were worried since the keeper said they were not sure on what time the flyer will operate again n even it could be on the next day while we had another plan to do the next day.. thankfully when we went there again at 8 pm the flyer already operated again.. n on 2nd thought, we feel blessed to be at the flyer at this hour coz the lights from the cities are amazing.. which we could not get if we fly at 3 pm before... :)",,,
,,top of the town,5,,A must see with views over Singapore and half an hour of spectacular sights.Worth the ticket price.,,,
,,A good experience for a first-time observation ferris wheel ride,3,,"Much-hyped and worth the ride only if one is going in for an observation-feeris-wheel ride for the first time just to know how it is. However, for people who might already have gone on the London-Eye or some such, this is an avoidable experience as there's hardly anything new about it and the views are just ok. One gets to see the formula 1 pit from the capsules though, which is otherwise closed to the public sometimes.",,,
,,Nice experience,5,,Very huge and nice experience to see the Singapore city view,,,
,,The singapore flyer is very big and you have a good view of the city,4,,I think it were a little too expensive also i thought you got a better view from The marina bay sands sky park for the same price,,,
,,Fantastic.,5,,"I had been checking their website and noticed a deal, 2 for the price of 1 for the Singapore Sling trip. This worked out the same price as the 2 of us doing this without the sling so we went for it. Totally worth it. Amazing views, only 4 other people in our pod. Which was one of the flash ones. The Singapore Sling tasted great and the views were spectacular. Don't go past the food court on the lower levels much more authentic food than was served at most restaurants - we were the only Europeans there on the 2 nights we dined there. The beer was a great price too!",,,
,,The best Eye in the world.,5,,Not expensive and gives you a perfect overview of all that Singapore offers. I believe now you can book one of the modules for a butlered dinner!,,,
,,Gorgeous views,5,,This really should be on your list of ''must do's'' when visiting Singapore. The views are outstanding!,,,
,,"nice view from the top, but so so",3,,"went there with boyfriend, found the trip quite enjoyable but the AC is too cold and no ""in flight entertainment"". the pre-ride section was quite nice, like a mini museum about the singapore flyers.",,,
,,Should Go,4,,Vew was excellent and currently world's talest wheel. Memorable experience,,,
,,Champagne!,5,,Definitely book the champagne flight... at around about 4.30pm-5pm. We had the capsule to ourselves - it was very lovely.,,,
,,lovely view from upthere,4,,"Just by the singapore formula 1 track, get an excellent view of singapore from Singapore flyer... i recommend you to go in the evening time...You can even reserve there for a fabulous dinner. you wont feel moving until you realize you are in the top...must go and see ..",,,
,,lovely view,4,,While the flyer is reasonably priced for a family of four it can be costly however the view is worth it and only a certain amount of people can go in each capsule at once so you do not feel at all closed in there is plenty of room to move.,,,
,,Worth visiting,5,,"This is a big flyer where you can view indonesia if the weather is good, each turn is about 30mins .Below there's lots of resturants where you can dine. Buy tickets from the traval agent(Lucky Plaza level 3) will get a better deal.",,,
,,Nice Cocktail service,5,,I visit many countries but not see this type of VIP protocol. They give us exclusive capsule with excellent service. Our whole family enjoy very much,,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"It was a great experience, the views are amazing and it isn't as scary as I had imagined. I would highly recommend it.",,,
,,Very nice view at sunset,4,,"We decided to take the ""tourist"" route and see what Singapore had to offer. We thoroughly enjoyed our ""ride"" around the Singapore Flyer and we'd recommend it if this is your first visit to the beautiful Singapore. We'd recommend it just before sunset...visit the Hawker's Stalls at the base of the wheel...YUM!",,,
,,Nice quick high-tea,4,,"My husband and I had the high-tea onboard the Singapore Flyer on a Wednesday afternoon on my birthday. It was a nice quick getaway from 'sea-level Singapore' where we got to see some pretty lovely views of Singapore city. The food was great but eating was a little rushed as we had to manage our time between taking in the view and actually eating. It was also too crowded for my liking - there were about 12-15 of us in one capsule. I guess it'll be ok if it wasn't for the high-tea, but with the food trays there and the bartender, it got a little too cramped and picture-taking could only be done with some maneuvering and definitely with other people in the background of your photos. Worth a visit if you have nothing else to do, but don't expect much. It was only for half an hour.",,,
,,163m Tall,4,,"Yes it is 163m tall and takes 30 mins to complete 1 rotation for which you pay $29.00. The capsules are smooth, and you hardly know you are moving. The views are great, the seats are comfortable and the noise of the wind highlights the fact you are in the air. Worth a spin.
Plenty of hawker food available at the facility.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer Review,5,,"So, going to the tallest Ferris wheel of the world was a nice experience and it was nice !",,,
,,Great views,5,,All air conditioned; very quiet on the week day we visited in September. Gives a real sense of the city as you get views in all directions. Definitely recommend a visit.,,,
,,A good experience,5,,A great experience all round. Suitable for all ages. Great in the day for picture taking and I hear it is great at night with all the lights of the city shining!,,,
,,Must try when visiting Sinapore,4,,Very organized and very accessible by public tansport. I love the experience and truly reommends to tourist in Singapore.,,,
,,Lovely view of the city,4,,If you are traveling with young kids this is a great way to stay cool and enjoy the city view for 30mins.,,,
,,Fabulous views!,5,,Stunning views from this flyer. Enjoyed our trip on it.,,,
,,Get high!!,5,,"A trip on the Singapore Flyer at 9pm at night was amazing!
A view like no other over Singapore late at night with all the lights ablaze gets your senses buzzing
Having ridden on the London Eye last year was a real experience and I didn't think it could be topped until now
A must trip for all-try it at night after a beautiful dinner in Singapore",,,
,,Have to once at least,5,,"We were going by the airport bus so we had about one hour before the bus came back, so the Singapore flyer was the best thing to do. For the price it was good. Very comfortable and great views all around. We went around 6:30 pm which turned out to be best as we saw day, evening and night views. The entire round takes about 35 mins. But remember getting to the flyer will take an additional 20 mins - there are many things to see before you actually get on the flyer.",,,
,,Expensive but worth it.,5,,If you fly Singapore airlines you will get a discount if you produce a boarding card on booking the tickets. This isn't advertised and can save you a bit of money. The flyer is a must for tourists !!! It is worth the expensive ticket prices.,,,
,,Magnificent view,4,,"went on the singapore flyer last wednesday when i came over to singapore with a group of friends we managed to book our tickets via this website known as changi recommends, we managed to get the tickets at a cheaper price too!!!however, there were not many deals available there.

the singapore flyer was amazing, especially since i went at night. was in awe for the whole 30 minutes, it was definitely worth the $$. but for those who do not enjoy looking at views, the singapore flyer might not appeal to you, as you will pretty much just be standing there, taking an overview of singapore.",,,
,,Nice ride,4,,"It's a nice ride, worth to go. However, get boring after the first 5 or 10 minutes. Even so, worth the visit, specially at dawn.",,,
,,Nothing much special!,3,,"It looks great, it sounds great... It is ok if you want something different but frankly speaking, I don't think it worth the money. Nothing much special at all.",,,
,,Beautiful sights,5,,The Singapore flyer was amazing. A little bit of a wait to get onto it. The capsules on the flyer are air conditioned and there is a seat to sit on so that you're not standing for 38 mins as the flyer goes around. There were definitely some beautiful sights to see so the Singapore flyer is something to go on to see a beautiful part of Singapore.,,,
,,Great views!,4,,This is a bit pricey but is a slow and steady view of the area. It is NOT a ferris wheel but a slow moving observation wheel. Each capsule fits 28 people and takes 28 minutes to make one rotation. You do not feel the motion and can relax and enjoy.,,,
,,Go at night,4,,The views of Singapore are spectacular. Plenty of time to take pics and you'll see the city from a whole new perspective. Not cheap but worth it.,,,
,,We went for dinner and it was amazing!!,5,,"My partner surprised me on our recent trip to Singapore with a dinner on the Singapore Flyer. I am not great with hights so I was a bit nervous at first, but the flyer moves so slowly that you dont really realise that you are getting higher and higher. It is actually more like you are eating in a restaurant with a view, which I guess you are. The meals are well suited for the set up with a starter (ceaser salad) and soup served on the first rotation, and when you get the the bottom again, the staff very efficiently whisk the plates out and the main meals and desserts in, while it is still moving! The rotation does not stop so you enter and exit while it moves along. The main meal (we had the lamb) was a delicious lamb shank with potato mash and veges, all of it was supurb. Dessert was a selection of maccaroons, little cakes and chocolates, which was enough and very tasty. There are no toilet breaks while you are on the flyer so go before you board! It is also VERY cold, and they can not adjust the aircon for individual captules, so I would recommend taking a light coat or jacket. And remember to take a camera. The night views over Singapore are beautiful.",,,
,,Little slow for young children,3,,Our two young children (3 & 5) found the ride a little slow so got a bit bored,,,
,,Wow!,5,,"We visited in July 2010. My son was very keen to go on this, but I am not comfortable with heights. However, we both went and enjoyed the experience. A plus for me was that we went during the week, so there was only one other person in the capsule with us. The views are just awesome! There was so much to see as we enjoyed the ride, such views of the city, the harbour, the buildings and so close to the Marina Bay Sands Hotels that you could take wonderful photos. Our ride was in the middle of the day, but it would be a great experience any time of day.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer.... A Must Visit.......,5,,Great View of the City.... Well managed... Value for money. You can get 20% off ... many promotions available.,,,
,,Nothing to see,2,,"Sorry, but this is little more than a giant ferris wheel ride. The views are poor, as there is actually very little to see a par from hundreds of ships at anchor, and Singapore's skyscrapers. Neither of which are particularly pleasing on the eye.
I get the feeling they just wanted to build something bigger than the London Eye, just for the sake of it.",,,
,,Simple and good value for money,4,,A good price for a simple tourist attraction. Very will managed and some good views.,,,
,,Amazing view of Singapore,4,,"The view is excellent. Based on advice we got from Trip Advisor forum, we went there around dusk, so it was really good as we rotate to observe the sunset & the city to light up.
There is also an excellent food court on the ground.
Tip: Show your Singapore Airlines to get 20% off the admission price. Buy directly from ticket booth, not from the travel agent next door.",,,
,,The flyer..is just like the eye of london,4,,Just like the eye of london.. The flyer..is just like the eye of london,,,
,,Flying on the top!,4,,"We went on the Singapore flyer due to my 6 year old son's insistance. And I do have to say it was an experience. My son loved it, but wanted it to go faster. The whole ride takes about 1/2 hour, and you get a good birdseye view of Singapore and the surrounding area. However, having done this, I would probably not do it again.",,,
,,Largest wheel in the world.,5,,"This is a great way to see the city Of Singapore, especially at the top. A must see attraction",,,
,,Great views,5,,We recommend taking this big wheel for a ride. It affords beautiful wide-screen views of the city.,,,
,,Great Views,5,,Well worth taking this wheel ride. Amazing views of the city.,,,
,,Fantastic views over Singapore,5,,"We loved our time on the Flyer - one rotation takes 30 minutes which is enough time to take in all the views over Singapore. We loved the views over Marina Bay, including Marina Bay Sands, and the different angles of it from different heights. The new Gardens by the Bay also looked great from the Flyer - next time we'd try to take a ride at sunset.",,,
,,Always check their promotion or package before buying tickets,4,,"Already visit and try this last year.. so in this trip I plan to didn't board the flyer but just drop my friends and let them enjoy the wheel flyer. When buying the tickets at the counter there is promotion of air, land, sea package on the weekend only. The price is the same with the regular flyer tickets but we get extra of marina cruise for 45mins and sightseeing to several places with open bus top (an hour).
SO i change my mind, i bought the ticket to get the extra attractions that i didn't try before.
The flyer flight just 30 mins and everything is just same like before, they only modify the hallway to the flight which they call journey of dream (not too impressive)

Keep asking for promotion before buying tickets, because they wouldn't tell us if we didn't ask.
For the flight experience, try once and that's enough, u'll be bored for the second time.",,,
,,Fly with the Flyer,5,,"It is one the upcoming attractions at Singapore. With a breath taking view from the top, one can have a splendid experience being here. The most beautiful thing about this flyer is that it never stops... Even when people are boarding or alighting the cabin, the flyer keeps on moving, though at a very slow speed. A maximum of 28 people can fit inside one cabin. Inside each cabin are kept handful of maps which one can hold and trace different places and attractions from the top. You can have an aerial view of the Golf Course, Merlion Statue, Side View of the Marina Bay Sands, and much more... Overall a beautiful 45 minutes ride from the top..",,,
,,What a view,5,,"Really enjoyed the flyer, views are amazing. Capsules have air con and move very slowly so a very relaxing 40 mins",,,
,,"Nice, reliable dull.",3,,"It takes you up and down and all around. Singapore looks nice from up the air. But compared to the London Eye, this is a but a runner-up.",,,
,,Like London Eye,4,,Another way to see 360 degree singapore view. Similar like London Eye.,,,
,,like london eye,5,,this is same as london eye....view from the top is great experience....really enjoyed with the family,,,
,,A good view,3,,The Singapore Flyer provided us with a good view of the city. We went because we had 8 days in Singapore. If you have 1-2 days there are other attractions I would go to before this.,,,
,,Worth a trip - great view of the city,4,,"A slightly bigger version of the London Eye. It gives a great view over the harbour and the Marina Bay complex and the view of the city whilst not as impressive is good. It is relativly expensive but worth the flight

If you are a GP fan you can also walk along the pit straight which is right next to the flyer (you dont need to buy a flyer ticket to do this.",,,
,,Executive spin,5,,"Brilliant way to see the views of Singapore, paid for the champagne spin, a bit more expensive, however this meant jumping an enormous queue and having our own pod, it did make a big difference and well worth the extra. Dusk was a great time to see the City in all its splendour.",,,
,,A nice way to watch the sun go down,4,,Caught the MRT to Promenade Station and did a short walk to the Flyer. We need to queue for tickets then then security check then the flyer itself. The queues moved quickly and they had lots of displays to keep us entertained while we waited. We got into the Gondola just before sunset and had 30 mins to watch the city lights come up and we enjoyed the view. The ride was very smooth to the point where you could not really feel the movement of the wheel. A an experience it was well worth the 30 singapore dollars.,,,
,,Every City has a Wheel!,4,,The wheels are popping up in all cities but this is definitely worth a visit; gives you a great perspective of Singapore and has beautiful gardens as part of the attraction,,,
,,amazing view,5,,"well worth the experience,you get an amazing view of Singapore,from the ships out at sea ,marina sands,and all the arcitectually designed buildings...great photos.they have a nice souviner shop where you can buy photos,which they take as you walk in of you with 6 different backgrounds....what a great idea then you can download from the internet",,,
,,Smooth ride and great views of Singapore,4,,Great way to see the city. Loved the views. Recommend buying tickets online (for a 10% discount) 鈥?they are good for the day of purchase. And go at an off-peak time 鈥?otherwise the lines can be long.,,,
,,Around and around.,4,,Went there in the evening so didn't see as much as I could. Sight was great though. Pretty much all a ferris wheel can be.,,,
,,Fantastic - a must do,5,,Amazing views in air conditioned 'cars'. The entrance building could have a better layout.,,,
,,SIngapore Flyer Review,5,,Singapore flyer is the latest attraction for tourism. The ride in flyer is amazing which goes to the top at 360 degree. The view is beautiful.,,,
,,good but expensive,4,,it gives good view of singapore surroundings but is expensive. also it gets over within 30/35 minutes. you should take it on weekends when there is free river cruise included!,,,
,,Average But Expensive Ride,3,,"Made a reservation for dinner. I made the reservation under the impression that we'll be having the whole cabin to ourselves. I was wrong.

Arrived & checked-in, and was informed that we'll be sharing the cabin with 4 other couples. As I was planning for a romantic Birthday celebration for my wife, naturally, the news dampened our mood. In addition, we were informed that the Birthday Cake that I'd reserved through Singapore Flyer's online reservation could NOT be taken onboard for candle lighting, all in the name of security. So if I'd like to light the candle, I'll have to leave the cake @ the lounge, and to light, cut and have our cake after the end of the ride!

As the duration of the dinner will only last 2 rounds of the ride (approximately 60 minutes), we had to have a pretty rush dinner while trying to enjoy the view. Bread, soup & salads were consumed quickly, so that the butler could clear in time before we conclude the 1st round, and that's when the main courses would be transferred into the cabin. And there we began another round of food gobbling, as on average, we'd only have 15 minutes for main course, 5 minutes for desserts and another 5 minutes for coffee/tea. If you're really good with the timing, then you'll have additional time to take one last glance at the night scenery before the round concludes, and you'll be promptly ushered out of the cabin.

One positive point: the butler is a young lady, around her early 20s. However, given the tight timeline, she had been most professional and courteous throughout the whole duration. Despite having to serve and clear, she was very efficient, and had even managed to squeeze out some time to assist us diners in taking pictures and explaining briefing on the different sights of interests. Kudos to her, a perfect job done!",,,
,,"Great view, but an expensive view !",4,,"I've been to Singapore on many occasions and have passed the 'Flyer' by on every trip as I never had the time to experience it ! Having now had the time, it was good to have the opportunity to experience the views, and great views indeed. Just a little soured by the cost. More should be done to support more tourism, but the cost here does not support the view !!
Superb support for disabled passengers, the flyer is stopped for their benefit and great care is shown for them by the operators. There is a 'Dining' cab on the flyer, although, not sure how much of a meal you could have in 30 mins !!",,,
,,Very touristy and a bit too expensive for what it is.,3,,"Let's face it, if you're in singapore for the first time, you'll consider doing the Singapore Flyer. You get a good view of the city, but in my opinion it is a bit expensive for what it is.",,,
,,Great Experence,4,,Really enjoyed the flyer and it is a great place to see all over Singapore and great if you like to take photos,,,
,,Fun for all!,4,,Visiting Singapore flyer had always been on my list ever since I had passed for the first time in a cab in front of it in 2008. My wish came true in May 2012. At first I had thought that only kids would be interested in visiting the place but was amazed to see people of all ages enjoying the place. I wish I could have stayed a bit longer.,,,
,,High Flyer,4,,"Must do thing in singapore, great view especially at night. i was there during the formula 1 races, n had a good view of whole ..he he...",,,
,,"Good view during daytime, maybe even better at night",4,,"Paid SGD29.50 per person for an experience to ride in this world's largest giant observation wheel. Had a nice view of the Marina Bay but it might have been better at night. Also did not try dining in the Flyer so it would be unfair for me to say that it's a waste of money or boring.
Singapore Flyer is a venue which offers unique dining experience overlooking spectacular view of the surrounding area. It also offers nice vantage shots for souvenir photos.
The Flyer is a unique awesome structure. 30 minutes just went by but we definitely had a nice and enjoyable experience.",,,
,,Life time experience,5,,If you are visiting Singapore and if you are not visiting this place then there is no meaning of going to this country. The half an hour journey in this giant flyer was life time experience for me. The scenes you can see from the top of the flyer was amazing. Dont even forget to take a trip of this giant flyer.,,,
,,An average experience,2,,I was expecting a great site but i was offered with the views of a lot of buildings and a sea full of ships :( The view from Mount Faber or Bukit Thimah Nature reserve is better and free.,,,
,,Fly High,5,,"The Flyer is yet another must in a city full of wonder. It hardly moves and gives fantastic views over the bay, the East coast, Suntec City and the newer areas of Marina Bay. Especially lovely when the lady says welcome to the top of the world as each pod reaches the very top.",,,
,,Awesome Experience,5,,We had dinner in the Singapore flyer. The view of the city in the evening was awesome. The food quality and service standards were much beyond expectations. Wonderful opportunity for a bird's eye view of Singapore glowing with lights at the night. A must try for Singapore travellers.,,,
,,Impressive,4,,A good 30 minutes acitivty. Lots of photo taking opportunity. Enjoy the view and take a walk on promenade after finishing the flyer ride.,,,
,,Giant observatory wheel,3,,"You can see Singapore from up above in 360 degrees from the capsule. the ticket is rather pricey and a bit boring when we were rolled, but any faster than that, the ticket price would be too expensive anyway",,,
,,A must do!,4,,"This is a great way to see Singapore. It only takes 30 minutes to go around, in air conditioned comfort.",,,
,,a big ferris wheel,5,,"went there for the first time pay around more than 30$ singp a person. great view. aircon, much like london eye.. they tried to seperate each group but somehow you'll end up a stranger on ur cabin.. then later i found out that if u buy it at a local travel agent it only cost 20$ singp a person. and valid for 3 months..

btw if u come here by taxi is kinda hard to find taxi. especially on rush hour..",,,
,,afternoon Tea in the Flyer,4,,We did the afternoon tea circuit. It was quite good. The service was great but the tea was a mix of scented and herbal. I missed good old English breakfast tea! I thought it was worth it but my wife felt it was a bit overpriced.,,,
,,A Must Do in Singapore,4,,"This is fantastic, you must go on the flyer, views are out of this world. S$59 for two which we thought good value. Lots to do in area around the flyer, f1 track, shops etc.",,,
,,Awesome,5,,Try it you won't be disappointed. Fantastic views and plenty of room in the pods,,,
,,Fantastic Ferris Wheel,5,,"Absolutely fantastic ride on Singapore Flyer especially when we had our ride in the late afternoon, during sunset!",,,
,,Biggest flyer,4,,"It was the 1st time i exprerienced the real flyer, except something for kid :) I felt really amazing. Singapore is small and very concentrated, so from top of the reel you can get an overall view.",,,
,,Enjoyable,4,,"A slow ride, giving you enough time to look at views",,,
,,Don't Get Premium Tickets If You Don't Want Get Haressed,2,,"We booked on-line in advance for a Singapore Sling Flight which costed double the normal price hoping to have a nice & Romantic time as a couple with 20+ years of marriage. We were offered access to the VIP Lounge. Then we,we're escorted for boarding. Everything sound perfect, right?

The answer is WRONG!

There was a long line of customers waiting to board the flight. As we were escorted through special line with just a rope seperating us between the crowd, we felt tension as all eyes from the normal line were looking at us. As we get nearer to the boarding area (separated by a simple rope), we heard people booing at us! One Chinese from a group tour yelled ""why"" for severy time.

In our minds, we are wondering why we had to pay extra money to be harressed like this.",,,
,,great,5,,"fantastic but, there were 28 in our capsule and 5 of them were children running around. We had to be alittle pushy in getting from one side to the next but make sure you do walk around and look from all area's. Is it worth it yes. Ive done london eye but enjoyed this one just as much. When you get back down get your chilli stingray from the food court as it was fantastic though I did have to take the chilli off the top.",,,
,,Romantic ride not to be missed,5,,"It is one of the romantic rides when you are travelling Singapore with your love one. My recently ride with my fianc茅e in early June during her birthday was a romantic experience. We had the Singapore Sling deal and was put into the Moet capsule鈥?just the two of us. The views was magnificent overlooking Singapore city skyline, Marina, east coast etc. If you happen to be in Singapore, do give it a try and you won鈥檛 be disappointed!",,,
,,"Another ""must-do"" done..",5,,"This contraption is definitely worth visiting, we lined up for about 20mins, it was airconditioned so no sweat! The staff were efficient in moving everyone along, and once in the pod with 18 other rubbernecks, the views and experience was fantastic..",,,
,,Expensive spin on a big wheel,3,,"We tried the Singapore Flyer which is pretty similar to the London Eye for a fee of SGD29 per adult. It was approximately a 30-minute slow spin which gave us an aerial view of Marina Bay and surrounding area. It was pretty cloudy and drizzling while we were on board so the view is not that fantastic. We wondered if paying SGD20 to go to the Sky Park at Marina Bay Sands would have been a better choice and experience.

It was a pleasant ride but unfortunately, there's really nothing to rave about it.",,,
,,Same old.,3,,"If you've been on the London Eye or anything similar then don't bother with this....save your money and use it for a drink at the top of the Marina Sands hotel in the Skybar, it will buy you a couple of Coronas and the views are way better.",,,
,,Expensive ride,4,,"This is a good touristy activity. It is pretty expensive but was an enjoyable activity. It was a good view of Singapore and we got some good pictures.Basically it is similar to the London eye but the pods are even bigger. They take about 20 people.
Children would enjoy it.",,,
,,Excellent,5,,Great views across Singapore. A short walk out of the Promenade MRT.,,,
,,Save your money!!,2,,"A quite boring and expensive half an hour with a bunch of screaming, unruly kids. I couldn't wait for it to end.",,,
,,It seems like someting any one ought to do but truly Singapore has more to offer,3,,"Singapore has so much to offer...and I am not sure the singapore Flyer is really one attraction not to miss... It is interesting for the ""technical"" part of it and the fact that it is a quite incredibly high wheel. But the views are not brilliant and I have seen much better views on Singapore, particularly the marina bay from restaurants (Fullterton Bay Hotel and Level 33). And of course from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the access to the roof top of which is actually cheaper.
Having said that, it is very efficient, no long queue, calm. there is a few shops, a little garden with fish to feed to entertain the kids before or after the ride, toilets, souvenir shop..
From there it is very easy and quick to walk to the bridge linking to Marina Bay sands",,,
,,Brilliant Views,5,,The Flyer had fantastic views of the whole city and also it didnt take took long to get round either. The map provided is a little deceiving though as the Merlion in the Marina looks huge on the map but you can hardly see it from the top of the wheel.,,,
,,Impressive,5,,"Great view of SG and the surrounding islands and even MY. It really was a treat, blue skies and no clouds so we really enjoyed this. Attention, flying SQ is giving you a discount here! Keep your boarding pass, it is worth 20%!",,,
,,comfortable,4,,"each flyer compartment was spacious and comfortable, the ride was stable, the view was ok; I think the price was a bit expensive",,,
,,Birds eye views,3,,Views were great but you can see the same things from the top of the Marina bay sands for $20.00,,,
,,An experience.,5,,"Am a bit scared of heights and confined spares but went on anyway, you have to live after all, and it's the biggest in the world. Found out later about all the problems they had with it, having to keep reversing the directions etc. Fantastic viewes obviously. Slightly concerned when out pob reach the apex then lurtched forward violently. But I survived! Highly recommend.",,,
,,A great experience,5,,"We really enjoyed our trip on the Flyer and the spectacular views we got. I booked in advance online and we also received a 30 minute scenic river trip and 30 minute open-top bus trip, so found it great value. We went mid afternoon on a Saturday and only had to wait 5 minutes to get on the flyer and didn't find the cabin crowded. We were also there one day at lunchtime and enjoyed a great meal at the Singapore Food Trail foodcourt, a great opportunity to experience a variety of local delights in a unique setting.",,,
,,Great views!,5,,"Great views, go in a group and take the 30-minute ride up and around!",,,
,,Beautiful!,4,,Loved it tho a couple chairs would of been nice!! Tho the dinner idea is great!,,,
,,Great views !,3,,"Definitely great views, but I was staying at the Marina Bay Sands and the view from my room on level 50 was the same, so only worth it if you don't get to go to the rooftop of the Marina Bay Sands.",,,
,,Go to One Altitude for better value for money,3,,Was a nice ride but you can get a better view from One Altitude located in the CBD! and much cheaper,,,
,,Boring鈥︹€?,3,,"I'm a Singaporean and seeing the surrounding which i am familiar is not exciting. Other than the fact, it may look nice as some point, it's not worth to visit. There's other place where you can see more of Singapore.",,,
,,The views were worth the wait,4,,Out timing was a little out as we arrived just after a number of large tour groups resulting in a 30 minute wait to board the flyer. Once we were onboard the wait was quickly forgotten about as the views over Singapore were great. The ride was smooth and comfortable.,,,
,,Great views!,5,,"Great value for money and great views! we took some amazing photos, good way to see Singapore",,,
,,Excellent view of the city,4,,"The best time to take a ride is during sunset when the lights of the city are just coming up.
Thats the perfect time to take pictures. The ride lasts for about 20 mins and is worth it. My mom, who is scared of heights was initially apprehensive but came along after much convincing. She was barely able to tell when we reached the top coz it moves very slow. She didn't regret it. A unique experience for tourist.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Well worth a visit, the pods aren't crowded, only 5 people in ours so plenty of room to wander around. Fantastic views of the city especially right at the top.",,,
,,"Its good, but not great....",4,,"Buy ticket online, costs 26.55 SGD or 1191.675 INR. You save some dollars if you book and pay on their online booking site.

Timing: Daily, 08:30am 鈥?10:30pm

Show your passport at the ticket counter and you will get S$ 5 food voucher inside Singapore trail food (food court under Singapore flyer). Enough for your food and drinks.

If the weather turns bad, give this place a miss.

The best views are still standing up next to the windows.

You will find the tickets booths conveniently located at:
*) Promenade Foyer, Level 1 (Between Popeyes and Seafood Paradise)
*) Coach Bay Area, Level 1

The cost was $29.50 per adult for a standard ticket.

The Flyer is 150 metres in diameter, 165 metres high, and travels at 0.21m per second (it is some 30 metres taller than the famous London Eye!). Takes around 30-45 minutes, try to visit at around 7pm to 8 PM- so u can see the view before it gets totally dark and after the lights are up.

When you've done the Flyer, walk across the helix bridge to Marina Bay Sands to catch the laser light show and have an Ice Kacang for a late dessert!

The ride time for full cycle is about 45 minutes in which you can view the beautiful city of Singapore from a great height (max 165m). The observation capsule is shared by multiple people and it can accommodate max of 28 persons. One can view the F1 circuit right below, Marina Bay and many other spots of the city. The audio guide can be used for pin pointing the known landmarks of the city.

Great views when on top; they say you can see Malaysia and Indonesia if not cloudy.",,,
,,Fabulous Views,4,,"Staying just across the road from the Flyer I felt I had to go and check it out, I'm not a great fan of heights so was a little apprehensive but found the 'flight' as they call it, not scary at all. You are in a large capsule and although I did have to sit down when we hit the top, it was pretty great for views.

However I think its pretty pricey at around $28 SGD per person for 30 mins, if memory serves me right and I didn't even bother looking at the photo they took when you go through the displays but they were extra on top of the ride fare.

I also found it a shame that people in my capsule really didn't care for the fact that everyone else also paid to see the view and stood up and hogged most of the windows, not sure what the maximum number is in each capsule but we had 15 and it wasn't easy to get a decent window view with people pushing past you but that was just my personal experience!!!

Night time view would be beautiful also but I prefered to save that for one of the roof top bars with a nice glass of bubbly!!! You can also have a night ride on the Flyer with a Singapore Sling if that is of interest to you!",,,
,,Seeing Singapore from the Flyer,5,,"We got to the Flyer by the Hop on Hop off bus tour. The Flyer is the highest observation wheel in the world, beating the London Eye by 5 metres. We only had six people in our pod so we had plenty of room to move and see Singapore. The Flyer, like Singapore is very clean and was very nice to ride in",,,
,,lovely view,4,,You can observe what the lanscape is really like from the top. You can also have great photos. We bought a combined ticket for the hop on hop off bus + the flyer + boat trip so the price was cheaper.,,,
,,Great attraction a must do!,4,,"Singapore Flyer is fab! But as yet, no direct link to it with MRT. So take a taxi or do the 10 mins walk from Theatres on the Bay.
Some replica hawker stalls for you to dine in, but there didn't seem to be many interesting retail outlets esablished yet. Still looked as if it was growing into itself.",,,
,,Boring and very expensive!,2,,"For just 30 min rides, and nothing else, this attraction is very expensive, not to mention the charges for picture which is 20 sgd each and 60 sgd for whole package.Not worthwhile at all. With such price, it shall include photo and others. Will never go there again. But if you want to go, better ride at night, colorful.",,,
,,Great Views,5,,The first day we came to visit this we arrived just as a thunder storm started and they closed it but told us we could come back the next day with our ticket. We arrived at around 10.00 and had a capsule to ourselves which meant we could rush around and take pictures from all sides. Fantastic views. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit.,,,
,,Great experience,5,,"Well worth doing, a little daunting when you feel like you are hanging out in the middle of nowhere. Fantastic opportunity for photos.",,,
,,Bad view and rotating,1,,"Hi everyone, I went to the Singapore Flyer in March this year for the first time and this was terrible, yucks! So expensive and you expect people to pay so muuch for it! Although they say there is a terrific view on the top, it was so fake! I really thought I had wasted my damn time there. So don't go please. Thanks.",,,
,,Lovely Ride,4,,This is worth the ride when visiting Singapore. Before you get onto the main attraction there are lots of interactive info and facts about the flyer which was interesting. The line moves very quickly and it is not long before you are put in with others to the large capsule. There is room to stand or sit and it is a pleasant 30min trip with great views and photo opportunities of Singapore.,,,
,,Great way to see Singapore,5,,"I was a bit apprehensive about this as I hate ferris wheels & roller coasters, but friends said it was not to be missed. It wasn't at all scary, breathtaking views & an amazing piece of engineering. There were only 5 other people in our car, so we could all walk around to see out & take photos. If you only have a limited time in Singapore this would be the best thing to do.",,,
,,Nice but better the Sky Park,4,,"Expensive , and when you visited the Marina bay sky park , you don t need to visit the Flyer.",,,
,,Only for those with time and money to waste,2,,Ho-Hum experience - don't be fooled by all the positive reviews as I was. Problem with all these observation wheels is that they take forever to get up to the top. View from top is nothing special and better from Marina Bay Sands. When we went visibility was restricted by haze and pollution that is endemic to Singapore. Unless you simply want to waste 2 hours you will be bored. We and our children were.,,,
,,Birds Eye View of Singapore,4,,"The Singapore Flyer was included in a package deal I purchased and I was in the area so I decided to ""check it out"". The observation wheel is efficiently run and queues work through quite quickly. The views from the wheel are stunning although quite similar to the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which is quite close by. The half hour trip was good and the glass capsules provde great vision in all directions.",,,
,,"One of the most romantic thing we did, ever!",5,,"Though it was a bit scary because me and my husband are both afraid of heights.. We had a grand time during the ""trip"".. Very romantic!",,,
,,better view up MBS,3,,Better views up at the marina bay sky park. go there insetad!,,,
,,A must!!,4,,"The views are amazing, as you could imagine. I went during the day so I could see so far away. I dont know what night time would be like.",,,
,,Brilliant views...and cost effective too.,5,,Absolutely loved this attraction as the views are terrific. We shared a cabin with an incredibly annoying family that insisted on singing nursery rhymes to their small son the entire time. But we enjoyed ourselves and would certainly do it again.,,,
,,Cool,4,,"A very interesting destination, unfortunately, a bit expensive if you have kids.",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Just as good if not better than the London Eye! Not long queues.,,,
,,Great views and a slow ride on this huge ferris wheel,4,,"It's bigger than the London Eye and takes half an hour to rotate.

To be honest it's take a bit too long as you all of Singapore in the first 10-15 minutes. The rest is spent waiting for it to end.

However, book a M枚et suite (champagne, anyone?) and there'll be plenty to occupy you on the ride.",,,
,,Bird Eye View of Singapore,5,,Best place to know the landmarks of Singapore.Roomy Chamber. Better than London Eye.,,,
,,Fantastic views!,4,,"Have taken the London Fly, and this would equal London for the view. Went mid afternoon and dodged the queues. Very enjoyable, and the harbour view was incredible! The gift shop was nothing too exciting, the usual tourist stuff",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"Great views, no queues. A great way to see the Singapore skyline.",,,
,,Worth doing,5,,"The flyer is worth the money, great views of the marina bay sands and is cheaper than actually paying to go up to the marina observation deck. Great views from the flyer of the Formula 1 pit lane and start/finish straight.",,,
,,"A ""flight"" in a capsule with a view",4,,"Launched in 2008, the Singapore Flyer at 165 metres is the world鈥檚 largest observation wheel - a whole 30 metres larger than the London Eye. It has 28 passenger capsules and each revolution takes 30 minutes. The Flyer is housed in a three storey building that also has shops, bars, and restaurants. It operates daily between 8.30am and 10.30pm.

We learn that unlike ferris wheels which have open passenger cradles that are kept balanced by the force of gravity, have limited capacity, with passengers having to maintain the same position throughout the ride, observation wheels in contrast have fixed passenger capsules where people can sit or walk around without feeling any movement or vibration and take in a 360 degree view.

Interesting fact: The Flyer has 28 capsules each measuring 28 square metres and each designed to hold 28 passengers! Apparently, the number 28 is good Feng Shui signifying prosperity 鈥?so in effect, the Flyer is like some giant wheel of Fortune!

Tidbit: We were told that the Flyer which was earlier rotating counter-clockwise when viewed from Marina Centre, had its direction changed to clockwise later as advised by Feng Shui gurus!

Tip 1: Buying the Flyer tickets online gives you a 10% discount - the price per adult at the discounted level works out to SG$ 26.55

Tip 2: The tropical rainforest in the central atrium of the Flyer is cool and extremely rejuvenating 鈥?do spend some time there once you are done with your 鈥渇light鈥?(as the Flyer operators choose to call it) and take some snaps too.

Tip 3: While you do pass through a section called Journey of Dreams before you actually get aboard the Flyer, not all parts of it demand the same level of interest or attention. The Prelude merits just a walk through. The Dreamscape, a concave screen displaying ever changing colourful circular images should not take longer than a few minutes. The Discovery is good for engineering buffs interested in the design aspects of the Flyer. The Fragment of Dreams is fun if you鈥檇 like to explore old Singapore. The peep holes at Dream Journal that showcase Singapore history and heritage are fascinating. Dream Reflections isn鈥檛 too great. In Reservoir of Dreams, the Oneiroi鈥檚 Orb exhibit is intriguing in the way it uses common, everyday circular objects.

Tip 4: Apparently on a good clear day you can see up to 45 kms away from the Flyer 鈥?but don鈥檛 bank on it. Do the Flyer for the experience of riding the world鈥檚 largest observation wheel 鈥?but if you鈥檙e looking for the best 360 degree views of Singapore, the observation deck at Marina Bay Sands definitely seems a much better bet.

Tip 5: Food options at the Flyer: (a) Singapore Food Trail at the Flyer is a good place to get some food - it is retro Singapore dining circa the 1960s. Great ambience, good for some lovely snaps too. (b) However if a snack is all that you're looking for, get that at Ya Kun Kaya Toast on your way out from the Flyer. The food is very reasonably priced, hygienic, served quick and tastes good - what more could one ask for! Both the Singapore Food Trail and Ya Kun are located at Level 1 of the Flyer.

Tip 6: If you鈥檙e looking to really pump up the adrenaline, do the 鈥淪ingapore dream car experience鈥?which has the Flyer as a starting point. You can choose between a red Ferrari F430 F1 Spider or a yellow Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder - they're both convertibles with top speeds of just above 300 km/h 鈥?WOW! You can choose to drive or be driven 鈥?about SG$400 for a 30 minute drive and 20% less than that if you choose to be chauffeured (you can choose between drive durations of 15, 30 or 60 minutes).",,,
,,Wow,4,,"Well worth it and well priced. Great views of an amazing city and its wealth on display with a navy of cargo vessels in the Strait. Went on dusk so saw the transformation from day to night (Singapore is on the equator so night falls very quickly). Arrived from nearest MRT (underground) station, Promenade, and whilst it is hard to miss, it is very difficult to navigate to entrance as there are no signs).",,,
,,Great view,3,,"If your a sucker for a view, then this is for you. It's expensive, which is why I only gave it an average rating. It's good to go on a clear day.",,,
,,good view of singapore,3,,"nice slow ride, on a big round wheel. one gets a nice 360 perspective of singapore",,,
,,Its one of those must do activities,4,,"It was very well organised although I couldn't really be bothered with all the preceding displays, I just wanted to go on the trip. Once you're on the flyer, you can work out how the pods rotate. Our trip was in the late afternoon and by the time we got around, the lights of the city were all on providing a sparkling view. Its a great way to get an idea of the layout of Singapore.",,,
,,I recommend to all,5,,"I really recommed this for everyone visting singapore. A mazing views and you get a great photo as a souvineer. The staff were really polite and helpful and theres lots of shops and cheap food and drink in the buliding too. We were very lucky to get to see an army exibition, so that made it even better.",,,
,,Great Views!,5,,"We went on the Singapore Flyer last month during a 3 night stay at Singapore. We visited on a Saturday afternoon and the queues were small, hardly any wait at all! The views are fantastic. The pods are not overcrowded and there is plenty of space inside to move around and take photos. Would recommend!",,,
,,BO-ORING,1,,"It's slow. It's for geriatrics. Half of the wheel turn shows a decent skyline. the other (descending) shows private apartment blocks facing east. Save this for when you are retired and thrill rides will give you a heart seizure.

Unlike the London Eye, this is not giving you a view of one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world.",,,
,,Excellent to watch,5,,We were going to go on the flyer but as there was a queue decided not to bother as we were limited for time. It is said that it is 100ft higher than the London Eye.,,,
,,Great view of the city,4,,"We went up at dusk and saw the full view and then the lights begin to come on. No queue to get on, but a little hard to find the entrance by foot.",,,
,,Good place to see the night Singapore,4,,"I had been to Singapore Flyer for a few times since it started. From nothing to something, it is now quite a good way to view the city at night. I am lucky that I do not need to pay for the ride, so I feel even worth it.",,,
,,Nice view of waterfront at night,4,,"Used airline discount, otherwise rather pricey for the tickets. The cabin was quite spacious so you can walk around and see the city from various perspectives. Since we went on the ride at night, all we saw were many, many lights :-) The view of the waterfront was quite spectacular.",,,
,,A nice family outing,4,,Its a fun thing to do once or twice - especially for overseas visitors to Singapore,,,
,,Wonderful experience,4,,"We did the Moet Chandon flight twice, at night, and the views are amazing. Probably one of the best ways to experience the city from high above.,",,,
,,Good place to take pictures and relax.,3,,Relaxing 30 minute observation ride. Spectacular view but a bit expensive. TIP: Estimate the queue. Get on board at around 7pm to experience the sunset.,,,
,,Great views of the city.,4,,Good way to get orientated. Expensive but we got vouchers so went for free thanks to our airline.,,,
,,Underwhelming,3,,"Being the world鈥檚 tallest ferris wheel, we were reasonably excited to get on board this. The concept of the area preceding the actual flyer, is similar to the Eiffel tower, where the history of Eiffel tower is discussed along with its mechanics. In a similar manner, before boarding, you will encounter alot of visuals and interactive materials involving the ferris wheel and Singpapore. It was interesting to see visuals of a Singapore long gone juxtaposed with the latest additions to this bustling city.
We then got in line to get into one of the pods, which can hold upto 28 people. Luckily for us, our group had only 15 people, leaving a lot of space to move once we set off. However, that was where it got a little boring. The view while going up is ordinary. Its only when you are at the top that it gets a little exciting with all of Singapore's iconic buildings lit up. At $24, its a little on the pricey side
Overall, its not a big loss if you give it a miss. There is an even higher viewing point at the Marina Bay Sands. However, there is a great hawker style food court at the ground floor offering a variety of food",,,
,,Fantastic Views,3,,Quite expensive and dare I say a bit boring. The views are spectacular but that about it.,,,
,,very good,5,,"Go to Sentosa, this cater for all ages and you will not regret it. So many eating place to choose . I think this is also where Singapore flyer is.",,,
,,Awesome views,4,,From the top u get a panoramic views of the city. Very good during the sunset.,,,
,,Nice place for Singapore' views ;),4,,"I come there on March, 2012. Just only one world to express about Singapore Flyer: AMAZING!
From the cabin, you can see whole Singapore's views. I will highly recommend this place for any couples whom wanna enjoy sunset there as we did before :) Their services are good, they know how to make the guets satisfy with the tickets which they paid!!!",,,
,,Pretty high!,4,,"Great view over the City and surroundings in 360degr. Highest point is amazing to look around from. We bought the City ticket so we could discover many attractions and the Flyer was one of them.

Not comfortable inside, but you are not supposed to be sitting anyways...

We enjoyed, would not do it again, but recommend!",,,
,,Very efficient and great views,4,,Hardly any queue to get on in the evening on a Sunday. Price seems right compared to the London experience (SGD$28 for adults) and on this clear day you could see pretty much for ever. I am not convinced about the 'pre-flight' do-da's to keep you amused in the event of a queue I suppose but you can waltz right by them. Plenty of room in the capsules and truly a 360 degree view. Well worth a trip. I took the trip in the evening where you do get a good view of the sunset behind the city.,,,
,,"Great views, no queues",4,,"Excellent views, took about 40 mins to go around, and not crowded. No queues either. Much better value and experience than the London Eye equivalent.",,,
,,Good views,4,,"We booked online to gain an extra 10% off, and I also took advantage of the reduced price for my mother, who qualified for the 'pensioner' rate, even though she is not a Singapore resident. It is very similar to the London Eye, except it goes higher. Fabulous views of the surrounding area and well worth it.",,,
,,Difficult to forego,4,,if you are only in Singapore for a few days it's hard to pass up the opportunity to see the city this way. No queue on a Monday morning and a very cool ride.,,,
,,Ok at night,3,,went for a ride and found nothing spectacular except for the nightlights around the island. But it does get boring after a while.,,,
,,a must do at singapore,4,,"get your tickets online. exchange vouchers at entry. climb/elevator to first floor where the enrty is. take time to reach the loading point. nice photo ops enroute.

get into a capsule, and enjoy the sights of SIN city for 30 minutes.

if you can pay extra, or are on a honeymoon, go in for the sunset./post sunset dinner deals.",,,
,,Moet & Chandon Champagne Flight,5,,"We were lucky to experience this amazing attraction as a corporate event with a full moet & chandon champagne service flight on sunset. We had an absolute ball with our work colleagues, as you ascend into the sky from the comfort of the glass capsule , bubbles in hand as you savour the stunning Singapore skyline. I adored the elegant tulip flutes that the champagne was served in. A real treat....",,,
,,"OK, but nothing great",3,,"You instantly draw comparisons with the London Eye which I think is better. The Singapore Flyer may be bigger, but the entrance exhibits and feel of a departure lounge is tacky and cheesy. The views were OK but I recommend the adjacent Marina Bay hotel top deck which is higher and you can stay there as long as you like.",,,
,,must see,4,,great tourist spot - can see the whole city - great for photos and hearing about Singapores history,,,
,,Something you have to do once,4,,Great way to see the city and catch the sights. Should definitely do at least once.,,,
,,Better views at Marina Bay Sands,1,,"For a slow moving flyer, it is better to go to Marina Bay Sands and get a much better view of SIngapore",,,
,,Just a one time visit place,3,,"Its exciting at first but after 10minutes,you start to wonder..is it moving?Had to bring lollipops for my kids to keep them still!",,,
,,Fabulous experience,5,,A real must when you are in Singapore. Fantastic views and very well managed. Good value for money as well.,,,
,,Excellent panoramic view,5,,movement of the wheel was at the right pace in order to enjoy the good view of the city,,,
,,Fantastic views,4,,"Gives great views over Singapore. Is really cool, and the 40 minutes you are in there are so amazing",,,
,,Awesome...A must do when you are in Singapore,5,,Singapore Flyer is a different awesome experience. The view from the top of the whole business district is amazing...we were lucky cause our trip coincided with the army day and we were able to watch the show during our singapore flyer ride...You can take the ride during the day and have a nice dinner at the restaurants in the evening,,,
,,Amazing view!,4,,"The flyer was a wonderful experience! There is a fee to go up there and it鈥檚 about 30min ride. Best time to go is at night, you can enjoy the night light. We went relatively late so there were many people, it was actually quite romantic. Going up was awesome but the view as amazing coming back down. I would definitely recommend this to anybody.",,,
,,A Peaceful Quiet Moment in the Air-conditioned Sky,5,,"I've visited the Flyer a couple of times. If you go in the evenings, you can usually have the entire capsule to yourself. Although the capacity is 30, they usually don't pack it to the brim, even in the day, there is always sufficient space for people to walk around and take pictures, or just have a seat, which people usually don't.

The tickets are a little pricey, as with most tourist attractions where ever you go, but a smart Singaporean would wait till there are promotions to visit, like I always do.

The flight is around 30 minutes, which I usually am afraid will be too boring, but somehow time does fly in that small capsule. Because it's glass everywhere, the view is open and you can see the ends of Singapore when you are at the top. I presume it's made of strong glass, so you can take funny pictures like leaning on the glass and acting like you are falling out.

A visit to Singapore Flyer should not just stop there. Since you have already bought the ticket, take some time to visit the gallery along your way in, and the gift shop on your way out. Buy a souvenir pic, I always do when I go abroad. There is a nice little garden on the ground floor, which children will probably like. There are fishes to feed and a tiny waterfall there. There is a variety of food outlets, and a newly-opened local food coffeeshop, which is pricier than the actual local food outside, but a good experience for tourists who want to try local fare.

There are other attractions in the building. There is the Ducktour company, which conducts tours on their Hippo Bus and Duck Vehicle. There is also a flight simulator(if i'm not wrong). So yeah, check out the other stuff around. Some times there also events held by the river outside the Flyer, like the recent Army Fair.

It's the holidays now, so there are some performances and activities going on. The Singapore Flyer is also celebrating their anniversary so each ticket comes with a free bus tour and cruise ride. Well-worth the money. The river cruise was a beautiful experience.

Tip: Buy tickets online to get 10% off!",,,
,,Great views,4,,"If you can't visit the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, then the Singapore Flyer is a good way to get a view of the City. It will also allow you to get some good views of the Marina Bay Sands building itself.
Purchasing a general admission ticket gives you access to the museum before you enter the Flyer, so you can see the history of the area and the making of the wheel. You then get 1 rotation of the wheel, which is good at dusk, so you can appreciate the day and night view on the 30 - 40 min rotation.
However, for a special treat you can do dinner in the Flyer, which gives you multiple rotations and a 3 course meal. Otherwise, cocktails in a special pod could also be exciting (although we didn't do any of these options, but they do look good).",,,
,,Worth a Go,4,,"Nice venue, we had no queuing but it was very well laid out and I think that helps. It was a pleasant 30 mins with no real complaints.",,,
,,nice ariel view,4,,"Beautiful view all around ,30 minutes of journey with 360 degree view of Singapore all around . Marina bay looks awesome from up there.It should not be missed.The day we visited there was some army function at the base camp just below the Flyer with tanks and parades ,it was fun.",,,
,,Best at sundown/twighlight,4,,"The singaporeans love telling the Brits that the flyer is bigger than the eye - but thats missing the point i guess. Its the city that makes the wheel. And singapore is damn pretty, sea, harbour lush greens and a skyline to match. Prettier then London??? But then i am very very biased",,,
,,Nice experience!,4,,Amazing view of Singapore and very well maintained flyer! It is really a good thing to do in Singapore and I would recommend to everybody!,,,
,,Flying high,3,,LIKE: beautiful view! specially during sunset.... DISLIKE: food not allowed???? picnic in the air is nice...,,,
,,Great View,4,,We went early in the morning with no line. The service was great and only 4 people all together in our capsule. The Flyer have amazing views over the area and we got to see the preparations for a concert.,,,
,,a must see,5,,I enjoyed looking at Singapore from different aspects and there were many contrasts between the old and the modern - for instance old boats on the water as contrasted with the Marina Bay buildings. It takes 30 minutes and is wonderfully slow.,,,
,,heights and view,4,,Nice one to try and view Singapore via wheel. Will test your braveness if you are afraid of heights .....,,,
,,"""Boring""",2,,The place where Singapore Flyer is located is fantastic but the ride itself is too boring..,,,
,,Getting around Singapor,4,,If you fly Singapore airlines you get a discount a good way to get to attractions.,,,
,,Well worth it.,4,,"We went to the Flyer in the morning, but it was closed as there was a threat of lightening. We returned in the afternoon, which was great as it was far less crowded. We were in a pod with only 4 other people. Amazing 360 degree views, with photo opportunities from every angle. A definite must for anyone visiting Singapore.",,,
,,"Wowee, singapore even more beautiful from up here",5,,Great way to see Singapore and how Singapore is constantly changing. We did 6.30pm Singapore sling promotion - great time as sun was setting and lights were coming on. Great value for money - surprised we didnt need to queue ...,,,
,,Every City's Better from Above!,4,,"I had a free pass to this attraction due to a stopover deal. That being said, I'd have paid for it for sure, it's great! The staff was aware that I was on my own between a 2 big groups of non-English speakers so they made sure I was not in a pod with them.",,,
,,Not to miss.... The flyer is the tallest and gives a panoramic view of the city.,5,,The flyer I believe is the tallest ferris wheel in the world and gives a awesome panoramic view of the entire city.,,,
,,amazing view,4,,"If you have not been to singapore before I think its a must do , it would suit all travellers from singles through to families .the view was great it was amazing to see just how many tankers are lined up all the way out to sea! The wheel turns slowly so that photos of the entire area is possible.it took about half an hour for the full rotation. weel worth the visit",,,
,,165m high,5,,"Even taller than the London Eye, gives great views over Singapore! We took the trip around sunset, so got some great photos of the city! If you do the open-top bus tour, you will get a discount on your Flyer tickets!",,,
,,One time see in singapore- prefer 6pm slot,4,,"My husband and I visited the singapore flyer two weeks back. We booked tickets thru' isango.com
We did not have to stand in a line. We directly went to our reservation counter number and showed him a copy of our reservation.
Each box allows 15'ish people.
There is also a dining experience which is 90-120minutes. but we took the regular 30 min ride.
I would recommend taking 6 or 6.30PM slot as you can see sun set and night view of the entire singapore city.
P.S: food not allowed inside. Not sure if it has Wheelchair access or strollers. Check their official website for more queries.",,,
,,A must do for Singapore,4,,"Rode this once during the day on one of our trips then again at night. Its definitely a great experience and provides you plenty of opportunity to see the entire city from up high. Get the best of both worlds by going just before sunset so you can see the entire city and watch it light up. The ride is quite long, about 30mins+. They have dinner gondolas at night but the price is a bit steep. Might be a good place to propose (only if you're sure she'll say yes)",,,
,,A Bird's Eye View,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is the tallest ferris wheel in the world. It moves so slowly that you don't even realize that it is moving most of the time. The view is spectacular and you're as high up as the Marina Bay Sands. We were lucky that it wasn't busy and there were only 6 of us in the ""pod"" so we could easily move around.",,,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,Well worth a visit. Very interesting. We were lucky enough to have a pod to ourselves and the views are outstanding. Gives you a wonderful idea of how massive the place is. The staff were lovely and helpful. You have your photo taken before getting on and even that was a bit of fun because the staff are just so lovely and happy. Very glad we took the time to do this.,,,
,,Best view of the city,5,,"looks scary at first, but once you're inside, you'll never feel the height and the movement, you'll enjoy the sight and the comfort",,,
,,spetacular view,4,,worth the experience. The coulors and lights of the modern city followed by fireworks makes this outing a definite plus,,,
,,Room with a view,5,,"This was great as it travells slowly so passengers can get a good view of all the outlying areas, it is well maintained and very worth while to do.",,,
,,Bird's eye view of Singapore,5,,"This slow moving Ferris Wheel ride can be rented for special occasions. It can be spruced up for weddings, prom, anniversaries so you can celebrate in style. Each car is airconditioned and moves very slowly so you can enjoy the view from the top. You can also ride it during ordinary days and marvel at the sights.",,,
,,The Singapore Eye!,5,,"Located strategically near the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the Singapore Flyer offers stunning views of the Marina Bay, Barrage and the downtown Singapore with its towering scrapers. As informed the flyer is 35 meters taller than the London eye, but in my opinion offers a better view of the ocean, the city, rivers and buzzing areas, all in one.

This is one ferris wheel you do not want to miss.",,,
,,As expected,4,,Had a pleasant experience on the flyer. Great views and comfortable ride,,,
,,So great view,5,,"This is a great way to have a nice city view . Is really cool, and the 40 minutes you are in there are so amazing! We went there by the afternoon before 6pm and was not crowded at all.",,,
,,Like the london Eye,4,,This is a bigger version of the London eye which gives good views over Singapore to Malaysia & Indonesia. We also went in the evening but timed it slightly wrong to see the city lit up. Aim for about 7pm to see this properly.,,,
,,What a surprise!,5,,"I booked this on line before leaving Australia as just 'something to do' while on a short stay in Singapore and to be honest was not really expecting much. I booked the 'Singapore Sling' package during the happy hour time which means we enjoyed a buy one get one free situation halving the standard cost, the downside of this is that you are booked into an exact date and time and there are more limited time slots to choose. On arrival we were ushered into the guest lounge and were escorted through to our pod. We were (no doubt) extremely lucky to have a flashy pod all to ourselves the Moet one!)which was such a bonus. I can see others here experienced long queues but this was not our experience at all and we were straight on. the cocktail was very refreshing during the ride and all in all a great experience.",,,
,,It's beautiful!!,4,,We love there and have taken some fun photos!! This is one of my favorite spot that must go when I was in Singapore.,,,
,,Can see the whole city in the capsule,5,,Absolutely a must whether you are a tourist or local. I went there 3 times and see different things every time i go,,,
,,A Photographers' Delight,5,,We visited the flyer to get a birds' eye view of Singapore...Its an absoluted delight for the photographer Also was amazed with the lesser wait times.,,,
,,Wow what a view.,5,,Brilliant even though it was an overcast day what an amazing view. Well worth it and if you book online you can get a cruise and bus trip as well.,,,
,,Great flight ;-),5,,"Fantastic view
Night flight was amazing - lasted about 30 mins
I booked online before our stay in singapore for a discounted rate. You also get discount with singapore air boarding card.
lovely photo opportunities
no queues!
Definately worth doing for a great view of SIngapore",,,
,,Singapore Flyer is better at night,4,,"I've been on the Flyer previously during daytime and recently I went again at night. Personally I find that the views are more spectacular at night. One thing to note is that because of the light reflections on the glass capsule, taking pictures would be a little more difficult at night than during the day. A good way to enjoy the views of the Marina Bay area in air conditioned comfort and a place to sit (as compared to the Sky Park at MBS). Check the website for promotions and discounts as I find that the full price of $29.50 per adult is rather steep.",,,
,,View from the top!,5,,"The Flyer is a magnificent work of construction. The pods are the size of buses & can easily carry 10 or more people at a time. The height is incredible & you can see all of Singapore from the top! The views are not to be missed in the day or the night. Spend some money & book a dinner on the flyer, you wont be disappointed!",,,
,,Is it really worth it?????,1,,"U are rushed into a capsule which takes u to a height and gets u back in about an hour.....
The view is the same that you have seen from the observatory deck in the Marina Bay Sands.......
This is just a marketing tool to fool tourists.
Please don't fall for it. Total Waste of money",,,
,,Wonderful views,5,,"This is similar to London Eye....only they don't pack you into a pod so tightly. Had the luxury of a pod to ourselves. Views are amazing, and get to see the view of the marin bay from up high too.",,,
,,Bird Eye View of the Harbour & Marina,4,,The best time to visit is in the evening ; just before sunset. You can view the sky change from a golden glow to bright dazzle of lights as the marina area lights up.,,,
,,Perfect overlooking city spot,4,,nice experience...best way to capture Sg during nighttime,,,
,,You can see the city that you can not see from the ground!,4,,"You can go there by Metro, You can see the city, the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the ship at the top this hotel . There is a cabin for wedding celebration!. If you are ready, do not miss it!. Congralation!.",,,
,,A great nightime experience,5,,A wonderful view best experienced at night to appreciate the Singapore skyline. family friendly with a variety of shops and eating places and a short walk to Marina Bay.,,,
,,good,4,,"was good, if you have a singapore airlines boarding pass, use it as you get a discount",,,
,,Worth doing,4,,"We have done both the London eye and the Singapore flyer in the last week. Very similar. The Singapore flyer moves slightly faster and doesn't have the touch screens in the pods that can be used to identify some of the landmarks around the city. This would have been handy since we don't know Singapore that well. Otherwise, it was still worth doing, giving us views of the city. Short wait lines. Discounted entry if you present a Singapore Airlines boarding pass. We got to it via the hop on hop off bus.",,,
,,Another impressive structure,5,,Confusing to find where to pay and where to go so had a few frustrating trips backwards and forwards to get tickets. Great trip takes about 30 mins to go round and you dont even feel the capsule moving. Excellent views,,,
,,singapore flyer,5,,spectacular views of singapore and beyond well worth doing the area aroung the flyer is also worth a look,,,
,,As expected,4,,"Overpriced for what it is, but you simply have to do it. I would recommend a drink on top of the Sands Hotel Bar and look down at the Flyer. The view is more impressive from this higher location",,,
,,"鈥淏eautiful, you must-see鈥?,5.0,,The Singapore Flyer's a real surprise. I visited there during my first visit to Singapore.The Flyer is definitely worth the money and a visit to experience a ride on the largest wheel in the world is a must.",,,,,,
This Flyer offers unprecedented views of the Singapore skyline," and also parts of Indonesia and Malaysia.""",,,,,,,
,,A breathtaking 30min ride,3,,The flyer is closed to the Marina Sands and if you were staying at the Sands then you could just walk over. Sometimes the wait to get into the flyer could be long so be prepared. We were lucky to step into one after a wait of 10-15mins. Each box is quite huge to accomodate 15-20 people so it has a good capacity to keep the crowd moving. Once in the flyer standing at the edge and watching the ground get farther n farther is really amazing. Once at the top you get a view of the entire city.,,,
,,Pleasant enough experience,3,,"...Singapore is not really a great city to view from the Flyer. Glad we had complementary tickets and did not have to pay full fare. Spacious, clean, comfortable and stable pods.",,,
,,Worth every penny,5,,Fantastic ride and amazing view at a very reasonable price. Kids love it.,,,
,,good for S'pore overview,4,,I took the flyer with my family for the bird-eye view of the city. you will get to see a very nice view of Singapore. its about 30 mins round. the compartments can cary about 20 people but we were lucky to be in one alone. you can spend the time looking around and compaire the maps they provide inside with what you see out and decide to visit after the 30 mins are over.,,,
,,A peaceful half hour,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is a bigger edition of the London Eye. It takes half an hour to complete a circuit. It is above the F1 race track so you get a bird's eye view of the track and what I presume are the pits. There are some lovely buildings all around and you get a fantastic view of the city.
There were only 8 of us in the gondola and we all ended up chatting. All different nationalities.
There is seating but most people stand looking out of the windows.",,,
,,Awesome Flyer view,4,,"Great view of Singapore and surrounding countires! Photos don't work that well at night due to the light reflection inside the cabins. Howeverr, the live view of the city lights at night is beautiful. It's worth doing.",,,
,,Slower than you think,3,,It moves so slowly you will fall asleep. Enjoy the view and hopefully there are no noisy children in the same car. Best time to go probably during sunset or formula1 season!,,,
,,a lifetime experience!!!!!,4,,perfect to see singapore skyline in half an hour. great experience....u can see whole of singapore in one go...kids loved it!!!!!!! decent cabin size of flyer makes it a very comfortable ride....the picture works photographs of you are a must buy memoir for every visitor...,,,
,,Better than Sands Skypark,5,,"Price is 30 $SGD and it takes 30 min to make a complete round. Cabin is verty confortble, with A/C, and backgound music. I visit it at night and is really wonderfull. Much better that Sands Skypark.",,,
,,wonderful views,4,,I was skeptical about going on the flyer but it was a lovely experience. My young son also loved it and we got some great views.,,,
,,Lame,5,,Being stuck for 40 minutes in a slow moving capsule that doesn't go as. High as most of the buildings around it? No thanks.,,,
,,"beautiful view 360 degree,specially when U go by the sunset!!!",5,,"we were quing a little bit, and get in to the capsule with aprox.20 other person. everybody was keen on to take lots of pics, but it was'nt a problem, there are plenty of space for everyone:) the view is just spectacular can't stop watching it:) in a sunny day it is a must to try!!!!",,,
,,Flyer,4,,"Didn't go on it, as we were going to the viewing platform on top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, and that was taller. But it is very much like the London Eye, with excellent views over Singapore and the harbour",,,
,,Heaven on Flyer,5,,We are lucky booking on line for our SG flyer ride. We availed of the tourist special package which cost us only 50% of the regular price for a VIP themed capsule with a Singapore sling cocktail. Book a night ride to view Singapore by night. I strongly recommend to visit its website for promos and book on line to avoid the long queue.,,,
,,Look for special offers in the local tourist maps,5,,This is a great way to view the city an the F1 track. We discovered plenty of special deals for tourists in the local tourist maps. We paid $60 each for a VIP capsule with a Singapore Sling cocktail.,,,
,,"Just Big, nothing special!",3,,"There was little on he ground to recognize from above unlike the ""Eye"" in London. It was just a little higher Ferris Wheel.

Despite the fact that the senior discount was denied us foreign vistors, we went up in the ""Flyer"" anyway, but this attitude left us somewhat with a sour taste in our mouth.",,,
,,A must-see tourist attraction,4,,Don't need to describe this - it's in all the tourist brochures. It is worth doing and the view is good - yes the Marina Sands hotel is higher but the flyer has an ever changing view in comfortable conditions. There is a good discount for booking online and also a discount for seniors. We did not have to queue at all. The actual approach to the flyer is through a rather gaudy sort of arcade - not very pleasant. You have to take a chance with the weather - sometimes it is really hazy. Best time is after a storm.,,,
,,Great views!!,5,,Best on a clear day. Roomy cars. Not a long line to enter,,,
,,"Great way to see S'pore, especially if a first-time visitor",5,,"The Singapore Flyer, despite is somewhat steep ticket price, is worth a ride. Avoid the fancy stuff (dinner in the sky etc, unless you are a honeymooning couple in love only with each other and not with money!), go for the basic ride. Do carry a camera along. I would suggest takinga ride in the late afternoon -- that way you get to see Singapore (and even Sentosa, Marina Bay) in daylight and dusk/nightime! The full circle ride takes 30 mins. Be wary of the chaps who click your pictures as you step into the Flyer cars -- those pic cost $30 or more ach if you choose to buy one. You will be better off using your own camera unless you would like a souvenir (those professional photographs do a good job of that).",,,
,,Excellent views from the flyer,5,,"Do not miss the Singapore flyer. We went there around 6 pm when it was not fully dark yet. From what people said, you can see as far as Indonesia and Malaysia on a clear day. The whole ride takes about 30 to 40 minutes and you are sitting in an air conditioned capsule and enjoying the views that it has to offer. This is a must do activity. It moves so slowly that you don't feel that it is moving at all. Definitely worth the experience.",,,
,,Great view of Singapore.,4,,"If you want to see all of Singapore and take plenty of pictures of the city from a-high then take a ride on the Singapore Flyer. You'll pay just under $30.00 Singapore Dollars for the experience, but it's well worth the price tag. I went on the Flyer on the 07th of May 2012 and really enjoyed the experience. You get half an hour for your money, but the flyer moves very slowly so you've got loads of time to take pictures of every part of Singapore with time to spare. Word of warning though, Singapore's weather is very erratic so the flyer can be closed if the weather is too bad, rain, thunder & lightning storms a regular occurrences in Singapore.",,,
,,Best view,5,,What an experience. You get a great view of the city. Pitty that it was a hazey day,,,
,,Great Views,5,,if its not cloudy and raining go for the 37min round trip,,,
,,A good way to see singapore from above,3,,"We did the flyer on the back of a half day city tour through viator and it was a good way to end the tour!
If you've been on the London eye, you'll know exactly what to expect - its very slow moving but the glass 'cabins' offer great views of the city and beyond. Its good if your short on time in singapore and great for photo opportunities.
we also had a fab lunch in the food court at the flyer - this was the absolute highlight for us!",,,
,,Nice,4,,Enjoyable! If you go during day time you can see more of Singapore!,,,
,,Great way to see the city,5,,"Too bad it was so smoggy the day we went, but this was a great way to see this amazing city. There are neat interactive and modern displays on the way to the ""ride"". The kids (3 and 6) liked the displays, but got a little bored on the way around the huge wheel. For the price, I might leave them on the ground next time. ;)",,,
,,Amazing,5,,This is great. Amazing views and Amazing pictures. Its a must if visiting Sinagpore,,,
,,Short on time and want to see Singapore,5,,"This is really the easiest and most convenient way to see Singapore, expecially if you are short on time. If you are in Singapore for a few days, it's a great way to get orientated to the city",,,
,,Great for city photos,4,,"If this is the only place you're going to visit to get great photos then you wont be disappointed. One revolution takes approx 20-25minutes, cost SGD26 per person. Food stalls are available for pre/post ride dining. No commentary on board, just viewing pleasure. You can easily walk between Marina Sands complex and the flyer in several minutes via a foot bridge.",,,
,,FLY...FLY...FLY,5,,"Your journey won't be completed if you miss this flyer. You can see the whole Singapore in a sec just sit down and enjoy the view from the top. You can also have the romantic dinner here.
TIPS: Pre-booking for about 1 week from the day you want to have the ""SPECIAL MOMENT""",,,
,,Get the combo Flyer and Hippo for $28,4,,"You can purchase a combo tix. You have to do the Flyer before 6P but that is ok. The Flyer location also hosts a food court that has a nice throw back feel of old Singapore. The food there is pretty phenomenal. On a weekday, the flyer was pleasantly uncrowded. We enjoyed our time there. Good views.",,,
,,Amazing view,4,,"Went there in the evening...beautiful sunset view, and you can see colorful lights from Marina Bay's building structure. It's a huge Ferris Wheel, what can I say more! Nice for a romantic evening if you didn't share the same 'flight' with numbers of person, it would be great for a quiet beautiful moment.",,,
,,A must do but a little expensive.!,5,,Can't miss this when in Singapore. Amazing views. Smooth easy ride to see the sights over the beautiful city. Little bit over priced - but worth paying.!,,,
,,Boring,3,,Too dragging!!! Too slow... not really amazing view....,,,
,,Singapore flyer sky- land- sea adventure,4,,"We were invited to this last weekend. This is a value package consisting of the singapore flyer, an open deck bus ride and a river cruise. IMHO , it's value for money as the cost is equivalent to an ordinary ticket, it last from may to June only for the shook holidays. We were given 2 free tickets but had to pay for others on the ride. Overall it's good for tourists with kids. The views from the flyer is fantastic. Check out more at www.thewackyduo.com",,,
,,Best view in Singapore,5,,"If you did not know this this is the biggest construction of its kind, bigger then the London Eye. Views are great but recommend the sunset time as the experience and the city colors are just perfect for photography!
If you get hungry just below there is a great food court. From here you can just walk to the Helix bridge and Marina Bay sands.
A definite stop when travelling in Singapore.",,,
,,Amazing view of the bay!,4,,Definitely worth your time for a fantastic view of the bay and City of Singapore!,,,
,,Amazing view of the bay!,4,,Definitely worth your time. The views of the bay and City of Singapore are fantastic!,,,
,,Flyer,4,,"A must see when you visit Singapore. Take the 2 day tripper pass for SGD 169 from Luxury Travels and you can visit the Flyer and many other sights including Sentosa. With the tripper pass, you can travel on the Hippo Tours and use that to reach the flyer. Good view from the flyer. Time taken - Half hour.",,,
,,a great way to see the architecture of the city,4,,very well-organized and site development is interesting. spectacular views of the city.,,,
,,Great Experience and worth the money.,5,,"The flyer is a unique experience in itself. Its a slow ride for 40 minutes and takes you through the scenic views of Singapore. Our guide had instructed us to take the 6.45 pm to 7.15 pm slot for the ride and it definitely proved very worthwhile. You get to watch the skyline, beautifully lit dock and the city as well as a mesmerizing sunset.",,,
,,Unexpected,5,,We had not intended taking a trip on the flyer. It seemed a little ho-hum. We were however blown away by the ride and the service along the way. We would fully recommend this as a must do when in Singapore. It was great and beautiful to see the city scape from the pods.,,,
,,Great Views.,5,,You get some for the best vies of the city and marina from up there. You get to spend a lot of time high above the city and the pods are large enough to walk around and get great pictures. If possible try and get a pod with few children as the revolution around can get a bit loud as the children are enjoying themselves.,,,
,,A must do when in Singapore,5,,"The Singapore Flyer is simply one of the easiest and most accessible ""must do"" in Singapore. There might be a line to get in but the system is very efficiently set up - come on, we are in Singapore! - so it will be no hassle. While you are entering, you have the opportunity to take a photo of yourself which you can pick up after the trip. There are also plenty of souvenir opportunities. This is something for everyone, from the youngest to the oldest ones, you will feel some vertigo, but it moves so slowly and everything is so safe that you will not be afraid. And you will see the whole Singapore! :)",,,
,,great views a night,4,,"the ride can be kind of boring in the beginning, but otherwise the view is spectacular",,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,"I am terrified of heights but being in a capsule, i felt safe and the views are spectacular. The Flyer is definitely worth the money and a visit to experience a ride on the largest wheel in the world is a must.",,,
,,Hmmm,3,,"Heights not my thing, went because my kids wanted to. My preference would have been to go up the Marina Sands hotel for views. A pleasant enough half hour looking at vast views.",,,
,,Lots of fun,4,,Lots of fun with stunning views over Singapore. We booked on line it was very easy. A must do!,,,
,,"Great view during daytime, never try after dark yet",4,,"nice view on the city, even though the view is greater from the Marina Bay Sands hotel !",,,
,,Night view is best,5,,"I recommend doing Marina Bay skypark during the day and Singapore Flyer at night. Amazing view, meet all expectations",,,
,,wonderful way to see the city,5,,"the building is based in feng shui,so it will bring you wealth and lucky! I hope so! It's really amazing and safe! have fun!",,,
,,Just a view of the city.,3,,Nothing much to do and feel than take pictures. Kinda boring....,,,
,,"Great views, Great Experience",5,,"It was a seamless process getting into our little pod, they offered maps and an audio guide and pictures. Obviously the view gets better as you climb higher. Better experience than the Sky Park. Also received red paper money envelopes! Great warm welcoming atmosphere!",,,
,,Soar above Singapore in a capsule,5,,"The singapore Flyer offers unprecedented views of the Singapore skyline, and also parts of Indonesia and Malaysia.
It is an amazing experience to soar above the ground in a glass capsule and take in the sights.
It's best to go at dusk, just before sunset as you can commence when there is still daylight and conclude as the city lights come on and illuminate the night sky.
It takes about 30 minutes for a single trip.
Why not dine at the lounge or take an hour long flights experience before you go - located in the same precinct along Raffles Avenue. You'll take the controls of a jet liner with an experienced pilot!",,,
,,What a view,5,,Brilliant and got Pensdioners discount as well as Singapore Airlines disc!,,,
,,Best Ferries Wheel,4,,"Its the highest biggest and in my opinion the one that gives the best view. The city, Marina Bay Sands, sea and the Grand Prix circuit is right in front of or just below you. A must see when you are in Singapore.",,,
,,Raise your sights,4,,"Definitely worth doing - I love having the birds-eye view of a city, and Singapore has so much to capture the attention. Even the machinery of the Flyer is impressive & photogenic !

Good to note that there is a good range of eateries & food options on the premises, with a particularly excellent juice bar by the escalator which was most welcome in the heat of the day.

Another review where more pics would be superfluous, so I'll keep mine to myself (鈼曗€库棔鉁?",,,
,,Not to be missed!,5,,"Didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised! The Singapore Flyer is the world's largest observation wheel. You can see for miles! The capsules are large enough to hold 15 to 20 people but we were fortunate enough to share our capsule with a total of eight , which gives you plenty of room to move around and check out all the views. The cost is $69 Sing dollars, which includes a Sinapore Sling drink, the 30 minute ride and then you have the opportunity to check out the museum full of facts on the flyer. There are certain times when they offer two for one deals. Also in the area of the flyer is the Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino, which is an artwork in itself. Hotels in the area are Ritz Carlton, Pan Pacific, Mandarin Oriental and the Fullerton- probably more but those are the ones I saw. There is gift shopping and food available in the building housing the entrance to the flyer, also a mall a few blocks from it.",,,
,,World Largest Wheel,3,,"It is huge and I always went during night time. Haven have a chance to take it during day time. However, I think night time will be great as you can view the night light of Marina Bay Sands, the Esplanade, the river, and the city.

I would think it will be even better if the Garden By the Bay is ready and you can see Singapore under your feet.

For a 30mins ride costed $29.90 which is a bit expensive to me but I am lucky enough to get the corporate pass to allow me to ride it for free.",,,
,,Take the load of your feet,5,,"Found this a great chance to sit back,take a rest,and just enjoy the view",,,
,,Fantastic Experience,5,,"You simply can't go to Singapore and miss this experience! Despite it being a little costly it's worth the money. This is the biggest Ferris Wheel in the world and it makes the London Eye pale into insignificance, by comparison - a penny to a 50p.",,,
,,Beautiful Views,5,,"We experienced the Singapore Flyer this morning and had a lovely time. We went at about
10:30am and there weren't too many people which made it a lovely experience. The weather was perfect with clear blue skies and the views were really well worth seeing.
The pods are air conditioned and were not at all crowded. There were about 10 people which made it very easy to move about and see the views from all angles.
As mentioned by a previous reviewer some of the glass panels were smeared which did ruin a couple of the photos, but a small criticism as I took so many photos that most weren't affected.
I would definitely recommend that visitors to Singapore go on the flyer as the views are brilliant and it is well worth the money.",,,
,,Great Views,5,,"Very clean, great views, a must do, however I did find it odd that there wasn't a map of things to lookout for (unless I missed it) or any audio.",,,
,,This thing is huge!,5,,"I was there at night time, the view is breath taking.",,,
,,fantastic wiew.,5,,"exicting, and wonderful wiew over singapore, absolute a thing to ride.",,,
,,Ignore the negativity!,4,,"Many people in Singapore don't recommend going on the Singapore Flyer, ignore them! I personally had a brilliant time. The views from the wheel are incredible, and on a clear day you can see very far. Yes, the view of Marina Bay Sands is not amazing, but the Central Business District skyscrapers looked brilliant and so did Marina Bay and the Esplanade in general. Once the Gardens by the Bay are completed, they will further enhance the view.
The wheel capsules were comfortable and spacious, and they did not ram them with people. However I felt let down that the windows were quite dirty which meant that from some places photos were not ideal; furthermore there were no images or signs to name and point out the things you could see, like there is in the London Eye. I also thought the time it took to do a rotation was very long, and the wheel could move a bit faster.
However overall this was a brilliant experience, and you get a totally different yet still amazing view of the Singapore skyline from within your capsule. I would definitely recommend it for everyone.
(The nearest MRT is Promenade on the Circle Line).

,,Simply Spectacular,5,,Very beautiful scenes from the top..can see the whole of singapore from here..,,,
,,Flyer experience,4,,Not to be missed. Well organised. Weren't crammed into capsules which was good. Good selection of dining facilities . Walk over bridge to marina bay sands takes ten minutes.,,,
,,Great View,4,,It would be better if it had a commentary. A bit pricey too but the view is really good.,,,
,,Singapore Flyer,5,,Great activity - very well priced and gives an amazing view of Singapore. Go early and avoid the lines - we were a family of four and had a pod to ourselves,,,
,,Flying High,5,,Great bird-eye views over the city ... just perfect for the camera-buffs!!,,,
,,Huge Wheels,5,,Huge wheels and nice scenery when you are on top of the wheel. Worth the money to visit.,,,
,,What a view,5,,"Brilliant a must to do while in Singapore, Try to get in ur own capsual as no doubt u will probably get screaming kids depends on the time i guess.",,,
,,A must-do in Singapore,5,,World's largest Ferris wheel. The capsules are large with a central bench to sit on or area to stand. It slowly goes around one time. Fabulous view of everything!,,,
,,Well worth a visit on a clear day,5,,We had two days in Singapore and the first one was very wet & grey but thankfully it cleared up on the second one. I'd been on the London Eye and it's similar in its construction and operation so felt very safe and sturdy with tremendous views all around & particularly out to sea. It would've been good to have avoided a pod with a noisy child but difficult to choose one with specific people unless you were to go with a crowd of friends. Well worth a trip.,,,
,,The best way to see Singapore,5,,Great attraction and a stunning view of Singapore very effecient with hardly any waiting time [unlike the London Eye]. Well worth the money best at dusk to get the most amazing sunset.,,,
,,It was just okay,3,,"The Singapore flyer experience is overall just okay for me and my friend. I have been on the London flyer and found the view to be much more amazing. I guess the time we went was during the day and the sun was so piercing and hot, it didn't make the experience to be in the capsule to be any pleasant at all. It was rather hot and stuffy. Perhaps if we have gone at night, the night view would have been more amazing and less hot.",,,
,,WOW!,5,,This is a great experience with some wonderful views. Not to be missed!,,,
,,Views,4,,Gets you orientated if you didn't see the view when you flew in. Go on a nice day and before the tourist buses-early when it opens and you might have a car to yourself,,,
,,Good view of the city,4,,We were amazed at this fantastic destination. We took the ride at dusk and we had a great look at the city and its surroundings. The cost of it was slightly steep I thought but its something you would likely do once only.,,,
,,"A must do, but more like the ""Singapore Walker""!!!",5,,Great views from the gondolas as you rise to 200 metres. Very slow as far as Ferris Wheels go but well worth the price of about $30.00 for about a half hour ride.,,,
,,Expensive,3,,"Expensive for what you get! Nice view but overall nothing to rave about. Not as good as the London Eye, but the Flyer gives you a good overall view of Singapore skyline and the harbour area.",,,
,,Better than the London Eye,5,,"Cheaper,better view..no queueing..clean..easy to get to..other things to do on that site as well..",,,
,,Soooo Cool!,5,,"We loved this ferris wheel! 300 feet tall, 30 minute ride with breathtaking views of the city. We got a coupon from our hotel which gave our group of 8 a substantial discount, our own private car, and Singapore Slings all around! Very worthwhile.",,,
,,Great way to see the skyline and marina area,4,,The view from the glass gondolas is magnificent. Watch the weather carefully as I'm sure that it can get hazy at the top on many day.s,,,
,,No head for heights - no worries!,5,,Even I who am scared in a lift enjoyed the Singapore Flyer. The construction appeared extremely strong - I had no worries and the views were amazing.,,,
,,Not as good as the London Eye!,4,,"A good way to spend an hour or so; for a while you are underground and can't see much, and the best views are from the top. Good views of the ships out at sea, the Marina Bay is very beautiful, too. Well run and comfortable, but lacks the iconic views and landmarks of London!",,,
,,Awesome Views,4,,Went in the afternoon - wonderful views. Definitely worth a visit!,,,
,,30 min 30 sgd,2,,If ur a hyper it's not yr thing. N the view from there is not that great. Better to rooftop bar to get a better view.,,,
,,Awesome view!,5,,"See if you can get a pod with whom you want, not a family with kids not shutting up. VERY appreciative approximately 7pm. Don't forget your tripod :D",,,
,,The Best!!,5,,A magnificent attraction that must not be missed. Extremely well run and organised. One of the best attractions I've experienced world wide.,,,
,,Amazing view,4,,"The view from the cabin is amazing: Since the cabin is made from glas (or plastic, whatever) you have a real 360 degree view of the city. And it is really high - it's supposed to be the highest ferris wheel in the world. I am a little afraid of hights, but I felt ok and safe in the cabin. The view on Marina Bay is excellent. Try to get in on a sunny day since the view will be much better. The price is relatively high though (30SGD), but its worth the money.",,,
,,high up,5,,"we loved our whole trip,It was a sunny day when we went so we had superb views of Singapore.",,,
,,Excellent Value,5,,We were travelling with a group of 14 people and chose to do this trip at night time to benefit from the city lights and it was fantastic. We had a capsule to ourselves and for 30 minutes were mesmerised by the views. Great value for money and something not to be missed.,,,
,,A must try when in singapore,5,,Spacious cabin takes you up to see the city state. Buy the vip pass to avoid long ques,,,
,,splendid view,5,,"we visited it in early evening time however were initially disappointed upon being told that it was temporarily not working due to bad weather! we waited for sometime and meanwhile got excellent snaps of the evening look of the marina bay and the sands hotel. we were delighted when they resumed service after almost an hour and managed to get in the first cabin after service started. and wow! what a view! i think the time we visited that is just before complete nightfall at around 6:30 to 7 pm is the best time to be on the flyer. the cabin is spacious and provides ample space and time for everybody to enjoy the view. Singapore shines like a jewel at night as seen from the flyer. the total time on the flyer was 30 minutes during which it slowly takes only one complete revolution. Besides views of the city, flyovers and distant lands we could view the marina sands hotel and bay as well as the merlion from exquisite angles. I think its worth the money - SGD 29.5. I think its better than paying for getting to the roof of the marina bay sands hotel which boasts of similar views. I loved watching the traffic move on the flyovers at night time from atop the flyer. Head to marina bay after the flyer experience at night time to view the laser show at 8:00 and 9:30 pm opposite the marina bay sands hotel.",,,
,,New place to visit at night,3,,Night view is good but I do not know why they build this type of toy in the city... there are many other places to enjoy night view in Sg,,,
,,I believe I can fly,5,,"You will see all Singapore from here, really romantic place should go",,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,"if you are short of time or it is too hot to go around, this is the best way to see singapore. felt safe (and I am afraid of heights!!). after that it is pleasant walk to merlion square continuing to clarke quay.",,,
,,Wow!,5,,Got me over my fear of heights! Worthwhile for the experience and view. Definitely must go again!,,,
,,SEE SINGAPORE FROM THE GIANT FERRIS WHEEL,5,,The views are awesome. A big WOW!!!! This was an exact copy of the London Eye. We went both in the day time and also at night. The night view with the city lights was super.,,,
,,Views!,4,,"Well worth the money for a great experience and fabulous views. Our ride was incorporated within a ""Singapore by night"" tour with dinner at an Indian restaurant - fab food, fab nite!",,,
,,Definitely worth a trip.,5,,"2 adults and 4 small excited girls. One big thunder storm. One non-working Flyer. Not a problem! Tickets are 100% refundable if the Flyer is unable to operate again that day but we decided to hang around and see what happened. The children (aged between 3 and 9) had a blast running around in the gardens beneath the wheel. We fed fish, we ate char siu bau and popiah in the 1960's style hawker centre. We wandered around the balconies and peered at the grand prix track. 90 minutes actually passed very quickly.

As soon as the Flyer re-opened we hopped on. The maps are great but an audio track of what you could see and a bit of history wouldn't have gone amiss but this is a very minor grumble.

If you are in Singapore, you must do this!",,,
,,A bird's eye view of some areas of Singapore especially good for visitors who are there for the first time.,3,,It was a rather complicated process getting the tickets to fly and it was very disappointing after being on the London Eye where you can see so far and all the wonderful London landmarks.,,,
,,Great views of singapore,4,,"terrifying if like me you are afraid of heights..fantastic views, fair price cant fault it really.",,,
,,A bigger London Eye!,4,,"A bigger London Eye that give you great views of Singapore. The capsule is air conditioned (albeit a little too cold for my partner!) and we were lucky to get the capsule to ourselves

Nice way to see Singapore and take some wonderful photos at the same time.",,,
,,Great views,4,,Could do with a commentary. Very efficient ticketing and queuing system.,,,
,,Wonderful view of the whole city,4,,"I haven't yet been able to go on the London Eye and hence cant compare the two. However, I had a wonderful experience on the Singapore Flyer. I went up at night and the whole city was dazzling below and beside me!",,,
,,"Nice views, overpriced",3,,"Lovely view of Singapore - best at night. I was given free tickets to go on the Flyer so I went, but I would not pay for tickets as I think that is very overpriced. The wheel does 1 rotation and it does so quite slowly so it can get a bit boring.",,,
,,beautiful view of singapore,4,,the views from the flyer are amazing the whole city looks so well planned but the problem is that it is a bit high priced otherwise it is a very good experience to be on the world's tallest ferriswheel,,,
,,Ok ok,3,,"Flyer Singapore, to see singpore like bird's eye.bettr at night. nothing much to shout about. on the ground -variety of local food. hawker street.",,,
,,Worth Doing,4,,"Very pleasant, reasonably priced way to have a good overview of the city - would recommend",,,
,,Great views,4,,"Would suggest to any visitor to Singapore to go on the Singapore flyer, the views are spectacular.",,,
,,Good view,4,,"Very good view takes about 30 minutes. The cabins very stable no sensation of movement or rocking. The views are good but as expected urban, so not not pectactular. Worth the money, although the bar downstairs is very average.",,,
,,great view,4,,not very busy and takes about 20minutes. great view of grand prix track,,,
,,Great view of the city,4,,"Yes, it's tourist, but the views are impressive. Bring you air ticket stub if you've flown Singapore Airways for a 20% discount.",,,
,,Excellent Views,5,,This was a much enjoyed experience if you are not too worried about heights - we aren't.,,,
,,Great views,5,,"Wonderful panoramic views of the city, the marina and the harbour. Great to be able to look down on the F1 Pits as well!
An afternoon visit, so humid, but not raining (yet!) so we had a great flight to ""the top of the world"" and back again.
Not a long walk from the station on the (newish) Circle line and lots to see from all angles.",,,
,,Not informative,2,,"I feel one thing in singapore,particularly at popular places,they are not giving any information,particularly to Indians.They think that we do not deserve more than average behaviour.They were giving one carry bag per ticket to the tourist,we took 4 tickets they only provide one of it but there were groups of white skins provided each one,after asking they replied it was running short.we otherwise not needed bags but the behaviour was not appropriate.The flyer is good and giving replica of london eye.",,,
,,View of the whole Singapore,5,,"Good service and the staff is friendly. Very clean place. You can have a nice view of the whole S'pore, Malaysia and Indonesia border.",,,
,,Great views,3,,I thought it was good for the views but a little expensive at SGD29.50 for adults.,,,
,,Brilliant at Night,5,,"We did the Singapore Flyer at night - it was a spectacular view. If you have a Singapore Airlines boarding pass you can get 20% discount. There are lots of places to eat there too, we had dinner at O'Leary's before going on the flyer. Best way to get there is to catch a Taxi. We didn't have to wait long to get a taxi home, they come in there all the time.",,,
,,sky high,5,,"greta views of Singapore, what a structure!,the experience prior to boarding on how it was built was mind blowing.",,,
,,slow,3,,bit slow but good views if its not rainging. anyways not a bad experience,,,
,,dont miss it,4,,"Great value 拢16 gives you a panoramic view of the river and harbour areas,if you have time incorperate the Duck tour doing both qualifies for a discount Go early and miss the queues",,,
,,Must see even though quite expensive!,5,,"The wheel is very good, safe hard glasses and clean
Its better to visit on evening and you'll see stunning view of Singapore sky crappers and around!
For special honey moon couple should try the romantic dinner on 165 m (541 feet) above the ground!
The price quite expensive for me
Souvenirs stall available near the wheel
The total time for one rotation is about 30 minutes
It was good moment to be here :)",,,
,,A must experience,5,,"This is a brilliant experience. Magnificent views you could not get anywhere else. Very clean and very smooth. Some reviewers have complained of the price - absolute rubbish - it is well worth every cent, and all things considered, is actually very good value.",,,
,,"Gives a great view of Singapore, and is ideal for people who have just arrived.",4,,"The time taken by the Flyer is adaquate, but not too long.",,,
,,Greater than London Eye! The best of the best!,5,,Greater than London Eye! The best of the best! Must do when you are in Singapore!,,,
,,Great view of Singapore,5,,"Its worth to take a ride on the largest ferris wheel in the world to view Singapore's skyline, skyscrapers. If weather premits, you are able to see the Indonesia islands of Bintan & Batam. The capsule is aircond, can accommodate 20 pax comfortably and the ride is about 30 minutes.
I personally prefer the night ride, the lighted up view is great. Its located in downtown Singapore and walking distance to Marina Bay Sands, Esplanade, Merlion.",,,
,,Not much of an attraction,3,,"The gallery to the Singapore flyer was very informative and good. But the flyer ride was very average. There is not much to do except looking at the sky scrapers. It costs 30 SD$ per person which I felt was not worth the ride. We visited the place at the day time so not sure if the ride has something else to offer in the evening.
To sum up, if you have visited the sky tower in marina bay, you can remove the Singapore flyer ride from your itinerary.",,,
,,"Great, but Australia's better!",3,,"If you've been to the Wheel of Brisbane, an unnarrated tour even with a fabulous view, pales in comparison. It's a great view, but the monitors with the scant descriptions aren't enough.",,,
,,The Largest Ferris Wheel in the World,5,,"This slow moving, air-conditioned capsules brings us a wonderful view of Singapore. We even can't feel its smooth movement.
However, it is a pity that the ticket is not cheap, maybe it subsidized the wheel maintenance expensive cost. As far as I know, even many Singaporeans haven't tried this ride because of its price.
.",,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,Fantastic way to see the City. Easy to access and a wonderful experience,,,
,,Good but pricey,3,,"Like with many attractions in Singapore, it's a little pricey but you get a nice view especially at night.",,,
,,The best Views,4,,"I was using a travel guide book which didn't really recommend the Flyer. While exploring the city I found myself in front of it by chance and I am so happy I gave it a try. To say the least, I took some of my best photos of this trip then!",,,
,,Great view!,4,,"We took the ride at night and it was amazing. Great views of the city and you can even take photos through the glass. Our compartment was full, but people were friendly and respectful of everyone's desire to see and take photos. After the ride it was great to walk back to the city center along the marina. The light show and activities along the marina were wonderful. We walked and watched for hours and felt safe the whole time. There were lots of people out and about.",,,
,,Looking at it is good too,4,,"Without a doubt, the city wheels, flyers or whatever they want to call them, are all beautiful at night to ride on or to look at from afar. Treat ourself to a Birdseye view of the open seas and the city sky Scrapers",,,
,,Singapore Flyer - 2012 Still World's Largest,5,,"Take a 40 min ride on the ""world's largest ferris wheel"" in air conditioned comfort and gaze at the beautiful Singapore skyline and the turquoise waters of the South China Sea. A great venue for visitors - and epitomizes the progress of Sinagpore all around you.",,,
,,Nice for taking pictures,5,,Nice view at night or late afternoon. If your checked in at the marina bay sands you can walk coming from the tower 3 exit.,,,
,,Brilliant views,4,,"This was a lot of fun. The only downside was the miles you seemed to have to walk until you got to the actual flyer. Once there, people were a bit pushy getting on but that could have been because of an extremely rude tour guide with her group. The actual cabin was large and spacious and the views were sensational. I think your experience would depend on the people who got in with you. It was unfortunate we had rude people who pushed past us and got in the way a lot. The souvenir shop was very good and the photos they take before you get on are well worth getting as they superimpose them on to different day and night flyer scenes. Well worth visiting.",,,
,,Great views,5,,"Relaxing 30 minutes and a great view of this area of Singapore, went there late afternoon",,,
,,Great view at The Flyer,4,,"The Singapore Flyer is a great observation wheel - slow moving, with air-conditioned capsules and wonderful views of the city and beyond.

On the plus side, the views of Singapore are exhilarating and, with a few friends coming along, there's guaranteed fun and views for all.

On the minus side, the ticket is not cheap and the weather in Singapore is notoriously unpredictable. A cloudy or rainy day could ruin the experience.

Be warned that you have to share the capsule, and the 30-minute ride, with other passengers. Planning ahead before boarding is essential to enjoy the experience.",,,
,,An all round experience,4,,Great experience with stunning views over Singapore. Go early to avoid the queues,,,
,,OK but watch your step in the shop,3,,We visited the Singapore Flyer a few weeks back. We were lucky with both the weather and the queue - both were on our side. We only waited a few minutes but as as entered our cabin we saw a big bus tour arrive. There was only one other small family of three in the cabin with us. It was fairly clear and the views were good. At the end you need to walk out through the gift shop which is very cluttered with very little space to walk around the displays. One of our party accidentally knocked a small ornament and picked it up and put it back on the shelves. Within a few second a sales person appeared and said the ornament had been broken and had to be paid for ($28). We had quite a discussion and in the end my friend did not have to pay - one of our points being that a business would have insurance for breakage and slippage. The episode did detract from the overall experience of the Flyer unfortunately so my advice is to be very careful in the gift shop.,,,
,,DO THE FLYER,5,,It is bigger than the Millennium Wheel in London. It is very slow moving and you get sights of the city 360 degrees. It is well built and each car holds 20 people and is air conditioned. It is well planned. We were shocked to find no line on the Saturday before Easter Sunday. Do it!,,,
,,Great way to see the city,5,,The flyer is a terrific way to see the views of Singapore harbour and city areas. Spectacular views over the Marina Bay area too. A really smooth ride and enjoyable time.,,,
,,What a great view,4,,Well worth the queue to get this Birdseye view of Singapore,,,
,,Good experience,4,,Good experience had a wonderful night on flyer. i will fly again,,,
,,"Great View, rather boreing",2,,"We went on a evening session. There is a lot of hype about the structure. However considering it anything other than a photo oppertunity would be a mistake. I had considered a meal served on the flyer, lucially locals discouraged me and we went to the RitzCarlton resteraunt instead which turned out to be the same price.",,,
,,In a spin,3,,"If you like an air-conditioned capsule, attached to yet another large slow revolving vertical wheel, then this is for you. The first part of the ride, the first 180 degrees, is quite interesting. Pity it is impossible to speed up the next 180 degrees!

There are equally good views from other high buildings in the area. The Sands for one. LeVeL33 for another (where for S$30 you can also get a beer and something to eat. Just).

The crass commercialism on entry and exit grates a lot. Have your photo taken (almost forcibly taken) as you enter and they rush you through. Then have the money ready to pay for the image as you leave after the ride.

Kids will probably love it though.",,,
,,worthwhile ride,5,,Superb 360 degree view of singapore and partial view of indonesia. World largest and cost at only 30 singapore dollsr for the 30 minutes ride. Clean and spacious capsule,,,
,,A must use attraction,4,,"Apparently higher then the London Eye, this wheel gives some excellent views of the city. Well worth the 29 Singapore Dollars. Try to avoid weekends, if you can get there around 10/10.30 on a weekday morning there are no queques",,,
,,Go on a sunny day!,4,,"This was my birthday gift from my hubby. He bought two tickets for about S$70, there was a promotion of 50% off. It was sure worthy that price, I wouldn't pay more than that.
Service was good and fast. Once we entered our pod, two drinks were waiting there for us- just a pity that I am a non drinker, so pretty much I stayed thirsty whole ride, meanwhile my hubby drank both glasses...
We went on a rainy day, so the view was pretty blurred, not very clear.

Wouldn't go back, just if I have a visitors who would appreciate the view. And if the price is still 50% off :)",,,
,,Not at all scary,5,,"I though there would be a much bigger sensation of the movement as the Flyer went around, but it was incredable smooth. Although it was a bit hazy the day we went up, we could see way into the distance.",,,
,,A Great Place to Take in Singapore from multiple vantage points,5,,"The Flyer as it's called is currently the worlds largest observation wheel (Big Eye in London is smaller). While in airconditioned comfort, you get to see Singapore from many height and perspective vantage points. You see the 200+ ships at anchor or preparing to come into Singapore port on one side along with the new Gardens by the Bay being constructed. The other has Marina Bay Sands and the buildings lining Marina Bay/Clark & Boat Quays. It is a stunning setting that can be enjoyed during the day (my favorite) or night (seeing the lights is quite inspiring as well). We like to do the Singapore Flyer, walk over the double helix bridge and then into Marina Bay Sands as one outing in this part of Singapore.",,,
,,The view is better from the top of the sands and its free!,3,,"A pretty cool experience and the wheel is absolutely massive, but the view is a lot better from the top of the sands (its way taller) and it doesn't cost 30$.",,,
,,No surprises - but still fab...!,5,,"What can I say - another city, another twirly wheel. If you like then, you'll love this one - spectacular views of the shipping in the sea and of the city as a whole",,,
,,Great Views Of the City,5,,"One of my highs (literally) in Singapore was a visit to the Singapore Flyer. It looks impressive and endless from the ground up, which is not very surprising: it鈥檚 the biggest Ferris Wheel of the world! London eye is 135 meters, this one is 165 meters!

The structure itself is very impressive to look at, but of course you take the ride for the great views, as you can see on these pictures:

http://ow.ly/a5Ngg",,,
,,Breathtaking ride!,5,,To complete your trip Singapore Flyer should not be missed,,,
,,unforgetable,5,,"If your in Singapour, the Flyer is a must. Specially at night. its not difficult to gest ther as the place is easily accessible by bust, metro and taxis. well it depends on you. but is a unique experience to see Singapour from an elevetated place especially The Marina Bay Complex and the Marina Bay F1 circuit.",,,
,,Excellent views.,4,,"The Singapore Flyer takes 45 minutes for a full rotation. Even if you are afraid of heights, you can sit on the seats in the centre of the very large capsule and get great views of the city. The rotation is slow too. I was there around the middle of the day and even though it was very humid (nice and cool in the capsule!), the day was clear and I took some excellent photographs. Only complaint was finding the place. It took me ages but then again, it was just before the F1 car race.",,,
,,Panoramic view,4,,"Great view over the city. The flyer itself also looks great, especially at night when lit up.",,,
,,good experience,5,,"Great place to see all Singapore form one spot, make good photo.",,,
,,Eagle view of the City,5,,Panoramic view of city with eagle sight. When we wre at the top we could see as far as indonesian Batam islands.,,,
,,Good view at night,4,,"It provides you with a good view of Singapore, but its like any other wheel, best view is at the heightest point.",,,
,,Great view,4,,"This was a great ride. We did not have to wait long on a weekday, and we really enjoyed the view of the city, the port, the MB Sands Hotel, the Merlion, F1 track etc.",,,
,,a little dissapointing,2,,"to be honest i dont feel the attraction is worth the money spent....we always like to see cities from above so decided to go on the flyer, it didnt help that the sky wasnt clear but its possitioning isnt exactly the best so we were dissapointed. maybe it would be better at night",,,
,,"A nice view over Singapore, if your hotel does not provide it",3,,"Our visit was somewhat disappointing, since the view from the roof of our hotel - the nearby Marina Bay Sands - was almost as good. Accessing the venue is not easy - I cannot see how you can get there without taking a taxi or being on a tour. The tickets seemed a bit expensive, but it was a bit too late to turn back once we already traveled there. Otherwise it was really what you would expect with a couple of rounds around on the wheel. The slowly moving gondolas do not stop for embarking or debarking passengers, so I cannot recommend this attraction to people who use a wheelchair or have other problems with mobility.",,,
,,great views but very pricey,4,,Makes it economical if you pick up a map with an offer on the front. We got a 2 for 1 offer on a VIP longe with singapore sling.,,,
,,Wheelchair access,5,,"Just love the flyer and they actually stopped the wheel to allow my MIL s wheelchair to be boarded, she was thrilled",,,
,,Excellent,5,,"The slow rate of this ""eye"" gives one the chance to see the whole city. If you are celebrating it is possible to have a meal on board.",,,
,,"Fear of heights, anyone?",5,,"Fabulous experience, great views of Singapore, probably not a good idea for anyone with a short attention span or a fear of heights as once you're up there you can't get off until your cabin makes a full rotation!",,,
,,Good way to see the city,3,,The flyer is quite expensive (but so are most things in Singapore). It takes about half an hour to do one rotation. However the views are really good from the top.,,,
,,It was a Fabulous Tours,5,,I spend a week in Singapore and decided to take my tours under Singapore Flyer the very famous tours agent in Singapore. I did have my tours and it was amazing.

,,Relax and Enjoy 45 mins of Singapore expedition,4,,"+ Look at Singapore from a new vantage point + Learn more about Singapore history with their audio commentary player - plug, start, listen and learn (All at your own pace)! - It's a 45 mins ride, visit the restroom before you hop on board!",,,
,,nice but kinda boring,3,,"i tried it in the morning, should have been better if it's in the evening",,,
,,An elevating experience,4,,"It is a good experience to visit when you come to Singapore. The best way to have a bird's eye view of the town. As the flyer revolves slowly, you have the time to soak in the sights of Singapore from these capsules. You also get an audio guide when you purchase your ticket which explains everything in front of you. But one is so excited about the experience that you hardly listen to the audio guide and simply marvel at the picturesque sight from the glass capsule!

Warning: Do not fall for the tourist trap of the photos clicked by them. Though they look very pretty they are way too expensive. Your own camera can do the job.",,,
,,"Experience fantastic views of Singapore's city on Singapore Flyer, a gigantic wheel similar to a ferris wheel.",5,,"When you arrive in Singapore, one of the first attractions that looms into view is the Singapore Flyer. The gigantic wheel over 40 stores high is a fun and breath taking way to view the city from every direction high in the sky. The modules are air conditioned and have glass on all sides with capacity for 28 people. You can walk around or sit on the middle benches. Everyone is taking photos. It took us 30 minutes to go around once. Located close to Marina Bay, the Singapore Flyer is a great way to see Singapore and offers great views from every angle.",,,
,,Lovely experience,4,,"The views on top the flyer was lovely on a clear day. You really can see for miles! The entire experience was pleasant, when you enter at the entrance, there is an interactive gallery that is quite fun for the kids. Keeps them entertained if there is a line. The line was short when we were there, remember to go to the restrooms before boarding! :)
We also ate at the Heritage Food Trail after the ride on the flyer. There are many other dining options available.",,,
,,Nice scenery at night,4,,A few sections of exhibition before the ride (which may take you ~ 15 mins). The ride lasts for 30 mins. The ticket is a bit expensive. It's a relaxing activity and you may sit down in the car and rest after a busy day of travelling.,,,
,,"Ferris wheel, XL",3,,"It could be that I am not a fan of ferris wheel, it could also be for the rather costly entry fee, but if I must summarize this ride in a phrase, it would be ""Ferris Wheel, XL"".

It takes quite a queue, and quite a buck, and when you get inside, you'll be trapped with some other group that is complete stranger (except of course if you reserve the whole capsule for private dinner or your own group is big enough to occupy the whole capsule). It's an experience, yes, but not that great. IMHO the view is better from top of Marina Bay Sands.

I recommend this for: (i) overpriced dinner with your spouse, (ii) family with kids, or (iii) big group.",,,
,,Better than expected,5,,"I live in Singapore with my family and we decided to go to Singapore Flyer with our visitors. It was definitely better than expected. During weekdays, just a few people are around. Certainly the evening time with artificial ilumination of the skyline is the best choice. Enjoy!",,,
,,Great View and good entertainment.,4,,"Great view of Singapore and F1 race track. You must visit when it is dark to see the beautiful S'pore lit up in the night. There is a mock rain forest and nice resturants at ground floor. If you have flown SIA, keep the boarding pass, there are discounts. We enjoyed the ride and it is a must for any visitor to Singapore.",,,
,,Not that worth,2,,The flyer is nice and is bigger than the London Eye ok but the view is not as great as the view from Marina Bay Sands Skypark. So my advise is to spend the money going up to the skypark instead of going up there.,,,
,,Scared of heights - No problem,5,,My husband who is scared of heights decided this would be a great visit for our four year old. It is your typical new singapore attraction high tech and I can imagine in peak times you are herded like sheep. We went in off peak and had a great time. We weren't rushed through and it was a great way to see over the city. It is well set up for those who have issues with heights and afterwards we were able to pick up photos and had a relaxing cup of coffee on our way out.,,,
,,Time went too quick,4,,Great views but seem to go faster than the London Eye or maybe I was just enjoying the views too much. Can't say it was good value for money though.,,,
,,Average.,3,,"It's fine, but there is nothing to see. If you have 30 minutes and you have absolutely nothing to do - go for it.",,,
,,Average,3,,It's Ok. Not much to see or to do. If you have 30 minutes you can go.,,,
,,Amazing Experience,5,,"Well what can I say other than what an amazing time we had on the flyer. Woderfull service and a must do when in Singapore,can wait to go again.",,,
,,FANTABULOUS!!!!!!,5,,"I had been on the London Eye, but I do think this far surpasses that, especially with all the attractions within the building where you board the Flyer. The views are nothing short of amazing. I had seen it a year earlier with my granddaughter, and when we were at the very top, she said, ""Grandma, this is awesome."" She was 6 then. I recommend it to all visitors to Singapore.",,,
,,good but expensive experience,4,,Liked the 360' views of tiny little island of Singapore. A bit of the expensive side as it doesn't provide special price for family,,,
,,Few opportunities for an unparallel ferris wheel ride,4,,The flyer offers one of the best vantage points for picture taking if you don't have access to one of the high buildings. It is a ride definitly worth going to check out on a cloudless day. It offers a panaramic view of the Singapore Marina Bay and the East Coast Side all the way to Changi airport where you can see the planes making the approach. I went during the sunset and enjoyed it immensely!,,,
,,Ok experience. Rather costly I'd say,3,,"I'd much rather recommend Marina Bay Sands observation deck over this. It's much higher, much cheaper, and offers much better a view. Sorry flyer.
Also, the MBS deck is stationary, you can spend hours there, plus it has a few awesome restaurants.
Don't understand what's so great about the flyer, honestly :)",,,
