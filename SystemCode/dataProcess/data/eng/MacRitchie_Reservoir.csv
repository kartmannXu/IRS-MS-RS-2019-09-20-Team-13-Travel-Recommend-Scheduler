,,An extraordinary Forest Hiking must have,5.0,,While you visiting Singapore .. done miss forest hiking in “MacRitchie Reservoir” it’s such a breathtaking place for hiking or jogging .. highly recommend
,,Lovely park but trails don't allow dogs,3.0,,A shame you cannot take your dog with you on a stroll through the trails. Nonetheless a great park and urban oasis.
,,Rainforest walks,5.0,,Considering this is literally 10 mins out of the city you really feel you’re in the middle of the rainforest. There are quite a few trails to choose from but we went with the blue one which took us to the tree too walk. It was incredibly humid and was a long trail but we thoroughly enjoyed it! Great for a break from the hustle and bustle of the city. We even got caught in a monsoon like downpour at the end of our trip!
,,One of the oldest reservoir,4.0,,Main attraction here is treetop walk. Lesser known attraction is jelutong tower & it also offers stunning views
,,Great Trail,5.0,,The trail is a total worth. Great escape from the hectic city life and closer to nature. The most enjoyable is the tree top walk (hanging bridge). Totally mesmerizing! But things to take note is beware of monkeys for those who are bring bags.
,,Monkey situation at Macritchie Reservoir is bad,3.0,,"Used to be able have picnics in peace there. Now if you go there for a picnic and lay out the picnic mat laden with food, get ready to pack in a frenzy later."
,,Rude Singaporeans!!,3.0,,"Great trail, but rude Singaporeans ruin the hiking experience by blasting loud music from portable speakers and never giving way to faster runners, hikers or walkers on the trail."
,,walking trail with my dog,3.0,,be careful of snakes and monkeys. do not feed the monkeys. the place is a bit dirty for my dog and in the end we just carried her and walked the rest of the way back to our car.
,,Worth it!,5.0,,"We had an amazing experience on the tree top walk! It is worth the trek and the views are awesome! A must visit spot if you are visiting Singapore. The greenery, the views, the hanging bridge are all worth it!"
,,Peaceful!!,4.0,,The trails were very much enjoyable and I manage to spot different flora and fauna. The TreeTop walk was the highlight of my trip there and it is a must go!
,,Worth the Trek!,5.0,,"This was an amazing day - took the bus from Orchard straight there and then walked round the reservoir including the skywalk. All completely free for you to wander around - although you have to stick to the trails. This gives you a real taste of the jungle albeit very close to the city. Extremely well controlled and natural - so there are no vendors selling fast food - which is the way it should be. You can stop off at the ranger's huts to fill up on water and use the loo but otherwise that's it. We saw terrapins in the reservoir, some bird life and macaques but on the whole this is more of a nature walk with useful signage occasionally to tell you about the plants and their purposes, there are even Durian trees there. The skywalk is well worth a visit, again completely free it is amazing to walk at treetop level. This can involve a lot of walking and climbing steps up and down which in the heat is exhausting however still worth it. Also - not very busy which makes a lovely change. Lovely location."
,,out of city to find the peaceful and green day in singapore,5.0,,"It is not far from Orchard Road, take bus 167 and let bus driver know where you want to get off. Bus stop is close to the entrance of Reservoir, it is natural attraction. 3.8 km to ranger station and about 5.8 km to the Treetop Walk, which is you must go there and try really fun!

There are two ways coming back to city, depend on you choice and following the direction. Our journey is about 5 hours.

Choose a nice day to go there, the raining day would make you feel nasty and muddy, but would have a different feelings.

It is cooler alongside the reservoir. It is free to enter the area. Bus fee is about 2 Singapore dollars one way each people, depends on where you get on."
,,Escape the concrete jungle,5.0,,"Pleasant for walks in the morning, afternoon and evening. Watch monitor lizards, toads, frogs, monkeys and birds. A great place to escape the concrete jungle of CBD."
,,Tree top walk,4.0,,Did the tree top walk to see some monkeys. There were a few around. The walk itself is very nice. Just like walking through a jungles. Plenty of places to stop for a rest as the walk is quite steep in areas with lots of steps.
,,Lovely spot for a picnic,4.0,,"The reservoir is a lovely spot when quiet - you may even spot an otter which unfortunately we did not. A number of short walks, plus the longer walks to the treetop walk or even Bukit Timah Nature reserve."
,,"Beautiful reservoir, great walks!",3.0,,"What a joy to have a mature green Reservoir so close to the city, beautifully landscaped, with boardwalks constructed all around for your walking pleasure. Beware of the many families of monkeys who may be lurking near the sides of the boardwalks hoping for food from walkers. Do not feed them! Car parks are plentiful and there are central toilet facilities and a little cafe canteen. Here at the reservoir, you can choose the length and difficulty of your walks. Canoeing facilities are available too. Most appreciated are the great nature views from most angles."
,,Clean and well run trail for us!,5.0,,"I visited together with my Malaysian friend who hasn't been to Macritchie. Her first impression was there wasn't any mosquitos! Well done for that!

We aimed to conquer the Tree top and managed the yellow route (11km). Terrain was manageable, fairly flat. I was more impressed by the new pathways and it seems friendly for wheelchair users till some extent (not the whole yellow route)."
,,Always an adventure,5.0,,"The MacRitchie reservoir never disappoints, you discover something new every single visit. Absolutely recommend."
,,Nice walk,4.0,,We visited with locals and were surprised by the many monkeys around the reservoir. It is a tranquil spot and used for wedding photography. We did a walk and relaxed. It was not very busy when we were there.
,,A nice place to have a trek in the forest,4.0,,"This place is nice, the top tree walk is fun and macaques are ""friendly"", not aggressive like in other places in the word like Bali"
,,Amazing nature trail,4.0,,"Very exhaustive, with ridges. Great nature trail! Treetop walk as a time limit though, so go early! The weather is better in the morning anyway."
,,Good for walks,5.0,,"Many people go here on weekend mornings to walk or run, the sheer crowd means it's not possible to have a nice run so go on a weekday instead."
,,An Oasis of Serenity,5.0,,"The MacRitchie Reservoir is an oasis of serenity. It’s one of my favourite places for a morning of quiet and reflection. It’s a popular spot for nature lovers and exercise enthusiasts. It’s a gateway to our pristine forest. You can go on hiking trails to enjoy the biodiversity of our nature reserve. On water you can go kayaking and canoeing (they are for rent), and also for fishing. The park is a great place to have picnics and exercises. The iconic MacRitchie bandstand is often used to host performing arts presentations and solemnisation ceremonies. For those looking for an adrenaline rush, hike over to the HSBC TreeTop Walk. There is a reservoir deck equipped with washrooms, showering facilities, lockers, drinking fountains and a food kiosk."
,,Well Worth The Visit,5.0,,"Takes some time to get there via public transportation. Nevertheless, the journey is worthwhile because the area has a nice rural feel. There are also some nice walks around the reservoirs via the MacRitchie Trail and other trails, mostly through wooed areas but sometimes along the water's edge, affording some pleasant views. It's nice to get out of the city sometimes!"
,,A great place to get a taste of the jungle,5.0,,"This is a great location for a walk that gives a feel of the tropics, its secondary growth forest but the birds and monkeys give a great feel. Well maintained paths."
,,nature walk or a paddle,4.0,,"Can hire a canoe here although you are restricted to where you can sail. Monkeys, Mosquitos, ants, turtles and fish to be seen here. need good walking shoes and not just sandals or flip-flops"
,,Great walk,5.0,,"Really enjoyable walk at the MacRitchie reservoir. It took us around three hours to complete, including doing the treetop walk. There is a toilet block half way round with taps where you can refill your bottles.

We saw wild monkeys and a large lizard on the way - but none of the other animals that live in the forests.

It was very busy on a Saturday morning, so I’d recommend weekdays if possible. It’s also very hot, so make sure you have a water bottle with you. There is no food on the route, and because of the risk of monkeys snatching it, you shouldn’t have any in the woodland."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Great urban oasis. Get there early, unfortunately opens at 9. Must take your walking sticks and lots of water. There are two entrances to the reservoir.
The upper Thompson road leading to the Victoria parking lot is closer to the suspension bridge. However, it’s still at least 3-4 Kms of a hike. Lots of stairs and macaques on the way.
You will not be disappointed for sure."
,,Great sport walk in the rain forest,5.0,,I suggest to start from Mc Richie car park ( bus stop) and head to “Tree Top Walk”. The trail is raw and natural. Then cross the walking bridge ( some may find it impressive...) and head back to Venus Car Park ( bus station is not very far). The trail is equipped with a wooden path much more easy to walk. That’s a 3 hour walk that will help you to have a smooth and long night because it is not flat at all. You may encounter many animals including snakes. Better keep on the trail... I suggest to schedule you trip in order to finish at dusk. Walking in the rain forest in half-shade is magic !
,,A jungle in the middle of urban Singapore,4.0,,"This is the beauty of SG how they have preserved a lot of green amidst urban skyscrapers. If suddenly you feel like a short hike or want to breathe more oxygen or simply get out of the urban setting, just visit Mac Ritchie Reservoir and keep walking till you get lost inside.Only I wish there was a spot to sit down at the treetop and soak in the jungle view and just relax for a while after that hike up, instead you have to rush back down, since its a narrow lane."
,,Super nice Reservoir/Park to stroll or trekking,4.0,,"It's always nice to visit the reservoir. Also for animal lovers, you will find monkeys so easily. My favourite trail is the tree top trail. NOTICE: Closed on Mondays, except on Public Holidays."
,,"Fabulous long walk around reservoir, including Tree Top",5.0,,"Got the bus to start of MacRitchie trail. We followed the yellow route around the reservoir, through the forest. Because it was a Public Holiday, there were quite a lot of people on the trail. Good job we took plenty of water, as this was a long, hot, humid walk. Eventually reached the Tree Top trail, which is excellent, as long as you don't suffer from vertigo!

The paths and boardwalks are well maintained. We saw one monitor lizard and several other animals, including monkeys, who predictably were stealing fruit from unsuspecting picnickers. The path is alongside the Singapore Golf Club for a few kilometers, so we watched some of the golfers.

No cafes were open, so we took the bus back to Novena for a very late lunch."
,,Hours of free walk in the nature,4.0,,"Another fantastic place for couples, especially when we can hike or jog together. Done a 5km track with my boyfriend, the route is easy and is beautiful. Not recommended to run alone as there was some mishap previously."
,,This is where i used to go jogging back in school,5.0,,"well this is where we would be asked to run 3.6km during school days. one of best well kept nature reserve in Singapore,"
,,Very relaxing and beautiful,5.0,,"This definitely a place everyone should visit. The area is a nice getaway from the busy Singapore streets. Could use a couple more places selling water, but its not their fault we were a little unprepared."
,,Great Place to Find Nature,5.0,,"MacRitchie Resevoir is a great place to escape urban Singapore. There are areas along the trails and boardwalks in the park which have you surrounded by nature.

If you take the waterside boardwalks and invlude the treewalk, the full walk around the resevoir can stretch over 8 miles.

I see monitor lizards, longtail macaque monkeys, and turtles every walk here."
,,Nice reservoir,5.0,,"Here you can enjoy the atmosphere, the breeze. Relax your eyes and ears with the beautiful trees and shrubs inside the forest.. Unfortunately, we walked 4km-5km but never saw the monkeys, maybe they are more further inside."
,,A Historic Place,5.0,,Defended by the British when the Japanese invaded Singapore in 1942 and hard fought over. Now a tranquil place of relaxation and water sports
,,Walking trail,5.0,,"A Refreshing walk into the woods of Singapore. Enjoy the breeze, and admire the various trees & shrubs; flowers & leaves as you pass by. Put on walking shoes, mosquito stickers, hat, caps, sunglasses & use umbrella if necessary."
,,Macaques at MacRitchie,4.0,,We did the long walk round the reservoir into the jungle involving the nature trail. Theplace is big enough that there are times when you see no-one else ( unlike the much busier Bukit Timah Nature Reserve). We saw lots of monkeys at several points on the walk
,,A tranquil haven,5.0,,This is a lovely excursion if you want to get off the beaten track and see something different. I took a MRT to Caldecott station and walked 15 mins to the nature reserve centre. From there I had the option of doing several trails of varying distances. Most people probably do the trail involving the tree tops walk (about 11km) but I chose the shorter purple trail which is about 6km. This can be done as a loop with the first half through dense forest and the way back along a boardwalk which skirts the edge of the reservoir. There were a few joggers but it was very peaceful and at times it was just me (and the monkeys!). The track was well made - there was some surface water from the previous day’s rain so probably best to wear closed shoes. There is a cafe at the centre with toilets (and even lockers for those wanting to jog). Afterwards I took the 166 bus back into town. All in all a pleasant experience and refreshing not to have to stand in queues and pay crazy prices.
,,Nice green area in Singapore,4.0,,"We really enjoyed a morning spent at the MacRitchie Reservoir. You can hire a canoe (kids have to be 7 or older), walk the trails or just enjoy the scenery. Lots of locals come here to exercise and there is some exercise equipment as well as a large public show/toilet facilities with a cafe."
,,Interesting walk,5.0,,"You can get to the reservoir using the metro, get off at Caldecott MRT Station (cc17) and walk, it's very cheap. There is a map in the station, its not too far. It's free entry and the walk around the reservoir is about 14km depending on your exact route, it is very hot and humid and there is no where to get drinks apart from at the main entrance so take lots of water. It's a nice walk through secondary jungle with plenty of wildlife, we saw lots of birds and butterflies, water monitor lizards, macaques and turtles. Definately worth a visit"
,,Hiking demanding for young kids,5.0,,"We started hiking just after 9am and took about 3 hours walking 10km. Most trail was shaded, so quite comfortable in Singapore heat. Definitely bring along water. Treetop walk was the highlight. Kids really enjoyed it. It was a little challenging for kids to go all the way without much break."
,,Great for a walk or run,4.0,,"Fancy some exercise? Take a stroll around the reservoir or run along the trails. Enjoy the scenic view away from the hustle and bustle of city life.

If you wish to avoid the heat of the day, best time to visit would be earlier in the morning or later in the evening.

Be prepared with proper footwear."
,,excellent for walking/running workout,4.0,,"This park area surrounds one of Songapore's large reservior/lakes with various trails and plenty of places just to relax.

One can have a simple walk along the boardwalk surrounding half the lake. Sometimes good size monitor lizards can be seen, some crossing the board walk to go into the forest.

Or walk/run along the unpaved trails within the forest. Be careful of the runners especially on weekend mornings.

Starting from the main car park or the bus stop after all the plant nurseries, it will take 3+ hours walking along the boardwalk, to the ranger station, to the hanging bridge, back by the ranger station, and along the dirt path return along the otherside of the lake. Finish at the cafe with a cool coconut juice.

Excellent walk!"
,,For trail runs and hikes,5.0,,"The entire perimeter of the reservoir is about 15km and took us about 4 hours to complete. From Venus Dr in Upper Thomson, you can get to the Tree Top walk and proceed towards the golf course along Adam Rd. Try the board walk and enjoy the waterfront view with the jungle beside you or do a trail run in the well maintained trails. At the mushroom cafe, it would be the last water point cum toilet area before you get to the east of the reservoir past canoe station. The trek or waterfront boardwalk towards Venus Dr will take another 7km uphill. Other than the golf area, you will be in the forest with tree cover. Trails are well maintained, safe and boardwalks are regularly checked and cleared of leaves! Go in the week day and have the entire park to yourself"
,,One of the most Beautiful nature park in singapore,4.0,,"Its always nice to go to the nature reserve of a country to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Its very well maintained and nice reservior walk, trail walk and tree top scenery."
,,"My place to relax, meditate and hide",4.0,,"People mind their own business. There are few friends that may gather there and chat in the sitting areas. Times there will be cross-country runs. By and large, away from the entrance area, it is a place to jog, exercise, explore, admire the green trees and the nation's largest reservior, watch wild life and get away from the busy life of modern Singapore. There are monkeys, squirrels, monitor lizards and birds to watch out for, There is a tree-top walk, of walking above many tall trees, providing enjoyment of the tranquility of nature. Treetop Walk, a 250-metre aerial free standing suspension bridge, is 11 km trail loop. It is a place where you can spend a short time or few hours, walking to nearby reservoirs and the golf course. After a short visit, I can feel recharge and refresh. There are more green areas in Singapore today but few as big and enriching as this. Nature has done its work over many decades, developing the forest and nature trails. The best time to visit is early morning or evenings, when it is not so hot. There are ample parking space and amenities."
,,Good place for a jog,5.0,,I went for my first ever run at MacRitchie Reservoir with my family the other day and I must say it is very nice. I enjoyed it very much. The fresh air is unlike no other!
,,Monkey see,5.0,,"Had a free day on a two week APAC trip and needed some exercise. MacRitchie Reservoir did the trick. Beautiful, peaceful hike by the lake. We did not make it all the way to the tree top walk because we got there too late in the day. The trail is suitable for walking or running. Not steep gradient so the hike is not too strenuous. Most of the hike is in the shade and was bug free.

Some tips:
Bring plenty of water- there is no place along the walk to get some- Singapore is smoking hot
Bring shoes that will accommodate light muck. The trail was generally dry but that’s because it did not rain that day. Since much of the hike is on light gravel/ dirt it will muck up quickly. You do not need hiking shoes just don’t stress if your Nike’s get dirty.
Try and get out early in the am to avoid the peak heat
If you want to see monkeys( which we did), hike near the golf course
Look for monitor lizards when you are closet to the lake."
,,Best park in Singapore,5.0,,I’ve been to MacRitchie many! Every time again I realise how amazing the park is. Great for running (big lap 10.5km) or hiking around.
,,beautiful,5.0,,"lovely place, stunning surroundings & some great walks around the reservoir. Would be a nice place to paddle a canoe or kayak for a day"
,,Beautiful lake with outdoor activities,4.0,,"Escape the hustle of the city to this reservoir with a nature trail, lake and a TreeTop walk. Various outdoor activities like canoeing."
,,Transquality,5.0,,The reservoir felt serene and quiet. Not very crowded when we visited. Lovely birds and monkey around the area. Must go again.
,,The nature in he middle of the city,5.0,,"Very nice place to relax, have a walk or do exercises. so clean and calm but dogs are no allow in all the area, only in few parts."
,,Get close to nature,4.0,,Wonderful natural attraction and I love the jogging trail which cuts through the forest. Female joggers might want to bring a friend along though.
,,A nice park close to nature,5.0,,"A good place for a hike or a jog in the morning or evening.
recommended to start early morning so you may reach the Tree Top walk if you are hiking as a group.
be careful when u are in the jungle trail. sometime, snakes and monitor lizard may be seen. Personally been there pretty often and had a fair share of the encounter. Just be more observant.

forest trail will be very muddy in wet day. so be prepared to be slippery and dirty if you were to walk or jog after the rain.
in the forest trail it not recommended to go in after 6.30pm. it can get pretty dark in there will all the trees blocking off the late evening sun."
,,A quick escape from the city. MacRitchie Reservoir,5.0,,Right in the centre of Singapore is MacRitchie Reservoir . An oasis of calm and peace. Easy access .
,,Don't believe the distance signs,4.0,,"It's incredible that such a massive nature reserve is within the city of Singapore! Very easy to get to on the MRT, the signage on what is where is clear and easy to follow, BUT, the distances to the treetop walk are a little deceiving. Especially once you get ot the treetop walk and there is a 1.5-2km loop to get back to the ranger hut at the start of the walk, let alone the 5km back to the entrance to the reservoir. However, the distances aside, the walk was beautiful, the scenery was gorgeous and the wildlife was plentiful, monkeys, birds, water monitors....."
,,A relaxing morning walk,5.0,,Always wanted to start exercising again. And my hubby decided to bring me there for a morning stroll. It has been ages since I last come back but the weather was excellent and the walk is enjoyable.
,,Tranquil oasis within the city limits,5.0,,"Great walking trail that includes a suspension bridge and lot's of steps to really give you a good work out as well as a quiet and peaceful walk in lovely surroundings. A great place for a morning walk but ensure that you take some water with you as it is very humid and you sweat a lot. There are also activities such as canoeing that you can try out, however, I tended just to go along for the walk which at a leisurely pace you can do in around 90 mins or so. Plenty of parking if you drive."
,,MacRitchie Reservoir,5.0,,An interesting walk in the middle of the city. I saw my first water dragon here and it was huge! There is a nice canopy bridge to oversee the foliage and a look-out tour.
,,Walk through the wooden path way and see the splendour,5.0,,"When you have some time off, it is a lovely place to visit. I have visited it multiple times and there are lot of awesome trails to cover."
,,11 km walk including TreeTop,4.0,,"Walked anticlockwise around the Reservoir, including TreeTop (which is one way). Easy walk on a good track. Nice break from the city."
,,Get away from the city,4.0,,A nice place to go for a walk and get away from the city. Went late in the day and had enjoyable walk along the side of the reservoir with trees coming down to the water. Paths are well maintained. Not a difficult walk at all and passed a few locals running and some kids fishing (fishing is not allowed BTW). Would recommend as an evening thing to do. You will probably see monkeys which is an added bonus.
,,A better perspective of Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore is more than a highly evolved modern city with safe MTR and Lux shopping, its a rainforest with gorgeous nature trails! Take a walk on the wild side and hike to the tree top bridge. Gorgeous natural scenery, no visable skyscrapers or road noise in the distance. Singing birds, swimming turtles and if you are lucky a wild monkey encounter. Loved it! Would highly reccommend!"
,,With friends,5.0,,"Family friend place. Nice to avoid the hustle and bustle. Water cooler stations available to refill your bottles. Do not visit on PH, the queue to Treetop Walk is extremely long unless you go early in the morning."
,,Nice COzy cool place,3.0,,"The drive to the place is quite awesome, can see lot's of monkeys and quite winding and nature all round. The reservoir is not that big, the walkway and some minor trekking is good and very calm and serene place. worth to go there for some fresh air"
,,The park was beautiful if people can be more courtesy.,3.0,,"It was a beautiful park, however walking beside the pond with young children can be dangerous as many park goers took up majority of the walk path with umbrellas open to shade the sun. We had a few close call almost being pushed into the pond."
,,MacRitchie Reservoir Singapore,4.0,,A water catchment reserve which is nicely maintained and structured. It had thus became a good place for walks and runs.
,,Jungle in the city,5.0,,"A jungle in the bustle city which can be reached by 15-20 min by taxi. The park is well facilitated with shower and restaurant. You should bring clean clothes to there to change after hiking. I saw on the internet that it takes 4hr for whole trail, we went on the trail with tree top bridge and took like 2hr.
You can also do kayaking there."
,,Nice park in the middle of Singapore,5.0,,"We have been to this park multiple times, and its a lovely place to hang out. Try out the kayaking as well!"
,,MacRitchie Reservoir Tree top Walk,5.0,,"A gateway to Singapore’s nature reserves, the MacRitchie Reservoir Park is a popular spot for nature lovers and exercise enthusiasts. With hiking trails, kayaks and canoes for rent, it is also a great place for recreational activities, both on land and in water."
,,Walking the dog,5.0,,"Good balance of well maintained park and reservoir and a natural reserve. Well done to National Parks Board.

The trail also takes one to and through treetops walk which I will do one day when I don’t have dog with me - pets ok for the reservoir park area but not allowed on the nature trails.

It used to so illegal to fish at the reservoir but nowadays there are designated fishing spots but haven’t fishing. Guilty pleasures no longer if not guilty anymore perhaps."
,,Serene,5.0,,"Been here so many times! I love going here to walk because it's so peaceful makes you feel stress-free. You can also run, cycle or just spend time with your family."
,,Great walking spot in a serene environment,5.0,,"All people should visit here. its one of Singapores best kept secrets because its a little further out. The tree tops walk is brilliant, but make sure you take plenty of water with you. A round trip is 11 km. the boardwalk is great and you often see monkeys."
,,Best place for walking and kayaking,5.0,,"To be encounterd by monkeys and other wild animals, you don't have to go to the zoo. If you like walk in the breeze, to Explore the floras, just come here, it's quieter and serene forest, and you will feel like a local. By the way, you may be interested to try kayaking in the lake, but the main lane is only for professional trainer, so still enough space for you told try and feel the real peace or fun in there. Do remember there are only certain time to open for public, check the website to find the timing for kayaking before you go, and prepare a spare bottom with you because you will get wet definitely. Don't worry, there is a shower room and rest area, even a few cafe. Singapore Laska is a must try, yummy!"
,,Place to zen in nature's smells and sounds,4.0,,Go early and to avoid crowd go on weekday mornings. Parking is free on weekdays too. It has shower facilities and place for food if you are hungry before or after your activity here. Most importantly enjoy the natural ambience of the simple smells of shrubs and flora and the singing or tweeting of the birds. You may happen to inconveniently bump into real monkeys. Just don't provoke them.
,,Good Walking Paths and Monkeys,4.0,,It was raining when we were there so we didn't walk as far as we would have otherwise. It's a lovely setting full of walking paths with water views. There were several long-tailed macaques right near the entrance and these were a delight to watch. We didn't see any monitors though.
,,"Walking, views, birds, history",5.0,,"It is very easy to reach MacRitchie Res. Hop off Caldecott MRT and you're there! In fact you're at the Mushroom Cafe (also called Setia) which is ideal. Have a quick snack or a meal, fill your water bottle, visit the near by loo, & you're off! Otherwise MRT Marymount is just as convenient.
Everyone wants to walk across TTW (Tree Top Walk) with good reason! Stunning views, especially if the weather's nice. You'll be warned half a dozen times that TTW has One Way Traffic Only!!! It's very narrow (basically no overtaking slower people) so the one way rule is quite reasonable. I thought I'd like to do the TTW, walk around the circuit and back to the start and do it a second time... but I was misled by the map. What looks like a short circuit is actually quite lengthy, and there are so many other parts of the park to visit, that I didn't bother. But I crossed behind slow people, so I saw plenty from TTW anyway. One very important consideration: TTW is closed for maintenance every Monday! So pick another day to visit!
After TTW you continue southward and come to Jelutong Tower which provides nice views. Throughout the park you'll see a plethora of birds, possibly macaques, definitely monitors and terrapins... and if you're improbably lucky a pangolin (but they tend to be nocturnal).

Continuing south you go over a tiny bridge which spans a stream which is full of very large terrapins. Have a close look at the walls or parapets or whatever you'd call them on either side of the bridge. These are historic and assumed to be built by POWs during WWII. After the bridge you come to a small clearing on the left with a view of MacRitchie Reservoir. If you look closely you'll see some white sticks poking up out of the water. These sticks indicate where the bridge built by POWs used to be. Looking across the Reservoir you can see a dark hole in the wall of foliage. That's where the Syonan Jinja (built by POWs) used to be.
You can continue south and visit more of the Reservoir, or skirt around the side of the golf course to gain access to PIE (the Pan-Island Expressway) where you can snag a bus going to MRT Caldecott and MRT Marymount. You might be tempted to take a short-cut along the golf club roadway, but they have several signs which say 'please' don't walk on our roadway... Well, when someone says 'please' you tend to comply!"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"This nature walk amongst luscious trees and undergrowth with its local inhabitants of monitor lizards and monkeys is well worth the trip. There are times when you think you are in the wilderness when realistically the city and its motorways is only 1km away. Watch out for the monkeys - they are cute but be mindful they are wild. The boardwalk is lovely along the waters edge. The treetop walk is closed Mondays. The trail is rocky in places and steep. Wear good walking shoes and take plenty of water.
This walk is well worth it!!"
,,"Mingle with monkeys and monitor lizards, join the joggers, or saunter with the strollers.",5.0,,"MacRitchie Reservoir is well worth a visit, if you can spare the time between all the other wonderful treats on offer in Singapore. Not quite the 'nature experience' of Pulau Ubin or Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, but it does provide a welcome break from the city bustle. Be careful of offering food to the monkeys - you may find they have many more hungry friends nearby! A safe a pleasant stroll awaits around the waterside, with an abundance of wildlife. Apart from the monkeys and lizards, you'll likely spot turtles, colourful butterflies, radiant birds and secretive snakes. A great half-day out!"
,,Macritchie reservoir review,5.0,,"We visited the Macritchie Reservoir on June 8, 2018. Take bus number 74 from Tan Ka Kee MRT station. It stops in front of the reservoir. Minimum time required for this attraction is 1 hour. Restaurant and toilets are nearby. Ideal for all age groups and entry free.Best seen during day light. It rained very heavily when we went. Best to check the weather information."
,,take the path near to the reservoir,3.0,,"There are two ways one is in between tree and other one is near to reservoir, the second one will be good. We can able to see few turtle and monitor lizard."
,,Good trek,4.0,,"Nice place to go if you want to spend one day outside of Singapore. Pretty far from the center but if you have time, I will suggest to visit it."
,,Wonderful place for evening walk,5.0,,"It is a perfect place if you loves natural and green field. If you lucky, you able to enjoy beautiful sunset just at the reservoir.

There are water activities here also, many student get their training here for kayak and canoing.

There are natural trail to explore also, and they takes more than 2hours to complete a cycle.

It is a great park. And you can also get a light snack or light meal at a cafe stationed near car park. Price there is reasonable. I get myself a sardine curry puff and 100plus insotonic drink, cost SGD2.90.

This place is easy to access by public transport too."
,,Must do it,5.0,,"I have been invited by some friends for a Sunday morning walk in this area.
The day was cloudy and after half an hour it started raining. We continued walking for three hours and 13km. We simply could not stop because the atmosphere was so unbelievable...

Fishes, monkeys, butterflies, birds, insects... and the lake.

Under the rain it is spectacular..."
,,A Hiking Trip,5.0,,This is one of the rare few nature reserves in Singapore that offers a decent hiking trail and there are varied levels of difficulty that caters to the needs of all kinds of hikers.
,,Great Getaway,5.0,,We wandered around the MacRitchie Reservoir for a couple of hours and we really loved being in nature in the heart of the red dot. The reservoir is large and very serene. Its a great way to spend a perfect Saturday/Sunday outdoors.
,,Back to Nature,4.0,,"MacRitchie is a fantastic side of Singapore! Just a short trip from the CBD is this oasis of nature for those who want to see a little of Singapore's wild side. Snakes, lizards, birds, monitors are all there for the observant hiker. Well worth a walk along the boardwalk!"
,,Brilliant nature walk,5.0,,A great alternative activity for singapore. Well kept nature reserve with water available at the ranger station. All the trails are extremely well marked out and clear to understand. The tree top walk was lovely. There are a lot of steps and more challenging parts so need to be reasonably fit!
,,Happy Hiking!!,5.0,,"Great outdoor hike through a scenic forest. The treetop walk and suspension bridge gave a great view of both the park, ocean and city. Make sure to stay hydrated but a must do!!"
,,Beautiful walk although it might be quite humid,4.0,,"My title basically applies to Singapore as a whole, but this area, in particular, can be quite humid as the lake/reservoir can evaporate a lot of water (and the trees generate a lot of humidity) especially towards the midday.

We got here around 12:45 pm, once we finished the 10k walk of the MacRitchie Nature Trail (which I have reviewed as well) and the heat was getting a good part of our mood. The scenery changed that after a few minutes. The multiple bridges and well-placed hut every now gives you the opportunity to really chill out and enjoy the park/walk.

The walk is truly beautiful and the water looks so nice that I wanted to just jump in and have a swim.

If you ask me to define it with fewer words it would be:

A beautiful natural place to enjoy and relax.

Enjoy your trip :)"
,,Awesome Nature Walk!!!,4.0,,"After a long discussion and debate, me and my husband decided on MacRitchie Reservoir to spend a day. What an awesome time we had spend exploring the nature and feet good. We were just walking and walking and only walking... Such a peaceful, serene and feel good atmosphere one can experience here!!! Never thought Singapore had such a wonderful and well maintained nature like in the midst of the city. Not recommended to go with toddlers/kids!!"
,,GREAT WALK TO BUKIT TIMAH HILL,5.0,,I like to catch the bus to MacRitchie and hike south through the Island Golf course on to Rifle Range Road and from there up Bukit Timah Hill and then on to Dairy Farm Road and the finally to Hillview MRT and then to a cold beer somewhere. It takes about 3.5 hours at an easy pace but note there is no drinking water anywhere on the hike. its a great hike
,,Good leisurley walk,4.0,,"Not the easiest place to find for tourists - thence ots more locals that are in abundance when you get there. Good signposted trails range from 1-4 hours.
Take plenty of water as once you start there are no places to buy. Also check the weather before you set out - singapore does get rain!"
,,Tranquility and nature,5.0,,"Was a time for reconnecting with friends from a trip and just spending time in nature, away from the hustle and bustle of the busy life in Singapore, over food, fellowship and just generally a time of reconnecting with creation. This is a place is a must to visit, definitely recommend comfortable closed shoes, sun screen, hat,poncho, at least 1.5 l water (can refill at ranger station) and umbrella(just in case). The earlier you get there the better as on the weekend gets really busy. There are short routes that you can take but if you fit enough, do the full route, well worth the walk, tree top walk is also amazing. Good thing to do is a weather check before going. There are other activities on the the reservoir like canoeing etc. Great place just to chill as well, always a quiet spot to be found."
,,A Proper Jungle in the middle of the Concrete Jungle,5.0,,"If you're looking for a place to recharge in nature after a busy week, MacRitchie Reservoir trails don't disappoint. You find families, people trail running and slow trekkers all in one place. I got to (luckily) spot snakes, monkeys, millipedes, butterflies, birds etc. during my walks. It's always rewarding!"
,,Such a joy,5.0,,"I truly love these well maintained, plush green parks and reservoirs. I enjoyed a short run through the park, along with a recovery stroll. So peaceful, quiet, full of natural beauty."
,,10k nature hike,4.0,,Just finished a 10k nature park/ reservoir hike. What a beautifully thought out route. Lots of monkeys on the trail so hold onto your bags the little guys are not shy. Take plenty of water and save your bottles to refill at ranger station. The elevated trail through the trees is worth the hike by itself.
,,Touring my own country :),5.0,,"My man and I are back in Singapore for Chinese New Year. We both love nature, so I took him for a little walk in one of Singapore's little rainforest parks - the MacRitchie Reservoir Park. The Park is also home to the HSBC Treetop Walk - a suspension bridge, which allows you to get up close to the flora and fauna from high up.

However, in order to properly appreciate this Park, you need time and energy. We arrived at around 8AM, walked the entire trail (approx 11km) and left the Park at about 1PM. Hence, I would only recommend this Park to people who:-
(a) can afford more time in SG than a Singapore Airline Stopover;
(b) can stand walking for hours in the tropical heat and humidity;
(c) are not afraid of monkeys and snakes. :)

What to wear and pack?:-
- Cool and breathable cotton clothes.
- Good walking/hiking shoes and socks - we did our walk in sandals, but I wouldn't recommend it. You can get nasty twigs piercing your toes. (ouch!)
- Water (we had 2 litres between us)
- Small towel (I sweat like no tomorrow)
- Sun protection (sunglasses, hat, umbrella, sunblock) as some parts of the Park are not shaded.
- Natural mosquito repellent.
- Your camera of course! :)

How to get there?
Take a public bus and alight at Bus-stop ID: 51071 - MacRitchie Reservoir.

Gentle reminder:
Respect nature and do not litter. Please speak softly and do not create a racket. There'll always be some inconsiderate people around who has a disability to shut up, but we don't have to degenerate to their level."
,,A good break from the concrete jungle,5.0,,"The boardwalks are set amidst thick leafy canopies which provided a cool shade from the scorching sun. If you want a tranquil walk and a chattering conversation with a few squirrels and curious monkeys, this is the place to go."
,,"Nice walk, treetop walk average",3.0,,"Beautiful place, however I went to do the treetop walk and wasn’t worth the 5km walk to get there, although the view of the forest was nice it was short and full of people stopping on the way. Wild monkeys and squirrels were cool to see"
,,Nature in concrete jungle,4.0,,In a land scarce country like Singapore having such a big nature place is really expensive. This is a place where you can easily spend a few hours with nature. There are a few different tracks of different distance that you can select based on your own physical fitness. The tracks although man made integrate well with nature.
,,A nice walk away from the city,4.0,,"Being in nature is always a wonderful feeling. I started the walk at around 2pm. It's quite late and I was expecting the strong sun rays but surprisingly, it was quite cooling in the rainforest. Expect to walk about 5 km from Mushroom Cafe to reach the Treetop Walk. Treetop walk is about 250 m long. It's a great feeling to be standing atop the canopy. You can even see Pierce Reservoir from the bridge.

In all, we walked for about 8km. The walk is overall manageable. Be prepared to go up some gentle slope. I am not an exercise fanatic but I managed the walk. I'm sure many others can do it too!"
,,Get close to nature!,4.0,,"This park is easily accessible using the MRT and is away from the hustlle bustle of the city, this is also close to Singapore golf club and good for hiking. I like the view and way the park is. Must go if you are in a Singapore for more than 3 days."
,,Run the park 10km loop,4.0,,"This is such a good trail run whether you train or want a casual off the PCN run

Note: locker and shower facilities will make the cool down a gracious period whether you are covered in mud and /or sweat

Do not only look at your feet and enjoy wildlife!"
,,Beautifully Tranquil,5.0,,"I went here as a break from the hustle and bustle of the city and I got that. There were a number of walks signposted of different lengths and degrees of difficulty. I opted for the boardwalk round the reservoir and it was a delight. The occasional walker and jogger, but if i saw a dozen folk in 3 hours I'd be exaggerating. I'd recommend stocking up on water from the reasonably priced cafe at the beginning. The walk has benches at regular intervals and information signs. I did wonder if the placing of the snake information sign at abut halfway was deliberate. Talk about rock and a hard place! Still, our paths never crossed, but I did see an impressive array of bird and dragonfly life.
I didn't make it to the TreeTop Walk, so one for next time. If you want to unwind, or maybe use the exercise equipment, I can heartily recommend a visit here."
,,Historical place to keep healthy,4.0,,"MacRitchie Reservoir was named after the Municipal Engineer James MacRitchie in 1922.
It’s a great place for walks and exercise. Be inspired by older people walking or the teens kayaking. The trees and shrubs give much needed shade.

The distinctive zig-zag bridge and Performing Arts Pavilion bring back childhood memories for many Singaporeans.
Nearby there are clusters of pandan (screw pine) plants which give off a lovely fresh scent.
As students from decades ago, we ran our first cross country races as teenagers.

This place should not be missed."
,,Good for easy hiking!,4.0,,Have not visited MacRitchie Reservior for a while and decided to join a group of friends for a early morning hike. Glad I woke up for it. It’s surprising to find such a nice place by the waters for food easy exercise and lots of fresh air. Will be back for more!
,,Top park,5.0,,if you like nature and walk trought the forest is a nice place to visit. An adventure with very beautiful landscape.
,,Fabulous park!,5.0,,"The Saturday I arrived early in the morning, 100's of weekend athletes were just finishing their runs/walks/canoeing/kayaking, exhausted and matted with sweat and mud. Impressive! The friendly folk were aglow with accomplishment. The lake was beautiful and the trails were well maintained and free of any trash.
The humidity and dew points were off the scales, such that this tourist was struggling on the hike towards the Treetop walk. Much older and much younger walkers were flying past me.....and I am supposed to be a champion power walker!
I lasted only an hour on the trail......soaked with perspiration.

This is really a beautiful park and should be enjoyed by all. Gauge carefully how long you wish to hike into this magnificent jungle!"
,,Nature in the city,5.0,,I feel like nature in the city. I arrived around 10am and decided walking the longest tail ~12km. I spent 3hrs along the tail. Many people come to this place for running.
,,Nice place to walk around,5.0,,"This is the place i used to do jogging on every saturday morning during my school days. After so many years, it is so well maintained.

It is a nice place to bring along your family members to exercise around the reservoir, there is also a cafe in the park not far away from the car park, there is also a bistro there too.

For those who are into photography, you can definitely find many beautiful spots to take pictures.

Overall it is a nice place to visit."
,,love this park for my morning runs,5.0,,Nice place to do your morning runs. U lucky can see some nature animals too. dont anyhow feed later monkeys follow you back
,,Nice and relaxing,5.0,,"This reservoir area is right next to a golf course. the reservoir is very nice a quite, it is perfect place for a walk or jog."
,,Natural Trail in the middle of town,5.0,,Any fitness enthusiasts or Trail blazer if you have not been to the reservoir and it’s trails then your nirvana is not destined. Anyone visiting and wanting to have Trail experience — do not miss this. It has all terrain for the right training. I am going to be a regular member.
,,Don’t stare at the monkeys!,5.0,,"Fun fact. Walking through the tree-covered walkways in MacRitchie reservoir is really pleasant, several degrees cooler than the city. The combination of a gentle breeze and shade makes the 11 km stroll completely doable, without sunglasses! Do bring bug spray though, there are a few mosquitos about, not terrible, and a water bottle. There are places to refill, but particularly the walk back from the bridge can be very long without water. Also, we encountered a monkey on the bridge, who stalked past us and hired menacingly at my daughter, when she studied him too closely. (There really was nowhere for her to go, they were both “trapped” on the bridge). She escaped with nothing more than a bit of a scare, but it would probably not have happened if she had taken the sign to “Not stare at the monkeys” more seriously. Monkey passed me without incident."
,,Challenging stroll,5.0,,"Yet another great walk has a few inclines as well as a great view from the bridge, how some people run along here beats me but the runners are pleasant people unlike others we have come across in other countries.Take water if you visit."
,,Peaceful and bright place,5.0,,"It was a quiet and shiny place.
Free from a urban life, to feel such peaceful nature was a good relief for Singapore residents.
Our family could have a good and slow time since there was a little bit complexed bridge or so around the lake and also we could see small fishes and beautiful dragonflies.
The restaurant was a little bit expensive but we satisfied fully about the western branch menu. We didn’t try but there was a lot of Japanese foods. Next time, we’ll try it."
,,Oldest reservoir in Singapore.,4.0,,"The grand old dame of Singapore's reservoir parks, and a perennial favourite spot for recreational activities e.g. birdwatching, jogging, and kayaking.

- Excellent for families.
- Parking available, but tends to be full on weekends.
- Food, shower and lockers available.
- The HSBC Treetop Ealk (single-direction) can now be easily accessed via Island Club Road.
- A walk around the perimeter of the reservoir (1.5h, boardwalk) is recommended. Do not feed or harass the wildlife.
- The area around the zig-zag bridge is photogenic.
- If you have time, proceed to the adjacent Chestnut Nature Park and Windsor Nature Park That'll have your morning and early afternoon covered.

- For the adventurous, bash through the dense forest to locate a bombed-out wartime Japanese shrine called Syonan Jinja. Remnants of a stone bridge can be found at the western edge of the reservoir. Do not attempt to swim across."
,,Pretty lake with monkeys,5.0,,We had a nice walk through this area so my partner could see monkeys. Great place for monkeys without heaps of people.
,,Chill out in a beautiful place!,5.0,,"Some people come to run, some to kayaking, stand up, fishing... I like to hiking specially on the trails over the water."
,,Weekend Gateway to nature,5.0,,"Once you enter the park, you get a sigh of relief. You will feel connected to nature. It is just because in Singapore everything is man made except this place.

It is good place for running as well as hiking as there are both type of trails. Bring your own water bottle and food as you will not get anything inside.

Also, there is a treetop: from which you can see the whole park. It’s a different experience as you will find all trees below you. Do remember tree top closes at 5:00 PM in evening."
,,Great in the morning,5.0,,We stayed with friends who live close by and this place is out of the world. True rainforest and lake in the middle of a modern city. Don't go too early wait till sunrise. Keep 3 hours to enjoy the trails.
,,Reservoir - Nice Place for a walk or run,4.0,,Review by Dr Sim. Reservoir. Nice Place for a walk or run in the early morning or the early evening. Cooler. Do not be there too late at night. Tourists can take a walk if they have time. Regards DrSim001
,,Good for jogging. Not recommend for tourist,4.0,,"good for jogging and rowing. It's peaceful and spaceful. However, not much to see for a tourist. I like it while not much chance to go as a bit far from my place"
,,Shady walking path even middle of the day,5.0,,"The place is well-taken care and tree cover most of the walking pass to protect us from the heat.
It is a narrow path but people can path both ways.
It is a popular spot for many joggers and who enjoy the greenery.

Just be aware that there are some monkeys around and we are not allowed to feed them."
,,"can go kayak in the reservoir, very relaxing",4.0,,"It only take about 15 min from Novena, the reservoir is clean, and can rent a kayak for 15 S$ per hour, including life jacket. It was relaxing that there weren't so many people kayaking there. Better to bring clothes and shorts with you cause you'll get wet."
,,A must-see visit for a nature walker or a trail runner...,5.0,,"I'm guilty on both accounts, I enjoy outdoors and love running on trails wherever I can... So, before coming to Singapore I did a little online reading on best places to run. The MacRitchie Reservoir came up quite a few times, so I had to go and check it out...

The closest place to enter the park, if arriving via public transport, is from the Marymount MRT station and walking about fifth of a mile to reach the proper park entry via underpass under the MacRitchie Viaduct.

The trail is well marked by signs and distance markers. It's approx. 11 kilometers long. I ran in the proper, counter-clockwise direction, which is also easier. It starts with a few kilometers of rougher, sometimes hard-packed, sometimes looser, undulating gravel path. It can be quite muddy after rain. If you are lucky, you get to see some wildlife, too. I've encountered monkeys and lizards. The most of the trail is shaded from direct sunlight. About halfway through, you will pass by the Jelutong Tower, have a break in your run, climb it and enjoy the above tree views. Past the tower, it gets flatter and more open, the trail ground also becomes more wider, either dirt, or wood, or pavement path. You get to enjoy the views of nearby private golf grounds and the reservoir itself.

You will see plenty of runners, so it is hard to get lost, but you still can run by yourself surrounded by the tropical forest. I started my run at 5pm on Monday... Two hours should be plenty, even if you are a slow runner.

I absolutely recommended to jog around the reservoir, you'll love it, no matter the heat and humidity, just carry a small hand towel to wipe your sweat;)

PS: If you only want to stop by for quick views, enter in the same place, from the Marymount MRT station, the easternmost spot on the trail, and just walk left from there, or clockwise, for easy, flat 1-2 kms around the southern edge of the reservoir. You can then exit at the car park and walk toward Caldecott MRT station via Thomson Road to get back to downtown."
,,green patch in the midst of city concrete jungle..,5.0,,"good trails for small and long treks. suitable for all age groups. amazing place to relax, rejuvenate and unwind ... if u r too stressed out after hard week at work,"

,,Great walk,5.0,,"This is a great walk, with a number of options available, depending on your time constraints and fitness level.
If you decide to go around the whole reservoir and include the tree top walk, 3hrs is a reasonable amount of time to put aside, longer if you have kids on tow.
Bring water and hats for the unshaded areas, and keep all loose items secured as the monkeys will take them b4 you know it.
A beautiful walk with some lovely views, this is a great way to spend some time."
,,"A hot slog through tropical forest, keep your eyes open lest you miss the fauna",4.0,,"This could be a boring, hot, and unrewarding hike for someone coming halfway across the globe but for some easily overlooked critters. On my hike, I was fortunateto encounter a pit viper perched on a tree limb next to the trail, as well as a forest roach that looked like a leaf. A few monkeys rounded out my experience."

We enjoyed the walking trails around the reservoir, lots of variety and easy grades everywhere. Use your time in the reservoir park to work up your appetite for the many foods Singapore has to offer!"
,,Only if you are a outdoor person.,4.0,,"Its a nature place right in the middle of the country. You have nature trials for you to hike and the reservoir has kayak for you to rent and do kayaking and fishing. If you are really into hiking, you can hike from this place to Bukit Timah Hill. Nearest MRT station is Caldecott or Marymount, about 15 minutes walk to this place."
,,Jungle in the city,5.0,,"Don't miss a walk there and go in the top three walk . The walk (yellow ) is 11km and is moderate difficult , but there are many walk even with less km. Lots of monkey , birds, .....close to you during the walk .
Recommended to have water (many bottles) with you .

,,Nature Trail,5.0,,"If you love nature, this is one place you should not miss. You can canoe here. There are various trails for good tracking and jog. There is also a nice treetop walk. Suitable for family. Nice place for a picnic."
,,"Nature, nature, nature",5.0,,"If you're fond of the outdoors and nature, this place is worth a visit, more than once. Bring your lunch and have a picnic. The day we visited it was a bit overcast. Rain had fallen some hours before so it was nice and cool. We went early in the morning so it wasn't that crowded, but as we were leaving around 9:00 am there were lots of people. You can watch the people canoeing in the water or walk through the nature trail. I didn't have appropriate footwear for the trail so didn't venture too far in. But would definitely return to a little trekking or jogging."
,,Nice nature for a peace of mind,4.0,,"It was a very nice place for anyone who wish to get close to nature and enjoy the day with love one. Many love couple visiting the place for 'honeymoon' like experience. We love it and come often sometime walking, sometime jogging... cool place."

i have been few times with the kids that love it cause of the animals and the great walks...
recommended on sunny days.. be careful on rainy times... get a bit scary for kids.."
,,Beautiful walk and photos,4.0,,For a relaxing walk and a spot of fishing in the centre of Singapore this is lovely. Get your fishing gear on Beach Road and head over to chat with the locals. Bring and hat and sunscreen and some water. Great for nature and animal spotting. Just watch out for the flying golf-balls.
,,A restful place in the middle of Singapore.,4.0,,When you visit you forget that you are in the heart of Singapore. Children love the experience. A visit gets you away from the hustle of the day to day life on the island.
,,Feel the nature,5.0,,Great experience. Wear a comfortable foot wear. Bring a small bag for your water. Reaching the tree top was awesome. Plastic bags are not advisable to carry as it attracts the monkey.
,,Favourite running place,5.0,,Really glad that MacRitchie Reservoir park has maintained its nature element. Running the different trails around here always keep me refreshed and the trail running is something quite hard to find in Singapore.
,,Awesome park!,5.0,,"You have to go here if you love the outdoors. most exciting spot in singapore, which is otherwise a pretty safe (leaning on boring) place."

,,Exploration,5.0,,Excellent place to burn off last night's dinner. What a way to see nature. Lots of Wildlife along the way. Trails all around the Reservoir.
,,Great day out,5.0,,"This is an amazing place. A vast reservoir with circular walks totally some 12 km but you can do parts of the walk. You start around a large lake then go int a jungle path then over board walks. Not forgetting an area with wild monkeys but they are fine as long as you dont have food in your hands, in which case they will take it from you. All good fun though. If your doing the fall circuit start early or after say four pm to avoid the heat."
,,Nice long walk in the undergrowth with butterflies fluttering about your feet,4.0,,"The walk around MacRitchie Reservoir is a long one that can take up to 6 hours to complete when done leisurely and including the tree top walk. If the walk itself gets boring there's wildlife about to keep one occupied including the butterflies, dragonflies, monkeys. Please remember not to feed to monkeys and follow the park rules. Also an educational experience for everyone with many information plaques positioned throughout the trail!"
,,Prunus Trail is suitable for beginners,4.0,,"Prunus trail is a short walk of about 1h from main entrance (loop). It is an easy walk with very little steps. Half the trail is on broadwork and the other is on a stone path.

You must keep any plastic bags or water bottles in your bag. The monkeys are very aggressive and would jump at your bag to snatch your bottle from the side pockets.

There is a small store with basic snacks and a japanese restaurant in the reservoir."
,,a beautiful place for a stroll with the family,4.0,,"Pack your hats, wear your sunscreen, and carry a water bottle as you go for a stroll through the spacious park lands surrounding MacRitchie Reservoir.
The park has multiple bus stops close by, and is an easy walk for people of all fitness levels.
Make sure you go for a stroll along the boardwalk into the forest to see if you can spot some monkeys.
My kids loved spotting the turtles, and watching some local school students kayaking on the water."
,,Walk by the Waters,3.0,,A nice place to go for a stroll. Popular place for joggers. Sometimes they have performances there as well.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"Perfect views, scenic beauty, calm and relaxing. What more can I say? I you want to get refreshed, visit this place."
,,a perfect place for family to visit on a weekend picnic,4.0,,a very nice place to spend half a day as a picnic spot with family. easily accessible by public transport.
,,Favourite reservoir in Singapore,5.0,,"MacRitchie reservoir is hands down my favourite reservoir in Singapore -- with many nature trails, a large area for kayaking, a treetop walk, and even a golf course, there are activities for everyone, and walks of all lengths to suit your schedule. Just beware of the monkeys!"
,,Wonderful hiking place,5.0,,"Always check the weather forecast before going there. Be prepared with proper footwear as some places can be quite muddy and slippery. Bring water bottle, mosquito repellant and sunblock (raincoat just in case!)"
,,Gorgeous Oasis,5.0,,"A gorgeous oasis in the midst of Singapore city! Definitely worth visiting for nature-lovers. Quite a few beautiful walks and hikes. The water...the rainforest... the sounds of nature.... This was indeed my most refreshing and rejuvenating day in Singapore (despite the fact it's also the day I got sunburned the most and perspired to levels of my clothing soaking).

The Treetop Walk was nice, not just for the Treetop suspension bridge, but also for the actual walk there. One could walk from the main Lornie Road Macritchie Reservoir entrance, or from the Venus Road entrance (which would be the shorter route). I used the Lornie Road entrance and quite enjoyed the longer walk.

On my way to the reservoir, my taxi-driver was just plain amazed and surprised to hear my destination...and then he just continued to literally laugh out loud at my choice of destination!!! :) He insisted that ""only joggers go there"" and laughed that I ""must be a very good jogger""! He then continued to dish out the touristy spots to me, telling me ""usually people go to Gardens by the Bay, or Botanic Gardens, or the zoo...""!!! ""Are you sure you still want to go to Macritchie??"" Hehehehehehe, it was a hilarious trip - especially so for him, as he couldn't stop laughing :)) He even wished me good luck when he dropped me off!!!

I'd probably trade a day at Sentosa for a day at Macritchie, anytime :)"
,,Escape the crowds,5.0,,"If you are an Expat in Singapore and need a rest from city crowds and noise, look no further than MacRitchie Reservoir/Park.

There are fantastic walks or runs here to while a day away, along with an assortment of animals and birds.

A real Oasis in Singapore"
,,A quiet and serene palce for a few hours walk,4.0,,A popular place with some nice quiet corners to hide a away. The path round the lake is decent and gives you the impression at times of being outside Singapore's concrete jungle.
,,amazing place in Singapore,5.0,,"Can't believe that there's a kind of place which is truly natural in Singapore.Many people think that there're only concrete jungle in this city but they're totally wrong!! This place can guarantee all tourists that there are nice,pleasant jungle in the city.Moreover, there's an amazing free-standing suspension bridge among this forest. I can tell you that I was quite impressed by this place a lot.

If you are a person who love hiking and explore nature.You shouldn't miss this place!!!"
,,Old world charm,5.0,,"Yes one can see the thinking that went into this area. While the iron works speak of a craftsmanship not often seen today the practicality and the natural landscaping of this preserve and reservoir is second to none. Bring the family, a hat and some water."
,,"Good place to exercise, relax or just chill away from the busy town",5.0,,"We always do a 10 km trail run here with my friends. I see people also taking their walks here. The place gives you like forest adventure ambiance. The tree top hill view is a definitely a place to see when you are here. It has a hanging bridge which gives you a different view of Singapore, that its not just all tall buildings, condos and HDBs."
,,"Lovely area, but some problems for the disabled",4.0,,"Over the years we’ve visited quite a few times. Love the scenery, and a rare chance in Singapore to see rainforest.
This time we came on a Sunday, and found everything very crowded. Both café and toilets were adequate for the visitors, but paths were difficult. The park was fine, but the walk into the forest was difficult. Seeing any wildlife was hopeless with so many people around.
We enjoyed a tasty reasonably priced lunch at the café, service was quick, and we always eat there.
We wanted to walk the Prunus boardwalk, but it was rather narrow, and had no handrail. With a number of uneven boards, we both felt nervous, and soon decided to leave. This will only affect those with disabilities; I’m sure healthy visitors can cope, I’ve always been able to do the walk in the past.
It’s still a great place to visit. But if you’re disabled and struggle with uneven surfaces, then come on weekdays when it’s quiet (so you don’t constantly have people trying to pass you), or just enjoy the park, and don’t follow the trail around the lake.
To get there, take a bus or taxi from the city. Leaving by bus is more difficult, because the buses are on the opposite side of a busy road, you have to use a bridge with lots of steps to reach them. Again, only a problem for the disabled.
It makes a great change from the city, and a good opportunity to see the more rural side of Singapore.
I wouldn't rate is as a 'must see' attraction for overseas visitors if short on time. But it's well worth it for those who have the time."
,,Excellent Scenic place for some physical activity,5.0,,"Went on weekend Saturday morning and place was crowded with lots of people jogging, running or simply taking a walk. There were Kayaking lessons going on. One can see beautiful mist while walking on tracks. Excellent place."
,,A haven of peace in Singapore,5.0,,"Well worth taking a taxi from your hotel if you have a half-day to spare. This is about 20 minutes by taxi from Orchard Road. There is no nearby MRT station. This is a delightful way to stretch your legs after a long flight or before you leave Singapore.

You soon leave the bustle of the city behind and walk into a mature green forest with a range of woodland walks, from very short to 11 kms. The reservoir looks much more like a large natural lake than an artifice because the waterline follows the contours of the land and the trees are tall and crowded (mostly secondary forest but some primal).

At the entrance, there is a small restaurant serving simple food and toilets. Use these before you set off on a long walk, because the next toilet is one or two hours walk, depending on whether you walk round the lake anti-clockwise (one) or clockwise (two). Take a water bottle too, because there is little shelter on the route and the climate is very humid. Don't even start walking if thunderstorms are possible, because you will be exposed to falling trees and lightning. Take sturdy shoes or trainers, because while some of the path is a boardwalk, other parts are rough forest with exposed tree roots.

Monkeys are everywhere, which is charming provided you don't carry bags that look like food. Males are especially aggressive, so take a stick with you to warn them off. You might meet a monitor lizard on your path, which look more fearsome than they are at up to 3 metres long. I once had a snake cross my path too and birds and butterflies add their own beauty to the walk.

Allow 2.5 hours brisk walking to complete the longest walk or more if you stop to admire the many lovely sights. In all, it is a real tonic for the eyes and lungs if you have been too long downtown."
,,"A very hot hike, but worth it!",5.0,,"There are many trails around the MacRitchie Reservoir - one will bring you to the Tree Top Bridge. It is a very lush and green experience, best done on weekdays since there are no crowds. Remember to bring water since it will be a very hot hike through the rainforest and around the lake."
,,Nature in the backyard of the city,5.0,,A tranquil virgin rainforest. Good place for short walk and take in the tranquil view of the lake and nature. For the more sporty they can enjoy a goo walking trail around the nature reserve.
,,Close to nature,5.0,,"I come here whenever I can, to feel close to nature. Cleanses my soul. You almost don't see any buildings. Just clear sky, trees and the occasional monkeys, fishes, birds, squirrels and big lizards."
,,Great place when you are sick of concrete,3.0,,"I often go to Singapore for extended periods, and this is one of my favourite places to go when I want some relative peace and quiet and nature. Lots of exotic animals if you are lucky. Monkeys, monitor lizards etc. It is a big walk/run around a lake. Can be quite crowded on weekends with families. As always with Singapore a reasonable restaurant at the start. Make sure you go early in the morning as it becomes very hot as the day wears on. (By Singapore nature standards I give this more stars, BTW). For somewhat more out of the way places try ﻿Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, or ride a bike on Pilau Ubin."
,,A must do activity,5.0,,"The entire trail is long, over 10 KM, so be prepared if you plan on walking the entire way as there are no short cuts. The bridge is worth the walk and usually will see monkeys among other wildlife."
,,"Green lungs of Singapore, and a peaceful haven",4.0,,"Second visit to this reservoir, however you must note you cannot walk around the whole reservoir as they are repairing some of the walkways. We saw plenty of monitor lizards, monkeys, kingfishers, purple heron, although no snakes!"
,,Pleasant walk at MacRitchie Reservoir,4.0,,"My daughter and I took the MRT and a short walk to MacRitchie Reservoir last week. The spot is beautiful, with easy boardwalk access for a gentle stroll, or a more demanding Nature Trail. Plenty of local flora to see, and lots of outdoor activities (fishing, kayaks, outdoor gym etc)"
,,Just besutiful,5.0,,Amazing. How can this be in the middle of a city. Fabulous views. Plenty of monkeys and lizards. Well worth a visit. Take water with you to drink as you walk!
,,Lovely greenery and water in the centre of Singapore,4.0,,"It's slightly difficult to believe that you are near the centre of Singapore in this little oasis. There are lots of walking trails, many through light woodlands, so you do get shade away from the heat. There are also more open walks too, although I couldn't get around the reservoir when I went at the end of January, as they are repairing the footpath clockwise from the Reservoir Road car park (south -east corner of the park) to the Jelutong Tower (northeast). That would have been a long walk, around 11km.

You can rent kayaks too, go anti-clockwise from the carpark for 300m, open mornings and afternoons."
,,Always visit,4.0,,"I go there to exercise. It is spacious, peaceful, give you options how far you want to run. Canoeing is quite popular for families with young kids. Often see people fishing too. On weekends the park is quite busy. Generally serious runners go early. After 9 am, family and friends of all ages start their walks. If you do run, make sure you wear good running shoes and be careful about the uneven ground. You can do any distance up to 20km (or more if to Bukit Timah). Bathrooms available for quick shower. Lockers available too. The scenery is always beautiful during sun rise or sun set."
,,Best for sunset walks.,5.0,,"The boardwalks can have such a calming effect that is much needed for the people who are feeling the stress from the hectic daily life. I love the environment and the people who goes there. It is a place where you can feel at ease in nature.

However, do beware of holding water bottles or food in your hands as the monkeys may snatch it away from you."
,,"Get , set , Go !",5.0,,Perfect place for a bright and active day in Singapore . Love the lush greens and boardwalks around the place !
,,Super walk along the boardwalk,5.0,,"Walked along this wooden boardwalk, running alongside the water, right to the end. Despite hearing traffic nearby and overlooked by high buildings you still feel close to nature. I've done this nice level walk a couple of times and each time I've seen the monkeys come down to the waters edge, terrapins and a large lizard type creature in the reservoir, along with a snake and land lizards nearby. You can easily take a pushchair for the little ones and there are benches with nature information boards to read about the surroundings. Could do with a refreshment stall somewhere along it, but no big problem. We stopped at the cafe for a drink by the dam, before setting of. All this nature and for free."
,,Avoid going during middle of day,3.0,,Try going early in the morning just as the sun rises to avoid the heat. Don't bring any plastic bags or food as the monkeys will attack you for them (saw this happen).
,,Morning work-out,5.0,,Awesome place to jog and brisk walk in the morning ! Highly recommend to come on weekdays as it be lesser noise n crowd. You can canoe or kayak if you are keen. Nice place for everyone who love the nature !
,,Good run!,4.0,,Went to the reservoir to have a walk and the feeling was amazing. Peaceful and serene surroundings. Nature at its best!
,,Great place to sweat,5.0,,"The place is quite big..the trail for jogging or running is about 6 km..the air and environment is so pure..love it very much..there are also several spot that were provided for working out..there's a park for taichi..a lot of space for water sport such as canoeing..there are several cafe providing breakfast and also beers in the afternoon..
You can reach this place by bus..no 162 or 167 from Orchard area for about SGD 1.60.."
,,3.5/5,3.0,,"Came here for a walk with my fiancée to start off our year, we decided this place cos of our curiosity with the location, turns out to be quite a nice place!

Scenery: 3.5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Cleanliness: 3.5/5
Physical Ease: 3/5
Fun: 3/5

Our Activities:
Petai Trail: 3.5/5

The Good: Nature, the sights and the sounds, great place to catch monkeys in action if you are keen, a good place for a chillax walk.

The Bad: We thought the place can be cleaner, and the trails are quite Long. Bring more equipment along, cos it's quite a distance from the nearest amenities.

Bottom Line: We would come here again with more gear, nice place, just that there are other nicer trails that we have been to. Careful of the monkeys!"
,,Don't forget the mosquito repellent!,4.0,,"Yes, yes... like the other reviews say it IS a tranquil spot, and it has a good boardwalk for walkers and joggers alike. There are also some water sports and it is a quite popular place on weekends (even at 7am when the serious runners amass in their little groups, ready for their weekly long run).

I think MacRitchie (and its less popular neighbours - Upper Pierce and Lower Pierce reservoirs) are nicest at sundown, because that's when you feel even more attuned to nature. But beware the mosquitoes...."
,,Beautiful Resevoir,5.0,,The Macritchie Resevoir is a beautiful park. There is a walk by the lake on thin wooden planks. If you are lucky you may be able to see an animal or two crawling out of the neighbouring forest. The lake is not very deep and the water is clear enough for you to see the bottom. Despite the weather the walk is actually quite cool.
,,Anoth oasis in Singapore,5.0,,"Interesting area in Singapore if you want respite from the crowds.

I hired a car with driver to take me round the island and this was one of the spots I was taken and it is very pretty.
Take an unbrella for protection from the sun as it is quite open."
,,Beautiful and Tranquil,5.0,,"A wonderful place for scenic run, walk or just to chill with family, friends and love ones. Nature lovers will find this the ideal place to enjoy the tranquility and greenery. I enjoy the trail run around 6km and look forward to the scenery and fun each time. Highly recommend place for nature lovers!"
,,loved it!,5.0,,A really lovely place to get away from it all. If you want a walk in greenery then this is the place. Just to chill and get away from the constant noise of the city.
,,Full of Tranquility,4.0,,"Have been going for a long walk with friends at least twice a month at McRitchie Reservoir Park.
Weekday walks will be best if you enjoy the peace and serenity of the trails. You can enjoy the 'natural music' coming from the surtounding habitats. The rustling of the trees, the birds chirping, the monkeys chattering.

If you plan to reach the tree top bridge, it's best to put on your most comfortable walking shoes. Distance from the entrance is about 7km with some elevation. It took us about 1.5 hours to reach the tree top.

Bring a water bottle to hydrate yourself along the way. Else you can have your drinks and light meals after the hike at Mushroom Cafe, located near the carpark."
,,MacRitchie Reservoir,4.0,,Wonderful place to go to for a walk. Suitable for families to visit. Very well designed with toilets at many locations.
,,A great park in Singapore,5.0,,"MacRitchie is my favourite go-to place in Singapore. Great for family walks, play and chill as well individual walks alongside majestic Reservoir or in forest area or on the board walk along water. Children just love the walk on the board.

There are also two lovely restaurants. One serves regular meals whereas other is exotic cuisine overlooking the reservoir."
,,Good reservoir for handout with friends,5.0,,"Usually go there for running training. Have a 10KM off road trail which provides picturesque and serene fresh environment for walk in the lush green and shady trail. The path way covers muddy, wooden, gravel and tarmac. On the way of the loop there is a ranger station where you can refill water and have rest room."
,,Very nice but....,3.0,,"My friend took me here for a walk with his dog. Beautifully maintained and very natural BUT as a dog lover, very disappointed to see keep his dog on the lead. Surely areas can be designated for dogs to run free?"
,,Very Good Reservoir,4.0,,I really love the MacRitchie Reservoir! It is full of beautiful animals and they have a great Park! But to do the Tree Top walk it takes 6 hours which is unacceptable.
,,Path Closed so Extra Distance Required,4.0,,"Magnificent scenic spot in the city. Wonderful walks in the lish tropical forests or along the boardwalk next to the water. The Treetops trail is a sturdy 5km walk to reach - dont underestimate the time or effort required. I planned the 11km circular route only to discover after 4km thatbthe path is closed until end April 2017. I retraced my 4km and then had to do the 5km to the Tree Tops Trail, effectively doubling the distance. To top it all, I took a wrong turn ending up at the Tower which i had earlier decided was too far. So I ended up very tired at the end of the day, but satisfied that I had really enjoyed MacRitchie."
,,Scenic running route,5.0,,"-surrounded by flora and fauna during my morning run -loves the uneven track, makes it challenging - Has refreshments nearby"
,,Canoe rides for the kids,4.0,,"Came here again today for another visit and this time decided to hire a canoe at $15 for the hour. Unfortunately there's only a small part of the reservoir which is permitted for canoes (as distinct from more serious kayakers), but it was still good fun and the kids seemed to like the experience. It's worth bringing a change of clothes as you do end up quite wet."
,,"A Lovely, Soothing Attraction",5.0,,"It is an amazing place to connect with Nature. Very soothing. Very relaxing. Also, a good place to get away from everything, not to mention, excersize. I would highly recommend it here!"
,,Amazing place to take a break from the city life!,5.0,,We walked from Lornie Road and inside the park on the trail around the reservoir... Spotted the popular 4-legged snake as well. A very peaceful place! It's a must-go place if you have good weather and a couple of hours at hand!
,,"Best Place to Run, Ever",5.0,,"MacRitchie Reservoir has been my favourite place for some trail-running since a few years back, as you get good views while running, and there are many trails you can choose from when you run. For those who do not fancy running, you can simply take a long walk there, and hike up to the TreeTop walk, which is really popular with couples, family and friends. Highly recommended if you're here for a holiday!"
,,Awesome morning spot to enjoy nature,5.0,,"Awesome little patch to spend the early morning surrounded by wild wetland and forest birds, plantain squirrel, macaques and Malayan water monitors."
,,Nice Place to Chill and Get Away from city,5.0,,This is a huge nature reserve as well as a reservoir and is suitable for both young and old to enjoy. There's walking trail as well and a few eateries and restaurants.
,,Excellent day out,5.0,,"Lovely day out, got to see some wildlife and go on the trail. Good exercise, would recommend taking a big bottle of water."
,,wonderful walk,5.0,,I took the nature trail loop and it was a wonderful experience. It was lovely and quiet all throughout; a wonderful urban escape with wonderful views of nature. It was refreshing to see fallen leaves and to feel them underfoot.
,,Beautiful place for run and walk,4.0,,Beautiful place for run and walk. But take note of the monkeys.. Can get rowdy and aggressive at times. Avoid them
,,MUST GO,4.0,,"Scenic Reservoir& Park. You can spend half a day here walking around the reservoir. There are monkeys around too, be prepared to take a lot of photos.

Transportation here is convenient as there is a bus stop right Infront of the reservoir. The bus stop is conveniently named MacRitchie Reservoir. Don't try to walk to the reservoir from the mrt though, it's a 15 minutes walk from Caldecott MRT and a 25 minutes walk from Toa Payoh MRT in hot weather."
,,Had some of my most memorable walks here,5.0,,"Do not go in the weekend, it just gets too crowded. But do go on an early morning during the week. The boardwalk will take you about one hour along the waterside, with turtles, fish and the occasional big monitor lizard swimming by."
,,Awesome~,4.0,,"It's a beautiful place.
It's free to access.
You should not have to worry about hot weather and sunshine because the place have plenty of tall trees like a jungle.
You can observe wild monkeys and birds.

맥리치공원 호수는 사실 런닝 연습하러 오는 사람들이 많이 옵니다.
주말에도 이른 시간부터 입구 휴게실같은 곳에 사람들이 모여있는 있습니다.

휴게실 안쪽에 물품 보관함 유료로 이용하실 수 있구요. 안에서 마실 물과 핸드폰 정도만 들고 가시구요~
먹을거는 들고 있으면 야생 원숭이들이 다가와 공격성을 띨 수 있기에 안 들고 가시는게 좋다고 허네요~

트레일을 따라가는 숲속에는 화장실이 거의 없어서 출발전 휴게실에서 미리 다녀오시는게 좋아요~

기본 짧은 구간이 걷기 2시간에서 4시간 이상 걸립니다~ 대부분 런닝 구간도 2시간 정도 예상 하셔야 합니다~

즐거운 추억과 즐거운 여행 되세요~ ^.~"
,,Idyllic,5.0,,"MacRitchie Reservoir is my favourite place in Singapore. There are several routes, so plan ahead. If you want to go to Treetop, you should check the route because it is one way. Bring plenty of water, mosquito repellent and wear comfortable shoes. Enjoy!"
,,"Walks, Exercise or Meditation",5.0,,"This is a lovely place for walks with the family or alone. Also it is a splendid place for hikes, running or a mere meditative walk. The natural surrounding has been well kept and worthwhile place for relaxing."
,,Excellent,5.0,,There are many reservoirs in Singapore . This is one of them . They have built a bridge in a zig zag way on the lake and beautified the surroundings .thus a nice place to relax and picnic .
,,Energetic,4.0,,"Great walk, can't believe this exists in the middle of Singapore. Beautiful, well kept, interesting, well maintained with great information for all ages. My girls aged 9 and 11 and my friends girls aged 6, 9 and 10 did the 12 km walk on a hot day and coped fine. Well worth the exercise and fresh air!"
,,"Best Natural walk, pleasant forest",4.0,,"Best Natural walk, pleasant forest, nice walking path ending with HSBC tree walk. Best place to avoid the busy singapore city life."
,,Great place to escape this busy Singapore!,5.0,,"Tucked away in the center of Singapore, this is a great place to observe little wild life (birds, tortoise, insects?). Treetop walks are amazing, and trekking is easy. For the dragon-boating enthusiast, there is options for you to do that as well."
,,Nature Heals,4.0,,"It is a very nice place to escape from a city life and you don't have to worry about the heat or the sun since you can walk most of it under the shades too... We are lucky to live just across this place so we can go there as often as we like.

The trees, the water, the wildlife here just calm you... Nature heals..."
,,Review of McRitchie park,5.0,,"If you are serious of workout this is the place to visit in Singapore, go any time of the day and you will walk in tree shade. Complete round of Tree top walk is about 13 Km and may take about 3 to 4 hrs. Its gravel road all the way so will need good shoes. Enjoy nature while walking."
,,My hideaway place - a few minute from city life,5.0,,"MacRitchie is another one of my favorite place while I lived in Singapore. It's a perfect hideaway place to free up my mind from city life, to be close to the nature, and to have a good walk (3 hours plus) by just a few minute from my condo. MacRitchie was my first place to restart my hiking activities, which I have lost. MacRitchie was also the training place for my South East Asia trekking journey during my time in Singapore.
I would recommend anyone to spend time there. It will be a 3 hour walk to cover the whole trail. You will be impressed by the tree top walk including many plants along the way. My normal walk started from 7:00AM until 10:00AM to complete the walk. Then, I took the MRT to enjoy big local foods brunch without feeling too much guilty. Don't miss this place. It's another best part of Singapore."
,,A whole lot of nature,4.0,,"This Reservoir makes for a very enjoyable outing.
I walked/ran around the whole reservoir 11km and it took me 3hours. I did stop to take photos a fair bit.
I wouldn't recommend walking the whole track if you are on vacation as it leaves you pretty exhausted for the rest of the day.
There are signs with maps the whole way letting you know where you are and shows you the different trails and where they lead.

I would recommend starting at MacRitchie Nature trail (on Google Maps) which is a 5 minute walk from Marymount train station on the Circle line. I saw a bunch of monkeys chilling near the water which was really cool. Head straight, along the path by the water.
After about 20 minutes of walking, you'll eventually get to a board walk. Head along that until it ends. You can then head back the direction you came on a tree-top walk.
If you do choose to continue I suggest having at least 2Litres of water each and you can refill at the Rangers station around the half way mark.

I saw plenty of lizards, a snake, squirrels, and monkeys.
If you do see monkeys, make sure you have plastic bags and food hidden from them.
It's against the law to feed them."
,,Peaceful with Great Trails and Monkeys!,5.0,,"This is a terrific place to explore and view beautiful flora, lakes and wildlife.

Bring mosquito spray inasmuch as Zika is in Singapore.

I arrived via rented motorcycle but you may need a taxi or bus to the area.

It's great to see the ""outback"" of this beautiful country!"
,,Magikap,5.0,,"We went there for Pokemon hunting. Loads of Magikap! Aside from that, it was quite a walk. We walked over 25 thousand steps that day!"
,,Must visit when in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a beautiful idyllic place to visit when in Singapore. It is accessible by bus or taxi. There is a small cafe there and toilets/showers too if needed. The loop around the reservoir is around 10km and under tree cover for most of the way - good for runners and walkers alike. There is a small ranger station halfway around where you can get drinking water and use the toilet. There are also other trails which connect and take you to Bukit Timah and the zoo for the more adventurous. It can get quite busy at weekends so weekdays might be a better option if you have the choice, either way don't leave Singapore without visiting!"
,,Central Park,5.0,,"MacRitchie Reservoir is a great place for the whole family. There are loads of walking paths, a restaurant and possibility to go kayaking. It really doesn't feel like you are in the middle of the city!"
,,Great family activity,4.0,,"It was a decent hike for the family. Not as difficult as its website claims but distance-wise it is quite decent. Need to bring lots of water and change of clothes. In spite of the shades, it can still get quite warm and sticky after a while. Need to beware of the wild monkeys as they can creep out of nowhere and try to grab your food! Tree Top Walk is super nice!"
,,Hiking n picnic place,5.0,,A wonderful place to hike or cycle or even escooter .. beautiful view n feel of a forest and wonderful Reservoir view.. A excellent place to spend morning if you do not to do regular touristy stuff..
,,Treetop walk was great,5.0,,"The one-way only tree top canopy walk was remarkable - avoid bringing food and plastic bag with you, as the monkeys around can notice this and come to you making too much disturbance."
,,I liked it a lot,4.0,,I love this place simply bcs I love nature and this has forestry feelings and yea it was good. The place itself is really big and relaxing. The roads are really well taken care of and it was an easy climb but need a lot of endurance
,,"Wonderful Trail, Pleasant Walk",5.0,,"This is a really great walk. You can decide which trail you want to do in advance based on your fitness. We did the 11km walk to the tree top walk and back. It is mostly shaded but some sections are very open and sunny so wear sunnie, hat and suncream. Also put on aeroguard. Bring a bottle of water. There are 2 spots along the way where you can refill water as well as toilets. There is a bus stop nearby however a taxi from the city will be about $10 depending on traffic. It took us 3.5 hours to complete at an easy pace. It is mostly level walking and no steep inclines. You do encouter animals such as monkeys, insects, lizards and snakes but keep your eyes peeled. Don't bring food but eat beforehand. If you do bring snacks, hide them. Monkeys can steal and get aggressive. Also don't carry things in a plastic bag as monkeys will rip them from you thinking there is food in there. Wear comfortable shoes. Shorts and t-shirt are fine."
,,walking in Nature,4.0,,The clear waters allow you to see the native fish and snakes in the water. The heavy thick brush on both sides of the trail provides a real connection with the animals.
,,Great walk - watch out for the monkeys!!,3.0,,"We did the whole circuit of 11+ kms. Great ""nature"" in the middle of a bustling metropolis. Walking over the bridge we came across a monkey that tried to undo a backpack and then took a swipe at me as I tried to pass. Avoid eye contact!"
,,We did the long walk - chose your trail in advance !,4.0,,We started out here and should have looked at the trail but it was a nice walk...we ended up doing about 14Km by the time we went to the treetops walk and back....Good day out but make sure you match length of walk to your fitness as we were hurting for a couple of days after !
,,One of the Top3 running trails in singapore...about 11km,5.0,,"Everytime I am in singapore, I do this run on a weekend and I still love it so much. At 7 in the morning its already busy, but not too busy. To see monkeys, dark green... being the jungel... so nice. Bring a SGD coin for the locker, leave a towel and ur private belongings and enjoy this beautiful singaporean sports escape... sooooo nice."
,,A nice national park,5.0,,We are based in Singapore. Thus park is a nice park for a relaxing and easy trail. Recommended to business travelers or families to come enjoy a piece of nature in Singapore.
,,A great place for hiking and wildlife,5.0,,"The nature trails around the MacRitchie Reservoir are a great place to have a walk in the countryside in Singapore. It's also a good place to see wildlife - I saw lots of Macaques, birds (if you start early enough in the day), fish, monitors, skinks and a water monitor. The treetop walk is good, and the Jelutong tower is worth going to to see more views across the top of the forest and Singapore. The best bit is possibly the Chemperai trail, a boardwalk on the Southern side of the reservoir.
Googling ""chemperai trail macritchie pdf"" will get you the leaflet for the reservoir showing the trails. I started at Marymount MRT at the Eastern end and walked the MacRitchie trail to the treetop walk, the track to the Jelutong tower and then back down the West side of the lake and back to Marymount. It was a great morning, but you do need to remember to take lots of water - I didn't have enough, and I was really glad of the water fountains at the Peirce Track to refill water bottles. It did feel like a long walk in the heat, but it was really great."
,,Awesome for hiking and seeing wildlife up close and personal! :),4.0,,"MacRitchie Reservoir is great for hiking with family and friends or by yourself. You are very likely to encounter macaques up close along the way and even a few monitor lizards. The TreeTop Walk (usually open between 9am to 5pm) is one of the highlights and offers a breathtaking view high up in the trees.

There are wooden boardwalks and stairs throughout MacRitchie Reservoir, which makes it easy to hike through even in rainy conditions. Bottled water, sensible walking shoes and mosquito repellent are must-haves. I was walking with some scientist friends and we caught a mosquito that was about to snack on one of us to identify what species it was and whether it was the dengue transmitting type (thankfully it was not!). Make sure you top up applications of mosquito repellent every few hours.

Around 2 to 3 hours is sufficient to cover a full circuit of the place including a visit to the TreeTop Walk. Kayaking and canoeing activites are also on offer around the lake area. MacRitchie Reservoir itself is free to enter and is a definite visit for hiking and wildlife lovers! :)"
,,Great place for a trail run,5.0,,Great place for a 10 km trail run. Watch for snakes and monkeys they can be troublesome at times. Several trails from flat to hilly.
,,Beautiful place!,4.0,,"It's our 2nd time in Singapore and we was suggested this place for hiking! The place is beautiful and breathtaking! The hike is a good one, not too challenging. Love the tree top walk especially!"
,,One of the best jewel of Singapore,5.0,,Great for family outing specially for nature lovers. Beautiful 10km running 🏃 trial around reservoir
,,pretty good,4.0,,"pretty good neat little reservoir with some birds and some fish, leisure day time activity to be enjoyed"
,,A walk into nature!,5.0,,"Walking into the Mcritchie trail is like walking into nature. I had a solo walk into the sorrunding woods of this place. Ii is a memorable experience, and the hanging bridge is a highlight."
,,Beautiful sanctuary in a city,5.0,,"This is one of the few places you can go in Singapore and feel like you might just be alone for a minute. With wildlife, trees and water, it is a great place to get outside and get some exercise. Highly recommended"
,,Feeling of outside,5.0,,MacRitchie Reservoir is the best place to have a break with Singapore cosmopolite athmosphere. 12km walk better to do in the morning !
,,Excellent,4.0,,A good workout and excellent way to enjoy a different perspective of Singapore by taking a walk round the Reservior. There are various routes with the longest about 12 km. There is a suspension bridge if you take the Tree Top walk for a good birds eye view of Reserviour.
,,A hike into the woods,4.0,,Nice and pleasant experience into one of the remaining forests in sg. Do expect what nature has in stall for you such as insects and such. Be wary of the monkeys as they may get quite aggressive.
,,a pleasant walk,4.0,,"What a lovely place to go for a walk. It can be a long walk and you can get lost, but its easy to get back on track. Take a picnic and enjoy eating around the reservoir."
,,Great trail walk near city,5.0,,"great 14km trail walk. we started from eastern end of the reservoir near St. Theresa's home around 9am, waling counterclock-wise, and finished at the mushroom cafe around 2pm. easy walking trail most of the time. but the section up to the treetop walk was very steep. would be nicer if we start earlier as it was around midday when we walked pass the golf course section, which has no shade at all.
we just found out later that if you're only interest in the treetop walk, you can access there from Venus Carpark near the intersection of Upper Thomson Rd & Sin Ming Ave."
,,One of the few nature trials in highly urbanized Singapore,4.0,,"MacRitchie Reservoir is well known as a jogging/hiking trial among locals for that coveted breath of fresh air and the experience to run within a forest (No running in Botanic gardens doesn't count as a forest...LOL).

Entrance is free and could park at the nearby carpark if you drove here. Do remember to put on your sun block and mosquito repellent before adventuring within as those critters are nasty!

If you ever get lost within the forest, stay calm and just keep a look out for the footpath and follow it to either end towards civilization. If that fails just use your mobile phone and call someone for help, I had pretty solid telco reception within the forest...hahaha.

PS: Don't feed the monkeys here as they have been known to attack people carrying food or little children who are eating food."
,,Well organized trail,5.0,,"My friends took me to MacRitchie on Saturday, and it was perfect! Right in the middle of the town, accessible by MRT. Yet it was really quite and clean. The trail was well organized and managed."
,,One of the best trails you can get in Singapore!,5.0,,"Singapore is an urban city, and there's very little trails around the heart of the city and even most of the outskirts. MacRitchie Reservoir is one of the best trails in Singapore that you can get which is free and where you can enjoy with friends and family.

They offer kayaking around the reservoir, but that depends on the weather. It is approximately 11km and it takes 2-3 hours to walk around the entire reservoir depends on how fast you walk. Make sure you bring water with you, and be careful of thieving monkeys! Near the start of the trail, there is a food place where you can get food. And of course, don't forget to visit the treetop walk (closed on Mondays, open until 5pm on the other days)!"
,,"Great park, see a different Singapore",5.0,,"This is a beautiful park about 20mins from orchard road area. Track is 11km around if you want to do the tree top walk. Definitely worth it. Just make sure you dress for the walk, it's rocky and can be slippery if it's been raining. And you will sweat. A lot. There are monkeys and I have seen a few snakes but the track is pretty well used so likely someone in front of you will deal with any surprise visitors. Very peaceful spot though, worth getting up early for a walk. Aim to be at the park around 7am just after sunrise to beat the heat. Lockers and shower facilities available too if you feel like running the 11km track."
,,Wonderful Park,4.0,,"I've been here about three or four times now, and each time has been a great experience. The sheer amount of trails that you can explore is fantastic. I would recommend the Tree Top Walk as a great place to either exercise or take a family outing. It is a long walk, though, so I might not recommend it for children. The amount of nature which you can be in while still being inside a city is great. Also, it is never crowded like many other attractions. This would be a great place to go as well if you enjoy wildlife. There are monkeys, fish eagles, various different fish species, wild orchids, and beautiful trees. I would recommend."
,,Lovely board walk,5.0,,"Great boardwalk around reservoir. Thick vegetation on one side, water the other. Grassed areas for picnics. Lots of bird life and monkeys. Do not carry plastic bags, monkeys very game and quick to take items of you. Do not feed them."
,,Beautiful area and gardens to walk around. Take an umbrella if weather changes.,4.0,,"Lovely walking area, or nice way to end a day by the water, maybe having a meal there too. Enjoyed this last year too."
,,Great hike,5.0,,Great hike considered the size of Singapore... There are several hiking routes. Tree top walk is the most popular.
,,Singapore Rainforest,5.0,,"Despite our small croweded country, if you love nature and outdoor, this is the place to visit. Walk in trees, enjoy the beauty of mother nature!"
,,Great hiking in Singapore,5.0,,"The reservoir is a historic location in Singapore and has several walking trails going around it and branching off to the Upper Pierce reservoir. The paths will take you through some well preserved secondary rainforest and you may even get to see some monkeys if you're lucky! Bring some water and keep an eye on the weather, as storms can blow in rather unexpectedly."
,,Soul searching park,5.0,,"It is suitable for every type of travelers, be it family, friends, couple or alone! It's a happening park but at the same time tranquil and peaceful. Tree top walk is worth visit g as well and it's a good exercise"
,,Walk to cherish forever,5.0,,"Situated in the heart of city , the oldest reservoir in Singapore is a natures delight.
The reservoir offers many things to suit all age groups including water sports like kayaking but the walks are the best. Lot of trails to choose from depending on your fitness. I did a long one which is first going to the treetop canopy about 5.5 Kms from car park and then julotong tower another 1 km and finally choosing to walk till Bukit Timanah nature park another 5.8 Kms. The last part was ambitious and I stuggled but then I opted for this one

Your lungs will bless you , your legs may curse you so have a good nights sleep and a steely resolve and carry a lot of water be prepared to walk with a few monkeys"
,,Great day out,5.0,,"We went here when it was overcast in Singapore not entirely sure what to expect. However, it was one of the best days of our holiday. The route is about 10km long but you wander through woodland with the occasional monkey for company. Be warned these are crafty little things and will steal your lunch box...they open them too. We also went on the tree top walk which was breathtaking, fantastic views both sides.
Great day out! And easy to get to via public transport"
,,Favorite jogging track,5.0,,The loop is 11-12 km long... Can extend with the tree too walk. Go there with daylight. Running there is great! Trekking is possible too if you have time.
,,Great hike,5.0,,"When we visit Singapore, we stay at Toa Payoh, so you can walk (about 20 mins) to McRitchie. This time I brought my 13-year old son on the ""great McRitchie reservoir"" hike, including the tree top walk, probably about 15 km all in all. It gets pretty busy at the weekends, and a surprising number of people go even during the week. Make sure to bring enough water! You can refill your bottles at the ranger station about half way."
,,Good forest nature walk,5.0,,"It is a very good 10km of forest nature walk around the reservoir. Very nice to be away from the busy urban life of Singapore. However do come prepare. While we are there, we heard a couple complaining about no water fountains, no toilets, no seats and no toilets. It seems they are expecting a tourist attraction with facilities. So be warn. This is trekking through natural forest for most part. So come prepare with water."
,,monkeys and natural forest in the middle of the city,5.0,,"great workout anytime. for asian elderly who seldom exercise, this could be too straining but you could enjoy the views of the reservoir which is pretty quiet in the morning"
,,Great hiking,5.0,,"MacRitchie reservoir is one of the best hiking locations in Singapore, a green lung for the city, with trails through secondary rain forest and boardwalks where you can see monitor lizards and terrapins. There is a ranger station with toilets and water 5km from the start and a tree top canopy walk which is free and offers excellent views over the forest"
,,Good for jogs short or long distances,3.0,,"parking easy but limited. Gravel or earth tracks, plus boardwalk good for walking or jogs. Entering the main entrance, left side leads to island country country club then loop back about 5 km. Right side if you walk 10 km or so, leads to HSBC treetop walk. Stay on main track lots of people, won't get lost. Try the boardwalk around the reservoir, it's pleasant in morning and evenings."
,,Great place to stretch your legs.,4.0,,We took a bus out and headed first for the Treetop Walk (great) before heading for the Sime Track and Jelutong Tower followed by the Lornie Trail and MacRitchie Nature Trail to circumnavigate the reservoir. Made a good afternoon's walk. Beware of the macaques if carrying food. We saw some girls with knapsacks of picnic food being mobbed by them.
,,It's Ok. I won't be hiking there.,4.0,,"There are some nature trails that get you out of the city. This is great for runners and hikers. There's a boardwalk to walk along. For me it's nothing special but it's an ok experience. I would not take visitors there. Sometimes I do like taking visitors to see the monkeys in the park. I find it annoying that people feed the monkeys and trash is scattered all over from people not disposing trash properly and there aren't large enough receptacles for trash. But the monkeys are nice to see sometimes. The park is nice. But for me, it's not a necessary place for tourists. It's a good place for locals and expats. I'm not into the nature scene so I don't go there."
,,Long trip,4.0,,"Nothing to say About the place... is pure nature . a genuine spot of Green, wild animals and green in the middle of Singapore. We had a great day, but I ve to say that if i have to find a defect in there is surely the fact that the indications inside the Park are not so clear. You do have the whole day at your disposal, because all the routes are longer than 10 km, so it will take 3,30 hours to do Only one trip and there s actually no way to reduce that. Once you start walking you cannot reduce the lenght of the trip, so can be a little bit frustrating."
,,great escape from the hustle and bustle. So easy to get to.,5.0,,"I had a day to spare so decided to take a walk in nature rather than around the malls. Best day out. MacRichie Reservoir walk is really pretty, and most of it is either within the trees, or around the lake and you can't see or hear any part of the city.
It is easy to get to: I took the MRT to Coldecutt station, and then had a 250m walk to the entrance by the dam off Lornie Road.
I then started off in an anti-clockwise direction up towards the ranger station. After a few hundred metres around the lake edge the Nature Trail headed into the trees and the next few kms were all in shade.
At the top of the park is the ranger station which offers toilets and drinking fountains. Note that other than at the bottom by the dam (where there is a food counter and vending machines) there is nowhere to buy food or water. So carry what you need.
The treetop walk is just a single span suspension bridge that gets above the tree canopy. Well constructed and solid. LOTS of stairs going up to and down from the walkway.
After completing the tree top walkway you have the choice of returning the way you came or carrying on around the lake. The second half of the walk is very pretty around the end of the lake and adjoining golf course, but much of it is exposed to the sun so make sure you bring a hat and sunscreen (and of course lots of water). Much of the complete 12km walk is on boardwalks (which are well constructed and maintained), but there are short sections of gravel path that would preclude disabled access.
All up about 12km in distance, which took about three hours. I went on a Sunday and it was busy but never obstrusive.
After returning to the Dam I took the bus to Bishan MRT."
,,Balance to Singapore's concrete jungle,5.0,,A really nice place to see some of the beautiful green space in Singapore. The walk is nicely paved with some incline and lots of flat paths. It goes without saying that Singapore is hot and so it's best to do this walk in the morning or late afternoon and always carry lots of water.
,,Nice nature spot and one of less crowded places in SG!,4.0,,"Macritchie has managed to escape tourist hit-lists so far, and manages to remain a peaceful nature spot in Singapore. Amazingly green and peaceful, its a sight to behold. Also has some good trails for weekend hikes - tree top walk is the most favorite among people."
,,Great walk,5.0,,"A full 3 hour walk to complete the full circuit around the reservoir. History of the old Singapore and how this fresh water storage started.
Careful with the free roaming monkeys as some are aggressive and a bit cheeky. One tried to steal my iPhone whilst trying to take his/her picture. Take sun block as it's very hot when out if the shade if the trees. Beware the joggers!"
,,Natural escape in the heart of the city,3.0,,"MacRitchie is a lovely place to escape urban life without having to travel far. As soon as you step onto the walking trail, the city seems a world away! There are monkeys and monitor lizards everywhere - wild and beautiful.

Make sure you bring water as it is incredibly humid in the forest and there is only one place (that I saw) to fill your bottle. Apparently there is a cafe on site but it has never been open when I've visited.

Also worth noting that once you embark on your walk there are no shortcuts or side exits so you are committed. Where comfortable shoes!"
,,Escape from the city,4.0,,Good for a run in the early morning (10km) or a walk (12km) with family. Go early to avoid the heat and crowds. Crowds in weekend normally Arrive from 10 onwards.
,,Love the green lush and peaceful pond!,5.0,,"Good place for relaxing, breathing and self-reflection. You can rent a kayak sliding in the pond in early morning or late afternoon. If it is too hot, you can walk along the walking trail to the green to avoid hot sun and enjoy sound of the water, birds and singing leaves. Great place for nature lovers!"
,,A SINGAPOREAN OASIS,5.0,,"This is a free to visit park, quiet & tranquil lovely just to roam around on a red-hot afternoon. It feels very 'English' as many of the trees were planted years ago when the British were very much at home here."
,,Nature trail,5.0,,"I visited Macritchie reservoir with my husband last Sunday. We were there to try out the nature trail, prunus trail, lornie trail and chemperai trail. It was a good walk for us, about 5+km in total, as we took our time to enjoy the greenery around us, it took us about 2.5 hours.

Do note there are a handful of joggers along the trails and sometimes there are marathon events scheduled there.

What we enjoyed most was walking along the wooden boardwalk along the reservoir, a precious feeling living in this city but yet having nature close beside you.

There is also a bistro and mushroom cafe eatery at the reservoir, do be prepared for a queue especially on weekends. The good thing is that if you need a can of 100 plus to keep you going, it only costs $1.40 per can from the cafe."
,,Great escape from the city,5.0,,"Great place to spent the day/ morning/ afternoon, away from the city center. Feels like a world away from the CBD. The network of paths make it easy to customize your experience to a preferred distance. Signs along the way make it easy to navigate.

Bring bug spray (mosquitoes!), and pay attention to the signs so you don't make a wrong turn and add a few extra k's to your outing! I especially like MacRitchie first thing in the morning, before the sun is too high and the crowds arrive."
,,Monkeys,5.0,,"A great walk around the reservoir on a board walk then a return walk along a track.
Lovely rainforest and peaceful, away from traffic noise. came across a troop of monkeys who were happy for us to spend time taking photographs and watching their babies play."
,,A nice suburban park and nature reserve,4.0,,"Worth a visit if visitors are keen to walk alongside the reservoir on a boardwalk. In some parts, one can feel the serenity rarely offered in busy Singapore. Best times to visit if one wants a cooler time is early morning or at dusk. Although it is well shaded because there are lots of trees, it can also be very humid. Just don't carry plastic bags as there are wild monkeys which may attack as they think there is food inside the bags."
,,Long and tiring,3.0,,Was going to the HSBC Tree-Top Bridge but from MacRitchie Reservoir to there is 5.4km! stop half way and walked back. Will need to stop and one of the country clubs to go to the Tree Bridge.
,,Where the rainforest touches the city.,4.0,,"This is not your average reservoir where you can walk or ride round the waters edge and over the dam, it's all of this plus fitness areas canoeing, and treks into the forest. There are also gardens to explore with two restaurants the mushroom cafe and a bistro. Check which day you go as some parts were closed on the Monday we visited. The mushroom cafe for good for light meals snacks and refresments, its open from breakfast till late.

N.B. you might encounter monkeys. If so heed the advice do not feed them, do not provoke them, slowly walk away.

We travelled there by taxi, there is parking off reservoir road, which is just off PIE junction 20 onto Lornie Road. Good bus services:- nos 52,74,93,157,165, 852,855 and the MLT CC17 station is a short walk away.

One of the trails is about 11km long, it seems to be a mixture of forest track and board walk on water's edge, cycles are not allowed on it.

Fishing is allowed in one part only.

See the website for more details of activities. And how this reservoir links to the others in the area to the north leading up to the upper seletar reservoir near the zoo."
,,Beautiful greenery in the city,5.0,,This is a great place for a breath of fresh air and respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. There is only one restaurant (a bit pricey) and a snack bar in the grounds. Bring along a picnic basket or plan to eat somewhere else.
,,MacRitchie Reservior Park Trail Running,5.0,,"On a recent trip to Singapore a friend took us on a short drive out to Singapore's MacRitchie Reservoir Park for a trail run around the reservoirs various trails.

Our friend has just begun training for a charity half marathon and is looking forward to the challenges ahead.

My Partner and I are avid trail runners and we went exploring and quickly found that there were so many trail options that you could run around for days and and still not see it all!

We saw a Malayan Water Monitor (Big Lizard) and were amazed at how dense the tropical jungle was around the Reservoir.

And all this just 15 minutes from the CBD!

The park and reservoir are one of Singapore's water catchment areas and having it open to the public for recreational use is amazing.

If you are in Singapore, it's a must see spot!"
,,Best Nature Walk in Singapore!,5.0,,"Having seen a fair bit of Singapore, I think the MacRitchie Reservoir is the best nature walk on mainland Singapore!

Accessible by bus, car or taxi, there scenery is great, it's clean and plenty of shade due to trees. The boardwalk is great fun for big and little kids alike.
Not pusher friendly, but s great day out, plenty of seats along the boardwalk, and picnic areas (be mindful of the monkeys, so be prepared). There's toilet facilities and s few restaurants and cafes in the central area near the PUB Pump-house.

If you're a runner, then you'll love the place!"
,,good tracking site in singapore,5.0,,"it's good tracking site in Singapore, remember to check the open hour. sometimes you could see monkeys. There is tree-top walk within the track."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This place is a must to visit if you love nature and want to get away from the hectic lifestyle of singapore. There's a nice trail that is 11km long with a stretch of treetop walk. There's also a long stretch of boardwalk right beside the water, going on a weekday afternoon, it's so quiet, you can't hear any traffic or sound from the city, just birds chirpping and sound of water. Everything is so green, nice place to just go and relax, it is very underrated too when compared to botanic garden. I recommend coming here if you want to get away from the crowd."
,,Best place to spend time with family,4.0,,"Macritchie Reservoir is such a beautiful place to spend your day with the love ones. We can go for a walk and enjoy nature, lots of trees to protect you from the sun but beware of the monkeys as they can be aggressive!"
,,Nice walk away from the crowd,5.0,,"Singapore is a very busy place and its nice to get away and have some peace, calm and quiet. The MacRitchie walk and res is a nice place to do that. Plenty of flowers, tress and wildlife."
,,The best for nature in SG,5.0,,"The botanic garden is nice but for a slice of almost the real jungle deal head here. Miles of walking paths, pretty boardwalk along the lake, lots of monkeys, birds, lizards and turtles. Even our 4 year old wanted to walk for about 5km here before he got tired. Take a bus to get there. So worth it."
,,Urban Calm,4.0,,"Singapore as you know is hustle and bustle. This park is good walks, runs or just letting loose. Enjoy nature, sound of birds, insects and monkeys!"
,,Good morning walk,5.0,,First time at macritchie and had a good walk. One leisure round back to meeting point is about 1hr There is many things to see and do come in good footwear!
,,Forest in the City,5.0,,"I cannot believe that in such a city like Singapore has such a nurtual area that you can have a deep breath and fresh. Good place to get a way from city and rush area to be calm and relax. Good place for hiking, runing and cycling and else.!!!! you should have go!"
,,What a change from Midwestern USA!!,5.0,,"We had a wonderful 3 hour walk/hike to the Treetop Walk and MacRitchie Reservoir. The trails are good and well marked. Treetop Walk is a definite return visit and the reservoir is beautiful.

Do be aware of monkeys. We watched two groups being raided of their snacks and drinks which they were carrying in the open. Carry water and be prepared for the heat and humidity. Shorts and trainers are definitely the norm. I was probably older at near 60 than most hikers who seemed to be young twenties or high school age. Some young families. I am quite athletic and fit, this isn't the climate for a long hike, even with good trails as at MacRitchie, for those who are not used to 30 plus degrees and high humidity.

We had no trouble with a taxi taking us to Venus Drive to start our walk and hailing a taxi from Upper Thomson Road when finished. We went on a Saturday as I wanted to be sure there were people on the trail if we encountered difficulties. Precaution was unnecessary as the trail was so good. It was quite busy on Saturday AM, but this didn't take away from the experience. I will definitely repeat this visit on my next Singapore trip."
,,For energetic tourists,5.0,,"Start at the Mushroom Cafe and walk the 10.5km walk around MacRitchie to see rainforest, wildlife and beautiful equatorial plants. When you finish have a curry puff and a freah young coconut back at the cafe. One of our Singapore favourite places!"
,,Great place for a walk,4.0,,This is a great place to take a nice walk in the jungle. You will be able to get close into the different plants and trees. There is a free observation tower.
,,Great for hiking,4.0,,This is a very popular destination on weekends for locals to go running or hiking. Fairly easily accessible by public transport also. Need to watch out for the monkeys but otherwise this is a great place to visit.
,,Lots of great walking trails and nature,4.0,,"Great way to spend a few hours or even a whole day trekking through the reserve. If you are lucky you may also spot some wildlife, mostly monkeys, but make sure not to feed them like some of the dumb locals do."
,,Great trails in the forest,5.0,,"Less than 30min away from the city center you can dive into the ""jungle"". Most of the trails are in the shadow. You are in the middle of the nature so take enough water and food with you. The treetop walk is one of the highlights of the reservoir."
,,Had a Walk at the Cross-Country path,4.0,,"Had a slow walk on the Cross-Country path... took about 45 minutes to finish the 3.2 km route. The path among the undergrowth natural reserve is rather humid but there is no direct sunlight. The path is uneven and could be slippery.

Once you reached the path parallel to the road, it is just like any paths in Singapore. It can be rather dusty and noisy."
,,NIce place for Nature lover,4.0,,"It a nice place for nature lover, nice walking trail and can see lots of animal when you having a trail walk.Nice to visit early morning to enjoy the fresh air."
,,Experience the nature in the middle of Singapore,5.0,,"Nice place to explore the nature of Singapore. Love the whole environment. Monkey and forest, green and water. Love it a lot"
,,Great Walk,4.0,,Enjoyed the walk around the park on a nice sunny day. Long trail and good jogging path. Do wear sneakers when here as you will get tired from walking in flip flops as there are lots of rocks. Nice scenery of the reservoir. We didn't see much monkeys around. If you are lucky you will see them. The Mushroom Cafe by Old Chang Kee is pretty tasty as well so stop by if you are hungry!
,,Trail to TreeWalk,4.0,,"Nice walk. After roughly 2 hours inside the forest you will reach the ""TreeWalk"" which is a bridge suspended over trees in the canopy of the forest. You might enjoy a nice view without being extraordinary.
Dont forget to bring your water bottles. There are water fountain provided halfway of the walk, 5km after start.
Appart from that, you can rent some canoë (solo or multi) to enjoy the lake from another side."
,,Only decent trail in Singapore,5.0,,11km loop or you can do the treetops walk. Nice trail but gets very crowded and busy over weekends. Beware of very aggressive monkeys
,,good for tranquility,4.0,,"great place for a quiet stroll - short or long your choice. pleasant in the late afternoon or mid morning, weekends can get a little busy. watch out for the wild monkeys they will steal and attack for food. keep in in a bag"
,,Lovely area,4.0,,"MacRitchie is a lovely and large space to walk around, cycle, have a picnic and just relax. Its a nice area to go and get away from the busy city that is Singapore. In the mornings and later on in the afternoon, you will come across all sorts of animals from monkeys in the trees, exotic birds, turlas in the water."
,,An awesome Sunday,5.0,,"If you want to push yourself on a good 12 km walk, come here on a Sunday morning. There is a cafe that does a great curry puff and and walk is lovely, especially the walk across the top of the trees. Don't forget Sunscreen"
,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,"The macritchie reservoir and nature reserve is an absolute favourite within Singapore! Situated relatively close to the botanical gardens, it has unparalleled vistas of the sky walk, nature and biology! Excellent"
,,MACRITCHIE RESERVOIR,5.0,,Often referred to as nature’s playground for those who love the great outdoors. I love walking or jogging at this place during weekends to take a break from busy hectic worklife.. You feel you are much closer to the mother nature with plentiful trees and water around and chirping birds and animals.
,,Beautifull walk with magnificent views.,5.0,,My family and I did the walk on a Sunday morning and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The timber pathways are great!
,,Go early,5.0,,We started hiking to the tree top walk about 8:30 on Saturday morning. There were many people on the trail and it was congested with walkers and runners going in both directions. There is a ranger station along the way with bathrooms and water.
,,Nature,5.0,,"A really good place to relax or take a walk, the place is nicely done all natural and accessible, just stay quiet and allow nature to sing. Go in the morning, i guess it is cooler inside the jungle... just be careful of those monkies, do not let them see you eating, they will invite themselves to your feast!"
,,Great place for walking,5.0,,This is a fun place to get away from the city life. It is fun to walk through but it can get very warm of course. Bring enough water to drink.
,,trail walk,5.0,,"I went for a walk in the trail forest. It took about an hour stroll before I emerged from it and ended at the road side of Adam Road. Alternatively, there is a boardwalk by the water side, which is slightly longer, but just as relaxing."
,,A piece of the Great Outdoors in SG,5.0,,"A great place to go for a walk or run, to get away from the bustle and buildings, and feel like you are actually in the countryside and nature again! Paths are well maintained and lots of different route options for different fitness levels. Will try to make this a regular morning walk going forwards :)"
,,Best place to spend time with love ones,5.0,,Spend many hours at the reservoir and never get tired of it. We just love nature and water. It's so peaceful and very tranquillity.
,,A piece of real nature in the heart of Singapore,5.0,,"OK, maybe it's not completely wild, and there are still rules to obey, and it's quite busy on the weekends, but there are moments when you're alone on the way, surrounded by the trees and nothing else. And just for this the reservoir is worth visiting, there are some stunning views on the way. When you visit make sure to go to Tree Top Walk which is the most interesting part."
,,Great Singapore trail run,5.0,,"For foreigners, you should know that showers and lockers are near the Mushroom Cafe which is at the Lornie Road, Thomson Road cross road. Lockers are $1.00. Don't expect the Mushroom Cafe to make change.
It is a medium difficulty trail with good grounding, lots of room and no bicycles. There is a toilet, water stop about 4 k in if you go counter-clockwise. I suggest you run the resevoir counter-clockwise and enjoy the terrain and sights early on. It flattens out in the last 3 or 4 k.
Mushroom Cafe has mediocre coffee, OK food and rather grim service.
You should do the Tree-top Walk, even if you can't run it (don't try). The monkeys are worth seeing if nothing else!
Full showers are permitted and water is plentiful. A sweaty Singapore run followed by a cold shower is a great way to start the day!
For runners, MacRitchie Park circuit is a must do."
,,"Nice view, good trail.",5.0,,"It has lot's of trail there, good to spend the time. Not too easy to come, need to take MRT and then take the bus here. You can walk along with all the monkeys."
,,Just to it,5.0,,"Absolutely amazing walk. No need to say anymore, just go and see. Few words of advice: when you leave at the end you will experience that it might be difficult to get a cab. Walk to the shopping center nearby, there is a taxi stand. Wear dry-fit clothing as I can promise you that you will perspire. Bring plenty of water and some small nibbles as there is no cafe in the forest. Consider sunscreen and mosquito repellant. We haven't experienced any mosquitoes but the youngest one got surprisingly sunburned. Finally, follow the instructions on the road or you will find yourself wandering like us for 14 km in 30 degrees, super humid, hungry and thirsty. Anyway, it was well wort it, and I will be back here anytime ;)"
,,Visited here when checking out the nature trail,5.0,,Lovely relaxing spot to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life. Beautiful and serene.highly recommended
,,Tranquility in a noisy city,5.0,,The reservoir is one of the best places in Singapore for a retreat away from the noise of the city. It has lovely trails that take you into one of the few forested areas in Singapore.
,,Beware of monkeys,4.0,,"This place is great for hiking, jogging or running but beware of the monkeys who can easily grab anything from you so if your visiting this place make sure not to bring your valuables."
,,28 kms of Forest Reserve around a Reservoir in Central Singapore,5.0,,"MacRitchie is the head-to place for all types of activities including just a leisure romantic walk or wedding photo-shoot or extreme jogging and cycling in the forest reserve that is about 14 kilometers on 2 stretches - one heading towards Bukit Timah and the other towards Thomson area.

MacRitchie has a pretty reservoir and a board walking path around for family walks to explore the forest and marine life.

A tree top walk at the end of MacRitchie is a favourite to locals as it makes for compulsory walk of about 6 - 8 kms through scenic beauty.

Highly recommended for all."
,,Too many monkeys,3.0,,"Macritchie Park by itself is quite nice and has a few good walking trails. My problem with this park is the monkeys. A friend of mine got attacked by a monkey because she was holding a banana. When we were trying to do a famous ""tree top"" walk, there were so many monkeys and some also tried to attack us. If you go there, make sure you don't bring any bag with you as they go after bags and try to grab them."
,,Great Nature Retreat In Heart Urban City,5.0,,"Go here couple times a week to jog, there are many trails and boardwalks to mix it up to keep variety while jogging or hiking.

For newbies I suggest you start at mushroom cafe, check out map so you have idea what you want to do. I prefer you with east side of reservoir as it's more jungle coverage and often monkies hang out here as well

Make sure you have good supply of water, roughly halfway is station near tree top walk that has water and restrooms

You might also want rain Pancho or umbrella as rains can move in/out quick, else go with out like I do and use rain as chance to cool down"
,,Great for jogging,5.0,,Awesome place for walking and running. You should start early in morning because full track is about 11km and it gets mighty humid.
,,City getaway,5.0,,"Just to get out of the hustle of the city, enjoy the nature at MacRitchie. It has some hiking trails which are great for running if you get bored with running circles at MBS"
,,Weekly Rainforest Run,5.0,,"The run of approximately 14k takes place through the rainforest surrounding the MacRitchie reservoir. Part rough trail, part smooth trail and part board walk. If you enjoy running this is a challenge you'll not want to miss. Start by 8.00 and drink plenty of water, it's hotter and harder than you imagine!
On the run I saw a snake, cloud lizards, water monitors, horn bills, long tailed drongos and troops of monkeys!
So take your trainers and give it a go!!"
,,A dream place for nature lovers,5.0,,"Every time we travel to Singapore we make it a must go and run the round of 12km around the Reservoir. What a fantastic place, there are no pets, bicycles allowed. You have a peaceful time walking or running and there are shorter trails available."
,,Loved this...,5.0,,If you have time this is well with a trip out to see. Great wildlife and plenty of people out for a run.
,,A reason to run,5.0,,Singapore is busy/bustling city with world's highest population density with this this little surprise at its heart for its nature lovers. This park gives you reason/motivation to run. You need to start very early to reach top bridge before its too hot. Smallest trail will take atleast 2-3 hrs depending on you speed. Keep some water with you.
,,Childhood memories,3.0,,"A great place to visit for walks and strolls, some rough terrain but nothing too difficult to manage. A good pair of comfortable shoes is a must. Nice place to immerse yourself in nature."
,,best place for nature lovers,5.0,,"we ended up finishing 15km walk, really enjoyed it... It has several trails which has different distances, good place to escape from the bustling of the city. The lake is huge, you can even do the canoing there, but we were exhausted after the walk..."
,,Run/Trek,5.0,,"If you need fresh air in Singapore, visit one of the few that offers it. Do bring lots of water for the trip and be careful of the monkeys!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Lovely scenery, have gone through a few times because there are good nature walks through the forest and the TreeTop walk is really good, nice scenery but I must admit, the Indonesian smog was in the way last time I was there. Play sun smart and take enough water but there is a ranger station to fill up your water bottles, you don't really get a good sense of just how far you are walking. Monkeys can be cheeky but I've not experienced them grabbing any of my gear, more me being nervous, I think."
,,Pocket of nature in the bustling city.,5.0,,"- The oldest reservoir in Singapore, built in the colonial period.
- A welcome sight for joggers and walkers in the early morning.
- Shower, toilet, and locker facilities available.
- Few parking spaces on weekends, best to get there by bus.
- A nature trail (forest + boardwalk) skirts the water's edge, a total walkable distance of approx. 11km (3-4 hours).
- The Tree-Top Walk (one-way) is a popular attraction, follow the signs.
- Kayak rentals, cheap food options available. Maybe a bar too, I think.
- Photogenic spots: ""the zigzag bridge"" and a fountain nearby

Some precautions:

- Observe basic etiquette: don't litter, and don't pollute the air with noise and/or smoke.
- Safety: always stay on the marked trails.
- Never feed the macaques. This is serious: you could incur a S$500 fine. If you feel uneasy among them, either back off or walk past them, gently and quietly.

Guided tours are sometimes hosted by volunteer groups. Google for details.

These will ensure you have an enjoyable experience here. Have a great journey."
,,Beautiful walk on Sunday,5.0,,"We went to this place yesterday and walked for 7.8 kilometers (above 10,000 steps).

It's easy to get in and out of here by Bus. I clicked on map in TA page which will direct me to Google map that suggests a few bus numbers that could bring me here.

The one I use was no. 980 which drop me right in front which very close to car parking area on Lornie Road. On you right hand there's restroom, Cafe and Drinks Kios. In case you forget to bring water. You just stop here first to buy drink. It won't be other Kios along the way.

Both me and my hubby, we just did boardwalk along the water. I was very nice and peaceful. This place wasn't busy even on Sunday afternoon.

We only saw a few butterflies and a dozen of monkeys yesterday. Monkey weren't friendly here. You can't get to close. Do not carry plastic bag with you. If they see plastic bag they will come right to you and try to take it away. Put everything in your bagpack is best. Looking at them from distance and use zoom in camera was enjoyable enough.

Personally, I preferred walking around here than botanical garden. Definitely we will be back again soon."
,,Nature on your,5.0,,Doorstep. It's worthwhile making the effort to get hwre to get out of the heat and bustle of the city. Many sheltered trails for walking and running. It's 10k around the lake. Food and drink and lockers at the mushroom cafe
,,Nice walk,5.0,,"If you have some spare time, I would definitely recommend taking the time to come here. It's so nice to escape the busy and crowded city and go for a walk around the reservoir or one of the paths. We did not plan on doing any walking and I was in sandals, yet we ended up walking almost 15km. It's so peaceful in that area. A lot of locals go here for jogging and walking. You can also see monkey along the way, which for some people may be a plus. I would definitely come back here for a relaxing afternoon."
,,Nature Lovers getaway in the Bustling City,4.0,,"Had a ball walking around the reservoir checking out some amazing forest as well as some of the wildlife including monkeys, squirrels and bird life. Great spot for a stroll, bike or a picnic. Also got to try the tree top walkway. Really enjoyed our day here."
,,Lots of walking and wildlife,5.0,,"If you're looking to hike around a reservoir for 10km or more this is the place for you. The flora and fauna are amazing. The terrain can be muddy and a bit unstable so wear hiking shoes or tennis shoes (I don't know how the sandal or flip flop wearers did it). You will see monkeys if you pay attention (or they may come down to your level anyway). Signs caution to beware of snakes though we saw none despite being on the lookout (that paradise gliding snake looks very cool in the photos). We got to see one skink and a number of millipedes and other creatures, some of which we don't know the names of, and being outdoors tromping around for 4 hours are so much fun. This place is free of charge and well worth it if you like nature. It's closed on Mondays but open the other 6 days a week."
,,Nature Kisses,5.0,,"Best place for a forest shower ! Great place to walk around with the sun, trees, plants, water around ! A must go in Singapore"
,,Weekend Exercise Place,4.0,,My sunday walk place. This is a good place for those who love the natural walk. 3 hours inside the natural surrounding with flora and fauna. There is one treetop walk too.
,,Best place for nature trails in SG,4.0,,"No more boring city views and feels so much relaxed. Good place to sit and talk with your friends or partner, But weekends seems bit crowded."
,,Can't believe there is such a place in SG,4.0,,It's a good place for jogging or trekking. Very good atmosphere. But beware monkeys. They tried to attacked me T_T
,,Get away from it all,4.0,,"I come here jogging frequently. There's a tree top walk you can check out. Beware of monkeys - avoid carrying plastic bags as they will go for those, otherwise pretty safe to walk past them. There's a toilet / drinking water somewhere in the middle of the park, and a cafe near the carpark. Shower facilities available. Accessible by bus (plenty of those, use google maps).

Avoid end year as its monsoon season and the paths can get muddy."
,,The natural beauty of MacRitchie Reservoir,5.0,,"You can take bus service number 157 or 852 and alight near the main entrance of the Reservoir which is at the junction of Lornie Road and Thomson Road.
This old reservoir stores water for residents in Thomson Road and also other residents. Near the edge of the water you will find pitcher plants (Nepenthes gracilis) growing in abundance. There are lots of bougainvillea near the water edge. The jungle tracks are used by students for their annual cross country run and competition.
It is very pleasant to walk in the park either in the early morning or in the evening. Secondary school students usually come here to canoe in the afternoons after their school hours.
Occasionally you will encounter a squirrel, a monitor lizard, kingfishers and monkeys. There are some cafes and toilets and also a bandstand where bands give a public performance on Sundays and public holidays.
On the nearby hill there is the tomb of Lim Bo Seng the war hero of Singapore. An old boy of Raffles Institution, Lim was killed by the Japanese. But Lim will always be revered by all Singaporeans as a great hero.
On rainy days where there is a thunderstorm it is best to avoid this place."
,,"Great ""off the beaten track"" track",5.0,,"Take a cab here for a nice walk around the lake, and if you're lucky bump into the monkeys, monitor lizards, and squirrels as you do the walking trail!"
,,Peaceful Moments,4.0,,"If you want a break from your hectic touring of the Republic, then a nice, usually cool, place to visit, is MacRitchie Reservoir. Usually deserted in working hours, and only the odd angler trying his luck from the purpose built fishing points. you can sit in the shade and soak in the beauty of the trees and fauna, and the bird life, so do take your camera, and a bottle of water to be stave off thirst. Accessible by public transport."
,,A natural beauty spot for all to enjoy,5.0,,"Walked around the reservoir (12km?) in the morning. Good workout and beautiful views across the reservoir and tree tops.

Saw several others taking some form of exercise but never felt crowded.

Remarkably large area of relative wilderness. Saw plenty of monkeys and I'm told there are monitor lizards and snakes too!

Free access so no reason not to visit to enjoy one of Singapore's natural beauty spots."
,,Great walk and stunning views from the tree tops,5.0,,"Wife, son and I go out walks around the reservoir which we really enjoy. Even on a hot day under the canopy of the trees, it's not so hot. Further on the walk you come to a bridge overlooking the tree tops. Lovely views here. Continuing across the bride you then enter wooden stairs which takes you further along the walk. Really nice. All in all, very enjoyable."
,,lovely place for a stroll or a run,3.0,,Excellent place for a leisure walk or jogging.Several places to sit and enjoy nature.Incredible wildlife.This place is full of mosquitoes during late evening beware of that.there is bus transport to nearest MRT Bishan.
,,Great place for a walk or long run.,5.0,,"I run here sometimes when not to hot. You can easily do an enjoyable 20km before you have to tread over the same ground again. Varying land features, hills and paved and unpaved paths."
,,Beautiful oasis!,5.0,,"My husband and I had a lovely morning exploring some of McRitchie Park. It was nice to get into a non-crowded space and just stroll through the rainforest looking for monkeys (we saw one just when we'd almost given up hope!). It's a very beautiful, peaceful place and I recommend it as an antidote to the usual hustle and bustle of Singapore. It's also a great place to run if you can cope with the humidity."
,,Peace and Quiet away from the city. The place to see wild monkeys!,5.0,,"MacRitchie reservoir is fantastic and one of our favourite places in Singapore. Singapore is basically one big city, and there isn't much in the way of open spaces, or wildlife. However get on the bus and travel out to MacRitchie and you can enjoy fantastic walks, wonderful plants, and fantastic wildlife. We went primarily to see the monkeys, and we weren't disappointed - there a many. As long as you stick to the guidelines and don't try to touch them, or make eye contact then they leave you alone and go about their business (its amazing how many people try to get too close and get annoyed when they react!). Also be wary of carrying food. We had a lovely long walk and saw so many animals - it was lovely. Get out of the city and relax!"
,,Amazing place for a walk or a run,5.0,,"One of the best parks in Singapore to walk or run and also great for some great photos. The tree top walk is a must. The biodiversity if huge and it really takes you to outside of the confusion of the city. If you're keen on being close to monkeys, this is a nice place."
,,Crown Jewel of all reservoirs in Singapore,5.0,,"A must-explore for especially the ecological visitors to our beautiful City State as among the best natural heritage of our most treasured water resources!
Tropical wild lives like wild boars, pythons and monkeys have been thriving in the well-preserved natural jungles along with local and migrant birds.
The Nation's best Island Country Golf Club is there in the backdrop to enhance the luxurious greenery of the Reservior, and for the historians, one could still find national monuments of our WWII heros and the remains of the shrines of our savage invaders who once ruled Singapore for 3 years and 8 months till 1945 !"
,,Loverly Park,4.0,,"Lovely large park. Paths through the rainforest provide a nice shade. We only saw a small part of it, but there are several trails to choose from (in various distances)."
,,"Beautiful, peaceful, and scenic. Worth the long bus ride from town!",4.0,,"If you're looking for some peace and quiet, or a scenic run while in Singapore, you'll do worse than head over to the spacious and well-kept MacRitchie Reservoir.

The paths are wide and impeccably clean, and everywhere you look is a photo-opportunity. First timers might have a hard time navigating the large park, so grab a map at the entrance (the cafeteria employees aren't helpful at all, so don't bother asking).

Do NOT forget to bring an umbrella or a raincoat. We didn't get to walk around as much as we were caught by pouring rain."
,,Great Hike and Getaway,5.0,,Excellent hike with great chance to see monitor lizards and monkeys! There is a treetop bridge which is wonderful. Make sure to bring water as this hike is a real one.
,,Nice addition to your list of 'the great outdoors' for weekend activity.,4.0,,"Easily accessible, well kept and maintained grounds. Lots of interesting and exciting nature wildlife to discover while taking a nice walk by the water. Excellent for children and for those who enjoy going for jogs, runs or powerwalking."
,,A must-do activity,5.0,,"One of my favourite places to go. Great to get away from traffic & hustle of city life. Can be very quiet early in the mornings, great for a run or a relaxing stroll."
,,GO for fitness!,5.0,,We enjoyed the eco-tourism of this place. We run the 11km for 1.5 hours. Its a sweaty day! tired but fulfilled!
,,Hangover cure run around this beauty,5.0,,"Got talked into doing this when I was slightly worse for wear - but completed and felt better for it! Going up the tower half way around is a killer, but glorious scenery all around"
,,Jungle hike. Not for the faint-hearted,4.0,,"If you want a bit of the country, right in the city. MacRitchie is the place to be!

We were drawn by the idea of the jungle canopy walk, which was amazing. However, bear in mind that unless you plan your route carefully there is a LONG walk to get to it, as well as to get back to base.

The walk itself is through some rough terrain, lots of uphills and bumps (we saw some brave husbands determinedly pushing prams - unless you are really fit I would not recommend this).

Lots of wildlife on the walk. Loads of monkeys to watch playing, lizards and goannas can all be spotted from the raised walkway through the marshes at the end (great design by sg government to make sure human visitors don't trample or stray off into animal habitats)

Take water, insect repellent and go on a cool day. We went on a hot day thinking the forest would be cool, but it was pretty hot still because all those trees meant no air flow.

Tiring, but very worthwhile and great if you love nature."
,,should try when you go to Singapore,5.0,,"We had a half of day walking to the natural park. You can see many kind of trees and animals ( monkey, snails, birds, butterflies, turtle, ..). ""Tree top walk"" is nice bridge that you can see the park at the top tree view. We went in a grey day with palm polluted dust from Indonesia but I never feel it when you go inside the park. Be careful with the monkeys, they had bad behavior when looking for foods from guess."
,,MacRitchie,4.0,,"Beautiful scenery, away from the concrete of Singapore. Very relaxing sounds and if keeping at a constant pace you see very few people.
Lots of insects, we saw a small snake and plenty of monkeys awaiting tourists to try to get food.
Take plenty of water with you and wear gym type clothes to keep you a bit fresher!"
,,Excellent place for a walk,5.0,,"Great place to go for a few hours. Lots of wildlife around. Make sure you bring extra water as when you are on the trails there isn't any to buy. You will see giant lizards, monkeys, turtles and slim possibility of snakes (if you are very, very lucky). Venus loop if a great place to see monkeys."
,,Nice surprise in a city of concrete,5.0,,"Singapore is a great place.......if you like shopping, cars and concrete. Being here for work is nice but on your own can be quite boring (I know that is a strange thing to say). However having a good look around can you find gems like this. A great walk with plenty see, monkeys, monitors and butterflies. Water looks great and the tree tops was worth the sweat."
,,A Piece of Jungle in the Center of Singapore Island,5.0,,"If you like a hike, the combination of Treetop walk, Mac Ritchie Nature Trail and the path along Mac Ritchie Reservoir creates a nice 10km nature walk in the jungle center of Singapore Island. We started at the Venus Drive entrance, walked to the Treetop walk first and then along the Nature trail to the lake and along the lakeshore to the Marymont MRT. You will find a bird watchtower and lots of more or less undisturbed nature. All trails are well signed, you won't get lost."
,,Tropical jungle oasis in the middle of the city,5.0,,We caught the MRT its an easy 700 metre walk from Caldecott station on the circle line. Once on the nature trail you rapidly forget you are in a city of 5 million and become immersed in a world of lush tropical forest with abundant wildlife. The monkeys were the highlight of our visit carrying on grooming in happy family groups ignoring our interruption of their idyllic life. The combination of rolling hills and tropical heat and humidity makes it an energetic walk but well worth while. It was the highlight of my trip and I will definitely come back when next in Singapore to further explore the extensive trail network
,,Walk,5.0,,Best place for walkers.Quiet and calm. Well maintained and clean. Tree top walk is some thing will makes you come again and again :-)
,,"Very pretty, be prepared!",4.0,,"A very pretty park with good walks and wildlife, we saw two monitor lizards and lots of monkeys! Just remember not to have any food in your bag as we saw a monkey attack someone's bag trying to get the food inside!

We went on the treetop trail which offered some brilliant views across the canopy. However, we were not prepared for the walk that we went on, coupled with the heat, it was a difficult trek at times. Just remember cool clothes and water! Would recommend."
,,Picnic at Macritchie,4.0,,There are a few spots where one can do a picnic at Macritchie Reservoir. We ate on a podium type platform near the restaurant. Beware of the monkeys. Did the very nice walking trail on the boardwalk as well
,,Peaceful place for the weekend,4.0,,"A serene place for a picnic or fishing. Hardly any covered areas so make sure to bring a hat or to wear sunscreen. There is a place to eat near buy called the Mushroom cafe but most people bring their own lunch or try their luck fishing.

Canoeing also available on certain schedules"
,,MacRitchie Reservoir,4.0,,This is a beautiful garden near a reservoir . There is a zig zag bridge path in the middle of the reservoir which looks great and is fun walking on it . The landscape is beautiful and away from the city . Nice place to relax and have picnic .
,,MacRitchie Reservoir,5.0,,Beautiful just after sunrise. The forest walk oversees the huge lake. The are abundant wildlife every where waiting to be discovered.
,,My Favorite Natural Hiking Place in Singapore,5.0,,"I really like this place for hiking for the following reasons:
* It's naturally reserved, so you get a feeling of walking in the forest.
* It is away from the city hustle. The vastness of the place also means it gets much less crowded - even on the weekends - than many other Singapore attractions.
* It is relatively underdeveloped - compared to other tourist-oriented places in SG, which I like because it looks more natural.
* There are several different hiking tracks with varying lengths you can take based on your time and energy.
* You may get to see monkeys!
* It's free!
I have been there in both sunny and rainy days, and I equally enjoyed them all. Here are a few tips:
* Check the weather forecast for the region. Bring along suitable equipment for both sunny and rainy weather (e.g. umbrella and raincoat). There are few shelters around, and you'd be soaking wet if you're in the middle of a track and get caught in the rain.
* It's easier to check the nearest public transport stops and the route to get there and back before you leave home than later.
* Look up the different trails and their entrances (and the way to get to that entrance - previous tip) on the website, especially if you want to also check the tree-tops bridge (I hope I wrote the name correctly :p). It's also a good idea to bring a copy of the map (physical or digital) along if you don't have GPS or don't want to drain your phone's battery in the long hike.
* The tree-top bridge closes down early evening (~4-5pm) so get to the Reservoir earlier in the day if you want to visit it.
* Mosquito repellents are also recommended if you happen to be there around sunset or evening.
* Bring drinking water. There might be a few drinking water fountains around (I only know of one), but you wouldn't know in advance when you get to one. Humid weather + long hike => dehydration.
* Enjoy the natural hike! :)"
,,Weekends,5.0,,grab a bottle of water and hike through the lush foliage from MacRitchie to Bukit Timah...a nice 14km hike and forget the concrete jungle
,,Feel like running in a forest,5.0,,"I've been to this park twice, both for morning run. I really like this place except for the distance that I have to go through. If you want to feel like running in a forest, feel the fresh air, hear the bird chirping, I think this is the only place to go in Singapore. There's a shower facility so you can carry on with life after running."
,,Good place for walking & hiking,4.0,,"If you like long distance walk, suggest to visit McRitchie park. Will give you a flavour of hiking as well while going to HSBC peak."
,,A Must Do.,5.0,,"A lovely place to walk. We saw turtles, monkeys, a humming bird and lizards. It's an amazing contrast to Singapore City."
,,Right place to get disconnected from Busy life,5.0,,"If you can walk long distances and enjoy the nature, this is the place for you. Just carry some water in a bottle that you can refill at refreshment points along the walking trails. The HSBC Tree top walk is worth visiting in this Jungle. If you love photography, Get ready to capture till the battery drains."
,,bit hard to find but worth it,4.0,,"Wow! We lived in Singapore for 9 months before we found this place. What a beautiful place to go for a walk/run. Massive park, so many monkeys etc. Take a water bottle."
,,Good hiking adventure,4.0,,"If you're into hiking the woods, then this place is for you. It's a relatively easy trail so no need to be frightened. And the Tree top walk at the end of it makes it worth it."
,,"Nature lovers, you will like it",4.0,,"I would say this one of my favourite places in SG. Great spot for jogging and hiking! It's quite far from other popular places, so i guess the best way to get there is by taxi. Leaving the place is easier if you catch a bus and get to the nearest station. Don't remember seeing anyone hailing a taxi there.

If you just want to enjoy the nature without making yourself too tired,you can always go the restaurant on top of the hill. I tried the food, very nice with large portion too! Price, average.

Apparently, the place is quite popular for kayaking too. Not too sure about the price and so on. You could check out some websites for it.

Oh, one thing. Please do not make any eye-contact with the monkeys (If you did, accidentally or not, just bravely shoo them away)! They will be all around the walk path, so just walk pass them normally. Do not, seriously, do not bring any food in plastics, they will definitely snatch them away from you. Saw that happen right in front of me."
,,Vast Nature Trail in the heart of the city!,4.0,,"Fantastic place replete with long trails (upto 10 kms), with a huge reservoir, park benches, nice eateries, and excellent views. An excellent place to relax 'far from the madding crowd'!"
,,Great for walking and jogging,4.0,,Bumpy trail around the reservoir but not very steep at all. A number of routes are available one which includes the bridge. Great for jogging and walking. Unfortunately no dogs allowed as a lot of monkeys around

,,Excellent,5.0,,"Ok, here's the deal, I love a good hike. And this is what you get a wonderful like through this park like preserve with some very interesting wildlife if your lucky enough to spot it. Don't look at the monkey in the eyes, it frightens them and they'll let you know by showing you their teeth (ask me how I know). On the trail that goes over the bridge i also saw a massive (you could ride this thing) monitor lizard. Stopped me in my tracks. Ok, maybe not ride it but i think i had to change my diaper, Either way, I love the hike excellent free thing to do in Singapore. Just bring plenty of water for the hike."
,,Great and close by,5.0,,"Wonderful escape from the cit, even on a hot day. Popular with runners because nice and shady. If only you could swim!"
,,Fantastic Nature Walk,5.0,,"There is over 10 km of walk around the reservoir and through the jungle. It took us a good afternoon to di the whole thing. There are places to sit in the shade or from the rain at a couple of points in the loop.
It is probably better to go when cloudy or nt at noon - but I went at 1pm and it was light rain which was still warm and refreshing - wear a cap!
the suspension bridge is fantastic, wish it was longer but no complaints. You can only go along it in one direction (presumably in case it is busy) And it gets locked at end of day and on Mondays. Half way across the bridge there is a door, after the door you get lots of monkeys, here they can jump form the bridge to trees, before the door they run away from you as the tree tops are too low to jump from the bridge, but past the door they will come close, apparently they scratch you if you have food,but with no food they were just friendly!
On the suspension bridge you can look 360 degrees and not see any buildings, it is all nature a truly fantastic view in Singapore. worth spending 4 hours walking around, more if you like some rest breaks!

There is a restaurant with toilets but obviously this doesn't take up most of the 10Km"
,,Perfect hike,5.0,,We did I the 12km trail passing through the bridge over the trees and the lake and we loved it! And the best of all was that it was free! You dknt have to pay anything to enter so what are you waiting for
,,Beautifully green but too crowded,4.0,,"MacRitchie and the connected forest trails are perhaps one of the most beautiful walks in Singapore. Do try to time your visit to the pre-dawn hours or mid-day to avoid the crowds.

Having to dodge corporate warrior speedwalkers and geriatric fixtures can take away from the joy of taking in the sights and sounds of the forest. Arriving before the dawn or just before dusk also allows one the opportunity of spotting animals."
,,great nature walk,5.0,,probably my favorite nature walk in Singapore. prepare yourself for ~10KM of decent walk with great views. remmemebr that the bridge is one way - you can't go back ...
,,"Nice place, calm in the city",5.0,,"This is a huge reservoir with great natural areas that you can walk around. A lot of wildlife, from small mammals (squirrels in the trees) and many species of butterflies and dragonflies, as well as monitor lizards and huge numbers of birds. Lots of different trees some flowering. Singapore has some nice natural spots considering it is a huge city on a tiny island. Singapore takes conservation and preventing global warming seriously. From maintaining the reservoirs to educating the public about global warming (at Gardens by the Bay) and ensuring people understand the link between nature and humanity Singapore appears to take sustainability very seriously. They keep protecting areas like the reservoir as they understand they not only moderate the rainfall, supply water for human use and help people stay linked with nature but they also generate tourism."
,,Beautiful park with running trails,5.0,,Great place to run for trail running enthusiasts - I highly recommend the HSBS Tree Tops walk which is along a trail in MacRitchie.
,,A must visit if you have a few spare hours to unwind.,5.0,,"The peace and serenity has to be experienced to be believed. Calm, beautiful, relaxing. Well set out."
,,Nice relaxing walk,5.0,,"We go walking through here regularly. Really nice walk, not very demanding but very peaceful. Don't feed the monkeys"
,,A great walk in the countryside... in Singapore!,5.0,,"The sizeable MacRItchie Reservoir is Singapore's oldest reservoir and is now the location for a number of hiking and nature trails. It is easy to reach by bus and, once there, everything is neatly signposted.

I went with a friend on a Sunday afternoon and had a very pleasant walk beside the water and through the woodland away from the ""city"" that Singapore is usually so famous for. Along the way we even saw actual wildlife (monkeys and birds).

There are several trails to choose from, depending on the length of walk you wish to embark upon, however we took perhaps the longest and also ventured onto the stunning HSBC sponsored treetop walk. This is essentially a long suspended bridge at treetop height - make sure you enter this from the right direction though as you only walk one way.

,,A heaven for the serious Trekkers,5.0,,For the lovers of tracking it is a heaven . The feeling of being in the countryside as you enter here will you in awe . The sheer scale of the landscape is mind blowing . Not for a tourist in hurry . If you crave for a serious tracking this is an invitation . Good walking shoes .
,,Wedding on water,5.0,,"Wide open space with pavilions dotted all over the ground giving a bird eye view of reservoir from higher slopes. Plenty of jogging paths and lockers in the restrooms and refreshment kiosks. A nicely located restaurant can be reserved for small and intimate wedding for close friends, colleagues and families. Give good memories!"
,,Amazing Nature Trails,5.0,,"We loved this nature trail. Even though we took the shorter trail, it was raining around that time and the walk seems like a perfect jungle walk for us. We were also lucky to spot monkeys and monitor lizards. Would love to go again and again."
,,Definitely For Hiking And Nature Enthusiasts,4.0,,"If you are in Singapore and the weather is cool (probably towards the evening) - set aside 3 to 4 hours if you want to do the whole loop that is associated with this ambitious hike around MacRitchie Reservoir encompassing the Tree Top Walks. It is definitely a challenge especially if you have young kids and older people with you.

Go armed with Mosquito spray, suntan lotion, a hat, a towel as you will sweat lots, a walking stick and good walking shoes - preferably trainers and lots of water - also a sweet energy bar or something that keeps the energy going.

Be prepared to encounter birds, snakes, monkeys (sometimes quite aggressive) ants and insects and don't feed any of them or take out food especially in the presence of monkeys as they will grab and go. Also don't stroke and touch as whilst they look tame they are still wild.

The walk from the Venus Car Park drop off point (there is free parking) is a good 45 minutes of 2.8 km from the actual metal bridge which you see in pictures (called the Tree Top Walks). We went - 3 adults and 3 kids (all under 10 years) and whilst there were some complaints mainly because it was a hot day - the terrain was fairly flat and the paths were fairly easy walking (not many steps except at the bridge connector areas).

Walking there is a one way street so there is NO TURNING BACK. There is a number to call at one of the Ranger booths if you have headed out and it starts to rain but don't count on turning back as there is no shelter except for the small resting points along the way that you will have to make your way to. Hence don't set out if you think it will rain.

Having been to the Tree Top Walk in Perth, this one seems much shorter and less spectacular but it is worth the journey and given Singapore weather you would be grateful that its just the length that it is.

For a less ambitious route - do the walk to the Tree Top Bridge and circle around. The other options are to walk the reservoir round - definitely for a day when you feel extremely energised or the weather remains perfect. The park closes at 5pm so make sure you find your way out before that. Bring drinks as there are NO kiosks or tourist trappings of any sort along the way! There is also only ONE bathroom stop along the way so try to make sure you GO before you go. Enjoy!"
,,Beautiful Reservoir,4.0,,Beautiful Reservoir in the heart of the city. There is no entrance fees so just walk in for free. Come in the morning or late in the evening to avoid the sun.
,,Good workout for joggers and leisure exercises too,5.0,,Went with a group of friends for a casual walk. Chit chat and admired the tall trees which brought old memories while we were young. Used to come here for cross country run! Good old days though! Loved the tranquility
,,We saw Monkeys!,5.0,,"Monkeys are nice, but the MacRitchie trail is also one of the best trail systems I've ever seen. It's extremely clean and well kept. The trail signage is excellent. There is a lot to see here. We hiked over 10k. Bring lots of water, but note that a lot of the trail system is in the shade.

We took a Taxi there, which was fine, but note that it's a little harder to just catch a taxi back to the city. You may have to call for a cab or walk out to one of the more busy roads."
,,Always good fun with young children,4.0,,"In addition to the interesting walks through the jungle (which aren't so suitable for young children, unless you're willing to carry them) the walk near the reservoir on the established paths is worth a look. Easy enough to push a pram along, or for kids to ride scooters. Often there are monkeys to be seen, and the odd turtle or fish to see in the reservoir."
,,HSBC Tree Top Trail in Mac Ritche Reservoir,5.0,,HSBC Tree Top Trail is the best trail to do when going for first time. Do kayaking on the waters just before start of trail. It is very cheap and the kayak boats are really stable.
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Wow so much to see and do we did the tree top walk its was amazing 25metres up I the tree canopy what a fantastic view. The monkeys are so close almost sitting on your shoulders, just an amazing place."
,,Nice trails for hiking/running.,4.0,,It's as lovely a place for a family stroll as it is for a nice trail run. Shady and well-kept with enough visitors and hardly ever too crowded. If you're lucky you'll spot families of monkeys who live all over the reservoir. They're usually pretty harmless unless they notice you carrying food (or what appears to be food). When/if you spot them be sure not to feed them or be prepared to be harassed!
,,Who says there's no nature in Singapore?,5.0,,"This little nature reserve ain't that little at all with the vast bio-diversity. From monkeys that you may encounter playing about, to the reptilian sorts, or those in flight to those that swim. This nature reserve has them all. You won't feel like you are in the city. A nice respite of calm and tranquility just minutes away from the MRT station and the bustling heartlands nearby."
,,Lovely,5.0,,After we did the MacRitchie nature trail we stopped off and walked round parts of the Reservoir because 11km doing the trail wasn't enough ha! Really lovely.
,,nature walk,4.0,,"Pleasant and cool , outdoor walk or run is suitable for this reservoir. Relax and close to nature, it is a good start of the day with a walk round the trail. Can see monkeys sometimes swinging from tree to tree."
,,Morning Trekking,5.0,,"I always love going to Maritchie Reservoir for a good tree top walk calories sweat out!

However please avoid going on Mondays as the OCBC Suspension bridge will be closed.

Aside from that, try not to bring bags that can be seen through especially is you are bringing snacks in it. The monkeys around are very intelligent and have attempted to attack your bags with no hesitation. other than that, they are actually harmless even if you walk close to them.

Head to the toilet first before starting your journey & bring water. Some points of the treks might be muddy but however mostly cemented.

Well maintained natural environment and to go if you are looking into having the ""non-city"" feeling. This will definitely be one of the places you have to go to in order to get a breather from all the sky scrapers around!

Bring a camera if you are a scenic person!"
,,Excellent park,5.0,,A wonderful place for people who love nature and just wanting to be away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Go to the HSBC treetop walk for a bird's eye view of the nature reserve.
,,Nice Escape From The City,4.0,,"Urban parks are always such a nice break from the concrete jungles of big cities. MacRitchie Reservoir is a beautiful spot for a sunny afternoon, not far from downtown and easily accessed by short cab ride or transit hop.

The walkways are well-maintained, level and easy for most people. Be prepared for the monkeys though, if you're packing food they might try to steal snacks."
,,"Nice, cool nature walk.",3.0,,A very cool and refreshing place for a morning jog if you are staying in the Northern part of this island. The scenery and natural view around it is nice but do beware of the mosquitoes that might be anywhere. Do not feed the monkey as well.
,,A good exp for those who love walking around lake,4.0,,"Make sure you have good pair of shoes, definitely one need it if he or she has plans to cover 14km trail, there are other things to do as, go early in the morning for photography, beware of monkeys, they might grab food items if you are carrying it in open. If you are lucky then you might spot little green snakes too, good place for walkers, photographers, Can take full trail only if you are used to. Tea-Coffee-snacks option is available, This place is also reachable by SMRT, SBS buses. Two-three nearby bus stops are there."
,,A beautiful place to relax and enjoy nature,5.0,,"A beautiful place to relax and enjoy nature.

The nearest MTR station is the Toa Payoh station [North-South / Red line] from where you can board bus number 157 to get off on Lornie road. There is a visitors service center located adjacent to the bus stop, which has washrooms, showers, lockers and a restaurant, but no tourist information counter. Painted on a wall, within the service center, adjacent to the restaurant counter, is a large color map of the area. A short distance into the trail there is a detailed map of the area showing different trail routes, difficulty levels, landmarks and facilities en-route.

It is an easy trail, going by the side of a lake, with short slopes to climb, and then on to the tree top walk. You may come across monkeys and monitor lizards along the trail. The tree top walk is about 250 meters in length, and is a one way walk. There are beautiful views across tree tops and its really breathtaking, especially if you are a nature enthusiast. You can chose to return back to the same trail, or proceed ahead to complete the trail circuit [which I chose]. Some lengths of this route has wooden walkways. The total length of the trail is approximately 11 kilometers and the tree top walk is located midway along the route.

There are rest points throughout the trail, and there are plenty of sign boards with directions. I went on a week day, and there were hardly any crowds. I suggest light clothing, T-shirt and shorts would be ideal, with a good pair of walking/running shoes. Be ready to be bathed in sweat or in rains, whatever the weather gods may chose for your entertainment for the day. At an easy pace the trail should take about 4 hours to complete.

Do carry a change of clothes, light snacks and water. Once you get back to the visitors service center, you can shower and change, and also grab a bite at the restaurant, which has a decent range of food options.

Remember that the tree top walk is closed on Mondays, and is open from 09:00 AM to 05:00 PM on all other days,"
,,away from the hustle bustle of city life,4.0,,"I love it. I go there every Sunday for almost two years with my friends. It can get crowded but there's room for everyone. There are different tracks for different people. Lots to see. Lots to discover. It's a place for kids too. Turtles, monkeys, trees, water,"
,,relaxation & nature,5.0,,"our favorite place, we go there every weekend with the kids. One of the view pieces of real nature in SG"
,,Wonderful natural environment in Singapore,5.0,,"Loved, loved, loved this place. Spent many hours running around the reservoir, hiding from monitor lizards, snakes and monkeys!! Easy trail to run on, Even if you are a beginner and out door exercise equipment to use if you want more of a workout. Probably the only place in Singapore that doesn't feel man made. Hook up with the MacRitchie runners who do 5k, up to ultras races. There is an excellent cafe to get a meal and a shower. Really good food. I wish I could have taken the whole place home with me."
,,A Great nature trails,4.0,,"you can go to the famous tree top walk, seightseeing of nature trairs, bird eyes catching, and flora and fauna exploration."
,,Top 10 Parks to Unwind in Singapore,5.0,,It caters for all ages. My children love to play kites there. They love observing turtles and watching birds there. The monkeys can be nuisance though.
,,Relaxing place,5.0,,"My favourite relax walk. If you want to go away and be by yourself ... this is the place. Take a slow walk (you will come across those runners) and enjoy the natural jungle. Nearest mrt station is Marymount Mrt on Circle line. Some tips in the resevoiur:-
1. Do finish your walk by maximum 1830 as it can get dark inside, no lamps and the trees are tall.
2. Watch out for the monkeys if you are eating and walking/strolling especially around 1600 to 1730. They come out to look for food and move around a bit.
3. Bring a raincoat cos if there is a sudden downpour, umbrellas arent useful.
4. There is a cafe selling finger food and snacks at the start point.
5. Please stay away from the SICC driving range. Though some parts are not fenced, it is private property and golf balls ""fly"" all over, you know. I have seen some tourists (i guessed from their dressings) resting and taking photos on the range!"
,,Jungle in the city,4.0,,"I spend almost 3 hours in this area and saw crocodiles, monkeys, exotic trees and jungle feeling. I know only one location at the start where you can buy some refreshments. Take the water with you. You will surround a little lake but there is an opportunity to walk on top of the tree."
,,Beautiful palce and good work out,5.0,,Geat place for nature lovers.. peaceful and plesant.. we took 11km trail.. in heat .... but enjoyed a lot.. must go atleast a month ... dont forget to bring lot of water.energy bars..:)
,,Great,4.0,,"Really amazing place to be when the sun is out. Just to chill. Place links to the trail that leads to treetop walk. Nearest MRT Station is Caldecott Mrt station, it is a 15 minute walk away."
,,fantastic walk,5.0,,"11km is a long walk in the heat, but there are so many habitats and different animals. Monkeys, lizards terrapins, many varieties of butterfly.dont miss treetop walk-suspension bridge in the rainforest canopy. All for free. Good cafe at the end."
,,In love❤️,5.0,,One of my favorite places in Singapore. 4.5 km of climbing and I was ready to go much more but didn't have time special and memorable day dream to go back again😍
,,It was an experience we weren't expecting,4.0,,"We took a little while to figure out where an entrance to the reservoir was but we ended finding a trail that lead us in the reservoir. It was a very humid day for the 11km walk. Make sure you bring the following items: big bottle of water, mozzie repellent and good comfy shoes. We went through the treetop walk - it wasn't really worth it, just a bridge. It's ok to do it in conjunction with the reservoir but I wouldn't bother to go to reservoir if you just wanted to go to the treetop.

We saw monkeys, snakes, lizards and a massive ant. Just be careful about the monkeys because we were trying to get past a few of them and I think the parent was getting aggressive so we backed away.

Good workout if you want to see the green side to Singapore - it's probably a good idea to do this is if you've been to Singapore a few times already."
,,Hot walk,4.0,,"Bring your comfy shoes and water bottle, very pleasant walk around the circuit and over a suspension bridge. Walk takes about 4/5 hours, a little exhausted by the end of the walk, but well worth the effort. Not many birds but plenty of monkeys to see."
,,great workout,4.0,,"if this is you don't have much time in Singapore and it's your first time here Macritchie probably isn't a priority. The treetop walk is a great free attraction but you do have to walk about 4km to get there and the entire loop is 11km and takes about 3.5-4hrs to complete. Also be aware the treetop walk is closed Mondays and is only open 9-5 on other days (830am weekends) Its a relatively easy walk with just a few hills, not particularly scenic, mostly you are walking through forest or around the lake, so more just physical workout than tourist attraction (besides the treetop walk, which can also be accessed more easily by car/taxi. The closest MRT is about 15-20m walk from Macritchie Park Entrance)
Also.There are monkeys which appear if you produce any food!"
,,Greenery,5.0,,Its a great place for trekking. Good for someone adventurous. Level of difficulty i would rate 3.5/5.
,,Beautiful,3.0,,Place is so beautiful and quite and monkeys around make the place more fun to visit.The water catchment areas is so peaceful and calm.
,,Good Place to Appreciate & Get Close To Nature!,4.0,,"The reservoir is located close to the central part if Singapore, near Toa Payoh and Thomson area.

People usually come here in the mornings and evenings when its cooler, for walks for runs.

You can enjoy walks along the broadwalks along the reservoir edge, or take a hike/ run/ cycle through nature trails through the nature reserve.

Along the way, you can spot monkeys, birds and wildlife.

This is a good place to appreciate & get close to nature!"
,,Love to go there for a run,4.0,,"I usually do the 11km route around the lake. It is most of the time under the trees so shadowy and not too hot.
i like to go running there, some people go there for a walk but it's a bit long for me to take my young kid there. The tree top walk is really worth it though."
,,nature,5.0,,Be prepared to walk and be in touch with nature. Good structure in rangers point. Lots of monkeys! Nature in the middle of skyscrapers and concrete jungle. Don't feed the monkeys!
,,Romantic and Breezy Reservoir,5.0,,"This place use to be and still is lovers hangout. But now more of a jogging track with nice bird catching view and nature. Lots of planning and thoughts were put into this place. There is hiking, Water sports, Bird watching, exercise and lots of monkeys.
(Go to this link: https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/macritchie-reservoir-park)"
,,Must go to see in Singapore~!,5.0,,Can go by MRT (10 minutes by foot Cadecott or Marymount stations). Need time for trekking around 4~6 hours.
,,Monkeys!,5.0,,"On our way to the reservoir we were greeted by a sign cautioning against the thieving nature of the local monkeys which as a self-confessed monkey-enthusiast, only increased my excitement to see them. We arrived at the reserve and saw half a dozen climbing all over the visitor centre! It was an incredible experience, and as we came back from a short walk around the reservoir, we spotted a large group (10+) of monkeys just hanging out in the sun by the path! There were even little baby monkeys riding on their mother's backs. Super experience, would 100% recommend to anyone with a passing interest in monkeys."
,,Monkeys,4.0,,"we often walked the resovior when we lived in Singapore, we went to look for 'old times'sake, we were not dissapointed the monkeys are still as cheeky as ever..nice jungle and water a relaxing place.."
,,If you have the time do enjoy the walk into the forest,3.0,,An interesting place with a long history. You can find restaurant there now so you do not have to worry about food. It will be good if you can spend sometime walking into the forest to enjoy the greenery.
,,Serene and Lovely to walk about,4.0,,"If you are looking for a time away from the hustle and bustle, this is an ideal place to relax the tired mind and eyes. Go walk around and enjoy the serenity."
,,beautiful hiking spot,5.0,,"We did the 12km loop around the reservior, it is so beautiful and peaceful, an easy flat walk which is clearly signposted. You would never know you were in the middle of a busy city, surrounded by deep green forest, monkeys and birds everywhere. They even have clean toilets and chilled water fountains available on the way to the treetop walk! A fantastic way to spend a day in Singapore."
,,Unspoiled Open Space & Greenery,4.0,,"This was a surprise in tiny Singapore. One has a real sense of space and being in a wilderness. The walk was great, especially the tree bridge walk. All free."
,,This is what Singapore looked like before colonisation!,4.0,,"Well worth a visit, wonderful trek. It will require a reasonable level of fitness to make the full 10ish k's walk.Sore knees or hips at the start could be a mistake. Please take plenty of water as there is only one drinking fountain/toilet stop on the way around. We are in our fifties and took four hours to complete the walk. Saw monkeys in jungle. There is a "" socialise"" troop to the north west of the dam wall,if you are short of time."
,,Boardwalk runs are great,4.0,,"The long boardwalks around the lake are great to run on. There are no safety rails, so you should be careful"
,,Great jungle walk,5.0,,Fab place to get some exercise and see some local wildlife. We love bumping in to the local monkeys and seeing beautiful lizards and snakes.
,,Nice place from bustling city,5.0,,"Great place to go for a stroll. Tree top walk is a must. Recommend packing an umbrella, water and some munchies to keep you from hunger,thirst and rain. Highly recommended."
,,Nature in the city,5.0,,"A very different way to enjoy Singapore. You cannot even imagine that something like that is in the middle of this modern city. Pure jungle, with monkeys, lizards and elephants and tigers (OK, I am just overexcited now...). Jokes aside, real nature in an urban landscape like Singapore, an oasis, a place to be lost for a while and think about how this place used to be decades ago..."
,,Off the beaten place!,5.0,,"There's also a cafe called The Mushroom Cafe which serves local dishes and fried finger foods. - See more at: http://frenzeelo.blogspot.sg/2012/05/macritchie-reservoir.html#sthash.JC6zPswe.dpuf

and switch to bus #74 or #157 along Bukit Timah Road. Both buses will take you straight to the bus-stop mentioned by BornVivant at the entrance to the park.

do not enter when it's going to rain and please wear comfortable clothing and shoes. - See more at: http://frenzeelo.blogspot.sg/2012/05/macritchie-reservoir.html#sthash.JC6zPswe.dpuf

This place is popular place among for locals and runners. I can't believe I am in Singapore. There are many monkeys there. Kids love that.

There's also a cafe called The Mushroom Cafe which serves local dishes and fried finger foods.

Note: Don't enter this place when it t's going to rain
You should wear comfortable clothing and shoes as you will walk a lot. Bring more water

How to get there: take bus #74 or #157. They will stop at the entrance to the park."
,,One of the best and most serene spots in SG! Love the Tree Top Walk!,5.0,,"MacRitchie is an amazing place for an active weekend - its lush green surroundings and a beautiful lake make it an ideal place for joggers, painters and even for picnics. There are a couple of hiking trails which are pretty good and one can also go Kayaking (just S$15 bucks for an hour!).

Besides this - the main attraction at MacRitchie is the Tree Top Walk. The 4KM hike to this is totally worth the beautiful view!"
,,Boardwalks for a relaxing walk,3.0,,"The boardwalks for a pleasant stroll around the resevoir. The tracks seemed rather dull from a nature point of view and many joggers going past - it depends what you are after. We like to see the wildlife so the boardwalks were a perfect option for us for a couple of hours. Many monkeys, water monitors, lizards and terrapin's to see. Many birds in the trees to listen to, too. We took a taxi to and from our hotel to the reserve - it was inexpensive."
,,Peacuful place away from all the noise,5.0,,"Amazing place for running & walking in the midst of all the nature. Very peaceful especially walking by the reservoir. Its a 10 km walk and took us almost 5 hours to complete the whole round, including the tree top walk. Great activity for a group of friends on the weekends."
,,Get away from city!!,4.0,,"An ideal get away retreat from the City, and this place is not too far away from the city
A huge jungle with trial for you to explore, a loved place for joggers and hikers

You can surprise with monkeys, and at the right time, the numbers can be quite staggering. do remember not to expose your food (especially fruits), they can be lured to you, and could get kind of ""aggressive""
My son was carrying a bag of fruits, and the monkeys probably can smell it, and tend to get closer and approached him

If you are preparing for a long walk, do prepare for more drinking water"
,,Hidden Gem,4.0,,"If you like running, this is a great place with wonderful trails through the rain forest. The developed park is very nice. This park is more natural than the other developed parks, but if that is what you like, then you will really enjoy walking through this park."
,,Retreat away from Concrete Jungle,5.0,,"I spend most weekends walking around this haven of natural bush-land and beautiful walks! The monkeys, and tree top walk are amazing!"
,,GREAT city escape,5.0,,Amazing hiking and a chance to walk through the rainforest. The trails or various lengths to easily find one to fit your fitness level. The plants are beautiful and monkeys are plentiful to see. I easily caught a cab there but had to walk a fair distance to get a bus or cab back.
,,Nice,3.0,,"My office was close to this and I like this place for a stroll, refreshing experience to walk along the reservoir"
,,Haven of peace in Singapore - and monkeys!,5.0,,"Easy to get to (at the top end of Thomson Rd) and worth visiting. There are a number of different trails you can take so you can do a short walk or go in for the long haul! There is a brilliant tree top walk which takes a bit of getting to but affords amazing views over the reservoir. However you don't have to go to that much effort if you prefer an easier stroll, the reservoir itself is just inside the gates and there's a short boardwalk you can take which is just as lovely as the longer trails. You will likely come across monkeys at the reservoir - read the signs on the way in and act appropriately! A lovely quiet spot in the middle of Singapore - there's also a café (Mushroom Café) which although a bit basic in terms of food, provides welcome shade and cold drinks. There's also a more upmarket restaurant which can be booked."
,,Nice place to relax for a day,5.0,,"We visited MacRitchie Reservoir with couple of friends & their families. We had kids in the age group of 2-8 years in our group. It was a nice place. Not much crowded. There are so many things to do around this place. There is the famous Tree Top Walk which can take between 3-4 hours based on the chosen route. There are multiple walking options along the reservoir which are quite convenient. One of the attractions is the zigzag bridge. We spent most of our time in the area beyond the zigzag bridge which leads to a walk along the promenade and a jungle walk as well.
On the other side of the reservoir, after crossing the dam there are options for doing fishing & kayaking as well. We did not get enough time to try this. Also kayak was closed during the time due to Chinese new year holidays.
The reservoir is also famous for the sunset view with photographers. The place has a sense of calmness about it. While walking along the wooden walk area you feel quite pleased in the surroundings.
There are very few options for food. If you are planning for a day long trip it might be better to carry your food with you which is what we did. We will definitely visit the place again to cover the areas we could not cover during our last visit."
,,PERFECT GEAWAY FROM THE CITY,5.0,,good place for joggers. tretop walk is simply a feel-good experience. Awesome for all ages. Highly recommended!
,,Macritchie reservoir,4.0,,The reservoir is serene and good for joggers. There are exercise park and tale about an hour to run round the reservoir. It will be good if there is rental bikes for one to cycle around
,,"Stunning views, not many tourists.",4.0,,"It's a great place to go to if you want to get away from the city. Beautiful nature, many trails, great views. Not so many tourists, you can immerse in nature."
,,Best nature trail..,5.0,,Tree top walk is like walk in the heaven...everywhere trail info available...walking on wooden trail...is awesome..
,,Beautiful,5.0,,A great spot. It is a long walk to take plenty of water and wear good shoes. Visit early when it is cooler.
,,Nice area for walking on a sunny weekend day,5.0,,"Just great place, we saw the monkeys at our hiking starting point to the hanging bridge. We took public transport (nearest MRT station)"
,,Be prepared for a good long walk,4.0,,"not for the faint hearted, circumnavigate the reservoir and take in the HSBC Canpopy walk - take lots of water and should take 3-4 hours depending on your speed."
,,Get out and about rather than staying in the Mall with your kids,5.0,,"Unbeknown to most people in Singapore we actually have plenty of places to go with lots of greenery and peaceful atmosphere. MacRitchie is probably the most commercial of the reservoirs here (apart from the Marina now of course) but is still peaceful and a nice place to go for a walk. Plenty of boardwalks, forrest tracks, loads of monkeys and wildlife and sometimes some water sports on the reservoir. We always say it is such a shame whenever we go how few families you see with their kids, what a great place to go with them and get out into nature for a while instead of staying in playing on gadgets or sitting in a Mall....

Highly recommend locals and visitors alike to get out to any of the reservoirs for a nice walk and see what is left of some natural Singapore"
,,great,4.0,,"really a place to visit when you live in singapore. as a tourist i would say, visit Malaysia or Indonesia. More and much better nature places to visit in those countries"
,,Ideal for a group picnic,5.0,,"This is Singapore's first reservoir built in late 1860s. It has since been expanded twice to cater to the growing demand if water on the city.
The park is smack in the centre of the city state Singapore and is a huge nature reserve with a beautiful lake in middle.
Last great place for family outing with kids or friends or a couple as well as solo.

What to do there ?
You can go with a group of friends for a half / full day picnic... Find a shade below a tree and enjoy.
Beware of monkeys if you plan to picnic closer to the nature reserve. Avoid feeding them. Loose plastic bags attract them.

The leisurely walk around the convenient walkway on perimeter of the reservoir is a bliss.

You can kayak or go for tree top walking. To get to tree top walk- you have to walk 3.5-4.5 km depending on your starting point. The last entry to the walk is 4:45 pm.

How to get there?
The car park and entry is bang opposite Mount Alvernia Hospital.
By MRT: 10-12 mins walk from Caldecott MRT
By Bus: There is a bus stop less than a minute from the park entry.
By Taxi: Is conveniently located and should cost less than $15/- from most places in city.

Facilities:
Toilets are far and few between.
There is a cafe (Cafe Vava), but is to bring your own food for flexibility.

Tip:
To enjoy most, go on a big group picnic."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Need to get here by train or taxi but well worth the visit. Saw lots of wildlife, and lovely gardens. A relaxing place to visit and a must if you have the time"
,,Flowers at their best,4.0,,A beautiful array of flowers from all over the world. If you like photography you will love this attraction. You just amble through the flower done and enjoy the colour and splender
,,Pretty awful,2.0,,"The place is difficult to get to and nobody seems to know where the entrance is - if you must go, take a taxi. While the reservoir itself is pretty, the nature walks are awful: very, very humid with terrible paths. There is nowhere to get water,go to the toilet or even and a lack of seating to boot. Even the monkeys are unfriendly. This is by far the worst thing that I've done in Singapore."
,,a popular haunt of expats and a few tourists,5.0,,"I was amazed that it was possible to find peace and solitude in the heart of Singapore. There were a few monkeys on the track. The HSBC canopy walk is great. Best to take water and a picnic and pace yourself and spend a whole day walking around the reservoir, but if you haven't the time, there are shorter waslks."
,,Birding at MacRitchie,4.0,,"This is a large park and forest area in Singapore .There is a good number of trails and a long boardwalk around the lake .Lots of locals are present in the morning doing various excercises ,but they are generally gone by mid-morning and are quite interesting to watch anyway.There are quite a few monkeys in the park ,which you are asked not to feed ,as they have become a little to accustomed to humans and on occasions get a little aggressive .This should not put anybody off visiting ,as it is a very picturesque area and well worth a visit and the monkeys will not bother you unless you try and feed them. .Birders should see plenty of species here too .Without a car ,it takes a little pre-planning with bus routes ,but it is not too difficult and a taxi from the nearest MRT station would not be expensive."
,,great place for morning short trail,5.0,,"if you love nature and birds, this might be the best place. Its a short trails with beautiful landscape and clean reservoir. If you love to take pictures of landscape and nature, you will love it."
,,Well landscaped and absolutely free,4.0,,"MacRitchie Reservoir Park is pretty much in the centre of the island and, in many ways, plays a central role in the daily lives of Singaporeans. Water is a constant concern at the local level as the city state consumes far more than it is able to produce. A vast amount of the water that is consumed or used on a daily basis comes from neighbouring Johor state in Malaysia.

The park itself offers often stunning views of the reservoir and there are plenty of places to simply 'stand and stare'. I would recommend the 10km walk around the reservoir. It is long, hot and often sweaty but the varied terrain and interesting sights are well worth it. Part of the walk can include the tree tops walk which takes you, as the name suggests, up through the canopy in one part of the park. You also get a good dose of local wildlife including the resident macaques and numerous (and often quite large) monitor lizards. With the monitors, you often hear them before you see them as they tend to react to the walker's movements. They can give you quite a shock as they rustle off into the undergrowth although there is nothing to fear.

My most interesting, if rather scary, moment was coming across a king cobra. I rather like reptiles so I stayed and watched as it moved quite rapidly across my path and into the undergrowth. I am sure I would have felt differently if it had decided to challenge my presence but the general guide with wildlife is to 'live and let live'. On this occasion, we went our separate ways."
,,Singapore forests seen from a lake.,4.0,,"See rainforest with some interference from early settlers (a few rubber trees remain), while walking around the reservoir. Enjoy boardwalks with views across the lake, or walk along forest trails.
The reservoir serves two purposes for visitors. First it’s a useful way to enjoy the natural environment – rare in Singapore, and it’s also a place to exercise in the clean air.
Being Singapore, you won’t be surprised to know there are plenty of informative notice boards about the vegetation. This is a great place to learn about the rainforest.
If you’re only in Singapore for a few days, the city really deserves more of your attention. However, if living here or on a long visit, you really should come, and see the beauty of the woods which used to cover Singapore.
On practical points. The bus brings you to the main centre, with a cafe, toilets and showers, and lockers.
The cafe serves a small range of tasty meals and drinks (we thought the fish was disappointing, but liked everything else we tasted).
After you leave this centre, there is no other place to obtain any drinks, no dispensing machines, water fountains, nothing. So make sure you have enough to drink and carry water for longer walks. Also there are no toilets except at the centre.
There are plenty of places to sit on the boardwalks around the lake, but we found no seats on the forest trails.
Bring mosquito repellent. Watch out for monkeys; do read the advice on dealing with them. Don’t carry plastic bags or carrier bags, as they know they contain food, and they will snatch them. And please, for the sake of future visitors, never feed them.
We’ve been there several times, and find we can spend the best part of a day there, enjoying relaxing walks by the lake."
,,wilderness in the City,5.0,,What an amazing place to visit I go every weekend to walk the nature trail 11.5 km all the way round & you also check out the HSBC tree top walk take plenty of water & good stout footwear but not to be missed if visiting Singapore & want a beautiful walk through Jungle trails
,,Am I really in Singapore?,5.0,,"So my friends who live here advised me to go and check it out and I am so glad I did. When I arrived it didn't feel quite as exotic or remote as they had explained as there were a lot of people, there was kayaking going on in the reservoir, playground for kids etc. However if you decide to walk one of the nature trails there, then I realised what my friends meant. The place is beautiful and you cant believe you have the big and vibrant city if Singapore about a 15min taxi journey away. There is the opportunity to see monkeys, hear several different bird and see some if you are lucky, comodo dragons (well similar reptile) and other animals. If you choose to do the long nature trail along with the tree top walk, then make sure you take a lot of water. The heat will get to you! Great for those who are also brave enough to go cross country running!"
,,For a relax stroll,4.0,,Great place for a tranquil retreat brimming with lush tropical greenery and surronded by wildlife can make you relax and take your mind away from the busy city life in Singapore.
,,NiceTree top walk,5.0,,"Done the tree top walk with wife and my cousin, lovely walk away from the shops, lots of steps. I have COPD (asthma) done the walk with no problem but had to walk slowly going up. Lots of people jogging. Taken the all morning to do it. You can do this walk with young children. Take some mosquito repellent."
,,Cool place for walking and enjoying nature,5.0,,"Long walk around one of singapore's reservoirs, with lots of wildlife (including many monkeys). One of my favourite places in Singapore"
,,Rainforest walk,5.0,,Its about a 3 hour walk starting at the MacRitchie main entrance to the Tree Top Walk and back. Nice mid-urban N walk through a rainforest
,,Excellent walk,5.0,,"This is a 12km walk. Theres a small cafe with a few snacks near the taxi drop off point but other than that nowhere to replenish refreshments so be sure to take plenty of water with you. Most of the walk is shaded but there are parts that are exposed to the sun so sun block is advised. If your nervous of heights skip the tree top walk but try to do it as its a great view. Theres lots of wildlife, birds terrapin and monkeys. I've been on this walk few times and on one occasion the monkeys were everywhere. Stay calm and if you come across them then let them move on past you."
,,Love this place,4.0,,"Not just because it's walking distance from where I am staying (at least for me). It's a place to enjoy the greenery, breeze and away from the bustle and hassle."
,,Back in touch with nature,4.0,,"Tree top walk, go for your hike-cum-run, canoeing, brisk walking, fishing, watching the sunset... anything you wish to do, this place is a lovely area to just escape for a while from a mad rushing world, just at the peripheries of the reservoir."
,,Good walk,5.0,,"Hope you love monkeys ,they live there and run wild. The walk round the reservoir is a long walk in the heat ,so remember to take water. Easy to get there on the bus."
,,Balancing ...,4.0,,This being the oldest reservoir on this island that the authority taken great pain to ensure the user-friendliness of the park by improved the facilities while maintaining the natural beauty of it.
,,Numerous different trails make for an excellent day out,5.0,,"A large reservoir featuring a park and nature reserve, with numerous trails of varying lengths up to 11km. We started our walk by the main entrance and chose the Petai Trail which is about 3km in length, and consists of a raised broadwalk along the waters edge. Along the way we saw groups of monkeys, lizards, and numerous varieties of birds. It was an easy level walk with just a few steps along the way, but it was slippery in places where the broadwalk was wet. At the end of the Petai Trail we joined the MacRitchie Trail, which is mainly made up of loose stones, and continued our walk to the Tree Top walk. The area has a couple of restaurants and toilet facilities. Overall the reservoir offers a variety of walks, which seemed popular with both walkers and joggers. To get to the main entrance we took the MRT to Dhoby Ghaunt, and then bus 162 or 162M direct to the entrance."
,,Back to nature,5.0,,"Brilliant day out. Did the 11k walk around the resourvior and we had the best time ever. So much to see. Monkeys in their natural habitat. Monitor Lizards and other creepy crawlies. Also did the Tree Top suspension bridge walk as well and it was well worth it. Set off in 35 degrees sunshine and finished it in in torrential thunderstorm but it didnt spoil it one bit.
Places to eat but right at the begining or the end. Welcome Rangers station stopping place to get drinking water and toilet facilities
Easily accessible by bus or taxi"
,,Nature escape,5.0,,"One of the best places in Singapore, with most character.

It's a lovely area with a trekking path all around the lake, so you can end up spending an entire day at this peaceful reservoir.

When we visited there were monkeys free-roaming all around, and a lot of youngsters playing in the trees and near the water. It was wonderfully adorable to see something like that in the middle of a busy city.

Best of all, it's free!"
,,Change your attitude about Singapore when you visit here!,5.0,,I choose this place for free day when I was in Singapore. Nature hides in the city atmosphere. You should try the trail which lead you to the lovely treetop walk. The distance around 9.6 km.
,,Close to nature,4.0,,Was brought there by a colleague for a morning jog. The trail was not complicated and not too tough. Very nice scenery especially when you approach the reservoir area.
,,Bring nature close to you,4.0,,"When we visit Singapore, since Mac Ritchie is close to apartment we stay, we will take afternoon walk there. Walk to the forest and enjoy the variety of plant with our kids, it is both healthy and educational for them.
If you are tired, just sit by the edge of the walk path along the reservoir, some times the monkey will come to you."
,,Nature escape close to the city,4.0,,"One day I noticed that one of the busses that I regularly take (130) passes the MacRitchie Reservoir. On a whim we decided the same day to check it out.
It was a Sunday, but it was abolutely not crowded. We combined the nature trail, the treetop walk, the golf track and some board walks to make our way all around the reservoir. We did around 13 km, and it took us about three hours at a very easy pace. The track is well maintained and easy to walk. A few times (especially around the treetopwalk), there were sections with a seriies of stairs. These were the only sections that were a bit more difficult.

The walk itself is very pleasant, with monkeys in certain areas, lots of bird life, lizards and tortoises. Most of the path is shaded, so you can do the walk on a warm day.

The track is not accessible by wheelchair, and I would recommend to wear closed shoes because some sections are made of small stones that would work their way into sandals.
Take enough water because there are no shops around the reservoir and just one little foodcourt stall who sells some drinks and ice creams."
,,Road Less Traveled,5.0,,"Whether you are a fitness guru or casual walker, I highly suggest you escape the city and adventure to the MacRitchie Reservoir. There were several people that decided to do the same, but it never felt crowded. Everyone was quite respectful as well.

We decided to go to the MacRitchie Reservoir to see the TreeTop walk and wild monkeys roaming around. The reservoir did not disappoint. The TreeTop walk was definitely worth the extra hike, and it was our first time seeing monkeys in the wild. This attraction was one of the highlights of our trip!"
,,Nice walk,5.0,,It was one morning that me and my friends decided to walk around here. The place is neat and nice and relaxing and refreshing. Will comeback to do biking here next time
,,One of the best nature reserve,4.0,,"Went for a trail run on a beautiful Monday morning, cool weather and friendly people all around. Worth the sweat going the tough nature trail through the nature reserve towards the 'treetop' bridge.

Where else can you get fresh air, beautiful nature all for free. Warning the nature trail is not for those with bad knees."
,,Escape the city madness,4.0,,"Just went for a run at the park yesteday. I wish i had discovered this place earlier. Its close to the city and yet it feels so far. Nice and tranquil, very lush and includes a big lake. It is also dog friendly. However some area are restricted for dogs. Go nice and early before the Singpore heat kicks in to enjoy a run or a stroll. There is also exercise equipment that can be used free of charge and a cafe called mushroom cafe so cheap eats, nothing fancy. High recommended if you wish to find some peace and not see and building in the backdrop. There place even has monkeys wondering around,"
,,Nice Park- Good for Nature Lovers and Excercise Enthusiastic,4.0,,"Should be favourite with exercise enthusiastic and nature loving.
Attraction is Suspension Bridge at Tree Top in the reservoir. It is a track f about 6 Kms from MacRitchie Reservoir Park entrance or about 4 Km from Venus Drive Par entrance.
There are different trails with different degree of difficulties. I would suggest take the trail of 5.9 Kms to HSBC Tree Top and on return see Jelutong Tower and come back to Venus drive Park.
Last about 200 Mts top Suspension Bridge is difficult so be prepared for it. Entrance is one way and you come out by climbing about 150 Steps up the slopes and about 200 steps down the slope. This is the most tedious part of the trail.
There are about 120 steps for Jelutong Tower. It gives a good view of the reservoir and the forest. Good for Nature loving.
It is closed on Monday and opens at 9AM to 5PM (Tuesday to Fri) and 0830 AM to 5 PM (Sat, Sun & Public Holidays)"
,,Great place to spend some time outdoors.,4.0,,"In summary: great for get some outdoor exercise and enjoy some of the Singapore wildlife.

We started at the Venus Road card park off Upper Thompson and set out on the Treetop trail. It took about 40 minutes to reach the treetop walk along a well worn paths, you need to keep your eye out for the signs as you could easily be heading off in the wrong direction at some of the interchanges.

After the treetop bridge lots of steps up and down to get back to the main trails. It's then boardwalk most of the way to MacRitchie Reservoir across what would have been a swamp. Some interesting facts along the trail about the plant and wildlife. We were lucky enough to see monkeys, small shiny lizards, tadpoles and monitor lizards.

Walking round the reservoir is really peaceful, good paths and boardwalk available all round the waters edge. Overall took us 2.5 hours to complete the circle but I should say we do walk at a pace."
,,"Beautiful, quiet park",4.0,,"The main reason for our visit to the MacRitchie Park was to walk along the 250m tree top walk which is a long bridge built in the canopy layer of the forest, the view from the bridge is outstanding. You can see Malaysia and Singapore from the bridge! The park is very quiet as not many tourists visit it. Entry is free. There is a small eating place at the entrance selling drinks and hot food. The walk to the tree top walk is 6km. 5km of which is through a forest which is home to monkeys which you will come across. The monkeys are not scared of people as they will just sit in the middle of the path. There are several warning signs and instructions available in the park telling you how to deal with the wildlife. It took us 3.5 hours to walk 12km which took us to the tree top walk and then back out of the park (along the same path). All in all, wear sturdy trainers as the terrain is rather rough and bring a bottle, there are several refill stations available. However if you're not up to the walk I wouldn't recommend this as even though the view is nice, you may not think it is worth it!"
,,Great outdoor entertainment in the city,5.0,,The dense jungle was enough to block out the traffic and forget that you are in the middle of a city. The boardwalk and general facilities are well maintained and clean.
,,Nice but very long trip,5.0,,After a busy week I decided to check out this place and I have to say that it was a nice but very long unexpectedly exhausting walk. I could be my fault simply - so therefore i still consider it a great adventure. In the middle of the jungle I made it to the tree top walk ( with my mom who is 65!). The walk itself is good- it get a bit tricky up to the tree top walk because its uphill. Some crazy fit jiggers actually run there. I wish I could : the tree top walk is not as impressive as I thought but has a beautifull view followed by some kind of learning trail which was interesting. From there it's a long way to the exit so I decided to climb up to the road and ended up next to the SG golf club. Good landmark for taxis! Nice and exhausting adventure. If you wanna save some breath start from Venus drive. And: bring enough water and some snacks with you! I would not recommend it for kiddies though...
,,nice greenery in SG,4.0,,"it's very quiet and serene. Try go here if you want to trail, jog, or just chill out in the lush greenery. I sat there under the shade and read and listened to music, it was a wonderful experience. It's a bit difficult to reach. I went there by mrt (alight at the Caldecott MRT) and got lost a bit and walked a long long way to finally get there :( but the walk was worth it.. it was very enjoyable to stay for some time here... to enjoy the scenery, to enjoy the soothing quiet atmosphere of the reservoir. just go here in the morning or noon or afternoon. Dont risk yourself going here when it gets dark, though. There is also fitness trail in the area where you can do exercises like chin up, push up etc with the equipment installed there."
,,Away from the stress of the bustling city,5.0,,Nice place to hike and soak in the tranquility of the forest and lake. The tree top walk is on one of the route and its well marked.
,,Tranquility,4.0,,"Good place to come for some quality family time with young children. Look at they monkeys, turtles, fish, squirrels and the odd iguana or watch people rowing on the lake."
,,Beautiful park . .,4.0,,"This is a fantastic green area, a short journey from the hustle and bustle of Orchard Rd. Its a great place to go for a hike,jog or leisurely walk through the forest up to the tree top bridge or surrounding tracks. All the local sights/walks are very well signposted also,its definitely a must for the active tourists visiting singapore!"
,,Peace to your mind..,4.0,,"When you need some time out from Ur busy schedule, you need some peace of mind. They MacRitchie Reservoir is the place u look for. Me and my friends planned for a picnic to this spot and must say it turned out to be a great decision. This place is not at all crowded.
Bedsides the natural green ambiance it provides you option for hiking, Kayaking.. Etc. Kayaking was a fun event, no long queue.

But ya be careful of the monkeys around. They are fearless here.."
,,Nice place to hike,5.0,,"Unfortunately our time was very limited, but we were able to walk the Petai Trail and visit the pavilion. Great views over the water and in the forest we saw animals like squirrel, salamander, lizards and birds. Even for a short visit definitely worth it! Be cautious for monkeys if you have food in your bags!"
,,Lovely hiking place,5.0,,"Place is very scenic with lots of nature and monkeys. Even in extreme heat, the whole trails are coverable. the reservoir itself is so beautifully made and we always relish this place..."
,,Always my choice of running place,5.0,,"It has always been a great place for my running routine, it's a big place to do your running and look at the scenery, try it out someday!"
,,Good day trip,4.0,,MacRitchie Reservoir us a very nice natural destination to time to escape on weekend or even holiday. The good trip for people who want to get some nature.
,,lovely!,5.0,,"this is my first time walking through a bridge within 2 hours, which is unforgettable memory. the tree top walk is rank among 50 activities you should do in singapore."
,,You will return,5.0,,"A piece of unspoiled nature. We could hardly believe this was within a city state. We strolled the edge of the reservoir, hiked the 16 km trail through Treetop Walk - the Macritchie Nature Trails are right next to the reservoir. Wild monkeys (uninterested in humans, yay!), giant lizards, litter-free, plenty of shadow beneath trees. Near the reservoir is also a café with very affordable yet delicious food. We happily returned."
,,Another great place to exercise,5.0,,"Normally I walk at the Botanic Gardens, this time I joined my wife at MacRitchie and it was a great change...we took the harder rough trail course for about 8 km and although not so much to see was a really good workout...they also have the flatter boardwalk trail which I will try next time..

Can recommend as it nicely compliments the Botanic Gardens for a variety of places to exercise."
,,Get place for running,5.0,,Really good for running. We did the 11 km which goes around the edge. Some sections a bit challenging to run because of the uneven ground.
,,Good relaxation for all ages.,4.0,,Good place to really relax and bring yourself closer to mother nature... But do refrain from feeding the wild monkeys as they will bother you if you feed... lol
,,Reservior,4.0,,See the city type of reservoir and take a stroll there. Easy to get there from the city and enjoy the nature. Early morning nice!
,,Mac Ritchi - A jogger's paradise,5.0,,"MacRitchie is one of those places in Singapore that I wish to go again and again. A large reservoir surrounded by plenty of trees and greenery and a long, never ending trail to walk through the forest is like a treasure box, more you explore, the more you get.
Best to visit on non-sunny days geared with sports shoes, water bottle sun glasses and a camera to capture the beautiful scenery.
Arriving at Macritchie, you'll be welcomed by lots of monkeys, so ensure that your food and other valuable items are tucked inside your bag."
,,A little piece of nature in the big city,5.0,,"This was by far our favorite attraction in Singapore. A very easy 5 - 10k walk depending on the route you take. We choose to make our way to the TreeTop walk, a high suspension bridge filled with monkeys and incredible views.

Useful tips:
- Avoid bringing plastic bags as it excites the monkeys and although they are cute they are also aggressive in this area
- Wear bug spray
- Bring lots of water, its really humid and sweating is part of the deal"
,,Interesting Attraction for Small Children - Natural Paradise in a Big City,5.0,,"We went for a morning walk with our grand children in MacRitchie Reservoir. The children love this place - it's got everything: lovely nature trails, monkeys, tree top walk, lakes full of fish, great species of bamboo and other rain forest trees. It is a favourite place for photographers searching for shots of butterflies etc. A must visit when you want a rest from all the shopping centre activities. A very relaxing place.

Early morning is the best time to walk in this park as walking in Singapore can be a bit hot later in the day. This pathways have lots of shade and interesting things to see and enjoy."
,,Get lost in nature right next to the city,4.0,,"This should be a quick taxi ride from wherever you're staying, and it a great place for a bit of peace and quiet away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Plan to go early or late, because the middle of the day can get pretty hot. There's plenty to do here, but the main attraction are the nature trails; plan to walk about 11-12km if you want to start at the reservoir and see the Tree Top Walk. You can also take kayaking lessons at the reservoir itself."
,,Good walking but beware the monkeys!,4.0,,"Great place for a walk and breath of fresh air. There is reasonable parking, taxi drop off and buses nearby. Several trails of varying length but about 11km all the way around with also a tree top walk. Much of the boardwalk is in shade and easily accessible for all including pushchairs but the longer paths can get a bit muddy so do wear trainers/sensible shoes. Do keep to the well signposted paths and do not feed the monkeys. If you take a picnic then keep it hidden away not in plastic bags. There was a small café with snacks and drinks, toilets etc. Lots of people exercising and jogging but also places to sit quietly and watch the dragonflies, fish, turtles etc."
,,Wish we'd discovered MacRitchie sooner!,5.0,,"Only a $10 taxi ride from Robertson quay, MacRitchie seems a world away from the usual hustle and bustle of Singapore city! We walked to the HSBC treetop walk then back around the reservoir, all in all was about an 11km walk ounce the tree top walk was included. The paths are really well signed and the walking trail is well maintained. We saw many monkeys along the way, maybe 3-4 different kinds, we saw huge lizards (looked like goannas but not sure what they were) and turtles in the park at the end. The walk itself is very easy going, but be sure to bring plenty of water as it was very very hot and humid (as could be expected). The views from the tree tops walk should not be missed....though maybe not for those with a fear of heights!"
,,plenty of things to do!,5.0,,"The Good =)
~Cheap activities...some even for free!
~Encouraging to see crowds of people exercising,
at anytime & at anywhere!

The Bad =(
~Crowded during weekends.
~Limited parking during weekends.

My Tip for future visits:
~If you want to enjoy aircon-quality temperatures,
visit from 5 to 6.30am, before the sun rises."
,,Lush green jungle,5.0,,"We went for a long walk and tree top walk is very good. Had a bit of trouble with my shoes. Please wear comfortable shoes since the track is mud one and full of rocks. Strictly stick to the track , do not go into the jungle since chances are there you may get lost. On the whole had a good exercise and good breath. My eyes enjoyed the serenity."
,,Untouched and wco friendly place in singapore,5.0,,"I visited the reservoir when I was in singapore. It is a very quiet place and would be an interesting place for nature enthusiasts.
I walked all the 13-14km stretch of the reservoir. I saw a.lot of butterflies and monotor lizards roaming freely. It was like me and nature interacting with the cicadas background score.

The much hyped tree walk isnt that great but the walk was worth it. Carry enough water as you will not find any provisions to refill.

Happy walking..."
,,Good for a quiet walk,4.0,,Nice place for a quit walk and a stroll on a late afternoon. The place is clean and quiet and has shady spots and nice walk ways. Worth a visit.
,,"Excellent place, MacRitchie Reservoir",5.0,,"Excellent place to go to for exercise, jogging, photography, picnic, etc. My granchildren from Hong Kong enjoyed the open space by running all over. The grown-ups just sit there to enjoy the breeze over conversations. It is one of the most peaceful and safe places to be there. My teen-age grandson uses the reservoir to practice rowing for his junior college rowing team. My favourite meeting point with my photography friends, using models for portraiture. One of the attractions is to photograph flowers and insects in the forest. One other attractions is for the seniors to play games of chess under the shady trees and having a nap after a heavy meal."
,,Recommended For Jogging and Nature Lover,4.0,,"If you are a nature lover or want to exercise jogging I recommend this place. Although I am not like this place because I prefer shopping but I admit that the scenery here was very beautiful, the air was very fresh and cool.

One thing I really remember is when I paid for a bus to go back to the nearest MRT station, at that time I paid the money of 20 dollar Singapore but bus driver did not want to accept it, and I did not have a little money at all and I just know that to pay buses in Singapore must be the exact fare, but fortunately a chinese guy who sat in the front seat paid $ 1 for me. Although only $ 1 but I was very impressed and appreciative. Thanks to the people of Singapore."
,,Amazing green rainforest in the middle of the island with monkeys,3.0,,"Amazing day. Did a 12.5km hike. Went up the canopy bridge and the tower. I did twist my ankle so please wear suitable shoes but so worth it. Bring lots of water, sunblock and of course the camera. And ensure you are aware of monkeys and respect how they should be treat in the park. Ensure you know what to do if they approach you and don't take plastic bags- they like them!"
,,"nature's reserve and reservoir,Macritchie",5.0,,"green open spaces with a blue body of clear water is itself a treat in the centre of any bustling city.
beautiful place,enough carparking facilities,gadgets for sports and fitness enthusiasts.nature trails,tree top walks and a good cafe are the highlights of this place.
clean and tidy place as the city is proud to be.spend a leisure evening.dont look at your wrist watch.just surrender to mother Nature.best de stressing place.haven for budding artistes and poets.the calm,serene area may prod them to write better."
,,fun walk,4.0,,"MacRitchie Reservoir Tree Top Trail was fun. The long tailed Macaque monkeys were wild but use to humans. We stayed at the Conrad Centennial Singapore located at Two Temasek Boulevard. We took Bus 980 - Direction: Sembawang Int to MacRitchie Reservoir. The beginning bus stop was on Middle Road close to Beach Road. It took about 30 minutes. The ending bus stop was Opp Flame Tree Pk (i.e. opposite Flame Tree Park). From there, head south on Upper Thomson Rd, right onto Venus Dr (look for the trail head)."
,,My recent visit to MacRitchie Reservoir,5.0,,"MacRitchie Reservoir is a sprawling reservoir at Lornie Road in Singapore. This place has a pub and a cafe. The jungle tracks are ideal for running and jogging. Every morning you can see hundreds of health-conscious joggers taking to the tracks like ducks to water. There is also a rare pitcher plant (Nepenthes gracilis) near the edge of the reservoir. This insectivorous plant has pitchers that trap the unwary fly or mosquito. The Lim Bo Seng tomb is found on a hillock near the forested area. You can view my video on MacRitchie Reservoir at this address:

,,Exercise +,4.0,,"We did the tree top walk which in all was about 8km, however if you don't wish to be so enthusiastic you can walk around the boardwalk or just take a picnic and sit by the side of the water. Lots of monkeys, water monitors etc so just be careful if you have food. The walk is not too strenuous if you decide to do the tree top route but there are lots of stairs. Make sure you wear appropriate footwear and take water with you. There is a water tap at the ranger station, otherwise there are no facilities other than at the front gate. The track can be slippery and muddy in places too so take care."
,,Is this in Singapore?.... A surprise jungle amidst the busy city.. must go.,5.0,,"Wanted to visit McRitchie for very long time.... Could make it today, with not very humid weather. Decided to go solo and wanted to go through different trails. there is a ""Mushroom "" restaurant.All basic food is available there.. More of 100+ and other sports drinks available. Many athletes were already on the roll..!!!..the first sight of the reservoir was very enchanting, with kayaking competition for students. Started off with the easy trail of 3 kms.. then moved on to 5km trail for the HSBC Tree Top. The Tree top experience was good, with 25 m above the forest floor and with slight drizzle, the floor was bit slippery. While coming back from Tree top, on the Sime track, there is option to connect to Bukit Timah Nature reserve(around 5.8 km).

The entire stretch was around 11 KM's and took around 2.5 hours to complete with some pit stops.. Good to go with a group of atleast 2-3 folks. Take enough water with you as possibility of getting dehydrated is very high!!..

On the other side, there is a zigzag bridge, golf course. this place is good for the family with kids."
,,great outdoors in tiny Singapore,5.0,,Gives a great feeing to be here on a holiday or in the mornings to really feel at one with nature. Has lovely running tracks which blend into the nature and one can run around the reservoir for long runs. Marvellous.
,,weekend excapade,3.0,,wear your track shoe if your planning for a weekend workout...check for weather forecast at the trail tend to be slippery when wet.....there was lots of monkeys along the trail so dont let your food exposed as they get tempted to snatch it from u. hydrate as the trail will take some time to finish...sun block will help so as not to suffer from sunburn
,,"Tranquil Retreat, or a Great Workout",5.0,,"A beautiful oasis in an otherwise bustling city, this attraction is easily reached with a short walk from the subway station. By mid moring many of the joggers are already returning from their workouts on the various circuits. There is a small eatery (Mushroom Cafe I think.. near the start: basic cafe food, no awards for gastronomy), and the rubbish bins next door were the first sighting of monkeys. The trail choices are varies, and we did the 11km route in just over 2 hours. As others have adivsed; good shoes (some rocky slopes, some flat boardwalk) and lots of water given the heat and humidity. Earlier in the morning is likely best if choosing the workout, but anytime of day for a leisure stroll works."
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"I couldnt believe there is a jungle in the city and when I walk for 11km in MacRichie Reservoir then I have to admit that Sg is not all about Orchard road. There are wild landscape, beautiful lawn, lakes, natural trail, monkeys, birds... you keep walking and keep being surprised!"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"We went to the MacRitchie nature trail in March 2013. Beautiful scenery-we didn't go on any of the walks as we ran out of time, but if I went back I would. I would reccomend allowign a few hours here-especially if you want to walk around or sit down and enjoy the view. If you feel the heat then I would recommend going early in the day or later on in the day. You might need to get a bus there fro mthe nearest MRT as it would be a bit of a walk but the staff at the station were very helpful and tolkd us which bus to get. To sum it up...if you have spare time and want to do something that is free then it's worth a look."
,,"Tree Top Walk, MacRitchie Reservoir, Singapore",5.0,,"The walkway is a free-standing suspension bridge spanning Bukit Peirce and Bukit Kalang, the two highest points in MacRitchie.

At 25m above the ground, the walkway gives you a closer look at the canopy, where all the action takes place. Here, you also have a better view of some of our forest birds; Colugos (flying lemurs) and Long-tailed macaques (monkeys); view trees from an entirely different angle and enjoy a panoramic view of Upper Peirce Reservoir. Some 80 species of birds and 18 rare trees have been spotted in the forest. The walkway is the first of its kind in Singapore and in the region."
,,nice weekend outing place,5.0,,"good place with family, friends outing. good man-made nature to watch out. depending your timings, you can spend, a complete day here. following tips might be useful to you.
1. you've 3 route options. so decide 1st what you want to do and then take appropriate entry.
2. for 1st time visitor's, theres food court at entry. it provides good map. then you can decide your route.
3. for tree top walking, you need to take different entry point, ..... from island country club road. lornie road access will lead to 11km walking to tree top point.
4. weather is unpredictible. so keep plenty of water with you.
5. you can found monkeys at food court. so be careful, when having food at that food court. even while walking on trail road, you may get chance to see some of monkey. dont feed them, even though they are harmless.
6. authorities preserved the nature. so keep plastic bags with you, for any rubbish.
7. do not create noise pollution by switching-on music.
8. give way to runner's/jogger's.
9. enjoy water sports, beautiful landscape and wild-life. carry a good camera, to capture the moments.

lastly, listen nature's silence."
,,Escape the concrete jungle and go to the real thing!,4.0,,"Just a $7 cab ride from Orchard MRT this is really worth an outing when you have had enough of the man-made stuff. Make sure you pack your walking shoes and LOTS of water and do the 11km circuit up to the tree-tops walk and back. About half way round there is access to a ranger's station for water top up and toilets (splash your face!). You're likely to see wild monkeys, lizards and plenty of birds. A welcome relief from the city. Highly recommended! Don't feed the monkeys though!"
,,"Good place for a walk, run or day out with the kids.",4.0,,Best to go early morning or later in the after noon when the sun is not so hot as it can get very hot there.
,,Beautiful nature. Good to rest and relax here. Athletes will appreciate here.,4.0,,"It is quite far from city, but transportation in Singapore will lead your here easily.

Weather is unpredictable. Sometimes raining and then sunny ! You should prepare umbrella ! There are lush everywhere. Good for picnic.

There are not many activities to do here except experiencing beautiful nature and fresh air. You will like it. Just go and try !"
,,"Best ""guide"" ever: a huge dragon",5.0,,"It was a pleasure walking through the trails and paths over there. The most unexpected meeting was with a huge lizzard, a dragon I think which was absolutely beautiful (and happily shy, too)! Small monkey were everywhere with their curious babies.

A nice and wild escape throught the skyscrapers and hi-tech. Really loved it!"
,,Nature Reserve in the heart of Metropolitan Singapore,5.0,,"Acres of lush green reserve and fresh air. Plenty of space to stretch your legs. However, lots of macaques/monkeys now - so have to be careful if you bring food or packages."
,,You can go tree-climbing here,4.0,,"A lovely lake park area with foot-path all the way around. Perfect for picnics, kayaking or to go tree-climbing with the family."
,,beautiful ambience and close to nature,3.0,,been visiting since school days outing and excursions. always feel close to nature here and bring back some nostalgic memories. there could be some water activities which will enhance the place more. very beautiful and scenenic place to visit
,,Wonderfull sanctuary away from it all!,5.0,,"I was brought here by a friend, and didn't really know what to expect. I was truly amazed by the size of the park, and the fact that it has been left so untouched. The paths are nothing more than just paths through ""real"" jungle, there were plenty of monkeys around. All in all, a great experience, although the trails are pretty long, especially of you are headding for the suspension bridge. Bring lots of water (and perhaps some sunscreen) and make sure you have a lot of time on your hands!"
,,Long trail around it.,4.0,,You can go just for a picnic by the reservoir or for a long walk around. Make sure you bring plenty of water and keep your zippers looked so monkeys cannot get to your things.
,,One of my favourite places in Singapore!,5.0,,A fantastic place to escape to hustle bustle of the city! Great for an early morning walk or run. Almost certain to see monkeys along the way. 10.8km all the way around. 5km to the treetop walk.
,,Lovely nature reserve,4.0,,"This lovely nature reserve is right in the middle of Singapore and well connected by public transport. You should allow yourself a min of 1 hour, but you can easily spend 2 hours (walk to end of boardwalk and return), 3 hours (walk to tree-top trail and loop back) or 4 hours (walk to Bukit Timah). The walking trails are well marked and easy to traverse, but a min level of fitness is expected."
,,macRitchie Reservoir,4.0,,Recent renovations and additions have made this park truly relaxing. Great place to wind-down after a busy day. Kids love it. Walk around the park is great. Weekends very crowded. Good spot for outdoor activities. Be cautious of monkeys. Cycling and fishing recommended.
,,A must-go for runners,4.0,,"This is a great place for runners and trekkers (for safety, just make sure that you are not running alone). You can canoe at MacRitchie Reservoir too. There is a tree-top walk at this place too.

Cafe and bathing facilities are also available here.

Do bring along your insect repellent as there are mosquitoes."
,,A nice get away from uban stress and poluttion,5.0,,In a city like sg all stone fortress get away a bit to MRR is nice located somewher ao accissiable by public bus and got this nice hanging long swing bridges that cut somewhere on the top all over this natural pluto so nice and peacful.
,,"Serene, Natural and Relaxing",5.0,,Great place to get away from the concrete jungle of everyday lives. It is somewhere i go when I just want to relax and get back into the nature even for just a little bit. never fails to liften up my spirits.
,,MIles of peace and relative quiet,5.0,,"MacRitchie provides relief form the pace of Singapore. It is cleverly designed so that you can be wandering through forest paths only meters from residential areas, and be relatively unaware that they are there!
Birds, monkeys, squirrels, other wildlife - no matter how many times I go, it is always a delight. From the cool boardwalks round the southern and easter reaches of the lake through the several kilometers of shaded forest paths, a couple of hours relaxing amongst greenery helps maintain balance from the harassment of Orchard Road where the real wild life lives!
You can take two hours to do the main circuit from main entrance, or go further afield and walk up to Lower Pearce reservoir, west to Bukit Timah Nature Reserve or even take three hours to reach Chua Chiu Kang.
Bukit Timah Reserve is a day's visit in itself with paths leading to an old Dairy Farm across and around Singapore's highest peak.
But MacRitchie? If you like walking, and you like water and you like forests and you like the feeling of being amongst nature, it is worth visiting."
,,Lake Trail,4.0,,Good walking trail around MacRitchie. If you do the full circuit allow 2.5-3 hours and carry plenty of water.
,,quiet and peaceful,4.0,,need a break from all the hustle n bustle of daily stress?? come down here n take a stroll. the serene surrounding n the chirping n buzzing will destress you
,,Peaceful nature reserve,5.0,,"The setting of MacRitchie Reservoir is truly beautiful. The reservoir has a board walk which visitors can walk around. It's teaming with fish, turtles, and if you're very lucky you'll be able to see the resident monitor lizard splashing in the water, trying to get away from people, it's very shy. Be careful not to feed the monkeys that come out in the evening. There are increasing numbers on the board walk who have become used to humans and are sometimes over friendly."
,,Great for a walk / jog,4.0,,"Its about 11km to walk around the reservoir although you can make that a bit longer by adding on e.g. the treetop walk to your route. Part of the trail is along the water and part is through the ""jungle"". You will definitely see monkeys and probably also terrapins and iguanas."
,,Jungle Run!,4.0,,"Coming from Jakarta, it was such a treat to be able to run outside!! The 11K loop around the whole reservoir was well-marked, and lots of people out and about on Sunday morning. The first half (I ran counter-clockwise) was pretty hilly though! A great workout."
,,MacRitchie Reservoir Park/Central Catchment Area (Singapore),4.0,,"Although it is a pristine and well-maintained public park, MacRitchie still harbours a rather diverse range of wildlife. The reason could be it's close proximity to the Central Catchment Area (CCA). In fact the fringe forest of the CCA merge effortlessly into the ""borders"" of the park. The CCA is a fairly large tract of secondary rainforest which also has Singapore's other freshwater reservoirs within it's domain. The more prominent of these large surfaces of freshwater bodies, are the Upper and Lower Pierce Reservoirs and Seletar Reservoir.

Entry to MacRitchie is free of charge. It is a favourite place for many joggers, many of whom can be seen during Sunday mornings. One of the most common sight of wildlife here, is bands of monkeys roaming around the fringe forest especially near the water edge. These are long-tailed macaques and they are rather tame. Visitors however, should not get too near to these creatures as there is no telling when they might turned violent. One should also not feed them. Constant feeding by visitors, will cause the monkeys to gradually lose their natural capabilities to forage for food in the jungle. The best way is simply to watch them from a distance.

Other wildlife that are common here, are different varieties of tortoises, butterflies and dragonflies. Skinks sunning themselves are also a common sight. Monitor lizards are also easily spotted during noon time. Birds are well represented here. These include the Yellow-vented Bulbul, the Yellow-throated Sunbird, the White-bellied Sea Eagle, the Collared Kingfisher and the White-throated Kingfisher. I also believed that at least a nesting pair of the fascinating Greater Racquet-tailed Drongo, resides here, having seen them on several occasions over a period of time.

At least 2 varieties of pitcher plants can also be found here. Off the beaten track, streams and small pools of water, are homes to different types of tropical freshwater fishes."
,,Good for jogging and nature walks,4.0,,"For starters, don't go on a Monday as the famous treetop walk is closed on Monday. Other than that, MacRitchie Reservoir is a lovely huge place to come for a morning or evening walk or jog with friends and family. We went with friends and took the Petai Trail which had some interesting educational stuff along the way. You could skip the trails and go sit by the quiet reservoir and observe the macaques. They're not dangerous but don't start feeding them either. Did you know that Singapore has some 300 parks? This is one of them!"
,,Tranquil,4.0,,MacRitchie Reservior environment is very peaceful and natural and seems to have a soothing effect on most people.
,,A great place to relax,3.0,,"It is a nice place to relax, especially in the early morning or evening when it is not too hot in sunny Singapore. The active one can either jog, run or take a slow walk in the many trails in the park."
,,Singapore's green lung: pretty but can be busy,4.0,,"Probably Singapore's most popular running trail, with good reason, but a lot more as well.

A large parkland area, with a well-manicured section around the dam to the south, here you will find formal landscape gardens, piers, a pleasant shoreline, an open cafe and a air-conditioned restaurant, as well as free showers for the exercise addicts.

To the other sides of the lake lie walking/running trails, nature trails on wooden boardwalks and the tree canopy walk. It's a full 11k around the lake, so if you decide to walk it all, take plenty of water as there are no intermediate refreshment stops. The nature trails near the dam are an easier option at only 2-3k.

If you're lucky you will encounter some animals: monkeys are common (DO NOT FEED!) but there are also monitor lizards, snakes, birds and turtles to be found."
,,"Good for a quiet walk, picnic, exercise",5.0,,"Quiet, natural reserve in the middle of Singapore. Good for a walk, picnic, or 5km/10km running exercise. Bring your own hydration because the whole trail can be 10km long."
,,Be one with nature,5.0,,Great off the beat place that is unknown to many. Huge reservoir and nice place for a relaxed time with nature.
,,"Water Sports, Hiking And History All In One Place",5.0,,"MacRitchie Reservoir Park & HSBC TreeTop Walk is a relatively large area, comprising mostly of the 9 Nature Trails & Tracks (Chemperai, Prunus, Lornie, Jering, Pertaling, Terentang, Jelutong, Sime, Peirce).

Most of the attractions are located at the main MacRitchie Reservoir Park area, around the Pump Station, Amenities Centre and Bandstand. As the Singapore Canoe / Kayak Federation is located here, this area is popular with canoe / kayak athletes, who train here fairly often.

The start of the Broadwalk / Forest Broadwalk is located just beyond the Kayak / Canoe Launching Pontoon and Fishing Ground, next to a Fitness Corner. This Broadwalk / Forest Broadwalk circles the perimeter of MacRitchie Reservoir Park and the central water catchment area, and is therefore quite long.

The Bandstand is located at the older portion of MacRitchie Reservoir Park. With its unique twisting zig zag bridge, the Bandstand is the most iconic structure in MacRitchie Reservoir Park, and is most closely associated with it by Singaporeans. On the nearby hill stands the Lim Bo Seng Tomb, a memorial to Singapore's World War II spy and hero.

On the opposite end of MacRitchie Reservoir Park is the HSBC TreeTop Walk. A free-standing suspension bridge that connects 2 hills in MacRitchie Reservoir Park, the HSBC TreeTop Walk offers a fantastic view of the forest canopy. The HSBC TreeTop Walk is also used for research purposes. From the HSBC TreeTop Walk, the Jelutong Tower is just a short distance away, and also offers a great view of the rainforest.

The shortest route to HSBC TreeTop Walk is from Venus Drive, or from the Singapore Island Country Club. The longest route is from the main MacRitchie Reservoir Park. A round trip, on foot, via the short route takes around 2.5 hours, while the long route takes around 5 hours.

If you're planning a visit, admission is free, though it's best to visit during daylight hours, and before 4.30pm. Allocate between 1 to 6 hours for viewing, depending on which nature trail you follow. Bring plenty of water, and wear a good pair of shoes. If you bring food, keep it sealed in bags, as the resident wildlife, especially monkeys, may be attracted by it."
,,"Nice walk, peaceful surrounds",4.0,,"Good walking and running track. Scenic and lots of wildlife (birds, monkeys, lizards). Not many facilities for children that we saw (i.e. tiny playground and paths not suitable for scooter)"
,,best 11km in the jungle you can do.,4.0,,"i walk around here as often as I can. it is a 11 km circuit and more if you want to take in the treetop walk.
It is quiet, hit, humid and great to be away from the sounds smells and clutter that is the vertical mall of Singapore.
ercently I saw a 2m water monitor and you will see lots of fish, birds and other animals in ther reserve.
Remember to bring lots of water and an umbrella in case it rains.
See you on the trail..."
,,a great escape and encounter with nature,4.0,,"Visited here a while back, but it's still one of my favorite activities in Singapore. It feels like a wonderful escape from the city center. You will see monkeys on the way into the reservoir area. There will likely be many birds and some reptiles around. The boardwalk is right up against the water's edge, so it's fun and a little exciting."
,,Loved the tree canopy walk,5.0,,GREAT canopy walk and it's free. Beautifully maintained and well-marked trails.
,,"A little oasis, but watch out for the monkeys",4.0,,"MacRitchie is a great place to jog, cycle, scoot, walk. The trails run for kilometres. Watch out for the monkeys though, don't feed them and don't leave bags unattended - they'll nick them looking for food. If they get aggressive, avoid eye contact."
,,Paradise on earth,5.0,,It was an amazing walk through the rain forests. Though I missed tree top walk but I enjoyed other trails. It's a Paradise on earth for joggers and walkers. Careful about the signs for direction otherwise u may miss out the way out.
,,Very nice walk,4.0,,The MacRitchie reservoir has a very nice walk in one of Singapore nature reserve. What is amazing is to find a tropical park which is more manicured than the typical Swiss parks... Nice for a relaxing walk on weekend or for some jogging in the morning.
,,Easy rainforest hikes & a different perspective of Singapore,4.0,,"This is a great place for keeping fit if you live in Singapore & if you are visiting, this is the place to get a different perspective of Singapore: lots of options of walks/runs, plenty of parking and now that the new MRT line is open, it is much more accessible by public transport. The suspension bridge part of the walk is a lot of fun & can be done as a shorter walk. The bridge is one way only and is not open on Mondays (as I learned to my cost). Lots of monkeys (do not feed), birds and monitor lizards in the park."
,,"Great walk, take water",4.0,,"We loved the suspension bridge! the entire walk is about 3 hours and you can see lots of trees, monkeys and the occasional monitor lizard. Take water! Best MRT station is Caldecott. It is closed on Mondays!"
,,You won't believe you're in Singapore,5.0,,"My husband and I decided to do the walk at the reservoir and came away pleasantly surprised. Once inside the resorvoir, you simply will not beleive you are still in SIngapore. Although the full walk is quite long, you can do 1-2 sections just to experience the reservoir. A most calming way to spend a morning."
,,A real retreat,5.0,,"forget the glitz of the usual shopping malls and submerge yourself under the forest canopy, meet monkeys really close, and do the tree walk. I spent a morning walk doing 8km but easy. A memory I will cherish !"
,,Perfect running place,5.0,,"This place is serene and great to take a run at, even if you are only in Singapore for a little while. Doesn't get too hot, since it's next to a huge body of water. A little polluted, but that doesn't affect the practicality of this place. Also, bus stop right outside!"
,,Green haven for all,5.0,,"Whether you'd like to nurse a good book on bench facing the huge expanse of water, or go for a jog on a trail, or just hang out with your kids, this is a great place. I'm very nostalgic about this because I grew up with family visits, picnics and school cross-country runs at the reservoir and today, I'm bringing my own kids on these similar family outings."
,,Revamped! Love the nature trail!,4.0,,If you skip the manicured lawn and gazebo area and head towards the nature trail...you will get up-close to nature. I love the way the wood footpath lets you get close to the waters' edge. And there are few(er) joggers crowding out your personal space.
,,Step Inside MacRitchie Park to Experience a Different World,4.0,,"MacRitchie Reservoir Park features miles of hiking and walking paths. One loop is a long as 11 km. If you leave before 4:30, you can still enjoy the tree top walk and a part of the trail that takes you along a boardwalk in the middle of rainforest. At various times of day, you can see large families of monkeys. Monitor lizards can grow to be over 1 meter long in this area. All sorts of interesting insects and plants. Be sure to take water as it is hot and humid and you can dehydrate quickly. There are some observation towers to climb and nice park areas around the reservoir. You can download hiking maps on line. The area by the busstop on Lornie road has been redone recently, and is a good place to start and end your hike, as there is parking, some food vendors and restrooms."
,,The best run in Singapore,5.0,,"If you like pain that is. It is an 11.5km loop, the positive is that you are covered most of the way around, so the heat isn't too bad. The humidity can be overpowering though and it is a tough and hilly run. The scenery is lovely, you may see monkeys, giant water dragon things and beautiful butterflies. Ammenities are good, showers, lockers, toilets etc"
,,Relax,4.0,,"A serene place to hang out or go for hiking. A very educational place too, All the information of plants are stated along the path way throughout the reservoir. There is guided path till the end of the reservoir."
,,Great walk,4.0,,The walk aroundthe reservoir is a great way to get away from it all. Hard to beleive that you are just minutes from Orchard Rd. I think it is about 11 or 12k if you walk the entire route or you can enter by the side (near the gold course) and just walk to the ranger station and then the tree top walk. You can see monkeys and other wild lief along the way. Make sure you bring water with you!
,,"Nice, peaceful reservoir",4.0,,"We have visited the reservoir right after rain, which made it hotter, more humid and more peaceful than usual (if it was possible). We nearly bumped into no one on the trail.
The track is easy to follow and mainly means real walking with limited up and down hiking, meanwhile high hills are not recommended :)
Small monkeys, butterflies and turtles could be encountered during the way."
,,One of the better Reservoir Parks in the world,3.0,,"not one for parks, thats why the rating, but even then i find the amenities good, and the amenities wide ranging, nice orchid garden and beautiful amphitheatre though they should try pricing items lower."
,,Peaceful Hike,5.0,,"I came for the Tree Top Walk, but what a great park to take a hike! Lots of monkeys to take photos of along the way. Once you get to the entrance of the Tree Top Walk, take your time on the suspension bridge, it's the highlight of the hike! Bring water!

(Tips on getting there by public transit. I took the MRT to Caldecott, then walked to the MacRitchie Park entrance. From the entrance, it was 5K to the beginning of the Tree Top Walk. I left via Venus Drive off Upper Thomson Road. Not sure of the distance, but it was by far a much shorter route! There were several bus stops right off the Venus Drive Entrance.)"
,,Awesome Walks,4.0,,"Awesome walks. There are birds, monkeys,butterflies, good location...It's good."
,,a beautiful and peaceful place,5.0,,"This is just one of many places of nature in Singapore. My husband and I spent 3 hours walking on a boardwalk that encircles the water, as well as waliking on the trails through the forest. We saw turtles, fish, beautiful red dragonflies,many butterflies and a couple of monkeys. One can walk up a tower that is high above the tree canopy....as well as the Tree-Top walk which is a suspension bridge which allows for another bird's eye view of the forest canopy. A lovely way to enjoy nature in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Singapore."
,,No fees for a green Singapore,5.0,,You can say this is smack in the center of the island. Connected by many dirt tracks. Runners and cyclists come here on the weekends. Great place to be to get away from it all.
,,Peaceful,4.0,,It's hard to believe you're still in Singapore when you enter MacRitchie. It's very peaceful.
,,Newly Reformed Oasis,4.0,,"Was terribly infested by mosquitoes. A favourite hunting ground for flashers. Now,it's rather decorated and the quiet paths are adequately lit. Still won't suggest to lone female joggers, but it's definitely a great place to jog or walk with a group of buddies."
,,Very visitors friendly nature park of Singapore,5.0,,"Love strolling in lighter tropical rainforest, but still don't want have the risk of being attack by wild beasts or trolls, this is the perfect place!
Go early in the morning to experience surreal charm, hard to believe this is actually in the city state of Singapore."
,,Be prepared to really walk as it nearly a hike!,3.0,,"It is a nice bit of vegetation close to the city, in January the humidity wasn't to bad but we did walk early. Our intensional was to do half te 12 Klms track and have a taxi red back. To see the jungle tree top walk however means yu have to do the loop, this is not clear in the information we read. Some steep climbs but Diane, there were families and we are in our fifties but the pathway is very rugged and UN e en, we took the road back! Plenty of monkeys to see but none of the lizards promised."
,,Jungle in the City,4.0,,"Took bus 156 from Sengkang all the way to Mt Alvernia hospital, cross the over pass and walk to the rightside all the way up the reservoir. Around the park there are some water activities: Kayak, Fishinh, etc. The best and cheapest activity would be their Treetop Walk trail, estimated 11Km or 1.5 hours walk/jog up the treetop and another 1.5 hrs back to reservoir.
Be carefull of falling trees and monkeys. Best time to go up is early morning, 7-8am to make sure you can return to the base before noon. Highly advisable to bring a bottle of water, since at 3/4 of the trail there is a Ranger Camp, where you can use toilet and refill your water bottle."
,,Nature at its very best,5.0,,"Large relaxing reservoir, brilliant water side and 'forest-deep' walking trails, lush green surrounds, fishing quarters, a friendly cafe to rest those tired limbs and partake delicious sustenance make Macritchie Reservoir a wonderful place to picnic at."
,,a place to jog,3.0,,"It's an average place to go and walk, hike or run. If you want to see some small wild monkeys, this is the place."
,,Treetop walk is exhausting but well worth it,4.0,,"A taxi dropped me off at the Venus Drive entrance and I took the treetop walk by myself on a Sunday. I'm certainly glad that I had my 20 ounce bottle of water with me. There are a few water stations, but it would be best to carry a bottle. The website says the walk will take anywhere from 3-5 hours, depending on your pace. I could have done the walk a bit faster than I did (2.5 hrs), but I kept stopping to allow noisy folks to pass me by. I'm in reasonably good shape, but I would not say great shape by any means, so I think to do it in 5 hours you'd have to be moving at a crawl. I would definitely try to go on a weekday if possible so that you encounter fewer crowds.

As others have mentioned, the section of the walk that is on the suspension bridge way up in the trees only takes about 10 minutes to traverse. The rest of the walk is on rocky trails and a wooden walkway through the forest getting to and from the suspension bridge. If you take a moment to stop and look and listen (assuming no noisy folks are nearby!) you will see and hear plenty while just walking along.

I saw people with small children, but I don't know how they managed. I assume they wound up carrying the kids much of the way.

I wore Teva sandals, which were fine, but I would have preferred to be wearing athletic shoes since the trails are rather rocky and there are some slippery areas as well.

All in all, it was a great experience since we certainly don't see tropical forests in New York! It was good to get out of the city and get some serious exercise while seeing and hearing the tropical wildlife."
,,"Lovely, tranquil retreat in the heart of Singapore",4.0,,The central catchment area is not called that for no reason -- expect lush foliage and lots of water!!
,,The opposite of an Orchard Road experience,5.0,,"The most idyllic experience, walking trails, tree top bridges, water side paths and hanging out with monkeys, iguanas and butterflies. Ohm......"
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,Excellent park. The walking trails are very good. The Tree top walk is a nice experience as well.
,,Nice getaway from the city,4.0,,"Although the park is located very near the city, it is a nice place for a day out, or a quiet picnic. The park is huge, so do not stray into remote areas, especially in the evenings. Female park goers be extra careful."
,,Singapore's hidden gem,5.0,,If you are a runner or walker take a 10 minute taxi ride to Macritchie . Excellent trail runs and walks . Links to Bukit Timah too . Bring water although there is a ranger station with fountains roughly half way round the 10.55km route . Toilets and showers available too and lockers ( 1 Sgd )
,,Walk through rainforest round reservior,4.0,,"Beautiful, safe walk through rainforest surrounding the MacRitchie Reservoir. You will see monkeys. Best to go early, say 7 or 8am as it gets very humid and usually rains later. Very busy at weekends. Very popular with sporty people for running etc. I would prefer fewer people, but, hey, its a small island with 5million people!"
,,Not very interesting,3.0,,"This park is not as interesting as the Sungei Buloh. It’s just a forest built by human with simple animals like monkeys. Yes, they snatched my hat. There’s not much to see around here unless you want to walk in a peaceful forest with birds singing and the unspoiled air. When taking the tree top walk it’s just like the forest in Star Wars movie."
,,Real jungle in the middle of Singapore,4.0,,"The reservoir has a 15km walk-pat and although but tough for some people, this is a good place to walk and get yourself into the real jungle. Monkeys (which you can't feed!) are almost everywhere, and there are many other fauna around. While in the jungle, observe the safety regulations though!"
,,Pleasant area for walking- from easy walks to more challenging!,5.0,,"The Reservoir is a catchment for drinking water in Singapore.

It's also used for recreational and competitive rowing, and provides a backdrop for a natural vegetation reserve.

You can walk through the reserve, with a variety of walking trails of varying lengths and difficulties. There's good signage highlighting points of interest.

If you're feeling energetic, you can access the Tree Top Walk from here- it's about 4.5 km walking.

The Tree Top Walk involves walking along a suspended footbridge, 25 metres above the forest canopy.

The area is peaceful, and pleasant for walking or simply sitting under a tree and reading a book!

It provides a contrast to busy commercial Singapore!"
,,incredible rainforest in city state,5.0,,"Firstly, MacRitchie is not the only point of entry for what is known as the vast Central Catchment Area in Singapore, but it is the most recognisable landmark, especially if you're taking public transport. Other points of entry are Bukit Timah Nature Reserve which is separately listed here as a tourist attraction, as well as Pierce Reservoir. Lesser known entry points include Jalan Kampung Chantek, Rifle Range Road and Chestnut Drive. If you go from these points, you will likely have the trail entirely to yourself. As others have pointed out, Bt Timah is getting crowded and MacR is also well-used, even during week days.

At the quiet sectors you are more likely to come across (harmless, non-venomous) snakes lying across the path, monkeys that aren't aggressive because they haven't been fed by the hordes of visitors, skinks basking in the sun, brilliant birds with lilting calls, ranges of tree fungus and plenty of other wildlife and fauna.

You can take a one-hour brisk walk, 3-hr long trek or stop to stare at every fascinating part of nature, depending on your fancy and time available. The trails are not suitable for kids under 6 as the path can be rocky or criss-crossed by roots. You need to be intrepid enough.

The v young (in strollers) or old or wheel-chaired will find the board walk from MacRitchie easy going and you get to be right up to the waters' edge as well as in the jungle.

It may be useful to bring an umbrella, not only to shade from the sun (the few stretches with jungle canopy) or tropical showers but also as a useful distraction/ weapon against the monkeys that may approach. Make sure you have no food with you, even in a bag, as they can smell it and may attack you for it. This is esp if you have toddlers with snacks."
,,A Singapore Surprise,4.0,,"Ready accessible by bus from downtown, this slice of nature/wilderness is a great place to escape the high-rise uniformity of commercial Singapore. Wear a sturdy pair of walking shoes and carry some water - and set out on one of the several trails through the jungle. See monkeys and monitor lizards galore, and head for the Tree Top Walk - a 250 metre suspension bridge over the rainforest. The shortest route to the Tree Top Walk is 4 kilometres, so this is an outing for those willing to make a bit of an effort. The trail accommodates joggers as well as walkers - but they seem to coexist reasonably well (weekends can be busy). The trails are not difficult, except they have used large aggregate and building rubble (bricks etc) in places to stabilise the surface, and this can make the going rough (hence the need for good shoes). The signage could be better in places. Where the paths approach the Tree Top Walk, for instance, the lack of decent signs makes it quite confusing; however, there should be people around to ask directions. A nice half-day excursion."
,,Real Jungle within 20 minutes of Orchard Road,4.0,,"My teenage son and I were recently in Singapore (December), and after the typical tourist attractions, we decided to explore one of Singapore's nature preserves. The draw was the ""tree top"" walk consisting of a tree top suspension bridge at the end of a 5km hike through the hot steamy jungle (in a good sort of way). We took the bus from our hotel on Orchard road and was at the McRitchie Reservoir stop in less than 20 minutes. (Side tip - use Google maps of Singapore, and choose directions by ""public transit"" to easily get the route and bus number you'll need.)

Since we knew what to expect, wore the appropriate clothing and shoes, and brought water, it was quite a unique and enjoyable experience. The main trail to the treetop walk starts at the reservoir, winds around the reservoir, and ends up 5km later at a rangers station (with welcomed restrooms and water fountains). Note that they do close the tree top walk bridge at 5:00pm to allow people enough time to hike back before dark (and closed on Mondays). We saw some wild monkeys with babies, jungle looking birds, and lots of interesting trees and plants.

On the return hike, we took a side path that brought us onto a water side boardwalk. This was very well done. The boardwalk was very well maintained, and various well placed signs explained some of the features of the jungle ecosystem.

I would classify the hike as easy if you're not in a hurry (only one long uphill at the very end).

If you're looking for something beyond the typical shopping and eating vacation in Singapore, give the McRitchie Nature Preserve a try. There are actually quite a few Nature Preserves, but we didn't have the opportunity to see the other ones.

If you're just interested in the treetop walk, there's actually a much easier one in town at Kent Ridge park. That one actually has a very interesting elevated catwalk - also worth exploring.

One last note, at the bus stop just before reaching the one at the reservoir, there's a string of about half a dozen plant and nursery shops (on the left heading north). If you have any interest in plants at all, make sure to stop and take a look. Amazing display of orchid and pitcher plants, and one shop had the most amazing cut flower inventory (orchids and other tropicals). Too bad we couldn't bring anything home!"
