,,Singapore history,4.0,,"It has been more than 10 years since I last visited the National Museum and was amazed with its new look. Of interest were the four gallaries spanning the past 100 years: Modern Colony, Surviving Syonan, Growing up and Voices of Singapore where snapshorts of everyday life throughout the different eras of Singapore history were displayed.
The other interesting areas were: Singapore History Gallery; Singapore, very old tree; Goh Seng Choo Gallery: Magic & Menance; Story of the Forest."
,,Imrpessive for whole family,5.0,,Yesterday I visited national museum with family - each of us discovered interesting and pleasantly presented information & history.
,,History,5.0,,So interesting to visit the History exhibit with a guided tour. Allow an hour at least to cover all the photographs and read about the sequence of events to fully understand it all.
,,Essential to understand the history of Singapore,5.0,,"This grand, neo-colonial building is wonderfully set up to deliver an clever summary of the history of Singapore covering the key stages in its development. It mixed the history of politics, culture, society and of course colonisation and war in a very deft and intelligent manner. You could easily spend a day here. S good cafe available."
,,Educational,4.0,,"You'll spend at least 3 hours here if you take in the exhibits in the museum, especially the video presentations that littered throughout the museum that range from documentaries to personal interviews. Very educational place to visit."
,,More geared toward the neophyte,4.0,,"Clearly, the National Museum of Singapore aims to educate the young of the island in the varied history of the republic. There is less here for a more advanced connoisseur of history."
,,A very good introduction to Singapore history,5.0,,Friendly staff and so much history to learn. The display and layout provides a very good introduction to Singapore history. The cafe is also very good for when you want to take a break.
,,Informative and comfortable,5.0,,"Popped in here on a whim, actually turned out to be a very well-constructed museum with good information on the history of Singapore"
,,Repository of History,4.0,,Best place to explore the history & culture of Singapore. Visualize the architecture. Building looks like a fusion of old & new
,,Discover Singapore's history,5.0,,"The building is interesting as is the permanent exhibition about Singapore's history. From the very beginnings to the actual times, a good way to understand the City's diversity and foundation."
,,historical,5.0,,"a very nice place to see all the oldest things in Singapore, the staffs are very helpful tol guide u inside the place"
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"There were a few things that really attracted me. The video interviews with Lee Quan Yew were incredible, as were the small items found from the very early populations that used to live here. The Japanese occupation story was well told but I did feel that some of the atrocities were a bit glossed over. A beautiful building with very helpful staff."
,,Singapore Histoy,5.0,,I think this is a must visit if you care about history or world events. It describes the founding of Singapore and how the city was planned out. I was especially interested in the building of the museum as well. They have books provided to where you can read about these things.
,,Great place to gain an understanding of Singapore and its people,5.0,,"In the renovated/ restored National Library meeting, the extension is harmonious with the old (Burra charter). The exhibition about its past well curated"
,,Singapore History With Dessert,4.0,,"Museum has a very impressive display outlining Singapore's history, focusing largely upon political movements prior to the Japanese invasion, and the invasion itself, which cannot help but raise questions about how the British failed to protect one of its own colonies. Much of what Lee Kuan Yew, who became Singapore's Prime Minister following the Japanese surrender, said did echoes very much Singapore's post incursion and determination to create a nation of independence. What is displayed in this museum provides very clear evidence of this history.
An absolutely delightful added attraction in the museum is a gallery (open only at certain times), which features an emphasis on forest conservation. The display also includes an unquestionably beautiful sensory experience within the ""Glass Rotunda""."
,,Come here pleaseee,5.0,,"Honestly I am not that interested in museum but this one was just a different level, just by the appearance was already something."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Good range of material on a historical timeline from founding of a settlement to modern times. Plenty to see from a range of perspectives.
,,Very interesting,5.0,,Based in a stunning Colonial Building built by the British. Numerous levels with different exhibits and zones. We visited the History of Singapore zone which we found to be very interesting and informative. You would need several hours to view all of it.
,,The Building is a Gem!,4.0,,"We approached the museum from the rear - from Fort Canning Park - and the modern annex is huge and airy. The first display was a sinuous curve of very detailed text about the trades unions and their part in independence - I tried, but it was far too much to read. We walked over the Glass Passage connecting the two parts of the museum.

The free exhibits included large rooms on the history of Singapore, including one devoted to the Japanese occupation. It is interesting reading some of the comments here by Japanese tourists. They generally do not know much about it at all. NMS has a mandate to explain the recent history of the country and it does that well.

Some of the exhibits on other aspects are underwhelming. We did not, on that basis, pay for tickets to the other parts of the museum. However, the original Victorian building is a gem! We were only in Singapore for a few days, but it was worth seeing the dome from the inside first and then seeing the fa√ßade from the road last. Truly a treasure worth maintaining but it struggles to compete on the world stage of national museums."
,,Always Excellent,5.0,,"This was our hird visit over the years and the Museum just keeps getting better - this time we took two of our granddaughters on their first overseas trip - they were blown away by the exhibits and, in particular, the Story of the Forest and Surviving Syonan exhibitions as well as the amazing tecnological display in the Glass Rotunda."
,,"Free guided tour, very interesting.",5.0,,Insightful display if Singapore history and past. All in conditioned comfort. Can spend a full day inside. May return.
,,not my favorite place,2.0,,"I always enjoy visiting museums but this one was not what I was looking for. Well, thinking of the history of Singapore, probably this museum has interesting items. But most of them were pretty modern collections. You may be able to find similar items in your garage. This place may be interesting for people who want to learn about Singapore, but not exciting for people who want to enjoy art or old things."
,,Know more about Singapore's roots,5.0,,"If it's your first time in Singapore, I would recommend for you to stop by the National Museum first. By joining the guided tour, you would learn so much about Singapore's roots. We purchased our tickets via Klook. Check the museum's website to know the visiting hours."
,,Free guided tour was excellent!,4.0,,We did a free guided tour of the museum with a volunteer guide. Our guide was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions. She took us on a tour of Singapore's history and culture and it was really interesting to see Singapore's development. We did this tour on our first day in Singapore and it opened our eyes for the rest of the trip!
,,perfect choice for the day,5.0,,"take the docent tour at 11am and 2pm. in an hour, we can get to know more about the SG history. And it is a perfect choice to avoid the rain or sun in the middle of day"
,,Interesting,3.0,,"The national museum is very close the Battlebox and I would recommend to combine the two together. The part that I found interesting is the historical one. One get a good understanding of Singapore's history, economical background and culture. The rest of the museum was not anything special."
,,Amazing Collection and Terrific Rotating exhibi!,5.0,,"The NAtional Museum of Singapore is outstanding. Located in part of the old Parliment building, this museum has been retrofitted and expanded into a breathtaking space filled with exceptional Asian art. We thoroughly enjoyed the gorgeous modern art collection as well as the ""Awakenings"" exhibit. You can also visit the old Parliment to learn more about the vibrant history of Singapore."
,,Great museum !,5.0,,"This museum will bring some great historic context to your visit in Singapore. Some exhibits may be skipped, but do not miss the British colonial period as well as the Japanese occupation during WWII !
Note that the layout of the place is not clear, we had to ask our way a couple of time during our visit."
,,Amazing. You'll stay at least 3 hours easy.,5.0,,"You'll spend 3-5 hours here if you take in the exhibits in the museum, especially the video presentations littered throughout the museum that range from documentaries to personal interviews that helps unravel the mystery and emphasizes the allure of Singapore from centuries old up to the present.

A must-go for tourists before leaving Singapore."
,,Worth to visit,4.0,,"We stayed at YMCA@One Orchard which is right next to the museum. With our Singpaore tourist pass, we had SG$2 discount. There were many exhibits and interesting history on Singapore."
,,What an amazing Tour!!!,5.0,,"Visiting the National gallery was fantastic! There was a free guided English tour that my partner and I joined. The hosts name was Chai - this man was passionate about the history of his country and was proud to share his love. Chai made all tour members comfortable and tried to link each visitors home country to the impact it has had on Singapore!
I can‚Äôt recommend this attraction enough!"
,,Very interesting and great place to visit,5.0,,"We went here for the afternoon and was amazed at the amount of information we read. The museum had a couple of interactive videos happening when we were there which were interesting but it was the Singapore info that was of more interest to us.

We ate in the cafe inside the museum and was was impressed with the choice available.

Highly recommended."
,,Totally recommended,5.0,,"In our second day in Singapore, it rained and rained and rained, so we decided to make it a museum day.
In this museum we learned so much about Singapore history. There are different installations, all of them so very well made, interactive, and the use of technology is incredibly.
Totally worth it to learn a bit of the country."
,,Interesting,4.0,,Lovely Colonial building with a great art display inside. Will take a fair time to go around the whole building. Fantastic water garden on top of building with a bar and great view
,,Museum,5.0,,"Wonderful place to visit, very interesting way to learn about the history of Singapore in air conditioned comfort."
,,Historic Context for Your Visit to Singapore,4.0,,"Do not let the traditional look of the museum's exterior fool you, the exhibits and the presentation media within make it as contemporary and impressive as the city state that surrounds it. A literal walk through the history of Singapore with a great layout of galleries, interesting artifacts and many multi-media presentations."
,,Outstaning,5.0,,"Ok this place is great. A must do Adults $15.00 and Seniors $10.00. We had a guide at no cost she was great. Can get a bit crowded,but well worth it. Heaps of exhibits very informative. Give it a go."
,,Wonderfully designed building and historical features.,5.0,,"The building itself is a beautiful amalgam of old and new - beautifully done. We arrived just in time for a free guided tour, and we couldn't have been more pleased with the quality of the displays and the knowledge of the guide. Do go to this museum!"
,,Excellent Museum and Cafe,5.0,,"Well worth a visit to help put Singapore into context and understand where it has come from. We attended just as a tour was commencing which we were recommended to join (for free) so we did. The tour was led by a volunteer who was extremely well informed and good. The museum is beautifully laid out and presented - some really interesting exhibits and just enough information. The exhibitions are all good - on the first floor the exhibition dealing with the history of Singapore is probably the main one and definitely worth visiting, taking you from the 12c ? through the main different cultures that make up Singapore, through the 2WW with some very interesting artefacts if not gruesome reminders and then on to independence and the subsequent growth of Singapore into where it is today. Would also recommend the cafe in the museum - good value and very good quality food if a little laid back in service it's worth the wait."
,,Excellent presentation of the history of Singapore,5.0,,"The layout takes you through a well presented history, with little rooms and spaces laid out to show the different periods and the different social and racial mix and their customs, lifestyles and working conditions - e.g. opium dens and the growth of the city and the WW11 period."
,,Excellent interactive Musuem,4.0,,"Though this might not be the first time we have gone to the musuem, my kids still love it coz they always have new themes and exhibits. The current theme is very suitable for kids (just curious).

My girls aged 8 and 10 loved all the 4 themes. They had fun with the gigantic puzzles, weighing the anchor, fixing back the vases and of course the bouncy castle and interactive in the Stories of Forest. I forgot to mentioned they loved drawing and colouring their toy and get to play some of the traditional games.

I have also bought the interactive guidebook which they enjoyed working on it and reading it whenever they saw the artefact in the permanent gallery. We have not finished with the entire book in the musuem and do intent to visit the musuem once again to finish up the remaining activies.

Overall, recommended for all to go."
,,Interesting exhibit on history of Singapore,4.0,,"Wonderful, updated building. Great display on the history of Singapore. Great way to learn about local history for a first time visitor. There was also an interesting exhibit on packaging. Near the university."
,,A Great Learning Place,5.0,,We spent 4 hours here. It was a great place to learn about the history of Singapore. Sir Thomas Raffles established Singapore as a trading hub for the eastern world . The occupation of the Japanese just a couple of great information.
,,So much to see,5.0,,"I arrived just as a guided highlights tour was starting and I joined that. For the next 75 mins, a pleasant Aussie docent led us around the main gallery and gave us a whirlwind history of Singapore of pre-Raffles, through the inter-Raffles colonial years and onward to the World War 2 bit of which I was now well acquainted.

After the war was also covered nicely if briefly showing the 2 year dalliance with, and subsequent divorce of, Malaysian unification, gaining its own national identity and the whole HDB slash green area initiatives by first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew that has made Singapore the green concrete jungle (in both senses of that word) that it is today. It was kind of a neat way of tying up my whole experience of Singapore.

After the tour, I wandered around by myself to catch up on some of the reading and watching, but would highly recommend the tour - maybe try to get a quieter tour, ours was so large we couldn't get into some of the rooms."
,,Great Introduction to Singapore's History,4.0,,"If you want a good overview of Singapore's history, this is the place to visit. Very informative displays, highly effective use of media and diverse materials all help the visitor to gain a good understanding of this island's past."
,,What you'd expect...,5.0,,"...from a National Museum. Actually it kind of started out on a bit of a (I'm really struggling for a word here) unexpected note. After purchasing my ticket, I was directed to an escalator that took me to the the top of the building's rotonda where you wind your way back down viewing a digital display of a forest (which I guess is Singapore back in the day). It was certainly colorful, visually pleasing, and the kids running back and forth seemed to love it. I guess for me, when I go to a museum (especially a national one), I'm expecting to see realia as opposed to basically digital animation. Then again, it's a nice wow factor for the kids. That didn't last long as you find yourself on the bottom floor in the main historical gallery of the museum covering the breadth of Singapore's history. Here is where I found the great displays and information panels I wanted. Too much to go into about what is displayed, but my visit to the museum today left me a question in my mind. A big part of the main historical gallery covers both the British colonial period as well as the Japanese occupation during WWII. There is even a separate display about the Japanese occupation; I believe it was on the second floor of the museum. What I found interesting was that these displays on the Japanese occupation really bring to life the horror that occurred during this period. Yet for the most part, the British colonial is sort of viewed through rose-colored glasses. Yes there are disturbing displays about things such as how the colonial British ""encouraged"" opium addiction, but I would think colonial occupation to be just as horrific, maybe even more debilitating, and certainly more insidious then a much shorter period of wartime occupation. I am certainly not trying to minimize the responsibility of the Japanese for their war crimes, it's just that I left the museum wondering why the scope of the British colonial period is not viewed in a similar manner."
,,Interesting knowledge,5.0,,In this museum one learns a lot about southeastasian countries history and art. A must for art lovers.
,,Some splendid exhibits exploring the social history of Singapore,4.0,,"Housed in a series of buildings that skillfully blend the historic with contemporary museum design, the SNM has some exhibits worth seeing by anyone wanting to understand how the dynamic city of Singapore rose rapidly from sets of rural villages. These exhibits are a well-curated set of objects and subtle digital effects.
The food an beverage offerings are quite good and the staff throughout the museum were unfailingly welcoming and helpful."
,,Updated history of Singapore,4.0,,"As Singaporeans, we get free admission so it's a good idea to come every now and again to view the temporary exhibitions and see how the permant galleries are updated. Was very pleased to find that the history of Singapore had additional and interesting information on the surrender of Singapore, the Japanese Occupation and the separation of Singapore from Malaysia. Even more gratified to find the presentation of facts objective and non-controversial, very fair to all parties and countries involved, but details certainly giving rise to individual responses eg presentation of the Tiger of Malaya, General Yamashita, his trial and execution, the Sook Ching Massacre, Lee Kuan Yew's arguments for merger with Malaysia. There was a very good docent guiding at 11am and while not part of the group, overheard her insightful and humorous commentary which was much appreciated by the visitors.
Found the temporary exhibition on 'Packaging' nostalgic, and the items, eg F n N bottles, posters well-sourced and preserved. Also enjoyed again the Enchanted Forest with the digitalized walk imaginatively put together with lovable small creatures, colorful flora and even tropical rain and melodic sounds.
However, it's rather confusing finding your way around and the restrooms' signage is incredibly difficult to identify especially as the one near the entrance has been usurped by ' Food for Thought' , this food outlet looking rather uninviting with over-priced Western fare. Better to walk a bit to Food Republic across the road for delicious local fare."
,,The history of Singapore,4.0,,"Very beautiful building, very kind and helpful staff, all exhibitions help you ,clearly, to understand Singapore story. I spent 2.5 hours and really I enjoyed. The only .... poor was the museum shop,small and without any attractive think ,except ofcourse some nice books."
,,Interesting and informative,5.0,,We spent about 3 hours (and could easily have spent more if time allowed!) browsing through the many and varied exhibits showcasing the history and culture of Singapore. The displays were interesting and informative. The building itself is impressive.
,,Wonderful. Do not miss it,5.0,,This unique museum houses a wonderful collection of the historical and cultural treasures of Singapore. It is housed in the re-purposed city hall/Supreme Court. I appreciated that rooms do not overcrowd with exhibits so you can enjoy each item. You can view it in a few hours or take longer. I will also at remember this thoughtful curated musuem. Do not miss it.
,,The layout is a little confusing,3.0,,Although I looked at the brochure/map I still found it a little confusing to follow the best way to see this museum. We seemed to start at the most recent time and work our way back and I would have thought it would be better the other way around but didn't figure it out. We got a Seniors discount on entry so it cost us $10 each. It is located in a beautiful building. Give it a go if you have spare time.
,,Tour helped,3.0,,"The best part was the architecture of the old building. Magnificent facade great dome. Behind that is a new extension.
Inside someone greets you and profiles you.
Overseas, under or over 60 or local.
Locals free others pay.
There are 2 main levels. Nothing in basement when i went.
The exhibits highlight the history of Singapore.
Going through on my own i felt the exhibits were a bit weak. The tour for me helped a lot.
Can spends a few hours at most there."
,,Old-fashioned museum,2.0,,"I went to see Lucy Liu's art, which was stuck here because the art museum was closed for renovation. The rest of the place is an old colonial-style museum (so is the art museum)that is all about the history of Singapore. It's pretty mundane. At least the AC was working."
,,A must-do attraction,5.0,,Singapore is incredibly rich in history - from notorious pirates to defeat in WWII to it's incredible transformation. The museum covers it all with interesting interactive exhibits. It helps you find your grounding and understand how it became the economic powerhouse it is today.
,,Uncomfortable Experience,1.0,,I have just been herded out of this place 20 minutes prior to closing. 4 staff following me until I left. Incredibly uncomfortable for a solo female visitor. Don‚Äôt come here alone and definitely don‚Äôt try to stay until the end. Shame on you!
,,Nice & informative,4.0,,"Ticket is 15$ or 10$ if your ‚Äòre student.
Architecture and interior design of the musuem is amazing. They split it into different halls to represent different eras of singapore. They screen a couple pf short documentatries starring real singaporeans.
It is nicely done and informative.
You can also catch the free guided tours if you go on time"
,,A good place to visit,5.0,,An interesting place for people who want to know and understand about the history and the culture of Singapore.
,,GOOD MUSEUM,5.0,,"God museum ,Spectacular exhibition ,Showing the history of Singapore Including the future , Easy access , Use technology to present interesting exhibitions"
,,lovely museum with great exhibits,5.0,,a lovely spacious museum with great exhibits and great space and a very good shop! you can spend hours wandering around it... air conditioned and very well located.
,,Wonderful information on history of Singapore,5.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore is fairly small by museum standards, but it is full of information. There is an amazing exhibit going through the history of Singapore from day ‚Äúone‚Äù to current times. There is so much more to their history than I ever could have imagined. I spent 90 minutes walking through this exhibit and didn‚Äôt touch on a lot of it. There was also a neat exhibit regarding conservation, which I didn‚Äôt take any photos of but did take a number of videos. Singapore is definitely onboard with saving the planet! This exhibit used film and animation to produce it‚Äôs intended effect and it did not disappoint. I would highly recommend a visit here if you are interested in the history of Singapore! And skip the people at the beginning trying to sell you a tour, I don‚Äôt think it is necessary given the size of the museum, though I guess they could have some insights having lived there."
,,Educational and enriching about Singapore History,4.0,,Great learning journey to understand about Singapore history and culture. Exhibits are comprehensive and informative with interactive elements. Walk down the enchanting forest experience to enter the museum. Many artefacts to view.
,,Great place for a visit,5.0,,"We spent a very enjoyable morning wandering through the museum.
It has a good range of exhibits with a mix of the modern (interactive video) style and the old.
The exhibits were all interesting & well set out - with the Forrest experience the highlight.
I always visit museums on my holidays and this one was well worth the visit- highly recommend it!"
,,Very nice museum,4.0,,"I thought it was a really good hour spent there. For the first 20 mins I was fascinated but then it just got too much for me.
Looking at the history of Singapore the stuff they have from the war even a tank which I found fascinating. Some of the drawings as well were really good.
I think for kids it will be a bit too much and boring. It‚Äôs more for adults.
For adults there is a charge as well of 15SGD if you are a non resident."
,,"National Museum of Singapore - Magic and Menace Gallery, Glass Rotunda exhibition, and 700 Years of Singapore History",5.0,,"With a history dating back to its inception in 1887, the National Museum of Singapore is the nation‚Äôs oldest and biggest museum. The famous big rotunda with a stunning dome is just a part of the great architecture that makes the building so special. Located on the bustling Orchard Road, this museum is right at the center of Singapore. NMS is designed like a British colonial building, as it was built for Queen Victoria‚Äôs Golden Jubilee.

I visited 2 tours with an FOM docent during my time at the National Museum. The first one was a gallery called Magic and Menace. This gallery contained watercolor paintings that were commissioned by Singapore‚Äôs first British Resident, William Farquhar. He was so amazed at the tropical landscape, that he commissioned Chinese artists to draw/paint the flora and fauna of the Malay archipelago. There are also tribal tools, products, and artifacts, even dead animals, from Farquhar‚Äôs collection. The reason the gallery is named ‚ÄúMagic and Menace‚Äù, is because of the supernatural beliefs of the locals at that time. They believed in spirits, especially in animals and plants. So, depending on whether there were good or evil spirits, they could create magic or be a menace! Another interesting feature of this gallery were the ‚Äúsmell jars‚Äù in which you could smell Jasmine, Durian, Nutmeg, and the Yellow Champaka flower. This made the tour a multi-sensory discovery experience of the religions, customs, and cultures of the local Malays in the 1800s.

We continued on into another mesmerizing experience titled ‚ÄúStory of the Forest‚Äù. Sixty-nine of Farquhar‚Äôs paintings have been converted into a large, 3D digital panorama, creating a view of the Jungles of Melaka. The lifelikeness of the displays is complete with animation, music, and sound, and invites you to interact with the wildlife of the Malay peninsula in the 19th century up close.

The second tour on ‚ÄúThe 700 Year History Of Singapore‚Äù was about the journey of Singapore to get where it is today. As our docent said, ‚ÄúMost Singaporeans think their history is 200 years old, but in actuality, they will be surprised as to how long the formation of Singapore has taken‚Äù.

This tour takes us through four distinct periods in Singapore‚Äôs life: Singapura (1299 ‚Äì 1818), Crown Colony (1819 ‚Äì 1941), Syonan-To (1942 ‚Äì 1945), and Singapore (1945 ‚Äì present). From being a sleepy fishing town to a British colony to part of the Japanese Pacific expansion, to finally getting freedom, the tour highlights the culture, trade, political situation at each stage. It tells you what it means to be a Singaporean, and Singapore‚Äôs national identity. Complete with life-sized models, this tour is completely immersive and takes you right to the nation‚Äôs defining moments in history. We were told that ‚Äúnothing in Singapore‚Äôs history happened by chance; every move was thought out and well planned. That is how Singapore came to where it is today.‚Äù

The NMS is a museum central to Singapore and is custodian of the 11 National Treasures. It is supported by a wide range of facilities and services including F&B, retail, and a Resource Centre. A cultural and architectural landmark in Singapore, the Museum hosts festivals and events all year round‚Äîthe Night Festival, performances and film screenings, and more‚Äîin addition to presenting interesting exhibitions involving important collections of artifacts. This museum is one you shouldn‚Äôt miss!

Some interesting quotes by the tour guides:

‚ÄúNothing in Singapore‚Äôs history happened by chance, and every move was thought out and well planned. That is how Singapore came to where it is today.‚Äù

‚ÄúThrough the eye of William Farquhar, we are able to see the beauty of Melaka and the Malay Peninsula, geographically, and biologically.‚Äù"
,,Half a day history,3.0,,"Mostly for older kids and adults. History, artefacts, photos. Old building and new modern wing. Playground on top floor for small kids. ‚òïÔ∏è and snack available. Very well accessible with metro üöá."
,,Great museum to visit,4.0,,"I allowed a couple of hours to check the national musuem. Everything, as you would expect in Singapore, is well organised and presented. Many great exhibits but I found myself in the history of Singapore - including the battlebox and wartime section - to be fascinating - and a good pre cursor to the battlebox down the road in Fort Canning.

A little disappointing that there is a nominal charge to get in."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Me and my husband had our first trip to Singapore and came across the museum while exploring on our first morning.
We decided to have a quick look and came out 5 hours later!
It is a wonderful museum with well planned exhibits. I would particularly recommend the Singapore history gallery and the circle of life in the rotunda.
The packaging exhibit is also very good.
You do have to pay for access to all exhibits but there are some which are free and the cost for full access is very reasonable.
Highly recommend a visit but allow plenty of time as there is a lot to see."
,,Good but tourists have to pay!,4.0,,"Wasn't expecting to have to pay to enter the National Museum as most big museums in the UK are free to enter but with a voluntary donation so we were unsure about whether to continue with our visit.

The exhibits are definitely worth spending half a day at if you're interested in the history of Singapore right from the early settlers, through the war to modern Singapore. There's a good range of interactive exhibits and different things to see.

The main exhibition downstairs is a little confusing to navigate at first, I was unsure which order I was meant to go round the exhibit in but once you're through to the WW2 section it's much better layed out.

It's fantastically cool inside, enough so that I actually ended up being cold! Perhaps take an additional layer. Didn't eat at the museum as there's a food court just down by Bras Basah MRT."
,,Good break from hot weather,4.0,,Museum is relatively inexpensive ad for Singapore standard (free for PR and Citizen). Some exhibitons are very interesting (e.g. Magic in South East Asia) while some are just lame (doom with forest).
,,Take the 11am English speaking guided tour!,5.0,,"A very interesting look into the history of Singapore. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and had good insight to Singapores history. Learn about housing and its history, the opium/drug crisis, the early labor struggles and the Chinese, Sir Raffles and his efforts in Singapores history and Lee Kwan Yew the first and beloved Prime Minister. There is a restaurant in the museum. The Museum is located near the Singapore Management University campus/Stamford Rd. The museum opens at 10am and is free to PR, Singaporeans and children under the age of 6."
,,A must visit,4.0,,"This museum is stunningly beautiful building and an excellent and easy way to learn about the fascinating history of Singapore. We`ve been here before and usually have lunch in the cafe, but it was disappointing on this occasion. Not up to their usual high standard."
,,Excellent museum!,5.0,,We had an excellent guide and learned so much about Singapore. So glad we visited. Had outstanding lunch at Flutes.
,,The History of Singapore,5.0,,"If your a history buff this is a must see. Get to view the last 100 years of Singapore. Lots of art work, sculptures and information about when the Japanese captured the area. There's even a tank!"
,,"Interesting history museum, worth the visit",4.0,,"I had not been to this museum in many years, but on a recent trip made a visit and very glad I did. The building is a very nice Colonial style building, and the museum tells the interesting history of Singapore as a trading post to the financial center it is today.
The exhibits are very visually appealing, and everything flows together nicely.
Everyone, but particularly first time visitors to Singapore, should go and learn about Singapores interesting history, from colonialization, to independence to modern day city/ state."
,,Well curated museum,5.0,,"We're locals, been here numerous times, and still lovin' it and recommending to our friends who are visiting... simply because it's a good museum.

Well curated and tells the Singapore and regional history very well, with many artifacts, interactive zones and well-integrated multi-media exhibits to tell the stories better. It's like walking through stories, basically their numerous historical/regional zones, with a very smooth flow, with an extremely immersive experience. The Rotunda is a simple yet fun place for kids and adults alike to experience Singapore's fauna and flora. They also have seasonal exhibitions which truly livens up the whole place with the interactive pieces (e.g. many old games brought back to life as interactive exhibits!), and also brings some truly rare exhibits to Singapore (e.g. wedding traditions and gowns throughout the world and ages).

Never get bored of this place. Good to check out their website for what exciting new exhibitions are coming to down before planning your trip!"
,,Best 6 hours of my life!,5.0,,"Such an amazing experience. I was so lucky as the Sunday that I was there....they offered free entry to their special exhibit (usually an additional cost above the museum entry fee). Definitely take the free tour as it is soooo amusing, educational and entertaining. I didn't expect to spend so much time there but we had to rush through the last section to avoid being locked in.

One sad thing is that the flow of the museum is not clear so the timelines might jump a bit if you walk through the wrong section first."
,,Incredible Mix of Exhibitions and Technology,5.0,,"Constantly refreshed with compelling new exhibitions, the National Museum is a must for family visitors. Singapore's history is on display, its uniqueness and trading hub story sensitively and graphically well told"
,,Time well spent.,4.0,,"Close to the other main museum this one covers the creation and growth of Singapore in an interesting way and has the "" must see ""Raffles Statue close by. Reachable on foot and by tourist boats."
,,A good day out.,5.0,,"The first and greatest delight of the visit is the magnificent architecture of the museum and the now attached old law courts. The cost to visit was reasonable $20sg. Lower for students or those over 60.

The whole set up is marvellous with exhibitions that change over time. There was a minimalist exhibition on when I was there and each to there own it was just that. The exhibition by the artist, Lim was magnificent, showing those with talent don‚Äôt need to be minimalist. Other works of art included beautiful sculptures and paintings outlining the history of Singapore and events that shaped this nation.

The law courts now connected by sky bridges are quite fascinating, you see the many areas, objects and manuscripts that guided and controlled Singapore.

Go for it all but especially go for the architecture."
,,A great visit,4.0,,"Educational, well done and worth the minimum $. Youngsters will enjoy the displays as much as us old folk. Cool and inviting with great displays and organization. The building is classic Victorian. Modernized, clean, cool and inviting. Well worth a visit perhaps after the Battle Box. Can be busy, so get there mid morning at the latest.. Expect to spend 2-3 hours."
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"We visit the museum each time we come to Singapore. The displays are always very interesting. This time we viewed the colony from 1925-1935, to see how life was then. A number of exhibitions going on all the time. Early Singapore, the war years, the evolution to what Singapore is today. A nice cafe and also a fine dining room in the building."
,,Great way to spend a half day,5.0,,"Thoughtful exhibits, create and interesting. Even the baby enjoyed some of the installations. Cafe lovely and even got a free ice cream with the Polaroid exhibit."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"A really well set out, displayed and interactive museum. Not at all stuffy and dry. Thought provoking and informative, within a beautiful building."
,,National Museum,5.0,,"This was a very moving experience for me as it explains vividly the lives of the local people following the invasion by the Japanese in 1942., including how many people died from starvation"
,,General history,3.0,,Museum was surprisingly simple with its presentation of Singapore history - thus a broad outline of their past.
,,Another great museum to visit.,4.0,,"This is a fantastic museum, great displays taking you on a journey from past to present. Interesting to learn about how life returns post war. We were able to get discounted tickets through Klook, but the prices at the museum are very reasonable. Bonus of free wi-fi as well to upload those many pictures. This museum blends the old with very modern displays as well. A great half day outing. The hilight for us was the glass rotunda exhibit, probably meant for kids but we adult kids thoroughly enjoyed the sensory input."
,,Beautifully restored building encapsulates the history of Singapore.,5.0,,"This was my first visit to the National Museum of Singapore. It is located adjacent to the YMCA on Orchard Rd. I was told the exhibits had been recently remodeled and I thought all of it was done with excellence. There are some high tech exhibits which are great fun for adults and children alike. I loved to read about the beginning of the diverse culture and the history of the island. I recommend a visit to anyone who wants to know the back story of this small island nation, now one of the most vibrant nations in the world."
,,Fabulous insight into this unique place,5.0,,An absolutely fascinating look into Singapore history some wonderful artefacts information about world war 2 colonial rule the struggle for independence the building itself is a great glimpse into Singapore past.
,,Very good museum,4.0,,"Although a large museum, the exibitions are relatively small so you do not fell overwhelmed. Has a very good history of early singapore and another relating to the fall of singapore and the recovery from the Japanese occupation. Well worth a visit."
,,Great introduction to Singapore,4.0,,"This is a really good example of a modern museum. The displays are well thought out and there is a good mix of text, photos and displays etc to keep you interested.

Having been through the ground floor, I came away knowing a lot more about the history of Singapore and the major events that shaped it as a country.

There‚Äôs a lot to see, so spare a few hours if you like to take it all in as I do!"
,,Old times,3.0,,"Nicely kept and well maintained old time Singapore building, you will pass and visit if on Singapore bus tour. Well worth visit to learn Singapore's history."
,,Very well done1,5.0,,Really enjoyed the layout of the museum and how easy it was to learn the history of the Island. Perhaps more time and space could be used to focus on the current state of affairs and future plans.
,,Unplanned visit,5.0,,"Worth the effort , coffee at the cafe particularly good. Layout a little confusing but a worthwhile visit. Can also use it to cut through to reach the Battle Box , useful when avoiding the humidity"
,,If you want to understand the history of Singapore this is the place,4.0,,The main exhibition provided a great overview of the discovery and settlement of Singapura and its journey to Singapore as it is known today. A must see if you want to understand the Singapore of today.
,,Brilliant,4.0,,"An excellent display if the history of Singapore through the ages. Well set out and detailed.
I joined a guided tour in Englidh that took ab out an hour, then I went back and covered the parts It missed out and those it covered that i wanted to see and read in more detail.
In an expensive city this was excellent value and well worth a few hours of the day"
,,Great visual arrangement of history material,5.0,,"Initially it was hard for me to follow the timeline or even get to understand what this was about. Passing half of the way did i finally know the history and beauty of it, quite late but still worth the try enjoy the trip. Things were arranged in good space."
,,Great Introduction to The Singapore Miracle,4.0,,"I found this a really fascinating museum showing how, under Lee Kuan Yew's leadership, Singapore exploited its few natural advantages to become a prosperous nation. Great section on the building of the high rise homes for workers that you will see if you take a bus or train into the suburbs"
,,Worthwhile attraction,5.0,,Great artefacts and tells the history of Singapore all through history until the present day. Worth the modest entry fee. Good caf√©/restaurant on site
,,Singapore history made easy!,5.0,,"You really get a sense of the story of Singapore in a stunning building. Some brilliant audio and vdieo to hear from people involved in more recent events.
The building has a pleasantly cool and spacious interior and the cafe serves a lovely peach yoghurt smoothy!
You can easily spend a couple of hours there."
,,Mr,5.0,,One of best museums I have visited. Everything was great strongly recommend a visit. Allow minimum of three hours for visit.
,,Exellent display of Old Singapore History to colonial occupation and Modern Singapore,5.0,,"The Museum has a variety of exhibit starting with early settlers of Singapore, then occupation by Dutch, English East India Company, joining of Malaysian Federation, then declaration of Independence by then Premier Lee Quan . The city is built by Indian convicts who were deported by the British to Singapore. They settled in an area called Little India, many of the decedents are now traders, businessmen and Politicians. The majority Chinese lives in harmony with Indians, Malays and other Nationality and city is an example of community harmony."
,,Great way to beat the heat and kill a couple of hrs,4.0,,Beautifully presented. Surprisingly modern inside given the magnificent heritage building it appears from the outside. Jagged by accident a free English guided tour which was very informative.
,,Detailed history of SG,4.0,,Visit this place to appreciate the transformation of Singapore from 3rd world to first world. From a fishing village to bustling metropolis.
,,History of Singapore,4.0,,It's the best place to study the history of Singapore. They simulate the rain forest electronically.
,,A must if you are interested in Singapore history,5.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore provides an extensive, well curated overview on Singapore's history. The exhibition is lively, with many movies, pictures, and audio files."
,,Surprisingly excellent,5.0,,"We had an afternoon to fill and were staying in nearby Bugis so decided to walk to the museum. My suggestion would be to only pay for the special exhibit if it especially interests you; the Polaroid theme seemed like it would be good but was a bit underwhelming. The regular history section on level 1 was spectacular. To me, it has the perfect mix of information panels, displays, videos and enough to keep you interested. The modern section was especially well done. We really enjoyed learning more about Singapore and how it came to be the place it is today. Also liked the glass rotunda which was unique and fascinating. We spent about 2 hours here and it was worth the visit!"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"My family and I had a three day stopover in Singapore. This was high on the TripAdvisor list and did not disappoint. I must admit, I was a little vague on the history of Singapore but this laid it all out in a logical and interesting manner. Level 1 gave you an overview from the 1400‚Äôs to now. Level 2 focused on more specific areas such as early colonial times, the Japanese occupation of WW II, the 60‚Äôs and the rise of Singapore as a nation. Staff were very well versed and helpful. If you only have a short time in Singapore, put the NMS on your list."
,,Enhances any trip to Singapore,5.0,,"Very quick to cruise around, this museum taught us a lot about the history of Singapore. When we stepped out, we saw the city and the people of this great country in a new light."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"Very interesting and well produced museum about the national history of Singapore. If you have any interest in the history of this nation, a visit to the museum is a must. Don't miss the nice cafe in the atrium for a snack or lunch."
,,Really good,5.0,,"I first came here six years ago, and remember it to be outstanding. It has changed since then (or I have forgotten completely), so it was well worth revisiting.

I didn‚Äôt bother with the special exhibitions. But the main ones tell the story of Singapore from the 14th century through to the present day. The surprise surrender of the British in 1941 and the tough period of Japanese occupation until the end of World War II, which eventually culminated in full independence in 1965, is well told.

Upstairs, there are four smaller galleries which tell you how the people of Singapore experienced different periods of history - from the lively 1920s and 30s, through to the explosion of modernity in the 1970s and 80s.

I spent just over two hours here in total. And metres away from the helter skelter shopping district on Orchard Road, it was good to learn Singapore‚Äôs real story (again)."
,,First rate museum,5.0,,"So much to see here. I recommend going as soon as you arrive in Singapore as it gives you a clear picture of Singapore's fascinating, albeit short, history. We loved the exhibition of tree photos and the Story of the Forest light display in the dome is absolutely unmissable. An outstanding museum."
,,Excellent museum,5.0,,"This was a very educational museum. We took the free English guided tour, and the guide provided us with an excellent demonstration of the museum. The entrance cost was 15 sd for adults. Highly recommended."
,,This is an absolute must visit.,5.0,,The National Museum of Singapore is a must visit to understand the historical aspects of Singapore from a settlement to a City and for the understanding of the uniqueness of the Singaporean.
,,Good Information and Interesting History,4.0,,Loved the Rainforest exhibit by Japan. Very interesting. Also loved that they had sections divided by centuries. Interesting way to explore Singaporean History and culture.
,,Worth a visit if you want to know history of Singapore,4.0,,"It is the oldest museum in Singapore and dates back to 1887.There are several different permanent exhibitions. One of the exhibits provides information on early years of Singapore, tumultuous 1950s and what is modern Singapore"
,,"Beautiful building, excellent exhibits.",5.0,,"This is one of the best curated museums i have been in that has a historical elememt to it. The permanent exhibits are interesting, varied and offer hands on/interactive elements as well as the standard display cases and videos. Well worth a visit!"
,,Give it a miss,1.0,,"Really more of a contemporary art gallery than a museum, we only spent a few minutes here before deciding it was not our type of museum, although others with different interests may enjoy it."
,,Historical preview of Singapore,5.0,,"Excellent presentation and display thru many centuries, invaders, leaders, contributors and historical sacrifices this beautiful island has been thru and the incredible place it is at now in the world.
Most informative and detailed so all ages can understand the content.
The new building annex tunnel is magnificent. Especially with the Flora and Fauna show currently on display.
A Must SEE!!"
,,memorable experience!,5.0,,"In the cool setting of the National Museum it is easy to while away half a day or more. First thing to note is the setting. An excellent example of a historical building interacting with a modern annex providing a glorious space to wander within.

Remember - if you have a recent Singapore Airlines boarding pass you could be eligible for additional savings. I received a 50% discount on the SGD$10 admission price.

The main gallery to visit is the History of Singapore using the interactive companion providing audio and visual information. The wealth of information available on this set is huge. Almost every exhibit in this section will have a number next to it and when input into the companion more data is provided be it audio, text, or video. There is actually too much information and you do have to be selective on what information you're interested in else you'll be there to closing time."
,,Simply excellent Museum,5.0,,"Excellent museum - good value, lots to see and fantastic for explaining the unique history and development of Singapore. The 'Story of the Forest' exhibition is outstanding."
,,Historical building and Museum,4.0,,"Worth the visit for the building's architecture in itself. It's a welcome respite in the ultra-modern glass jungle of center city. The collections are not extraordinary, but they are very well presented, the light is carefully thought out, and the rooms are esthetically pleasing.
I didn't find the history of the island very well explained, if anything it made me buy a history book at the bookshop."
,,"Worth a Visit, Perhaps",4.0,,"I have good news and bad news. The good news is the National Museum of Singapore‚Äôs historic precedence over every other national museum in Southeast Asia. The NMS, then called the Raffles Museum, was founded in 1849. Its closest competitor, Indonesia‚Äôs museum, dates from 1862. The Thais opened theirs in 1874; the Cambodians in 1920; the Burmese and Vietnamese in the 1950s; the Malaysians in the ‚Äò60s, and the Lao in the ‚Äò70s. (I‚Äôve been to all of them, and some, more than once.) So the NMS‚Äôs institutional history goes back much further than any of these other museums.

The bad news is that it‚Äôs the exact opposite when it comes to the actual histories of the nations themselves. The Rangoon museum has a large gallery full of Pyu-period Buddhas going back 2,000 years. The Phnom Penh museum has magnificent Khmer artefacts going back 1,300 years. The Bangkok museum has a complete Siamese chess set and KL‚Äôs has a Perak bronze Bodhisattva, both created while Europe was still in its Dark Ages. Jakarta has a courtyard packed with stacks of thousand-year-old stone carvings, apparently because they ran out of space inside the building. Hanoi has fabulous artefacts going back 3,000 years, and even Vientiane has Megalithic standing stones. Singapore, on the other hand, was an insignificant backwater until 200 years ago. Don‚Äôt expect thousand-year-old Singaporean bronzes, weapons, tapestries, ceramics, jade necklaces or ivory carvings in the NMS: you‚Äôre as likely to find ancient Singaporean ice skates.

For a brief period, 700 years ago, the island may (or may not) have had a modest trading settlement, as ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù by a handful of gold armlets and rings found on Fort Canning Hill, and as romanticized in a book of Malay Annals that are about as historically trustworthy as the tales of Sindbad‚Äôs voyages. With a straight face, the Annals‚Äô author assures us that the mighty founder of this long-lost Kingdom of Singapura, Sang Nila Utama, was a direct descendant of Alexander the Great (who lived 1600 years earlier) and that Singapura was finally destroyed after a siege that rivalled that of Troy, when the Javanese attacked it (with an army of 200,000 warriors)! Though this story is patently preposterous, you can nevertheless find a brand-new government-issued heroic statue of Sang Nila Utama down on Boat Quay near where Sir Stamford Raffles landed, Raffles himself being a direct descendant of King Agamemnon‚Äîoops, sorry, check that; I meant to say of Ben and Annie Raffles.

So we‚Äôre left with an absolutely splendid national history museum building, but a history that only goes back 10% or so of the historical time-lines of every other SE Asian country. The NMS‚Äôs curators are up to this challenge, however: they give a tip o‚Äô the hat to the pre-1818 history of the islands, and then realistically focus on the last 200 years.

The Building: The colonial government opened a grand neo-Palladian museum in 1887, on the tail end of Queen Victoria‚Äôs Golden Jubilee year, and the building‚Äôs immense facade resonates with Imperial pomp and pride. On either end of the facade, pediments bear the United Kingdom‚Äôs royal coat of arms, and between them is a grand dome, trumping the Roman model with stained glass all around its base. Inside, the gleaming white rotunda is spectacular; its Roman arches, half-pillars, and black wrought-iron balustrades make for some obvious photo-ops. However, the museum‚Äôs interior isn‚Äôt at all hidebound and Victorian: you‚Äôll walk along stunning 21st century glass-roofed passageways and courtyards, and many of the exhibits themselves employ cutting-edge technology (see Pediment, Rotunda, Balustrade, and 21st Century photos).

You should find enough interesting exhibits to last you for several hours. There‚Äôs a large room full of fashionable clothing from the 1900s to 1930s, including a formal dress uniform, a white linen tropical suit, flapper dresses, formal gowns, and my favourite: a set of khakis ‚Äîpith helmet and all‚Äîthat the famous Singapore-based zoo-collector Frank Buck might have worn when he was off trapping tigers and pythons. These aren‚Äôt re-creations: they were all dug out from old family cedar chests. (see Dress Uniform, Tropical Suit, and Khakis photos). On the opposite end of the social scale, you can find grim 1890s-era photographs taken inside an opium den (see Opium Den and Opium Den 2 photos: on the first photo the opium den door appears to be bolted and padlocked, never a good sign if you‚Äôre a paying customer).

One artefact might be of particular interest to Americans and older Britons: the Revere Bell. This bell was cast in Boston by the Revere family, and donated to St Andrews by the daughter of Paul Revere (the silversmith whose ‚ÄúMidnight Ride‚Äù precipitated America‚Äôs Revolutionary War and Declaration of Independence), with her stipulation that the bell must be rung every night at eight o‚Äôclock sharp to alert every sailor in town to immediately finish his grog and re-board his ship (being a proper Bostonian, she was rather puritanical about drunken sailors). Older Britons will of course immediately realize that (1) having a single church-bell shut down every pub in town simultaneously is much more efficient than expecting every publican in Singapore to be equipped with both a reliable timepiece and a small bell to ring as he calls out ‚Äútime, gentlemen, time please‚Äù and (2) having to close pubs at 8:00 pm is even worse than those aggravating tavern times under the Defence of the Realm Act. Unfortunately, the Revere Bell had a fatal flaw and is no longer in operation. Fortunately, the same is true of the Defence of the Realm Act. (See Revere Bell and Bell Inscription photos).

The materials on Singapore during the 1942-1945 Japanese occupation were extremely interesting, bringing home what daily life was like to regular Singaporean citizens. I particularly admired the Japanese movie poster in English about a blockbuster new movie coming to a Singapore theatre near you, which will use ‚Äúactual battle footage‚Äù to show Singaporeans ‚Äúhow the invincible Imperial Army brought THE FALL OF SINGAPORE.‚Äù This action-packed thriller was produced by the Press Section of the Yamashita Corps itself. I‚Äôd be interested in seeing that film, even though I know how the sequel ends: the Imperial Army turns out to be vincible after all, and Yamashita himself gets hanged for war crimes (though the Manila ones, not the Singapore ones; see the Fall of Singapore Poster photo).

Finally, there are the ten national treasures. Don‚Äôt expect Lion Thrones or Jade Buddhas, but NMS is doing the best it can. One of the treasures is that Javanese gold jewellery. At the time they were probably buried, the Strait offshore had a serious piracy problem: nearby Bintan Island alone was said to have harboured 300 pirate ships (perhaps another fabulous exaggeration). No Javanese jewellery is Singapore-made of course, and it might well be buried pirate loot rather than proof of a long-lost trading centre on Singapura Island, but as the only ancient gold horde ever discovered in Singapore, it will have to do.

Of the other national treasures, two stand out in my opinion:

First, a full-length portrait of Sir Frank Swettenham, done by John Singer Sargent. It‚Äôs a splendid painting, and Swettenham was a remarkable man. As a national treasure, it would have been equally or even more appropriate for Malaysia‚Äôs national museum (which does have an imposing statue of him in front of it). Swettenham was one of about three dozen governors that Singapore had over 140 years of British rule, and his 4-year term was about par. However, during his tenure, he pursued a policy of trying to pry away Siam‚Äôs tributary states of Kelantan and Trengganu and absorb them into the British Empire. His immediate success was limited to King Rama the Great reluctantly agreeing to appoint British advisers to these provinces, but the eventual result was to transfer sovereignty of both provinces, as well as Kedah, to the British, and hence to modern Malaysia. (To the credit of the Thai monarchy, however, Siam was the only Asian coastal nation from the Mediterranean to the South China Sea, that was never under either European rule or European occupation). Sargent‚Äôs heroic portrait shows Swettenham in a dress uniform that is identical to the one mentioned above, but with the addition of the star of St. Michael and St. George, and a dress sword. If you think Sargent depicts him as a strong-willed man, an uncompromising imperialist, and perhaps a bit of a cad, both you and the artist might be correct.

Second, the William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings. William Farquhar was the military engineer who blew the historic walls of Malacca to smithereens (on strict orders) prior to Malacca‚Äôs restoration to the Dutch, though Raffles urged him not to; when the Brits and Dutch then negotiated a treaty under which Britain wound up keeping Malacca after all, Farquhar was the goat, and Raffles got the credit for having been right. Farquhar spoke Malay fluently and negotiated the treaty that ceded the rights to Singapore to the UK, at which point Raffles sailed in, signed the treaty and got full credit for it. Farquhar was the Resident who built up Singapore during its first four formative years, at which point Raffles sailed in and promptly dismissed Farquhar. Farquhar formally complained of his treatment, and the Company directors sided with Raffles. Raffles and Farquhar both had roads named after them in Singapore; nowadays there‚Äôs both a Raffles Blvd and a Raffles Avenue, while Farquhar‚Äôs road was obliterated 15 years ago, and no Singapore road now bears his name. There‚Äôs a Raffles Place and a Raffles Hotel; you‚Äôll look in vain for Farquhar counterparts. There actually still is a Farquhar Terrace on one edge of Fort Canning Hill; I never sit downhill from it, expecting the freak landslide any day now. Every time they interacted, Raffles wound up coming out on top, and Farquhar on the bottom. Both men were avid naturalists; the largest flower on Earth is named after Raffles; Farquhar never even got a weed named after him. Both men commissioned drawings of flora and fauna. Farquhar‚Äôs collection of natural history drawings wasn‚Äôt bad, not bad at all; but Raffles‚Äô collection was bigger and better and also included Java, so he even came out on top for natural history drawing collections. Sir Stamford Raffles then sailed back home to high honours in England. But hold on; what‚Äôs this? Before arriving back in Blighty, Raffles‚Äô ship caught fire and his collection of natural history drawings went up in flames, leaving only Farquhar‚Äôs as a unique collection dating from the birth of Singapore. A great loss to the field of natural history, of course, much to be regretted; but finally, FINALLY something worked out with Farquhar on top of Raffles! The Chinese artists Farquhar used were quite good, and the drawings, like those of Audubon, are works of art. Of all ten national treasures, this is the one you‚Äôll probably spend the most time looking at. You could actually spend more time on these beautiful drawings, than the other nine treasures combined.

I‚Äôm giving the National Museum of Singapore 4 stars, which might not be fair, but if I rated it 5, that would mean that I think it‚Äôs as worthwhile as the Singapore Zoo, the Southern Ridges, the Botanical Gardens, Sultan Mosque, Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Gardens by the Bay, and Clarke Quay (I could add more). My instinct is that if you‚Äôre spending two weeks or so as a tourist in Singapore, you should by all means visit the NMS. But if you‚Äôre only here for a week or less, the NMS should be lower down on your agenda, particularly if this is your first visit to Asia, because then Kampong Glam, Chinatown, Little India, and the Museum of Asian Civilizations might all be more worthwhile and memorable. I do think the NMS is the best curated and most innovative national history museum in SE Asia; architecturally the museum is second only to Bangkok‚Äôs. But its collection cannot compete against those other countries, each with a rich and long history. Even some smaller museums, such as the Cham Sculpture Museum in Da Nang, beat the NMS on that score. So: Very Good, yes; but Essential, no."
,,Our Night Visit on 2 Feb (Light to Night Festival Jan 18 - Feb 24),5.0,,My cousin and I visited the Museum just 2 hours before it closes during the exceptional visitor hours due to the Light to Night Festival. We had a wonderful time exploring and learning as there were many interesting exhibits and crowd was few at that hour. Well-done to the management!
,,Wonderful historic display,4.0,,This museum is well worth a visit it shows the the growth of Singapore in many interactive displays Each area shows a different era of Singapore‚Äôs growth
,,Go for the architecture,5.0,,"Designed in the Neo Palladian and Renaissance style. It has two glass rotundas, designed by I.M. Pei. The exhibits focus on the history of Singapore."
,,Best place to learn about the History of Singapore !!!,5.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore is the oldest museum in Singapore. It was basically started as a section of a library at Singapore Institution called the Raffles Library and Museum way back in 1849. It was relocated on several occasions and finally in 1887 it moved to its permanent present site on Stamford Road.

The museum has many exhibits related to the history of Singapore. It is one of 4 national museums in the country. It was named the National Museum of Singapore in 1965. It was known as the Singapore History Museum for few years.

It is a nice place to have a peaceful experience and know in detail about this country. Entry fee i nominal and is recommended for visit especially if you have kids travelling with you to enrich their knowledge."
,,Very worthwhile,4.0,,"If you are a history fan or if you just want a break from the Singapore hustle & bustle then
the National Museum of Singapore is well worth a visit. The main exhibit features a creative & informative exhibition on Singapore's history & the section on WWII was especially informative. It's located right next to Fort Canning park which is well worth a stroll around."
,,Nice,4.0,,"Started off a little weak with the 4 rooms that capture from the early 1900's on, but got significantly better from there. The halls with the real history were illustrated well with some very interesting pieces like a bell from the Paul Revere Foundry. Definitely worth the time. The building is spectacular as well."
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"A great balance of interesting exhibits whilst not becoming overwhelming as some museums can be. Freindly helpful staff who were happy to explain in more detail if you had questions. The experience of the forest was wonderful, very relaxing watching petals fall and rise on the celing whilst listening to relaxing music truly great Was a little difficult to find due to roadworks in the area at the moment but worth the effort to find"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,If you want to know the history of Singapore then look no further. The museum has fantastic galleries about Singapore. I have learnt a lot. The building itself is beautiful. I enjoyed the gallery of The story of forest.
,,Well worth it,4.0,,"Spent about 3 hours here and found it a perfect rainy day activities. Give an interest in wwii was pleased with the exhibits on that period. Much rah rah for the political leadership in Singapore, but that is to be expected."
,,Nice exposition perfect lunch,4.0,,Saw an expo know the origins of Singapore and a very impressive computer simulated animal/ wildlife show. Lunch was impressive.
,,A Must Do!,5.0,,"At the beginning we really didn‚Äôt know what was there because we didn‚Äôt find recommendations about it. Thank God we went, spectacular well structured museum which broadens your knowledge and information on Singapore history. A must!!"
,,It has more than you expect,5.0,,"You can spend at least 3 hours here. Learn about the history of Singapore and experience an amazing immersive multimedia experience called the ""Story of the Forest"". It was mesmerizing! Saw lots of people just lying down and looking really relaxed! Best enjoyed when less people are there. Recommend going late before closing like 4pm and see this installation at 6pm. You might get the whole space to yourself! Terribly romantic if you intend to propose to your other half too! (I think! Since I am already married )"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"A stunningly beautiful building located opposite Fort Canning Park, which you can explore at the same time. You are able to get a real sense of Singapore‚Äôs History with some stand out items such as the jewellery found in an archaeological dig of Forbidden Hill. You need a few hours to fully appreciate the exhibits. Great cafes there too. Highly recommend."
,,Beautiful and inerresting,5.0,,All of the Fort Canning area is so interesting. You can walk around the old cemetery with tombstones from old Brits--many children who died in early 1800s--anad then come into the cool air-con of the museum to learn the history.
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,An absolutely fantastic museum - thank you to Jillian for the most amazing tour (a must do 11am daily). I spent 5hrs in here and didn‚Äôt see it all! I wouldn‚Äôt bother with the special exhibition ticket next time however the exhibit on Polaroids was interesting. Thank you for a wonderful day!
,,Stunning architecture as well as lovely and cool inside.,5.0,,"Our only problem was that we ran out of time for a more comprehensive visit to the museum as planned, instead of forgoing a visit we decided to explore as much of the musuem as possible for free as our time permitted and enjoy the air-conditioning.

From the outside the building is beautiful with its large prominent dome, all painted white and grey, the front part of the building was built in 1887 in European style, once inside the foyer near the ticket office, some of its features reminded me of the San Francisco City Hall on a smaller scale.

The ticket office kindly informed us that there was a free exhibition on the lower ground which we could visit, 'Italy: The beauty of knowledge'. We thoroughly enjoyed this exhibition spending forty minutes or so before heading up to the museum's bookstore located next to the museum's cafe. My advice is to allow at least two to three hours or more to visit this beautiful organised musuem and its architecture, both old and new."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Great place, loved taking my Grand- daughter around and leaning the history of Singapore, Super cafe to rest your legs after you have been round!"
,,Well-done museum,5.0,,"While there are several exhibits, the real star is the History of Singapore gallery. I really learned a lot about Singapore and upstairs has even more exhibits on modern times. We went on New Years Day and it was free! (apparently as for all public holidays). Nice colonial building as well."
,,Finally some roots,3.0,,"In this artificial city where everything seems plastic, finally a place where some light is cast on the roots of the population.
The story is clearly a marketed message, not very deep or critical, but one's can extract some interesting intuitions.
The visit is quick, the venue is central, overall an activity preferable to the other city museums."
,,National museum,5.0,,"We loved the national museum, there is the history of the island with displays and videos, suitable for all ages! Truly fabulous and not to be missed"
,,Excellent,5.0,,Well laid out. Great visuals and commentaries. Informative look at this country‚Äôs history. Excellent resource. Take your time to look at all the galleries and listen to the oral histories. Allow 3 hours. Closes at 7pm so a great late afternoon experience.
,,Enjoyable Museum!,4.0,,"Love the museum at the first sight, the architecture is nice. Love the details they have inside and outside the building. They have free area to visit and somekind of gallery that you need to buy tickets. I regret I didn‚Äôt buy one though. The free area has few rooms of singapore important phase of history. Each room has different ambient and amazing details to enjoy. Their interior is great for taking pics! And they have little souvenir corner enough for you to buy some unique souvenirs. My favourite part is their multimedia room that shows typical singapore village in a super wide screen. They have bean bags in this room so you can just lay down, enjoy the ac and rest your feet after walking around. Enjoyable!"
,,Singapore Museum,5.0,,Great place to start to learn about singapore. Loved it.Old kampong /village sites and the wars Singapore has survived. Do visit.
,,An interesting collection,5.0,,National Museums is for museum lovers. Must keep checking for ongoing exhibitions . The museum if free for Singaporeans and PRs
,,Worthy of a Visit,5.0,,"The National Gallery was excellent to visit, but it's difficult (and not advised) to rush through. The design of the building, alone, and the history of the buildings is very interesting and well documented and explained at one of the exhibits. I loved my time at this place. The restaurant on the upper deck was also very good."
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"Interesting way to find about the history of Singapore. Well laid out and very informative. Perfect place to spend 2 or 3 hours, especially if it's raining."
,,Nice exhibits,4.0,,We took an hour long tour of the national museum of singapore. The exhibits are interesting and we had an amazing time.
,,The Making of Singapore,5.0,,"This museum displays a chronicle of Singapore that is very intriguing, you are taken through the museum from the birth of Singapore to present day, many displays have audio commentary which is very helpful, small entry fee applies.."
,,Excellent Displays,5.0,,"The museum is in the heart of the town, a short walk from most major hotels. The building is very nice and fittingly historic. There are several very interesting electronic displays over many levels inside and these are great for kids especially. They are a very unique way to showcase the island wildlife. The old Singapore displays are interesting, as are the items from the opium trade era. The WW2 displays featuring a Japanese tank are very interesting and unique as well. Overall an excellent way to spend a few hours."
,,Not as great as before,3.0,,"I visited the museum some years ago and recently returned to find that it has been somewhat renovated. When I visited 7 years ago , there was an excellent multi-layered presentation with information from scholars to short description on objects presented via an electronic gadget and visitors could choose from a personal or official path to learn about Singapore's history. It appears that some sections have been removed, and there is no e-device that offers more depth info for self tours. The history gallery has adopted a more parochial look and the galleries on the upper levels are simplistic and generally poorly designed with the exception of the Modern gallery which was quite charming."
,,Excellent,5.0,,I visited this museum today and was very impressed. I arrived at 11am in time for a tour which just made the place come alive. My guide was originally from Holland and had been living in Singapore for 8 years - she was excellent. Knowledgeable and entertaining and kept the pace moving. I really do recommend this event. The galleries are so informative and interactive nothing old or static about this place. The cafe was excellent too. Highly recommended.
,,Not only for history freaks,5.0,,"History comes in many forms and this museum certainly provides you with choices. Reconstructions of rooms, interactive exhibits, political speeches presentations, explanations of cultural differences, all contribute to a better understanding of the history of Singapore. A must."
,,Don't miss the museum!,5.0,,We really enjoyed the museum and its fun exhibits. A must see in Singapore. The story of the forest was really unexpected and a very high tech exhibit.
,,Well worth the time to find,5.0,,"What an amazing building and museum, well laid out it set out the history and culture of Singapore in a fantastic and colourful manner, well worth taking the time to explore."
,,What a delightful place to visit!,5.0,,"My spouse and I have visited the National Museum of Singapore before, but we always learn something new with each visit. This time, we had a different guide and, of course, she emphasized different facts. Still a fascinating experience. Do It!"
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,Worth the price and very interesting museum. Well maintained and learn a lot about Singapore after the visit here.
,,A MUST visit!,5.0,,"Anyone interested in understanding the history of Singapore should start with the National Museum of Singapore; from there explore Chinatown, the Hindu and Malay districts, the Arab quarter, and then the Anglo/European parts, including the Battlebox. Singapore is about so much more than the shopping! We spent 4 hours at the museum, and could have stayed longer. Note it has two very nice restaurants for lunch!"
,,Can I go again please.,5.0,,"Wow, this is the way museums should be. Interesting, informative and fun for both adults and children. The best bit was the magical Forest light show. Please please let me have this in my bedroom. It‚Äôs like living in the film Avatar. Soooo beautiful."
,,Interactive exhibitions,4.0,,"The exhibitions are well laid out, informative and easy to follow. Lots to see and easy to spend several hours taking it all in as it covers all of Singapore‚Äôs history. Don‚Äôt miss the story of the forest in the rotunda!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,I don‚Äôt know this place is exist!! I mean it‚Äôs soooooo beautiful and also the arts are beautiful too!!
,,beautful building and interesting exhibitions,4.0,,"beautful building, really interesting exhitions detailing the history of Singapore. I found some of the exhibits a little too staged, however you get used to that in Singapore"
,,Great museum,4.0,,I really enjoyed my time here. Its a great museum to visit and pretty big. I found my visit fun and educational
,,"Interactive, Informative, Interesting Exhibits",5.0,,"On a rainy day in Singapore we took shelter inside the National Museum. Upon entering I had no knowledge about the history of Singapore and the turmoils they faced during World War II (I am not into History). However after exploring for a few hours I was enlightened. The interactive, visually appealing, informative exhibits made me clearly aware of their History. There is so much to see and learn from fashion and toys, daily life and traditions, the island's development and extracts from WWII. You can even have a whiff of different sought-out plants in one gallery. I really enjoyed the interactivity. The Glass Rotunda was an amazing sight. The beautiful, majestic images on large, clear pictured screens was mesmerising. At the bottom in the enclosed room we laid down on the ground and watched the floor to ceiling pictures for about 20 minutes as they changed and evolved. It was relaxing and pleasing."
,,Nice museum on the history of Singapore,4.0,,"Good exhibits retracing the history of Singapore, from ancient times to today. Well laid out, lots of interesting items. In an old Colonial era building, but entirely renovated with a modern annex at the back. Great aircon: was nice to get away from the heat outside for a couple of hours! Next to Fort Canning Park, which is worth a look as well"
,,Great museum,4.0,,Definitely worth a visit. Great displays showing the history of this fantastic island. Good value for money.easy accessible from Fort Canning MRT
,,Very interesting and well laid out museum,5.0,,"This is a small museum, easily seen in an hour or so. I learned a great deal about Singapore's past and present. The museum is well laid out, with clear explanations through written signs and some short films. There are English tours but we went on our own. Admission is free."
,,Special,5.0,,Good use of latest tech. Design is an attractive blend of old and new. See each rotunda. A century apart. Great social history. And for an American who knew little of Singapore‚Äôs history I learned tons.
,,Museum review,5.0,,"Take sometime to visit National Museum of Singapore to gain some history insight of this tiny red dot, from a small trading village to a world class nation. Set aside a couple of hours to your iteneary here in Singapore. Fort canning hill, situated just behind it is good to go too to get an in depth of Singapore's history."
,,History od singapore + air con,4.0,,Great exhibit on Singapore history! Good value (15 spd) and excellent place to learn about Singapore history. It's very well done! You can come and go as you like all day as long as you keep your sticker. Great place to escape the heat and cool down. Easy access to the MRT.
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"This museum presents the history of Singapore back through the century rise but for me the WWI and II exhibition is poinient and well done. The glass rotunda is s complete contrast which presents everything to do with forrest‚Äôs in a unique way - so enchanting.
Definitely a must see - so enjoyable."
,,The history and culture of Singapore,4.0,,"This museum doesn't have many objects on display, but through its audio-visual displays does give you a clear understanding of the history and culture of Singapore."
,,Fascinating history,4.0,,"I think Singapore has the most unique history of the last 50 years of all of the 40 countries I have visited. I wanted to learn how it had become a super power so quickly. I felt I could have learned more here, however, it was just enough information without overload and sore feet. The museum has whet my appetite to learn more about his extraordinary country. Having come to this museum, I am proud to have chosen to visit Singapore as a tourist, having been here for business and stopovers a few times. I thoroughly receommend."
,,Museum not a benchmark,3.0,,This particular one charges $15 per ticket unlike other museums in Europe which are mostly free! The inside is not so great as their history is also not that old and colourful!! End of the day not worth it .
,,Marvellous,5.0,,"During the heat of the day this place provides a welcome respite.
I thought it was an incredibly, informative and engaging interactive journey through the history of Singapore.
The standout for me was the beautiful, immersive 'story of the forest' by Team Lab.
I could have lay on the floor of the space for hours it was so beautiful.
I noted the YMCA is right next door. I believe the current building stands on the site of the old YMCA which was an interrogation and torture site during the Japanese occupation of WWII.
Thought provoking stuff"
,,reworked but still not going thru,2.0,,"as few years ago the place was closed and we had time in this visit - we tried.
not to the point - nice as children place - not serious for adults that want real facts and not a simple (very simple) presentation.
I wanted to see more of the life and got general stories and some pictures...
unless you are with children - not a requirement in any visit to Singapore"
,,Fascinating place.,5.0,,So glad we visited this fascinating place....very close to our hotel so thought it would be somewhere nice and clean and cool to visit and it certainly was that. Read up on the history of the place and take your time looking around.....again very helpful people available.
,,Excellent Innovative Museum,5.0,,Very well designed modern museum with immersive exhibits. The history of Singapore is very well presented through immersive displays with lots of great multimedia content. The special exhibits were also very interesting as is the building itself a hybrid of the old museum joined to its new modern wing.
,,Really good,5.0,,A really pleasent experience among museums. I really enjoyed this way of learning the history of Singapore
,,We sent hours here,5.0,,"Every country I've been too have a museum . This one is so good as it's not a general museum but it tells the story of Singapore. Anyone British should be proud of Singapore. They are members of the commonwealth. Their soldiers fought in the first and Second World War side by side with the U.K. Singapore love the queen and most speak English.
I found out that business's are often linked to UK companies such as Dysons. The building is Victorian and well worth looking around for the building alone. Coin, invaders, discoverers all feature. Wonderful paintings and displays. I think it's an unmissable site do visit."
,,Tour with a Guide,5.0,,What amazing architecture and definitely take advantage of the opportunity to tour the Museum with a volunteer guide.
,,"Spot on museum,",5.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore is one of the finest museums I‚Äôve visited. It‚Äôs up-to-date, comprehensively filled with exhibits that are highly informative and logically laid out. You can spend a good half-day there at least and still want to go back for more!"
,,It was just amasing.,4.0,,We went there on our last day and it was very nice and educational. If you have time to go there go its interesting to learn more about Singapore and the life.
,,Outstanding!,5.0,,"An interactive, full senses immersion exploration of the history of Singapore. From the 1200s onwards. Beautifully laid out and chock full of relevant artifacts and objects. We did not need a guide or tour, but were perfectly fine pottering along at our own pace.

My teen son loved this more than all the other activities we've done this trip.

Gorgeous merger of colonial and modern architecture to boot.

A hearty thanks to Givaudan for teaming up with the museum to provide olfactory delights along the way. More of this in museums and galleries across the globe, please!"
,,History of Singapore,4.0,,"Entrance was SG$15 adult. There was a restaurant inside; it looked very nice, but I didn‚Äôt get to try. Gift shop was a small kiosk. History museum was very nicely curated. About 2hours walk from pre-colonial to present. Then there were the special exhibits."
,,Interesting museum,4.0,,"A very good museum which covers the history of Singapore up to modern times in a descriptive and matter of fact way, using a good range of artefacts. We also had drinks at the cafe, which was very pleasant, with a good menu, although service was a little slow."
,,Take your time,5.0,,We spent 2 hours here without stopping for coffee. The history and explanations as well as the hi-tech visuals really intrigued us.We were lucky enough to hear the last few minutes of a tour that helped us understand the most current reality of Singapore. We highly recommend visiting this museum.Singapore is so much more than shopping and the extravagant parks and buildings.
,,Wonderful museum,5.0,,What an incredible museum! This is definitely a must see attraction. The glass rotunda is amazing. It provides the story of the forest in an interactive digital art format. The museum tells the history of Singapore and details life in Singapore over the past 100 years.
,,Great way to spend a few hours in Singapore,5.0,,The National Museum was one of the stops on our hop on/ hop off bus tour and turned out to be one of the highlights of our visit to Singapore. We were lucky enough to arrive just in time to join the English Speaking Tour. it was so informative and provided the historical overview of Singapore I had been looking for. Entrance to the Museum is a tad expensive but worth it to learn about such an interesting history and to gain an insight into Singaporean life.
,,Great for an historical overview.,4.0,,"Visited on first day, was great to gain a historical overview before starting our tours. Couple of hours is adequate. We then walked through the rear exit into Canning park, walked to Clarke‚Äôs quay via the spice garden etc."
,,Unexpected Major Highlight,5.0,,"Visited The National Museum earlier this week during a business/pleasure trip to Singapore. Thought this would be a nice way to kill a couple of hours in between a meeting and evening activities! Caught the 4 PM English speaking tour performed by a volunteer of the museum. We started out with 8 people in the group but 1 hour and 20 minutes later by the end of the tour it seemed like it expanded to around 40. It was done by a retired native Singaporean who lived through a lot of the history and he brought it all to life! Such a special memory, one of the highlights of our remarkable stay in Singapore all for the price of admission!"
,,Singapore history explained,5.0,,"The story of Singapore's history, especially the progress made after gaining independence, was truly remarkable."
,,The wonderful architecture museum,5.0,,"I came here to visit the Renoir Exhibition. It is very great exhibition. And the dome at the rooftop inside the museum is also wonderful, the real hidden place for me!"
,,Cultural and Architectural landmark,5.0,,"This Museum gives the visitor a very good overview of Singapore history with static displays and images and video montages of everyday life. On Level 1, The History Gallery showcases the development of the country from early beginnings 700 years ago through the colonial period, the Japanese Occupation, Independence and the establishment of the modern City. On Level 2, take a walk through the past 100 years for a more detailed understanding of e City's history to the present day. The Goh Seng Choo Gallery explores the world of magic and beliefs as practised by traditional SE Asian societies. Take the lift to the top of the Rotunda and as you descend the walkway, enjoy the digital displays and photograph exhibition.
Take time to enjoy the architecture of this beautiful building and the dome that sits at the front of the building. Wonderful place to immerse yourself for 3 - 4 hours or more."
,,Excellent story on Singapore History and much more,5.0,,"Currently there is very good Internatioal Press Photo Exebition which reminds you on so a lot of things which are not so good in this world.....
A must for better understanding Singapore history are the excellent special presentations.
For kids and adults do not miss the forest story ....
Clearly a must even for a short time Traveller.
With this simple Singapore Tourist Pass for MRT you get 5 SGD reduction."
,,A trip into the past,5.0,,"A trip into the past; when you have no other plans and it‚Äôs a national holiday most
of museums in Singapore are having free entrance.
I loved the Asia traditional painting collections; I am a fan of traditional Chinese ink paintings
In this museum you can find lots of new exiting collections everytime.
The architecture itself of this beautiful museum makes also the subject of a tour"
,,"This is a great museum, with some fantastic displays",5.0,,"I've been to this museum twice, and I really rate it!! It doesn't look much from the outside, and even the first few rooms you visit are ok, but once past those it really take off.
It explains the history of Singapore very well over time.
Make the time to visit!!!"
,,Impressed,5.0,,"I took the MRT and alighted at Shiny Ghaur station. Exit A and and a right turn and you are there with a 5 minute walk. Nice juxtaposition of old renaissance and modern architecture on display. The rich tapestry of Singapore's history is authenticity captured in the displays. Worth the visit to learn more about the 'little red dot. The 2nd World War section was emotional with the best and worst of mankind there to see. Apart from a very unpleasant odour in this particular area, the whole thing was faultless. I suggest tagging along with one of the guided tours as you will certainly learn more that way. There is English and Chinese speaking tours. There is also good coffee in the cafe with its nice peaceful setting on the ground floor. There is also a 60+ discount if you have reached that age milestone, which I have recently done!"
,,Superb Historical Museum Providing A Great Insights on Singapore's History and Culture.,5.0,,"A lovely Museum housed in a historical building which has been renovated like most museums with a modern fusion. The exhibitions are well designed and easy to follow. They provide a comprehensive overview of Singapore's history and culture. Guided tours are available but not necessary as all information is in English. The displays of Antiques and Vintage items is fascinating as well. Currently the Story of the Forrest is been exhibited, entry is from Level 2, Glass Rotunda. This digital art is stunning as it takes you down to other levels and exhibits. The Eateries are also a pleasant way to relax before or after viewing."
,,Interesting - both for locals and visitors,4.0,,"This is a lovely museum in which there is so much to see. It's got a lovely 'walk through the ages' type of exposition about Singapore. So much to learn and see and all very nicely done.
Once you have purchased tickets, you can choose to be taken round by a guide (free of charge- they are all highly trained volunteers), or stroll around by yourself, at your own pace.
A great place for all ages.
There is a cafe inside which sells delicious cakes - but if you walk round the corner there is a Janice Wong cafe for chocolate lovers (also very tasty lunch menu!)."
,,Impressionist Art Exhibitions,5.0,,"Thumbs up for guided tour by advance registration on the same day/ audio-aid tour/ on your own at your own pace tour. Besides emotion and thought-evoking paintings, it provides history on the resilient spirit of impressionist artists to overcome conventions and constraints to add colours to their otherwise black and white arts, thanks to new colours invented by Scientisrs. I am very gratified to be able to appreciate my long-beloved impressionist art here in my homeland, and would b very glad to share it with locals as well as tourists. I hope such exhibitions would recur for more viewing opportunities."
,,Best place to learn Singapore‚Äôs history,5.0,,"Very enjoyable and extremely well presented museum on the history of Singapore, through great exhibits and well documented sets that take you from the early days to modern Singapore. Really worth the visit."
,,Great place,5.0,,Great place to hang out with friends. If you want to find out history of Singapore this is must go place. I simply loved it.
,,Great musuem,5.0,,"Housed in a magnificent building this musuem is the place to go to learn about Singapore, it's history and it's people. Volunteer guides provide a good tour of the musuem adding to the overall experience. A great day out and a good cafe in the museum is a good place to enjoy lunch."
,,Second time here for Teamlab and restaurant,4.0,,"My second time here, overall experience and staffs are nice. So this time I especially visit there for Teamlab at the glass rotunda which is interesting and creative. Easy access with discount for student and senior. Event and exhibition may changes periodly. Cafe and restaurants there also interesting (michelin starred restaurant, famous restaurant included) and can be visit without museum ticket."
,,A Palace of Culture,5.0,,A huge building with an impressive collection of artefacts. The rooftop restaurant has terrific views.
,,A Great Museum,5.0,,"We spent hours at t his museum. The first floor covered the history of Singapore up until modern times. The second floor had q photography exhibit from around the world showing many of the problems. It was riveting.
Also starting on the second floor was a graphic display of the history of a forest. It was artistically beautiful with music. You go through it on a pathway that circles around the room gradually taking you lower, It was very worthwhile and child friendly."
,,What an amazing museum!,5.0,,"As the weather was not looking too promising we decided to forego another visit to the Botanic Gardens and go to the National Museum. Dare I say I was glad the weather was uncertain? This museum is really worth a visit, rain or shine!
The displays are very well set out and the information boards are clear and interesting to read. The history of Singapore is far more complex than I thought and so it was also a very educational trip. We didn't coincide with the guided tours which are currently held at 11.00 and 14.00 but this meant we could wander round at our own pace. It took us over three hours! An excellent introduction into the varied past which has made Singapore what it is today."
,,Great place start when visiting Singapore,5.0,,"The museum was well-laid out and the exhibitions were easy to follow. I'd recommend this place to anyone that wants to learn about how Singapore came to be. I spent about 3 hours, but one can easily spend less or more time there."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,A great place to go on a rainy afternoon. Highly recommend especially if you have kids or teens.........
,,"Beautiful building, great history",5.0,,This is a beautiful building set out in such a way that you can follow the history of Singapore through the ages. Highly recommended if you are a history buff
,,Beautiful Museum,5.0,,"The museum has several different exhibits which are all unique and worth seeing. I would highly recommend going on the guided tour, it was incredibly informative and interesting. I learned a bulk of history in a couple of hours! The building itself is historic (Raffles library) and beautiful, with a very modern addition. I would highly recommend!"
,,Great Historical Window Into Old Singapore,4.0,,"I was born in Singapore in 1958, the son of a British Royal Airforce Engineer. I went to school here until I was 11. It was a very different place then and I loved it. Back in Europe I never forgot it or stopped longing for it. Although I am proud of what Singapore has achieved and that it is a more modern and successful place now, I miss the old kampong-style city. This museum brought the old Singapore back to me for a day. I am very grateful and will come back next time I visit the city."
,,Excellent all round,5.0,,"The National Museum Of Singapore is a must see place for all visitors to Singapore.

The museum is housed in a beautiful building - and reminds you of the colonial splendor of British architecture.. It is the oldest museum in Singapore and dates back to 1887.

It is open daily from 10am to 7pm - and the last admission is at 6.15pm. I enjoyed the Story of the Forest. It was a clever technological display that has to be seen to be believed - as it transforms drawings into 3D animation.

There are other exhibitions about Singapore's past - the Japanese occupation was interesting.

Every last Saturday of the month - there are ""family time"" activities.

I spent half a day in this museum - and still felt that i could go round again.

Admission is free to Singapore citizens and permanent residents."
,,History personified.,5.0,,"Magnificent building, so much to see and do, please do not miss this one, absolutely brilliant. The architecture itself is well worth the visit, the history, particularly the history of the war years we found most interesting."
,,Hard to reach and not worth the admission,2.0,,"Closest MRT station is Bras Basah but it's not exactly next to the museum, which is located near Fort Canning park. Exhibits were not that interesting, admission was kind of pricey. Would not visit again."
,,"Beautiful, inside and out",3.0,,"Beautiful building, lovingly created from British Colonial court. The art on display is pretty eclectic, but little of the modern rubbish. Also quite close to the Asian Civilization Museum, which is well worth a visit as well."
,,Great collection of artwork in a stunning space,5.0,,"The museum is an impressive building housing a great collection of artwork. It is a great place to understand Singapore's history, as well as experiencing modern works. My favourite areas were ""Art of the Rehearsal"", an immersive video installation that has dancers perform across a panoramic view, and ""Story of the Forest"" which is a digital presentation, that can only be described as magical - at floor level, take the time to lie facing up and watch as you are transported elsewhere. Recommended for any culture lover."
,,Special Event 20 April to 30 Sept 2018 The More we Get together ( SIngapore Playgrounds 1930-2030),4.0,,"Actually, we have planned to visit this Special Event which talk about Singapore Playground History.

,,Great for understanding the history of Singapore.,5.0,,"I traveled with my sister to Singapore, the museum was our first stop because we wanted to know a bit more about the history of Singapore and this museum really helped. It's spacious, informative and interesting. There are some amazing animated displays that you lie back on beanbags to enjoy.
The Banyan tree outside the museum was probably the highlight of my visit, I've never seen one before and was fascinated by it.
There is a cafe inside the museum and the food was very good."
,,History of Singapore,4.0,,It's always good to know the history of a country when visiting their countries. The museum itself is very well located and we loved the area. The museum is very spacious and great technologies to introduce us the history of Singapore. Singapore did a great job preserving the original form of the architecture. Great sunlight entering through the glass windows.
,,Fantastic museum,5.0,,"Wonderful few hours in here with a great guided tour, passionate about Singapore. Really informative displays on a variety of aspects of the history of Singapore. Really brought it's modern history to life."
,,Very good,5.0,,was a very good time spend at the museum as its a good layout and now i know beter of the history of singapore worth the visit
,,Excellent museum,5.0,,"We had a guided tour to start with, at 11am, this was very informative and very interesting, about the origins and history of Singapore. Lunch was very nice there. The planetarium is a must see with (digital) flowers falling down the walls (you are on a bridge to start) and then you walk down the walkway to the lower level (and on the left hand side it has a projection of a forest turning from day into night) this is just incredible, and then you end up on the lower level watching the flowers again falling from the ceiling down the walls and seemingly the flowers and forest are all around you - just delightful. A great day out, a small fee to get in but well worth it."
,,Its good to see the progress,4.0,,"I enjoyed an extremely good tour at 11am by a very well informed volunteer guide on Sep 20 ( sorry i cannot recall her name) . It was great to see the early Singapore and the great advances that have been made today.

If only i could drag every Australian MP through it so they see what can be done when the politicians pull their fingers out!!"
,,make the time to visit!,4.0,,"It is the oldest museum [in a beautiful building] and a cultural landmark telling the story of Singapore to the world. It is divided into three levels-Level One-the Singapore History Gallery, Level 2- Life in Singapore over the past 100 years [very interesting] dealing with the Modern Colony, the Japanese occupation and the Growing up Gallery-echoing the sentiments of a generation. Level 3-activity space. There is a gift shop and three eating venues-Food for Thought-adjacent to the gift shop-good for coffee and a quick snack. There is also Flutes and Janice Wong Singapore-the latter showcasing chocolates for dining as well as retail. Make the time for this-easily accessible via the MRT [subway line]"
,,"Pleasant building, but...",2.0,,"The best historical exhibition in Singapore is the Art Gallery (in the refurbished Court House, overlooking the historical Cricket ground). Great collection, wonderful architecture. The second best is the Asian Civilizations Museum, just down the road from it. The National Museum is a distant third. The main display is pedestrian, while the digital display (Rain forest) is childish, and I don't mean that as a compliment. Even the inept ArtSceince Museum is moderately engaging by comparison. Unless you have may days to spare, or are looking for a wedding shoot location, I would put this place well down the list."
,,Beautiful museum.,5.0,,Beautifully curated museum. Not too big but still full of great history. Easy to move through. Good snap shot of Dingapore.
,,Interesting museum to fill in time,4.0,,"This museum is set in a beautiful building. It is very different to normal national museums, having very few artifacts to see.
It was more a story of the last 200 yrs ( very little information about the island‚Äôs history before the English arrived. )
The special exhibition re flowers and the forest was rather strange.
The guide who did the 2 pm English tour yesto(?Michelle) was wonderful.
Entry was discounted for seniors at $10.
If you are short of time in Singapore give this museum a miss."
,,A must visit.,5.0,,Very interesting way to spend a few hours. Very well laid out and incredibly informative about Singapore history. Extremely clean and really nice friendly staff. Very nice coffee shop too.
,,Blown away,5.0,,"This museum was excellently curated. It painted an engaging and comprehensive portrait of Singapore's history, from its roots as a trade economy, to its history as a British colony, to an independent nation. The information was easy to follow, and the exhibits were varied and interesting. Particularly touching was a section about the Japanese occupation and a film documenting Lee Kuan Yew's speech regarding Singapore's separation from Malaysia. I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to Singaporean history!"
,,Interesting,4.0,,Well set out and informative. I learned a lot about the history of Singapore. Lovely and air conditioned when it's hot outside. Beautiful building
,,worthwhile cultural stop,5.0,,"We like this- its a well designed museum, easy to consume, good Singapore history. Well cone commentary"
,,Just amazing,5.0,,A great spot to get out of the heat and soak up the history of the Singapore history and how this civilisation came to be. Well worth a visit. Not for small children.
,,A good day off,3.0,,"Its a great place to have a day off the busy city life and slow down to enjoy the various exhibits. These changes from time to time and when I was there, it had several gallery showing the history of Singapore through the 19 - 20 century. It was pretty interesting."
,,Great view of the history of this incredible Island state,5.0,,I visited this museum as many other art museums were either closed for renovation or closed for good. I found the exhibitions of the history of Singapore very interesting to learn how much Singapore has advanced since formation .
,,Bloody ripper!,5.0,,"I don‚Äôt write many reviews but this place is an absolute highlight for the history enjoying wine drinking, food enjoyer! Sensational! Don‚Äôt miss, tour is terrific and Flutes restaurant is absobloodylutely fantastic! House wines to die for at the price (particularly the Prosecco). Chilli crab pasta excellent. Not a budget buster either. Team members are excellent too! Is that a rave review, is it what!"
,,Very enjoyable visit,5.0,,We very much enjoyed our visit to this museum. It is located in a beautifully renovated building. The exhibits are quite diverse and interesting. A mix of Asian and European art. Friendly staff are available to answer all questions and offer advice.
,,Excellent Museum & All Encompassing,5.0,,Surprised to see this is not ranked higher on the top things to do list in Singapore. Thought the museum was excellent as it took you from ancient to modern times of life in Singapore and the Straits Settlements.
,,A surprising favorite,4.0,,"This was my favorite activity during our one day stay in Singapore. It was fascinating to learn the history of the country. There is a good mix of things to look at, videos to watch, recordings to listen to, and signs to read. However, there not less detail about the years after the country was established, which I would have been interested in learning about. The cafe there is wonderful."
,,Lovely museum,5.0,,"We were too early to go for the Battlebox tour so having reserved for 1.30 ,came here to pass a few hours, and so glad we did. The space is beautiful and it‚Äôs a really good presentation of the history of Singapore. We had lunch on the terrace and wished we had had more time for the restaurant. A very relaxing morning."
,,Visitors Not Welcome after 6:00,1.0,,"I went to visit the museum and arrived at 6:05. I was informed that after 6:00, only Singapore residents are allowed in (for free). I graciously offered to pay, but they hid behind policy and refused to let me in. Open until 7:00???"
,,Good presentation of the history of Singapore,5.0,,"One highlight of this Museum is a corkscrew walk downwards with murals on the wall depicting the animals and plants which would have been found in Singapore before it became so populated. This would be very popular with children. There was an interesting photography display in the Museum showing people who had accidentally become part of photographs of famous events, even though they themselves were not the principal characters of the event. I found this concept very interesting."
,,Meaningfull,4.0,,"This museum is very attractive. Staffs are polite. We love to explore however not too much areas/ information, just need around 2 hours to visit."
,,First-rate,5.0,,"Geared towards both adults and children, this museum is well done. It is located in a beautiful building at a convenient location near MRT stations. There is a nice variety of exhibits. They should provide benches for weary tourists."
,,So glad we didn‚Äôt miss this,5.0,,"We didn‚Äôt have time to do this museum justice but we really enjoyed seeing the very well curated history of Singapore gallery. I think it‚Äôs an essential part of a visit to Singapore. A bit pricey, especially the restaurant."
,,A must vist,5.0,,"the well kept colonial styled building houses a museum. Even strolling its surrounding in the evening, offers a tranquil refuge from yhe busy city"
,,A lot of new knowledge,5.0,,I did not know a lot about the history of Singapore over the last 100 years but after visiting the museum I am overflowing with knowledge. The integration of a lot of technology into the museum means it is very up to date and more enjoyable for some younger visitors too.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The story of the forest is a fantastic installation, comprising of 69 animations shown over three levels in the rotunda, we went for the history of Singapore but this was a very pleasant addition. The local history is really well displayed broken up into four different galleries. A very busy museum but plenty of amenities for everyone. If you want to walk through Fort Canning exit on level three rather than try to negotiate it from the front of the museum."
,,Digital,5.0,,Had a good time seeing how the conventional media can be given a new lease of life by integrating it with digital media. Made it more interesting and meaningful.
,,Top Museum with Two Standout Galleries,5.0,,"This really is a great museum. Cleverly laid out with well presented exhibits. Contrary to some other peoples comments most of it is actually not free (unless you happen to be Singaporean) but costs S$15. As a result of the need to pay the ticket desk is a bottle neck. There will be queues most afternoons to get in.

If you're pushed for time, and I realise what follows is subjective, there were two standout galleries for me. Start by going up the escalator and into the ""Story of the Forest"" exhibit. Nothing to do with Singapore it's a moving light show that feels like you're walking through a kids picture book. Really well done. And you eventually end up at the start of...

...The story of Singapore Gallery. The main purpose of the museum this takes you through Singapore's history in multi-media exhibits that you can spend as long or as short a time with depending on how much detail you're after.

Finally, as an alternative to the pricey museum cafe, the university just over the street has a couple of excellent food courts. I'd particularly recommend ""The Tea Party Express"" at street level for dirt cheap, alfresco pasta dishes in a box often with a free drink."
,,Worth a Visit,5.0,,"We spent over half a day at this museum, it is well worth a visit. We took the train to the National Museum and it was an easy 300-400m walk to the museum, easy to find. Lovely old building. Has a coffee shop inside. Afterwards you can walk down to Orchard Rd which isn't a long walk or go to Orchard Rd on the train, only a couple of stops. If you like museums this place is worth a visit."
,,Beautiful Architecture,5.0,,"One should visit this place , Entry fee is 15$ and it's amazing place . Minimum time required is 3-4 hours to visit entire place at one go ."
,,Not that much to see but the cafe is worth a visit,3.0,,"Museum is ok but the cafe and staff are worth a visit. Good food and snacks, the scrambled eggs are lovely."
,,Informative and well-laid our,5.0,,"Highly informative and an engaging layout to learn about every period of Singapore history. We did the docent English tour and found that it made the experience much richer, so try to align your visit with one of their tour times. There are some interesting exhibits on the upper floors as well. The building‚Äôs architecture is also pleasing to view."
,,ok if you are a history buff,3.0,,We spent two hours here on their independence day. The World War 2 exhibition was very good but some parts of the place were closed off.
,,Back to the National Museum,4.0,,We returned to the National Museum recently for another visit. Being free for citizens and PRs it makes for a useful attraction on rainy days. The kids are usually quite happy to wander through the exhibits for an hour or so.
,,What a surprise this was,5.0,,"The Museum was very well presented and follows the photographic history, war and urban development throughout the decades. We were able to visually see the changes we vaguely remembered over our trips to Singapore 24 years ago, 12 years ago and now. The 360 degree electronical optical display on the way out was great,"
,,Singapore History,4.0,,"Visiting the National Museum if you intend to know more about Singapore.
If you want to make your trip in Singapore more interesting, you may visit the museum first then along your tour try to look out for the monument that bear historical memory.
Go in the afternoon to enjoy the air con if the weather is unbearable.
Charges applied and do check their website."
,,First-class experience,5.0,,Great interactive displays that provide historical context. There is something of interest for all ages.
,,very interesting,5.0,,Excellent explanation of complete history of Singapore with easy to read captions on all exhibits. Good cafe
,,Great collection of local and overseas artifacts and things of interest,4.0,,A great venue for viewing of local and overseas artifacts and loc fauna and flora. Grand old building that was beautifully restored.
,,Understanding history at a place shortly,4.0,,"The best place to understand Singapore history shortly

Singapore may have tough history recently due to colonial periods from several countries such as UK, Japan

Thanks to leadership, the country has achieved drastic advancement.

,,Very Educational,5.0,,"This museum is one of the few museums I enjoy visiting. Not only the exhibitions (both permanent and temporary) organized very well but also provided educational-purpose to the visitors. I would recommend first time traveler to the Singapore making this museum a must-go. Also, don‚Äôt forget to download the ‚ÄúNational Museum of Singapore‚Äù from the App Store. The app offers translation in different languages for the foreigners who does not speak English as their main language. Very useful and the app is free to download."
,,For history buffs,3.0,,This museum has some excellent exhibits detailing the historical and cultural development of Singapore. If that's what you're into you will enjoy this museum. For our money the Asian Civilizations Museum was a much preferable experience.
,,Interesting history and beautiful building,5.0,,"We thought that this was a very good museum. An excellent way to obtain a good summary history of Singapore. The exhibits are interesting and provide a balanced view of what has sometimes been a turbulent past. The upstairs galleries provide good example and insight to more recent history.

The building itself is beautiful.

Overall, a good museum, worth the entry fee and a good start to anyone visiting Singapore for the first time."
,,National Museum,4.0,,"Very nice museum with some great displays and artefacts. Lovely cafe in the centre, with a nice ambience"
,,National Museum of Singapore,4.0,,Good display of history of Singapore.. Free entry for Singaporean... Nice visit for kids to learn about Singapore and nice for the Seniors to recall the good old days.... Worth a go for the weekend... and worth a trip for those first time to Singapore.
,,Nice museum,4.0,,If you are interested in history this is the place to visit. The history of Singapore is shown in a way that it is also interesting for children.
,,very informative,4.0,,this is a great place to get a bit of an insight into the history of Singapore take a jumper though as the air-conditioning is rather aggressive
,,Brilliantly laid out museum,5.0,,We thoroughly enjoyed spending a morning at the national museum. It was cleverly laid out with lots of signage. The light exhibition (June 2018) was spectacular.
,,Interesting,5.0,,It is a nice interesting building and a fun place to explore. Seems to have more stuff about Singapores development and recent history rather than cabinets full of artifacts. A taxi driver told me if I wanted to look at cabinets full of artifacts I should go to the Asian Civilisations museum.
,,Very Interesting,5.0,,"Very interesting museum, with nicely done exhibits. You will learn a lot about the history of Singapore as you walk through the museum. Free tours are provided at 11AM. I would do the 1st floor first and then go upstars."
,,Great Customer Service,3.0,,If you get the opportunity go on the free guided tour. A great way to learn about the history of Singapore.
,,Interesting,3.0,,"This is a highly rated attraction and relatively new. I wonder why many modern museums are so gloomy which among other things makes it difficult to read the explanations of the exhibits, It certainly provides plenty of information about the history of Singapore so would be a good starting point for the first time visitor."
,,Get to know Singapore's history,5.0,,"One of the most interactive museums I have been to. Get to know all about Singapore's history through the colonial, Japanese and Chinese rule, wars and emerging as an independent and progressive nation. The first floor galleries with the flower stories are a must visit."
,,National Museum is Must See in Singapore,5.0,,"Very interesting Museum, showing the History of Singapore, Colonial History, and how Singapore survived the Japanese occupation. In particular the Glass Rotunda and its digital presentation is an absolute must."
,,"Not cheap, but worth it",4.0,,"At S$15 admission ticket for non-citizens, it is quite steep but worth the visit. Everything was labelled with detailed description. The timeline can get confusing as there's no clear path provided especially at the beginning of the history exhibition (but it does get more linear by the mid section). Very informative, the gems that I found are the 'Malay for Mems' book on display and the 'Stop at two' policy by the Singaporean government to control the population."
,,Unique museum experience,5.0,,I spent a lovely afternoon at this history museum. Be sure to take one of the complimentary guided tours. The tour lasted an hour and the guide was knowledgeable and interesting. After the tour I explored on my own. The museum is easy to navigate. There is a restaurant and gift shop within the building.
,,A very easy museum to navigate and learn,5.0,,"I went to this on my first full day in Singapore. What a treasure. A very easy way to learn about the area you are visiting. It flows through the years so easily the way it is layed out. For $10 or $15, a great half of a day. Lots for little ones when I was there also."
,,Playground,4.0,,They currently have an exhibition on children‚Äôs playground. Very nostalgic. A reminder of how playgrounds used to be in the past.
,,Informative and Educational,5.0,,"The museum houses several exhibitions depicting the history of Singapore spanning over 100 years. The exhibitions includes history of times when Singapore was part of Malaysia and just a fishing village, arrival of British traders, evolution of Singapore as a strategic trade hub, Japanese occupation, struggle for independence and the modern times when Singapore gained its own identity. Some exhibits also includes details of how different cultures such as Indian and Chinese flourished in the city. The exhibits and visuals will certainly take you back in time and you will not just know but experience the history of Singapore.

Besides the history of Singapore there was also a very interesting exhibition about old trees in Singapore (not sure if that was a permanent exhibition). Also there is a digital art installation titled ""Story of The Forest"". One can notice glimpse of the Singapore Zoo, Garden by the Bay and Botanical Gardens (or it could just be me). And lastly there is Wings of Maneuvre which is kinetic chandeliers which sway in some rhythm.

This is the best place not just to know but experience the history of Singapore. A must visit place in Singapore. It is recommended to get the museum app on your phone to get more updated information."
,,Singapore History Gallery worth visiting,5.0,,"We like visiting museums when we travel and, accordingly, we visited the National Museum of Singapore on our trip to the country. Upon arriving at the museum, we decided to view the exhibit called the ""Singapore History Gallery."" We entered the exhibit and were introduced to the history of Singapore, commencing in detail around the 14th century. We then moved into another room, and then another, and then another, and so on. We did not expect the exhibit to be so elaborate and detailed. The exhibit is so enthralling that we spent 2-3 hours in it, slowly and enjoyably learning as we made our way through the history of the country to rooms ultimately featuring information and objects pertaining to contemporary Singapore. It came as a pleasant surprise to us as we gradually realized that we were experiencing an exhibit that is among the best that we have visited. The curators of the exhibit earned our admiration for the skill with which it was designed and carried out."
,,Beautiful building with excellent history of Singapore,5.0,,"The museum is separated into many different zones to showcase different eras of Singapore's fascinating history. A mix of old and modern, it contains many mini-stories that you need to understand before you can appreciate the Singapore that has developed today."

,,Worth a trip for some history & culture,5.0,,"We started our trip in Singapore with a visit to the Museum, always find it gives a greater understanding and appreciation of the place.

,,Very Educational,5.0,,"We've been discussing if we will go here or not, glad we went here. I love everything in here. It's like I travel back in time. I specifically like dome. They have different activities coming soon. Hope to be back here again. I can say it's worth the price, i love educational museums. Be here in the morning to avoid the crowd."
,,Incredible Museum!,5.0,,Such an incredible museum full of great exhibits. Each display is complete with headsets for additional details. The Story of the Forest exhibit in the dome is one of the most incredible exhibits I've ever seen. My 7-year-old and I felt like we were in a dream. We will definitely be back!
,,Good Presentation,4.0,,Collection was small but they present it very well by focusing on story telling. I learned a lot about the history of Singapore. Worth the price if you are interested in history.

The museum displays many of Singapore cultures and history before its success becoming a global power.

There are some wonderful displays for kids, but for adults there is plenty, and a very well illustrated history of Singapore. I strongly recommend this, along with the very good cafe/restaurant on site.

Also, the admission is reasonably priced too. Great value for money."
,,Comprehensive History of Singapore,4.0,,A great place for the family to spend the afternoon. This museum has a good and comprehensive collection on the history of Singapore. It traces the beginnings from 14th Century to modern Singapore. The exhibits are engaging even for children. Guided tours are offered at stipulated timings. I would recommend all visitors to Singapore to visit this Museum.

,,"Enjoyed the quiet, contemplative space in this museum",4.0,,"Going to Museum can be a solitary activity. Took this opportunity to learn to do thing solo. Enjoyed the quiet, contemplative space in this museum which also provide inspiration.

After the free and good 1-hr guided tour in National Museum of Singapore, re-telling the history of Singapore, I‚Äôm grateful to be living in a place and era, to many millions of people is a heaven on earth."
,,Interesting displays of life in Singspore,4.0,,"Two floors of exhibits, some a little cluttered, printing on photos and exhibits too small, enjoyed afternoon tea and the shop had good quality souveniers"
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"Reflects a lot of Singapore and SE Asian history and has some great artwork and cultural displays. We would suggest better signage to guide tourists , but staff were helpful."
,,Good experience,4.0,,Efficient from buying a ticket to exit. The museum is very informative and tells the story of Singapore in detail. You can easily spend 2 or more hours there. I also visited the art exhibition and find that great with visitors voting for the best piece of art. Thumbs up for Singaporeans for what they have achieved in a short period of time.

,,Informative and Interesting,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit if you want to learn a little more about Singapore. The dome exhibit is absolutely stunning, and simply breathtaking. We spent about three and a half hours here, and it is definitely worth it. The building itself is also very beautiful, and worth seeing."

,,Fantastic surprise! New multi-media show FORESTS show is stunning.,5.0,,"We'd heard this is a good museum and we were delighted with what we discovered. The FORESTS multi-media show is just stunning. Special exhibit on the History of Women in Singapore is worth the time, too. Lots to discover. We spent 3-4 hours and we wish we'd had more time."
,,will not visit again,2.0,,I did not like much even my 5 year old son also bored. Not easy access. I would prefer to go science center then this.
,,Cool Exhibits,5.0,,Loved the infrastructure of the museum and loved the fascinating exhibits more. There's good food at the museum too!
,,Worth your time to visit!,5.0,,"My daughter and I enjoyed this museum immensely. I have a basic working knowledge of the history of this important island nation now. Stories and relics from Singapore's beginnings as a trading center through its period of English colonization, on to its occupation by the Japanese in WW II, its subsequent liberation and independence. Singapore is unique in many ways!"
,,"Great museum, great motivation",5.0,,"it's quite unbelievable that a small island country without long historical narrative stories backing up as Singapore will be able to have the great interesting museum.

this national museum has some unique characteristic and it's so powerful to present the Singaporean historical stories in another specific aspect to make Singaporean to proud of their multi-cultural nation collaboration.

almost of the galleries has planned perfectly and well organized with a lot of interactive learning supporting media.

from my personal, I have the most favorite gallery that's so impressive, there has mentioned about the lover who had survived and painful suffering living during Japanese occupation period,

I couldn't remember exactly narrative wording from a video, but roughly ""..it's quite difficult to understand how can the people still loved during the brutality uncertain consequence like that, but on the other hand the people might asked during the brutality uncertain circumstance like that how can we live without love...""

this is the right place to get comprehensive understanding about Singapore, and learn the dynamical key to build up the prosperity country.

there is no doubt, this is absolutely worth for visiting place."
,,If you are at all interested in the city's history and culture this is a must-see,5.0,,"My wife and I were advised to visit this museum by numerous friends and it did not disappoint. The History of Singapore section is incredible, beginning with a large wall-projected ancient map, and ending with the modern day. However the real highlight was Story of the Forest in the Rotunda. Amazing. If you are in Singapore, this is a must."
,,Very good,4.0,,I really enjoyed the history of Singapore with all the exhibits. It‚Äôs air conditioned too so gives a welcome respite from the humidity and heat. The cafe is lovely too.
,,‚ÄúWonderful Museum‚Äù,5.0,,"As a Malaysian and working Singapore, I envy both of the country, the ties between this two brotherhood and I love history soo muchh. This is just the right place for it to understand the the history of this two big brothers.

The Museum permenant exhibition from Temasik, Clown Colony to Syonan To, In Malaysia for 2 years and finally became Independant just so warming to follow the trail of it.

Its going to cost you a full day if you are really wants to understand the history. Building is well preserved. Great experience!!"
,,decent enough museum,4.0,,"Loved the 4 rooms depicting the history of Singapore around the time of the second world war, the occuplation, and the aftermath. Very interesting. We were in a rush, and missed out visiting the glass rotunda. Nice exhibits, displayed well, easy to follow"

Take a few tour to get an overview. Fabulous displays and lots of cool technology for an amazing interactive experience."
,,Create something out of nothing,5.0,,"For me as a middle eastern guy anything which isn't more than 500 years old is brand new, so you can guess what I thought of singapore that is much newer than that, but to be honest, the museum managed to present its brief history in a very informative elegant way that deserves a stand and applause. History is not much, but embrace what you have."
,,Important Insight,4.0,,Well woth the walk to visit this hidden gem. It gives an insight into this amazing nation and it smiling people
,,Every time is a surprise,5.0,,"As a Singaporean, I've visited this National Museum countless times.
Every visit is a surprise. Something is new, some thing changed.

I have to say the management took a lot of continuous effort to ensure that the displays are not stationary and the setup always look interesting.

A place worth visiting and revisiting."
,,One of the best museum i've ever visit,5.0,,"There's lot of explanation about Singapore, such as video about Lee Kuan Yeew speech when Singapore was separate from Malaysia and lot of history item there like in the picture below"
,,Historical design building,5.0,,"Interesting, good explanatory captions, they had booklets with translations. Worth a visit to get a potted summary of this interesting nation! A place to escape the hot weather."
,,Classy Museum,5.0,,"Visited today..Paid Entry Fee of 10 Singapore Dollars being Senior Citizen...Well Connected by Bus...Housed in a large, Spacious Colonial Building..Has complete history of Singapore in many sections..Very well organised & clean.. Fully Air-conditioned..I liked the section covering Growth of Singapore Women, Singapore during World War II, Singapore's Economic Growth since the War.. Would love to visit again.."
,,"Historical design building, Back to the future",4.0,,"As a Malaysian aka Johorian, who always watch Singapore TV and read a lot of stuff, 95% of the Singapore history already in my mind. Probably it is a good attraction and insight for Non-Malaysian/ Non-Johorian, which need to pay for the ticket. Historical building, good for taking photo, especially couples. For those who love to dive into one country's timeline, it would be a good jump start here."
,,another level of information,5.0,,"After all the greenery in the jungles, beaches, shopping frenzy and luxury feelings at Orchard, hit the museum to learn more and go a bit deeper what it means to be a Singaporean or to live in Singapore. Done in a user and child friendly manner, it is not boring or exhausting, yet those who like can spend the whole day here, reading and reading all the notes and information. Shall I mention the very efficient air-conditioning? Really a nice soothing break from it all...."
,,Stunning building and different museum,4.0,,The very modern 3D display on the upper levels was quite different however the lower level provided excellent displays of the history of Singapore from both a personal and political aspect.
,,Great insight into Singapore History,4.0,,"Interesting, good explanatory captions -although only in English, they had booklets with translations. Worth a visit to get a potted summary of this interesting nation! We spent just over 2 hrs here."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Take the time to visit this wonderful museum. In true Singaporean style everything is just beautifully set out. Amazing
,,Best Museum,5.0,,"This is a great place to learn more about the history and the beginnings of Singapore. Admission fee is SGD 15.00, a little steep if you don't really have a budget but it is worth-it. Explore the whole building and it would take you about 2-3 hours to finish all galleries and exhibitions. A great place for museum freaks like me. I highly recommend this place."
,,Inaccurate account of Japanese occupation,2.0,,"I was very disappointed in the exhibition covering the history of Singapore - in particular the section covering the Japanese occupation during WWII.
The exhibition gives the impression that life under Japanese rule wasn‚Äôt too bad as long as you followed the rules and got the right permits. There is no mention of Sook Ching which was the systematic killing of members of the Chinese population. Officially Japan claims that fewer than 5,000 deaths occurred, while Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first prime minister, said ""verifiable numbers would be about 70,000"". In 1966 Japan agreed to pay S$50 million in compensation, half of which was a grant and the rest as a loan. They did not make an official apology.
I do not understand how this could not be mentioned in the exhibition or is it that the museum authorities do not wish to offend anyone. Whitewashing history is wrong."
,,It is air conditioned.,3.0,,A couple of hours respite from the heat. Cost us $15 each to enter. Interesting presentation of Singapore's development. Learnt some new things. Close to Bencoolen mrt. If you are into history and need some relief from the heat then you will enjoy it more than me. Not really my thing. I should have gone to bugis to shop!
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"Excellent museum. The history of Singapore told in an engaging and stimulating manner. Really enjoyed the divided up segments (Colonial, Japanese occupation period, etc) and gorgeous building. Worth a stop."
,,Get much knowledge!,5.0,,You can study how Singaporeans strived for to become a great country. The exhibitions are great and attractive. You should spend more than 1 hr to visit this museum.
,,A must visit!,5.0,,I learned so much about Singapore's history and got a better understanding of the makeup of the country. If you want to learn about Singapore's history...please visit.
,,‚ÄòSingapore a history‚Äô through artefacts and effective delivery,4.0,,"Great insights, leaving us well versed in the history of Singapore and an understanding of the people. Certainly up to the standard of equivalent in global cities. Worth the efforts and cost."
,,Amazing Exhibitions,5.0,,"The newly renovated National Museum of Singapore is truly iconic. It has a lot of really nice exhibitions, so if you are an art or history lover you'll really enjoy spending a few hours here."
,,Very Good,5.0,,We visited the museum on our last morning in Singapore and were happy we did. We were lucky enough to arrive just as a free tour was happening ( 11am ) that was taken by a volunteer of the museum. She gave us a great insight and explained the very good displays' Worth a visit.
,,Go there!,5.0,,Need a few hours to see it all. Very fascinating and they have everything you could ever wish a museum to have. Thoroughly enjoyed our time wandering around. Will make sure we go there again to check out everything again.
,,"Educational and fascinating, as always",5.0,,"Excellent, well-organised exhibits, with clear information on the history of Singapore! Lots of interesting stories from locals that accompany the exhibits. Impressive architecture - integrating both old and new. This visit was my third visit, and I am still so intrigued by how wonderful this museum is. Highly recommended!"
,,interesting,5.0,,worth a visiti - great history of the making of Singapore in a beautiful building - only $15 to enter
,,TARDIS destination singapore,4.0,,This museum provides excellent history about Singapore and what happened. It has great artifacts on display whilst also telling stories of the past in the most creative ways. Definitely worth visiting at least once because there is a lot to learn.
,,Well worth a visit.,5.0,,"Beautiful architecture housing a plethora of interesting displays, particularly an exhibition of the development of play parks over the decades."
,,A great & interesting museum.,5.0,,Amazingly spent 4 hours here. It went from the concept of Singapura from the start. An extremely good section with reference to the Japanese invasion. The museum is well laid out and I would certainly recommend a visit.
,,So Good We Visited Twice,5.0,,"This museum is part very old and part hyper modern, but it's all well maintained and efficient. There are excellent lockers available to store backpacks and hats (and strollers). We hit the last day of a special exhibit on Singapore During World War II, which was very, very well done. An unadvertized attraction is a glass atrium that's actually a showplace for stunning computer generated images. We had to visit twice to ensure we had enough photographs to show friends. There's an excellent ""museum store"" and a a friendly snack bar (plus a very nice linen tablecloth restaurant if you are interested)."
,,Not outstanding in any way,3.0,,"Went here to spend a rainy afternoon whilst on holiday in Singapore. It was ok. Not very well laid out and was told we must start upstairs, so we did and then ended up back on the lower floor totally confused! There is a lot on display but we didnt learn very much about Singapore. Loads of children there but personally I wouldnt recommend as I would think they would be bored, not enough interactive exhibits or much in the way of excitement. Spent a couple of hours strolling around but only go if you have spare time, I certainly wouldnt say its a 'must see'."
,,Great history lesson,4.0,,"This beautiful building houses a nice exhibit of Singaporean history, nicely illustrated and laid out, easy to walk through. An interactive way to learn more about Singapore that I can highly recommend for people interested in history and museums."
,,Good for History!,4.0,,We did this to get a bit of an insight into the history of Singapore and I'm glad we did. Small enough to not wear you out but large enough to learn a lot about this lovely little country with a big history.
,,Awesome place to visit when it's raining or when it's toooo hot outside haha,5.0,,"Embarrassed to say that this is the 1st time I've visited our national museum even thou I'm a citizen here. Therefore, didn't expect to spend that long a time to tour around the place.

Started with a tour of the Singapore history section (free admission for citizens but tourist has to pay a fee for entry) and spent 2.5hours here. Unfortunately, they were closing soon, so had to rush a few parts. As a citizen here, it was very informative, engaging and has some beautiful places to take a few pictures with/of (thou, as per norm, no flash allowed).

Currently, they are holding ""The More We Get Together: Singapore's Playgrounds 1930 ‚Äì 2030"" exhibition showcasing the experience of growing up in Singapore, which ends on September 2018. Admission is free for all (citizens/tourists), so come along while you're here or if you wish to get away from the heat!"
,,Great place especially if raining,5.0,,"I am no museum buff but what a great place to visit.....it tells the story of Singapore in such an interactive way on the ground floor then upstairs it marks the progress over time that we all recall whatever our country.....it taught me whatever your country, you play with the same toys ,listen to the same music and watch much of the same TV....brillant. You will need at least 2-3hrs probably come back another day......enjoy"
,,Great place to learn about singapore,5.0,,Have worked and lived in singapore a lot over the last 30 years and even singapore has only been around as a country for 50 years but this museum taught me a lot about singapore welll worth going
,,"If you want to know more about Singapore, go to this place.",5.0,,"Visiting museums is always part of my itinerary, that's why I made it a point to visit National Museum of Singapore on my first day there. There's a $15 SGD entrance fee here but on the day I visited, the place is open to the public for free so I didn't need to pay for anything. I learned a lot during my visit here, especially the pre-colonial era of Singapore and the post-colonial state of the country. It was fun seeing history come to life in this place. There were also other attractions in this place - during the time of my visit, an installation by a French artist was in display."
,,"Interesting, informative",5.0,,"My husband spent nearly 5 hours here soaking in the exhibits, going on the tour, and learning about the history of Singapore. He was fascinated, delighted, and highly recommends. Why didn‚Äôt I go? Had to work. :("
,,Interesting Museum,4.0,,"Very nice and clean musuem. When I visited there was not many people so I get to study those exhibitions in detail without having many people around. The cafe was great, a good place to chill out in the afternoon.

My children loved the drive-in car theater exhibition."
,,Well maintained museum,5.0,,"first of all the building itself looks good and so is the environment around it.

The interactivity and presentation of the exhibit keeps us entertained especially in the singapore history exhibit in the first floor.

The TeamLab's exhibit is also quite interesting to see and we can sit and rest a bit"
,,Pleasant visit to nice Miseum,4.0,,Very nice and peaceful visit to the National Museum. It is well laid out and covers several ages of the island. I found the history very interesting and explains the ethnic mix of the island well. Worth a visit as it is an escape from the malls and bustle of the city
,,Engaging and informative,5.0,,"Spent a couple of hours understanding the history of Singapore. The exhbits were well presented and easily understood. The rotunda comprised a vast, unusual and surprising moving graphical display showing a changing natural world."
,,Wow! Great for all ages and so much to see,5.0,,"This is a great museum for all. It is very accessible to all abilities, disabilities, and ages. The exhibits are very appealing to the eyes, ears, and nose (less to touch though). It is a nice introduction to the history of Singapore -- and that is my only negative in that it leaves out the years of the ""Emergency"" when many were called ""communist"" and imprisoned or executed (though in their defense they could classify that under Malaysian history I suppose, though it had ongoing consequences). Overall the mix of objects, stories, and immersive displays are wonderful for kids and adults."
,,Very interesting overview of the history of Singapore.,5.0,,"A beautiful building providing good insight into the history of Singapore. 1-2 hours is enough time to visit, and it is really good to see the museum is free for local residents - only tourists need to pay."
,,Interesting history,5.0,,"Very interesting to see the history of Singapore, the things used in the olden times, and the love story of a couple who lived during the Japanese occupation."
,,THE FALL OF SINGAPORE,4.0,,"We dropped into the National Museum, to see the Fall of Singapore display, The place is easy to get to via bus and is found on the tourist maps as well.
The display was very good and had lots of photos , displays as well as newspaper articles about the history.
The walk around took about an hour.
I am not sure if this display is still current but well worth the time to view."
,,Witness to War was most excellent!,5.0,,"As expat Singaporeans for the last 6 years, we'd make annual visits to the NMS thoroughly enjoyed the exhibitions. Upon our return in February, we went to appreciate Witness to War & we found it to be the perfect homecoming exhibition for my 13 y/o son & 11 y/o daughter. They inhaled the information & the visuals were riveting! The interactive Family Activity Space called A Child's Perspective was excellent. I also got to bring alive my childhood living in a kampung & shared my parents' & grandparents' war stories, albeit from a distance.
Next we rediscovered the history of Temasek. Always refreshing! Every Singaporean should visit as a family as it showcased vividly the progress of our nation. No spoiler ;)
We had a teatime break at the delightful Food for Thought cafe then soaked in the immersive digital installation Story of the Forest. Enchanting!
Every visitor who wishes to know more about Singapore's history should visit the National Museum."
,,"Fabulous, so much to see!",5.0,,"Could spend all day in this magnificent old building with latest displays of history, art and futuristic exhibitions. Could spend hours here. Excellent cafe/restaurant attached!"
,,A snapshot of Singapore's colourful history,4.0,,"There aren't too many cities on the planet which can boast of being the confluence of history and of myriad cultures for ages. Singapore, by virtue of its geographical location, has certainly been one and this museum does a fine job of capturing that.
Located close to the university campus, it sees a good number of young people.
Beginning with the Singapore Stone, it traces the impact of the various influences that came into the region - European, Indian Malay, Japanese and showcases the development of Singapore as a modern nation. There is also a great idea for children - a rotunda which showcases the story of the forest. Its a laser-driven display which you walk through as you go up/down a building. Kids will love it.
Nice museum shop also."
,,A special exhibition`,5.0,,We had some time to spare so decided to visit the museum for a couple of hours. Staff were most helpful giving us advice on how to get the best out of a short stay. We visited the WWII exhibition which gave the history of Singapore from its formation through to the present day but with special emphasis on the Japanese occupation from 1942-45. It was a really good exhibition
,,Packed with History,5.0,,"Were advised we needed 1 - 1 1/2 hours. We spent 3 hours there and it was wonderful. Not just Singapore history, but a section with wall graphics constantly changing - great for all ages."
,,Must to visit,5.0,,Singapore national museum is must to see if you visit Singapore. You need to wear comfortable shoes to feel comfortable walking around. The fee per person is 15 Singaporean dollars. It is divided to floors and times intervals. You can see different times closely.. Singapore has a great history needs to be looked at..the museum can give you a taste of this great history.. There is a gift shop and restaurant if interested. The closure time for entry is 5 pm
,,A brilliant museum,5.0,,We joined one of the guided tours and found the story of the development of Singapore absolutely fascinating. We were also very impressed with the WW2 special exhibition. We had an excellent lunch at the tea shop.
,,Such an Amazing Tour,5.0,,"I learned a lot about Singapore in here..thank you so much with the great hall that you had in National Museum . I really enjoyed about all the exhibition hall. Regards Dziauddin Mahamud Lavender,Singapore"
,,History gallery not to be missed.,4.0,,There is plenty to see in this well laid out museum. The History Gallery covers 6 centuries of life in Singapore. The Rotunda houses a wonderful display History of the Forest.
,,Learned a lot,5.0,,"Hid in here for 4 hours due to the heat and humidity. The exhibitions were great, especially the one on the History of Singapore and the War Years. I learnt so much. thank you"
,,Nicely laid out museum,4.0,,Nicely laid out museum with a good history of Singapore for those who don't know much about it. Would recommend if visiting the city - was nice to hear about the key figures in history after whom a lot of streets and areas were named after and understand a lot more about the different cultures.
,,Excellent way to gain an understanding of Singapore's history and culture,5.0,,"We came to Singapore not really knowing what to expect and with little to no understanding of its history and culture. We took a free guided tour that was available from 2pm in the foyer and it was a great way to understand more about the history, culture and outlook of this city nation. The sections I particularly enjoyed related to the 'birth of the nation' featuring very moving footage of Lee Kwan Yew and the section on HDB flats. Unfortunately we missed out on the WWII exhibition by one day. I would suggest visiting at the start of your trip. Very impressive building."
,,Wonderful history museum,5.0,,"This is a wonderful museum. I return every year and I'm never disappointed. This year they featured a special exhibition called ""1942"" that told the events of the year when the Japanese took control of Singapore in World War II. I took the tour, and the docent was very good. The exhibits included interactive elements with many first hand accounts of life during that year. The permanent exhibits are also interesting too. My only disappointment is that they no longer have a gift shop of any size, since this was a wonderful place to find interesting gifts in the past."
,,This museum is worth it!,5.0,,"We took a taxi from Amara Hotel to the museum. The museum's displays are well though out, informative, interesting, and beautiful. Well worth the time. Let me just say that people in Singapore are great! So nice, helpful, and eager to share about the area and places to eat. Just ask and they open up enthusiastically with recommendations and tips."
,,Informative and well done. Could have spent all day there,5.0,,We unfortunately only had a couple of hours but really wanted to learn more about Singapore. The museum is fascinating and incredibly interesting. I learnt a lot. Done in a way that makes it fascinating beyond the information it provides. Also one of the more reasonably priced museums. We‚Äôre students so it was only 10SGD
,,Very informative,5.0,,"Prior to visiting we knew little about Singapore‚Äôs history, we found the exhibitions to be informative and organised. Although we were not travelling with children a lot of the exhibition is multi sensory, meaning it would be enjoyable for a variety of ages. Museum was very clean, well maintained and situated by Fort Canning Park in a beautiful area.

Best of all, it was free!"
,,Beautiful space and excellent interpretation,5.0,,Well worth a stroll around if only for the space alone but the interpretation carries you through the braided river like evolution of Singapore as it is today The Japanese high tech exhibit was a wonderful bonus
,,Very educational,4.0,,The history of Singapore told in an interesting and informative way. Loses a dot for charging $15 entry fee for an adult - not including the special exhibition (which would have made it $26 total) which would make it pricey for a family.
,,Nice historical museum.,3.0,,"Very good section on the WW2 part of Singapore's history. A little expensive, compared to National Gallery and Asian Civilisations, and maybe not fully worth it."
,,Excellent introduction to the long history of this island nation.,5.0,,"Informative review of the history of the island from precolonial days, through the days of British occupation and the war, and on to modern day Singapore and its exciting future plans"
,,Wow,5.0,,"Probably the best museum building 'Ive ever visited and full of interest, especially the basement floor which was dedicated to the history of the War ."
,,What a concept,5.0,,"We bought the combo ticket. So we visited the war exhibition as well as the exhibition of the forest.
In the end it was the war again.
Such a theconcept: the atrocities of war committed by Japanese, the beauty forest depicted by Japanese artists and in the end how Singapur became such a prosperous country. Politics and depicting its presidential family.
Even the little restaurant is nice."
,,History of Singapore,5.0,,"Enjoyed our visit, beautiful building with an excellent restaurant and cafe. Many extra galleries. Their was also one on Changi experiences which was very interesting. You need atlas 2 hours or more to take it all in."
,,Comprehensive insight into Singaporean history,5.0,,"I visited the museum in the last few weeks of the 1942 exhibit, which was a special exhibit dedicated to the experiences of Singaporean residents during and after the fall of Singapore. It is comprehensive and personable, with stories from both adults and children who lived through a horrific time in Singapore history.

Also very worth seeing is the last 100 years of Singapore which divides the last 100 years into four rooms exhibiting how Singaporeans lived and how the city grew and changed over the years. For an even more in depth exploration of Singapore's history you can visit the exhibit that explores all the way back to before Singapore was made a British colony to today.

My favourite part other than 1942 was the beautiful forest in the Rotunda. Stunning beautiful graphics. Well worth taking the kids to."
,,Interesting to visit,5.0,,The museum is a place worth making the time to visit. It would be good to catch one of the guided tours. We caught the one at 11 a.m. It is a great way to educate oneself on the history of Singapore. This visit more than met our expectations.
,,Iconic Singaporean landmark with 130 years of history,5.0,,"This is museum is a must-visit, whether visitor or citizen of Singapore. In fact, admission is free to all citizens and permanent residence, which further encourages us to appreciate our roots and embrace our history. It had been a long time since I last visited the museum in schooling days, drawn this time to the ""Witness to War"" exhibit. It may not have been as full of exhibits and activities compared to the massive WWII museum I visited in New Orleans (USA), but it was still special especially because of the local context of ordinary courageous men and women struggling to preserve humanity amidst the occupation. We finished this exhibit in an hour but it left a lasting impression on us. Do check out the other exhibits as well and if you can also sign up for the free guided tours. There is much to learn about this ""little red dot"" of Singapore! P.S. parking may be limited especially on weekends but we were still able to find a lot easily when we visited."
,,Good museum in a lovely building,4.0,,"Great if you like visiting museums and it is located in a lovely building. Situated next to Fort Canning park where you can not only visit the park, but the WW 2 museum which is located within the park. Interesting recreations and history of Singapore."
,,A place of education about Singapore and its history.,5.0,,"A super place to visit when the weather is very wet. so interesting it
traces the origins of Singapore & its history, loads of displays & film clips, Also a very nice Food Eating Place if you are hungry, along with a good merchandise selection on offer for the visitor to buy. A very impressive place to discover."
,,Exceptional exhibits for historians,5.0,,"We were fortunate enough to visit during the ""Witness to War"" exhibit. Excellently curated!

We also took a tour of the Singapore History Hall with a marvelous tour guide, William.

We recommend this museum for a good background on the place of Singapore in the world today in its proper historical context."
,,"Great building, great history",4.0,,The building of the National museum is very cleverly extended at the back. Singapore's histrory is interesting and is shown in an interesting manner. I think all tourists need to make a visit.
,,Try to get to one of the free Monday Morning Lectures,5.0,,"This is a modern, well-thought out museum staffed with highly trained and informative Docents (guides). It's light and airy and easy to navigate. The cafe is a bit pricey."
,,Plenty to see,4.0,,"The museum easily reached by bus or MRT has all you wanted to know about Singapore, allow about 2-3 hrs time to walk round."
,,Get to really know about Singapore,5.0,,We had a delightful Singaporean Lady guide who gave us not only the official version but personal insights that were informative and entertaining. Well worth the time and to help understand how and why Singapore works as it does.
,,All you need to know about the history of Singapore!,4.0,,"If you have interest in economics and history, this is a must go, specially is you are not very familiar with this country. The visit helps you to understand the culture and economical stability of the country."
,,It is not worth a special visit,3.0,,"The museum is dedicated to the history of Singapore, but it is not very interesting and very poor. The most interesting thing is the Story of the Forest art installation."
,,Absolute must visit when in town.,5.0,,"If you love history this is a great place and a must. Loved the quality of displays and how the information was laid out. I knew very little about Singapore and it‚Äôs history but left feeling really well immersed.

They have done a fantastic job at keeping the quality of the exhibits updated and reflecting the best of modern big city museums.

The building is well air conditioned with great toilets, gift shop and cafe.
Really easy to get to and close to local MRT (tube) it took me about 25 mins to walk down to the Marina afterwards."
,,Few simple display only,3.0,,"There are 2 type of tickets , standard one only can see 5 rooms history display , nothing supprise me , just few simple old personal things collection display only , well the ticket is also not expensive , any way I like the colonial building construction and inside with modern renovate design ."
,,great Museum,5.0,,for a person who lives in singapore this museum keep on having different galleries and light shows. so you will not be going there once. for visitors you have to go see it :)
,,Beautiful building,4.0,,"I went here with 2 hours to kill before my flight home, I found it a little hard to navigate, I bought a general ticket for $15 but was unsure what I could access and couldn't. Still was a very interesting visiting learning about Singapore history. Loved the heritage building combined with modern extension on the back."
,,Grab a cultural feast!,5.0,,Great attraction and I always try to learn the history of the countries I visit. Especially ex-colonies. This museum certainly didn't dissappoint
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"We saw the special exhibit on WWII which was very interesting. We took the guided tour. Our guide was very pleasant & informative. We also viewed the gallery on,the history of Singapore which I really liked. It was laid in a very clear manner, nice exhibits & artifacts. There is so much information. The Museum is housed in a lovely old building with a newer part added on in the back. We also had lunch there. They have a gift shop as well. There were more galleries to see but we had to leave them for another day. You could easily spend an entire day in the Museum as there is so much to see."
,,"Interesting museum, well set out.",5.0,,A really interesting museum which was very informative about Singapore. Enough information without being too much.
,,Modernised elements added to National Museum of 130 years,4.0,,"Another ideal museum to learn about Singapore's history, especially for families with children. Recommended to start the tour from Galleries or Story of the Forest (digital installations) at Level 2 first, walking through Singapore's history Gallery. It would be great to visit special exhibitions in Basement floor, if there is sufficient availability of time. Also very accessible location getting to Fort Canning Park from back of this Museum."
,,A must for anyone wanting to understand this wonderful country and its heritage,5.0,,"An impressive permanent collection covering the earliest peoples to live here through the various periods in history including the British colonial era and the war and the transition to Independence. I found it fascinating and well laid out. They also have temporary installations in the Exhibition Galleries at basement level for which you have the option to pay extra. Currently until the 25th March 2018 it is Witness to War, which I found moving as it featured the personal stories of survivors in this bitter chapter in Singapore‚Äôs history. For me a must see museum if you are interested in history and in gaining an insight into this amazing country. There is a good caf√© and a nice looking restaurant called Flutes."
,,Interesting Exhibition on WWII in Singapore,4.0,,"we found the Witness to War exhibition to be very interesting, seeing the world in 1942 from a Singaporean perspective.
They have snippets from different films that were done around the time of the war and items like a WWII shelter for families and how they lived and coped with coming to terms with the invasion by the Japanese.
they also had on of the Japanese officers samurai sword which was used in Singapore.
This all prompted me to do some more research on this period due to my children's great uncle being in Z Force and I found an amazing book written by a historian called Deadly Secrets by Lynette Silver which gave me another insight into what happened in Singapore.
I did not realise how many locals Malay and Chinese lost their lives very bravely, so humbled by this and thank you to the museum for starting me on this journey."
,,Interesting museum,4.0,,"Visit if you are a museum person, many interesting facts and history related to Singapore that you can't get enough of it."
,,Worthy of a visit - great place for lunch,4.0,,"Take a break from the heat and humidity and visit this air-conditioned museum which tracks the founding, growth and development of Singapore from multiple perspectives including geological, cultural, historical, sociological, political and technological. Enter the Glass Rotunda on the top level and view the digitally produced Story of the Forest based on natural history drawings. The hands-on children's museum is fabulous in depicting life in Singapore. The Food for Thought restaurant offers appetizing and reasonably-priced dishes - we had a satisfying and hearty mushroom soup and delicious fish and chips."
,,Educational museum,4.0,,"The museum has a lot of reading. It is informative, but if you do not care to read, you won‚Äôt get a lot out of going to the museum. The temporary exhibition during our visit was about the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. It was done in a similar style as the rest of the museum, but more artifacts."
,,Awesome place to know the history of Singapore,5.0,,"Had a great day at the National Museum. You could literally spent the whole day just going thru what Singapore was, and how we went thru those trying times.

Currently, as of Feb 2018, there is an exhibition on the Occupation Period of 1942 during WW2. It is a great learning experience for both the young and the old.

Being your family there! For you won't regret the time spent here. You can always have lots of fun in Singapore, but you can't always learn about the history."
,,A must visit,5.0,,Apart from the wonderful building and the stylish extension this answers so many questions. Life under Japanese rule was haunting - same feeling of being abandoned as the Channel Islanders must have felt. The ambition of a tolerant rainbow nation is clearly set out. Most moving scene for me was the press conference on leaving Malaysia - such sadness but such hope.
,,Informative museum,4.0,,"Great detailed history of the island, the people, and the nation. Very detailed, but nothing especially unique about this museum compared to other national museums. It's pretty much exactly what you would expect from a museum."
,,Great way to get out of the sun for a couple hours,4.0,,A long line to purchase tickets but it moved quickly. Explored 2 levels and multiple exhibits on the basic $15 entry. Took 2 hours and we seen the history from a fishing village to a modern city. There was good information without being too much. Quite enjoyed ourselves and glad we went.
,,We spent so much time here,5.0,,"I was shocked at how much there was to see at this museum, I learned so much about Singapore‚Äôs history and there were so many galleries and exhibits, it‚Äôs easy to spend 2-4 hours here in my opinion. Good for all ages I think."
,,Nice place for day out,5.0,,"Well maintained and organized. Good place to spend with your children and teach them the history more practically. Nowadays I can see more video display which is available everywhere. Apart from this, great place to visit to learn Singapore history."
,,Quick bit of history,3.0,,"This museum does a decent job of showing you interesting bits of Singapore history in small doses. There are four or six galleries that break down history into 10 year periods which are quick to see if you don't want to spend all day in a museum. And well done as well. Also, right now - Feb 2018 - there is an excellent exhibit about the Japanese occupation of 1942. Best part are the oral histories of actual survivors. You stand in a circular space listening to their first hand account and watch pencil and ink sketches depicting the events as they tell it. SUPERB!"
,,Judge for yourself,2.0,,"My immediate observation was of disappointment. Disappointment that such a beautiful city full of fascinating history that occurred in recent times, is displaying minimalist facts and most in dark rooms.
The steps through the major periods are conservative, and yet in reality were dynamic.
The rotunda is a space that could take you through an experience of life lived through the many wars, habitants, and technology.

This is my view and I sincerely wish the museum to become what it is not now, an experience that captures the viewer."
,,Fantastic history lesson,5.0,,"Worth half a day of anyone's time. The wide range of exhibits, comprehensive but not overdone, tell Singapore's story from backwater fishing village to multicultural modern city. The museum tackles British colonialism head on, highlighting the things the locals value as well as less comfortable stories. It's an inspiring story. Take one of the free volunteer-led tours, for a friendly and informative starter, then wander at leisure around the beautifully airy building, which is a pleasure in itself. Entry is not expensive especially with the concessions for seniors and students. A must in Singapore."
,,A must see,5.0,,I cannot recommend this highly enough. A brilliant exhibition of the history and culture of Singapore. Set aside at least three hours.
,,Art in the City,5.0,,My visit coincided with Arts Festival so there were many extra art activities happening which was great bonus. Also visited as part of Indie Walking Tour so having a local give background added to experience.
,,great museum,5.0,,"this is a great museum to visit. you can spend hours here. so much to see. at the moment there is a major exhibition on the fall of Singapore, which is very well presented.the wow factor for me is the story of the forest. this is a digital projection inside a dome. flowers a blooming overhead.and as u walk down a slope the forest is around u. at the bottom u lie on your back and look up at the cascading flowers and the forest around u.don't miss this it is brilliant!!!!"
,,MUST VISIT!,5.0,,"So I am a photographer and art lover and have been to several galleries and museums but this one complete;y blew me away. It was a perfect mix of art and information, knowledge and fun. So well maintained!"
,,Left me disappointed,3.0,,The focus here is Singapore history. I'm a history buff and so was looking forward to my visit. I can't put my finger on why but this museum was something of a snooze. Surely the history of Singapore can be told with more pizzazz.
,,Really lovely building and very good exhibits,4.0,,"We visited the Museum to visit a specific exhibition - about Singapore and WWII - Witness to War: Remembering 1942. Exhibition was excellent and there are guides on site to take you through the exhibit.
Museum itself was also well presented, general exhibits really well presented.
A lovely building that's had modern addition - reminded me of London's Tate Modern in parts. Has a very nice gift shop and a cafe on site too."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,When we visited there was a marvellous exhibition of the development of Singapore. There was also a wonderful video experience of he rainforest for children I suppose but adults found it fascinating. There are two restaurants at the Museum. Unfortunately the high end restaurant was fully booked with an event. The more down market restaurant was fine for our needs.
,,One of the best museums in Singapore,5.0,,Excellent and educational museum. Really enjoyed my visit here and have been reciting facts since! Everyone should visit!
,,Interesting history of Singapore,4.0,,"We had limited time but very much enjoyed our visit, concentrating on the history of Singapore. The exhibits are well laid out and clear, and provide a fascinating insight into the stages of development of Singapore, which is about a whole lot more than Sir Stamford Raffles."
,,Enjoyable and informative,5.0,,A really enjoyable visit where we learned a lot about the history of Singapore and enjoyed seeing the exhibits. Highly recommend a visit
,,Learn the history of Singapore,4.0,,This is an excellent museum which has exciting and informative displays telling the history of Singapore. The light show in the Rotundra was beautiful.
,,One of the best,5.0,,"Amazing Museum, all superbly described. Learned a lot and enjoy it very much, done level 1 and level 2, a good 2 to 3 hours to spend there."
,,History of Singapore,5.0,,"The visit to the Museum was worth the visit. Tells you the history of Singapore since its creation. Spent half the day there, the exhibition was very good."
,,Great Historic collection,5.0,,"What I really liked about the museum was the effort to present an unbiased view of the history of Singapore in uncluttered and easy to follow galleries. The building itself was beautifully preserved. What I didn't know was that throughout the Japanese occupation the museum continued to operate as normal under both European and Japanese curators working together, and that huge amounts of documents and artworks were transferred from other collections to the museum to protect them and preserve them from destruction. A great place for any visitor to Singapore to spend a few hours."
,,First rate history museum,5.0,,"i was very impressed with the different ways that the museum conveyed history- documents, films, audio, art. There were parts that you really feel that you are in that era- the opium dens and Malaysia separation come to mind. I loved the temporary exhibit called Story of a Forest. The cafe was also nice. Very elegant and clean museum."
,,Provides a quick history of Singapore,4.0,,"We liked this because in less than 2 hours, we were able to get a good grasp on the history of Singapore, which dates back to the 14th century. We found that the most interesting part was from the 19th century forward, with two critical times being during WW II and from independence in 1965. One thing that we felt the museum could use is more opportunities to sit for a few moments while making one's way through the exhibits. Definitely worth a visit if you have any desire to know a bit more about the history of this fascinating city state."
,,Do not miss this museum in Singapore!,5.0,,"The main reason we went was because we saw and ad for the WWII exhibit and we were blown away, both by the temporary exhibit but also the permanent collection. If you are interested in the history of Singapore and you also want to see an amazingly restored and extended building come here.
You will learn about all aspects of Singapore's history, the artifacts and immersive nature of the collection is really well done. A must see!"
,,Impressive Place,5.0,,One of the place that I could recommend to everyone who visit Singapore.. Because there are always a few exhibition going on and also you will know more about Singapore.. Glad that I have time to go there to explore..
,,Wonderful Art,5.0,,"Great museum filled with ancient and modern Chinese art and exhibitions. We also saw a wonderful Musee D'Orsay exhibition of expressinist and impressionist art. Also, the buildings are as unique as the art."
,,Learn about the history of Singapore,4.0,,"Beautiful buildings - new and old. I joined a free guided tour which latest about an hour and took us through the main exhibit on the history of Singapore, our guide was knowledgeable and able to add a personal touch to the story which I liked, I would definitely recommend doing the tour. The museum is very history focused, and quite traditional. If you want to learn more about this fascinating Country, this is a good place to come. You could spend 1-2 hours here and just see the highlights, or half a day really going through everything."
,,Singapore National Museum,5.0,,"This impressive building is easily reached in Stamford Street, and houses an excellent collection, under a spectacular dome, which took two sets of builders to complete. It is free for all Singaporeans and Residents, but $10 for all others."
,,Cutting Edge Modern Display Techniques Changing Traditional Museum Experience,5.0,,"National Museum of Singapore is one of the must visit sightseeing in Singapore. I will say your visit is incomplete without your visit to NMS. We took pass for permanent Galleries which was for SG$15. All access pass was for SG$25. With our pass we were allowed to visit level 1 and 2. History of Singapore and in level 2, five Galleries focussing on humble beginning to present day metropolis. Despite its rich historic background the museum adopts the cutting edge display techniques redefining traditional museum experience.
Open 10 am to 7 pm. Flash photography and videography is prohibited."
,,Best Museum,5.0,,The place is nice and the ambiance is very good.A good place to visit to know more the wonderful history of this great country..
,,Great place for culture lover,5.0,,A great museum and building. You might spend hours here fascinated by their collections. There's a difference of admission ticket price for tourist but definitely worth visit.
,,A great cultural experience!,5.0,,"Spent half of my day getting to know the history and culture of Singapore and it was time well spent! Foreigners need to pay for the ticket which is about 15 Singaporean Dollars. When I was there there's a special exhibit going on where you have to pay higher to get a ticket for. However, just the regular ticket is already enough if you just want to get to know Singapore."
,,History of Singapore in 3 hours,5.0,,"Plan to spend at least 3 hours there if you want to know more about this fascinating Island Nation. From where it was just an ""island"" > seaport > colony of GB > Independence > modern-day Singapore. Very well organized mixed with multi-media exhibits.
One memorable moment is to watch late father of the nation LKY on TV announcing the birth of the new nation. Very touching and gained even more respect for him."
,,"Great Experience, Very Informative",5.0,,This was a well planned and extremely informative museum. If you are curious about Singapore history this museum will give a quick and interesting overview. Admission is free on certain days (such as New Year's Day).
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"We visit Singapore frequently and always enjoy visits to both the Museum and the Gallleries. Apart from the obvious exhibits to see They always have good cafes and the facilities for children are excellent The animated show in the Rotunda was amazing, culminating in an area that showed a night scene with bean bags to lie on. I am finding words can not describe it you will just have to go and see for yourself."
,,Art Gallery,4.0,,"Is located at quite a quiet area but it is really beautiful there! If I am not wrong, entry is free for Singaporeans:)"
,,Excellent multimedia displays tell the story of Singapore,5.0,,"I'm not a huge fan of museums, if truth be told; I have found so many to be dead boring. This one isn't. Housed in a splendid colonial building dating from 1887, it includes various multimedia displays and interactive exhibits that explain in an engaging way the history of Singapore. Having spent part of my childhood living in Singapore in the 1950s, the museum offered a fascinating insight into what life was like back then and how it has changed since.

I ate in the museum's bright and airy cafeÃÅ, 'Food for Thought' (there is a restaurant, but it looked rather posh and expensive). The cafeÃÅ was a little pricey and service was slow and erratic, but the food (including fish and chips!) was pretty good."
,,So much to see,5.0,,Love the building and the architecture. The review and focus on the war and what happened to the building I thoroughly enjoyed. If you like history this is the place to go and see how the war went for the British. Take at least 4 hours to see what you are paying for.
,,Two excellent exhibitions,5.0,,"This imposing building with its classical lines and impressive dome is adjacent to Fort Canning Park.
Admission fee is waived for Singapore nationals, everyone else pays.
Currently there is an excellent temporary exhibition ""Witness to War; Remembering 1942"" and there is a more permanent section on another floor ""We built a Nation"", which explores and illustrates the years 1965 to 1975 - a highly significant time which built the foundations of this highly successful island nation.
Both exhibits are equally worth your time to view, and are in any case very professionally presented.
An excellent museum, and certainly not a collection of stuffy relics."
,,Wonderful exhibits on a fascinating history,4.0,,"We only had time to visit the history gallery, which does a great job of showing how/why Singapore has evolved over the years. Highly recommended for anyone with any interest in history."
,,Interesting,4.0,,Very interesting. The history of Singapore. Well worth a visit if you do not know it‚Äôs history. Nice and cool inside for a break from the humidity.
,,Lovely museum,5.0,,"I love this museum with great information about the history of Singapore. They demonstrate with old pics, maps, activities and historical stuffs to tell the Singapore history which is easy to read and understand. They also offer free guide tour to visitors. I like the tour guide who tell the founding story of Singapore, which makes the visit even more fun!"
,,Brilliant museum that is a credit to Singapore,5.0,,"This is one of best museums that I have visited. It is well laid out in a beautiful building that is so easy to get to. The staff are incredibly helpful. If you like history and learning about Singapore, it‚Äôs people and how the nation was shaped, this is the place for you. They have a wonderful app as well"
,,Singapore history,5.0,,Impressive museum. Also suitable for kids with the interactive video screen about the forest. Clear overview how Singapore was funded. We were there 1 January the admission was free.
,,Loved it.,5.0,,"I love history and museums so this was a home run for me. Great way to get out of the heat, and learn about the history of Singapore. I spent a lot of time walking around the city during my trip so having a historical background on many of the areas and how the city was built was great. I spent majority of my time in the main Singapore history exhibit which is very well done. It is also extensive, I spent a good hour and half in that exhibit alone. It only took me another 30 minutes to go through the other exhibits on the 2nd floor. I did not pay extra to go to the 1940's exhibit.

Great museum. If you love history, this is the place for you. Also anyone who loves fashion - don't miss the exhibit on the 2nd floor with Singapore fashion - really cool."
,,Great way to learn,4.0,,We were there for a family holiday with young children. We love Southeast Asian history and we wanted our children to learn as well. Visiting this museum is time well spent. Staff were so friendly and the history was so rich. I rate this place highly as my children learnt in a fun way.
,,A nation built by migrants...so amazing..,5.0,,"During our travels..at times we take certain things for granted including historical museums that really tells you a nation's story of how a country is led. This is Singapore's amazing story of how its generation of leaders help built a nation comprising of immigrants from China, India, Malaysia and the Dutch East Indies. Its history dates back to 1849 and its the oldest museum in Singapore. Free admission for all Singaporeans and those foreign expats with a Singapore PR. Its huge and its outlook has a very colonial infrastructure as its a Commonwealth country with alot of British heritage . The exhibition was on Remembering the War (1942-1945). Its easy to get there by car or even by taxi.
I was intrigued by the historical separation of Singapore from Malaysia and being a Malaysian.. I wanted to know the real reason for its separation in 1963. Each gallery tells an insightful story of Singaopore's cultures, traditions and history. There's also a guided tour if anyone needs it. The staff are friendly and accomodating. The leaflets are self explanatory ...so you cannot get lost. Lots of pics and documentary on its first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. I
Its worth a trip. It would be enjoyable for all ages. We spent a good 3 hours there as we took our time."
,,Rich in history of Singapore,5.0,,"Great information on the history of Singapore. This museum is loaded with displays, so much to see and read. We wondered in expecting that a couple of hours would do us but 3 1/2 hours later we left with a loaded brain, not having seen the lot. Great old historic building, lots of space and uncrowded displays."
,,OMG! Such an awesome place!,5.0,,"The kids LOVED the place! It was SO interesting and highly informative! There was a quaint shop that sold some cool stuff. Note, they only take credit card payments here!"
,,2 ladies with calipers,5.0,,"A beautiful building!. The staff were accommodating with mum and her calipers with her slow walking pace. I saw this building from Hotel Rendevous, and a large banner for an exhibition titled ""Witness to War Remembering 1942"" . We went across to appreciate the building and to visit the exhibition which was sombre and so well done. From snooping in the gift shop I came across a brochure on The Battle Box tours in Fort Canning. It all tied in together and gave a massive history punch on the Fall of Singapore. Museums are not stuffy this is light and airy and relaxing."
,,Museum for the young and old,5.0,,"Fantastic museum about the history of Singapore, very fascinating for the adults as well as children. We had 5 kids with ages ranging from 1-12 years old, all finding the visit fun and educational. Strongly recommended if you are into history."
,,Insight into Singapore,4.0,,"As a Singaporean, visiting the renovated museum gives me an insight into thr history of Singapore. From the founding days to modern times, the museum brings guests through a timeline of Singapire history. The museum is large with many exhibits, and is very modern and informative. The trip was very enjoyable overall for the whole family.

On a side note, the museum is free for all Singaporeans and free for all on public holidays."
,,A refuge from the humidity but also very interesting,4.0,,"OK. Confession time. We're generally not museum buffs. But we were looking for somewhere to spend a few hours before we flew home. Air conditioning was first priority. Interesting place to be came a close second.

We went round 2 exhibitions during our visit as well as stopping for tea and cake. We also looked around some of the more permanent parts. We found it all to be engaging and very pleasant. No hustle. No rush. And thought-provoking content."
,,Good overview of Singapore history,5.0,,An excellent museum with a delightful coffee shop/restaurant. The transformation of the building is impressive as are the various displays on the history of SIngapore.
,,Curated exhibitions on Singapore history,5.0,,Located near shopping belt Orchard Road. Noticeable beautiful facade of building. Takes you through the history of Singapore. Excellent service and facilities
,,My favourite place,5.0,,I'm a born bred Singaporean . Yes.. Singaporean go in free. But way before that must pay. And I did pay. I don't mind paying to know more about history of Singapore. Though by now history books should have told us enough. But now more interactive activities at level 2 of museum. Have to walk about more. I been there more then 10 times and I never get bored going to museum . To each is own. U may love it or hate it. But I love my museum on Singapore . Definitely can't compare to overseas museum as our history is much lesser then other country. Hope this helps!
,,Understanding Singapore,5.0,,This museum is a must visit in Singapore if you‚Äôre keen to understand Singapore‚Äôs history and place in the world. There‚Äôs a great display charting Singapore‚Äôs development and history and an excellent display on Singapore during WWII. It‚Äôs in a beautiful building not far from Marina Bay...a cab ride cost less than $10. There‚Äôs good coffee in the cafe behind the museum shop. Well worth a visit.
,,A history of Singapore,5.0,,Singapore's history is fascinating. Here you will learn about some of its struggles- World War Ii among other transformative events
,,"Always an excellent meal, well cooked and at a reasonable price",5.0,,A lovely garden where previously one could sit outside and have a cocktail and cigarette and this pleasure should be reinstated
,,A wonderful place to visit,5.0,,"The high light for me was an excellent exhibit of WW II and an excellent guide. I travel a lot and this was one of the best I have seen. It may be temporary. The other parts of the museum are well done, very informative and well presented."
,,Excellent museum.,5.0,,"Like the rest of Singapore, this museum is impressive. The architecture is pretty stunning - juxtaposing an old colonial building with a cavernous, multi-storey annex.

I only had time to visit two of the galleries. The first was the Singapore history gallery, which was a really excellent introduction to the history of this city state.

I also visited a second gallery which contains a collection of objects gifted by the former prime minister.

Sadly didn't have time to visit more of the galleries. I can certainly recommend going if you are in SG."
,,Excellent museum,4.0,,Highly recommended to understand the history of Singapore and how the small city state has managed to survive since the uk left
,,Special exhibits are worth a visit,4.0,,"Singapore has several good museums including the National Museum of Singapore. This Museum has both standard exhibits and special exhibits - in early December, this was showing IMPRESSIONIST paintings on loan from France. While this exhibition did not show a large number of paintings, it did exhibit some of the most important artists during the IMPRESSIONIST period including paintings from Monet, Renoir and Cezanne.
Importantly, the history of IMPRESSIONIST painting was laid out in a sensible historical way.
I enjoyed this visit."
,,Pricey but worth a visit,5.0,,National Museum provides a good glimpse into the history of Singapore. They have many timely exhibitions which are worth a visit. Overall pricey but worth going once.
,,A Museum as usual,3.0,,"Just like any museum, nothing special. But I felt the admission fees is expensive, $15 per person. I don't think I will go back."
,,Interesting museum if you want to understand Singapore,4.0,,"Nice museum, both the building and the exposition. Free tour that gave more colour to the items exhibited."
,,Great History Lesson,5.0,,Had spent Saturday outside and decided Sunday would be best spent indoors in air conditioning! Was staying very close to Museum and had a recommendation from a local. Very well done exhibit on the history of Singapore that took a couple hours to go through at a comfortable pace. The other exhibits were okay - but the history section had the most impact.
,,WORTH A VISIT FOR HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF SINGAPORE,4.0,,"It is worth a visit to the National Museum if you want to learn the historical perspective on the development of Singapore. The first floor highlights the beginnings when it was not much more than a village to where it is now. It is well done with lots of audio and visual, all of which was in working order. We spent about an hour and a half which is probably about average."
,,Pricey but interesting nevertheless,4.0,,"At. SG$ 19 for a senior discounted ticket I find it very very expensive. So if you know or are not interested in Singapore History give it a wide berth.

I found it interesting and informative, much more so than the readings I had done before coming to Singapore.

The exhibits are nothing out of the ordinary but they do provide a sense of the history of the Island and the special exhibition of the Japanese occupation during WWII was also interesting.

There is however at least one big mistake in the panels. Governor St. George Ord in his 1875 portrait, oil on canvas, is certainly NOT in a military uniform. It is a Colonial Service uniform, which has minor differences with the Foreign Service Uniform."
,,Really well done,5.0,,"We were initially taken back at the high cost but ended up spending 6 hours here because there was so much to see! It was all really well presented and provided a really good overview of Singapore‚Äôs history and achievements. There‚Äôs also a lovely cafe where we enjoyed lunch - some veggie options available. One the best museums we‚Äôve been to, really recommend."
,,"IT WOULD BE REMISS OF YOU NOT TO VISIT, WHEN IN SINGAPORE",5.0,,"Amazing building and beautifully curated world class museum. The story of Singapore is extremely interesting and emotive. It will appeal to all ages. Need to spend a couple of hours here. It isn't surprising that this beautiful country has evolved to what it is today, when you understand the struggles and the commitment of Singapore's incredible leaders."
,,Excellent museum in beautiful building.,4.0,,"The history of Singapore was very well presented in this beautiful building. I enjoyed the top floor how it was split into decades & the occupation years from 1942 - 1945 was very sad.
I felt that the costume area could have been better presented. the models were plain grey with no features, they needed a basic face & hair! The ancient history & colonial history was very good, but we ran out of time to see all of it. There's a beautiful restaurant to the left of the entrance & the rotunda is an excellent event/display area."
,,Lovely place to visit for an hour,5.0,,"My friend loves visiting museums, but I wasn't too keen. When I went there I loved the art and the greenery around the museum. Click lots of pictures against the white building architecture."
,,very interesting museum,4.0,,the collection is about the history of Singapore which I found very interesting. I learned much about the old times.
,,Hours of historical knowledge,5.0,,"National museum has so many interesting artifacts on Singapore‚Äôs history that goes back centuries. Our guide Hilary was knowledgeable and made the facts so easy to understand. The gallery on the Japanese occupation was good.
My Canadian friends and I learned much on our visit which lasted 4 hours."
,,Fascinating Guide to Singapore History,4.0,,"The National Museum is close to a few MRT stations and definitely worth a visit. The displays are varied in style with a lot of audio and visual material as well as artifacts. The dedicated display at the moment is Witness to War : Remembering 1942 which is a well thought out and sobering guide to the lives of a variety of Singaporeans during the War. A decision to illustrate their stories through large scale animation is a clever one, making it at once personal and accessible"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"We walked to the museum and when we walked in we were excited about what t we were going to see, the glass show as you walked around was mind blowing it took our breathe away we couldn't stop saying how fabulous it was this museum is a must see and you can get seniors which is great"
,,20 sgd good payed,5.0,,"I think this museum is world class category all that I wanted to learn about singapore is easy to find, technological advanced and good spaces"
,,Not that exciting!,3.0,,"The National Museum wasn't that appealing to a foreign tourist. There wasn't much help at the help desk and it was quite gloomy. On top of that, the unreasonable price couldn't be matched to the lowly facilities that they offered. Luckily for us, we entered from the back entrance (straight road from the Battlebox) which basically gave us a free entry."
,,Wow,5.0,,The most wonderful installation. Into the forest. Exquisite animations that tell the story of Singapore ‚Äòs national history. Really special.
,,An excellent starting point to learn about Singapore,5.0,,"Very informative, especially around the founding of Singapore and the war. I remember Lee Kwan Yeu from my youth, and he founded a country to be proud of, with all citizens equal. A must see."
,,Singapore History Well Showcased,5.0,,"We had the guided tour of the war experience which as always is brought to life by personal stories.I enjoyed most of the exhibits although for a very modern country finding suitable exhibits must be difficult.The temporary forest exhibition was fantastic and worth the admission on its own. I thought that the cafeteria menu and ambience poor and you have to wait to be seated.
There was a discount for the over 60s worth remembering at admission."
,,Nice Museum,3.0,,"Nothing special, but good presentation of Singapore's history, from ancient times to the present. There was also a good temporary multimedia exhibit."
,,Must see!,5.0,,"Wonderful building, impressive exhibitions, the museum is worth a visit to understand the history and culture of Singapore. Must see!"
,,Well presented displays of Singapore history,4.0,,"The museum is worth a visit to understand the history and culture of Singapore. The displays showing the influence of trade on the evolution of the city-state and its impact on lifestyles in the different communities that make up the state are fascinating and insightful.
The accounts of the impact of the Japanese occupation during WWII are harrowing while the personal stories recounted are inspiring. Well worth the visit and investing a couple of hours exploring."
,,Good to see early in your visit,5.0,,"It's an excellent museum - interesting and well laid out. Understandably parochial, but never off-puttingly so. Ended up spending a couple of hours here, and could have stayed longer.

Taking it in at the start of a trip would really put much of the modern day Singapore that you encounter as a visitor into context."
,,Fabulous Place,5.0,,Wonderful building mixing odd and new. Superb exhibitions and managed to catch the most amazing music being performed in the atrium. Would definitely recommend.
,,War Time in Singapore,4.0,,"A chance visit as we were just passing by. There was an exhibition on depicting Singapore during Wartime, Excellent. Not only that there were other exhibitions on too. We just ran out of time. Agggh"
,,Best Museum Featuring Singapore's History,5.0,,"Of all the museums that we have visited in Singapore, the NMS documents Singapore's past, present, and future most comprehensively. The NMS is broken up into sections and tickets are sold for each exhibition or as a combination thereof. We opted for the Singapore History Gallery initially. However, we ended up having to return to see the other exhibitions.

The best pieces of advice are to (1) arrive early, (2) purchase admission to all exhibitions, and (3) plan to spend an entire day at the museum. Food and beverage are available, so is car/scooter/bike parking. If you do not have time to spend the whole day here, do a little research and decide on what is more important. For us, that is Singapore history!

The guided tour was nice. The guide was knowledgeable and provided useful information not available on the panels. However, if you are not a part of the tour, the tour guides can be quite loud, but not louder than children running around and yelling (downside)."
,,Sightseeing at the museum,4.0,,Lovely spacious place with cool air-conditioning. Great place to hang around for the afternoon at your own slow pace.
,,Worth spending a couple of hours or more,4.0,,"This museum is well set up, really interesting and really shows the history of Singapore.. Highly recommend spending the time to sit and listen to the videos and clips of Singapore's history."
,,Unique experience!,5.0,,"This was one of the best museums of its kind I ever visited. Well organized with all explanations a visitor may need. I spent whole afternoon there which was not enough. I've learned soooo much about this fascinating state/city and I wish I could have stayed longer.
Most recommended!"
,,Great place,5.0,,"The perfect combination of classical and modern architecture museum, unique exhibition space You should come to visit ----- TICKET : about 10-15 S$ If you have a student card you can get discount tickets about 5 S$ ^^!"
,,Wonderful exhibition,5.0,,All singapore's history can be found here. The building has been renovated and it is good shape. The tour is an eye opener into singapore past and present state.
,,Beautful building - lots to learn,5.0,,Good museum. Very hard to find front entrance if you entre via the gardens in fort canning. Had to ask several times. Lots of different things to do inside and working your way around can be difficult.
,,Interesting history on display,4.0,,The museum is well worth a visit to learn about the different people who helped shape modern Singapore. Loads of info about the wars and early life in Singapore. Food and some souvenirs available for purchase.
,,wonderful tour guid,5.0,,WE were given an hour tour by a lovely lady volunteer who was very knowledgeable and able to keep both myself and my 15 year old grandson interested

,,A Great Visit,4.0,,What a great way to fill in a few hours before our flight out of Singapore. Lots of things to see and we all enjoyed what we seen of the Japanese invasion
,,trip to the Museum,5.0,,This museum is amazing. You get to full understanding of the history of Singapore including the events of the war. Its a must do while in Singapore.
,,I learnt a lot about Singapore's history ! (I'm from France),5.0,,"First time for me in Asia, so I went to NMS to learn history about the part of the world.
It was fantastic. FYI I'm from France, the ""Old Europe"", and was not so much aware about history of Singapore. This museum gave me clear information from the ""creation"" of the town, its development, its strenght.

I really appreciated the level 1 ""Singapore History Gallery"" with a really well organized learning trip. Then the second thing is about the special exhibition ""Witness to war"". As I said for World War II I'm most familiar with war in Europe, but there I was able to learn a lot about this part of the world during WWII !

It's to be done if you come to visit Singapore, really ! (Also If you are like me far far away from home :-) )"
,,Great place to visi,5.0,,"This is the second time I‚Äôve visited in 2 years. Spent several hours in the History of Singapore wing and didn‚Äôt get to see anything else this time. Really well done with displays and exhibits starting from very early times, the cultural mix, through the colonial times, World War 2, and history since independence ."
,,Excellent explanation of Singapore History,5.0,,Absolutely loved this museum. It explained everything you need to know about Singapore. We learned in depth history of pre WWII and after. The mind set of the government and why and what they do. It explains why the city is full of trees and is so clean. It explains the suffering the locals endured during WWII. The other exhibits were amazing as well. They had a really cool interactive video garden. Hard to explain... You just need to go see for yourself. It is a visual paradise.
,,Day visit,5.0,,"This is an excellent, well laid out and very informative museum.
There is both a cafe and full restaurant in the facility. Entrance is S$10 (Senior). Exhibits are most professional and very very interesting. Singapore has a fascinating history!
Well worth the visit and easy to a access by walking/MRT."
,,WHERE ARE THE STREET SIGNS?!,5.0,,"We eventually got here (on a typical hot and steamy Singapore day) after exiting the Bras Basah MRT station to be confronted by numerous modern office blocks and no directions to this national museum - the first one we saw was directly outside the museum with an arrow pointing to the entrance! Luckily my phone was able to point us in the right direction.

As for the museum - we spent over 4 hours in there viewing the various collections - some permanent and others of a temporary nature. The current one depicting the Fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942 was very well laid out, clear to understand and a worthwhile addition to the entry price (if you are passing through as a stopover in the city - keep your boarding pass as it entitles you to discounted pricing on various attractions, one of which is this museum).

There is a small cafe onsite, not the cheapest in the city and the quality was variable, but if you are looking for something more substantial (and much pricier) the excellent Flutes restaurant is onsite (and the equally pricey Janice Wong place in the same building)"
,,Very interesting Museum,5.0,,"Lots to see here about the story of Singapore. There is currently an exhibition concerning Singapore and WWII, highly interesting and informative. The permanent exhibits are good too. Beautiful historic building and grounds. I did think entrance for foreign tourists is a bit pricey."
,,Wonderful Exhibitons,5.0,,"Had a Sunday morning exploring this wonderful museum. So much to see we enjoyed the exhibition which showed the development of Singapore & the war years. It is an amazing insight into how such an extraordinary City came to be.
The war years are also very thought provoking and extremely personal."
,,Worth paying to see all exhibits,5.0,,"My visit to Singapore‚Äôs National Museum today was well worth the SG$26 entry fee giving me access to all permanent and special exhibits.

I started with the history gallery, the biggest at the museum, and it was very interesting spanning from the 14th century to modern times, including their invasion by Japan in 1942 during WWII.

I later visited the forest exhibit on level 2, an animated exhibit projected on the walls as you walk down a spiral walkway. An app allows you interaction with the exhibit should you choose.

Other exhibits included childhood toys, more about experiences and times during the Japanese occupation, and colonial times.

Well worth a visit, enjoyed mine."
,,Was educated,5.0,,"Lovely museum, we learnt so much about Singapore's history, There was also an extra wartime exhibition which I found fascinating. The museum is well spaced out and well air conditioned. We had tea and cakes at the restaurant which was very pleasant. A must do when you visit Singapore."
,,BRILLIANT MUSEUM,5.0,,"My wife was enthralled at the Brilliant showing of Singapore up to 1975 by stages, in different rooms,
and just to wander around , not too crowded when we were there. they have a restaurant inside and out. Also a showing on the walls of a round centre, of a light show , Singapore through the ages of animals etc."
,,A wonderful building and displays but just misses the in depth,4.0,,"I feel a bit like Ian W below- I learnt a lot, more than I had previously known but at the same time, there was a fair degree of superficiality and lacked depth. The city has been through and succeeded admirably in so many ways and I expected more in depth.
In fact, I left with more questions than I started with and I went back to my hotel to do some heavy googling."
,,130 years anniversary visit,5.0,,Another must see. Everything is excellently curated and a terrific learning experience for young and ld.
,,Nice experience,4.0,,"In the beginning I thought it was a bit hard to find my way through everything, as the gallery is huge. The view from level 6 was cool!"
,,"Beautiful colonial building, shlick presentation, but didn't learn much about Singapore",3.0,,"The history section on the ground floor was the best bit, but it was still a little empty. It touched on the key stages in the history of Singapore, but there was no depth, no discussion and no tension. In fact, I had trouble working out a story as I moved from room to room, just artifacts and portraits and points in time. Suddenly brittish appear, suddenly there's a malaysian independence, then suddenly, there's independent singapore. Singapore is such a melting pot, it would have been good to see the Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist cultures learning to live together (with both ups and downs), the struggle with Colonial powers, and the wider Malaysia and the trials of becoming a modern city. Maybe this museum is more for the locals and assumes we already know the details."
,,A museum that you have to visit in SG,5.0,,"For 10 SGD, i think it worth every penny of it

The museum has a lot amount of informative matter related to Singapore history and singapore development, and also it displays the life as singaporeans

The building is also nice and can be a photo spot, they still keep the heritage building well maintained"
,,"Wonderful historic building, wide range of exhibits",5.0,,The recent renovation of this building and newer exhibits keep this museum current --- it's a stunning building architecturally. Loved all the exhibits and learning indepth about Singapore's history
,,Great museum,5.0,,Very vivid way (videos statues pictures etc) to tell history. I assume you guys need at least 2 hours for it (I only had around 1 hour. Too short!!).
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"If you really want to understand Singapore, this museum is eye-opening. Gave us so much knowledge and better understanding for this beautiful City-state. Everything was well appointed and easy to understand."
,,Beautiful and nice place to visit,5.0,,"It was not hard to find this place, and I love how quiet it is inside with so much natural bright light. Good to take pictures."
,,Interesting,5.0,,"Well worth a visit for the history and for the building itself, just beautiful. We were there to look at the 'Witness to War' exhibition, which was extremely interesting and indeed the whole museum was a wonderful experience, the whole place flowed seamlessly, and was very easy to navigate."
,,Eat like a King for cheap,5.0,,"Loved Chinatown. Great cheap eats with the tourists and locals. My favourite place is the Maxwell Hawker Hall. We ate from 5 different vendors - including the famous Tian Tian. Yummy Hainanese Chicken Rice served so simple and tasty - washed down with a beer and for me a cider. I had amazing noodles from the stall same side as Tian back right corner (furthest from the road). They were doing a professional photo shoot for a magazine when we visited. Share a table with the locals - its damn hot in here, but so much fun. I could not eat another bite of food full to the brim the two of us with multiple drinks for around $50. Try it all - you will love it. Can't wait to return. Food highlight."
,,National Museum is good place to spend 2-3 hours,4.0,,"This museum is not so large, but plan to spend 2-3 hours at least to view several interesting galleries. Such helps to understand Singapore from centuries ago thru the Japanese occupation thru the modern era. ""Very educational with neat exhibits"""
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"A beautiful display of documents, artifacts and artwork relating to a great place.

I walked in seamlessly but was told to get a red sticker at the entrance. The museum is open and welcoming.

It‚Äôs definitely worth a visit to learn about the history of Singapore."
,,Intersting history and very well displayed,4.0,,"This is a museum that's well wlorth the visit, for the story of the city and for the way it's presented. Such beautifull displaus, very interactive. The history is split up in decades making it easily digested chunks.
But the highlight is definitively the rotunda which features an animated nature movie spread out over three levels. Hard to describe, but it's mesmerising, enchanting."
,,Stunning Building. Content a Little Disappointing,4.0,,I cannot fault the magnificence of the museum building. It has been lovingly maintained and is a credit to its custodians. However I was a little disappointed in the display content. In parts it seemed a little sterile. However the virtual garden was magical.
,,History of Singapore,4.0,,Was worth the trip to get a better understanding of the history of Singapore. Currently has an exhibition on the effect of WW II and the fall of Singapore. The exhibit on the Forrest across several floors was really worth going into.
,,Phenomenon of Singapore,5.0,,"National Museum of Singapore. Located at 93 Stamford Road, I have visited many museum around the globe, Singapore National Museum has to be one of the best, if you are into history and especially the elevation of Singapore from its humble beginnings up until nowadays, and to become one of the world's prosperous country, then I would strongly suggest a visit. The National Museum gives you a great understanding of Singapore's history in a remarkable and explanatory way, from the Year 1882 to design a dedicated building for the Museum .The displays were all well-presented and easy to navigate, Artefacts are categorized by galleries according to its timeline in history, and there appeared to be good undertakings for children as well. The highlight of the museum structure has to be the rotunda and neo-Palladian fa√ßade. While visiting Singapore and you have a free day, I Strongly recommend to pay a visit to this remarkable country, this is not an ordinary national museum it is phenomenon of Singapore."
,,Fantastic museum,5.0,,WE really enjoyed this museum. Great history and so creative. DOny miss it! REally liked all of the special effects. THe conclusion where singapore statistics are presented is veery impressive
,,The Must Visit in Singapore!,5.0,,"This is easily one of the best museums that I have been to! Informative yet interactive, and best of all, never a second of dull moment! Talk about the immense effort, design, and time the team has put in to make this place such a gem!

I would strongly suggest to browse through the museum's detailed website prior to visit, in order to have a better understanding on the accessibility and on-going exhibitions. Ticket price for foreign visitor is S$15.

We had a very thorough tour and spent almost 6 hours in the museum! We especially love the Glass Rotunda the most! Strongly recommended to pay a visit at least once even though you may not be an avid museum goer as we are, but rest assured that this is not an ordinary national museum and fun is guaranteed :)"
,,A little disjointed,3.0,,A great museum that gives you a good understanding of how this country was formed. My one small criticism is that sometimes the museum can seem a bit disjointed when you enter one part you can miss something else and have to go back
,,Excellent!,4.0,,Great exhibitions and gives you a great understanding of the history of Singapore. Well worth visiting.
,,History Of Singapore Explored !,4.0,,"To understand Singapore past , you have to be there .

This country even after suffering for years rose to a great power , we can experience the whole of it in the museum . An excellent way of telling people Singapores story

A must visit site to know Singapore & their people better

Thanks
Sonam & Varun"
,,Singapore's history in detail.,4.0,,"I'm no history buff but I enjoyed my visit in NMS. They show you in detail the history of Singapore as a nation; from its humble beginnings up until how it became to be one of the world's successful countries.

Artifacts are categorized by galleries according to its timeline in history so its like walking back through time while going through it. The interiors of this building is beautiful as well.

If you are into history and have a free day and you just want to relax and chill, then a visit to this museum will be perfect for you."
,,the Best,5.0,,Had been in many National Museum but Singapore never failed at amazing people. Charming restaurant lead us to many surprise. a must destination when in Singapore
,,History of Singapore presented so well,5.0,,"We know the wartime experience of Singapore pretty well, but following our visit we now understand both the traditional history of this fascinating place and, more importantly, how Singapore arose from the carnage of 1942-45 to make its place as a leading centre of modern Asia in the 21st century.

Great displays, great commentary, and all in a fascinating building complex that combines colonial and modern architecture."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Spent a few hours wandering through the galleries. You get a very good idea of the history of Singapore, from the very beginning through to more modern times. Don't miss the digital display walk from the second floor, very worthwhile."
,,Fab day at this super museum,5.0,,"We spent the best part of a day in the museum, it tells the story of the history of Singapore in an easy to follow but detailed way.
It is a modern museum and utilises sensible and imaginative technology to inform and make you think, there are detailed exhibitions in separate galleries relating to the pre colonial days, Raffles and his peers of course, the fall of Singapore to the Japanese and rise of the modern city state.
So much to see, a fabulous museum and the restaurants are not bad either, we had a very nice lunch!"
,,Recommend Visit by Tourists - One of the Major Museums in Singapore,5.0,,Review by Dr Sim. This is one of the major museums in Singapore. Old museum. Recommend visit by Tourists. Nice walk through. Many things to see. Regards DrSim001
,,Truly a national museum about the nation's history for visitors and locals alike,5.0,,"With so many quality galleries within walking distance (National Art Gallery, Singapore Art Museum, Asian Civilisations Museum, and Peranakan Museum), just why should anyone consider the National Museum of Singapore (NMS)?

Well, one important reason is that while the other museums and galleries provide narratives about the South East Asia and Asia, NMS is unapologetically and exclusively about the nation's narrative from the 13th to the 21st century, at least up to the passing of Lee Kuan Yew in 2015.

The modest size of the museum, relative to the British Museum and the national museums of many nations, suits the relatively short history of Singapore (Tumasik, Dan maxi). The galleries span three floors and are thoughtfully curated to provide a fluid narrative of the nation. If Singaporeans think they know and understand their nation's story from the history and National Education (or Character & Citizenship Education) lessons in school, then they are very much mistaken. The exhibits offer intimate insights into the narratives through visual and auditory stimuli that no teacher or textbook can provide. The museum context also means that viewers are focused on engaging the themes for understanding rather than scoring in tests and examinations.

For visitors to Singapore, the galleries will help them better appreciate the significance of the various landmarks they visit. It is in the context of the past that the present Singapore is better understood. Otherwise, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore River, China Town, Little India, Geylang Serai, etc, are no more than tourist traps meant to bring in the tourist dollar.

NMS provides a coherent visual narrative of Singapore from its days as a trading post, Crown Colony, Syonan-to, through to a modern independent city-nation. It is perhaps, at the time of this review, the only such establishment to do so.

Expect to spend up to 3hours at NMS, longer if you intend to have a meal at one of its two restaurants.

Singaporeans and Permanent Residents enjoy free admission."
,,High tech museum,3.0,,"This is the place to ""kill"" time on a sunny hot day, while hosting oversea guests.

You able to understand the history of Singapore as you walk through all the things exhibition hall. There are many interactive devices like torch screen TV and headphone by the station/artifacts.

You need to buy ticket to access to the exhibition hall. SGD15/adult.

You able to reach there by public transport ."
,,Gorgeous colonial building and OK museum,3.0,,"We'd done most of the big attractions in Singapore, and thought this would be an interesting hot/rainy day activity......and it did score on that aspect. The exhibits were interesting for the most part, but it lacked a coherent ""flow"" and the animations were a tad garish and amateurish (especially in the forest exhibit). I would have liked more of a time-line to guide us through the history of Singapore. Maybe, I would have got more out of it if we'd been in time for the guided tour. We did visit most of the rooms, and we it was informative. Would recommend as a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. $15 adults, $10 for seniors (over 60)."
,,First Class,5.0,,This is what a museum should be like. Great building and very interesting displays. The history of Singapore was especially good. All staff helpful and friendly
,,Informative visit,5.0,,"Very nice museum inside a beautiful old building which has been extended out the back with modern glass halls. An abundance of information of the history of Singapore, as well as cultural and social changes to the country over time.

$15 per adult entry, can spend anywhere from 1-3 hours here depending how much you want to see or read."
,,Great place to learn about Singapore,5.0,,"It's a great place to learn about the history of Singapore, how this small country came to be, and its development over the years. They often have changes in exhibits too and the latest includes The Glass Rotunda. The National Museum of Singapore is good for anyone, including kids."
,,National Museum of Singapore - a must.,5.0,,"We visited here somewhat by an aside. Don't make this mistake, it was well worth the time and entry fee.
You absolutely must enter the 'Story of the Forest' exhibit. OK its at first a little twee as you stroll down the winding slope and the images constantly change as you go. BUT the real deal is at the bottom (hinted at as you first enter up top), just go in, grab a beanbag if you can and lie down and be amazed. Surreal & Zen cascading flowers and petals and around the base a forest grows and animals appear but its the falling flowers and petals ... magnificent and so calming. A absolute must if you are in Singapore."
,,Absolutely a must see for a history lover...,5.0,,"A great museum to enjoy and relax away from the heat and humidity outside. A must for anybody who likes history. I am always amazed by histories of many ethnic groups, their strive to succeed and their hardships to overcome in cities around Asia. Singapore is no different with its rise to prominence as a trading port during the British rule and being built by a large influx of Malay, Chinese and Indian laborers and traders. The incoming museum sign ""We built a nation"" says it all.

A big part of the museum is devoted to the WWII period and the life and suffering under Syonan, the Japanese occupation from 1942-45. And even a bigger part to the political, societal, cultural and economic development of the city state post WWII and Singapore successful strive for independence in 1965 and becoming one of the richest countries in the world under the leadership of its premier minister, Lee Kuan Yew, and his PAP party. A little propaganda-ish but hard to argue with their achievements today.

I'm a huge sucker for old maps; coins & paper money and historical posters exhibits, and there are some to enjoy.

Plus, Singapore, being promoted as the ""garden"" city, you must visit the audiovisual feast of flowers falling inside the glass rotunda in the modern wing of the museum. It is amazing and worth to experience it just laying down on the floor. You feel almost just like inside the movie Avatar. It's called ""The story of the forest"" and I'm pretty sure it's just a temporary exhibit. So, don't miss it;)

It is a little hard though not to get lost if you want to follow the exhibits chronologically. Devote at least 2 hours to enjoy it, or much more if you like to ponder over every exhibit details.

Recommended for kids, too... They will definitely like the Glass Rotunda exhibit."
,,A Singapore Highlight,5.0,,"I think National Museum of Singapore is the first visit you have to do in this city in order to understand better its history and costumes. It's essential a wide visit and it takes a long time to do it.
I highly recommend the part dedicated to the Second World War and the Japanese occupation.
Excellent reports and information during the tour."
,,A greatly improved museum,4.0,,"I first visited the museum over 20 years ago and left with a distinctly disappointed memory. Old cupboards full of dusty and dirty exhibits and... well it was just awful. To the point that when I saw the website featuring the history of Singapore I reflected on what I had seen in the past and nearly gave it a miss. I'M SO GLAD I WENT!

The museum is now something to be so proud of and I greatly enjoyed the entire experience. There were plenty of locals and tourists here and the history of Singapore is so well worth the experience. Make sure you leave plenty of time - at least 2 hours. It is air-conditioned, clean, well displayed and very engaging. There is a Seniors discount available and, I believe a discount for Students but check the website.

I would have no problems recommending the National Museum of Singapore. It is GREAT"
,,Unexpectedly compelling,4.0,,"We didn't expect to spend all that long in the museum, but in the event , we were there hours ! Beautiful heritage building with landings and corridors filled with light and sun, though perfectly cooled.
High tech compared to many museums , and , we thought, a balanced and intelligent approach to recent history ."
,,Fabulous place to visit,5.0,,"We were 2 hrs at the Museum and only just saw one floor, there are Three floors.but time ran out for us What we saw was fantastic and will be going back to see the rest."
,,"Great museum, wonderful building",5.0,,"Lovely museum in a beautiful heritage building. Well worth the visit. Don't forget your Seniors or Student cards, to get a good discount on entry."
,,Great museum,4.0,,"Actually i went to these museum by accident. People got me wrong direction to national gallery. But, i think its not dissapointed me. A great exhibition there for sgd $10. If you took an mrt from city hall station, you've to walk around 10 minutes"
,,interesting history,4.0,,"we spent a couple of hours visiting this museum , enjoyed the earily singapore history and the changes that have happened over the years to the country"
,,Informative and interesting,5.0,,Well worth a visit lots to see and learn about the history of Sinapore. We spend a couple of hours but could have spent longer.
,,Interesting,4.0,,I visited the NMS during the Singapore Night Festival. It was an interesting historical and cultural insight into Singapore. The night festival had some really amazing light work and some interesting programmes.
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"The national museum of Singapore is very interested,it tells the tale of Singapore when it first started,with raffles,and general Farquhar,through to the second world war ,under occupation of the Japanese,then through to independent of there own,it is set out very good,and it costs only $15 Singapore dollars, definitely recommend this place for children as well"
,,The Making of Modern Singapore,5.0,,"If you are being bored by the city life and would like to opt for something more cultural and human, the National Museum of Singapore is one of the options. It displays how this island country is shaped up throughout the years. There's an entrance fee for foreigners though I found it worthwhile."
,,So nice!,5.0,,Really enjoyed it. Would gibe this museum 5/5. I learned a lot about Singapore and its history. The Glass thing was also very fascinating.
,,Interesting look at Singaporean history,4.0,,"My boyfriend and I set aside around a few hours to go to the museum and enjoyed our visit. We were advised to start upstairs so we could walk down through the interactive forest section, this did make us a bit confused with the order of the information as we jumped through and skipped decades of history. I think starting on the first floor would have been better. The modern history was very interesting seeing how Singapore turned into a booming economy and the building was lovely. My only slight issues were the order we viewed the museum in and also there wasn't much interactivity in most of the sections. A good museum with lots of information but a lot of reading and not much interactivity if you take children."
,,Museum on Singapore,4.0,,"Visit to learn all about Singapore and its development from past to present. Well presented, intriguing, interesting for both kids and adults. Different media are used. The beautiful architecture of the actual museum building makes a visit worthwhile as well.
However, such a museum should be free for all Singapore residents- now it is free for Singaporeans and PRs but not for other residing foreigners."
,,Informative!,4.0,,"Its nice..you get to know about the history of Singapore... Its very well displayed and explained with the help of audio, video and images..I being a teenager enjoyed it...it was fun!"
,,'We built the nation',5.0,,A great national museum which you can explore the history of Singapore. Impressed and touched by the part of Japanese invasion. Asians suffered a lot during that period.
,,Informative history of Singapore,3.0,,"Spent a couple of hours here learning about the history of Singapore. There are five galleries in the main building (four upstairs and one downstairs) which cover different periods of Singapore's history. Start upstairs to go in chronological order. The basement is a kind of whole history so repeats a lot of information from the upstairs galleries.

My favorite sections were the gallery on the first floor (the building of modern Singapore) and a section in the basement which talks about modern Singapore."
,,Well worth it - but Bras Basah is nearest station,4.0,,"Me and my son found the museum fascinating, charting the island's history from early Sultan to British Colonial rule, Japanese occupation during the second world war and Lee Kuan Yew era.
However the reason why doesn't get 5 stars is that, permanent residents get in for free here and unlike London where most of the museum's are free - surely this would benefit Singapore more greatly as tourists would learn about the country's history.
Another point is that the museum has discretely side tracked a important part of start of the country's history in that the outbreaks of the racial riots in 1964 were some of the important contributing factors which led to the eventual separation of Singapore from the Malayan, paving the way for Singapore‚Äôs independence in June 1965."
,,Short Inspiring History!,5.0,,Rather a young country. But the musaeum is proof of the rich heritage that we found so inspiring. Not at all a boring place! Very interesting way of telling the story of Singhapura!
,,‚ù§Ô∏èSingapore Night Festival 2017‚ù§Ô∏è,5.0,,"Beautiful lighting and amazingly art works from 18 August to 26 August , start 730 pm to 12am üôÇ‚úåüèª drop by if u are near by to Bugis , City Hall - along the way u explore different art piece"
,,So much to see and do,5.0,,"I was surprised how many fun exhibits were in the museum, along with beautiful art. Plus, the cafe has a wonderful view of Singapore with good eats."
,,Learning center,5.0,,"Singapore museum is a learning center. History and cultural characteristics of the country are well displayed. It is a place where you can learn the origins of the main 4 races, origin of the name 'singapore', and more. Admission SGD 10"
,,Must do when you visit Singapore,5.0,,"You guys have an amazing and well organized place with so interesting and informative exhibitions. All the staff and friendly and attentive, ticket price are range from 20-25 SGD."
,,"Small, but fine, exhibits, artifacts & displays of history and arts of SIngapore",4.0,,"Though a small museum comparatively, there are some very fine exhibits, artifacts and displays of history and the arts. Particularly interesting for me were the exhibits on the Second World War, the Japanese Occupation, as well as Singapore‚Äôs 700 year history as Singapura, a British Crown Colony (1867), Syonan-To (1942-1945) and finally, following its independence as Singapore."
,,Very interesting but not cheap,5.0,,"Great educational tour of how Singapore came to be. Enough to see for the Children and Adults alike. I'm glad I went and saw it, but not enough to go back. Maybe try get some discount tickets or good deals."
,,Fascinating history,5.0,,"I visited the National Museum with my girlfriend who wasn‚Äòt very keen on visiting some ‚Äûboring museum‚Äú on a sunny day. We ended up staying there for a couple hours, not because I made her to but because it was very interesting and exciting to learn about the history of the still very young country.
The main exhibition about the history is very informative and well made. The ones upstairs focus more on the different decades, the forest I didn‚Äòt understand..."
,,National Childrens' Museum?,3.0,,"This can not be titled a National Museum with these exhibits - very disappointing and vary un-Singaporean! The various time period rooms were just a collection of posters skimming over events, with the WWII time frame totally distorted and uninformative. The ground floor history gallery was a bit better, but a total maze of rooms that had me going round in circles and I'm sure I missed things as a result. Singapore has a large amount of museums covering all sorts of subjects and periods, but visitors tend to head to the National Museum first because of the name, so why not make it a truly National Museum rather than a superficial look at the country. Singapore has such a fabulous history and culture and this needs to be housed under the National banner rather than in numerous other smaller venues."
,,What's it all about?,3.0,,"As an American accustomed to the Smithsonian museums in Washington, D.C., I may be prejudiced, but there just wasn't much here. The galleries on the second floor provided a superficial look at life in Singapore and the one on the World War II years was a particular letdown. Of more interest was the Singapore History Gallery on level one, but I found the layout of that gallery very confusing. The Flutes restaurant displayed a menu of impressive, but expensive Western dishes. Definitely not a must see, but located near Bras Basah and Dhoby Ghaut MRT stations if you go. Admission was Singapore $10 for seniors. Gift shop is on level one. Restrooms on every level."
,,Museum a bit disappointing but lunch was great!,3.0,,"Not a must see but the Flutes restaurant is well worth a visit. The food, wine and service was excellent. The museum itself seemed to lack focus."
,,Quality propaganda,5.0,,"It wasn't until I read The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye that I felt it OK to express this unpopular opinion: The National Museum of Singapore is essentially a well designed, poor veiled, LKY-inspired nationalistic myth maker trying to white wash the indigenous culture of Singapore.

While visiting this beautiful building holding well curated exhibitions, keep in mind the suppression of civil liberties and all the opposition to this monologue who were imprisoned without trial.

And then enjoy The Glass Rotunda! A treat!"
,,Impressive Exhibition,4.0,,"You need to pay $10-15 to visit the museum if you're a tourist, and please queue for tickets on the right side after entering. The exhibition is well-organized with vivid pictures, videos, nice placement and even modern art performance :) On the first floor you can find activities for kids (now is children season theme) and exhibition about Singapore's history. On the second floor you can find The Glass Rotunda which leads you through one nice digital slideshow before coming back to the Historical Exhibition on the 1st floor.
Bonus points: the exhibition on the 2nd floor about childhood and games has an actual game on screen for visitors .Plus,the room about nature allows you to smell the actual fragrance of some trees :D They also utilize the slideshow and interaction techniques to bring items to life in many places!
They have a bit of everything, but don't set your expectation too high. This place will be more suitable to those who love cultures, history and art."
,,A treasure,4.0,,The building alone is worth a visit and just a quality collection of so many things that I can't believe you won't find something of interest. So glad I checked it out
,,Detailed Exhibitions,5.0,,"Locals and permanent residents have free admission, while tourists have to pay $10 to $15. The Glass Rotunda on Level 2 has stunning arts exhibitions, namely the ‚ÄúStory of the Forest‚Äù digital installation by teamLab that brings drawings of rainforests to life, as well as the ‚ÄúSingapore, Very Old Tree‚Äù photography showcase by Robert Zhao that features Singaporeans‚Äô personal stories with trees. The Glass Rotunda leads visitors down to the Singapore History Gallery on Level 1, with detailed exhibitions and an array of artefacts telling Singapore‚Äôs history. There are also other galleries in the museum. Visitors can easily spend 2 to 3 hours at the National Museum of Singapore. I recommend history buffs to visit the National Museum of Singapore and Battlebox in the same day, as they are both located in the Fort Canning area."
,,Great way to learn about Singapore history,4.0,,"If you're from out of the country, you'll be paying for a more expensive ticket compared to some who will get a free ticket. Overall, it's a pretty small museum (compared to other national museums I've been to), but it's a good way to walk through the timeline and changes in Singapore."
,,Well set out,4.0,,The Museum has a number of areas and it well set out. I particularly liked seeing the old toys. Entrance is reasonable and the museum is spacious so school groups do nbot interfere with the enjoyment of the visit.
,,Very Interesting,4.0,,"A great way to spend the morning . We had a fantastic guide who really knew her history and made the tour a fun way to learn about the history of Singapore , it is well worth visiting the museum."
,,A Very Good Museum,5.0,,The National Museum of Singapore is one of the top class museums that I have visited. The museum does a very good job of portraying the history of Singapore and also has a lot of information on present day Singapore. Definitely worth visiting if one wants to make the most of visit to Singapore.
,,Very Good Displays of Local and Natural History,5.0,,"The museum is situated in Stamford Street and is just over the road from Bras Basah MRT station.

There was a nice display of local flora and fauna in the Glass Rotunda, but I was more interested in the pictures of trees taken in various spots throughout the island and their significance to the local community.

I enjoyed very much the displays relating to the period just before the Second World War, the Japanese Occupation and its aftermath, and the time before and after the creation of the independent state of Singapore.

There was a recreation of the drive in movie park that was very popular in the Seventies and the footage of the legendary Cleopatra Wong was a delight to behold.

I spent a good three hours looking around and the admission fee was SIN$15."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Spent an interesting afternoon looking through this informative museum that summarised Singapore's rich history.
,,Well worth visiting,5.0,,The National Museum of Singapore gives you a great understanding of Singapore's history in an interesting and informative way. The displays were all well presented and easy to navigate and there appeared to be good activities for children as well. Don't miss the Story of the Forest in the glass rotunda.
,,Only for people interested in Singapore history,4.0,,It gives lot of information about the history of Singapore. From the time of their first king to British colonisation and Independence. It has refreshment zone too
,,Good overview,5.0,,"We spent a couple of hours in the museum focusing on the Singapore parts. The exhibit on the ground level was very well done, interesting and entertaining. On the upper floor we spent some time in the ""living in Singapore section"", and found this to be very informative, too.

Don't forget to go to the ""battlebox"", about 5 minutes away."
,,Excellent overview of the history of Singapore,4.0,,We did not have time to visit all the exhibitions but spent our time in the main exhibition - the history of Singapore. Very well laid out with an impressive amount of facts presented in different ways. Been to Singapore many times but learned so much in a few hours. The Cafe is also very pleasant.
,,Informative and well presented,4.0,,Being a self confessed museum junkie I just had to visit it and was not disappointed. The exhibition about the history of Singapore was well laid out and informative. Children activities were interesting and well thought out.
,,Building was the best bit,3.0,,Felt this place wasn't much of an actual museum they have a 3 D type room which is relaxing. Only go if it's raining there are better things to do in Singapore. Loved the architecture.
,,One of the best museums I have visited,5.0,,"The museum ticket is a little heavy on your pocket but definitely worth it. It is very well organised and easy to browse through. Each section of the museum is very well displayed and their short movies on various topics are very interesting. You can easily spend 3-4 hours here. The Singapore history and its rise as a finance hub is demonstrated extremely well. By the end of it, you will fall in love with Singapore much more."
,,Awesome galleries and restaurants to relax,5.0,,Went with my mum who is 72 but very mobile. We spent 6 hours looking at galleries or enjoying a coffee. In the end we finished with a small bite of food and drinks at the bar on the roof. A generally amazing afternoon and a great venue to spend time and chat with my mum
,,Brilliant display,5.0,,"I spent hours here, taking in the history of Singapore from its earliest inception to current times.
Beatifully set out, meticulous in detail, it is one of the best things I have done in Singapore, and leaves you with a sense of how Singapore developed the pride it justifiably has in itself.
A must visit for locals and visitors."
,,Very very nice way to spend a day,5.0,,"The history of Singapore told through lovely detailed displays. Beautifully laid out. We spent 6 hours there, well worth the $15 entry."
,,Family fun at NMS,5.0,,"My husband, 2 year old daughter and I visited here on our first day in Singapore and would definitely recommend it. Entry is $15 but there are currently 2 pop up children's areas which were very good for our daughter. The section on the history of Singapore was extremely informative and both my husband and I learned quite a lot.
Our daughter had lunch in the cafe and the food was good. All in all well worth a visit."
,,Very good!,5.0,,"As far as museums go, this is a gem. The presentation of the history of Singapore is actually very interesting. And there is the Flower Dome! Truly special experience. Highly recommended."
,,Don't Miss this Excellent Museum,5.0,,This museum is fantastic and worth a visit. They have a nice cafe and wonderful exhibits that tell the story of Singapore.
,,SEA's repository of the arts,5.0,,"Very extensive museum in terms of showcasing the arts of the region. I saw paintings of Philippine art luminaries like Damian Domingo, Juan Luna, BenCab, Amorsola, Anita Magsaysay Ho, Malang, Botong Francisco etc, all in one place. The museum traces the development of visual arts in the ASEAN. Really, really worth the effort, time and money.
If you are into the arts, I advice you to give the place a day or even two to explore."
,,Excellent Museum,5.0,,Great collection and good diverse and factual content. Kids spaces and brilliant art installation. I could go back and get more out of it.
,,The exhibits on the first floor were interesting,3.0,,I found the exhibits on the ground floor to be boring. You can only see so many pieces of broken china and look at so many paintings. The exhibit on the first floor however were interesting. I enjoyed looking back at life in Singapore in the 1920' s-until 1970's. That was worth the price of admission.
,,Wonderful experience!!,5.0,,"We had a very special experience at this Museum. The history of Singapore exhibits were excellent - interesting and well presented. Top of the day (and our whole week in Singapore) was The World of the Forest. Wow! This light, sound and smell experience catered to all the senses with falling opening flowers from the dome that you could smell, accompanied by beautiful music and birdsounds. Such an all encompassing experience we had to go through twice and spent a long time on the beanbags watching the images of animals (taken from colonial drawings) change and interact in the ""Forest"". Just unbelievable - don't miss it."
,,great place,5.0,,"Nice spot to find about some of Singapore history , including war history . Allow at least 3 or 4 hrs."
,,wonderful,5.0,,"If you enjoy museums, than this is very interesting.Well laid out and the very place to learn the history of this beautiful city.Worth a visit!"
,,Nice building needs more contents,2.0,,"It is a nice architecture building worth for photography. I visited the Singapore history section, good information but found the lighting on the exhibits were too dimmed and difficult to read the texts. Ratio of eating places versus exhibits seem a little high as compared to other museums."
,,Great exhibition,5.0,,i didn't know what to expect from this visit but I was blown away by the quality of the artworks. The conceptual works were far above those I have seen elsewhere and those demanding a more craft based side were excellent.
,,Great museum in a great building,4.0,,We spent a good 2.5 hours pottering around this museum and still didn't see it all. Lots about pre and post WWII Singapore.
,,Good for the history buff,3.0,,Maybe a little boring for very young child. But the food was good and it was great to learn some of the history of Singapore.
,,Bigger than it looks,4.0,,"Kind of like Singapore itself, its small but packs a punch. Singapore only has 200 years or so of history, but they manage to fill a ton of rooms with facts and figures. They also have (currently) a ""Life to Tree"" exhibition that is bascially a psychodelic light show. Very bizarre. But toddlers seem to like it.
I would budget at least 2-3 hours for this."
,,If you want to learn history of Singapore visit this,5.0,,I enjoyed my visit to the museum since I am keen to learn about singapore history. They present it well. Try to join the guided tour which is free. Guide will explain minor details of the exhibits which is very interesting. There are Lee Kuan Yew's speeches gallery and one can spend whole day listening to this great leader.
,,I wish I was given a warning on closing time of certain galleries,4.0,,"A very interactive, creative,innovative museum. You can spend a good 4 hours there and still missed the chance to visit some galleries that closed at 6:15pm instead of the normal 7pm. The outdoor terrace cafe is very beautiful but also closed by 7pm"
,,Great Museum,5.0,,"Great museum, we got to experience art, technology, history and current data on Singapore all in 2 hours.
Very good museum for both kids and adults.
We had no line to buy tickets, so that was pleasant.
The glass center on the 4th level has a technology exhibition with forest as a theme that was truly magical to experience.
They have kids season at the moment, so there were a couple of extra children's sections that explained all the different ""worlds"" that come together in Singapore.
The history section was very well presented. Many different kinds of exhibits made the visit interesting and dynamic."
,,A great general overview of Singapore,4.0,,"We visited he National Museum on the first day of our stay, and found it to be a very enjoyable and interesting start to our holiday, giving us a good general overview of the history of Singapore and its development over the past couple of hundred years. We would recommend this as a good start for anyone exploring Singapore for the first time."
,,Brilliant experience,5.0,,"We took a group of 9 (4xA & 5xC) and found this had something for everyone. The building alone is stunning, but the displays inside are fantastic. Learnt so much about the early days of Singapore and the years of Japanese occupation. All done in a way that is not confrontational for children but detailed enough to educate. The pictures from old Singapore were probably my highlight. Spent a solid 4 hours in here and loved it."
,,"So informative, relaxed and insightful",4.0,,"We found the refreshing strategies used to convey the story of Singapore very colourful and easy to follow. They are justly proud of their achievements, their inclusive society and anxious to share their goals and experiences of their journey in a way that is appealing to all ages. It was a great day and their use of the space excellent. Staff very helpful"
,,Always learn something,4.0,,"I have visited this Museum a number of times and while there is a slow turnover of the exhibitions, there is always something to learn and admire."
,,"A great explanation of the ""Singapore Story""",5.0,,"Singapore's history - for such a small place in world terms - is remarkably varied. From the Malay princes through to Chinese traders, Indian migrants, Stamford Raffles, two World Wars, a brief union with Malaysia and the shiny modern metropolis of today, there's a lot to take in. Thankfully, the National Museum does a very good job of this.

The main gallery is the absolute key here. It starts with pre-history and gradually steps the visitor through every important piece of the story, with good amounts of focus on the key players - Raffles, of course, but also figures of high local importance like Tan Tock Seng and Omar al-Junied, who perhaps aren't as well-known outside of the island.
As well as the customary collection of exhibits behind glass, there are also some audio-visual elements, including a rather over-acted video detailing Raffles' machinations in claiming Singapore for London, and some reminiscences of locals describing the smell of the Singapore River in the 1960s (one of these is delivered in very thick Singlish, and could almost benefit from a translation).

The split from Malaysia is described - naturally from the Singaporean side of that dispute - and this time around I even saw the original television appearance of the teary Lee Kuan Yew announcing that momentous piece of news, which I didn't remember from a previous visit.

There are a couple of other significant museums to visit elsewhere in Singapore - the various Heritage Centres for the three major ethnic groups provide very important pieces of the story as well - but this should be on everyone's itinerary if they're interested in understanding the whys and wherefores of this remarkable little country."
,,A most professional history museum,5.0,,"The story of Singapore unfolds as you walk through the dimly lit National Museum. Like many museums it is a quiet place but is filled with information and displays on the many people who have contributed to making Singapore what it is today. travelling in time from the early settlers and the eventual British involvement gives a good understanding of how Singapore has become the multi-cultural hub it is today.
The building itself is exceptionally well maintained and provides a glimpse of colonial times.
There is an entry fee but don't be put off by this - the experience is well worth the cost.
The forest display is another not to miss. the domed theatre is used to project images of thousands of flowers falling with occasional comets passing through. Certainly one your children would love almost as much as you will.
I would personally give the museum restaurant a miss as service is incredibly slow and staff could be described as disinterested at best.
When you finish take a walk through the nearby Fort Canning Park for more history and some great gardens (again give the food here a miss)"
,,A must for those interested in history,4.0,,We only spent a couple of hours here and managed to get on to one of the free tours. The one hour tour gave us an excellent understanding of the fascinating history of the area. The many interactive exhibits tell the story in a way that will hold the interest of even those with only a modest interest in the history of Singapore and its people.
,,History lesson.,5.0,,I enjoyed my visit to the Museum. The displays are modern and fun and provide an easy way to learn about the history of Singapore.
,,"History Gallery, Surviving Syonan are the best parts",4.0,,"The most interesting and informative part of the museum is the Singapore History Gallery, whose nature is fairly self-explanatory. The Gallery presents a very good trail from the very beginnings of Singapore through its development as a British colony, through to the modern era. The exhibits are well-presented and educational, and we can thoroughly recommend the one hour guided tour (ours began at 11:00 a.m. but call for other times). Coming a close second to the History Gallery is the 'Surviving Syonan' exhibit on the second floor, which illustrates what life was like under the Japanese occupation of 1942-45. The other exhibits on the second floor such as 'Growing Up' and 'Modern Colony' are far less interesting and could easily be skipped by those facing time pressure."
,,Awesome architecture and great exhibitions,5.0,,"If only just for the amazing architectural feat that is the refurbishment and conversion of these two former British colonial time buildings into a museum, it is a must-see. On top of that it features world-class exhibitions, I personally went to see Yayoi Kusama and Singapore efficiency made it a very pleasant visit, despite the crowds, thanks to the timed entry concept. Don't miss it even if you are normally not into museums. The roof garden, walking around the library dome, the bridge linking the top floors, all quite extraordinary if you think that they were two separate official buildings a couple of years ago. A bit reminiscent, concept-wise, of the British Museum."
,,Really worthwhile and insightful.,5.0,,A thoroughly brilliant museum - inside and out. We spent the last two hours before closing quickly whipping around the exhibitions which are brilliant - the right level of detail and very professionally presented. I feel so much more informed on the history of Singapore now. The rotunda was also mesmerising - not to be missed. Definitely do this if visiting Singapore.
,,Great history lesson of Singapore,5.0,,"Raining outside do the museum was a good place to visit. It is quite a large museum with much to see so very glad we took advantage of s guided tour (no extra charge). The gentleman who took the tour was a very pleasant person with a very good knowledge of Singapores history. We learnt so much about Singapore that we were never new, much more than we learnt at school or from history books, it was a great experience. Highly recommend the museum and taking the tour with a guide."
,,Not so interesting exhibition,4.0,,Many exhibition here but for us as a tourist the exhibition is not interesting. The exhihition related to history of singapore.
,,Start your Singapore trip with this museum,5.0,,"The main building is in colonial style. The modern part of the museum is wrapped around the old one and create a stunning combination of modern and traditional. It's an excellent way to start discovering Singapore as it has a very detailed exhibition on the country's history.
The entry fee is S$15 for adults and includes all exhibitions. It's open everyday from 10 to 19h. Last entry at 18:30.
Enjoy !"
,,So much fun for the whole family,5.0,,"We went to learn the history of Singapore and came out with much more enriched experience than we expected. It is a place ideal for the whole family. there are areas for the kids to explore, to sense, to touch, to play and to learn. There are IMAX experience to see the flowers, there are bitter past history with present vigorous growing path. Singapore is one of the four most fast growing countries in Asia. With all the high rises around the city and fast paced life, I can feel the heart beat of this city through the visit of the museum."
,,So much to see!,5.0,,"Like so many museums, the National Museum of Singapore is vast with so much to see. We spent a good half day in the museum and barely scratched the surface of all the exhibits available. It is absolutely fascinating and we took advantage of a guided tour (free) to ensure that we saw some of themore important parts of the museum. Highly recommended especially when it's wet outside! There is an entry charge but seniors (over 60's) get a discount!"
,,Worth more than 5 stars,5.0,,"Museums are boring? - When I think of museums my mind usually pictures rows of dusty exhibits in long cold silent halls well not so in this wonderful place ‚Äì this museum is a living tribute to Singapore from its early beginnings under Malay Sultans 700 years ago, then a Crown Colony, Japanese occupation in the 1940‚Äôs and post war struggles to the great Independent country it is today. There are a number of specific theme Galleries on the top floor with static displays, Video‚Äôs and Sound bites presented in a vibrant and interesting manner ‚Äì enter the Story of the Forest at the top of the Rotunda and be amazed at the audio digital presentations in the entrance room and as you descend a circular ramp against the wall there is another digital masterpiece of a living forest depicting animated William Farquhar natural history drawings ‚Äì the finale is a darkened dome illuminated by a kaleidoscope of colors as a forest grows around you ‚Äì stunning ‚Äì this leads into a comprehensive exhibition concentrating on Singapore life over the past 100 years ‚Äì entrance was S$15 for adults with a concession for seniors over 60 at S$10 ‚Äì worth every cent ‚Äì you need quite a lot of time to enjoy it all ‚Äì there is a pleasant restaurant for you to take a break ‚Äì if this is not on your to do list it should be."
,,A Good Family Excursion,4.0,,"Brought the kids here to know more about our own history. The Museum provides a positive experience to tour the exhibits, which were nicely done up, in tasteful displays. Informative and good learning experience for the children as well. It is free for Singaporeans, which makes it even more of waste for Singaporeans who did not make this trip."
,,Very well presented,5.0,,"We have been to the History Gallery as well as to ""Growing up"" and ""We Build a Nation"" - all very interesting and well presented."
,,Singapore's history,5.0,,Each time I visit Singapore the first place I go to is the National Museum to see the changes in their exhibits. It was during school holidays this time when I visited and I was not disappointed as there was an exhibition showing 100 years of history and I was in my element to read through as much as I could on its history through the years in different exhibits such as 1920s - 1930 - 1940s the 1950 - 1970s a time when I remember visiting Singapore for the first time in 1973; how different Singapore was back then and to see the photographs of that era brought back many happy memories. For children there was an exhibition on 'the animated forest' filled with colour and wonder to young eyes and to older eyes as well; the digital animation brought to life animals of the forest much to the delight of the children who were there enjoying the changes of scenery as much as I was. Singapore's National Museum is a must for visiting especially for those who love history. Unfortunately for me I did not have enough time to spend there as I like too; there is so much to absorb.
,,"Nice Building, but Boring Exhibition",3.0,,"The building is beautiful. The exhibition inside is about the history of Singapore, and I personally feel that it is a bit boring."
,,Terrible,1.0,,"No need to visit their as a Tourist. It will be complete wastage of money. If you are living in Singapore for long time , then you can visit. Apart from 2-3 items all bogus. You can see those in your house only. Like Black-White TV, Eveready Battery, old radio etc."
,,Equisite Museum,5.0,,"2012 Totally enjoyable visit to this National Treasure with my family. The staff were efficient, friendly and helpful. All the exhibits were a wonderful step in time. We will definately be back on our next fling with Singapore!"
,,Top experience,5.0,,"I really liked the Museum. The Story starts in 15th centra And leads until contemporary events. Not overloaded with information, very cool!!!"
,,Don't miss this museum-provides a great history tour of Singapore,5.0,,You can easily spent half a day- a whole day here learning about the history of Singapore. Join one of the free tours run by very knowledgable volunteer guides; you get a much better and personalised glimpse into Singapores past.
,,Singapore's oldest museum,5.0,,Explored the museum during January 2017. It is a splendid layout that boasted high visual impact. Spent few hours exploring each level and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Definitely a good soothing experience.
,,One of the best,5.0,,"I work in the museum sector and have studied a wide range of exhibitions, and I'm struggling to think of a better experience. The displays were of an incredible quality, the staff were helpful, the interactives were experimental, and the facilities were spotless. An excellent visit."
,,Down memory Lane,4.0,,I spent a few years of my childhood in Malaysia. This museum provided memories of my arrival and the cultural shock of a child in leaving Australia to live in Asia. The explanation of Independence was great and something I did not know. Also the more human stories of the Japanese occupation were done really well. I really enjoyed this museum.
,,Learn the History and Culture of Singapore,5.0,,"This is an amazing place to learn about the history and culture of Singapore. Housed in a historic building itself, the National Museum of Singapore also hosts other exhibits that are worth seeing. There are guided tours that you can avail at the entrance when you buy the ticket, or you can also just walk along and read the inscriptions."
,,Fascinating education on the history of Singapore!!,5.0,,I thought I would spend 1 or 2 hours in the Museum and ended up spending almost 5 hours going through the exhibits. Its very well laid out and very interesting. The exhibits might be a little much for kids as it does take a lot of reading and almost no interactive exhibits. There are free tours for the first part of the exhibits which are well worth listening to. The building is also beautiful which adds to the experience. There is also a nice cafe there for refreshments or break during the exhibits.
,,"Good visit, slightly off the beaten tourist path",4.0,,"Visiting the National Museum during children's season. They have a variety of fun, educational activities for children. And a giant trampoline at the entrance. Better to send children here alone else the wait is longer. All in all, 1-2 hours spent here is well spent."
,,"Not only for history learning, but also aesthetic appreciation",5.0,,"They are now having an exhibition designed by a Japanese firm, teamLab, in the glass rotunda, which is STUNNING! You will experience a spiral down path with a view of forrest, which leads you down to a small room to experience a ""shower of flowers"" by lying down on the floor. This is a time limited exhibition, so do check it out.
And you will also see bottles of different plants found in Fort Canning Park, which is next to the museum. The room with these bottle is also beautiful. Shelves were made of concrete blocks and there are sufficient bottles for visitors to smell. Staff there were also very helpful! And you will have a long walk of history about Singapore, which is so detailed not only its history, but also their ways of presentation.
As it is now Children's season, children can also experience and learn in the museum! It is much appreciated!
There is fine dining option, and casual dining. We chose the casual one and tried their Laksa Egg Benedict, which is a fun to try. It worths a visit!"
,,Magical and Historical,5.0,,"I was just walking in the busy streets of singapore when i passed by the national museum, when i went inside i was enchanted and was taken back time. :)"
,,Lots to learn even with toddler in tow.,5.0,,You can spend up to 2 hours there. The exhibits are separated in a way. Quick history lesson presented in an interesting way. Stroller friendly.
,,Do it.,5.0,,You won't regret the experience and discovery of the museum which will open your eyes to the history of the country.
,,Historical museum in classic style,4.0,,"Easy to visit the museum by MRT (suggest to walk from City Hall station via Stamford Road). There are some permanent exhibitions there. If you have interest in World War II history, recommend you to visit ""Surviving Syonan 1942 - 1945""."
,,Learn the history of Singapore. Take advantage of the guided tours presented live .,5.0,,We thought we would spend an hour and ended up spending almost 3. Exhibits and galleries were presented in many interesting ways that demonstrate how Singapore developed. Material is more adult in nature but enough exhibits for children to keep them interested. Easy to reach by public transit.
,,Well worth a visit.........,5.0,,Check out the history of Singapore. Many interesting displays for adults and children and a fascinating place to visit. There is more to Singapore than eating and shopping.
,,Make this your first stop!,5.0,,"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the National Museum. I spent a total of 6.5 hours there! I enjoyed every bit of it, everything I learned and everything I wished I had more time to carefully read. The exhibition is really well curated and the museum very well taken care of. The only suggestion I have is to add more seats throughout the galleries. I was standing so much that I simply had to rush through the ""Singapore Lifestyle"" galleries because of the back pain. Please add more seats, especially next to the audio story booths."
,,Highlight of the trip,5.0,,"A renovated City Hall and Supreme Court which also houses the Declaration of Independence among lots of local paintings. Set aside 3 hrs for it, could have taken more. What a restoration. Take train to City Hall and a short stroll (under cover) from there. For Singaporean, pre-booked ticket online. Visitors get discount if can present KrisFlyer (Singapore airline) frequent flyer."
,,Day at thet museum,4.0,,"Housed in an iconic colonial building, the museum is an architectural delight, affording vistas to satisfy the avid photographer's compositions. The museum hoses important artifacts pertaining to Singapore, Malaya, and regional collections that depict the history of this part of the world."
,,A wonderful place to spend an afternoon immersed in Singapore history,5.0,,"A well-curated museum with well-thought out concepts for bringing the museum experience to you in a immersive way. My family and I always enjoyed our visits to the National Museum, most recently in April 2017."
,,Educational exhibits,4.0,,"There are main exhibits that remains the same throughout the year, but special exhibits with different themes are always being put up. Prepare to go with a full battery on your smartphone or camera and bring along a fully charged portable charger (preferably with a capacity between 15600 to 20000mA) and a cable when your camera or smartphone runs out juice from too much photo taking."
,,State-of-the-art,5.0,,"Frequent exhibitions are held here. If you are travelling during some festivals like Singapore Night Festival or Art Festival, special events may be held inside and outside the museum. It's located downtown and the trip to the museum is quite easy. Just cross two streets, there is Singapore Art Museum. If you like spending time in museums, Singapore is the right place to come."
,,Everything you need to know about Singapore,5.0,,This is a place you will learn everything about Singapore's History. You will leave like a true Singaporean with all the knowledge and cultural experience you gained from this place. Truly Amazing.
,,"Interesting visit, great to learn about Singapore's history",4.0,,"A pretty great museum. Enjoyed reading about the turbulent and fascinating history of Singapore. Great way to spend my time before a flight out. The cafe there is not so good though (very poor service, expensive)."
,,Newly updated-great spaces,5.0,,Great introduction to Spore history and culture. The front building has some smaller exhibits but the back add-on is totally new with big tall soaring spaces and interesting dioramas that takes you through the interesting history of Spore from water culture to modern day... Great place to start your visit.
,,Surprisingly well curated,4.0,,"I went for an exhibition and professor talk which was really well organised and had a houseful. After the exhibition, I got a chance to have a look at the exhibits which were very well curated. I think the museum isn't well-known enough and not popular yet due to limited information and tourist visitors but is now gaining popularity. Spotless clean, amazing staff and amazing artefacts."
,,do this one first,5.0,,"such a well done museum (as are some of the other ones) but this puts a lot of the history into context. We spent over 5 hours here. We learned so much about the times before the British, the British, the Malay states, why Singapore left the Malay states, and how the have accomplished the economic miracle that is today's Singapore.
There was a free tour available as well - which we took - that was well done and very informative.
My only negative comment is that an audio guide would be good."
,,Tourism,4.0,,This is a must in your visit to Singapore . You can travel in time and get amazed for the determination of a country to excel
,,Jaw dropping,5.0,,My experience there is awesome. Inside the museum is very very grand and spotless clean. The staff are accommodating. Then I used to walk in their connecting bridge that help me conquer my fear of heights. Its my second time visiting National Gallery of Singapore but still I'm always enchanted by its beauty.
,,Museum Visit,4.0,,Well worth a visit whilst in Singapore. We had a volunteer museum guide who took us through the main exhibit.
,,Great museum,5.0,,"Good museum, informative and interactive. Allow at least 2 hours for your visit and perhaps combine with visit to other attractions close by"
,,nothing special...,3.0,,In a quiet area with several parks and easy access with nearby metro station. It's not impressive if you do not want to pay the ticket just take some photos ...
,,Interesting history of Singapore,4.0,,"The museum has a great location, and is a nice building. The history given of Singapore is very well told with a lot of nice artifacts. 15$ entry is not too bad.
Not too crowded. Have some dining options with coffee and light food at reasonable prices. All in all worth a visit.
We went to the National Museum, and then to the battle box on Fort Canning for a guided tour."
,,Brilliant layout taking you through Singapore's history,4.0,,This was an excellent start to our visit to Singapore. We learned a great deal about how Singapore came to be. The layout is attractive and the history fascinating
,,Awesome job of capturing the history of Singapore !,4.0,,"We had kept only an hour or so for this place but trust me there is enough to keep you occupied for at least half a day here. Especially if you are one of those who take interest in the history of a place. I guess most seasoned travelers are and the thorough job they have done here needs to be appreciated.

Right from a maritime chart that shows Simha pura (Original Sanskrit name of Singapore) on the ancient sea lanes to capturing the lifestyle of the Chettiars from South India who shaped the financial business, you will find a wealth of minor details that help you understand modern Singapore.

They have used a combination of different media - Interesting audio visuals that are mapped onto sprawling screens, recreated interiors of a house and collection of World War II memorabilia - suffice it to say that they have succeeded in transporting you through the journey Singapore has made to evolve as a favourite hub of modern international commerce.

Housed in an elegant building, there is even a restaurant here so that you can stay on if you desire to.

If you are not one of those history buffs, you can breeze through in about 30 minutes as there are only 4 large halls that need to be traversed."
,,Quite intresting,5.0,,"A time travel experience in this amazing museum. It shows you the developing of Singapore through the years. Absolute a must see, when visiting this metropol in Asia."
,,Very informative,5.0,,I learnt a lot about the history of Singapore presented in a very interesting way right up to present day
,,The changed exhibit is wonderful,5.0,,"We went to the National Museum of Singapore for my husband's birthday. We thought it would be the same as when we saw it years ago. We were pleasantly surprised that they changed most of the exhibit. The museum still has an interesting way to showcase how Singapore became independent, however, it also now gives a fabulous fanciful highlight of Singapore's natural landscape. We absolutely loved our experience there."
,,Great place to learn about the history of Singapore,4.0,,It was 15 dollars for non Singaporeans and 10 if you are a student. I enjoyed my stay there but the content was quite limited. However I definitely think it's worth the entrance fees and a nice stop to visit during the hot summer tines as a break from all the outdoor tourist attractions.
,,Introduction to Singaporean History 101,5.0,,After visiting the museum you get an idea about why and how this island evolved into this first world country: from singapore stone to Raffles. From merger to expelsion...
,,Real history of Singapore and much more,5.0,,"The overall experience of visiting the museum was excellent ,Level one is extremely well laid out to give the visitor a potted history of the origins of Singapore On level two we visited the glass rotunda with its digital interpretation of the forest , please do not miss the experience, a credit to the museum and its contributors"
,,Worth a History Lesson,5.0,,I had some time to kill and decided to visit the museum. One could spend hours here with a well thought out layout of scenes and history of Singapore. I was quite surprised by the quality of the exhibits and the most descriptive commentary. Some interesting facts were gleaned by my visit and i would encourage those with an inclination to understand cities they visit. It is a sleeper but if you have the time and patience you will not be disappointed.
,,Interactive and quick to visit,5.0,,This interactive museum can be visited within 2 hours in order to get a good idea of the history of Singapore. It is pleasantly visited by children as well.
,,A spontaneous visit,5.0,,It is great... I have never seen a museum put tgether like this. You can watch films on the history of parks n Singapore in a 'drive through cinema' and every exhibit is interactive in some way
,,Nice afternoon,5.0,,"we spent few hours at this museum with our kids. The building architecture is great. The living wall is really beautiful, the part regarding the history of Singapore is really interesting. A very pleasant moment."
,,Awesome way to learn about their culture!,5.0,,This is the perfect place to learn about the Singapore culture.

,,Interesting history of Singapore,4.0,,"This museum offers a variety of exhibits on Singapore history from the early pre-colonial, through British rule and later independence and the development of modern Singapore.

Other exhibitions change on a regular basis so there is always something new to explore."
,,Learning the history of Singapore,4.0,,The Singapore National Museum is an excellent place to learn the history of the country. The exhibits were very detailed and chronicled over 200 years of history.
,,Great insight into Singapores history,5.0,,"This museum offers a detailed and informative insight into how Singapore became the glorious city it is today! It tells you the number of invasions the city has dealt with, how the government dealt with public infrastructure problems, the housing system, the varieties of ethnicities that have made Singapore their home and many other things I do not remember. I was amazed at how detailed the exhibits were and how interesting it was to learn about Singapores evolution. I highly recommend a visit to this place!"

,,An amazing overview of Singapore's history.,5.0,,"I've travelled to Singapore many times but only visited the National Museum on my last trip - I'm glad I made the time and would recommend it to tourists or business travellers who have never bothered.

Set in a beautiful building and grounds, the exhibits cover the history of the region going back several hundred years, Singapore's role in World War 2 and culminate with the story of Singapore's journey to independence, it's cultural development and how it became the economic powerhouse of SE Asia.

There is a small entrance fee for foreign nationals but it is definitely worth spending the money."
,,Looking for the BattleBox and found this first!,4.0,,"We had been advised to visit the BattleBox and while we were on our way we saw this museum so thought we would check it out. Fascinating museum with many interesting exhibits. A beautiful building , walking around is a delight , with so much information we could have stayed longer. E were advised to leave by the back door on the third floor to access the BattleBox."
,,"Great place to explore Singapore in the past, and experience the technologies",4.0,,"The places was a must visit when you come to Singapore!
They had fascinating exhibitions from the life of the citizen and the history of the country. The nice things was black dome room with LED and lights for making night jungle effect! You can take a nap inside hehe.

,,understanding the history of singapore,4.0,,show-casing Singapore development for the past 700 years. the period of japan invasion was always being forgotten. suggest to join the free tour guide.
,,Beautiful building with very comprehensive display of Singapore history.,5.0,,"We spent two hours here and could have easily spent more. Detailed displays recounting the history of Singapore. Really worth going up to the second level where we were entranced by the moving crystal ""chandelier"" - and then to the Glass Rotunda with a magical display spiralling down to the ground floor. Could have gone through again but time did not allow."
,,Impressive,4.0,,The museum has a fascinating exhibition detailing the interesting history and development of Singapore into the impressive city state that it now is. You can use your Singapore Air boarding pass to get a discount at this venue.
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"A great showing of Singapores history, very informative, but not a huge museum. Takes an 11/2 hrs to go around worth the time if you are interested in the origin and establishment of Singapore"
,,Excellent museum which gives insight in to the history of the country with some great displays,4.0,,"Very happy we visited this place as we knew little, to nothing about the history of Singapore. The displays were interesting and informative and well-presented. The museum itself was not intuitive but is quite pleasant to wander around and enjoy."
,,Excellent museum,4.0,,Excellent museum showing the history of Singapore as well as some contemporary art. Loved the glass rotunda.
,,If you have an hour to spend. Not a standout,3.0,,Great architecture. A nice cafe for a break. Not outstanding for the region and printed materials very limited.
,,Educational and interactive,4.0,,"The whole city is amazing and this museum is not an exception, lets you get a glance of the history behind Singapur and experience a couple of exhibitions that use technology to transmit a sensorial experience"
,,Uncover Singapore's history,5.0,,The building is reminiscent of London's National Art Gallery on the outside. Inside it has great exhibitions of Singapore from when it was first settled by Westerners. We got a great understanding of its history from the paintings
,,Tourist,5.0,,I visited the National Museum of Singapore with a friend. It was a really amazing experience. We learnt so much about the history of Singapore. The video of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew announcing the independence of Singapore was really moving. He truly made Singapore the amazing city it is now.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Our visit here far exceeded our expectations. The exhibits were well displayed and very modern with interactive elements. The museum provides an incredibly interesting history of the evolution of Singapore into the success of a nation it is today. Highly recommend a visit here.
,,Start here if you are in Singapore for more than a weekend,5.0,,"This museum is beautiful. The main gallery which describes the nations history is very well presented. If you are staying in Singapore for a little while and wish to understand the community before you see all of the various sites I would highly recommend it.

Tip - go in the afternoon when it's probably raining out"
,,Great way to spend a few hours when a rain storm hits,5.0,,"Really great Museum, when it rains in Singapore it pours and this is a great place to spend 2/3 hours. This is a fantastic building and reminds me of some of the great Museums in London"
,,Boring and basic,2.0,,"We usually love museums. But this was boring and basic! Firstly you line up to buy a ticket but you can not see the prices until you get to the desk. This wastes people time as no one is prepared. They layout is not great. You enter the first level and follow that floor plan around then you go upstairs to the second level only to end up back on the first floor in the first exhibition you started with and then you have to re exit that one and go back upstairs to continue. If you knew about this you would start right at the top and work your way down.
Personally we learnt and appreciated more of Singapore history at our tourist attractions.

What was great was the architecture of the building. Stunning! That gets 10/10!

The cafe there was ridiculous. We waiting for 15 minutes at our table and got ignored so we decided to get up and order. Only to be told we had to sit down for our order to be taken. So we sat down for a further 15 minutes. Didn't get served so we left.

If you had children you will be very sorry you take them here! They will be bored to death"
,,National museum of Singapore,4.0,,Gives you a great insight into how Singapore came into and what all went through in the past centuries and how they achieved the present day status. There was a one hour guided tour at 11:00 which was very interesting and informative. There is so much to see and the best way would be to go on a guided tour first and then go back to see in detail and also go through the galleries and glass rotunda that are not covered in the tour. You can spend around three hours here. There is a restaurant to take a break in between.
,,Loved it,5.0,,"Had a fantastic guide (guided tours are free)...she spoke of the building's history when it was the Supreme Court. They have done a great job of preserving the integrity of the older parts of the building and making it a state of the art, art gallery. The local art works are brilliant.
Views of the bay from the Deck Floor (6th floor) are fantastic."
,,Great place for learn history,5.0,,The location might hard to find but when you arrive there I promise that you will have a good time there because there are many interest info for tourist to go and understand how Singapore become from their past till now.
,,Great for both adults and kids,4.0,,"Never think that my lttitle kid loves this place so much! Special designed corner for kids available, it's colourful, full of fun and awesome."
,,I love all museums,4.0,,Located in a stately colonial building simply adds to the wealth that can be found when walking around this museum. The exibits change regularly so it a place than become a regular go to location.
,,Revelational,5.0,,"We often include a national level museum or two when visiting a country and this is one of the better museums of its kind. It covers very local as well as whole of Asia themes and does it very well. We spent most of the morning there but were planning to leave to have lunch somewhere. What a mistake that would have been! The cafe on site was excellent and there was an upscale lunch and dinner venue as well if that suits you. What an excellent visit we had and if you have a couple of young ones in tow, they may just enjoy it..."
,,Great Place to know Singapore History,4.0,,We really enjoyed our museum. We spent first hour to go through the Exhibits on the 2nd flood before joining the museum. Love the tour guide (volunteer) who told us so much about Singapore history. The tour was supposed to last for an hour but she was 20 mins over. Very interesting and informative tour. We are glad we waited an hour to do our own walking before joining
,,Great history museum in Singapore,5.0,,I always enjoy visiting the National Museum in Singapore. There is usually an interesting special exhibit going on as well as the excellent permanent galleries. An especially interesting gallery is the one that tells the story of the Japanese occupation during World War II. There are other interesting looks at popular culture and social life during both the colonial era and the evolution of Singapore since independence. This museum is definitely worth spending several hours of your day.
,,Well presented but not much content,3.0,,"The museum is in a spectacular building and the displays are well layed out and well explained as you'd exoect from a modern museum. But for $15 I expected there to be more...could easily be done in an hour.

Small expensive coffee shop, hardly any gift shop."
,,A history of Singapore from past to present,5.0,,"Interesting displays and dioramas of the history of Singapore, from its foundation as a city to its trading history and today."
,,"Stunning, Informative & Captivating",5.0,,"My wife and I spent a wet and thundery Thursday at the National Museum and were astounded at just how wonderful it was.
This was our 3rd trip to Singapore, yet our first visit to the Museum.
The displays are first class, detailing the history of Singapore dating back centuries through to it's independence and it becoming the modern, thriving city state that it is today.
Beautiful, thought provoking and informative, it's a must see when in Singapore."
,,Historical,4.0,,Spent 2 to 3 hours and loving the ambient and architecture of the museum. Enjoying the flora exhibition.
,,Interesting,4.0,,"A very interesting museum which comprehensively covers the history of Singapore, from it's time as a trading post to the present day. Some of the exhibits were extremely educational, especially the ones about the Japanese invasion and the split from Malaysia"
,,A good history lesson but not many interesting artifacts,3.0,,Spent a couple hours at the museum. As for most of the city it is clean and nicely presented. You will learn about the history of Singapore but don't expect any fascinating artefacts or exhibits.
,,Museum tour,5.0,,My friend and I joined a free one hour tour of the National Museum. This was very interesting and gave us a good idea of the layout and contents of the museum
,,Excellent Museum,5.0,,Excellent museum to spend the day and to understand the history of Singapore. Well done pieces on different era's of Singapore's history that will pull you in and educate as well as thrill.
,,A must see for anyone interested in Singapore history.,4.0,,There is a very good gallery with interesting displays covering the early days of the island through to the Japanese invasion and the post war creation of Singapore.
,,History at it's Best !,4.0,,"To learn more about the colorful history of Singapore you have to visit this National Museum Singapore.
What a great old building, combined with modern design.
The restaurant is fine and friendly personal. The shop is poor.
For children is this a good place to learn more about the past."
,,Singapore through its history,5.0,,There is so much more to Singapore then meets the eye. This museum takes you on a journey of the evolution and growth of a country that was once a trading village and then it slowly evolved and grew.It documents its struggle for independence to its current developed state. If you want to know it all then visit this place.
,,Fantastic Intro to Singapore,5.0,,"We went on the free guided tour, which was given by a French lady. She clearly had a practiced routine, but was also able to answer questions off the cuff, so that was great. The museum exhibits though are also fine to explore at your own pace without a guide, as the signage is pretty extensive and informative.

Point of information- if you're going straight from Battlebox to here, you can enter the museum by the back entrance as you come down the hill from Battlebox. Just remember to go to the front to purchase a ticket."
,,Learning about Singapore,4.0,,"If ever you want to learn about the Historical path and the civilisation of Singapore, this is the museum you have to visit. Buildings are well renovated and you can enjoy extra expositions. So not hesitate, you will learn something."
,,Learn about Singapore,4.0,,"Big modern and interesting museum that cover the relatively short history of the country from the age of trading villages, to the Portuguese and Dutch merchants, to the British Empire, to the struggle for independence until the present day.
Great displays of everyday items, photos, maps, paintings with a strong emphasis on the contribution that the three main ethnic groups have made to Singapore.
The galleries displaying the more recent history are particularly interesting as they show all the effort and struggle that went into creating contemporary Singapore (and also the effort in projecting a totally positive image of a country with no problems at all....)."
,,Excellent Museum highlighting Singapore's history,5.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore provides an in-depth look at Singapore's history, starting with its fishing village origins, to the modern, wealthy state it is today.

The 1st floor houses the ""Singapore History Gallery"" and the 2nd floor has smaller galleries based around ""Life in Singapore""."
,,Interesting museum,4.0,,We visited the National Museum recently during our time in Singapore and were lucky to attend on a day when the additional exhibits on display were nearing the end of their display period so our viewing was free. The museum itself has a wide range of art history and some lovely displays that delve into Singapore's past.
,,"Affordable, Informative, Fun!",4.0,,"The museum is inexpensive and incredibly extensive. Students (even foreign students) can receive a discount by showing student ID cards. This attraction is very affordable.

Besides the affordability, it is beyond worth the money. I learned an incredible amount about Singapore's history and easily spent 3 hours there and didn't see nearly everything. Some exhibits are interactive making this an option for those travelling with children too. Anyone who enjoys history will love this attraction as it portrays the history of Singapore through written information plaques, tangible objects, photographs, and engaging exhibits!"
,,A great place to vsiit,5.0,,A wonderful experience with some really interesting exhibits. The building in itself is really lovely.
,,Not only for history buffs,4.0,,"The building itself is a landmark: the first purpose-built museum in Queen Victoria's times. Free guided tours (1 hr, very informative and entertaining) are available at 11 am and 2 pm, and 20% discount applies if you show your Singapore Airlines boarding pass. A great place to learn about the fascinating history of Singapore.
Upstairs, I also saw something completely different - and kids would love it: a high-tech, animated interactive display called 'Birth of the Forest"" - best enjoyed lying on the comfortable bean bags provided and watching the show on the ceiling."
,,Good as an introduction,3.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore offers a comprehensive overview of Singapore's history from the establishment of the very first fishing village by a passing King to the post-independence development and industrialization. However, unless you visit this as soon as possible during your Singapore holiday, you will find it a tad boring. I didn't get here till me last day and having already been to the Former Ford Factory, Battle Box, Changi Museum, Singapore City Gallery, Arts House at Old Parliament, Chinatown Heritage Centre, Peranakan Museum and many others, I found that the National Museum was repeating what I had already seen. The smaller Life in Singapore Galleries on the 2nd floor did not add much to the main (and extremely well-presented) Singapore History Gallery on the ground floor. The Glass Rotunda displays a Disney-style little kids magic forest with zero connection to Singapore. The National Museum is undoubtedly a good museum, but I found visiting individual attractions made for a more enjoyable experience."
,,Really enjoyable experience worth a visit,4.0,,"Just the architect and seeing this building is great , but enjoying the paintings and exhibitions was wonderful , modern air conditioned , large well versed staff everywhere to assist you"
,,Only place that showcases the history of Singapore,4.0,,"I was very interested in how Singapore became the global city that it is today, given that around 50 years ago it was a third-world country. I found the displays informative, and they also include some audio recordings of actual people who were the first few residents of HDBs (very interesting!). However, I found the first few parts of the exhibit confusing--I knew nothing about Singapore/Malaysia geography and so found the displays hard to follow.

Overall though, I recommend it. I just wish they had a better layout, and more information about life from 1965-present."
,,Well done museum,5.0,,"The museum does a good job with the cultural history of Singapore. Don't expect much on natural history. Could be better on the pre-British eras, but definitely worth the time."
,,"Past, Present, and the Future of Singapore",5.0,,I spent like 4 hours in here because the museum has installed a detailed exhibition of its rich history as a young island city-state-- from its humble beginnings up to the challenges of the present and future plans. You will appreciate every effort made in each gallery to showcase to the world what Singapore has achieved.
,,Like so much of Singapore carried out to a very high standard,5.0,,This is yet another place in Singapore that is well worth a visit - took us 3.5 hours as there was so much to take in. Very good value for money and something for all ages
,,Educational,5.0,,The building is beautiful and has been renovated. The Singapore History Gallery is well presented and educational. Well worth the visit. Other exhibits were okay.
,,Very cool - worth doing,4.0,,"Great history and interesting exhibits. The building itself is quite lovely, and they have several options for dining. The day we were there they also had a free concert of a string quartet in the lobby which was lovely. Nice place to visit in Singapore"
,,Visit to get historical background,4.0,,"Very large and only managed to visit one floor which took 3 hours to cover. Many interesting exhibits but few places to sit and rest so probably not for those who have difficulty in walking.
Ecellent cafe which is inexpensive by local standards. A short walk from the MTR station"
,,Singapore's rich history,5.0,,"I came to the museum on a Friday morning in March and it wasn't too crowded, so it was easy to see and read about everything. If you are a Singaporean resident, admission is free, which is awesome. My admission price was S$15. The Singapore History Gallery is a thoughtful, well described and curated walk through the history of the country from Singapura all the way to Singapore as it is now. It was incredibly educational and fascinating. From rickshaw coolies, to secret societies, through the British Crown Colony, Japanese invasion, up to economic prosperity, there is so much to learn about this small but diverse nation.

In the glass rotunda I explored the installation ""Story of the Forest"" which was an immersive, colorful view of life in a forest including a dark room where you can lay on the floor and watch flowers open and fall down along with shooting stars and a neon forest with pink deer. It was oddly relaxing. Afterwards there was Singapore, Very Old Tree, which is an installation of photos in light boxes of people with their favorite trees, inspired by an old post card that simply read ""Singapore, Very Old Tree."" It was really nice and the trees were incredible, along with the stories behind them.

I highly recommend a stop here for at least an hour just to get a better feel for how Singapore got to this place now and more insight into how they became such a diverse country."
,,Nice little walk through of Singapore history,4.0,,Nicely divided up in timeline segments. Holding several interesting stores form each period. The olde building have just been renovated to perfection. Beautiful and educating.
,,An afternoon at the Museum,4.0,,"The National Museum could use some face lifting in terms of its exhibits, since it focused more on the events around World War 2 and thereafter. Present day Singapore should be given ample exhibit space. I love their Sight and Sound parts."
,,Nice way to learn about Singapore,4.0,,Easy to get through in a couple of hours and get a nice overview of the history of Singapore. The information was well presented. Was looking for something to do while staying over a weekend on business and this hit the mark.
,,A well-presented museum of social and artistic history,5.0,,"This is an accessible and attractive museum, tracing the history of the area and the nation. Free guided tours are a very helpful and well articulated interpretation of what you see there."
,,Wonderful Display of Singaporean History,5.0,,"When I visit Singapore, I try to also visit this Museum. The history of Singapore is very interesting and this museum does an excellent job of telling the story."
,,A lot to see,5.0,,"This museum is towards the back of SMU and is in a pristine environment, they combine a wonderful and comprehensive history of Singapore, and in the back, new addition, they host visiting exhibitions. I really had a great afternoon there-wonderful"
,,Well worth a visit if you have some extra time in Singapore,4.0,,We were on a back to back cruise in Singapore and had a few hours until we had to get back to the ship. We went the museum because of all the good reviews. It was very expensive and decided to go anyway. We had a one hour tour with an English speaking guide who was very good even though English was her second language. There was a very large group of children visiting the museum which made hearing the guide very difficult but she did try her best. If you have a few hours and want to get out of the heat this is a good place to visit.
,,Beautifully Renovated,4.0,,Great place to wander through- plenty of free areas to learn about the heritage of the building. Smoke and Mirrors on the rooftop has a phenomenal view of Singapore
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Very good museum, there are tour guides on the hour that last an hour. Our guide was excellent taking us through the history of Singapore from its beginnings until present day. Fascinating and very informative especially the Second World War period with the Japanese invasion and the struggle for independence. Well worth a vusit"
,,A museum of national importance,5.0,,"I first came to the Museum back in 1972! However it has undergone major renovations back in 2006 and fortunately is within walking distance of Raffles Hotel, so on a rainy day the Museum is definately well worth a visit as it focuses on the history of Singapore and is also a National Monument of Singapore. Absolutely fascinating and allow a few hours here"
,,Most. Interesting visit,5.0,,"We had an afternoon free of our children and grandchildren and the personnel at the St Regis suggested we visit the museum
We were fortunate to join a museum tour and spent a most interesting afternoon learning about the history of Singapore - a bit of culture during a great time with our children in sungapore"
,,An excellent place to visit on a wet day!,5.0,,A well presented and very interesting museum with a variety of methods of display to keep the attention of the visitor. The historical details of the Japanese invasion were particularly interesting for Europeans who had little understanding of this period.
,,Japanese Forest Animation,4.0,,Came here with the kids today to see the Forest Animation exhibition. Some quite impressive graphics on display and well thought out. The permanent exhibits don't seem to have changed much since our last visit. Free entrance for Singaporeans and PRs so no complaints.
,,Very Interesting,4.0,,Well worth a visit as it takes you on a journey through the history of Singapore in a very unique and interesting way.
,,"A nice museu, overpriced",4.0,,"I liked my visit here but think the ticket is a bit expensive for this museum. Unlike other fellows wrote, the normal ticket is 15 Singapore Dollars, not 10, and that's a significant difference. That's about 10 Eur and a bit pricey for the size and quality of the exhibit.

Otherwise, it's a fine museum, with nice displays, approaching the history of Singapore, although if one looks closely, it becomes obvious that the collection available to the public is quite limited. Not much juice, most of the experience comes from the decoration and the care in the organization of the rooms."
,,Excellent history tour of Singapore,5.0,,"Evidently reopened last autumn after extensive renovation, this is an excellent facility which leads you through an easy to follow journey of Singapore's history. Very imaginatively laid out.
The success of this tiny country since independence from Britain and subsequent separation from Malaysia is well illustrated. It has been really remarkable, and sometimes by the skin of its teeth!
A guided tour night well be worthwhile though we chose to go alone.
A must visit."
,,National Museum of Singapore,5.0,,"The museum located in Stamford Road, around SMU. And the entrance fee is S$15 for non citizen. But if you have citizen card or PR Card, you can visit free.

When I go, there is an exhibition themed Nature and Singapore's history. In Nature section, there is one room that full of led that show us the motion video of forest and the animal. And in History section, it show us the begining of Singapore nation and all the cultural development until now.

We spent almost 2,5 hours there. We really enjoy the time..."
,,Excellent Experience,5.0,,"We had an excellent English language tour of the Singapore history section of the museum. Volunteer guide was knowledgeable and humorous. Gave us an excellent understanding of Singapore. While we thought the museum was free, there was a fee to enter. However, it was well worth the cost. We didn't have time to see everything and would certainly go back on a future visit."
,,Good for Singapore,4.0,,"Living in London can sometimes mean that other national museums don't measure up! This is a good one though because it is compact and has interesting exhibits. The $S15 (¬£7.50/$US10/¬•1,200) entry is also reasonable in my view.

My favourite aspect about this one is that one exhibit gives you a very good and succinct history of Singapore. Very well displayed with the right amount of artefacts, videos, etc to make the right impact.

There is a nice restaurant and bar as well as a cafe to have a break in as well.

Being close to everything, it's a good place to visit whilst in Singapore."
,,Enjoyable couple of hours,5.0,,Really enjoyed learning a bit more about the Singapore history and loved the exhibitions we saw during our visit. The food was very good at the cafe too. Well worth a visit!
,,Take a guided tour,5.0,,Fascinating history and well set out. Good for children and families. Some very sad stories but worth hearing them.
,,Interesting and easy going,4.0,,very good to have a stroll during Sunday or Saturday if you have just arrived from long trip. Or if you are on holiday of course...
,,Expansive,5.0,,We were worn out but the end of this extensive museum. The exhibits are well thought out and labeled and covers the full extent of SIngapore's history. They had a couple of special exhibits while we were there and it seems they put a lot of effort into it.
,,Lovely Peaceful place,5.0,,"Great place to learn the history of Singapore and how Europeans helped and hindered the Singapore people and culture. Cannot remember the costs of Entry but I think it was less than 10SPD per person.

Highly recommended and I think we spent about 4 or 5 hours there, but that included a spot of lunch as well."
,,A wet day find!!!,5.0,,"We are NOT museum people but this place is something else. Heavy rain so went there. 10 Singapore Dollars and spent 4 hours!!! 2nd floor Rotunda is one long, spiralling DVD screen showing plants and animals of the area. A sort of planetarium where you lie on bean bags and look up at projections on ceiling of flower petals falling down. Magical. Rooms showing stages of Singapore life with interactive displays - even a drive in cinema!!!!! Do go.,"
,,Very good museum,4.0,,Gives you a good picture of the old times and fast forward later phases. Can be experienced in 2 hours
,,Worth a Look,3.0,,Nice place to have a stroll through on a hot day and take in the exhibits and history of Singapore. Worth a visit if you have some free time.
,,excellent,5.0,,Visited the museum with may grandson (1 year old) and enjoyed an excellent lunch before wandering round the museum . Lots to see and especially interesting for the very young especially
,,One of the best museums ever,5.0,,"This is a must see museum. Singapore's history is relatively new, but it has packed much into its time. There is so much to learn about Singapore, especially from WWII onward. The exhibits are excellent as are the narrations. We managed to spend 5 1/2 hours there before we realized what the time was."
,,Wonderful a must!,5.0,,Great museum can be easily visited in 90 minutes. They offer free tours which I really recommend. A great introduction to the amazing history of this nation.
,,One of the best Museums in Singapore,5.0,,"Great museum, one of my favourite in Singapure. entrance $10. m check the website for free guided tours - offered daily. great place to learn more about Singapore. One of the 'must' places to visit"
,,High standard,5.0,,"Typically classy, creative and organised. Singaporean museums are generally impressive but this was my favourite. We spent almost five hours here! The historic time line was my favourite part because the city has had such a rich and interesting history. Being English it is always especially interesting to me when my own countries history is woven into the history of others and for once not in an entirely negative way!"
,,One of my favourite National Museums,5.0,,"I spent two hours learning the roots of Singapore, how did they create the country. I love this place a lot. I learnt loads of things about Singapore and Singaporeans. It's one of the 'must' places to visit when you go to this country!"
,,An excellent Museum,5.0,,"This is one of the best Museums we have visited, very well laid out with maximum explanations. Most of the exhibits are on the ground floor which makes it very easy to visit. An excellent Cafe, the coffee is delicious!"
,,Great introduction to the history of Singapore,5.0,,"The museum layout felt a little disjointed at times, but there was still plenty here to see and learn.
I especially liked the exhibits on the early days of colonial Singapore and the descriptions of Raffles and his exploits to thwart the Dutch in the area."
,,Lovely museum,5.0,,"Exhibits are really well presented, and excellent chance to learn more about Singapore, its people, and history."
,,Beautifully restored building,5.0,,For anyone wishing to delve into the history of Singapore a visit to this museum with its' many exhibits is an absolute must!
,,Amazing collection and well presented,5.0,,I was able to take advantage of free guided tour in English by a very knowledgeable and informative guide. Interesting cross section of exhibits across time and topic from art to culture to religion. Easy to navigate and spend as much or as little time as suites you.
,,Just Amazing,5.0,,"Stuck in Singapore over 3 day weekend public holiday. Other booked tours cancelled last minute by companies. So set out on my own walking adventure and found a beautifully architectured building housing the National Museum of Singapore, free entry. Most enjoyable was the chronological history of Singapore including the invasion, recovery and earlier philanthropist and pioneers of development and Singapore society."
,,Must see when in Singapore,5.0,,"It is not just the art exhibited which is worth seeing. Equally worthwhile and interesting is to see the architecture of the old Supreme Court and Government building. To see all - plan at least 2-3 hours. There are some excellent restaurants on this site, although most are only open for dinner."
,,"Great collection, perfect at the hot part of the day",5.0,,"The museum is exceptionally well done. You need a fair amount of time to really take it in. Better if you don't consider it a ""walking trail"" and spend the time to read the interpretive panels. Plan for a few hours at least. Not a stop, but a destination."
,,A good Cultural Experience,4.0,,Spectacular building. Well laid out exhibitions but do need to give yourself time. Well air conditioned. There is a cafe to take a rest.
,,Waited 16 Years To Visit This Place,4.0,,"I have lived in Singapore for 10 years and was away for 6, but this was my very first visit to this Museum. Being a Permanent Resident, my entrance to both the Permanent Galleries and Special Exhibitions was free. I joined the hour long guided tour and altho I pretty much know a bit about Singapores history it gave me further insight into some unknown past of Singapore. It was a very informative one hour tour on Singapores history. After my guided tour, I went to the SPecial Exhibition from a French Regional Collections and the exhibits were very interesting. I also went up to the second floor to see a very colourful and innovative approach to art...the Glass Rotunda: Story of a Forest which was a light and sound art exhibit. I would highly recommend a visit to this museum."
,,Begin here if you've never been to Singapore,5.0,,"This is the place to start if you want to know anything about the history of Singapore. It's a beautiful museum with a great variety of smaller exhibits dealing with history, the arts, and so on. I really enjoyed it as a way to get started understanding Singapore. Afterwards, go out the back and have a walk through the beautiful Fort Canning Park."
,,Top place,5.0,,This was a great museum with lots of interesting features. It gave us a real insight into the history and culture of Singapore. It is definitely worth a visit.
,,Singapore history well presented,4.0,,"Very interesting history, learnt a lot and presented in many different ways. Also went to the additional exhibition, which wasn't even worth the extra 3 sgd."
,,Very worthwhile visit,4.0,,The history of Singapore exhibit is very interesting and well done and never pious. The current digital representation of the living forest is commendable and worth the detour
,,Lovely Mix of Colonial and Modern,5.0,,The architecture and exhibits captures the history of Singapore. Well worth the visit. The exhibits engage visitors without overwhelming. Well curated.
,,A great place to understand how Singapore came to be,5.0,,Took advantage of the free guided tour from a volunteer guide who was both entertaining and informative. Well designed exhibits covering 700 years+ of history. some good temporary exhibits and some amazing art works with a biennial exhibition. Look forward to visit it again.
,,The Rotunda is worth a visit in itself,4.0,,I enjoyed the Museum. The cafe also provides excellent lunches and the whole experience is of a modern Museum explaining Singapore and its history. I took the tour guide (free) which I would recommend. The Rotunda experience with the digital moving mosaic/tapestry and flowers falling from the sky is hard to describe but amazing!
,,More impressive as you go deeper inside.,5.0,,"When I first went inside, I didn't think this place was going to be all that special. Past the front entrance there was a giant, 10 or 15 feet sphere of thousands of pots and pans suspended on individual strings from the ceiling.
But once I was deeper inside, I found some very thoughtful presentations on the history of Singapore from its early days as a colony to the WWII occupation and up to the present. There is a major exhibition of the founder of Singapore, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, showing his personal effects and telling the history of post war independence and nation building. The front part of the museum is what used to be the national library built probably in the Victorian era and the back half is an entirely modern glass and steel structure. It integrates well with the older front half and is awesome visually. Inside the new part of the museum is something that resembles a planetarium, but in this case is a forest. There are dozens of projectors that makes you feel you are inside this imaginary forest at night as you descend a spiral ramp. It is very well done and a great place to take children to.
Of course, the message is ""be kind to the environment."" In the historical exhibitions, there are artifacts of early colony life, a replica of a old wooden trading ship. There are diaries, ration documents and enacted testimonies from citizens who suffered through the WWII Japanese occupation . There is one exhibition on postwar Singapore, showing the consumer goods such as TVs, radios, toys that fill the homes of a society that gradually because more prosperous. There is also a caf√© and restaurant inside the museum to rest your weary feet."
,,Creative exhibitions,4.0,,"A lovely museum in a beautiful building, lots of space and light. I only got to see two exhibitions but they were both so good the time just ran away and before we knew it four hours had gone! The history of Singapore exhibition was very interesting and well thought out and the forest exhibition in the glass rotunda was stunning. What I saw in this museum was not the conventional layout and thought process of a lot of museums. Here they take you on a journey of discovery. I will definitely return here to see more. Oh there is an entry cost but as I went just after Chinese New Year it was free entry so I cannot say how much this is. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was just because I didn't spot a good shop where I would have loved to have bought souvenirs of the exhibitions I did see. They may well have one but if so I missed it. If they don't it's an opportunity missed!"
,,Wonderful museum,5.0,,"I hadn't been to this museum since it was renovated several years ago. It has always been, architecturally, a beautiful museum. But now, the exhibits match the grandeur and history.
The exhibits cover Singapore's colorful and fascinating history, both visually and auditory. I can't recommend it enough for a first time visitor or the frequent visitor unfamiliar with the background of this beautiful country"
,,Extensively refurbished and oldest museum in singapore,4.0,,"Our visit took at least two hours to view the Singapore history section on the ground floor plus the life in Singapore exhibition on the first floor. The older buildings have been linked beautifully with a light airy atrium, including escalators, excellent toilet facilities, a cafe and a restaurant. Both eating places were quite up market and expensive. Interesting exhibition of the living forest in the glass rotunda with lots of digital displays and an amazing projection which was quite disorientating. Entrance was discounted for being over 60, so $11 instead of the $20 plus, some benefits of seniority even here!"
,,"Precious collection, Must Visit",5.0,,"The Amazing arts from all around the world in modern department of the Museum Updates every year. It is admirable of enthusiastic and hardworking of people of Singapore. Every single items of art has something for real meaning of life, Taking care of the Earth, Happiness and thankfulness. This Museum is a good taste of life, A real one."
,,A very enjoyable museum,5.0,,"Never was there a dull moment, with exhibitions for everybody. The main exhibition shows Singapore's short but rich history, with other temporary art displays which were interactive and beautiful. Good value for half a day's visit."
,,"Programmatic, modern museum",4.0,,"that presents the quasi-official narrative of Singapore just how this is done in state-of-the-art museums today. Typical Singaporean post-post-modern refurbishment of a classic-colonial building. Two overhyped restaurants where you need reservations even for lunch - i.e. places that should *not* be in a museum, where the idea is that you can have a nice lunch break during your visit. Spontaneously. (Ok, Singaporeans love to queue and to reserve, but this is really ridiculous.) The highlight for me clearly was the forest story installation; this is magical, well-done, and also great for kids of all ages."
,,Great Collection,5.0,,This museum tells the story of Singapore. The collection is worth your time. Don't miss this cultural place.
,,Fascinating Museum!,5.0,,"You have to put this place into your list, especially when you walk around Orchard Road. You will reach this museum by MRT, either from Dhoby Gaut (Plaza Singapura) or Bras Basah.

This museum covers the Singapore's chronicles from pre-historic, colonial development, and modern Singapore as multicultural nation and society. Instead its main story of colonial period and modern Singapore, this museum also includes a number of contemporary multimedia exhibitions from world's artists. Museum's staff are so friendly and helpful. Small area in this museum also offers foods and beverages with reasonable price."
,,Brighten up a rainy day. Interesting history of Singapore,5.0,,"Good museum. Well worth three hours or so. Lots of different media: videos, audio recordings, exhibition style as well as the usual exhibits. Everything from the early colonial days, to the birth of the nation and the growth to the power house of today. Plus changing exhibitions."
,,Do This Museum First!,5.0,,"This was the first attraction that we went to in Singapore. It is a good place to start as it covers the history of Singapore from about 6000 years ago to current day. Singapore is an amazing place where several races live in Harmony. This museum covers the journey to get there.

It took us about 4 hours to go through the museum and we ate lunch there. This is a good quality museum and I recommend going to see it.

To get there I would recommend using the Bras Basah metro instead of the City Hall metro as this is a long walk especially when the temperature is high and it is humid."
,,Colonial Past,4.0,,"The main exhibits give the fascinating story of the development of Singapore from early times but the main story was of its Colonial development. Singapore today owes a lot to the foresight of those early entrepreneurs. People of all nationalities who flocked to Singapore to work are represented as well as the higher echelons. How they lived before, during and after WW2, how they dressed, entertained themselves and coped with hardships was well portrayed. We spent 4 hours absorbing it all and could have spent longer.

The caf√© provided a good selection of food and drinks and the waiting staff were very friendly and helpful."
,,Good way to know the history of Singapore,4.0,,"Quite detailed in accounting the history of Singapore and its development till date. Disappointed with ""What is not visible is not invisible"". Expected more from it, but it turned out to be a no. of videos, some extending upto 30 minutes or more and quite often slow."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"I would recommend to take the guided tour for an hour, it is included in the price. Easy museum to get through."
,,Great museum and informative disaplays,5.0,,"Worth the visit if you want to learn of Singapore history and culture. Neat light display and clean. Be prepared to walk a lot, its a big place"
,,Just right,5.0,,"This is a well put together, informative and very representative of Singapore as a nation. You would expect that, from a country renowned for efficiency. While small, the museum provides relevant information in the history of the country , without trying to go too too far in the past. It can be argued that Singapore is a new country and therefore there is not much history , Well, visit the museum and you will see that it's not quite like that. The museum is in close proximity to two MRT stations; Dhoby Ghauht and Bras Basah and several bus stations While most people don't associate Singapore with museum visits , I would strongly suggest a visit ; good break from shopping !"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Not only does this museum have an excellent display of art work but the restaurants are worth a visit on their own.
,,another great musuem,5.0,,Singapore does a lot of things well. museums being one of those things. great way too escape the humidity is too visit these informative and interesting museum. even if you don't visit inside the exterior is very photogenic
,,"History, Art, Culture, Society.",5.0,,It has it all and it's done beautifully. I saw a French curated contemporary art exhibition as well as the permanent excellent History of Singapore. There were also galleries of information around Singapore society etc. It's a must visit place!
,,Super Interesting,5.0,,"Access to this museum is via taxi so while leaving request security to call a taxi for you; they are super helpful. This museum is great filled with interesting crystal chandeliers,galleries including Stamford Gallery,Life in Singapore, Voices of Singapore, Modern Colony, Surviving Syonan. It houses very interesting a modern projection wall on the flora and fauna in Singapore through all the various seasons,Singapore through the ages, abstract art, modern art, spaces left to imagination with lights and projection mapping.Gallery 10 is very interesting. It is a quirky mix of new and old. At the centre there is Cooking the World sculpture of aluminium vessels and the interpretation of the artist is very interesting. Definitely a great trip and a must see in Singapore."
,,Great for Singapore's history,4.0,,It's one of the nicest museum in Singapore - it closes early so best to be there in the morning (escape the afternoon crowd) & take a walk to nearby Dhoby Ghaut afterwards for lunch. They have new exhibition every year so check out their website as well!
,,Expensive,3.0,,We stopped for a snack during our visit to this excellent museum. The food and drinks were average but very expensive.
,,Explore the Singaporean life,3.0,,"Started in 1887, it offers an insight the life of Singaporeans. There is a seamless blend of neo modern architecture with the old. Do not forget to check out the Singapore History and Living galleries."
,,Fills in important info about Singapore's history,4.0,,My daughter and I spent about 2 hours going through this museum. The sections devoted to distinct periods in the history of Singapore were well-done and really helped provide important information about the development of this unique place. I definitely recommend this!
,,Great way to learn about Singapore,5.0,,"I was in Singapore for business and having virtually no knowledge of the area or its history i decided to go visit the museum. Not only was it very enlightening, it was entertaining to see the various stages of Singapore's development. If you haven't been, you will definitely learn a thing or two!"
,,best way to beat the heat,4.0,,"Learn a thing or two, or more, about Singapore's not too long history. At the same time, for a small price to pay, you get to enjoy airconditioning and a bit of respite from the tropical afternoon sun... and perhaps some shelter from the tropical rain and thunderstorm. (note that weather is unpredictable in Sg and you should always check the weather forecast... and trust it some of the time).
The museum is a great place to see and learn about this small, great island.
The gift shop also stocks some interesting and unique knick-knacks that can be obtained for a small price to pay.

Visit the musuems. today"
,,Essential for understanding Singapore,5.0,,"This is not an encyclopedic museum, but it gives an excellent overview of matters Singaporean. Be sure to visit all the exhibits."
,,History of Singapor explained,5.0,,This is a nice museum if you would like to know more about the history of Singapor and the region. We stayed longer then I expected. With is a good sign ;-)
,,Always something interesting to see.,5.0,,"This is a well run , well staffed experience in Singapore.

A beautiful building , recently refurbished in great style..

New exhibitions regularly,always top notch.
We recently saw an exhibition on Empire and Art and it was a perfect example of fine art but also detailing the history behind the work. pieces from all over the world.
brilliant."
,,"Tasteful Renovation, lots to see and do!",4.0,,"The National Museum is a wonderful building that has something to see for everyone. The blend of old and new, colonial and modern is so refreshing, and should be a benchmark for restorations in the future. Tour guides very nice, and staff were accommodating to our large group!"
,,I learned a lot from my visit to this museum! Must come back soon!,5.0,,"I did not realise that behind the facade of this historical there are so much to see so much to do! By the way, the building itself is amazing!

I didn't know where to begin which one I should start exploring. But my first impression on entering the entrance, it was like 'wow', I was faced with an installation of a ball of 'pots and pans' handed under the rotunda. Then as I explored, there was one after another piece of art or object, or even the interior of the building that attracted my attention.

They had a number of temporary exhibitions - which I enjoyed thoroughly, it was about 'Forest' - how the exhibition ensured that visitors get the chance to interact with what was exhibited. The exhibition made me got so interested and immersed in what they want us to know.

It was like in every part of the museum, they make sure that we stay attracted, and stimulated our way of thinking, making sure we think beyond our normal day-to-day thinking, deeper in thoughts.

I will definitely be back whenever I get the chance."
,,Explores the History of Singapore,3.0,,"As it turned out this museum wasn't a museum of natural history (which is what I was expecting when I walked in through the door) but rather a museum of the history of the city of Singapore. It was actually quite interesting, and told me a lot more about the background of the city that the exhibition I visited the last time I was here (which was basically the story of Singapore told through the newspaper). It is interesting, but probably not a go to place if there are other things you wish to do."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"We visited the museum after our drink at Raffles. It's only 5 /10 minute walk down Stamford Road. The main exhibit - the history of Singapore took us about 2 hours to walk round and took us from the 14th Century up to date. Good visual and audio exhibits including films,original letters portraits and and original documents all of which painted a comprehensive picture of Singapore history. The exhibit documenting everyday day life from the beginning of the 20th century, the fall of the island to the Japanese during the Second World War through to independence, was particularly interesting and added another dimension to our visit to Changi prison the previous day. There are a couple of smaller exhibits covering trees and couple of sensory rooms on the first floor. Not really our thingThe cafe and souvenir shop are reasonably priced. the entrance fee was bout 11 Singapore dollars"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"We really enjoyed looking around the national museum and would definitely say it's worth a visit. The exhibitions are interesting and the glass rotunda in particular is quite something, lying down looking up at the falling flowers in the dome was mesmerising"
,,Great museum with good free tour guides,5.0,,This is a good place to visit if you are looking to learn more about the history of Singapore. I would highly recommend walking through the museum with one of the free tours provided by the museum.
,,Not Free and not much to see,2.0,,"The museum building itself is beautiful and clean. Location is easy to access.
They do bring some FREE events however they keep charging a little things if they can.

Foreigner residents are kept charged while all Singaporean can be free which is not a nice concepts. They keep forgetting many foreigners are supporting this country and should be treated fairly.

Children's weeks events used to be more attractions and fun but it is deteriorating and not fun anymore. I do not know why authorities would not put more effort for such events to motivate children's artistic senses and curiosities.

I wish more improvements and efforts."
,,One for the history buffs!,5.0,,"Entered through the Rotunda down Story of the Forest to History of Singapore. Fascinating exhibitions, could have spent all day there. Also had tasty light lunch in the cafeteria. Will go back to see more."
,,Fantastic overview of the city and more...,5.0,,"A great overview of history, both ancient & contemporary. Amazing interactive displays and modern art exhibitions in additional sections too. Well worth a visit, especially on a rainy day!"
,,Great collection hard to navigate,3.0,,"This place is huge. The art is terrific but most confusing. The museum shop is fun, the building is incredible and the roof garden wonderful."
,,The Place to discover Singapore's History,4.0,,"A series of smaller galleries are offshoots to a main gallery that tells visitors the history of Singapore -- via artefacts, music, historical recordings, videos, and excellent local docents (worth waiting to catch a free 60-minute tour) bring together this city better than any guidebook could. Two hours spent here is one of the best investments visitors can make. Put it top of your list and the rest of Singapore (Little India, Chinatown, Raffles Statue, boat quay) all fall into place afterwards. Small coffeeshop for snacks and light meals and a fine dining restaurant (that is obviously used by the local business crowd at lunch and couples dining out in the evenings) had a very tempting menu. Don't miss the outdoor sculpture and if you're in luck, there might even be a special visiting exhibition while you're there as well (they've had mummies from the British Museum, a Pompeii exhibit, etc. in the past)."
,,A museum of wonders,5.0,,"It's sad that museums are sometimes stereotyped to be boring, because the National Museum of Singapore is truly a wonder.

The exhibits are all presented ever so creatively, with props and visual aids that really bring out the atmosphere and allow you to immerse yourself into the past. Of course, for many of us, the different exhibits also present opportunities for us to take our photos and OOTDs.

There are many different exhibits in the museum, spread across different floors. The permanent ones include exhibits like Singapore History Gallery, Growing Up (where you get to see the kampung life of the 1950s and 60s), Surviving Syonan (where you can listen to stories of those who have been through the Japanese Occupation in Singapore during World War II).

My favourite from the permanent exhibits would be the Glass Rotunda, which has been furnished and reopened recently, this time with an installation known as the Story of the Forest. It was really amazing, as you could almost immerse yourself entirely into this fantasy world with lights and images of the forest and the magical creatures.

Right now, there is also a temporary exhibit called What is Not Visible is not Invisible, which is pretty interesting with its many installations. And yes, these are the exhibits that make good photo opportunities for your Instagram or Facebook feed.

It's free for Singapore citizens and PRs, and even for tourists, the admission fee is worth paying for, because the museum is really a masterpiece.

To get there, take the train to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, and take any exit from the North-South Line (red line). Then, walk towards Rendezvous Hotel and Singapore Management University (SMU). Behind SMU, you would see a building with the words ""YMCA"" on it. The National Museum of Singapore is just next to it."
,,Always worth a visit to the local museum,4.0,,We always try and visit the local museums in our travels and suggest that the Singapore National Museum is worth a few hours of your time. I was not taken my the art exhibitions on the lower levels but enjoyed the rest of the exhibitions and history on display. It is also a lovely building.
,,Excellent Museum,3.0,,A fun and interesting museum of artifacts and paintings. Excellent way to keep cool for a couple hours. More for adults and teens. Quiet area.
,,Worthwhile to visit,4.0,,"It was a rainy day and therefore the best choice for a museum. The building is beautiful and even though is not that big is interesting and you can spend one hour learning about tSingapores past
There are different expositions that will illustrate the diversity of the different races. A melting pot where you will feel at home"
,,Wonderful experience,4.0,,Good place to visit for both young and adults. Will take about 2-3 hours to see the complete museum.
,,To all history lovers,5.0,,Singapore had an interesting past which worth to look at. The reasons of economic success lie behind the historic decisions and people. This museum gives fulfilling summary of the past.
,,An outstanding timeline of the history of Singapore,5.0,,"Some museums just do it and some don't. This is one that does - and then some. In an old colonial building, the space is used well without being overdone. Wen tin for a hour and stayed nearly three.
I've been in and out of Singapore for the past 3 decades and learnt more about the country in this visit to the National Museum."
,,Best way to learn the history of Singapore,5.0,,"We spent about 2 hours at the museum. Very well organized from the earliest days, Colonial times, World War II, and recent history. The museum is very well organized. The exhibits are well done. I recommend this to any first time visitors to this beautiful city."
,,Nice Afternoon trip,4.0,,"The national museum is located in the vicinity of orchard , its a good afternoon walk to the museum and then head to orchard for shopping or to marina bay sands which is close by in the evening. There is a complimentary tour guide who explains the origins of singapura to modern day singapore and its short history."
,,Educational & Fun,4.0,,The kids enjoyed the new digital presentation 'Storey of the Forest' before entering the main galleries. The visual and sound effects are fantastic and relaxing. The other galleries focused on the various stages in the history of Singapore. üëçüèΩ
,,Beautifully preserved building with good exhibits,5.0,,"Exhibits are very nicely displayed, good experience here on the history. However there are very few relics/historical items on display here. So was a bit disappointed by the items on display."
,,Free entry on Sundays,5.0,,"There is alot of interesting information about Singapore itself and the culture in the museum, different rooms providing different time frames about tv, schools and the beginning of trade. Well worth a visit!!!!"
,,Relaxing (not for kids),4.0,,"Easy to walk going to the museum from the central merlion park. However, kids will be bored and might cause too much noise and chaos to the very clean, quiet and educational place. Best to bring someone who can easily understand instructions and historical elements.

We got this visit for free from our purchase of the Night Walking Tour."
,,Good Information about Singapore,3.0,,"it took almost 1 and half an hour to visit all the halls , fortunately the same time a wedding cermony was on in progress , so we had a chance to see some local traditional dressing and cermony too."
,,Interesting to learn the history of Singapore,4.0,,Decided to go here on a rainy morning. It is a beautiful building. The staff are helpful and friendly. Enjoyed learning about the history of Singapore. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Highly recommended for all visitors to Singapore.,5.0,,"Fantastic place to visit - learn about the history of Singapore. Very well presented in such a magnificent building (old and new). It bring back memories of childhood games (5 stones, marbles etc, not iPad). Join a tour - it is more informative, please check times and language."
,,Great for Culture!,5.0,,"A relatively new museum but very nicely done. Some bits are more interesting than others, but that's always the case for attractions like this. A great way to start learning about the history of Singapore, at least most recent."
,,"Beautiful, Educational Museum",5.0,,"This museum should be at the top of your list during a visit to Singapore. After a number of disappointing museum visits throughout Southeast Asia, I was wowed by the quality of the collections and accompanying explanations. It was great to learn more about Singapore and the Japanese occupation. There were also several very impressive exhibitions. Admission was free when we visited, but it appears that may have changed recently. Still, this museum is certainly worth a fee!"
,,Spellbinding vituual forest digital art installation in upgraded glass rotunda,5.0,,"Spellbinding virtual forest is a must see at the National Museum of Singapore.

As well as the watercolour renderings of the Farquhar commissioned collection of regional Singapore 19th century flora and fauna; new to the National Museum of Singapore is the virtual forest-- a digital art installation in the glass rotunda. Singapore has no equal when it comes to bringing the environment to life and while this installation will capture the imagination of everyone, it mesmerised the children. Visitors enter the dome. As you cross the bridge you are surrounded by tumbling flowers. As you continue to walk through the rotunda surrounded by the virtual forest the animals move in the forest, pouncing and crying out. At the base of the rotunda you can lie back on huge bean bags and observe luminous trees and flowers. I suggest, however, you get up and walk around the walls as the more people in the space the more trees and flowers there are."
,,Singapore History comes to life.,5.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore brings the history of Singapore from ancient times to today to life. Special exhibits cover changing fashion, the Japanese occupation and village life."
,,An insight into Singapore's hsitory.,5.0,,"This was a great museum that was very affordable at $7 for a number of exhibits. Having visited Singapore over the years, it was incredible to go inside and learn so much more about its history. the displays are brilliant and listening to Lee Kwan Yu's explanation for the formation of Singapore was very moving. Highly recommended for a hot or rainy day activity. Plan on spending a few hours here."
,,A good history lesson on Singapore,4.0,,"It was a wet day and we decided against the gardens that we had planned to visit, so we went to the museum. It was a good choice, as there is a lot to keep you interested. The tour is full of exhibits regarding the history of Singapore, and it seems very up to date. The restaurant is good for a light lunch too. It's well worth a visit, notwithstanding whether it's wet or dry out."
,,Disjointed,3.0,,"I visited this Museum after taking a wonderful tour of the Battlebox as it is very close to Fort Canning Park.

The lady on the desk was very helpful and advised me that a tour would begin at 1 p.m. if I would like to join it. She pointed to the spot where I was to meet the guide. As I had an hour to wait, I went and had a fish and chips lunch (S$16.00 ++) at the Terrace Caf√©. Unfortunately the fish, covered in thick batter, was almost inedible because the fillets under the batter were dark and slimy.

At 12.50 p.m. I returned to the place which had been pointed out to me but when no-one else had turned up by 1.20 p.m. I left and explored the exhibits by myself.

I agree with the previous reviewer who said that the exhibit which explains the history of Singapore is like a maze. I found it disjointed with no clear indication of the pathway to follow in order to view the displays. Therefore, I often found myself out of sequence with the timeline.

I had afternoon tea at the Food For Thought Caf√©, which was very crowded, before walking to Bras Basah MRT Station to catch the train back to my hotel."
,,"Huge building, limited and boring exhibits!",3.0,,"Entrance fee is discounted for those 60 years or older. Just show proof of your age.

I waited for the Guided Tour to begin for about 40 minutes, only to find out that the guide would be talking in Korean. There are only two floors of exhibits during my visit: Ground Floor and Second Floor.

The Gallery that shows the history of Singapore is confusing! I felt like I was walking in a maze! The exhibits at the second floor are broken down by certain time segments. Nothing there caught my interest!

Felt like the exhibits at the Asian Civilizations Museum are more interesting and entrance is FREE!"
,,Fabulous museum to get an insight into Singapore's history,5.0,,"We very much enjoyed the free history tour. There is an entrance fee but the tour was extremely good giving a very clear insight into Singapore's history and cultural structure, highly recommend"
,,Not an impressive collection,2.0,,"As a young city, Singapore does not have much of a historical heritage to offer in her museums. The architectural style of this building can be quite impressive, but not really its contents."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Good to have a great exposure to Singapore history. Get the tour for a brief and then go dig the contents. Do not forget the upper level floor with more actual historic facts.
,,Great start for Singapore visit,5.0,,"We loved it as did the kids (6,9,11) we didnt see all of it but spent there almost 3 hours learning the history of Singapore and more which was a great start for our visit here. Some is free and some is with symbolic payment. The cafeteria is great too and its in the middle of everywhere you go. We highly recomend it."
,,A first class museum,5.0,,"This place gets it all right - the exhibition spaces are entertaining - full of interesting objects, pictures and audio visual treats. There is a good mix of social and natural history, fair and unbiased descriptions of some contentious events, and generally a celebration of Singapores success and diversity. The building itself is a fine exhibit too, with excellent facilities and some lovely artworks outside and in the lobby. We spent 3 hours here and would have liked to have stayed longer. Definitely worth the entrance fee."
,,Very Interesting!,5.0,,"A very interesting museum of Singapore! Interesting facts about the history of Singapore and the amazing man who basically made Singapore, Singapore: Lee Kuan Yew."
,,Key to understanding the history and nature of the country,5.0,,"A fascinating museum which details very clearly the origins and culture of Singapore and puts so much of what you see in the city in a proper context. Well laid out, cool, excellent cafe."
,,Educational and well executed,4.0,,"This was our first visit to the National Museum after the refurbishment and we very much enjoyed it. The exhibition is very well designed with static displays and lots of interactive experiences, movies and ""shows"". It is very well executed and gives a good overview of the city¬¥s history. Definitely recommend it to understand Singapore..."
,,Interesting number of different exhibitions on offer,3.0,,We spent some time walking around the permanent history of Singapore exhibition (the Singapore History Gallery). It was certainly interesting and good to learn how Singapore came to be what it is today. We also visited the temporary 'What is Visible is not Invisible' exhibition which was more interactive and very enjoyable. Lucky we visited on a quiet weekday morning and had most of the exhibitions to ourselves which added to the enjoyment.
,,Enormous,4.0,,"This is not only a large museum but you need to spend substantial time looking at the exhibits, most of which are laid out in various unique display areas.

We chose to only see the permanent exhibitions housed over 2 floors and spent close to 2 hours in the museum.

There is also a nice coffee shop on the ground floor."
,,Singapore Introduction,4.0,,"First time in Singapore? Start here. Within an hour you get a very good understanding of Singapore. You can of course spend more time. You will get a far better understanding of the cultural mix of Singapore and its history as well as its people.

When you leave the museum you understand why names such as Bugis, Canning, Raffles, Stamford etc. are important to Singapore."
,,Very interesting but more history than nature,4.0,,We spent a good few hours looking at everything and learning the history of Singapore. This is a museum for history buffs as there was little in the way of flora or fauna on display.
,,interesting,4.0,,"If you are interested in the full history of Singapore, this is the place to go. Very informative history from the early 14th century through to modern times. Would recommend a visit. Entrance fee is reasonable."
,,Interesting,5.0,,"A huge building, it took a little while to find my way in, but worth persevering. Lots of history of local culture, both rich and poor Singaporeans and immigrants. Plenty of photos and memorabilia. A good well laid out museum. Restaurant was inexpensive and had a good choice."
,,Nice,4.0,,The building is very beautiful and its a great place for learning and understanding the development of Singapore which is very interesting
,,All of Singapore history in a few hours,5.0,,Excellent rainy day activity! The museum has an area devoted to Lee Kuan Yew that truly explains how the city state became such a cultural and economic marvel. Other exhibits describe life in different decades leads no up to the present.
,,Nice museum,4.0,,Interesting museum that covers Singapore's history by various eras. Nice architecture and well put together museum. Worth a visit.
,,A Purpose Built Museum,5.0,,"This grand Palladian structure provides plenty of exhibition space. Take your passport for a senior entrance rate. If you approach from the Fort Canning side it is not easy to get in as the ticket office is at the other side of the building and there are no signs to tell you this. However, once in it is well worth the visit with themed areas covering the history of Singapore."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Really a great museum that provides a well-presenting history of Singapore, along with many other traveling shows. The have several good restaurants on site also."
,,Too much info if anything,4.0,,Excellent history of Singapore in chronological and thematic presentations. Nice cafe and art exhibition BC too.
,,Fascinating!,5.0,,"We visited the museum primarily for me to get a photo of the stunningly beautiful building. However, it was bucketing down and we were tired, so thought we'd escape the weather, find a cafe inside and rest up for a bit. Very reasonable prices, so we bought tickets, found the cafe (there's also a restaurant) and did just that. Then we started exploring. It's wonderful, and the displays have been cleverly and thoughtfully arranged. Particularly enjoyed the History Gallery. Highly recommended."
,,Extremely well curated museum,5.0,,"We spent a bit over 4 hours here going through all the exhibitions. The museum is wonderfully put together, providing great information on the history of Singapore right up to fairly recent history (the 80s). We took one of the free guided tours first which was excellent, The tour takes you through the main history gallery. The rest of the galleries are very easy to self tour, the 2nd level goes through different time periods of the 1900s, the section from the occupation years is particularly touching. We also took in the current temporary exhibition in the basement, a very modern art exhibition that is very interesting.
We ate lunch at the cafe near the souvenir shop, the food was really excellent and reasonably priced, I can highly recommend it."
,,A history lesson in one place,5.0,,Every thing you want to know about singapore and its history is here great displays.videos and artifacts
,,Immerse yourself in history and culture,4.0,,"Spend a couple of hours exploring the National Museum of Singapore and you will walk away with a newfound knowledge of this intriguing country's history and people.

It is worthwhile spending the extra few dollars and purchasing a ticket which gives you access to the all of the special exhibitions as well (S$14). The What is Not Visible is Not Invisible exhibition in the basement gallery is particularly interesting (exhibition showing until 19 Feb 2017).

This is great activity if you want to escape the humidity or heavy rains!"
,,Interesting museum,4.0,,"This is the oldest museum in Singapore and it is quite interesting. We particularly enjoyed the Singapore History Gallery and The Modern Colony Gallery. We Built a Nation, the Gallery focused on Singapore's first years of independence, was quite small - but provided insight into the leadership of Singapore's first Prime MInister and government. The museum is fairly small so easy to navigate. There is, additionally, a cafe with a very nice menu.

The only negative comment I would make is that the schoolchildren visiting the museum were allowed to run rampant through the exhibits, yelling loudly. I was quite surprised they were not better behaved."
,,"excellent introduction to the people, cultures,and histories of Singapore",5.0,,"History buffs and folks interested in finding out about the people of Singapore will love this museum. Takes more than 2 hours to view the different eras described in video, artifacts, photos, letters, and great interactive sites for young and old. Great bargain, and has a senior rate to boot."
,,So interesting,5.0,,This place has atmosphere in buckets. It gives a wonderful history of singapore and also of the Occupation. I would expect people who have any link with this city should avail themselves of this great museum. Thank you.
,,Great!,5.0,,"I really enjoyed this place, a great way to spend a rainy day. Take the time to go here and learn the history of Singapore."
,,Double wow,5.0,,The best experience during our stay in Singapore. Shared the experience with lots of very well behaved local school children. A must see to understand Singapore
,,Do not come here if you are an alternative or Japanese person,1.0,,"Despite being more polite and quieter than other visitors. We were told that they could tell that we follow a ""Japanese"" culture and were not welcome here by the security, one of our goth friends was told that he looked like the ""devil"" and was not allowed to come in.

However there was a very friendly staff member in the gallery whom explained the meanings and origins of the paintings to us, she was really nice and understanding, it improved the visit a lot for us. :)"
,,Worth to visit! Very good free guided tour!,5.0,,"The museum is oldest in Singapore, so it sounds tell its story itself. The free guided tour is excellent, which help to understand the history of Singapore for around 1 hour. Everyone should check the schedule of free guided tour in the museum website. It is just ashamed if you miss the tour when to visit it."
,,From Swamp to Super City in 50 Years,5.0,,"Home to the world's most successful social engineering experiment, Singapore is a wonder whose story is told here. The floor plan is almost a maze of corners and byways, and tells the story of the founding of a small but mighty nation. Always cool and comfortable inside, the story unfolds of how a small backwater fishing village became the economic powerhouse it is today. It wasn't easy! Oppressed and occupied in WW2, Singapore gained it's independence only in 1965. If you're not a history buff, skip it. But, if you are a admirer of human achievement and determination, don't miss it."
,,Back into Time at NMS,4.0,,"History of Singapore re-written in Pictures, visuals, LCDs and real historical objects. Must visit place for first timers. It is worth the time taken from your shopping excursion. Educational and informative. Very modern display with a touch of history."
,,Loved the Story,5.0,,Enjoyed the historical story depicted as you browse through the galleries. The museum is historic in feel throughout and has been beyond well maintained.
,,Look and learn,5.0,,Come here to understand the history of Singapore. Absolutely excellent museum - enough said ! Great use of variety in display and exhibits. Nothing else in Singapore beats it.
,,Taste of History,4.0,,A visit to this beautiful building will give you an insight into Singapore's history and culture. Very well done.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,We were not sure whether to visit this museum. However the visit was worth it. Even if you are not the ARTY type do visit this place.
,,What a Great Surprise !!!,4.0,,"This was fantastic place to spend a few hours to learn about Singaporean History. As usual here, everything works. Well displayed, clearly marked and wonderfully organized. One of the better museums I have visited. Why am I not surprized. After all this is Singapore."
,,A history of Singapore,4.0,,"A nice museum giving the history of Singapore, we got the free guided tour which was good. If your after WWII history the Battlebox bunker tour covers the war in allot more detail."
,,Once upon a time in Singapore,5.0,,"The museum consists of two parts, which you can visit separately. One is a museum of art with changing exhibitions and in the other the history of the city-state of Singapore is presented. We visited the latter.
The emergence of Singapore is in an alternating manner shown by means of film images, slide projections, documents, photographs and objects with a story. We think that it is therefore also suitable for children over 8 years, but then as parents you can spend less time in the galleries. In that case you get less information about the background of the history of this city-state, and why things have gone as they have gone. The expos√©s about that we found fascinating.
In addition, we had the impression that as the history becomes more recent, this is dealt with more superficial (such as the union, and thereafter the break with Malaysia). This is logical when you consider that former choices and interests can still play a role in the current political situation.

For visitors who are interested in how the unique Singapore has arisen, we can recommend this museum. Expect a visit time of 30 minutes (with children) to 1.5 hours or longer if you want to take note of all backgrounds ."
,,"Informative, good for history buffs",5.0,,"This museum is not very large, but has a very interesting way of telling Singapore's history. Some of the exhibits take the visitor through the personal journey of individual Singaporeans and uses that as a tool to explain the history of the country, spanning over a thousand years, with more focus on the last two hundred years of course. This is certainly a rather unusual way of presenting history, and made it all the more interesting.

For anyone with an interest in history generally or in Singapore's history particularly, this is a very good place to start. The building is nice as well, and there are couple of places to eat on site, including a fine dining restaurant and a casual cafe style place (Food for Thought) where we had a late lunch. Since there are not too many galleries, it would take about 3 - 4 hours to cover. About a 10 min walk from City Hall MRT.

Highly recommended for history buffs."
,,Gorgeous space...,5.0,,...well-designed and curated collection. Truly an impressive museum. Definitely worth the time! I spend about four very pleasant hours there.
,,Disappointing,2.0,,Some of the spaces were great but things like the Occupation exhibition felt very superficial. Too little information.
,,Singapore's history,3.0,,"We got an impression of Singapore's history at the museum. In the basement there was a contemporary exhibition, mainly with video works. This will last until February 2017. Look for more reviews by MulleEllum."
,,1st time in Singapore? Then this should be your first destination!,4.0,,"Even if museums are not your thing, the National Museum of Singapore gives first time visitors to Singapore a great introduction to Singapore's history and the events (including political/cultural influences) that have given birth to the modern, independent nation today. The history of Singapore section can be easily experienced in 2 to 3 hours or you can spend longer if you desire to see some of the other artifacts on display. It's not a big museum when compared to the British Museum or the National Archeological Museum in Athens but the history display (a chronological walk through time) is very informative and interesting."
,,Great overview of Singapore's History,5.0,,"We went to this museum on the first day of our trip. We didn't know much about the history of Singapore, and this was the perfect place to learn about it. A tour was just beginning when we arrived, and we felt very lucky because the tour guide was really good. She knew how to move our group around the museum and we felt we saw all of the important exhibits with her. The museum is laid out beautifully and there are a lot of examples of memorabilia -for example a rickshaw, a sample kitchen - it reminded us of our favorite museum in our home city, the Oakland Museum. We highly recommend visiting this museum if you go to Singapore."
,,Really an Incredible Experience!,5.0,,"If you are a history buff, you will not want to miss this incredible museum! There is so much to see and experience ... great archives from the past about Singapore and the surrounding area. It was really a treat to meet the employees and hear stories of the past. Do not miss this!"
,,Very good museum on the history of Singapore,5.0,,"The museum had a temporary exhibit of artifacts from the British Museum that was well laid out with plenty of space to move about and take pictures.

The permanent exhibits were arranged in different halls according to theme. They had one on post WWII toys that was great, and other sections that focused on the history of Singapore. The choices of artifacts and the manner of presentation and lighting were very good.

In the photos I have in this review are a Type 95 Ha Go Tank replica, weighing 3.5 tons, was one of four built for the miniseries The Pacific. Its was based on an original in the from the Australian War Memorial. This flag is signed by Captain Kameo Sonokawa, the pilot who led the Genzan Air Corps in the attack that resulted in the sinking of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse. The anchor is from the RMS Empress of Asia, a troopship that was sunk and the captured crew and troops aboard the liner were shipped to Thailand and Burma to work on the Death Railway."
,,Interesting.,5.0,,There is a lot to see in this museum. It's also easy to access and set in congenial surroundings. There is something for everyone here.
,,Great building with easy to follow displays,5.0,,"We like visiting major museums as they can provide really good information about the country or city you are visiting. This was no exception and really told the story of Singapore from early through to modern times. The displays were easy to read and follow, as well as being rather interesting."
,,Nice but nothing really special,3.0,,"The museum have some informative items, but nothing really special. It is just like compilation of few informative stuffs in one place. So instead of searching in books about history of Singapore, one can just visit this museum to see some old photos, old movies or little stuff about olden days Singapore. There are some old drawings and also old and new paintings. The other museum (Asian Civilization museum) have more interesting things to see."
,,"Stunning building, too little content",3.0,,"It's important to remember that I'm coming at this from an Irish perspective and so I expect a museum to have a lot of old stuff, very old stuff! This one does not, I understand that Singapore is a young country but vast space is thinly furnished with exhibits from WWII and poorly edited shows about the great kampong fire, I understand that this is an important event but the details are explored exhaustively.
The building itself is wonderfully restored, all credit for this amazing job which marries the old a new in a world class example of how to restore and modernise an old space. I hope over time the management here with think outside the box and develop this museum to broader and more griping. Having said all that it's worth a visit."
,,Lovely building and informative displays,5.0,,"There are different sections to the museum with free permanent exhibits and ticketed displays, plus a foyer filled with kids activities. I only visited the permanent displays on the history of Singapore laid out over a number of rooms featuring different important decades in the nations development.
I learned so much and wanted more so also bought books from the bookshop."
,,Nice place to escape the heat during an afternoon and learn about Singapore,4.0,,"Very well organized exhibits, was not crowded at all during the afternoon, Free wi-fi was a nice touch. Spent 2-3 hours learning the (somewhat sordid) history of Singapore. Those damn Brits, lording over everyone!"
,,The Old and the New!,5.0,,"If you want to experience something unique, visiting the newly refurbished National Museum is a real treat. The building is an old one but the interior which was the courthouse has been completely renovated with a result of an A1 museum. Really incredible collection of Asian art pieces. The building itself is something to behold."
,,Good place to visit on a humid day,4.0,,"This was a very interesting exhibition, showcasing the history of Singapore through it's various name changes and occupiers. Excellent social & economic history of the development of modern day Singapore. Well worth the small entry fee."
,,Must Do!,5.0,,Worth seeing before or after your walk up/down Orchard Road. Enlightening and enjoyable visit which is well worth the time.
,,Well presented and informative museum! :),4.0,,"This is a very well laid-out, presented and informative museum. It is free for residents to enter, but foreigners will have to pay 10S$ for the entry fee and an additional 4$ for the special exhibits (I thought the experience was well worth the price though). They offer tours by knowledgeable and passionate volunteer guides in both English and Mandarin. Check with reception on the next available tour in your preferred language when you first arrive.

The special exhibit I went to called ""What is not visible is not invisible"", which is running from 7th October 2016 to 19th February 2017, was great fun as there was a room filled with green balloons. I was beyond happy and played in here for ages unleashing my inner child.

The museum covers the history and culture of Singapore from its days as Singapura to modern day Singapore. It was fascinating learning about all the different historical aspects of daily life such as the vintage clothes people used to wear, the food they ate and the toys children played with. I was actually genuinely moved by the poignant footage of Lee Kuan Yew announcing the independence of Singapore on that historic day in 1965. You could easily spend more than 3 hours at the National Museum of Singapore immersed in the interactive exhibits and having fun enriching your knowledge of Singapore! :)"
,,This museum is amazing!,5.0,,"First visit to this museum. Went in the afternoon period and realised that time wasn't enough for us to walk finish the whole galleries there. We only have chance to walk one gallery which is the Singapore history gallery. And it already took a few hours time for us to finish that one gallery. We both took around 100 and more photos in one gallery. We were kinda shocked. Knowing that, we will be back again next time to visit the other galleries."
,,"Great range of exhibits, very worthwhile",4.0,,Had a great visit to the museum which has a wealth of information about Singapore and surrounds. It is set out over a number of levels as you'd expect and we took about 2 hours to traverse all the exhibits. There is currently a photographic display which is well worth look. There is a cafe on site if you get peckish. We entered from the top level after checking out Fort Canning but you must proceed to the ground floor and purchase a ticket which gets you a sticker for your top so the security guys can tell you've paid. No entry to some of the exhibits without one.
,,nice old building museum,4.0,,"contemporary display content can told you a brief history of Singapore, the ground floor gallery are quite impressive."
,,Surprisingly Informative,4.0,,"Truth is, I was apprehensive about visiting the National Museum of Singapore (or any museum in Singapore) - I mean, being a local, we never really had a great impression of museums in our own backyard.

I must say, I was proven wrong. The museum was much better than expected.

The museum sits in a quiet corner in between the central business and shopping districts next to our Singapore Management University. The rustic building brings a sense of nostalgic feeling and stands out among the more modern buildings surrounding it.

Going into the museum takes you to a world different from the hustle and bustle of the city around it. I do applaud the wonderfully informative exhibits on Singapore's history and our road to being a developed nation. There is a mix of audio, video and displays which will keep you relatively entertained for a good 90 to 120mins.

I especially like (and this is for all locals), the new exhibit on our ""modern founding father"", the late Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew. It may have been a year but it still touches a chord and you get to see actual artifacts (clothes, bicycle, the famous red briefcase) of Mr Lee's life.

And as you would expect from the Singaporean customer service standards, the staff of the museum are friendly and helpful.

I recommend the museum to all, friends from abroard and locals alike, to visit."
,,History at its best,5.0,,"On the main road this beautiful building cannot be missed
After a routine bag search & an entrance fee $10
You enter a main foyer with elaborate staircase that leads off to many different rooms each marked clearly with exit signs
The rooms depict different eras and the evolution of Singapore
From the war & struggle thru poverty to modernisation
There is a coffee shop and i believe a sit down restaurant and a gift shop
I thoroughly enjoyed my visit
And wish the children had joined me"
,,Very educating and interesting museum,5.0,,"The museum is exactly what I hoped it would be. It takes you through the whole history of Singapore, from the first recorded activity of humans living there, through the colonization to the WW2 and when the country got independent and how it became the modern metropolis it is today. I spent 2 hours walking through the corridors and could have spent more time if I really wanted to read it all. A must visit for the history interested!"
,,Impressive building but slightly disappointing content for families,3.0,,We decided to visit based on other reviews that suggested this was quite a child friendly destination. While the building itself was beautiful we did feel that the majority of the exhibits on show when we visited were more aimed at adults (or at least teenagers). The sections on Singapore's history and cultures etc were well presented and informative with lots of reading and visual displays to enjoy. We just wish we didn't have two primary school age kids trying to hurry us along! On a positive we had a lovely lunch at the relaxed cafe on sites (especially the beef salad). Worth a visit if you are the target audience or have more patient/cultured kids than us ;)
,,Wonderful place to learn the development of Singapore,4.0,,We spent 2 hours in the main history gallery learning and understanding the development of Singapore which as very interesting. Perhaps not suitable for very young children. There is a cafe on the ground floor. The other galleries were add-ons from the 20th century showing fashion and life-style. We actually visited on a rare rainy day in Singapore!!
,,Must visit - 3 hours well spent!,4.0,,"Singapore has a relatively short history. The recorded part of the history starts from around the 15th century AD, and the National Museum does a wonderful job of presenting that - especially from the time of British rule. Getting to know how a small country made up mostly of immigrants climbed its way up to being one of the most developed nations in the world, is quite fascinating. The museum has lots of engaging video content as well.
The only thing we felt missing was that probably there should have been a comprehensive audio guide to help make the experience even better."
,,Good Overview of the History of Singapore,4.0,,"I visited the National Museum of Singapore on a weekday morning. It opens at 10:00 am. The museum's main exhibit is the history of Singapore, located on the ground level of the structure. It is a good place to visot to understand how Singapore came to be. There are other smaller exhibits in the museum worth visiting as well. At the time of my visit, there were several groups of school children on a field trip, so the museum was quite busy.

Tip: The 3rd level of the museum has an exit to Fort Canning Park. From there you can explore the park and visit the Battlebox, a museum/tour of a military bunker located inside the hill."
,,Interesting,5.0,,Gives a good view into Singapore's past and its growth over the years. Interesting for both locals and visitors from overseas.
,,Great interactive experience,4.0,,This beautiful neo-Palladian edifice built in 1887 houses some great interactive galleries depicting Singapore's history and culture. The Glass Passage which connects the old and new buildings rises four storeys and has a glass ceiling. Must see for history and culture lovers.
,,A fascinating introduction to the history of Singapore,5.0,,"The layout and set-up of the myriad of exhibits here is really outstanding. From the moment you enter, your attention is caught by the enormous map that changes, giving you an introduction to history.
Following around the exhibits, the amount of detail given, the way each item linked with the next, the use of space to guide you on your 'exploration' was brilliant.
The team that planned and set this up is to be congratulated.
A few more spots to sit and contemplate all the historical implications, would have been great."
,,Great museum,5.0,,Did an English language tour with a lovely guide. She knew her stuff and it was really interesting to learn about the early history of Singapore. Lots of interesting exhibits. After the tour I walked around by myself to look at everything again. You can spend hours there.
,,Insight,5.0,,"An excellent objective approach to the background and history of Singapore, well worth the time. If you wondered how Singapore got to be a success start here."
,,A must see to fully understand Singapore,5.0,,"A wonderful museum that traces Singapore from its humble origins, through occupation and war, to the amazing city that it is today. It's a great way to understand what makes the city tick and how the architecture has evolved over the years, realistically you need probably 3-4 hours to do the museum justice, it should be your first stop on a self guided tour."
,,"Visited 4 hours, went by fast",5.0,,"Great architecture. Galleries provide great excellent information on history and development of country from Genesis to present. Also has contemporary photo art gallery for free in center of museum. $10 sgd to go inside multiple galleries. If you like history, it's a must see"
,,Gret opprtunity to gain a better understanding of Singapore's history,4.0,,"We only visited the history gallery (though I'm sure there's a lot more to see we ran out of time). This was generally very well presented and certainly gave me the opportunity to gain a better understanding of Singapore's history. It might just demonstrate my ignorance, but I was very moved (and I will admit surprised) by the video of Lee Kuan Yew crying on live television when discussing the separation of Singapore from Malaysia."
,,A good overview of Singapores 50 + history,4.0,,Head for Dhoby Ghaut and take a short walk to the museum. Pay the fee 10 dollar ( 5 for seniors ) and take the interesting tour for an hour giving you a comprehensive overview of Singapore history. The displays are excellent with many video presentations. An hour well spent. Finish off at the cafeteria or at the fancy restaurang
,,Interesting insight to singapors history,4.0,,"It tells the story as you go around the museum. I thought there would be more historical objects to view, but its mainly videos, pictures, but letters and documented accounts of its history, bad times and progress. It was very interesting."
,,Well worth the $10,5.0,,"An awesome museum, full of interactive displays as well as the complete history of Singapore. Well worth the $10 entry fee, and you will easily spend a couple of hours there if you're not careful!"
,,Dimly lit but the subject matter is bright,4.0,,"I thought that I knew a bit about the history of Singapore, but the 90+ minutes I spent in the museum made me realise how relatively little I knew. What an informative place, well laid out and presented well. Just a bit too dark for me."
,,Excellent museum with guided tours,5.0,,"I wondered around looking at the excellent displays and then joined a tour. If you want to learn how Lee Kuan Yew created a modern city for his people, this is the museum to visit. Peggy was an extremely knowledgable tour guide and told the story of her beloved Singapore in a very engaging way. Unfortunately I had to leave the tour just as we got to the time of the Japanese occupation, but when I return to Singapore I will return to this excellent museum."
,,Great for Singapore history,5.0,,Really enjoyable and memorable museum detailing Singapore's history. I would recommend for all visitors.
,,Fantastic museum - well worth a visity,5.0,,A really good history of Singapore. Recently updated and with lots of information presented in different ways. Do go!
,,"Good info, but uneven presentation.",4.0,,"Although I am glad I went to the national museum, I was a little disappointed at the time and what was missing in the presentation. They glossed over a lot of WW2 and also the experience of the Chinese. I am glad I went to the Chinatown experience because it effectively rounded out what was missing in the national museum. The exhibits were good, but the tone was generally uncritical of the colonial period and the Malaysia. Issues. It is an encouraging stop, just not much use if you are looking for an authentic interpretation of Singapore history."
,,day trip,5.0,,the best museum in the world. offers guided tour if required with the audio device. A must for all young and old.
,,Currently covered in scaffolding,4.0,,"A range of exhibits and as I was there towards the end of Northern hemisphere summer, I got to see the events during the Singapore night festival."
,,Worth it,5.0,,Very good museum on the history of Singapore with great informative displays. We learned a lot without being overwhelmed by information. I would recommend it to everyone visiting Singapore
,,AN ABSOLUTE GOLD MINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5.0,,"If you come to Singapore---COME HERE you will not regret or FORGET it.There
is so much to learn ,so much to see & hear with the interactive headphones.Just so
much to learn about this small island nation that has been to hell & back.The effects
of the second world war & the clean up of the river & reclamation of land is explained in detail."
,,Walk through history,3.0,,"I went here as I wanted to learn about Singapore pre colonial rule. The displays are interesting and informative but I was expecting a bigger collection. The post WWII and modern history area did not interest me at all and my entire visit was over in about 40 minutes. Not much here for kids, and I was happy to move on."
,,Visit it to understand more about Singapore,5.0,,"Located in an old house that reflected a proud history of Singapore, the national museum was one of places we visited in our first day in the country. The galleries were absolutely amazing that took us back to hundred years ago to understand more about Singapore and its rich history and traditions. I think it should a must while visiting Singapore."
,,Awesome depiction of how a country became so developed & powerful in such a short time!,4.0,,"'Bird park was opened as early as 1971, it also has one of the world's tallest man-made waterfalls.' I came across such facts and many more in our 4 hours of visit to National Museum.

How to get there: We took Red line mrt. Got down at Dhoby Ghat and took Exit A. It is 5 minutes walk to National museum from mrt.

Tickets: We bought tickets from there, 10 SGD/ per head. Not required for kids below 3. Free for PR/ Singaporeans.

As we entered the building, architectural marvel welcomed us. As we walked further, we passed through a souvenir shop. On the left was a cafe but he head straight to the gallery at level 1. At the start are some rocks dating back few centuries, big wooden ship, some earthen vessels, jewellery and a wall playing a video.

As we proceeded further, things became far more interesting. There are various information boards, pictures, paintings. It starts when the land was Singapora to Crown Jewel (of British) to Syonan To (Japanese rule), Independence, merger with Malaysia, separation and a new identity.

The whole museum is amazing conceptualized and built. If somebody want to know how a nation is built from nothing to a great developed and powerful one within a generation - this is the story. Study everything, absorb and understand.

You will come out as an enriched person known much more about history, people, culture. Post separation with Malaysia and the way LKY (there is a 7 minutes video on a big screen) lead the country is only to be admired and learnt from.

Museum is blend of keeping things old rustic and at the same time embracing technology and modern depictions when time move to present one. Historical events are unfolded via pictures and few animations.

At one section in level 2, it is amazing to see how the evolution in society happened. How films were promoted, when theatres were built. They also have clothes and cutlery on display. Family values, example there were campaigns like 'Girl or Boy, two are enough' OR 'Second can wait' OR 'Teenage marriage means pushing into problems - depicting a young couple with two kids and a messy house; in 1970s. I found these fascinating. This tells what the society went through and how government played great role in building a mature society.

There are many more interesting stories to absorb here in the museum. You should have 6+ hours if you have great interest in knowing Singapore's history.

As for kids go, there is nothing much to offer. Our 3 years old son enjoyed at the begining but after 2 hours, he was kind of bored. Though we kept his interests alive by showing new new things, like range of camera, fighter tanks, clothes, etc that were on display.

You can take some really nice pics of yours at Level 2 with sun falling directly on you from the glass ceiling with amazing architectural walls and windows. Overall, we had an enriching time and it was worth a visit.

If you are a tourist with handful of days in hand to roam around, you may keep this at a lower priority. This is for those who enjoy and appreciate history, wants to know about Singapore and has ample patience."
,,Tempus Fugit Here-us.....!!,5.0,,"We posted in here around midday yesterday to escape the heat and humidity for an hour. We left just over 5 hours later. What a find! For $10 each we enjoyed the best learning experience ever about the history of Singapore and it's friends and foes, and each of their impacts on the way Singapore fits into modern society. The film of the really emotional speech by their PM in 1965 following 'annexation' from Malaysia almost had me in tears. Really well signposted and lots of touchy feely exhibits. Beautiful building too with places to eat and drink. A fabulous way to spend a few hours."
,,"interesting museum, worth a visit",4.0,,The National Museum shows the history of the city from around 1000. It shows the first occupations of the Arabs and European. Also recent history is discussed
,,An average experience,3.0,,The building looks fantastic both inside and out but that was really where the experience faltered. The museum was poorly organised and confusing in its displays. It was enjoyable enough but could have been so much better if better organised. I would personally avoid this one if in Singapore which is a real shame.
,,History of Singapore,5.0,,"This is an excellent museum to visit to learn about the fascinating history of Singapore, from it's very early settlers through to the dreadful time experienced during WWII, and the horrendous treatment from the cruel occupying Japanese, through to it's blossoming as a prosperous, modern country. The Singapore of today is only 51 years old, and all Singaporeans should feel very proud of their history and the fantastic country it now is."
,,Very nice museum to learn about Singapore's history,4.0,,"Very well made exhibit on Singapore's origin and history. The exhibit especially covers the beginning of the British colony, the 2nd World War, the path to Independence and the how Singapore grew to become what it is today."
,,Great insight into Singapore's history,4.0,,"Beautiful old building and light and airy inside. If you just go round and read the main boards you get a good insight into singapore and how it is as it is today. Staff were very friendly and it wasn't too crowded. A party of teenage schoolchildren arrived and in England they'd be noisy, running around and a bit of a nightmare but here they were very smartly dressed in their uniforms, quiet, polite and respectful of everyone else so don't be put off if a school party arrives when you're there! We treated ourselves to lunch at the very fancy fine dining restaurant there which was excellent. The surroundings were beautiful, food exceptionally good and service impeccable. Treat yourself you won't be disappointed."
,,very cool,4.0,,You will enjoy the architecture as much as the Art. Friendly staff Different to Western style Art Galleries and not crowded
,,"""An Architectural Icon""",5.0,,I was welcome to listen to a talk this August at the Singapore National Museum. I didn't know anything about the exhibition hall with the exception of on this visit. Happy to realize that I went to the the oldest museum and an architectural icon in Singapore. It's so awesome how the old design and the new are both seamlessly combined. Too terrible that I didn't get to tour the whole museum but will definitely will be planing another visit soon.
,,Insightful Look into the History,4.0,,I didn't know a lot about Singapore but the museum had an insightful exhibition that took the visitor through its recent history with some interesting artefacts
,,History is not boring,5.0,,"I visited this museum with my kids (13,18) and all of us learned more than we expected about Singapore 's history and culture. The set up allowed us to experience the museum as if we were traveling though time. Well worth the visit!"
,,Good museum about the history of Singapore,5.0,,Spent a few hours where. Very informative about the history of the city/state. Definitely worth a visit if you enjoy history and knowing about the place you are visiting.
,,History well preserved,5.0,,This is evidence of the British colonial building well restored and modernised .Good use of the facility and matters sustainability well taken care of
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"Thoroughly interesting history of Singapore, great lay out, with interesting visual and written exhibits. Would definitely recommend"
,,Nothing much to see,2.0,,The title says it all. I'm disappointed. There's nothimg much interesting except the video footage of Lee Kuan Yew. 20SGD is not worth it.
,,Historical and Worthwhile,4.0,,"Fantastic place to learn about Singapore's history. I spent about 4.5 hours here but could easily have seen more. There is a cafe in there but bring snacks if you plan to stay long. They have great bathrooms, water fountains, Wi-Fi and of course air conditioning. There is so much to see. Closest MRT station is Bras Basah but Dhoby Ghaut is walkable too."
,,Singapore night festival!!,4.0,,So awesome!!! Very creative. Come before it's over!! Lots of fun for young couples to families. All exhibits open and free.
,,Great place to spend an afternoon,5.0,,"$10 entrance and $5 for over 60's. Especially enjoyed the History of Singapore exhibit but found it quite dark in places - too dark to read the information panels!
Lots of places to sit and rest on your way around and in a beautiful building. Join one of the tours if you get the chance ? at 11 and 14.00hrs.
Nice helpful staff"
,,Impressive presentation of Singapore's history,5.0,,Placed in a beautiful building this museum provides a great introduction to Singapore's history from the very beginning to the present day. It shows the quick changes in Singopore's recent past and its stunning success. As a foreign visitor I found it very informative.
,,Interesting insight into Singapore's history,4.0,,We went as we had visitors over to stay and it is the perfect place to get an understanding of how Singapore has evolved over the years to become the amazing place that it is today. A must for all visitors that want to understand a bit more of the history of the Red Dot.
,,Great Coverage of Singapore History,4.0,,"I visited Singapore on business in June 2016. The National Museum of Singapore is a multi-faceted museum. I chose to focus on the part of the museum which covered Singapore's history. The sections on World War 2 and the creation of modern Singapore were the most interesting. There was also a special exhibit on the life of Lee Kwan Yew, Singapore's leader who is considered the father of modern Singapore and who passed away recently."
,,Beautifully curated,4.0,,"This museum beautifully presents a very ""cleansed"" version of Singaporean history and culture. The footage of Lee Kwan Hew discussing the establishment of Singapore is very moving."
,,very interesting,5.0,,came here some years ago and on a recent visit we see it has been done up beautifully. The displays and the tour is well worth doing. Singaporeans can be so proud of there heritage.
,,The Building is THE Gem,5.0,,"Unless you're an avid fan of history, and really want to know more about Singapore's short history, I would skip the paid exhibits and soak in the building, shops and rotating exhibits instead. The building's architectural design and materials is the history worth beholding. It used to be the Raffles Library & Museum and housed zoological collections that are now at the NUS Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. Both from within and without, there are many intimate details to find that instagrammable moment."
,,Lots to see and you can spend hours inside!,5.0,,"You need to pay a small entrance fee but there is so much to see. You can maybe spend 4 or 5 hours inside to cover everything. Very well maintained,"
,,A must do as part of your visit,5.0,,"We had 4 days in Singapore and really wanted to get a sense of the history and culture. We stopped here for a few hours and it was a fantastic way to get quickly up to speed on the city from birth to present time, including through wars, the changing of countries that Colonized the country, and how social life has evolved. There are 4 rooms that focus on specific eras In the 1900s that show clothing, furniture, pictures and a great perspective of the way of life. The too. Covering WWII was particularly interesting to see how things changed with the Japanese government. It was the best way to help my children ages 10 and 13 to understand more about this city than simply the tourist exhibits and prosperity we saw on our trip. It's part of the flexipass options and close to buses and mrt stops."
,,Great History of the Building of a Small but Mighty Nation! Singaporean should be so proud!,4.0,,"The National Museum is a 5 min walk away from the Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station, right next to the YMCA and very near Fort Canning Park. It is filled with exhibits through the growing years of a young nation. We took the guided tour that highlighted the Singapore History Gallery, taking us through the birth of the nation: the growing pains,occupation during WWII, independence, and so on. The tour was about 1 hour in length and we then left to explore the museum on our own.

The National Museum of Singapore has definitely given my family and I a deeper appreciation of Singapore -- a small but mighty nation. It is amazing how much thought and precision has been put into developing this nation. Amidst it's greenery and modern architecture, Singapore is weaved together by the commitment of a multi-cultural community seeking their common good and setting aside their differences. Singapore is so rich in it's culture and history - if you wish to see beyond the shopping, the hustle and bustle of the city, The National Museum is a good place to really appreciate the country.

(Thank you Barbara, our volunteer guide from the Friends of the Museums, for the guided tour and sharing your personal experience growing up in Singapore. You made our trip extra special!)"
,,Interesting museum,4.0,,"I wanted to know more about the history and the people of Singapore and this museum will enlighten you. It starts with the rock and ends with today. I have learned lots of things I didn't know before and history is presented in photographs, objects of the period, news reels and texts. For example there is a news reel of the surrender of the British to the Japanese and the table where they have signed, is there in the museum after you have seen it in a news reel. What I found very interesting to see is how they have forged together all these different nationalities into one people and how hard they have worked to achieve this and how proud they are of their accomplishments. There is also a reel with Lee Kuan Yew and you see how young he is and also how charismatic. I had heard his name before and now I know something more about his legacy. I can recommend this museum as you will understand the city and its people much better and where they come from."
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,"An enjoyable visit, the exhibition about Singapore history is very interesting. When I visited the museum, there was also the exhibition of the loan pieces from British Museum. An extra bonus indeed. The museum restaurant offers tasty food too, a good choice to take a rest and to sate your hunger."
,,Abbreviated history of Singapore,3.0,,The setting for this museum is spectacular in itself however unfortunately not enough of the building is on show. The museum is very well presented and provides a run down of the Malay Peninsular right through to independence for the Singapore state. There is very limited number of original artefacts to complement the displays - however there are numerous replicas and all is laid out in a very imaginative way. I spent around 2 hours here including a visit to the cafe. There are additional special exhibits which would take longer. I recommend if you are in the area and have some time to spare.
,,Musuem with a Class,5.0,,"Singapore's National Museum has transform itself as one of the ""must"" attractions to Singapore. It has rich and quality display of exhibits with latest layout and technology. Good for young and old"
,,Insightful History of Singapore,4.0,,The National Museum of Singapore is a great way to spend a couple of hours learning about the people and development of Singapore. Good for a rainy day adventure.
,,AMAZING PLACE,5.0,,"Had never visited here in the past.It was a short walk from our accomodation.Arriving at the admission desk I was asked by a young man if I was a senior citizen and replying yes but from Australia I was given half priced admission.The museum itself is a beautiful building.The displays at the present time being the 51st.birthday of Singapore are on the growth of Singapore from its early years,through the second world war to what is happening today.All in all well worth a visit."
,,For history buffs,5.0,,"This is a great history museum: a first stop to anybody interested in the development of Singapore from a fishing village and trading post, to a British colony, Malaysian holding; and independent state"
,,World class museum that employs technology in the telling of Singapore's history,5.0,,"Contextual displays take you through 700 years of Singapore history. A world class museum that employs multi-media to make history come alive for visitors. Join one of the free daily guided tours for a better understanding of the building's history and development of this city state from its beginnings as a sleepy fishing village to one of the world's most high-tech nations in the world.

Guided tours are free but admission applies."
,,Singapore's History,4.0,,"This is a beautifully curated museum that will walk you through the history if this amazing city state from its humble fishing village beginning to the financial powerhouse that is Singapore today. Well worth a visit. The building is also beautiful in its own right, beautiful Colonial architecture."
,,Great history of Singapore,5.0,,"This museum is cleverly organized to provide ""rooms"" or areas in which various aspects of Singapore's history can be explored. It is a beautiful building in itself. This is a museum that is not to be missed."
,,Invaluable history and information presented,4.0,,Gained a good understanding and appreciation for Singapore's founding fathers who no doubt turned a little island into an economic miracle in SE Asia. Be prepared to spend 4-6 hours just on the permanent exhibits. The museum occasionally show free local and foreign films.
,,Not as good as it used to be but still excellent,4.0,,I feel that their past (about 7 years ago) permanent exhibitions tend to be better. The museum is still excellent and worth a visit though. The architecture is beautiful. Hopefully I could be in town when there is an exciting temporary exhibition held or when the Cinematheque has a good array of screenings.
,,changing exhibits,4.0,,"Check online before you go, but the museum specializes in traveling exhibits, but does manage to have some local history as well"
,,Visited here for Great britain museum exhibition,5.0,,"I usually visit this museum for its traveling exhibition. It is well organized, you can expect to spend 2 hours in the exhibition."
,,Great place to get an overview of Singapore's history,5.0,,A favourite museum of mine as it is set out clearly to give you a great overview of Singapore from its inception up to the current day. Particularly good sections on Singapore's experience in World War 2. Make sure you don't miss the section on Surviving Syonan.
,,"Modern, interactive, and beautiful",5.0,,"So much I could say about this incredible museum. I'm just going to share two examples from my visit: 1) The Social Table. At the National Gallery, before entering any of the art exhibits, I stood at a large table with moving photos of various art works in the collection. It was a wonderful way to preview and familiarize yourself with the displayed originals. You could touch the screen and learn all about the piece, the artist, the school. . . It made viewing the gallery a personal experience. I'd turn a corner or enter a new room and immediately recognize one of ""my"" pieces.
But that's not all.
Also at the social table, you could tag the works you liked. For example, I started a file on Women in Singaporean Art. With a simple touch, I saved images in my folder. AND THEN I was able to open my folder and CREATE a poster of the works I selected. THIS I emailed to myself.
2) Children's art. This interactive feature was in the Children's section of the Museum. Titled ""Who's in the Woods?"" it invited children to design and them bring to life an animal. I went with four year-old Lauren who was perfectly able to design her elephant.
Once Lauren was happy with her creation, she could send it to live in the woods. It would appear on the enormous screen, walking, sitting, and interacting with other animals. I loved this. So did Lauren. She loved it so much, she created another animal, then another, and another. The woods were full of her colorful inventions.
Actually, I loved this exhibit so much, I created my own sweet elephant. She had a plaid bow on her head.
And if all of that wasn't enough, when I got home and logged in to my gmail, a 3-D copy of my elephant was waiting for me to cut out and assemble."
,,Well presented history,4.0,,Beautiful building. The walk thru Singapore's historical timeline is stylishly presented. We had gone to Malacca a few days prior and were disappointed with the quality and general lack of exhibits in the museums there. Found everything missing in Malacca in the Singapore Museum which was a pleasant surprise. My 10 year old son was fascinated by the WWII displays and spent quite a long time taking in every detail. Not too large so could squeeze in several other sights that day.
,,A beautiful museum.,5.0,,Housed in a magnificent colonial building this museum is spaciously set out with world class exhibits. The history section depicting life in different times is itself worth the visit.
,,History Brought to Life.,5.0,,"If you have only a day then DO visit the National Museum. Housed in a former Colonial building with a cleverly added modern extension this is a fascinating history of Singapore.
Brought to life with many exhibits spanning the whole of Singapore's past and present it is a fascinating walk through the relatively short time span that is Singapore , for my mind one of the best museum visits ever."
,,Interesting exhibits on history of Singapore,4.0,,Good overview of the history of Singapore from its founding to present day. Interesting artifacts from 13th century. Good foundation of knowledge for my kids to have gone through.
,,Highlights of Singaporean history,5.0,,Excellent display of the history of Singapore. Plenty for the children to see and do. Info and activities for children. Absolutely beautiful building. (A wedding reception was being held on the ground floor when I visited) Very impressive displays. Staff friendly and helpful. Discounts for jSeniors!! Reasonably priced.
,,Ok rainy day break,3.0,,Very nice building that has a limited amount of antiques to view. Mostly wall mounted reading and some interactive light screens viewing.
,,Educational and fun,5.0,,"It will be eductional and they have fun things for the kids. Adults will enjoy the history of Singapore and time to time , they will bring in other cultural and countries history artifacts."
,,One of the Best Museums in South East Asia,5.0,,"I visited National Museum of Singapore and was fascinated by Singapore History Gallery. It is one of the best exhibitions in the world stating how Singapore was founded and what happened along the way. Another exhibition that caught my attention was Surviving Syonan - Perfect Description of how lives were under the Japanese during World War 2.As i do not have enough time, i did not visit the whole museum but will love to come again."
,,Pretty cool! Very well-thought out.,4.0,,"Very large! Would dedicate a solid 2-3 hours to this, or if you're a big history nut, the entire day. I honestly didn't know anything about Singapore before entering this building, but I came out with a newer appreciation for the short but compelling history. It's very organized and deliberately planned in that you walk in and start at the beginning, and then walk out in a room that highlights modern Singapore. There are also several themed rooms with things like, ""growing up in Singapore,"" or ""women's history."" It's quite cool.

There's also a $5 if you're a student (works for international students too - just make sure to bring your school ID)."
,,Great way to get an understanding of Singapore,4.0,,"Visiting this museum gave me an insight into how Singapore has become such a great modern nation. I was particularly interested in the post-war period, but the museum goes back many hundreds of years. A great day out."
,,Great place.,5.0,,we only had a few hours to spare before we left for Sydney. This is a wonderful Museum and if you like Art this is the place. Lovely building also and it has lots of history.
,,Great place to learn about Singapore,5.0,,Excellent and modern museum in a beautiful building. The free guided tour was very informative. We learned very interesting things about the history of this place.
,,Very well done museum with several engaging option for children,5.0,,"This museum was excellent. The exhibits use all the modern perks to engage you, videos and listening options (that actually work) throughout. In addition to the regular exhibits there were several interactive stations that I'm assuming rotate with what is offered. Our children (3 and 10 months) really enjoyed the children's area and our 7 year old son was able to glean more information than he normally can by listening to the different exhibits."
,,Very Informative and Interesting,5.0,,This museum provides historical and cultural information in a very entertaining and engaging way. Singapore has a fascinating past and this museum is a must see when visiting.
,,Must see if your into the history of Singapore,5.0,,Such an amazing building to start with. You could literally spend hours just admiring the architecture of this magnificent building. The museum is great outlining the history of Singapore. Lots of interesting displays and interactive things to do. Great for kids with activities to cater for them also. Staff really helpful and friendly.
,,A must see to understand Singapore,5.0,,I visited the Museum for a couple of hours last Saturday before heading for the airport. The building itself is an attraction...tasteful modern architecture blended into a classical colonial period site. The exhibitions are an excellent way to understand Singaporean history and the multi-ethnic culture of this jewel of South East Asia. The sections on the Japanese occupation and on Premier Lee are fascinating and moving...Premier Lee had incredible vision; the world needs more leaders like him! Definitely worth a visit.
,,A well structured journey,4.0,,I was very pleasantly surprised - this museum is one of many in singapore but if you take the time to read at all the exhibits you will walk away richer for the experience
,,good architecture,4.0,,Went for the architecture. Nice...but not sure worth going otherwise...didn't hear good things otherwise about it.
,,Everything about Singapore,4.0,,"The museum is a bit far away from the train station and it will be good if to have a map with you if you are planning to walk there.Alternatively, you can take a bus from the train station to there.

there are several exhibitions in the museum on Singapore's history as well as a special exhibition which require additional ticket fees.

you can visit other museums around the vicinity such as the Singapore Art Museum (walking distance) or take a bus or train to Asian Civilisation Museum."
,,Overrated,2.0,,"This was a poor museum. It's very clean and well kept, however I thought the museum was not very good value for money at all. We payed $10 Singapore dollars each to get in and, frankly, the museum wasn't up to par to most FREE museums I've been too!

Completely overrated. It has 4 floors - a basement level, level 1, 2 and 3. Out of these 4 floors, 2 of them weren't even open for us to see and explore. Waste of time and money"
,,must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"was here last July 9, 2016 with my wife. Its a wonderful way of understanding Singapore, its history and what made it become what it is today. A must see in your iterenary in Singapore."
,,Terrific museum,5.0,,"This museum provides an excellent overview of Singapore's history. I really enjoyed the section on the Japanese occupation during WW2, which included many artifacts and stories from that difficult period. I also liked the sections on Singapore's development after WW 2.

The building has a beautiful atrium and several brides were having wedding pics taken during my visit."
,,Fantastic piece of Singapore history,5.0,,"Singapore national museum is a must go for history, art and heritage lovers. Beautifully restored and nicely preserved. Need a pair of good walking shoes to see the whole place. Great place."
,,Cool place in Hot City,5.0,,"$10 or $5 admission, a bargain! the old building is amazing, so well kept. the exhibits etc. are so informative. The ""new"" part is a great building too. Well worth a visit."
,,Skip It,3.0,,"SGD10 for tourist. Free for Singaporeans & PRs.

Although the exterior & interior of the building is an impressive colonial building but unfortunately the displays in the museum are not.

If you do not have much time to spend in SG, please leave this museum from your itinerary. I do not suggest even to those who have adequate time & money."
,,Excellent Facility and Helpful Staff,5.0,,"I was in Singapore over a holiday weekend and decided to get out and walk to some of the local attractions. I didn't know what to expect from a National Museum and was pleasantly surprised with the quality. For a U.S. Citizen it was an amazing opportunity to learn about the history of Singapore and especially meaningful to review the exhibits on the Japanese occupation of Singapore during WWII. I could not have received the same experience just reading a book. The exhibits are very well prepared.

I was fortunate to visit while a British Museum display was on site. The pieces from all over the world were amazing!!"
,,Interesting way to tell the history,5.0,,History of Singapore was nicely displayed. It's lively and interactive to apply visual technology into the display. Story of commoners were impressively included. The fee is decent.
,,best place to know Singapore,5.0,,Totally loved the museum. Got to learn so much history about Singapore. It's usually priced $10 but we went on a public holiday it had an open day (which we weren't aware of earlier). Worth a visit!
,,Excellent museum,5.0,,"Housed in a beautiful white building with excellent facilities the museum is well worth a visit. Very interesting exhibitions on the history of Singapore and occupation by the Japanese in WW2, nit to be missed if you are visiting. Also has 2 cafes."
,,My second visit!,5.0,,"Firstly I visited the visiting exhibit by the British Museum and then the permanent exhibits. Adults $10 for permanent galleries, interesting, lots to see and do, spent a few hours here, cafe is a nice place to stop and recharge, love the building!"
,,Nice to visit,5.0,,"one of the best spot for photoshoot in singapore i usually take this national museum for prewedding photoshot also charge us for about $150-200 for taking photo inside the buiding but if u are traveller,its free...."
,,A little history of Singapore,4.0,,"Spent a couple of hours in here. Interesting history of Singapore. I enjoyed it quite a lot. Cost $10, $5 for seniors."
,,Engaging Museum Experience,5.0,,"If you are interested in Singapore's history, archeology and overall development, this museum is top notch. It has a good mix of interactive and static exhibits, and was very informative."
,,Wonderful way to begin a city's visit,5.0,,"My first trip to Singapore, so I chose a visit to the museum to begin my stay. The English tour that morning gave me lots of good background information on the city/state's history that provided a solid background for the rest of my exploration of the city. Informative, entertaining, and air conditioned. ;-)"
,,What a Grand Building,5.0,,"We took the kids here and they had a fabulous time. There was interactive things for the children and the building and place was amazing. It is quite expensive to get in, and there is not as much artwork as other museums in Europe but it is worth visiting just to see the building itself."
,,Clear overview of Singapore's history,4.0,,"The museum gives a clear overview of Singapore's history from the earliest days up to independence. There are other, visiting, exhibitions to see for an additional price. Worth a visit."
,,Interesting visit could do with more exhibits,4.0,,Great building and interesting historical walk through but could have been improved with more early 20th century exhibits just seemed a bit sparse!
,,Great place to learn about Singapore's history,4.0,,"My school brought me to the National Museum to learn more about Singapore's history and to complete a worksheet. My group saw all kinds of things that we didn't know of! We saw the Singapore Stone with the strange carvings, for example. The museum was well made and the exhibitions were also nice. Recommended for history and culture lovers."
,,Excellent,4.0,,"Well worth a visit to see the history of Singapore. Recommend you take free tour, the volunteer guides are very good."
,,Great Activity,5.0,,"Visited the National Museum for the first time during my parents visit to Singapore. We saw an exhibition about the history of Singapore. It was very interesting and educational, but at the same time extremely well presented. Great activity to do in 2-4 hours."
,,"expensive, and not expansive",1.0,,"Very rigid, receptionists, lackluster exhibitions, nothing international, expensive. Not worth the money"
,,Singapore History Gallery and Life in Singapore Galleries.,5.0,,The museum is housed in a magnificent colonial building which has recently been renovated. The exhibition is well laid out and gives an excellent insight into the history of Singapore from the beginning. I got in as a senior for $5 which was such good value for money! Had brunch which was also excellent value for money. The staff were very polite and helpful which is the norm in Singapore from my experience. I recommend this visit highly!
,,Very informative trip,4.0,,"There is a charge of $10 for non-singaporeans. Have throughly enjoy the museum especially the free guided tours, it is available in English, Mandarin, Japanese daily on certain timings. They even offered French and Korean guided tours monthly. My personal favourite is the Treasures of the world and it is absolutely a must to join the free tour for a detailed explanation on the artifacts. Do note that Singaporeans adult need to pay $14 while students get to go in free. Be prepared to spend at least 3 hours in total."
,,Excellent collection,5.0,,"I visited the Museum specifically to see the ""Treasures"" exhibition from the British Museum, which was wonderful. I was very pleasantly surprised by the permanent exhibitions also and learned a lot about the history of Singapore. Very well presented - I particularly enjoyed the historic footage of the first Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew, announcing independence. The Museum is definitely worth a visit, I enjoyed it very much."
,,very interesting,5.0,,This is a fascinating museum . Certainly different to western museums . All very interesting material that showed quite an incite to Asian culture and a very different Singapore
,,Loved the installations,4.0,,The current artworks displayed were very fun and interesting to see. Very minimalist but superb. I recommend a 1-2 hour visit here.
,,Nice design and informative,4.0,,"British museum exhibit was interesting, especially the tour (from marina) was VERY good and i recommend to anyone! The rest of the museum was typical of Asian National musea, a bit propaganda and history but not really art or cool artefacts. Lots of screaming kids in the hall and not such a good cafe, dirty water, 'European' food and bored staff. Very nice building. Overpriced (20$) but i would gladly pay this for the tour."
,,Great place to Meet Singapore,5.0,,"Great place to spend a few hours (1-2 hrs). Theres alot to explore, the museum provides alot of information about Singapore history, fashion, lifestyle etc. Its not the boring kind of museum that you used to go."
,,"I'm not a big fan of Museums, but this one was AWESOME",5.0,,"I was very lucky to visit exhibition dedicated to the Father of Singapore - Lee Kuan Yew. There were some events held on the first floor: wedding reception in one hall, Leading Ladies of Singapore in the second hall, the History of the MovieMaking in the third hall and the Modern architectural PhotoExhibition in the fourth. The cute cafe was inviting with the smell of the fresh coffee and pastries. I think it's a perfect place for date. On the second floor it was a big exposition about life of an extraordinary pearson, who always worked at himself and never gave up. I LOVEd the museum and the love and RESPECT to life that you see in every detail, HOW people around care about that place. It was May and I noticed a box in the middle of the museum with the envelopes. Everyone could write down the letter to their mothers and the museum would send worldwide the letters for free. I wrote to my mom in Ukraine and she got it in 3 weeks! It was the best museum experience in my life."
,,So interesting and informative,5.0,,What a great place to learn about singapore! There is A LOT to see so make sure you have a few hours!! It is well set out and well worth it
,,Meet Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore has quite an interesting history to be learned and probably the best way to do it is to visit the National Museum. It has quite interesting permanent history exhibit. If you are a thorough reader it can take time.. But almost every piece displayed there has a story behind written so it is interesting to read. I've spent there about 4-5 hours and I liked it. It is a good way to spend a hot or rainy day inside with conditioning. There was also a temporary exhibit of Treasures of the British Museum. It was small but the pieces are priceless (from all around the world),"
,,You won't be bored,4.0,,"This is my type of museum. There are so many exhibits to see with state of the art galleries that can entertain you for an afternoon. It's open at 10am and there is a fee for foreigners depending on which tours you want to see. Check their website for more info.

For a country so young, Singapore has a very diverse and rich history. National Museum of Singapore is just a glimpse.

1 hour passed by too quickly and we didn't get to see all the tours. Would have stayed longer if we weren't catching a movie. The Singapore Arts Museum is also close by."
,,Well done with the upgrading,4.0,,"Haven't been here in ages and was pleasantly surprise with the upgraded look. Gone is the stark museum of yesteryear and in its place, themed galleries of different eras. I like the one with images and things of my childhood, brings back great memories; the one with Japanese occupation is great too as its images remind us the importance of national defense.

Well done with the upgrading."
,,Very interesting history of Singapore,5.0,,"If you go to this museum, definitely take advantage of the guided tour which comes at no extra cost. We had a great guide named Chong today who pieced all the exhibits and artefacts into a story about how Singapore came to be today, which was much more interesting than just looking at the descriptions! After the tour we were able to walk back and linger on sections we were into. Highly recommended!!"
,,Beautiful museum,5.0,,"Great collections of asian art, well presented, worth a visit Indian, indonesian, representative of their countries have found a perfect place to be shown"
,,Great Place for Learning About Japanese Occupation and Split from Malaysia,5.0,,This is a great museum for history. It is very strong on the split of Singapore from Malaysia and the Japanese occupation of Singapore in WWII. On these two crucial topics this museum is the top place in the world.
,,good weekend visit for a singapore resident like me,5.0,,"somehow the songs of cicadas paintings by Chua Ek Kay still stuck in my mind. i love the local artist's collections, and the free tour guide which got the tour to be very interesting. She is passionate about what she do. i begin to appreciate art and paintings more because of her. i would definitely come back again. the view from the top overlooking Marina Bay Sands is quite stunning."
,,I'm not even a museum person and I liked this one,5.0,,"This is a great place to learn about Singapore's history. It is not large and boring, but instead just the right size to spend 15 min or so in each room, learning about that slice of Singapore's history. Plenty of exhibits. I didn't bother with the British Museum portion of the museum, because I personally didn't really care to see the stuff that the British plundered from Singapore. I wanted to see what the locals found valuable. Nice exhibits and not crowded. Plus easily accessible from public transportation."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"History of Singapore shown in fascinating detail. It manages to be both historical and thorough without being laboured and dull. Great value for money if escaping the humidity, heat or rain!"
,,So enlightening,5.0,,"I loved this museum. I really didn't know much about Singapore history. I took the free, one hour guided tour, which was super helpful, and gave a great overview. Then, I spent a couple of hours on my own. I learned a lot, and found the exhibits really well laid out. The explanations on the walls were really helpful. I'm over 60, so I even got a great discount. I took the MRT there, and just had to walk a few blocks. There was a bus stop outside, and there was a bus that dropped me off right in front of my hotel. The guy at the front desk looked it up and gave me the bus numbers to take. I highly recommend this museum."
,,Super visit,4.0,,"I finally got around to visiting the National Museum after several trips to Singapore. After a wonderful (if humid) stroll through Fort Canning Park, the Museum offered a woderfully cool distraction. The History of Singapore section was nicely put together and informative. The temporary exhibition via the Bristis Museum was dull to be honest (personal opinion) but we had a good lunch and a further stroll around this impressive structure."
,,An excellent Museum,5.0,,There are unique items here that are a must see. Be sure to include the exhibits in the supreme court building that are now part of the Museum.
,,Wonderful Place,5.0,,"I really enjoyed my 4-5 hours there by myself. It is a beautiful building with great cleanliness, air conditioning and very informative free English walking tours. Cost for us outsiders is only $10 s. Definitely try to do tour because otherwise it is hard to find a path through that has any time sequence."
,,ok,3.0,,"Open House on National Holidays. A tiny museum with few collections , ok by Singapore standards small city / country."
,,Much more than just bits of old pots,4.0,,This museum was fantastic. The main area kept my interest the whole way. I loved the personal stories along side the country story. A really great place to learn about Singapore and how it came to be.
,,Beautiful Historic Museum,4.0,,"My husband love this history museum buildings (high ceiling), the exhibition and gift shop. We also had eaten at their restaurant Flute with a group of friends, manager very attentive, food were delicious (all base on historic therm) nice atmosphere. Should give a try!"
,,Re-acquaintance with the new national museum,5.0,,"2pm the guided tour of 1 hour started with volunteer Hui Lin. She was informative and reminded what it means to be Singaporean. Of course there is the British history exhibition as well in the 2nd floor which is interesting too. From 1570 to 1800s you have history of Sir Stamford to William Faqhuar. For me the real founder/starter of the place is William rather than Raffles. It's just more romantic with Raffles.
Within the buildings they have done a complete covered of the ""outdoor"" areas into air-conditioned play area and street side cafe served by Food for thought. And it has enough or something for everyone food wise. I enjoyed the quality of the museum and the shop as well. The entry was free of charge for Singaporean and PR and more if you included the British exhibits."
,,Excellent introduction to the history of Singapore,4.0,,I enjoyed this museum and found the early history and wartime section particularly good. Great place to go for a couple of hours if it starts raining. Various interactive exhibits and excellent interpretation made a very educational and enjoyable experience.
,,WONDERFUL HISTORY OF SINGAPORE,5.0,,"We spent a couple of hours at this lovely old, but fully renovated Museum last Sunday. We loved reading about the History of Singapore and we managed in that time to only finish the ground floor Exhibition. Next time we visit Singapore, we will return and go to the 2nd floor for the remainder of the Exhibition. It is well worth a visit."
,,Great information in a brilliantly curated presentation,5.0,,You get quite a full history of Singapore that is laid out in an intriguing way with lots of interactive displays as well as variations in the presentations. You can move from pictures to maps to animations to dioramas and on to video and solid objects. It's what every museum ought to be doing. Well done!
,,New landmark with great potential,4.0,,"South East Asia is in need of a well-managed museum in the likes of the MET, the Vienna museum, the Bostonian and the British museum- so when the National Museum of Singapore opened it was greeted with delight and encore.

Covering close to three floors, the National Museum of Singapore showcases its history and that of some its SEA neighbours. The Treasures exhibition held in conjunction with the British Museum is also worthy of a visit.

There are loads of activities for children as well and also survey forms for the visitors to give feedback.

The museum staff must be congratulated for their efforts on encouraging children's participation in the activities within the museum; audio, viewing movies, drawing and colouring. It was such a joy to see families being able to managed the kids well within the confines of this beautiful museum.

There are two restaurants; Flutes and Food for Thought. I love the gardens and marvel at how well kept the museum is. Great effort has been put into this. Keep it up!!!

Prices at the entrance could be lower."
,,Singapore History,3.0,,"Visited the National museum, this place is full of singapre history and currently how it has progressed. alittle too much at times"
,,Museum in Singpore,5.0,,This month they had some of the artwork from the British Museum. Some outstanding artwork. Great story about the creation of Singapore with the history of the Japanese invasion and killings of Chinese during WWII. It was all worth it.
,,brilliant,5.0,,"the history of Singapore is very interesting and cover many different cultures and centuries, a visit will give you a better understand of the country"
,,"free for locals, foreigners must pay",1.0,,"I didn't enjoy my visit to this museum much. You have to queue behind a pillar and can't see the prices and choices of ticket, so everyone has to work out at the desk what they want - would be better to have it displayed on the wall so you can decide while queueing. Then you would not spend 5 min in a queue to get your ticket.
They could not explain why foreigners pay S$10 but singapore residents get in for free (a practice that I don't agree with).
Some parts of singapore's history seem a bit glossed over - for example why they split with Malaysia got very little (almost no) mention. From what I read on wikipedia singapore was expelled from malaysia and that was certainly not mentioned.
The building was nice though, with a modern annexe attached to the old building, a good example of how to make use of an old building."
,,Superb museum!,4.0,,"Honestly, I wouldn't have came here, if it wasn't for the free ticket to go to the British Museum exhibition (I went to the National Gallery and brought a ticket for all the exhibition. They said I could see this British Museum exhibition for free). I only went to this museum and the National Gallery in Singapore, they are both very big and impressive, in terms of the architecture.
The British Museum exhibition is good if you haven't seen the 'real thing' in Britain. It is a smaller version of that. It's good if it's for free. They are all detailed and there are a lot of art/exhibits from different countries and eras.
I did not see any other of the exhibits, but again, I enjoyed walking around the museum."
,,Pristine and Informative,5.0,,"A pristine (like everything in Singapore!) museum in an incredibly beautiful building. The museum was so large we only visited the history of Singapore exhibit, which was detail oriented, engaging, colorful, and very informative. We joined a group tour and the guide was excellent, though the exhibits are easily marked and you could pass through them on your own and still learn a lot. We were very impressed."
,,Interesting,5.0,,"I wanted to learn more about Singapore and the history, This was the perfect place. I spent 2 hours here by myself and i could have spent even longer. Really a great museum with lots of interesting information for tourists (adults and children)"
,,One of the best,5.0,,"We make a habit of visiting museums of all descriptions wherever we travel and the this is definitely one of the better National Museums we have visited. This being our third visit to Singapore we were keen to learn more about the nation and its history. The museum takes you on a journey through history to the present day with informative and engaging exhibits that use a blend of visual art, technology and facts to convey the message. We spent half a day and could easily have stayed several hours more. Recommend exiting at the top level and wandering through Fort Canning park afterward."
,,A must for everyone,4.0,,Good atmosphere for all to learn abt the history of Singapore. A few hours is not enough. You need a few days to hv details touring of the entire place. Recommended to all young and old. It is my favorite place that I visit this place every year.
,,Intersting History,5.0,,"I enjoyed the museum a lot - it gave a great overview of the history of Singapore, putting a lot of things in context for me. I didn't do the temporary exhibit (quite a bit more money for what looked like similar art to what I've seen in other museums - Louvre, Ufizi Gallery, Met and MOMA) which might be worthwhile if you don't get to visit other larger museums and have more time to spend. I did the permanant collection in about 75 minutes."
,,The Museum,5.0,,Go there to see both the art and the building. Go there to the top floor (L^) to see the view. Go there to eat (L2) Violt Oon at the National Kitchen - the best food in Singapore.
,,Great Collection of Singapore History,5.0,,This grand building displays some of Singapore's great history. best to go at opening time to avoid the crowds. can easily spend a few hours there.
,,Interesting History,4.0,,The national museum of Singapore is a very good place to understand the history of the place. It has a huge collection of exhibits and are very well displayed with a nice introduction.The place is very well maintained and the people are ready to help.A great place for history lovers.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,I always love visiting a museum when in a new city. This was a terrific and amazing experience. A great exhibition of a wonderful nation's history - highly recommended.
,,A morning of SG hostory,4.0,,"Spectacular old building with lots of local history. I like to get a sense of the place i am visiting and this proved good insights without requiring too much time. Was a natural segue to then walk about Fort Canning park, right outside the door, and add context to what i saw inside."
,,Really interesting,5.0,,"Spent half a day in the museum, which was featuring treasures from the British Museum. These were interesting as a travelling exhibit, but found the three galleries about the history of Singapore much more more so. A great way to find out about the history of this fascinating multicultural city. The cafe inside is also excellent, with good quick service, good food and reasonable prices."
,,An enthralling and inexpensive outing,5.0,,"Visiting this museum was a truly memorable outing. You can sense it will be something special from the moment you put a foot on the first step in this truly beautiful building. The museum offers a fascinating insight into the history, cultural, social and commercial development of this fabulous city state. Great way to spend a few hours."
,,Worth the $5 admission for International visitors,3.0,,"Go during the heat of the day when you need a break to cool off. Nice museum, on the small side. Certainly worth an hour or two."
,,Impressive building and very interesting,4.0,,"Worth a visit. Provides a walk around, read-a-lot style of delivery of information. Gives you all you need to know to understand how Singapore came to be and the problems it has encountered along the way.- entry cost was minimal making a visit a low cost option in what is otherwise an expensive place. If you like history (like me) it's a don't miss attraction."
,,an excellent history of Singapore,5.0,,"We took the guided tour which was an excellent view of Singapore life and history. The presentation is extremely well done, especially the modern history aspects, even if you view it without a guide. Upstairs is the wonderful Farquhar collection of natural history drawings. We could have spent all day here."
,,Interesting time spent,5.0,,I thought I would spend an hour looking through the museum but ended up 4 hours later very tired but very very happy as the museum is well worth your time to visit.
,,Excellent Story of the Formation and Politics of Singapore,5.0,,"A good museum with lots of exhibits documenting the rise of Singapore from the early trading days through its days under British administration, under Japanese occupation, as a colony and finally an independent state after a short spell as part of Malaysia. Very well laid out and informative well worth a few hours. The ground floor is more traditional with the upper floor set out as individual rooms covering different time periods. Concessions available for seniors."
,,Singapore's History in one place,4.0,,"Beautiful building on the outside, which combined modern and victorian style structures within. We only went to the history of Singapore section of the Museum, but spent a good 2-3 hours in there, exploring Cingapora's history from it's origins to present day. A must if you want to find out more about the place!"
,,Singapore then and now,5.0,,"The thing that stood out to me the most when I went there was the difference from back in the day to present day Singapore. It sure has come a long way in a short span of time.

Definitely worth a look and plan to spend at least two to three hours there."
,,Treasures of the World exhibit,5.0,,We went only for the Treasures of the World exhibition gallery and its totally worth the entry price. Remember to carry your HSBC credit card if you have one. That buys you the cheapest ticket at $10 each. Cheaper than even the child/student discount. Saw Egyptian artefacts now after seeing them in the Cairo Museum. Awesome mummy!
,,A to Z Singapore,5.0,,"If you love spend a whole day in museum, this place suits you. To go around a whole museum you must spend at least 3-4 hours. This museum brings you the history of Singapore from A to Z. Again, you will be amazed how Singaporean preserve their history and culture."
,,"Fantastic Museum, Fantastic Building",5.0,,"The museum building is just wonderful, the way the museum is set up is very impressive and also very logical in the way it takes you through the SG history. Don't miss the upper section where they have rooms set up in different history periods where you can get a great feel for what was happening in SG at the time."
,,Surprisingly enjoyable.,5.0,,It was fascinating to see how much Singapore has changed. The difference between Singapore and Malaysia is also marked. Educational and well worth the $10 admission fee.
,,More interesting than I was expecting,5.0,,"You might think Singapore has not been around that long, so the national museum is not going to be interesting, but actually it is. It starts in pre-history and goes all the way up to near present-day. The historical footage of Lee Kwan Yew getting very emotional during the split from Malaysia is unexpectedly moving."
,,Must see place for those who have no idea about Singapore!,5.0,,"And also for those who want to refresh or broaden their knowledge. The museum is really modern - my favourite part is the historical one, you need 1-1,5 hour to walk through the historical part and to see and read everything - and it;s worth it! History of SG is depicted in a very clear manner. I usually attend free guided tours, I did so here as well but the museum itself has so many additional features and the guide goes to quickly, so I think in this case it's actually better to wander around alone, although our guy was an educated and nice gentleman."
,,Wonderful historical perspective about Singapore,4.0,,"We visited the Singapore National Museum early during our visit and we're pleased to have gone here. Singapore is a truly amazing place with very progressive culture and governance. This museum explains how the nation was born and evolved.

The museum should be a must see for all history buffs or for anyone interested in learning the importance of a few key individuals in creating this amazing city state. It's inspirational to learn how 2 Visionary leaders good shape the fate of this community and ultimately transform a little fishing village into the fantastic country that we see today.

Dedicate about 2 hours to tour the museum and if possible try to catch one of the guided tours that are available for free. The museum entrance fee may be one of the best deals in this city."
,,Understanding Singapore,4.0,,"I found this museum really informative. My parents lived in Singapore in the 1950s and I had my first couple of years there until we left in 1960. I find the country amazing in all it has achieved. I agree, the LKY speech when Singapore broke away from Malaysia is extremely touching. I recommend that all visitors to Singapore should visit the museum and gain a sense of Singapore's history and how it values racial and spiritual diversity."
,,Brilliant venue to understand the mosaic of Singapore,5.0,,"For anyone interested in the history of Singapore, a visit to the museum is a must.
The building itself is very welcoming and the timeline museum layout takes you from the beginnings when early settlers have appeared, thro the colonial past, the WWII and finally post colonial period. There is an excellent tv footage of the moving LKY speech towards the exit which should not be missed.
There are maps, paintings, pictures, old film footage as well as old guns and articles to give a good background to how the mosaic of modern Singapore came together."
,,With kids,1.0,,"A big let down given all the hype. Kids were bored to death! Impressive exterior but felt ""hollow"" inside. Not a family type museum. No family friendly affordable restaurants either. The children's play area was pitiful. Should really learn from the more interesting Australian museums."
,,Place to understand Singapore,4.0,,The most touched scene is LKY's speech. Because of his contribution that Singapore become an organized and diversity country.
,,Must visit!,5.0,,"not only is this a stunning architectural renovation, true to the building's past, but the art collection is fascinating."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Been here several times. A real eye opener, charts the history of Singapore very well with the history of the British in an incredible interactive exhibition. Will go here every time in Sing for the experience and reminder of how things were ..."
,,gorgeous,5.0,,"Beautiful building, inside and outside. There was an amazing exhibition of treasures from the british museum, which we greatly enjoyed."
,,Great Historical Perspective,4.0,,"This was our first trip to Singapore and I knew very little about the history. The museum presents many exhibits dating back to the very early years of existence. I came away with an understanding of the multicultural influence of this wonderful island country. In some parts, a little more signage could be useful. Overall, it was a really good experience, highly recommended."
,,excellent museum,5.0,,"very-well documented, good reconstitutions, full of informations about the history of Singapore, from the origins to today. you can pass several hours if you go on levels 1 and 2"
,,so so museum,3.0,,"Nothing impressive being exhibited in this museum, though the look of this building is impressive, but otherwise dull museum."
,,Very informative,5.0,,Well worth the visit even if you are not a huge historian as it's always good to learn more about a country when you visit. Very easy to get to and a must see if in Singapore.
,,Interactive museum,5.0,,It was a nice place to visit. We joined a guided tour and it was very interesting to get to know about the history of Singapore. My kids got plenty to see and touch without getting in trouble :-)
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,"A very good museum, well laid out, with good exhibits and in a very nice colonial building. Thought the entry fee of $25 was a bit steep, but we did get to see the traveling exhibit from the British Museum included for that price."
,,Outstanding Museum,5.0,,The museum is outstanding and focuses on Singapore history and life in Singapore. Recommend spending two days at four hours each day if you want to see everything.
,,Fascinating history tour,5.0,,"My visit was solely at the request of my wife but a guided tour that lasted over two hours convinced me that this is an essential highlight for Singapore.
Staff were helpful and passionate about their exhibitions and facility. And the wealth of knowledge about Singapore was perfect for a visitor - including pre colonial era (much more interesting)"
,,Basic history,3.0,,"I enjoyed the special exhibit of items loaned from the British Museum as well as the permanent collection on Singapore's history. However, I wish the museum had a more exhaustive collection on colonialism in Singapore. I expected a little more on the 19th century history, including more artifacts.

The gift shop was also disappointing."
,,Helpful to understand about Singapore,5.0,,This museum is really beautiful and help you understand clearly about Singapore. A nice country. We spent half of the day here and definitely worth a visit.
,,Excellent indoor activity - for those hot or rainy days,4.0,,"Great retrospective of Singapore's long history as a trade area and colony into current day. Interesting objects on display such as a Revere Bell donated by Paul Revere's daughter, paintings, history of Chinese gangs, and even an opium bed. Traveling exhibit from British Museum was in basement, great collection of items from all over the world."
,,A good starting point to understand help understand Singapore,5.0,,"The museum is a beautiful building that is a blend of modern and colonial architecture. It is a really well done trip through time to understand how Singapore become what it is today.

During my visit was an exhibit of pieces from British museums which was also quite comprehensive."
,,700 years of Singapore's history in a single visit,5.0,,"Singapore's oldest museum has been beautifully restored. Lovely selection of artefacts. Whether is it to a walk down memory lane or rediscover some lesser known aspects of Singapore history, there's certainly new things to discover."
,,Ok. Good summary of history.,3.0,,"The History of Singapore portion was interesting for a quick summary, but it's hard to encapsulate history without trivializing, and perhaps even mislead. It was good to see artifacts from the different periods, particularly the collection on Chinese secret societies, and the collections representing aspects of Singaporean life in the upstairs exhibits.

I'd recommend reading a book or short history primer while you're in your home country instead, and pop in if you happen to be in the area than a dedicated stop."
,,A lovely place to visit,5.0,,I really enjoyed my visit to the gallery. Not too many other visitors meant you could see the exhibits easily. Very well arranged and good mixture of statues and paintings. Great art from around Asia. Very full of light and life.
,,nice building and history lesson on singapore's recent history,4.0,,"beautiful building and takes you through the recent history of singapore, including world war 2 and japan's invasion."
,,Good Historical Summary,5.0,,"We arrived just as a free tour was starting, and while we could have visited on our own and read about each of the displays, this was a quick and easy way to see the highlights of the collection. This museum is a great introduction to the recent history of Singapore and should be on every visitor's list. It is modern, well organized, and gives a quick understanding of the important events that have shaped this modern city."
,,Very educational,5.0,,Good historical and social history of Singapore over the past 100 years or so. Allow 2-4 hours for this visit. Easy to follow route through the museum.
,,Wonderful Museum,5.0,,Top architecture. The spot was all picturesque. Nice natural light through the museum to enhance the beauty of the exhibits inside.
,,Excellent History Lesson of Singapore,5.0,,"I did not know much at all about the history of the country, and the museum goes back a couple hundred years so you get a good sense of the region and what was going on leading up to the formation of Singapore. Great exhibits!"
,,Interesting to see.,4.0,,"The main exhibition area covers a short history of Singapore from ancient times to British colonial, and up to the present time.
Interesting and informative without beeing overpowering .
The additional bonus at the moment is the exhibition held in collaboration with the British Museum which has pieces Greece Egypt, Asia, Americas etc."
,,A Nice Way to Spend 3 Hours.,4.0,,"We went here and saw all of the exhibits and came away with a lot of knowledge and respect for Singapore. There was also an exhibition on loan from the British Museum that had some interesting artifacts from all over the world, mostly Ancient Egypt though."
,,A must visit place.,5.0,,"The museum showcase the history of singapore very well.The exhibits were fantastic some were also interactive. The museum guides and staff are very knowledgeable. As you walk through the museum, you will really feel like you are travelling back in time. As the exhibits are quite extensive and there are several galleries, do allocate at least half a day if you plan to visit the museum."
,,Best to do at the start of your trip,5.0,,"Wish we'd done this tour early on. It was wonderful to see and hear all about the struggles Singapore had over many years. Very informative and well played out. Didn't get lost at all. Only about$18 Sgd ( senior fee), bargain. The small, but wonderful, treasures of the world exhibit(ends 29 May) was well worth it as well. It's another gorgeous building, spotless. Many helpful guides as well. We spent 3 hours on a cloudy, hot day in perfect A/c temps. Def a must do...."
,,Beautifully done,5.0,,"Spent an enjoyable 3 hours wandering around today - visited the small but excellent Treasures of the World exhibition and the 100 years of Singapore History gallery.

The treasures from the British Museum were indeed from all over the globe. What an interesting selection. From Australia, Africa, Middle East, Europe, America - with many artifacts from Polynesia and Micronesia too.

The History of Singapore was very well done - displays/audio/visual. From its formation to modern times with emphasis on the Raffles era and up to the end of the Second World War.

Did not have time to do the top floor justice
- but will make another visit next time I am back."
,,Very Imaginative And Informative Museum,5.0,,"We spent a couple of very interesting hours in this fine museum. The displays are extensive and imaginative, and cover a wide range of Singapore's history. These set the development of the island from ancient times to the present day, using a wide variety of physical recreations, artifices, and images. A very worthy National Museum, suitable for all ages."
,,Best Ever with a tour guide,5.0,,A must see with a tour guide. We had a very informative tour guide who also answered questions on culture and politics. The story telling brings you back in time. I learned so much about Singapore from the local point of view.
,,Really interesting trip thru Singapore history,5.0,,We spent a couple of hours here going through all the galleries. We particularly enjoyed going through the rooms devoted to the history of Singapore. We used the MRT and the bus to get there - was really easy.
,,Intriguing step back in time...,5.0,,"Housed in an incredible colonial style building, the NMS brings together the past and present of Singapore in a way that is both interactive and fun. Definitely pay the extra to see the 'Treasures of the World' exhibition-- so many cool artifacts from the ancient world, even non museum lovers will be mesmerized."
,,An interesting insight into Singapore's history,3.0,,The museum is located in a magnificent building located in the centre of the city. It includes a section covering the history of the island which is well laid out and informative. Well worth a visit for an hour or two.
,,Best place to learn the history of Singapore,3.0,,"If you are a tourist or first time living in Singapore, this should be your first place to visit above anything else. You will learn how this country was formed and how this country became a multicultural nation."
,,Glad we came,5.0,,"We were impressed last year with a very basic exhibit of Singapore history being shown as the museum was being renovated. I'm so glad we could return to see the new exhibits in the renovated museum. Very impressive depiction of Singapore history. Worth a return on the next visit. We spent two hours and wanted more.

We were disappointed in the special exhibit of British Museum artifacts. Items taken out of context and simply displayed is not my idea of a curator's job."
,,Wonderful Exhibits,5.0,,"The special exhibit ""Treasures"" from the British Museum is spectacular and well worth visiting. The artifacts from ancient civilizations from Rome to China are of the finest examples of jewelry, sculpture, pottery and religious relics. There is also a tour of the History of Singapore exhibit that is worthwhile to learn about the development of the city from a fishing village, through the 2nd world war to modern times. There are restaurants and a small gift shop in the air conditioned building that has a modern wing attached to the original Colonial building."
,,Very good museum,4.0,,Lots to see here and plenty of information about the history of Singapore. Worth a visit to stroll through the galleries. Plenty of seats to sit and admire the displays from.
,,"The British Museum exhibits are a ""Priceless' must do.",4.0,,"First of all the National Museum building is architecturally so stunning.
There was the most fabulous photo exhibits displayed...each photo was soul stirring. I am unsure of how often the exhibits change.
The British Museum exhibits from around the world are stunning...
I thought the focus lighting on these priceless exhibits could have been much brighter. It was a bit difficult to read because it was too dark.
It's highly recommended even if you are not crazy about museums."
,,Great exhibition about the history of Singapore and very nice cafe too,4.0,,We only went to the exhibition about the history of Singapore (which you had to pay to see and I believe is only temporary) but this was worth it if you are interested in reading about the history of this region which we were. The cafe/restaurant in the museum was a pleasant surprise - amazing food (menu not counter food) which meant it was pricey - but worth it.
,,Visit the Singapore History museum,5.0,,A perfect place to learn about the history of Singapore. The other sections are also quite interesting but just that one is worth the effort.
,,Love it,5.0,,We spend the morning learning about Singapore history. I love the way they have organised the rooms by years and the way they show their history! very entertaining!
,,Great way to learn about Singapore's history!,5.0,,This is a very interesting museum. It really gives you an idea of Singapore's history. The rooms are organiced by years and you will find all around the museum audios with personal experiences of local and foreigners. I recommend this place if you are interested to find out about Singapore's history!
,,A good place to start your visit,5.0,,Visited here to learn more about the history of Singapore. A good size museum with interesting and informative exhibitions. Well worth a visit.
,,You Must Visit to Find Out More,5.0,,"If you want to know more about Singapore, it's history and how it came to be - then head to this place. With both historical information set in a modern and interesting setting, you will find out a lot more about this city. Be sure to visit first - before you visit anything else."
,,Great museum to learn about Singapore's history,5.0,,"Housed in a beautiful Victorian building, the NMS is a must-see for anyone curious about Singaporean history, which is traced from early indigenous peoples to modern day. The displays are well done and informative, making them great for visitors of any age."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"A beautiful colonial building that has been restored to new heights of grandeur, the National Museum hosts a very strong permanent display of Singapore history and temporary displays of world class exhibits through partnerships with other museums worldwide. The Singapore history section is free for Singaporeans and rich enough to take up a few hours. I enjoyed it and plan to go again."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"This is a really BIG museum and you get to find out a lot about Singapores' history. The price for the tickets was ok, too."
,,Great insight to Singapore history,5.0,,This was a great place to be. Gave history of Singapore and we throughly enjoyed it. Gave us an insight to how Singapore developed over the years to where it is now.
,,Great Exhibition of Singapore History,5.0,,Anyone wanting to know more about the history of Singapore should visit the museum. Sunday is free for all visitors.
,,Great exhibitions on the history of Singapore,5.0,,There's a small charge for entry but once inside there are very good exhibitions on the history of Singapore which are extremely informative and well done. They often have a very good visiting exhibition which was from the British Museum on the occasion of my last visit so I gave that a miss.
,,So lucky to have a look of the treasures of the world,5.0,,"We went to the National Museum of Singapore yesterday. Certainly, we could get to know more about the history of Singapore there. Out of my expectation, there over 200 treasures from the British museum being exhibited there. We saw a mummy and many other treasures from all over the world. The visitors could take photos of the exhibits without flash. The exhibition will last till mid-May 2016."
,,Very impressing,5.0,,Fantastic buildings renovated some 10 years back. The museum itselves very interesting with the focus of Singapores history itselves rather than the daily lives.
,,Interesting museum,5.0,,Excellent place to visit to gain understanding of Singapore history. Some wonderful displays. Well worth the time.
,,Historic Building with great exhibits,4.0,,Preserved architecture and technology making apparently unfettered access to all kinds of art related to Singapore make this a marvelous venue. Go to the roof garden.
,,A comprehensive history of Singapore,4.0,,This museum provides a comprehensive history of Singapore. It has quite a bit on the occupation but it is the later events surrounding its gaining independence which I found particularly interesting. Easily accessible by MRT this is definitely a must-visit if you want to find out more about Singapore.
,,Fantastic venue,5.0,,Explore the past to appreciate what we have today. Singapore is the Jewel in Asia's crown. What a top spot to relax and soak in the history.
,,Excellent insight into Singapore - thoroughly engaging,5.0,,We visited this museum on our first day in Singapore and are very pleased that we did. There are a range of perspectives and good use of different interactive techniques to engage the visitor. Also an excellent place to escape the heat of the day
,,Great Focus on Singapore History,5.0,,"This is a wonderful museum in a beautifully restored building, with a strong focus on Singapore's history. Don't miss the room showing Singapore life during WWII, This facility has both permanent exhibits as well as temporary exhibitions from time to time. Keep in mind Singapore museums offer a considerably-reduced entry fee for tourist seniors."
,,An excellent location to enjoy local history,5.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore, located across the road from Singapore Management University is an iconic building that you must visit. Enjoy the local speciality exhibitions or relax with a latte over a great book in the downstairs cafe. A must visit. Lifts for strollers but wear a carrier if you are seeing an exhibition. Some of the formats are not made for ease of viewing or with the crowds - travelling."
,,Good Overview of History of Singapore,4.0,,They did a good job describing the origins of the country....very interesting. In the basement there was a travelling display available at additional cost.
,,A really interesting place to spend a few hours,5.0,,"We were interested in seeing the museum's 'Treasures of the World from the British Museum' visiting exhibition, which had a good selection of representative artefacts from all regions of the world. However the National Museum itself is well worth a visit at any time. The Singapore History Gallery on Level 1 is a visual walk through time from the early history of the region through to the modern city. Level 2 has several small permanent galleries on themes including including 'Growing Up' in Singapore the 1950's & 60's and 'Surviving Syonan' about life during the Japanese Occupation in WW2. A really interesting Museum for both locals and foreigners and well worth visiting for a few hours."
,,Important Singapore Historical Insights,4.0,,"The National Museum is located in a colonial dating from 1887 but has been beautifully restored with a modern addition in 2006. The galleries tell the story of Singapore's history and culture. There is an entry fee of 18 Singapore dollars. There was a special exhibit of treasures from the British Museum where we spent most of our time. We did spend some time in the Singapore exhibits, that were extensive and detailed and requires hours to absorb all the information provided. There is a caf√© on the premises."
,,super place steeped in English history,5.0,,"Lots of history, shopping and restaurants. Air con a must as hot and sticky constantly. Very clean - no trouble. Bars and restauants close early at 9.45 pm"
,,worthwhile trip,4.0,,Went there last Sunday the first time and had a good time there with the family. The museum is absolutely state of the art and give a very good overview of the history of Singapore. The special exhibition with treasures from the British Museum was a bit odd since the pieces were all pretty nice but put together in a bit of a random way. The kids enjoyed a story telling session that we was very well done. I have learned a lot about the short history of Singapore which was really insightful.
,,Interesting insight into the history of Singapore,5.0,,This is a beautiful museum that you should visit to gain a better understanding of the history of Singapore. Just like the rest of the city it appeared that every detail was throughly thought out and overall it was very well organized.
,,Interesting.,4.0,,Very informative and interesting. It describes Singapores history very good. Easy to overview. I think this museum has something for all ages.
,,The history of Singapore,5.0,,"A fantastic story-showing the history of Singapore! They built up a very educational exhibition how this fantastic city became what it is today! It is really worth visiting, almost the first thing youshould do, so you can understand and upraciate this wonderfull city."
,,A simple history of Singapore,4.0,,"I was intrigued to spend a couple of hours in the Museum, learning about the founding and growth of the island state. A most worthwhile visit, although I do believe that some of the photography, notably of POWs at Changi, were misleading"
,,History,5.0,,"When go in museum, can see many history of country , coins and place , from time to time got what changes , the most important is better bring along kids , this will get them know about everything's . Have air-con and they will felt comfortable ."
,,Singapore at a glance!,4.0,,"The museum is not very big but its good if you want to know Singapore at a glimpse. I was lucky because when I visited there during February 2016, a special show was running named 'Wonders of the World' with the collectibles from British Museum. It was great to see all the ancient artifacts of Greek, Egypt, Parisian and Inca civilizations. The main museum is also good with very nice representations of Singapore history, culture and development through artifacts and info-graphics.
Liked the overall experience and would recommend to others as well."
,,Wonderful concept of melding two older buildings with glass and galleries featuring light but beware of stairs,3.0,,"The buildings are beautiful and even a non-architect like me could appreciate the feat of adding a huge glass covering to unite these two very old stone buildings. It is a unique experience to visit it and the tour is well worth the time and money.

However, two caveats: there are many stairs and it's not always possible to use elevators to get from one place to another; given all the space, I thought there were surprisingly few works of art displayed. The latter may have been because they were redoing some areas and there other kinds of exhibits to see.

Still worth a visit while in Singapore."
,,A good intro to Singapore,4.0,,"As someone who knew very little about the history of Singapore, this was a good intro for me. The exhibit on the first floor covers the entire history of the country. I did not have enough time to see the other exhibits."
,,Dont visit until they have finished the refurb,3.0,,This museum has a lot of interesting material about Singapore history but todays visit was ruined for me by the fact that they were refurbishing the only cafe that could have sold me a drink and it was closed. So i arrived dehydrated and gasping...More
,,Beautiful melding of old and new architecture,4.0,,Lovely repurposing of an older colonial building with a modern extension at the back. Interesting galleries on Singapore history and life under the Japanese. However light on history about prisoners of war in Singapore during WWII.
,,Very interesting and informative,4.0,,"The musuem has several galleries and until May also a special exhibit from the British Museum. You could pay for either or buy a combined ticket which we did and it was worthwhile. The British Museum exhibit was a selection of artifacts covering the globe,...More"
,,Highly recommend,5.0,,"We were there on a day with free entry. I think it had just opened again after being shut for an extended period of time. Regardless, I would still pay to go in. The exhibitions were interesting and not too 'flat'. Lovely building too."
,,Worthwhile visit,5.0,,"There was a lot to cover in a very large, well laid out building. We only went to the Singapore history gallery and life in Singapore galleries. Plenty to see and discover. Good eating area."
,,History of Singapore,4.0,,"This museum had the history of Singapore, from its basic beginnings as a trade hub for all the neighbouring countries, then to its Japanese invasion, its multiculturalism and mixed influences to how it came the city of today."
,,The building is the star.,3.0,,Okay so we have seen some of the best museums in the world and did not have great expectations for this one. The building is beautiful colonial architecture. The local history was adequately set out but in rather old fashioned static style. The visiting exhibit...More
,,this is reviewing Treasure of British Museum ONLY,2.0,,Please note this is not a review for the museum as a whole but a warning to those thinking of buying a ticket to the Treasure of the British Museum. I would expect for the price that there would be a whole floor of exhibits....More
,,Currently have some interesting exhibitions,5.0,,"Originally went to see the World Press Photography exhibition. Ended up staying most of day to see other exhibitions. Enjoyed their Treasures of the World from the British Museum, which was free if you were born in the Year of the Monkey (take proof). They...More"
,,Great Start to A Singapore Visit,5.0,,Spent a couple of hours in the museum. The building itself is rich in colonial history. The displays present the history of Singapore in a way that a first time visitor can really get a grasp of this amazing city / state. Admission price was modest.
,,Beautiful and worth a visit,5.0,,Contemporary art from Asia displayed in 2 beautifully restored historic buildings. We enjoyed the architecture as much as we enjoyed the artwork. The docents are mostly pensioners that enjoyed sharing their thoughts on the artists and were very proud of this newly opened museum. Make sure you have a drink or meal on the 5th floor restaurant with the best skyline views of Singapore.
,,Great place,5.0,,This museum is really good and quite cheap. It is a great incite into the history of Singapore and has interesting exhibits.Clean toilets and good cafe.
,,Not to be Missed,5.0,,"If you want to understand anything about how Singapore came to be, do not miss this museum. It tells the history in an interactive and delightful way. The exhibition is recently completed and can be seen in an hour and a half."
,,Singapore history well presented,5.0,,"We enjoyed everything about the Museum, lots of interesting things for all ages and tell the history of Singapore in an excellent way."
,,Modern Style themed museum,5.0,,"This museum is housed in the original colonial museum and a modern purpose built additional wing.

Large open areas give a feeling of grandeur to the museum which walks you through the history of museum from early times through the various colonial eras, the war years and occupation by Japan and ultimately the rise of the modern Republic of Singapore.

A very interesting collection that when taken along with a couple of walking tours, gives you a good picture. The depiction of the occupation years are surprising in their subtlety with little mention of the atrocities of that period.

You will need a minimum of 2 hours to do it justice - we took 3 hours. There is an admission fee for foreigners."
,,Interesting Exhibitions,4.0,,They normally have an interesting exhibition on here at any one time. Worth a visit because it is an interesting colonial building with a couple of nice cafes.
,,"clean, peaceful, rich & royal experience!!!",5.0,,"Flute Restaurant & Bar is there, Singapore first private British Museum is there, gift shop stamp by Singapore National Museum."
,,A Good Museum but Expect to Pay Multiple Admissions,4.0,,This is a very comprehensive museum that try's to be too many things to too many people. They have special exhibits (which require a separate admission) and two permanent exhibits which feature another two admission prices. I recommend telling the people at the information counter how much time you would like to spend in the museum and asking them which admission you should pay. We just toured the main museum and there was plenty to see there. I found the exhibits on the Japanese occupation during WWII to be most interesting. An especially good venue for a rainy day.
,,"As the name says, it's the National museum...",3.0,,"Went here to see how Singapore as a city has developed. I didn't think it would have been different from how the nation did, but apparently it is. A lot of good exhibition items on wars, politicians and e.g. daily life. Less so about commerce or the city itself (I actually learned more about the way the city has grown during a river boat cruise than a two hour visit here). On the good side: it's decently sized, with the Singapore section doable in two hours or less."
,,"Small, organized and well presented",5.0,,"Before entering this tastfully renovated colonial building, my family knew little about Singapore's history. The entrance fee was reasonable and there was a 50% senior citizens discount for my parents.
Each room covers a distinct era of the city/state's history. My wife is a museum buff and said more than once that it was one of the best (if not THE best) history museums she's visitedin terms of presentation of information.
Not only were there photographs and text (multiple languages) but there were multimedia, interactive, multi-sensory (even smells) included."
,,No Parking at the National Museum of SIngapore,3.0,,"Your visit to this museum should be more enjoyable if you do not bother driving there. Their website states that limited parking is available. I did provide feedback directly to the museum recommending the website be corrected to state that NO PARKING is available. Even if you arrive before the museum opens, you'll find that the few parking spaces at the front of the building are all occupied by staff.
The British Museum currently has an exhibit on loan in the basement. The permanent collections provide a history of Singapore.
This museum is well worth a brief visit and lunch at Food For Thought or Flutes, but if you hope to enjoy your visit, don't bother driving your car there."
,,Terrible Lighting of Exhibits,1.0,,"The lighting of the exhibits is very poor, you can hardly see the items. The cards will describe features in the items that you can not see because the lighting is so bad. I am sure that the items are interesting and many are beautiful, but it was a struggle to see the detail in most of the items."
,,Superb - well worth a visit,5.0,,"The National Museum was mentioned in a brochure about Singapore which I found at my Hotel. I believe it used to be a Library, but has refurbished as the National Museum. Great use of an older building, and so glad that they upgraded rather than demolished it. They've done an amazing job, and the layout and displays were amazing. In addition to the specialist exhibits, there was also a focus on Singapore's history through to present day which was a fascinating insight. If you have a few hours to spare, well worth a look."
,,Lot of information to read,3.0,,"When ever i travel to a country i tried to visit the meuseum. They provide you a electronic pad with information on each and every artifact displayed. I found this facinating at the beginning but there were 100 odd clips and i didn't have time to visit all the 100 and listen to the descriptions. i must say i had few good laughs when i saw few artifacts. One was the kenwood master chef, singer machine, telephone.. they have kept it in the museum and my mom still has this kenwood master chef. Also i have seen the other machine and the good old telephone in somnay households i vist. Singapore has come along way."
,,Great overview of Singapore History,4.0,,"This museum is very well done. Evidently there is an entire kids' floor, but unfortunately it was closed when we visited."
,,Singapore through the years,4.0,,A very good place to know more of Singapore's past and how did these shaped the Singapore we know today. Very informative as the design and atmosphere will really bring you back to that era..
,,Big museum with permanent and temporary exhibits,5.0,,"NMS belongs to the museums of Singapore that are worth checking out. The building is classical with contemporary additions. There are exhibits (permanent) that give you insights in Singapore's history and life. And of course there are temporary exhibits.

Sometimes they have movie showings outdoors, under a huge banyan tree.

I'm not impressed by the museum shop nor by the museum restaurant."
,,So much to see and do,5.0,,We visited the museum in January 2016. What a superbly informative and interesting museum and a must visit place for visitors to Singapore.
,,Exemplary museum,5.0,,Impeccably organized and kept - as everything else in Singapore. I admired a tribute to late Lee Kuan Yew - a real founder of this country. As well as an exhibition of dresses.
,,Important to appreciate Singapore,5.0,,It¬¥s good ehibiton about the history of the Island. Staring in the beginning until post WW2 are.Very educational.
,,Museum of Singapore history is well worth the visit,5.0,,"Excellent museum of Singapore's history. As an American, I was embarrassingly ignorant of the country's history. But Singapore's history is fascinating, especially its remarkable development in the last 50 years. I really enjoyed this very well-done museum."
,,A good way to spend the afternoon...,4.0,,"Alight at the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station (5 - 10 minute walk)
Free entrance for Singaporeans.
Chargeable for the special exhibitions that change periodically.

You need to get your tickets at the entrance, so just re-cap with the staff which are the free/chargeable exhibits.

Gorgeous historical building that's been renovated. Interior looks spanking new, modern touch with lots of natural light.

My fav was the ""Voices of Singapore , 1975 - 1985"" exhibition. Takes you back in time, with items on display that remain true to how things were back in the day, including a re-creation of a small drive-in theatre and old-school movies. You'll smile and cringe all at once (in a good way of course!). There's also a bicycle on display that once belonged to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during his youth - a nice touch that adds depth and authenticity to the exhibition.

Not sure if the younger kids below 10 years old will enjoy visiting the museum as some of the themes / exhibits may be a tad adult for them but still worth walking around. I bet some of the young ones will enjoy the ""Voices of Singapore"" exhibit like me :)

Lots of photo opp: natural light | dome-shaped ceiling at the entrance | spiral staircase on Level 2.

Small souvenir store on Level 2; items with a local flavour that Singaporeans and tourists alike will appreciate (think small pouches and coasters stitched with the Sarong Kebaya motif). A tad pricey but makes for a nice souvenir.

I used this visit to explore the surrounding Stamford Road / Beach Road area and nearby museums (eg: Singapore Art Museum) - all within walking distance. A good map is all you need. Start early at 10am or 11am and keep walking!

,,Proud of Singpore Story,4.0,,"This visit, plan to travel around museums. This place is first of me to go. With the building that used to be government house.it's take over years to renovate and redecorate on exhibition.

Museum is very excellent on telling their story through living life, tradition and history over 50 years of establishing. There is 10SGD for fee and tour guide in 2 hrs for round.

Should come, recommend"
,,Grand old building...loved this place,5.0,,I found the National Museum very interesting and full of history. Four floors to view and take everything in. Learnt a lot. Recommend this place for sure...well worth a visit. I got a seniors discount which I was happy with!
,,Absorbing Visit,5.0,,"What an interesting and well thought out museum. The 3 hours we were there for just disappeared in the absorption of the culture , history and evolution of Singapore as we know it today. The story was told in a variety of ways and often interactive. Fascinating! Cafe ok too."
,,Treasures of the World - British Museum Exhibit.,5.0,,"Very well done exhibit. I saw this exhibit on a tour - which was good and given it was only an hour, insufficient for viewing the entire exhibit. It will require one and a half to two hours to get the scope of this exhibit - and it is well worth it if you are interested in an historical view of our planet.
For young children, there are lots of activities they can do there.

See it before it leaves at the end of May"
,,Great overview of local history,5.0,,"You should visit this your first time in Singapore to get an idea of the history of the area. It is a well-designed, easy to navigate museum with great signage. The grounds are also lovely."
,,Enjoyable Afternoon,5.0,,Very nice museum with interesting exhibits and good location. Sits on the river. We enjoyed a couple of hours in the museum (could have done more!) and then walked along the river back to our hotel.
,,Thought-provoking afternoon at the museum,4.0,,"Have been to the permanent galleries before, so I visited the current exhibitions on Treasures of the World as well as the very interesting World Press Photo exhibition (the latter with free admission). The latter was particularly memorable, what with the vivid images and stories via photojournalism all over the world. Truly a provocative and eye - opening exhibition that I was very glad to have gone for."
,,Charming Building houses interesting display,4.0,,"I have been to nany museums in my travels and this one stands out for it's charming setting and exhibitions.My husband and I visited on the advice of a friend and we weren't disappointed. We choose the Singapore History Gallery and it was well presented with great original footage of events.my only criticism is that it is laid out in a slightly confusing manner, lots of nooks and crannies , so it is easy to lose track of one's direction.Well worth a visit and within Fortress Hill park area so many other things to see there as well."
,,Awesome! Don't miss this!,5.0,,"One of the best museums I've ever seen! Amazingly well done, so realistic! Even the smell changes when you wounded through the different times!"
,,Surprisingly good...,4.0,,A good respite from the humidity. Spent a few hours going from room to room...interestingly curated. Shame nothing from the origins of Singapore which I saw elsewhere
,,Educational and fun,5.0,,A nice trip though the history of Singapore. I took the guided visit and I highly recommend it. You get lots of explanation and insight you wouldn't get otherwise. The restaurant is quite good for lunch too.
,,The Youngest Museum In Asia?,5.0,,"Not the biggest or has the oldest pieces inside but considering this wonderful island since independence is just 50 years young, this place should be on your visit list. Even the building iotself is just worth the walk around."
,,Free every Friday Night!,4.0,,"If you want a free entry to the museum, you can go on Friday night as they will open certain sections for free. It's also free during the Singapore Night Festival which is held annually on August."
,,Worth your money!,5.0,,"Entry is $10 but it is worth it. all the galleries are packed with interactive displays. It was almost too much to do, but if you have fewer time constraints it is easily a morning/afternoon filled!"
,,A good place to see the history of Singapore,3.0,,"There is so much to see here. There is no place to really sit when you are tired. the 800,00 year old tool was fascinating. The staff were pretty helpful but unfortunately the gift shop was pretty had some pretty tacky items. Would have preferred to have quality items for sale."
,,Fantastic but noisy,4.0,,Wonderful travelling exhibition from British Museum and the permanent history of Singapore exhibits...spoilt by two noisy European tour guides for cruise ship clients almost shouting their information to their attentive audience. How about some silence to allow the other clients to appreciate the exhibits and read without interruption? Let them talk outside the exhibit and be quiet inside. Please !!
,,Great way to begin a visit to Singapore,4.0,,This well organized and interesting museum presents an enjoyable story of Singapores brief history. The building is photogenic too. It is an excellent primer on the city that helps one appreciate the context of sites you see afterwards.
,,"Exquisitely Engaging, Charming Narrative from Historical to Present Times",4.0,,"The National Museum is conveniently connected by City Bus. The Exhibits covering Singapore are Laid out over 2 Floors & cover all Historical Events, Occupations/ Living Mores & Social Customs of successive Generations over 600 years. Photography is allowed without use of Flash. The Military events of Japanese Occupation during World War II are covered in detail. The Distinguished Life & Matchless Contributions of the Founder of Modern Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, are described in great detail. A Liesurely examination & observation of all exhibits will need the entire Daily working period - 10am to 5pm. Singaporean Food is available within the Museum at a Spacious Food Centre. Visitor's Fee is Reasonable. This Museum is a Must-See for anyone interested to understand the Origins & Motivations of Modern Singapore people."
,,"Impressive, especially famous women exhibit,",5.0,,"Visited during the soft launch following refurbishment. Beautifully laid out, interesting exhibits and guided process through different time periods of .Singapore's history. Fascinating. An unusual touch is the famous women of Singapore exhibit which honours women of all origins and in all walks of life and business. Thought provoking and well done. You don't need to be a feminist to be impressed!"
,,Worth a visit!,4.0,,It will give you a nice prospective of the history of Singapore. I was there when they had a special exhibit from the British museum. It was well worth a visit! Not a huge place. Allow 2-3 hours.
,,Singapore trip,5.0,,"The visit to this newly renovated museum was one of the highlites of the trip! I do recommend a guided tour, which is free. If you can, try to have lunch before the tour as the coffe shop in the museum is a little bit expensive. The renovation and the construcual work that went into it is very impressive. Will definitely be back next time when in town."
,,U must visit this museum,5.0,,"U can not finish your trip to Singapore without knowing the wonderful and inspiring history for this country . It's a great journey to see how this country has been transformed in only 50 years , very inspiring place"
,,National Museum,4.0,,Lovely building with a modern annex. Only display things related to history of Singapore. Excellent for everyone to learn how Singapore developed over the years. Non-Singaporeans need to pay. Next to Canning Hill which is excellent for a walk in a quiet oasis among the bustle of a city.
,,"Great history in a beautiful building, well worth it.",4.0,,We paid $25 for access to all the exhibits and enjoyed our visit. The history of Singapore was well done and you could also go on a guided tour if you wanted. Enjoyable.
,,Wonderful,4.0,,"While the website indicated we would have had to pay $60 for admission to the permanent exhibits, we ended up paying only $25 so don't let the prices deter you unnecessarily. We also found spending 2 hours on Level 2 was barely enough time and it was fabulous! My daughter found the scents piped in to complement the era so evocative and captivating that she just wanted to stay all day. The museum shop was also full of wonderful souvenirs."
,,"The building is very nice, the collections are worth seeing",5.0,,"If you have already found my small comments usefull.....

Hope you won't miss the ones linked to Singapore.

During my 3 days in this big big city I had in mind not to miss this museum and one or two other things.

This museum is great. Take a jacket the airconditioning is really high

Its architecture is really interesting with its junction of a colonial antique building and the modern cubical added aisle."
,,Interesting museum on Singaporean history,3.0,,The museum offered an interesting insight into the history and origins of Singapore and its peoples. It is located very close to MRT station and is just a short walk away from Raffles City. Recommended for a quiet afternoon with air-conditioning.
,,This is a beautiful building must see,5.0,,The fact they preserved this building is wonderful but to walk through and enjoy historical reference and beautiful art is a treat!!
,,A great history lesson,5.0,,"Yet again, Singapore, through all its modernity and presentation perfection, has managed to beautifully present its (little) history through the various sections in this museum. Unfortunately, much of it was under renovation when I went, but I did learn a good lot about Singapore and its place in SE Asia through a tour of the museum. Some cute books on Singlish and postcards are also available up in the store."
,,Awesome !,5.0,,"This building is a national treasure in my opinion . I was one of the guests invited to the opening of the Singapore Fringe Festival 2016 to see White Rabbit, Red Rabbit play and the space happily seated over 200 people . The rest of the museum looks incredible also !"
,,Fantastic Museum,5.0,,"A wonderful place to spend half a day. The exhibition about the History of Singapore is especially eye-opening and excellently curated. Worth the price of the ticket alone. Also the section of Singapore's famous ladies through the ages. Not being from Asia we were not aware of all the details surrounding Lee Kuan Yew and what a truly incredible man he was and the amazing amount of good he did for Singapore. An absolutely fascinating story. The gift shop has a interesting mix of souvenirs, some of which were not seen elsewhere in Singapore. Beautiful building, well-maintained and all of the staff we encountered were well-mannered and very helpful."
,,Informative,5.0,,"Would say it is the best museum in Singapore that can cater to most people, especially if they don't have strong preferences in art or peranakan culture, etc.

Does change their exhibits once in a while, and brings in featured exhibitions. Some of these can be rather boring/tailored to particular audiences. Would be better to bring in more exhibitions that will bring in more interested locals."
,,I didn't notice when 5 hours were gone,5.0,,"Close to Bras Basah MRT station, located in the beautiful neighbourhood of some Management University, this museum is a collection of thematic galleries displaying artefacts and clear information. The audio guide is a must if you are interested to learn more. There is a nice restaurant with an open air area, and with tasty food, if you need a break from the plenty of intellectual food."
,,"Incredibly curated, moving exhibits",5.0,,This is a world class museum. It's artefacts were presented so well and the perspective of history was very diplomatic. Lots of interesting facts and some cool hands on stuff too. We spent three hours wandering around.
,,Good for kids,4.0,,"Visited on the morning with kids and elderly father. The set up is good, good wheelchair / pushchair access after entry with plenty to keep the kids engaged.

We didn't get round it all in a couple of hours and will be back to see the rest of it."
,,Love it,5.0,,I spent four hours instead of planned two hours. So interesting to see the history of Singapore. The ticket is $10 for tourist.
,,A Must Visited!,4.0,,"At the first sight, I've fallen in love with the architecture. Very incredible and so colonial. Inside the museum was about Singapore history since it was founded by Nila Utama, until the modern Singapore in 2015.

When I visited in 2 January 2016, there was an exhibition from British Museum. So I can see mummy and the other cultures from all around the world: Asia, America, Middle East, Oceania, ancient Greek and Rome, etc.

If you are a student, you can get discount up to 50% or even free entry."
,,Great Place to visit on a hot and/or rainy day,5.0,,The history of Singapore display is well worth the visit. Senior citizens (over 60's) are entitled to a reduced price admission subject to documentary proof of age (e.g. driving licence).
,,Definitely worth seeing,4.0,,"I found my trip to this museum very informative, not just because of what was in the museum itself but by standing in an entry line which took 60 minutes to get me in the door I learnt how patient Singaporeans can be - they were still issuing tickets written out by hand! Once in though The exhibits were great, especially on WW II and Lee Kwon Yoo."
,,"Exciting ""Top Secret"" exhibits",5.0,,"The new exhibits released from the archives are eye-opening. It shared so much of what the founding fathers held so dear, a vision of a flourishing Singapore. What really came through was their drive for this country, totally out of their passion to build a future for all Singaporeans. Truly heroes of Singapore!"
,,Last day,5.0,,"I had planned on visiting several museums this day but with 2 excellent exhibitions on, I found I spent over 5 hours here. Beautiful and it has a fairly decent cheap eatery as well as a restaurant."
,,Very good introduction to Singapore's History,5.0,,A beautiful museum. The permanent exhibit with an overview of Singapore's history is well curated. Well worth a visit.
,,Excellent exhibit from British Museum,4.0,,Arrived by taxi and were almost the first into this exhibit at 10am. By the time we left at 13:00 there were queues to enter. Beautiful building and an interesting exhibit. Ticket to special exhibit entitled you to 10% off non-exhibit items in shop.
,,Singapore's History in One Building,5.0,,"We spent more than two hours walking around inside the National Museum of Singapore and really impressed with the exhibitions that they have.

The museum allow visitors to learn about the history of Singapore from different aspects such as trades, the war and British colonisation, old tech tools and equipment, information about the Opium den in Singapore, old Ads campaigns and even a cool entertainment section of its own. We saw some of the funny paper ads including the tiger balm ads.

The entertainment section was a big archive of some movies that was made and released in Singapore (incl. those made by Shaw Brothers / SB) and they also had some of the movie props in the gallery!

We also checked out the fashion culture of Singapore where they displayed many beauty magazines as well as old clothing piece such as a dress with Campbell soup pattern.

I'd also recommend the museum if you're looking for a cool place to take a pre-wed photos in Singapore. The museum will charge a nominal amount of money to do so."
,,Great venue for a short visit,4.0,,"My daughter's school holidays gave us a good reason to visit some of the museums in Singapore.

The National Museum offered free entry to Singaporeans but as we wanted to see the 'Treasures of the World' exhibit, there was a minimal charge for it.

The Museum itself is very well organized, cool and quiet. It's a perfect oasis for a respite from the heat.

Displays of life in Singapore in the old days is beautifully done.

The Treasures of the World was a fairly small exhibit but had some interesting pieces from the different regions of the world.

In all, a nice way to spend a couple of hours."
,,Interesting history museum,5.0,,"Do you wanna know more about the history? Go to this museum. It is a nice building, not to expensive. Al the rooms have a different look. With screens, sounds, touchscreen monitors can you learn about Singapore from 14th century till today. Time path is well explaind on storyboards to. Also paintings and attributes, land maps. It was an interesting visit."
,,Informative and interactive,5.0,,"Visited on January 1st and found that entry was free. This museaum is a great place to get a handle on the history of Singapore and it's transformation to the city state it is now. The displays document Singapore from it's early history, through British involvement, Japanese occupation, independence and it's now thriving economy. Well worth a few hours of any visitor to Singapore's time."
,,Some bizarre modern exhibitions!,3.0,,"Good place to cool off during the day. Best to go on Friday nights when it is free. Seems like local artists are trying very hard to impress & make a social commentary. At times seems too forced. Very amateurish. Maybe, I am jaded as I have been to the truly great museums in NY, Boston, Chicago, Paris, Madrid, Vatican & Florence."
,,Worth spending the time,5.0,,I really liked how well kept everything was. Exhibits were very presented in an interesting and engaging manner. It was enjoyable learning about each of the pieces. Information provided was also very helpful. The building itself is amazingly beautiful. You can take photos inside but without the flash. I accidentally had my flash on and was gently and politely reminded by a sweet young lady who was on duty to switch it off. Having a student card will enable you to get a discount on the entrance fee.
,,Informative and fun,4.0,,It has multiple halls catering to different categories. One is dedicated to old movies and television which is fun.
,,Really interesting,4.0,,"This museum is housed in a lovely building and it is a pleasure just to walk around.
The exhibits on the ground floor about the early history of Singapore are particularly interesting and very well designed. The exhibit about Singapore under Japanese occupation is also fascinating and quite moving."
,,Great exhibition in a well presented building,5.0,,The exhibitions pay homage to the country's short history including the colonial period and WWII. The later periods include the recollections of current day citizens. The exhibits are housed in a beautifully renovated building of classic straits colonial architecture.
,,Worth a shot visit,3.0,,"Nothing special with relatively limited collection and representation of Singapore's history, I am sure they could have done better. Pay attention to the temporary exhibitions - they had the one from British museum when I visited in early December."
,,Beautiful exhibits,4.0,,"Gorgeous building and technically-impressive exhibits. Wide range of information covered and presented in different ways, from placards to interactive touch screens. I only wish there had been even more to see!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Worth a visit . Well laid out , good details , photography without flash is permitted. It's value for money"
,,GOOD FOR KILLING TIME,5.0,,Very well organized and informative. Very clean. Several blocks from the train. Easy to find. Different pricing for entrance. I paid $5.00 because I was only going to be there for a short time.
,,British saves the day,4.0,,"Excluding 'treasures of the world', the museum is not the most outstanding one. It is informative about Singapore's history, but the variety of gallery is slightly disappointing. The exhibits from British museum are fascinating and collections are nice. One drawback is that it makes the regular galleries look extremely ordinary."
,,I reccommend a free guided tour,4.0,,We luckily entered the museum just few minutes before a free guided tour started. The guide was a local volunteer who told us a lot about history of Singapore.
,,Treasures Of The World exhibit,5.0,,"A collaboration with the British Museum, this is an amazing collection of relics from all over the world. Definitely worth a visit!"
,,National Museum of Singapore,5.0,,"When you got out from Dhoby Ghaut MRT station exit A. The Museum is near YMCA building. The duration is about 5 minutes walk from the MRT station. It is a place to understand about Singapore history. There is a Exhibition in basement 1, which is about Treasures of the World from The British Museum. And you can understand more about the culture and history."
,,A well presented history of Singapore,5.0,,This museum is worth visiting if you want to learn about Singapore's diverse population and fascinating history. It also has a very nice gift shop.
,,Full of local history of Singapore,5.0,,A fascinating place to visit to learn more of Singapore. The kids will love the place too. We spent a few hours here.
,,Beautiful and informative,4.0,,"I'm not a Singapore museum fan. Not that I'm biased about local museum, but I felt our history is too short. I went because of the recent 'treasure of the world' exhibition where I visited. But when done and once I stepped into the Singapore history section, I was impressed with the design, lightings and layout. A lot of efforts, thoughts and planning has been put in to interest visitors. Very educational especially for kids. After a 2.5 hrs in Sgp section, it changed my perception of local museum being uninteresting."
,,A must see place in Singapore,5.0,,"I can say that it is the best place to visit in Singapore than Orchard Rd. and Universal Studio. This place tells the story of the nation from the stone to the late colonized period and also the story of the person who change to country, Mr.Lee. Every single second I spent in this museum is worth for the knowledge and the story of Singapore also. You had not to miss this place, if you were in Singapore."
,,THE place to understand Singapore's history,4.0,,"Not only is the National Museum the best place in Singapore to understand Singapore's history, but is in itself a great piece of architecture to marvel as well, especially after her restoration. Plenty of opportunities for photo ops abound and the gift shop sells many interesting and unique souvenirs and trinkets for locals and travellers alike."
,,Quaint museum,4.0,,"This museum is really important in understanding how Singapore was in its creation and path towards how it is today.
It really sheds a light on how only 30-50 years ago, women were denied education.
There were many exhibits about the culture and growth of Singapore.
Also there was a limited time exhibition from The British Museum, it was absolutely amazing!!!
This museum also has a pretty decent caf√®, best milkshake i have ever had!"
,,Lee Kwan Yew Memorial,5.0,,"When I visited the National Museum in April 2015, it was actually closed except for the memorial for Lee Kwan Yew, who had passed away a week before.

Fortunately, it was free admission and I found it to be very informative. Being an outsider, I knew little of Singapore's history. The exhibit did very well in detailing Singapore's first prime minister and how he is responsible for the way the country is today.

I hope to return in the future and actually see the rest of the museum!"
,,brilliant building,3.0,,"the building is at least half of the joy of this place, a classic building with a lovely seeming of new premises at the rear, the display is informative and well arranged, cafe, gift shop and a great rainy day activity"
,,Great history lesson,5.0,,"Great way to spend an afternoon learning about Singaporean history and culture. Multi floors, lots of exhibitions and fun things to see. There's a nifty restaurant on site and a great kids play area on the the 3rd floor!"
,,Not to be missed in Singapore,5.0,,"This new attraction is a must. It was so interesting, informative and so brilliantly presented that we would rate it as one of the top attractions in Singapore. Top cultural experience."
,,Overpriced and overrated,2.0,,"Paid an extortionate amount to see an exhibition of stuff I know well from the British Museum.

Sadly the other exhibits were more stuff I have seen on my world travels. Nothing exciting and nothing much about Singapore.

The only really good thing is the actual building itself."
,,Delightful Gem of a Museum -- in English,5.0,,"We stopped by this museum during a rain storm and were saddened to leave when we were finished. It tells the story of Singapore in an objective fashion, with the most attention given to Japanese atrocities during the occupation in World War II."
,,A must see during your trip.,5.0,,"Coming here is the perfect way to learn about the history and culture of Singapore. I can honestly say that I learned a lot as there is a lot of information. The museum isn't too large so an hour or two should be fine, and admission is cheap. It's a perfect starting point for a day of sightseeing."
,,Learn the hirstory of Singapore,5.0,,Volunteer guides will take you on a tour of this magnificent old building and highlight Singapore's history.
,,Delightful refurbed- needs several hours or more,5.0,,Excellent historical/ educational exhibits and information. Would not take children or teens unless they are patient and curious. There IS a children's interactive floor on floor 3. Very nice coffee/cafe. Souvenirs etc. Currently British Arrtifacts from Around the World on loan through March ?? 2016.
,,"Gorgeous building, informative displays",4.0,,"Recently restored, this building is the hero. Classic in front, modern building behind, Singapore does civic buildings better than most. Current exhibition, 'Treasures of the World' from the British Museum is worth the visit. A compact collection, but check out the bust of Hadrian!"
,,Fantastic place to explore.,5.0,,"National museum of Singapore is one of the best Museum in Singapore. Telling story about Singapore life from the beginning till now. For tourists, you can pay a minimum fee. But for Singaporeans and PRs. . Entrance fee is free. But some exhibition needs to pay. But it is worth to explore. Come and visit."
,,A highlight of our trip,5.0,,"So informative- we ran out of time. Some museums can be a little boring but not this one. To start, the building is beautiful, so much so that wedding photos are frequently taken here and there was a bride and groom doing that whilst we were here. The ground floor displays were excellent and provided such an insight into the lives of ordinary people following the invasion of the Japanese in WW2. This was partly done through the voices of a couple , now in their 90's and their experiences. They had even lent their wedding rings to the display. As already stated, the museum also provided information concerning the history of Singapore up to the present day. Loved it all. We did have a break in the ground floor cafe, between 3pm - 6pm they had an offer of coffee and cake for $8 which was great value and
excellent. (Outside that time, cake alone is $7). The staff in the cafe were very pleasant and helpful."
,,Treasures of the world from the British museum,5.0,,It was an eye opening experience with over 200 artefacts from all over the world. See my pictures for more.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,$10 admission fee included a guided 1 hour tour which was great. An interesting museum which I really enjoyed. Within walking distance to Raffles hotel for a Singapore Sling.
,,Wow!,5.0,,Beautiful and informative displays of how life started in Singapore all the way to modern times. Very interesting and exquisitely designed. Right downtown. The cafe on the bottom floor is kind of small and a bit expensive but very comfortable and good food. Nice break in between the two main exhibits. You can have lunch or just a drink. Museum is only SD$10 but half price for 60+. Great deal you can't miss!
,,All about SIngapore,3.0,,"The museum has several galleries dedicated to different aspects of the history of the city-state of Singapore. Women's lives and accomplishments are included, an unusual and appropriate approach. The large and modern interior is broken up into 5 or 6 large galleries. There is a fancy gourmet restaurant in the building and a separate little casual cafe. The food at the cafe was delicious."
,,Most Enlightening & Informative,4.0,,"On the last day (Saturday 7th November 2015) of our Singapore Holiday, my wife and I visited the National Museum. We arrived about an hour before our scheduled 1:00 p.m. guided tour and spent the time viewing the various galleries and exhibits in the older part of the museum. The Stamford Gallery on the ground floor had an exhibition entitled ‚ÄúWe Built a Nation‚Äù to commemorate Singapore‚Äôs 50th anniversary of independence. On the next level (Level 2) the galleries portrayed ‚ÄúLife in Singapore in the Past 100 Years‚Äù. The exhibits were devoted to various aspects of life in Singapore such as Growing Up in Days Gone By, Voices of Singapore reflecting the new Singapore identity, Surviving the Japanese Occupation, and the Modern Era. There was also a gallery devoted to William Farquhar‚Äôs Collection of Natural History Drawings.

We had finished viewing the Modern Era gallery, when we had to go downstairs to join our tour guide for the 1:00 p.m. guided tour. Our guide was a pleasant, friendly Chinese gentleman who was enthusiastic and very knowledgeable. Our group consisted of about a dozen people ‚Äì all tourists from different parts of the world. After giving us the background to the Museum building and its architecture, our guide took us to the Singapore History Gallery which was in a modern wing at the back of the museum. Our excellent guide gave us a most enlightening tour and an interesting narrative about the beginnings of the nation as a trading port in the 13th century, through to British colonisation in 1819, the Japanese Occupation from 1942 to 1945, post-war struggles, merger with Malaysia and finally independence in 1965 and present-day modernisation. The exhilarating and informative guided tour ended at a quarter past two, and we would have loved to spend a bit more time in the museum but had to dash back to our hotel to pack and leave for the airport to catch our flight back home to Australia."
,,Excellent place to learn about the history of Singapore,4.0,,Really good museum which tells the history of Singapore. It's a great way to learn a bit more about the country before getting on with exploring it. Fort Canning park is also a really nice place to visit at the same time.
,,Join the tour. Great knowledge,4.0,,"I got lost heading to the museum but got an opportunity to wander through fort canning.

The recommendation is to join a tour run by one of the volunteers. They are certainly very knowledgeable and will give you a brief run through in an hour. Then you have the remainder of the time to continue exploring the other exhibits , or if you're short on time move to the other museums close by that are connected by the free shuttle or walk!"
,,The latest revamp in Oct 2015 really didnt help Singapore's oldest Museum!,2.0,,"Its latest revamp was a downright disappointment to me as a Singaporean!

It is now more cramped and messy.
It stopped short of surprises when it gave me a decade ago when it re-opened......the mood in appreciating historical artefacts is not apparent due to the latest way of cramping all materials into limited space!
Sadly, it loses all its charm into exploring Singapore's past. (Understanding Singapore's past with no depth is the best it can do now)"
,,Useful background for Singapore visit,4.0,,This was the first visit we did on a short stopover in Singapore. It is within reasonable walking distance of Clarke Quay albeit uphill! It was a lovely air conditioned building that was part old and part new. It opened at 10.00 and only had a modest entrance fee. There was a good discount for seniors. The museum had lots of useful information about Singapore's history including the Second World War and it subsequent steps to independence. It gives a great perspective for the rest of your visit.
,,Great way to learn the history of Singapore,4.0,,Interesting museum that is a great way to learn about the history of Singapore. It is also good to get some relief from the heat for a couple of hours
,,Very interesting,4.0,,A very interesting museum laid out in a very informative way. The actual building in which the museum is housed is full of character too. Well worth a visit.
,,Part of our guided tour,4.0,,"The national Museum provided an interesting and informative insight into the ethnicity and history of this young nation, well worth a visit"
,,A pleasant few hours,4.0,,"If you're a history buff, it's certainly worth making a stop here to see the interesting exhibits. I enjoyed the Singapore history hall the most & the museum has done a great job in bringing some of the facts to life. I was less interested in some of the bespoke exhibits but there's enough here to keep you interested & without having to spend hours trawling lots of rooms."
,,Great for a really hot or rainy day,4.0,,We loved it here. Learning about Singapore's role in World War II was very interesting (and the air conditioning was also a plus). We had lunch at the cafe and it was fairly reasonably priced. If you have a couple of hours I would definitely recommend heading to the museum
,,Modern beautiful Museum,5.0,,I attended on an open day and was surprised it was free- normally $10 for adults. Perfect place to escape the heat for a few hours. Could spend longer there. Really interesting to see Singapore's history and journey into independence through to life through the decades to present day.
,,Presents the history of Singapore,3.0,,It is helpful in understanding the history of Singapore. There are many scenes of events mocked up with a number of artifact and pictorial displays. There were not all that many actual artifacts.
,,One of the best presenter museums I know!,5.0,,"Close to the city centre and easily reached by MRT you find this wonderful museum. We never visit Singapore without going there. In a partly old, partly modernized, building the museums presents Singapore history as well as the present. The exhibits are extremely well presented, not overwhelmed with text, and balances teaching and general information wonderfully."
,,A Must See!,5.0,,Did not know the history of Singapore and this facility did a perfect job or organizing as much (or as little) information as you wished to experience. A lot of thought and heart went into the display of the great leadership and vision to allow Singapore to be what it is today with such a humble start in mid 1960's.
,,Impressive,5.0,,"Visted the Singapore History Gallery and the Life in Singapore Galleries,occupying level 1 & 2 of this musuem.

The exhibits at the Singapore History Gallery is well organised. Visitors get to learn about the history of Spore in a story telling manner as the exhibits are organised in a chronological timeline sequence. The exhibits are well curated.

The section I like the most is that of the Japanese occupation. Standing and looking at the exact table which the British signed the surrender agreement vis a vis the black and white video playing in the background of that historical event, one cannot help but feel goosebumps.

This museum does such a great job that you would feel teleported in a time machine to the history of Spore.

Aim to spend half a day here. Great for bringing your kids to learn about spore's history and for any foreigners who would like a quick snapshot of what Spore went through before becoming what she is today.

There are toilets in the museum. Air con can be a bit cold, hence you may want to bring a thin cardigan."
,,A great in-sight into the history of Singapore,4.0,,A very well laid out tour tour allowing you to appreciate the changes the country has been through and how diverse and proud the citizens are of this nation.
,,A must during the tour of Singapore,5.0,,A separate bay for Nattukottai Chettairs contribution to the development of Singapore. The history especially the happenings during the second world war and Japanese occupation is really good.
,,Not Bad,4.0,,"Showcases the history of Singapore with picture, artifact and diorama displays, within a refurbished historic building. Can be done in 1-2 hrs."
,,A great place to learn of Singapore's past,5.0,,"Some galleries are free, but the special exhibits are inexpensive to visit. There was a 50th anniversary exhibition on when we were there."
,,Don't Miss this Museum,5.0,,Beautiful exhibits without overwhelming the visitor with information. It provides a good overview of the history of Singapore. Anyone visiting for the first time should add it to their list of stops.
,,Great intro to Singapore,5.0,,I visited the first day of my stay in Singapore and it gave me a great understanding of the place's history. Nice exhibition. Great as a first stop on your trip.
,,Excellent Museum,5.0,,Great story of Singapore with quite a lot of interactive experiences. Enjoyed my three hours there. Of course a lot of coverage from the Japanese occupation.
,,I like this museum,5.0,,I went to the museum with my children. The entrance fee is free for singaporean and charges only 5 S$ for children and senior adults and 10 S$ for adults. The exibition are fantastic from prehistoric singapore to modern singapore. There are lots of artefacts from various time. There are also many documents and mementos. The museum itself is very large. There are three storeys and in the upper part there is children activity rooms to keep the children happy for a while. There is also souvenir shop that sell uniques souvenirs such as books.
,,Special Exhibit of Lee Kuan Yew,4.0,,The special exhibit of the late Lee Kuan Yew was a nice extra but the permanent exhibit about the island was worth the entry price on its own.
,,Great way to understand Singapore,4.0,,Great building and excellent exhibit design. Start your trip to Singapore here as background to everything else you see. Difficult to believe so much done since birth of country in 1965. This is how they did it.
,,Not bad for a Small Country,3.0,,The museum is very nicely done. The history told is extensive and interesting for a small country. However artifacts are not great. Hope they will have more to display. For SGD10 is worth it.
,,The nation's history is well presented here,5.0,,The National Museum's many exhibits provide insight to the social and political evolution of Singapore from its earliest days to the present.
,,Huge building blending old and new,5.0,,"Air conditioned building and had been newly renovated.Learnt so much from the volunteer guide.She made it so interesting and answered our questions.Well worth taking a tour and if needs be going round again after.Had a super iced tea in the cafe and big piece of carrot cake ,v reasonable price.But did have to wait for a table so came back at intervals to check availability.Would visit again."
,,Hands down one of the best museums I have ever visited,5.0,,"I ended up spending close to 3 hours wandering the exhibits, which are wonderfully creative. From dioramas to sounds clips, to artifacts, illustrations, movie clips, smells (frangipani and the old river)... use of technology is an example to all. I especially enjoyed the comparative screens showing Singapore in the 60s and 70s! Absolutely worth a visit - or several!"
,,impressive building and some historical context but did not WOW me,3.0,,"We went to the National Museum of Singapore expecting it to ooze maritime history and migration stories and so on and there was some of that but it was somehow not presented in as accessible way as I had expected. The building is impressive and by the time we left we knew more than when we arrived but it was not, I regret to say, a tourist highpoint of our stay in Singapore."
,,Interesting look at History of SQ,4.0,,"Well organised tour as well as layout of the Museum, with many EXPAT volunteer guides on hand. Entry is free, opens at 10:00am to 19:00pm. Opposite the Museum you will find the Fullerton Hotel with a foot bridge dating back many years, well maintained. Today there is a lovely riverside walk. lined with Art bronze sculptures."
,,"Singapore 50 , or should it be Singapore 196 ?",5.0,,"We visited this only a few weeks after it had re-opened after a refurb to celebrate Singapore 50 I.e. 50 years since independence. However, as the exhibits explained, it is nearly 200 years since the founding of modern Singapore by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819. The building is very well preserved having been first opened in Queen Victoria's reign and has a multi storey modern addition to the rear.
The exhibits are extremely well presented and give an excellent explanation of the development of Singapore over the past 200 years (and before)
Definitely a place to visit for an hour or so."
,,amazing!,5.0,,"Going there was a kind of last minute plan.
It is not difficult to reach with the public transport but you have to choose the right exit from the station.
(I made the wrong choice so still now I can' t say what the best option is. Just ask to the station staff.

The museum is very interactive and everything is build up to give the impression to re-live the atmosphere of the ancient Singapura.

Very very very interesting!
And cheap, only 10 dollars!"
,,Great Docent Tour,4.0,,"Get to the museum before 2 for an English speaking tour. We were lucky and had a great, informative tour guide. We did this on our 2nd day in Singapore and would recommend to do it before going all over the city. The historical background helps a lot in viewing
other sights. The tour lasted over an hour and only took you through the bottom floor of the Museum. The 2 Level was not as interesting without the docent...adequate information, but not done as well as Level 1 History Exhibit,"
,,"Beautiful Building, Elegant Restaurant, Free Exhibit: We Built A Nation",5.0,,"I went in to see the building interior and architecture and went thru their first free exhibit We Built A Nation, which I thought was excellent. It answered a lot of questions - like how a nation of so many different peoples, with different traditions, cultures and religions get along so well together - you can see part of their constitution and learn how Singapore became independent of the British, Japanese and Malaysia. It's a small exhibit and feels very personal. Worth it to take the time to go thru. There's a beautiful elegant old world looking restaurant in there as well. (not fast food - not kid oriented looking). I didn't go thru the rest of the museum - I'd gotten what I wanted."
,,a trip to the past,4.0,,a well explained history of singapore. for you who loves historical site this place is a must visit when you're in singapore.
,,It really gives an insight into Singapore,4.0,,"A visit to this museum, helps you to understand not only the history of Singapore, but also the present. Perhaps where it falls down is in not giving enough information about the time before the British era. Nice exhibits, well worth a visit."
,,Start your Singapore visit here,5.0,,Great place to start your Singapore sojourn. Multi media presentation of the country's history. The knowledge you acquire helps put your visit in context.
,,New permanent galleries are now open,4.0,,"We have been here a few times before, but today was the first chance to see the recently re-opened permanent galleries and the focus on Singapore's history. There are some well thought out exhibits and plenty of interesting information on Singapore's evolution with quite a bit of interesting material from the period of Japanese occupation (1942-1945). Entry is free for citizens and PRs but $10 otherwise for adults. It's also a good way to escape the haze."
,,I felt I learned a lot of the history and founding Singapore,5.0,,"This was a very educational experience about the early founding of Singapore as a major port, which colonial powers ran and abused the local population. The unvarnished history of both British and Japanese occupation during the 19th & 20th century and finally the road to independence. I especially liked listening to the speech of the first prime minister Lee when he came to power. a real visionary and determined individual."
,,Excellent history of Singapore,5.0,,I've visited the National Museum twice now and have really enjoyed the immersive experience both times. Loved the audio recreations of each exhibit and the story it told about Singapore. The second time was with my daughter (then 8) and she didn't quite have the patience to journey through the entire museum. I spent around three hours here by myself. Loved it.
,,Go here to know more about Singapore past,4.0,,I visited this place during my recent visit on Saturday's. There was no entrance fees at that time due to Singapore's 50th Independence Day celebrations. But to access 700 Years of Singapore History (a special exhibition) I paid $6. Overall the place is worth watching.
,,a brief history,4.0,,"This impressive colonial building has been extended with a lovely glass atrium joining the two parts. The new building houses the key exhibition on the ground floor. This is a history in images, objects and reconstructions and was very well done and interesting. There are four smaller galleries on the second floor depicting life in the colonial era and during the occupation by the Japanese. We then had a very nice lunch in the Good For Thought cafe and there are some nice gifts in the shop.
We found Dhobi Ghaut station very confusing- exit A is closest to the Museum."
,,"Was here for ""Singapura 700 Years""",4.0,,"The museum was under renovation when I was here last December, but there was downstairs (on a basement level or something) the show called ""Singapura 700 Years"" which was a fairly good show (though it may have been a bit hastily prepared) displayed in five or six rooms starting from the ancient time when Malay kings ruled the island long before the British arrived through the British colonial period and the subsequent Japanese occupation period during WW2 to the post-war ""Road to Merdeka"" (transition to Independence) period, each distinct historical period in its own room. One thing noteworthy I saw in the show is the bell donated by the daughter of American Revolutionary War hero Paul Revere to the British colonial government of Singapore in the early 1800's, and with no damage or crack whatsoever it looked like just what it must have looked like almost 200 years ago when it first arrived on the island! Also liked the glass display cases with miniature figures inside depicting scenes from the colonial period, the WW2 occupation period and the independence movement period (kind of a voting scene).

The back part of the building seemed like an extension to the original building with the original back fa√ßade beautifully maintained, and it's really pretty spacious back there with a caf√© on the ground level and a children's playroom or something on the highest level up the escalators. And, going out of the museum through a side door at that back part (the door near the caf√©) will take you to the outdoor escalator leading to Fort Canning Park right behind the museum. Also, one more thing of interest outside the building is a bench on the left side (as facing the front of the museum) of the front grounds with five colorful sculptures on it which, I think, represent the figures of the five ancient Malay rulers of Singapore (their figures were actually also in the Singapura show mentioned above).

One way to get here by public transportation is taking the MRT to Bras Basah station (yellow line); once you're on Bras Basah Rd. after coming out of the station, turn right and walk along Bras Basah until you hit Bencoolen where you turn left, then just go straight on Bencoolen with the museum at the end of the street; it will only be about a ten-minute walk from when you get on Bras Basah Rd. after coming out of the MRT to when you get to the front door of the museum."
,,Very Educational,5.0,,This museum is a great place to learn about the politics and social history of Singapore.If these topics interest you or you have a thirst for knowledge this is a great place to learn. You could spend hours here. The displays are in a variety of formats .
,,Perfect place to get a feel of Singapore's history,4.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore is a perfect place to get a feel of Singapore's history. The ground floor shows the development of Singapore from its earliest days through the British times, then its occupation by Japan, and later its independent status to the modern city it is now. The first floor depicts life in Singapore over the years, and gives us a very vivid view of the life style of the people including the types of costumes worn, education, entertainment and the like. A visit here is very informative and definitely worth the time spent. They also have interesting exhibitions and festivals throughout the year."
,,Nice information about SG history,3.0,,"Good place to spend time for example during rain hours. Gives nice and good view to history of Singapore from different times. Perhaps a bit plain compared to other similar museums in other countries, however visit is worth to add a bit depth into normal holiday trip in Singapore."
,,A great place full of info for a full day,5.0,,So much info and history and a free tour guide only cost $10 to get in and had over 5 hours inside so much to read and see was very interesting place to visited
,,Interesting,4.0,,It's inside a beautiful looking building and has plenty of interesting things to view. The museum is a great place to go in the middle of the day to get out of the heat.
,,Half exhibits closed,2.0,,"Closed exhibits possibly bad timing, what was there was pretty good. Very small museum realistically."
,,First thing to do if you want to understand local culture,4.0,,"This is a place that can help you really understand the making of Singapore, through a well organized exhibition on the ground floor; it will take you around two hours to go through it and read and listen to the story, but it will offer also a good background for visiting after that the center for Contemporary Arts or the Art Museum; it is hosted into a nice building, with good facilities including a good restaurant, Food for Thought. If you spend some time in the city, this can really be a good place to start."
,,Mostly contemporary art,5.0,,"i was a bit surprised cos I expected lots of older art, but ok Singapore is not that old. Lots of very good and different art. From the silicon bodies of some of the worlds worst dictators to a nudity exhibition , going from one surprise to another"
,,National Museum,5.0,,Beautiful building and we enjoyed a fascinating exhibition showing the history of Singapore with many interesting exhibits.
,,Brand New Experience,4.0,,This is the first time we have visited this museum since our younger days. It has been completely and thoughtfully revamped. For Singaporeans the entrance is free for the general exhibits but you still need to pay for the special exhibits. We like the display of the archaeological finds of early life in Singapore. Worth a visit.
,,Excellent museum,4.0,,This museum has recently been re-opened after renovation. There is an excellent overview of the history of Singapore. I was particularly impressed with the sensitive handling of the Japanese occupation during WWII. They could have dwelt on the atrocities but instead focused on how people coped during that period. There is also a very nice cafe in the atrium for a light lunch or snack to rest weary feet before moving on.
,,"Impressive Museum,",5.0,,"I came here for a quick visit and was really impressed with the breadth of the information here. If you want an overview of the history of Singapore this is the place to be. I learnt lots. The museum is modern and attractive, with a number of galleries, with the main gallery covering the history of Singapore. I really enjoyed reading the panels and interacting with the media.

My only regret was that I couldn't spend more time here. There are about 6 galleries and I only got through 3 very quickly.

Admission is about S$10 and to get your moneys worth you should spend at least half a day there - there's a lot to take it.

There is an older part of the museum but a new wing was built which took two years to complete - the joining of the 2 buildings is very tastefully done.

The location is really close to Raffles and is in walking distance from there. Also nearby is Fort Canning park. If you want o save your legs and almost killing yourself walking up there from the museum like i did nearly expiring from heat exhaustion, take the escalator which is situated next to the museum."
,,Recommended...it's nice,4.0,,Recommended even for those who don't like museum. It is not boring. Atmosphere indoor is very comfortable too. I think it is worth it even if you have to pay for your tickets.
,,Great musuem,4.0,,"This is the place to go to explore and understand the history of Singapore, we loved it extremely well done and our volunteer guide was wonderful"
,,Recommend for Museum Haters,4.0,,"Visiting museum sometimes identic with word ""boring"", but here you can experience the unique performa of a museum, evan some (a little) things that been showed there seems ridiculous but it give description of how Singapore can be like Singapore today. And you will find yourself enjoying the place called museum.

Thanks to their late prime minister..."
,,A great place for family Outing (Educational and Fun),4.0,,"The National Museum just completed the renovation and just reopen to public a month ago, an awesome place to visit as it let the visitors to have better understanding of Singapore history. We need to admit that the renovated National Museum have more interaction with the visitors as compared to the old Museum. Not only you able to see it, touch it, some of them, you even able to smell it, to let you have a real feel of the timeframe of the history. You may wish to request for a guided tour if you have difficult understanding these exhibits, which we personally feel this is really great services as the tour guide are very knowledgeable and jovial! FYI, all the Exhibition hall are air-condition, as such you able to enjoy these exhibits in a cool condition, great place to beat the hot afternoon sun and haze too. The Museum Building itself is well architected that good place for photo taking too. An exhibition worth mentioned is the one that showcase of our great leader- Mr Lee Kuan Yew, exhibited his living room, his study room and some of his items like the famous 'Red Box"". Another new attraction is a new ""Play Corner"" for the Children at level 3, which my children love it.

It totally free admission for the local or permanent resident (all you need is to produce Singapore IC or student pass to proof your nationality ) and $10 charge for foreigner and $5 for Foregin senior citizen or student.

There is a cozy cafe at level 1 that sell some good coffee and snack, there is another restaurant called Flutes which I heard it is one of the top 100 restaurant in Asia in 2013, however we did not dine in as we just have our lunch before visiting the Museum.

We recommend to take the public transport - MRT to the nearest train station Ghoby Ghaut MRT, exit A then walk about 7-10 min. There also free Museum Shuttle services at Dhoby Ghuat MRT, City Hall MRT or Bras Basah MRT which about 5 min bus journey.

We spent about 3 hours to complete all the exhibitions hence we found it really a great place for family outing as it Educational p and fun tour for our family. Please give me a Helpful vote if my feedback will able to help you."
,,Fantastic museum,5.0,,"I cannot recommend this museum highly enough.

The beautiful building is worth the trip in itself.

The displays were interactive and very interesting- describing the development and evolution of Singapore to the place we see today.

We arrived here in the morning and would have spent at least three hours looking at the displays. Make time for this museum in your trip."
,,Young nation with a lot of history,4.0,,"Singapore may only be celebrating its 50th birthday this year, but their history goes back many centuries and you'll learn about it all in this interesting museum. I spent about 3 hours and discovered much I didn't know about the pre-British years, the Japanese occupation, and the inspirational leadership of Lee Kuan Yew. One mild criticism: I wish some exhibits could involve the viewer more creatively."
,,A Particularly Well Designed Museum Experience,5.0,,The building itself is a gem and the displays are all well done. The are several eating areas in the museum and the restaurant with the white table cloths (I have forgotten the name) was excellent.
,,good,5.0,,"good place to visit. Probably on of the highlights of Singapore. The exhibits were not to my taste, but that depends on the collection"
,,Must come!,4.0,,A must come to know the history of Sgp... As a local there is so much to see and learn too! Enjoyed the Singapore History Gallery
,,Must do!,5.0,,"We went on our last day in Singapore. Must do! Great exhibits about the history of Singapore. Very informative, stayed for about 2 hours but could stay longer. The food at Food for Thought was brilliant! Tasty and cheap-ish (they don't charge you GST). Great service too. Admission is $10 for an adult, which is fairly affordable. Must do!"
,,Terribly rude staff,2.0,,Museum might be fine but the service was terrible. We were ignored at the ticket desk and were eventually told the museum would be closing in 30 minutes. Very rude staff.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Can't recommend this place highly enough. Simply wonderful. Great visual and audio presentation. After visiting this museum you can see why Singaporeans are do proud of their country.
,,Terrific!,5.0,,"I highly recommend everyone, yes EVERYONE check out this museum. It has lovely architecture - lots of natural light, huge windows, massive columns and stairways.

When I visited, there were two temporary exhibits - a special SG50 exhibition for Singapore's 50th year, and a commemorative one for Founding Father Lee Kuan Yew. Highly interactive displays and very clear, informative signs.

The fixed exhibits were also very interesting. It was nice to experience the history of Singapore and see lots of childhood memorabilia.

Entry is free for the most part, but foreign tourists may have to pay a modest sum.

There are two restaurants - Flutes, and Food for Thought.

Easily accessible by public transport - they even have a free shuttle bus that loops three different museums - National Museum, Singapore Art Museum, and Singapore Pinacotheque de Paris."
,,History and Perspectives,4.0,,The museum is well set out. Interesting to see the history from a Singapore point of view rather than just from a British colony view. Exhibits are set out well
,,My Big 50 as well,5.0,,"I am an Ex-Singaporean on vacation from Adelaide in South Australia. I was last at this fine Museum in 1965. The museum had been refurbished for Singapore's 50th celebration. It was nothing like what it had been in the past. A definite winner as far as I am concerned. You can get a bite at the Food for Thought cafe situated on the museum grounds and with free Wifi it was very refreshing indeed.
Their fabulous public transport the SMRT is the ideal mode of getting there. Everybody speaks and comprehend excellent English and getting lost is not an option. Entry is free but a modest sum for exhibitions."
,,Excellent museum,4.0,,I really enjoy the visit. The building architecture is very nice. The exhibition for celebrated 50 SG was very good. I loved!
,,Worth the Visit!,4.0,,I would suggest everyone should take part of their day to check out this museum! It is worth the visit and definitely great to see the history of Singapore! (Went Summer 2012).
,,So glad we decided to visit,5.0,,"Very informative and educational, I already knew quite a bit about Singaporean history before visiting, but I was still very interested and enjoyed the exhibits."
,,Great place to bring little kids to hang here!,5.0,,"It's so beautiful here. Very relaxing. Nice air con(it's Singapore! You'll really appreciate it when you are here). Had been there on a weekday(during school holiday), our kid was the only kid on lvl 3 the kids' play room, so it's like a huge private function just for us! On the weekend, quite busy.

We love the gift shop there, $23 for a mighty wallet - mighty thin, strong and eco friendly, great gift for men. $13 for a unique bracelet, great for female friends."
,,Interesting Museum,4.0,,Interesting museum exhibit of history of Siingapore as the main gallery's where being refurbished for Singapore 50 when we visited. Nice play area for young kids on top floor.
,,Small and compact,3.0,,Nice museum and building but is very small and compact. Could do this in 45 minutes to an hour giving you plenty of time.
,,National Museum,4.0,,Museum is very much a centerpiece of the Night Festival. They open it up with a bunch of nice exhibits for free. Exciting to be able to check out the museum.
,,"Well-curated National Museum, formerly known as Raffles Museum.",4.0,,"This museum is worth visiting when you are in Singapore if you have 2 hours to spare and want to learn about Singapore's colourful, but short, history. Not really of much interest for young children."
,,Great way to spend a rainy afternoon!,4.0,,"Despite the fact that most of the museum was closed, we were able to spend time in the lower level and experience the interesting history of Singapore. I am not a history buff, but I learned a lot about this country and its amazing people! It was well worth the time spent there."
,,The Museum's galleries are closed till 19th Sep 2015,1.0,,"It's fair to say that the museum was 'closed' when we visited: the main exhibitions are still closed till 19th Septmber 2015.

I visited the museum a few years before, and decided to 'risk it' this time though I heard from a friend that the 'galleries' were closed. However I didn't expect it meant almost the whole museum was closed.

It was disappointing to find very minimal display at the museum, and that the museum was almost 'closed'.

The only open area to the public was a small section of the first floor, where Made in Singapore product exhibition was celebrated, and items made in Singapore (and Malaya) were on display. Text accompanied the exhibits so we got to appreciate the history of the items, and their links to the Singapore's history. Some of items might evoke your nostalgia.

The Made in Singapore display was like a mini warehouse. That was all we saw at the museum."
,,Beautiful Building,4.0,,Stunning building in the heart of SP. Carefully restored with fancy restaurant too. Not sure what there was to see & not sure it would justify the entrance fee. Brilliant place to hold events/exhibitions.
,,Beautiful solid Building with amazing history,4.0,,"This is worth a visit especially if there is night festival on during the weekends. The building is visually attractive both exterior and interior. I was fortunate to visit the museum during the night festival and in the day to browse through the history of Singapore.
No entrance fee to enter building to view but special exhibitions will have an entry fee. It was a free event for the night festival."
,,Enter via the Back Entrance (valet parking area) to Beat the Q during the Night Festival,4.0,,"You can't miss the Anooki animation projection on the museum's facade (7 min between shows)! It is really funny and kids would love the cute characters jumping about on the wall! The Nighfest runs on the last 2 Fri and Sat of Aug so you can still head on over this weekend! http://nightfest.sg/.
The crowds surged towards the museum entrance after the Anooki show so we walked towards Fort Canning (take the escalator near the illuminated 2 giant wire birds in the tree) and entered the museum via the back entrance (glass facade).
I think the kids would enjoy the tennis ball swings art installation :) You can find out surprising things and brands that are made in SG too!"
,,Amazing history,5.0,,"We were lucky to have plenty of free time and spent 5 hours in the museum and still want to revisit. We did not see everything fully but gave it our best shot. Exhibits were wonderful especially the section on the history of women in Singapore. We used the headsets which were easy to follow. There was an art exhibition and beautiful photographs. The gift shop had items not seen by us anywhere else. We stayed for coffee and cake which was delightful.
Note: if you are a 'senior' they will give you discounted entry if you ask!"
,,this musium is closed,1.0,,Very disappointed that there is no warning that the musium is closed for major renovations till a date in September. We turned up to find there was nothing to see despite being told that there was a 'Made in Singapore' display which amounted to nothing much. A long trip for nothing surely the official web site could warn vistors that they are closed
,,Great Museum for SG's 50th anniversary,5.0,,"Being in Singapore right before its 50th anniversary, i found the National Museum especially useful to understand its history - from Raffles' 1819 founding, and then its 50 years of independence."
,,The museum is closed,1.0,,We turned up to look at singapore's best museum yesterday. In one lobby there was some boxes displaying local products but everything else was closed. It appears the museum is closed for renovation. It baffles me first why this would be done during peak holiday season and secondly why all galleries need to be done at the same time.
,,Interesting and Enriching Visiting trip!,4.0,,"During the National Day Golden Jubilee long weekend, we decided to come by here for a visit to learn more about the history of this young nation. It has been ""x"" donkey years since our visit (at least 25 years).

As part of the SG50 celebrations, entry to the museum was free and so it attracted a big crowd turnout, not only tourists but also the locals. However, there were staff on duty and helped to divert the human traffic, so everything was orderly and fine.

And wow, the museum looked so much different from the past, it was nicer and more beautifully painted and decorated. Inside this similar Gothic style building, it looked brighter and more spacious.

And there it was, an exhibition of Singapore, introducing about its history since 13th century to the modern day of Singapore, spanning through about 700 years. There was also a section with displays of the things and equipment of the past (used in the earlier days of the nation), such as the TV set, Aircon, Gas stoves, familiar biscuit tins and other items. It was so nostalgic and brought back fond memories for us.

There was also an area allocated for children to do art and craft, drawing and visitors then could collect stickers, collar pins bearing the SG50 logo, post cards etc. These items were distributed free though visitors could make a donation to a box on the table.

A dinning area was there as well, cafeteria style serving finger food and local delights and also a place to stop for a rest and lay down for a cup of coffee after walking around the museum.

Near the entrance/exit is actually a gift shop, where visitors could grab some local-flavour souvenirs, ranging from keychains, postcards, t-shirts, artefacts, magnets to books etc (including memoirs of our founding father, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew).

Overall, our visit was pleasant and nice as we enjoyed so much in refreshing our knowledge about the nation building history, heritage and culture and did provide a good insight for us in some areas which we were not even aware or learn before. It was indeed more meaningful to visit this museum on National Day, and was heart-warming as we appreciated the pioneer generations for their hardwork and contribution in making this young nation to be 1st world and so successful!

The museum is located in the arts and culture district in the city center and from here, one can also visit other museums nearby as they are all located within 5-10 minutes of walk from here, such as the Peranakan Museum (Armenian Street), Singapore Philatelic Museum (Coleman Street), Civil Defence Heritage Gallery (Hill Street), among other museums and art galleries."
,,An enriching experience worth the visit..,4.0,,"This is the oldest museum in Singapore. Overall, it is a nice, historic & beautiful museum.

For those keen to understand the history of Singapore, this is certainly the best place to go to. There are also festivals & special international exhibitions held throughout the year.

Admission to the museum building is free but fees are chargeable for special exhibitions.

Food is an added bonus, with few F&B outlets set in nice decor.

The museum is located directly opposite to the Singapore Management University(SMU) & just across Orchard Road. Its a few minutes walk to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station.

Even if you are not a history enthusiast, its always enriching to learn something about another country's history when travelling.

We make it a point to do that wherever we travel to. Its worth it."
,,Long overdue visit to this grand old dame,4.0,,"I'm sure I visited the National Museum as a child but I literally had to no memory of it. With the SG50 celebrations and the long weekend, it was timely to visit with the children in tow.

We had a really great time. It was generally well-laid out with lots of space to look to each exhibit carefully. We also discovered that we actually learned a lot at school during Social Studies and History! :)

My daughter had a good time taking lots of photographs (flash off, of course). Some of the regular galleries were closed for revamp, which will give us a great reason to revisit later in the year.

Families with young children should head all the way to the top floor so that the children can have some time for independent free play.

Gift shops at museums always feature really unique and quirky items. As a Singaporean, it was really hard not to buy up the really cute Singaporean items. There was one whole section on 50% discount! I ended up with a watch that featured a spider for a second hand. The 'brand' of the watch was ""kan cheong""...get it? (Kan Cheong Spider!...LOL...the Singaporeans will get the joke!)"
,,Good food!,2.0,,"Visited this during the 50 th Singapore celebrations and it was very busy.the exhibitions were quite informative but quite small.there were several activities for children ,hat making and wood printing and an activity area ,but we were disappointed that there was so little to learn about the history of Singapore.
That said we had a delicious lunch in their restaurant !"
,,A Fascinating Glimpse,5.0,,"We enjoyed a fascinating walk through 700 years of Singapore's history leading to the celebration of 50 years of nationhood on the weekend we were there. The history may be confronting to some nationalities, but shows the struggles for identity and the culmination in the multicultural Singapore of today."
,,For those who want to understand Singapore's history,4.0,,"The museum is currently composed of a free and a paid sections. The free part exhibits products manufactured in Singapore in the 60s only. The paid section brings you from the stone-age era of Singapore to the modern one while there are special partitions about British colonisation, Japanese invasion and post-colonial Singapore. By walking through the boards and pictures, you will have a full understanding of how Singapore transforms from a rudimentary trading port to a world-class city state.

If you are familiar with post-colonial Southeast Asian history, you may find that they mention nothing about how the Singaporean authorities rivalled against the communists in the 50s and 60s. I know it is a bit sensitive to mention but....anyway, it's very worth visiting and I definitely recommend including museum into your itinerary."
,,FOR HISTORY JUNKIES,4.0,,"The outside profile awed me, the inside amused me!

If you want to learn the history of Singapore, you must pay this museum a visit. I enjoyed all to well the areas of this museum, too bad the others were on renovation while we were there.

For history lovers like me, this is a must. But it's so-so for normal people. My parents didn't enjoy it that much.

So overall, just good."
,,Some of it under renovation,4.0,,we always try to visit when we are here. This time like some of the other museums bits were closed. Not due to be reopened until September. We paid for the gallery that was opened about the history of Singapore.another One was also open and was free. Lots of school groups when we visited in the morning. If you want to avoid this maybe going later would work. Look forward to visiting next time when it is all open.
,,2 out of 3 galleries closed ........in July!,2.0,,"I'm not making it up! Both the History gallery and The Living Galleries were closed on the day of our visit. A museum disconnected from the notion that 'visitor experience' is important?
The exhibition we did see was a rather 'state biased' account of Malaysia's history which was clumsily censored and ended in the 1980s."
,,worth visiting if you want to know about singapore,4.0,,"my wife and i spent a few days in singapore and wanted to learn more about its history. A trip to the national museum was an excellent choice. Singapores history with the British, Chinees and Malasians was fascinating and its history from the 14C to today. well worth a couple of hours if you have time"
,,"Nice exterior, but not a whole lot inside",3.0,,"Visited while in Singapore on business. The exhibits that were available were nice, but many areas were closed, which was a bit disappointing. I will probably give it another visit in the future to see if other halls are opened up for viewing."
,,Beautiful exterior,3.0,,"Singapore's pubic buildings all seem to have been given a new coat of paint for the island's 50th birthday celebrations. This is a fine old colonial building well worth viewing from the outside.

The collections are OK, but rather small in extent. It does take long to get around the whole thing."
,,Terrific presentation of Singapore's history,4.0,,"This was my second visit to the National Museum of Singapore. Unfortunately, this time most of the museum was closed for renovation (loved seeing it all when it was open last time). However, even with the museum mostly closed, there is a special exhibit open which chronicles the history of Singapore from settlement through colonization through independence. Nice use of multimedia, and the level of detail is just right to give a visitor a nice sense of things without going into too much detail. Well worth a visit."
,,Place to know about entrepreneurs and products made in SG,3.0,,The place can reached by boarding 147 bus from china town towards Stamford road. The place can also reached by mrt and get down a bras basah. It show cases the early products ..businessmen.. Starting of Singapore industries and others things. The museam building is a huge structure of architecture. The is a fee of 6$ for tourist and some concession for locals aswell.
,,A great introduction to Singapore.,4.0,,Singapore has some of the best museums i've ever experienced and this one goes close to the top. We went to this one first and it was a great introduction to the country. The history is so interesting and you really feel like to know the country so much better. It also seems to be honest about the good and bad of the country's history.
,,Unexpectedly good,4.0,,I don't normally go to museums but this provided a really detailed and interesting history of Singapore. There's 3 exhibitions but only 1 was open when I visited - this was still worth the $6 though. There's plenty of activities to keep kids engaged as well.
,,"Only one exhibition, but done very well.",4.0,,"They only have one exhibition currently, as they are refurbishing most of the museum to be finished by September. However, the exhibition they did have was very well done. It followed the history of Singapore through the last 700 years, with emphasis on it being ""found"", trade, Japanese occupation and then post independence politics. It took me about an hour and a half to walk through, reading all the boards and watching the short films, but it could probably be done in an hour if you rushed. Worth a visit to get an understanding of Singapore's history."
,,Beautiful building and superb exhibits,5.0,,"We have visited the National Museum of Singapore twice, once in 2010 and most recently in July 2015.

The grounds and the building are magnificent and beautifully kept. The staff and pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and approachable. The exhibits are excellent and tell the story of Singapore's development beautifully.

Although most the museum exhibits are undergoing renovation at the moment the current display (a condensed version of the history of the island) is well worth seeing. At the current time there are many exhibits designed for children which are all interactive and which our son (5) really enjoyed.

There is great access for strollers and people with disabilities and the grounds and ground floor can be wandered around without paying the entirely reasonable entrance fee (S$6 if I remember correctly).

A must see on any itinerary."
,,Good exhibition but most of museum closed,3.0,,"The building itself is very impressive and worth seeing for that alone. However, two levels of the museum are closed. I visited the Singapura 700 a Years exhibition, which was very good. It included a short film from 1938 and Japanese newsreel footage of the invasion. There is an entry fee of $6 and $3 for seniors for this exhibition."
,,An impressive and beautiful landmark,5.0,,"This is a must do thing being in Singapore . The iconic building reminds one of the big one era . The collections are impressive . The entrance nominal,fee and the easy access are added advantages ."
,,Best Museum Ever Seen,4.0,,"One of main attraction in singapore, ticket price are fair enough, place is located in central singapore and the museum have complete story of singapore from the beginning till now.. must visit here if you coming to singapore."
,,Excellent Singapore History Museum,5.0,,"Very close to a metro exit , the Singapore History Museum was showing a special exhibition devoted to the recently deceased founding Prime Minister of Singapore, Lew Kuau. The Museum also has an hands-on children's section and a large gallery devoted to the history of Singapore. The restaurant had a very interesting upscale menu, but was so crowded, we had to move on. The Singapore Art Museum is nearby"
,,Most of Museum closed :( But 700 years of Singapore is great,3.0,,"I am sure this place would be great, however there was only one exhibit open the rest were closed. The one exhibit was 700 years of Singapore which was really informative."
,,700 years of the history of Singapore,5.0,,"A thoroughly researched and in depth exhibition of the history of this island nation. For Americans, particularly Bostonians, look out for the Revere Bell which tells the history of how the daughter of Paul Revere, Maria who was the wife of the American consul, Joseph Balestier, donated the bell to Singapore in the 19th century. There is also a small exhibition depicting the charitable works of pioneer Chinese women and their European counterparts pre and post WW2 and also of the life and work of the first Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew who passed away recently."
,,Learn about history & an interesting museum with swinging lights!,4.0,,"This is the key museum for Singapore.

There are rotating exhibitions where you can learn more about the history of Singapore and civilizations across the world.

The museum has the historical main building and a modern annexe which has an interactive exhibition on the history of Singapore.

What's interesting about the museum is the row of swing chandeliers at the annexe block which sway from side to side. They are quite a sight!

There are also cafes and restaurants here where you can have a light bite or sit-down meal."
,,Enjoyed the '700 years' exhibit,5.0,,"Starting with some archaeological information the exhibit continues through the civilized history of the area, including both the British and Japanese influences."
,,Interesting exhibits,4.0,,"This museum is well worth a visit. The building is impressive, and entry was free. There are varied and interesting exhibits which are labelled in English as well. I recommend you spend some time here."
,,Not much here,2.0,,"The basic museum is free, and that's a good thing because it offers almost nothing to see. However, a special exhibit ""700 Years of Singapore"" was definitely worthwhile and worth the nominal entrance fee. Otherwise, calling this a ""National Museum"" is a bit of a stretch - on view was a love-piece memorial to the late ruler Lee Kuan Yew, and an insubstantial exposition on the historical role of women in Singaporean society. In such a formidable, historical building, there should be a permanent, much more authoritative and substantial exhibit on Singaporean history. Gift shop felt like a political-party-bookstore + a few nicknacks. On the plus side, there is excellent air conditioning throughout the building, and the caf√© has a nice menu and very friendly, attentive staff."
,,Visit with neighbours and family,3.0,,"Last visit was almost 3 years ago and after some recent milestone events in Singapore, we thought its timely to revisit.

We went for the LKY Memory and Singapura 700 events.

Most of us, or at least me, were taught with Singapore history from the days of Sang Nila Utama. I was surprised to learn that our island were visited and occupied since 700 years back.

I hope we can dig up more artefacts and shed light on the early history of Singapore more.

The display of LKY in memory was a brief display of LKY during the formative years of our nation. Informative but lack dept. But sufficient for most I guess.

Good a revisit but probably won't return for another few years... I wonder what's necessary to make museum more attractive and visits more frequent?"
,,"Not a fan of museums, but loved this one!",5.0,,"Completely amazed at how much I enjoyed my trip to this museum. The current exhibition about the history of Singapore blew me away. It was ecstatically brilliant, very interesting, great flow, and best of all, it kept me interested throughout the full exhibit."
,,Best place to understand Singapore's history,5.0,,"This is the museum you should visit if you want to understand the history of Singapore.
The museum building itself is very beautiful and of historical importance. Inside, there are various halls and exhibits that take you through the history of the land, which we know today as Singapore. Each exhibit has a description written in simple English, which even a child can understand easily, displayed in a well illuminated area. There are a few interactive exhibits too. Everything inside the museum is neat and well organized.

The museum is located within walking distance from Orchard road, and you can be in and out within 2 hours. Its a recommended visit for anyone who is interested in the history of Singapore."
,,"Catch ""Singapura: 700 years""",5.0,,"Although the National Museum is not as prestigious as a few other world renown museums, and is major renovation in preparation for SG50 celebrations, the temporary exhibitions are great windows to know Spore better.

In Memoriam: Lee Kuan Yew not only marks the end of LKY's celebratory life, it also tells a story of a nation. This exhibit ends in Jun 2015.

Singapura: 700 years shares the complete journey of Spore to-date. Even as a citizen, I didn't know our history went back 700 years ago. It's most ideal if visitors can first take the free guided tours host by the friends of museum volunteers, followed by a second round of tour on your own. I also found some childhood memories of the cabinet TV, transmission radio and a rotary phone. Three of us, a mum and 9, 13 year old, enjoyed this tremendously. Check out for the timing of the free tours. This exhibit ends on Aug 10.

Certainly hope both of these could be included in the museum's permanent exhibits.

Bonus: includes a Shaw Brothers related exhibit and another one that celebrates women.

Extra bonus: tea special at the cafe was great too!"
,,Great history of Singapore,4.0,,"This place can see all types of history in Singapore. Before we became independence and Japanese Occupation. This island is already more then 700 years. Which make me understand more about my own country.

This museum is been many year maintain this shape and size. It got great view and eating area although most of the area are free but some need to be pay. It always crowd during weekends. Most of them are family members, students, tourism.

Best to go is weekdays and must not be school holiday because school holiday will crowd the area."
,,average,3.0,,"Not so much to see exclude the exhibitions. you could enter the national museum for free, but to enjoy the exhibition, you have to pay the entrance fee."
,,Many rooms closed for renovation,4.0,,"This is one of the 4 national museums in Singapore. Unfortunately, most of the rooms are currently closed for renovation.

The first objective is to describe Singapore's history. At the moment, there is an exhibition about the country's founder Lee Kwan Yew who passed away a few months ago. You can also see this exhibition in a digitize format in the museum's website."
,,Interesting exhibitions,4.0,,"We found the History of Singapore exhibition to be both interesting and informative. It is well set out and there are some very interesting photos from earlier times.
The Lee Kuan Yue exhibition was also very interesting. Whilst I had known that he was the leader of Singapore, I had not realised how visionary he was.
We had lunch at the cafe located between the old and new sections the food was quite nice.
You can walk to the Fort Canning Park from the rear of the museum building -so you can spend several hours in this area."
,,Family day out @Singapore,4.0,,We went on Bus to visit Singapore National Museum to explore the culture and art of ancient history. Liked the architecture of Museum and the display it was amazing. Must visit place for children.
,,"Great building, good museum, few average exhibits, but enough to get your attention for couple of hours",4.0,,"Like I mentioned in the title, the building is fantastic. But exhibits are ok. Guess there is not much of history to be documented, but the curators have made the most of what they have. I felt there was something missing, but I can say with certainty that I was entertained for few hours."
,,Mixed,4.0,,"Like so many museums this was a rather mixed bag.

It's free on for most of it. The big exhibtion was on 700 years of Singapore history. You have to pay $6, I think, in to see this. I enjoyed this especially the section on WW2 as I learned a good bit about the Japanese occupation. There was also a section on Lee Kuan Yew, the PM of Singapore for 25 years who has recently died, I learned a bit about him but I would have liked a bit more. It did make me want to get his autobiography so in that way it did the job.

The rest of it is a bit meh. A section on Singapore music from last 50 years just seemed a bit random. A few other exhibitions didn't really appeal to me either.

They are in process of making an exhibition on Singapore's 50th anniversary later this year. It will be worth visiting when that is on."
,,Currently most exhibition halls closed,3.0,,"The museum is housed in a beautifully restored historic building (old Raffles library and museum building built in 1887) with a modern annex attached at the rear. On my visit only two small free galleries were open (currently Leading Ladies and In Memoriam) and a fee paying gallery in the basement (history of Singapore). While a number of other galleries are due to reopen soon with new exhibitions, I was very disappointed that more was not open during my visit. I would strongly recommend checking their website before visiting. The museum is an easy five minute walk from Dhoby Ghaut MRT station (not well sign posted so have a map at the ready) and a number of public buses stop almost at the door. There is a cafe / restaurant on site (level 1) and a drink vending machine (reasonably priced) on level 2."
,,Nice museum,3.0,,"A small museum with limited history to display, but well presented and interesting parts that you can enjoy for 1-2 hours"
,,Good value and good for a morning/arvo,4.0,,"Although Singapore's history isn't too long, it is well presented here - showing the transition from a 3rd world country to a bustling 1st world city-state. Still good value but a lot is under construction for the 50th anniversary of Singapore."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,Just go and experience the history of this unique and wonderful place. Especially as they have lost their leader during their fiftieth year of independence. Superb
,,"Beautiful building, disappointing exhibition",3.0,,"I took my children to visit the museum. It had two free exhibitions. For the exhibition in the basement one had to buy tickets. The free exhibitions were really disappointing to us and we went through it in 15 minutes flat. The building is also know as the ""White House"" - beautiful architecture. Not sure I'll recommend this attraction."
,,A really interesting museum,4.0,,"The museum is a beautiful place.It is a very good place to know the history of the little red dot.
It will be very good if you are able to catch the 2-3 pm guided tour they have.The volunteers are really very knowledgeable and explain everything very well.Their effort must be praised.
Though the exhibits size is small its worth visiting for around 2 hours.
If you are a student then carry your id to singapore you get half price tickets in all museums including this one and at many other places like orchid gardens(usual is 5sgd for students 1sgd)"
,,Gripping and visually stunning!,5.0,,"This place is really more like several museums in one, covering so much history and time it's amazing. I mean, sure, it's a National museum, but you don't get the all encompassing feeling looking at it from the outside. Once you get in...that's when you really start to get it. I spent roughly 6 hours in the museum and really took my time with exhibits. my only regret was not being able to locate a curator and tell them just how impressed I was with the place. If you're hitting Singapore and you love museums this one is not to be missed!"
,,Very Educational,4.0,,Very nice Museum to learn and see the history of Singapore. I joined the guided tour and found this very educational.
,,Fine museum,4.0,,This museum provides visitors with a good background on the cultural heritage of Singapore. A very nice facility with modern exhibits. Some were closed when we visited but it was a very enjoyable visit.
,,Good fun for all ages,4.0,,"Visited the museum to see the Lee Kuan Yew exhibition. Very information static displays, though it would be nice to see more than just information boards and only ~6 pieces of personal items.

Kids had a lot of fun at PLAY and the colouring room. Given it was a visit on a public holiday, a little disappointing that they shut the stairs leading up to PLAY leaving only 1 lift accessing the higher levels resulting in a rather long wait."
,,"Wonderful museum, informative and well put together",5.0,,"Wonderful museum, clean, well laid out, great unique exhibitions, educating you on so many thiBa about Singapore, most of the exhibitions are free and it's very central, definitely worth a trip"
,,Informative exhibits,5.0,,"We explored the ""700 years of Singapore history"" with a guided English tour guide and the memorial exhibit for Singapore‚Äôs first Prime Minister and founding father Lee Kuan Yew. It was a delightful way to spend the morning."
,,Under renovation,2.0,,"Like most of Singapore at present - it was under construction in preparation for the 50th Anniversary of Singapore's Independence. Obviously this is an important time in the history of Singapore, however it was a shame to visit the national museum to be told that ALL permanent exhibitions are closed for renovation. I have never been to a national museum that cannot offer anything! Such a shame because the building is wonderful inside and out and I wish I could have spent more time there."
,,Excellent Museum,5.0,,When I visited there was an excellent exhibit on Lee Kuan Yew on the 3rd floor in addition to the Singapura 700 years gallery in the basement. I found both to be really informative and well laid out. This was one of the most enjoyable experiences of my trip.
,,Fantastic learning experience,5.0,,The SINGAPURA: 700 Years exhibit was ace! My girlfriend and I slowly followed a small school group around so we could listen in on the teacher explaining each exhibit. Would definitely recommend pretending to read a pamphlet or plaque until such a group comes along in order to enhance your learning experience.
,,Old things are charming,4.0,,"The 'SINGAPURA: 700 years' galleries has a display of a traditional game that no longer exists in the new playgrounds. My class had a whale of a time playing on it. They also played on the hopscotch.
The display of the old telephone attracted their attraction too."
,,National Museum of Singapore,5.0,,i enjoyed to saw a 700 years of picture so we can see museum again. hope i can visited in national museum
,,national museum with class,5.0,,I went to Singapore national museum with 24 of my classmate and 2 teachers. We visited the exhibition about 700 year. Everybody included teacher needed the sticker ticket to enter the gallery about the life in the past. We took a class photo inside the museum. I like the merry-go-round because I and my classmate spin around and around If spin too fast it will make a lot for noise and I like the traditional game. Went we go out of the gallery I lost my sticker ticket then I ask teacher about losing the ticket. After that we went to Lee kuan yew exhibition and good feedback about lee kuan yew.
,,Exciting place to go for everybody,5.0,,"Trip to National Museum at Dhoby Ghaut
We went to the National Museum with 26 students and 2 of our teachers. We went to the museum by bus. It was a thrilling trip as we get to see a lot of interesting building. When we reach there, there were a lot of people at the Waiting Place where they were waiting for the bus.
There was an LKY Exhibition near the waiting area and many tourists were at the exhibition. We went to Basement 1 of the Museum where there is SINGAPURA: 700 years exhibition where we could take a step back to 700 years ago to see the history of Singapore.
I like the 700 years exhibition as there was a lot of things that is my favourites. I even took a lot of pictures in the Exhibition.
The things that I like was the Television and the Cradle Telephone. There was even a Hopscotch and a Merry-Go-Round. The Merry-Go-Round is rarely found in the Modern Singapore.
After that, we went up to the 2nd floor to visit Mr Lee Kuan Yew‚Äôs Exhibition as there was a Singapore flag, The Red Box that was used to keep Mr Lee‚Äôs Documents in it.
We were so enthusiastic that we had to went back to school. I would recommend this place to everybody as you will get to see a lot of interesting things that will make you excited to go again."
,,Singapore Museum,4.0,,its was my first visiting there and its was fun and exiting . i went there with classmate and teacher . i like the memories of lee kuan yew . i read alot about him .But inside the exhibition the mirror at the was cool because we can take selfie and toilet was big and clean . i wish to go there again next time
,,Museum with a maze,5.0,,"I went to National Museum with 24 of my friends and 2 teachers on Wednesday 29 April 2015. We all visited the exhibitions , SINGAPURA 700 year ago and in Memoriam about Lee Kuan Yew .Everybody and my teachers needed a ticket to enter the gallery about life in the past. I like how they use mirrors in the galleries. It makes the place feel like a maze."
,,Memorable Trip,3.0,,"On the 29th April, Wednesday, I went to the National Museum. I went there with my classmates and my teachers. We took a school bus from our school to the National Museum.
We saw a lot of things over there, we visited the Singapore History Gallery. It was nice to see the old things we used to live with. We only thought there were only the History of Singapore but it was a luck we got to visit the Memoriam of Mr.Lee Kuan Yew, It made me misses so much of the old Singapore. Everything there was just so much memory.
I like everything about the Museum. It really is going to be a mermorable day for me visiting the Museum."
,,A very interesting place full of histories.,5.0,,"On the 29th of April. I went to the Singapore National Museum. I go there by bus. I went there with my teachers and my classmates. When we reach there, we straight away went to the SINGAPURA: 700 years. The gallery contains a lot of old stuff. It was all about Singapore history. The old stuff was quite smelly. I like the traditional games corner in the exhibit. I would recommend this to my friends from other countries. And if you like history, you will like this museum."
,,The peace,4.0,,"On the 29th of April 2015, I went to the National Singapore Museum. I went there with my classmates and teachers we took a school bus from our school to the National Singapore Museum.
We went there for our Learning-journey, when we arrive at National Singapore Museum we saw a lot of foreigners that from different country. We saw a lot of things over there, we even visited the Singapore History Gallery. It was nice to see the old things that come from the past.
We only thought there were the History of Singapore but it was a luck we got to visit the Memoriam of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, It made me misses so much of the old Singapore. Everything there was just so much memory.
I like everything about the Museum. It really is going to a memorable day for me visiting the museum"
,,"""Smells""",4.0,,"The Place Is Very White In Color It Is The First Thing You Will See When You Are Outside But I Was With My Class And 2 Other Teachers So We Were In The Bus Bay The Entrance To The Museum Is Very Guarded With Security And Cameras, The Inside Is Very Different From What You Will Expect, We Went Into Gallery Exhibition 2 (SINGAPURA 700) The History Is So Vivid With Culture But Also Filled With Singapore's Bad Times Like Its War Against Japan, The Smells Was About The Smell Of The Past Which Were Surprisingly Nice Except The Smells Of Fear With Is Urine, All Around Good With Air-Con For Singapore's Hot Weather"
,,national museum of singapore,5.0,,Today I Went to the National Museum with MY teacher and my Classmates and it was quite a wonderful experience going there. We saw many exhibits and we saw the Singapura 700 years Exhibit and I saw the LKY Memoriam .I loved all the Exhibits as they talked about Singapore 50 year History and I liked the traditional games corner as it was quite fun sitting on the merry ‚Äìgo-round .
,,for getting to know Singapore more,4.0,,"I went with my class for a learning journey, there was not many people as it was on the week day in the early afternoon. We went to the exhibit about Singapore 700 years. There was many things to see but my most favourite part of the whole trip was the different scent we got to smell during the tour, many of it was a very good smell but some of it did not smell as good. After the exhibit we went to the Mr Lee Kuan Yew memorial exhibition there was many cards that were wrote by many different people for all to see. There was also the famous red that Mr Lee owned. For the whole trip I had lots of fun and got to learn and see thing I had never seen before. It‚Äôs a place where many people can go visit with friends and family. Not to say anymore or on I well spoil the trip for those who really want to go, hope you all have fun!!!"
,,"""VISITING THE GREAT MAN MR LEE KUAN YEW""",5.0,,Me and my classmates when there on a learning journey to visit the museum and we saw Mr lee kuan yew we admire Mr lee kuan yew so much that we wanted to pay respect to the late Mr lee kuan yew
,,Dot on the map has 700 year old history,4.0,,"Visiting the National Museum you really hear about Singapores history - 700 years ago! There is an entrance fee of S$6 (aprox 3.50 euros) and S$3 for over 60's. Make sure to get a free guided tour as the guide is so passionate, energetic and humorous that you just want to hear more about this little 'Dot on the map'.Rags to riches story amazing! Mrs Pauline Ong who guided us was exceptional, the free tour was at 2pm but check before hand what the scheduled times are. They have interactive exhibitions which are under renovation and expected to be open around August. Special memorial exhibition on for first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew the visionary."
,,Honoring the Great Man of Singapore,5.0,,"We went here upon learning that there's a tribute for Hon. Lee Kuan Yew. We admire him so much that we wanted to pay respect. We were happy to see the many photographs, quotations, speeches of him with important people of the world. It was a great experience!"
,,Check if all exibits are open b4 you make the trip!,2.0,,Five of us made our way to the place only to be told there was one exibition open the rest of the place under renovation. They still charged us the $6 per person to see Singaporean History which was about 40 minutes long. Looks like the place is kept open to get people into the restaurant that operates in the building but no real museum value
,,Good place to visit if you love museums,4.0,,"Considering Singapore's history which is not long compared to countries like China, etc., this museum showcased the very best of what it had/has. Could see that efforts have been made to carefully preserve their legacy for the future generations to see.
Was there for LKY's exhibition too (free). There are 4 condolence books placed there and the exhibit will be on for another few weeks if not mistaken. It's a nice place to check out tho not huge."
,,A place to understand the history of Singapore,4.0,,"A great exhibition on the past 700 years of Singapore, so we had a great insight into the history.
They also had an exhibition of Lee Kuan Yew, with a shrine and many historical artefacts. The dedication of the people to him was very evident. We also had the opportunity to sign condolence books."
,,Well worth the time,4.0,,"Many interesting exhibits. A series that were especially fascinating included the history of Singapore thru the ages. Also since there ""founding father"" had just died, an exhibit on his life was available and provided an excellent look into his life."
,,Make time,4.0,,Well worth a visit and a great way to spend a few hours... The museum is undergoing renovation until sept but the displays open are great ...
,,Fantastic place to spend a bit of time.,5.0,,"Cheap, informative and overall a good tour of Singapore history. I wouldn't spend too long here, but it's definitely a GREAT way to catch up on Singapore history and aspects of life pre-2000's. p.s Best bathrooms in Singapore."
,,Temporary exhibit 700 years of Singapura,4.0,,"I visited the temporary exhibit '700 years of Singapura' and paid student price of $3 which was very good value.

I also managed to catch a free tour guided by Jennavieve (sorry if incorrect spelling!) who was an excellent tour guide. This was a great hour long tour which although was more than an introduction, whisked through the exhibition. I went back through the exhibition again afterwards, to look at all there was not time for at first.

Overall a great exhibition worth visiting if you have the time and want to learn about Singapore's history."
,,Interesting exhibitions,4.0,,"If you are in Singapore for the first time and like history, this is the place to visit. The museum is not to big, so you'll will finish in less than half a day, which I think is more than enough time."
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"If you have a couple of hours to spare, museum is worth a visit. Set in a beautiful building close to Fort Canning Park. One of the floors was closed off but this was reflected in reduced entrance fee. The exhibition on story of Singapore was interesting especially the part on the Japanese occupation. They do have a gift shop, children's play area and restaurant."
,,Nice Museum,4.0,,"Singapore has many great Museums, this is just one of them. They have some great history displays here as well as some interesting special films. Check their site for what's on display and what films are being showed."
,,Renovations -,3.0,,"History of Singapore - a minimalist exhibition although interesting to gain an succinct understanding of Singapre's history and development.

In the celebration of the occasion of Singapore being independent for 50 years, much of the museum is closed for renovations.. Unusual timing to say the least!! As a consolation there's a discounted price! Much of the gift shop is over priced however.

The museum building itself is worth a look!!"
,,Great history.,4.0,,"Great quick way to learn the vast history of Singapore from the early trading days to now. The exhibition of Lew Kuan Hew was great to read, other leaders should take a leaf out of his book."
,,Love this place,5.0,,"A must visit for all tourists and even Singaporeans. Child and disablity friendly. There are two playrooms for the kids (even adults like it, i do!) that is open till 6pm daily. And an outdoor place for the kids to write freely on the blackboards - so fun!"
,,Bad timing for renovations,3.0,,"They really should have had this place fully open and ready for the year Singapore turns 50. Bad timing for the renovations, guys! Hopefully things will be done soon. Until that day, the museum really won't be as good as it should be. The existing display of the history of this young country was well-presented, but I really expected to see more in this museum."
,,History of Singapore,4.0,,"At the time of our visit to the Museum a lot of the museum was closed for renovations but they did have the History of Singapore exhibit, which is well worth a look, I found it to be very interesting."
,,Incredibly Interesting!!,5.0,,"This is an incredibly well done museum that gives you the complete picture on the history of Singapore. I would not wanted to have missed this. To miss it, is to miss the real Singapore. Plan to devote at least 2 hours to this even though we spent about 3 hours. Take time to read all the panels. Afterwards on an upper floor they have a display dedicated to the war crimes committed by the Japanese against the British in Singapore in WW2. That part really gives you the whole story about the sadness of war. At the end of the museum, you can go into a computer screen that is projected on the wall and take a test of everything you saw about the history of Singapore. You choose your answers and everyone can see what your score was! It was fun to take the test--just realize you may not score well!! Cost to enter was about $6sgd--a real bargain!!"
,,Very interesting way to spend an afternoon,4.0,,"We visited this museum to find out about the history of Singapore and it lived up to expectations. We joined a free, 1 hour tour guided group with a very informative American lady telling us some interesting facts about Singapore's past. The exhibition itself was very well laid out and easy to read and understand. We spent over 3 hours there overall and thoroughly enjoyed it. Would recommend."
,,Great short History of Singapore,4.0,,The history of Singapore is explicitly shown with exhibits here. Very topical at this time with the passing of Lee Kuan Yew. The museum has what it takes to present all it has very successfully in short. A very pleasant and accommodating environment...especially for Singapore
,,Good for history buffs,4.0,,"I thoroughly enjoyed the 700 yrs of singapore exhibition, sadly the2nd and 3rd floor was closed for renovation. However the exhibition was excellent, and the park grounds around the building is lovely too"
,,Visiting the Singapore Museum is like unpacking a Tiffin!,5.0,,The Singapore Museum has layers of history and interesting displays. I particularly like the self guided audio tour of the history of Singapore itself. Well worth the visit.
,,Crowded with a tour,3.0,,"Much of this museum was closed, and the parts that were open were inundated with Tour groups. But th retrospective on the Japanese war was worth the trip. I had no idea how over-prepared the Japanese were to occupy countries like Singapore. There was a graphic that compared the Japanese forces to Allied forces and the Allies had no chance! It was often 60 to 1 and the Japanese pretty much walked in and took names. We saw a lot of images of the camps where the Japanese imprisoned the British and Singapore people. And then of course there was the payback when the Singaporians deported the Japanese. Very informative exhibit."
,,Main exhibits closed for renovation but still worth a visit,4.0,,"The only exhibits currently open are the '700 years of Singapore' ($6) entry and the Japanese War Crimes trial exhibit (free). Main exhibits reopen in Sep 2015.

It took me 1.5 hours to do the 2 exhibits above and whilst I enjoyed it, there were hardly any artefacts as part of the exhibit. Mainly text and pictures. Still I leant a lot and did enjoy it as well as the wonderful building it is located in."
,,Too simple,2.0,,"The museeum itself its well appointed and very well kept, unfortunately the exhibits are simple and lack the deep research I was looking for.

I got the gist of the Singapore history and foundation but, I ended up with the idea that they really don't know much about the early settlements."
,,good historical place,5.0,,a nice place..well kept..loved this place.. submission fee cheap and affordable.. easy to find too..
,,OMG!,4.0,,"I saw a Liechtenstein art and it was really good! All the collections are from 1500-1800's. I would love to visit again since every week there are new exhibition to show. Anyway, the museum's collection itself has a very adorable and communicative. I should have it in my own country!"
,,Must see,4.0,,Nice museum depicting with precision the history of Singapore and its mixing of cultures. A big part is devoted to the Japanese invasion of the city during WWII. A must see
,,Great Museum,5.0,,We enjoyed this museum greatly. It provided us much more history of Singapore then we ever imagined. It helped deepen our appreciation of what this country went through.
,,Interesting exhibitions,4.0,,"Still largely closed for renovation but currently two exhibitions on.
First is paid entry and covers history of Singapore. Gives good overview of history of the island and helps understand the complex nature of the island and the ethnic mix of its residents.
Second exhibition (free) covers some of the trials of Japanese soldiers for war atrocities. Only a short exhibition but informative.
The building itself is an attractive mix of the old and new and has a very pleasant environment. Children's play area on third floor, did not visit this part but it is free. Well done to the museum for providing this facility.
Plenty of toilets and two catering facilities."
,,Mostly closed just now,3.0,,Hard to rate this place as most of is closed for a big reorganisation. We saw a fairly basic exhibition on Singapore's history which gave us a good overview to get our bearings at the start of a visit to Singapore. The show is admirably - or maybe strangely - even-handed on the Japanese invasion and its associated atrocities..
,,Interesting history of Singapore,4.0,,"As others have mentioned, currently the museum is under a good deal of construction and a lot of the exhibits are closed. We visited the 700 years of Singapore display (which there is a slight fee for). We did the tour and I learned a lot about the history of Singapore. I do have to say I was a little disappointed because it felt more just like a history lesson with pictures, but very few actually historical relics that one would normally see in a museum. I do recommend doing the tour though, especially if you are unfamiliar with Singapore's history because it's quite fascinating and informative."
,,World's best Merlion biology display,4.0,,"Museum closures seem endemic these days, with Berlin and Singapore affected when I came by. But somehow I managed to find a day when the Singapore museum reopened to the public, and took the opportunity. It is a lovely, airy building, with good natural light and a strict ""no pictures"" policy.

I think that means that my pictures of the Merlion biology display are quite rare and valuable... The Merlin is a symbol of Singapore, a lion with a fish body. At the museum they have a display of the development of the Merlin from embryo to adult, by a local artist as I recall.

Singapore is a wonder of the modern world, thanks to the foresight and personal strength of the founder and his family. The Museum gives light on the background of the region, country and culture. Recommended."
,,not worth your time,2.0,,"Went there to learn some history about Singapore, and there was only 1 exhibit open. I learnt about the history of Singapore which was interesting, but unless you check ahead of time to see if exhibits are open, it's not worth your money. Most things were closed and under construction, so it was a waste of a day. The building itself is beautiful so that was a plus side, but otherwise, just walk up to Fort Canning and learn the same things."
,,Find out how Singapore developed,5.0,,"The permanent display is currently closed, however the temporary exhibition on 700 years of Singapore‚Äôs history is well worth a visit. If you visit their website, don‚Äôt get confused when they say the gallery about the history is closed, the temporary exhibition is what you‚Äôll see and enjoy.
It actually covers all that is known about Singapore, from 2000 years ago to the present day. Information is presented in a lively way. We particularly loved a film showing Singapore in 1938.
The exhibition is free for residents, visitors pay S$6 (older people like me pay S$3)
There were ample places to sit down for a rest. There are expensive restaurants in the building, but nothing suitable for a light snack. We bought coffee nearby before starting our visit. Museum toilets are easy to find and very clean.
The more you know of Singapore, the more you‚Äôll get from visiting. However tourists on their first visit will learn a lot about Singapore‚Äôs history which will enhance their pleasure while exploring the city."
,,SUPERB PRESENTATION,5.0,,"Visited the special exibition of the 700 YEARS OF SINGAPORE intending to spend a relatively short time. We spent hours learning of the different aspects in the history of this wonderful city and country. Each and every timespan was displayed and explained in an ideal manner. Everything was done in such a sympathetic way which made it more meaningful and interesting. Every culture was recognised and it was shown how each nationality had contributed to the wealth and history and even more important the future of the country,. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and ended by having refreshments at the welcoming bistro."
,,History of Singapore,4.0,,"Visited in Jan 2015. It is situated right next to YMCA, One Orchard rd. It was opened by Governor Sir F.A.Weld in 1887. Only one display was open cause of renovation. 700 Years of Singapore starting from 1299, when Sri Tri Buana arrived in Temasek and renamed the island Singapura. I was glad I got the chance to visit. Couple of videos were on display where you can watch the history of Singapore unfolds right before your eyes. The museum was a bit too dark for my taste with insufficient lighting and had to lean real close to all the displays to read the descriptions.

There are free guided tours of the museum but there were none when I was there. You can check the official website for the timings before you go. There is also a visitor's shop, but the price was little too much and you can get all of the items from chinatown at a cheap price. Entry fee is 6 Singapore dollars per adult and 3 Singapore dollars for senior citizen. For tourists planning on visiting, make sure you got your passport handy. Kopitiam and few other eateries right outside, for those who gets tired by too much walking around the museum. They got few indoor food shops as well. It's always great to know the history of a country you're visiting. Most of the museum was closed, so I will surely be back when it's fully open for public."
,,A Concise History of Singapore,4.0,,"Due to refurbishments to upgrade and coincide with their 50 years of independence , only one display is open, 700 Years of Singapore.

It was a well laid out, extensive and informative history of Singapore to the current day.

The colonial and Japanese occupation displays are especially well done.

Entry is $6 and the opening hours are 10am to 6pm"
,,Hopefully better for you,4.0,,We got a good welcome here from lovely staff and the exhibition of Singapore history was good. The history is interesting and the exhibition is rightly proud of what has been achieved by Singaporeans. It is a magnificent building. But most of it was closed - hopefully there will be more to see when you visit.
,,Very informative,4.0,,"I enjoyed my visit to the museum. Up until then, I had no idea of Singaporean history. The displays were very informative and set up so you could take in and understand most of the key hisotrical points.I liked everything leading up to the WWII exhibits."
,,A Walk Through SG's History,4.0,,"Last year, I went to the National Museum of Singapore with my friends to search for historical sources for a History project that we were assigned to complete.

,,Good museum,4.0,,"This museum's claims to be cutting edge are a little overstated, but it is nonetheless a world class institution. The Singapore History gallery is worthy of several hours, and tells the story of Singapore extremely well with the help of an audio guide."

,,Under renovation,2.0,,"Only the Singapore 700 exhibition was available to see and it was unfortunately rather ordinary, nothing special.

,,Museum with limited display items,3.0,,"Recently visited National Museum with great expectation since it is being advertised as the largest museum of Singapore but I was disappointed to find that a large section of the Museum was closed. The limited display was about 700 years of Singapore history showing some excavated items and couple of old items and some old photographs and brief write-up about various communities that have come from China, India and other continents. It was educative in the sense it that we came to now more about origin of Singapore and its transformation into a democratic independent Nation state in 1965."
,,Love this museum's dynamic displays,5.0,,"I happily go back to this museum on a regular basis as they are always having no exhibits to see. They really make the use of the space and give you some great experiences and sights to see. You learn a huge amount too. The architecture is also stunning.

Highly recommended."
,,Better to visit after 2015,3.0,,We visited In Nov 2014.Although it gives you a complete idea about the history of Singapore but it is under renovation.So it advisable to visit after 2015 when the renovation is done.
,,Better After September 2015,3.0,,"With most of the museum closed for remodeling until September 2015, there's not much to see here. However, as others have said, the Singapura 700 Years exhibit is enlightening and worth a quick look.

Hope to return in late 2015 for a full view of the museum's collection."
,,Best Way to Understand Singapura's History,5.0,,"Although we went hoping to see the WWII Exhibit located on the second level, we found that level currrently closed for remodeling. No matter, we were not disappointed in the museum. The exhibit Singapura:700 Years was excellent. We learned so much about the pre-colonial and colonial times, commerce's influence, wartime and the struggle for Independence. Well done and well worth the time we spent here. Countries in today's world could take a lesson from Singapore's history and valor. I even learned the words to the Singaporean Pledge of Allegiance. ""We, as citizens of Singapore, pledge ourselves to forget differences of race, language and religion and become one united people; to build a democratic society where justice and equality will prevail and where we will seek happiness and progress by helping one another."" How beautiful is that?"
,,Great introduction to Singapore art and culture!,4.0,,"The external and interior appearance of the museum were impressive but sad to say we were disappointed that during our visit majority of the parts of the museum were closed due to ongoing renovation and restoration. Although we were notified prior to paying our entrance fee, we didn't expect that the displays were truly limited.

If only the whole place were open that time, we are pretty sure that we will truly appreciate the whole museum. The museum is spacious with several floors to explore that houses galleries and exhibits. Large glass paneled windows that provided direct sun lights added warm and coziness to the whole place. The art galleries are well presented with good captions. We did enjoy their exhibits particularly the photo exhibit that time.

To reach the National Museum, ride MRT and get off at Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station. Take Exit A and walk a few steps. It is adjacent to YMCA One Orchard Hotel.

Although we have seen limited exhibits and displays, we still believe that this Museum is a great introduction to Singapore art and culture."
,,Good place to learn the history,4.0,,"Like: perfect place to learn history, audio visual is perfect Dislike: you really need to spend a lot of time to fully cover the whole history..."
,,a glimpse of singapore,4.0,,"to understand more on the culture and know a little history of a country, a visit to a museum is highly recommended.:-) there is a free guided tour or you may want to use their headphones if you want to explore it by yourself."
,,Their free guided tour is the best introduction to Singapore,5.0,,"I joined the free tour that the museum offers and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

They offer free tours daily and their in-house guides are excellent. They walk you through you the entire history of Singapore in an hour, using their exhibits to illustrate the story. It's comprehensive, concise and professional. I had an Australian lady, who was excellent. And my mother went a couple of weeks later and was guided by a Singapore gentlemen who was also superb.

I highly recommend you do this tour as soon as you get off the plane; and the rest of your stay will make so much more sense."
,,Top floor is fun for kids,3.0,,The top floor of the museum has a number of free activities for kids and didn't seem too busy when we visited on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Floors 1 and 2 seem to be under renovation but there's a display in the basement which we didn't visit.
,,Making history interesting!,4.0,,"They know how to do things in Singapore and the history gallery in the national museum is no exception. Have a good look at the exterior of the building before you enter..it's very photogenic. The history gallery is in an extension at the rear and was the only part open when we visited. You only pay $6 to enter( $3 for senior citizens ) and it is money well spent. The word museum sometimes conjours up images of dusty exhibition cases but certainly not here. 700 years of history are displayed and non flash photography is allowed. Everything was so well done....typical Singapore really. Don't rush!
When you've finished, there is a cafe and a well stocked souvenir shop.
Probably the easiest way to get to the museum is by using the MRT and the museum is a few minutes walk from Dhoby Ghaut station."
,,Get yourself here!,5.0,,"What a museum!! I gave up around 3 hours of my day to learn more about Singapore and this was the perfect place for it. As they are currently renovating a large section of the museum, the 100 Year exhibit was a snip at S$6 and if you time it well, you can tag along to one of the free tours - 11am was the one I joined. Worthwhile taking up the free tour and gives you that bit more information.

They also have a cool photo exhibition and a lovely gift shop.

I'm not a big museum person but really enjoyed this place, it must have been good!!!"
,,Relaxing day trip,3.0,,"A free attraction for Singaporeans. To enter the exhibition gallery on the ground floor, one needs to get a ticket from the front desk at level 1. Will be better if a signage is placed prominently near the entrance so there is no need to backtrack. My 4year old child enjoyed the play area on level 3."
,,Great way to learn more about Singapore,5.0,,700 years of Singapore's history was featured during my visit that cost 6 SGD. It was a very good exhibition. I learned a lot about the country's history. I also appreciate the architecture of the museum itself. It was elegant and well-made such as what one would expect in a first world country.
,,Worthwhile exhibit,5.0,,"Though all the permanent exhibits were closed, there is a temporary exhibit of 700 years of Singapore history. It is quite well-conceived, with thoughtful use of many different presentation materials and media (video, reproduction articles, maps, old pictures, dioramas).

Coverage of Singapore history appeared to be extensive but a bit short at the end. Much attention was given to colonial times and the Japanese occupation, then suddenly the rest is condensed, as if the organizers suddenly realized they were out of space.

Still, I spent a good two hours at the exhibit, and recommend it to all visitors."
,,Free Guided Tour,5.0,,"The National Museum is close to YMCA in Orchard Road. Entrance fee to the museum includes guided tour which was really informative. I believe the tourist guide in our group was a British lady and was really entertaining while narrating the story of Sir Stamford Raffles and how he found Singapore. The museum was small but so amusing and very engaging. Restaurants were pricey, as usual."
,,History,5.0,,a place to get all info about the history of Singapore...a nice place with lots of things to see...a nice audio visual show about the history of Singapore...one may also bump into models who are doing some photo shoot in the museum.
,,Could be much better,2.0,,"We have to say, we took a free docent led tour of the history exhibition and left early. Frequently, there were not artifacts presented, but representations of items -- long poles representing mangroves, fake rocks, etc. It's not that the facts weren't interesting, it's just that it could have been presented in a better manner."
,,Complete history of Singapore,5.0,,"For a mere Singapore$6 you get a tablet, earphones and access to a self-guided tour through the history of Singapore - from it earliest murky origins as a settlement, to the trauma of WWII and up to the modern day. Artefacts, letters, photos, films‚Ä¶ too much to take in!"
,,Professional and memorable presentation of Singapore's history,4.0,,A professional presentation of Singapore's history from inception to modern day. On the day we visited food and fashion galleries were closed. Overall very informative and we spent enjoyable 3.5 hrs going through the audio guides. Young kids may find it boring would say it is suitable for ages 10+
,,Not a museum,1.0,,Very few areas of the building were open. This was not advertised in advance. Only the history of singapore and a photo exhibit. History of Singapore was stretched out with few really interesting items. Way too long. Audio on device would not sync on many exhibits. The building itself is magnificent. More a mausoleum than a museum.
,,Hidden gems if you're looking properly,5.0,,"Ok, so I went to the museum not expecting too much, I had time so I thought I'd waste it at the SNM...I ended up spending 5 1/2 hours there...and still didn't see everything. Probably another 5 hrs required...next time :)

Let me start by saying I'm no propeller head!

If you read some previous reviews they talk about not much there and not enough curation...WRONG! I initially thought this too. Most of the museum in the primary part of the building has closed down, there were only 2 sections here, a food history and a photography section. Interesting but I was a little disappointed.

My advice, just go to the food section read the plaques and listen the audio. About 15-20 mins max.

Then move to the historical walk towards the back of the museum.

If you want to know about Singapore's history, it's all here.

You need the audio guide..it's a must. My advice, read, watch and listen to as much as you can...and take your time, it's not a race ;)

How it works

Once you get down to the belly of the exhibit there are 2 paths, an events path (milestones events) and a personal path (culture, people and places).

I took the events path.

There are numbers on the floor that match numbers in your audio player. Play and read them when you reach one of these. Stop and listen. It is both informative and instructional. I saw most people just waking past me..I'm guessing they missed a lot ;)

A section can be broken into a number of smaller sections, these smaller sections have more numbered items about particular pieces...there's quite a lot of detail. Again, from reviews and what a saw there, most people missed this.

Again, take it slowly, read and listen to the audio tracks or you'll miss important information...Esp real interviews from survivors of the WWII Jap invasion/occupation.

Next time I'm in SG I'll take the personal path and kill another half day ;)

My other suggestion is go to Changi Prison next, some of it will make more sense after you've been to the museum. Esp the Chook Sing massacre."
,,Visit here is a must,5.0,,Knowledge is great and that is even greater when it is presented in an educational manner. This museum is interactive and detailed about how Singapore became something from nothing. Its well setup that people who are not into museums as well will appreciate time spend here.
,,Purely educational,4.0,,Been here 5yrs back. Comprehensive history of spore and a little interactive with that audio gadget they give you while on tour. I dunno if they got changes now though
,,nothing interesting...,2.0,,"i took the taxi to get there, full of passion. but i only found that the 1st and 3rd floor has nothing to visit, and half of the 2nd floor was doing a Gallery which was not free, and other half was sealed for TV shooting. After 15 mins wandering, i chose leaving this so called ""Museum""."
,,"Very professional, absorbing museum to visit",5.0,,"I had half a day to pass before my flight and decided to visit the museum. A very grand 160 yr old building filled with som much information and artifacts . Each person is give a touch screen with earphones which provide your own personal tour as you go around and choose what you want further information on. There is a choice of routes one can taken depending if you like facts, figures and events, or you want a more personal tour with interviews and re-enactments. Very very well done and very interesting to learn how Singapore began, grew and bloomed. I would go again for sure. Oh yes, and as a wheelchair user myself - yes it is very accessible"
,,A place to understand Singapore more as a country,5.0,,"I went there specifically to see the Motor Racing exhibit in time for the F1 Singapore Grand Prix. I was impressed by the museum building. The exhibit was for free, and gave a historical account of the development of motor sports in Singapore. The exhibit staff were very friendly and accommodating. There are also other exhibits going on in other sections of the museum, the museum charges a fee for the regular displays."
,,Free Entry from 6-8pm!,4.0,,"After a weary day of walking, this was a nice break. Plus, the good and family displays were my two favourite topics, so it was well worth the trip! The museum is very well laid out and info presented well. Will be back!"
,,"Nice, can easily spend few hours there",4.0,,"May be I was expecting more being a national museum but still nice.
The history gallery is particularly very informative and interesting too. Good to know in depth about historical facts of singapore. Very easy to reach there, both dhoby ghaut and bras basah mrt nearby and tons of buses goes there.
Few things were closed for renovations."
,,National Museum of Singapore,4.0,,"We went there approximately 2 years ago when i was just a high school student and less attracted to historical things such as this kind of museum. Especially in my country, where museums are places where you can find dusty and rusty things that are not being taken care of. So i was not expecting much of it. I was thinking, So yeah, let;s just finish this tour in an hour and grab some lunch.
It took about half an hour to reach this destination, and it was fun. The front yard of this museum, you can see a big shrunken cherry statue where we took many funny photos. And then there we were inside the museum being guide by Miss Ang Lee, local guide to Indonesian people.
Inside the museum we can see many of historical place and things before and after Singapore became this huge. The stuffs are various, such as wedding gowns from the centuries, mode and fashion that area prone to the era, and also designers that are famous. It looks like you're walking through a time machine and found yourself the one one to bring cameras and taking photos. The other thing that i liked is the spices and food section. Where you can smell spices such as peppers, basil and many other local things. You can even smell fresh banana.
I'm expecting more audio-visual experience but they didnt quite have it. But overall the experience is super historical and nice. They must have been done many improvement today."
,,worth the visit,4.0,,"well, i'm not a much fan of museum and they charged 10S$ for entry, but i went there free admission for Singapore Night Festival (annually event).
it;s well organized, with live performance, music, dance, exhibition, etc

it was crowded and we can explore the museum for free, what can be better than that right?"
,,Pretty good..,3.0,,"We actually went there on june 2012. But maybe they havent change much since then. We went there on holiday, so there were exhibitions for kids. My kids love it. They've always enjoy a trip to the museum. There's always something new.

The staffs were friendly and helpful. The whole museum was very clean and well maintaned.
But for me, its kinda like any other national museum, average.

But i still suggest you go there. :)"
,,Good museum but don't use the restaurant,3.0,,Museum is worth a visit. Not much more that an hour needed for the free entry parts though. The restaurant however has diabolical service. Very rude staff.
,,"Such a Young Country, Such a Rich History",5.0,,This museum beautifully presents Singapore's history from many different perspectives. A must see collage of this island State's past going back to the 1400s. The high tech audio video walk through is first class..it all works and presents a valuable and entertaining viewpoint for people of all cultures and interests. Dont rush it.
,,Singapore history in one hour,3.0,,Free tours (11am and later - check their website) - well worth it as the whole of their history is clearly explained by volunteer guides. It helps you understand Singapore better. You can then go back and have a more in-depth look at the exhibits. However there really isn't much to exhibit.
,,"Some interesting exhibits, too much propaganda",3.0,,"We visited the museum on National Day, it was free admission on the holiday and as a result was very crowded. I'm assuming on a normal day there would not be lineups for audio tours. The massive history of Singapore exhibit began by walking into a 360 degree theatre showing images relating to Singapore all while playing a song in the background that seemed to chant 'Singapore' over and over. This was the beginning of an approximately 1 hour Singapore propaganda experience. There were some interesting things from Singapore's early days, but as the exhibit continued I really couldn't help but feel that it was all just promotion for how amazing Singapore is.

That being said, some of the other exhibits were really cool and it's a very clean and modern museum."
,,National museum of singapore,4.0,,The national museum of singapore is centrally located at stamford rd near the Dhoby Ghaut MRT train station. It has mummies and headhunters castes of the past and quite eerie
,,High Tech History,5.0,,"This beautiful museum is design to let visitors learn about the history of singapore. Through the high tech walking buddy, it gives you much interactive details. Whats more, its fully air conditioned. Gives you a break from the heat outdoors. Easily spend hours there"
,,"Interesting exhibition, well executed",4.0,,"This is an impressive museum with top-notch presentation. If you visit both the permanent exhibition on Singapore‚Äôs history as well as additional temporary exhibitions taking place in the building you can easily spend 3-4 hours total. Personally though, the intense study of historical facts makes me tired rather quickly - so I actually visited the museum twice to really take everything in."
,,Stimulating and enjoyable account of Singapore's history,5.0,,"We visited the museum recently and found it to be an absolutely brilliant story of the history of this fascinating city state. The interactive features were very stimulating and the audio commentary was excellent. The only problem is that it is so comprehensive that you need to plan plenty of time if you want to hear about the entire history of SIngapore. But that's a good fault! The museum itself is a fine building which is just a pleasure to walk around, and the cafe is excellent too."
,,Get the full picture,5.0,,"The National Museum is definitely worth a visit if you want to understand the complete history of Singapore and how it has developed over time. You will be given an audio guide which gives you all the information you could possibly need and it gives you the option to learn even more on subjects you are interested in.
We spent a couple of hours in the museum but some may take more because at stages you can choose how you want to learn about a stage in Singapore's history - through a personal point of view (I.e An individual in Singapore) or factual (I.e using dates, figures and actual events). So if you are extremely interested you could complete both routes.
I definitely recommend this to everyone visiting Singapore and there is a nice cafe in there to sit and contemplate the history of this amazing city."
,,"Good museum,good presentation.",4.0,,"The exhibition focuses on the history of Singapore so for a tourist like me it gave a great idea of colonial history and the development of the wonderful modern city of Singapore. Staff are helpful and friendly and the current temporary exhibition, ""Genesis"" is a wow, superb natural history and environmental images."
,,Nice Museum,4.0,,"The Building itself is just beautiful, then all the rooms that cover different things are a bit like Pandora's box, I have no sense of direction, and got lost sometimes, but most other people probably won't, because of that, not sure if we got to see everything, no problem going back when next we visit."
,,Well organized Museum...,4.0,,"This is a very well organized museum. However you don't see much of artifacts in this museum. But you can walk through the history of Singapore with their well organized multi media backed presentation in the museum.

if you have about 2 hrs to spare and if you have a interest on history worth visiting this place.

please make sure that multimedia equipment that you get is working properly. in my case it didn't. so we have to share that.

if you are student, don't forget to bring your ID or student card. there is a sizable discount for the ticket and the staff is so keen to offer you that discount."
,,Thought provoking..,4.0,,"After some 30 years later, I re-visited the National Museum of Singapore. I remember those days when I brought my kids to the museum, there were dinosaur exhibition, artifacts of the Straits Settlements and those of the colonial past. This time the museum has changed so drastically and has elevated to few storeys to include the exhibition at the basement and the children playground at the highest floor. The main galleries are at the 2nd floor that includes the fashion gallery, the film and wayang gallery, the history of Singapore show, etc. I also noticed a restaurant at the ground floor and it appears to be a different experience eating in a museum.

I started with the islands gallery introducing the various islands around Singapore. I wonder when we could visit and explore islands like Pulau Seking, Pulau Hantu, etc. Look like we are opening up more islands for nature exploration and that would gear up our tourism.

As a Singaporean, the history of Singapore, the fashion gallery, the heritage gallery, the wayang gallery don't fascinate me much as these are part of our culture and we have already known them since young. To the foreign tourists, this may interest them. However, I particularly like the old day film shows and the exhbition on photography of Genesis at the basement. It was relaxing just sitting down in the air-conditioned room on a sofa watching the old day films being screened as if you are in a cinema. It was a form of pleasure able to look back and rewind the past.

The photography exhibition, Genesis displayed spectacular and gorgeous photos of great places around the world that has yet to be tampered and damaged by affluent civilization. As I look at the photos in the primitive civilization and the unspoilt beautiful nature and landscape in these areas, I started to wonder if the advent of human technology and sophistication has driven us slowly and eventually to our graveyards. The deforestation of our Earth in pursuit of affluence, materialism and comfort meant we are gradually starving ourselves of oxygen, the only element that are produced by trees and plants during photosynthesis. We should start the reforestation process and return our Earth back to the days of Genesis for the survival of the human race.

I love the great stunning and gorgeous beauty of nature that were depicted in those photos. I could not remember the name of the photographer but his photos provoked deep thinking in me as I walked out of the museum - a return to Genesis for mankind."
,,Nice overview about Singapore's history,5.0,,The museum gave a nice insight into Singapore's history. Tip: have your Singapore Airlines or your student card available as you can receive a discount with it.
,,nice but not much in the permanent exhibition collection,3.0,,"Located & walkable from Bras Basah MRT station. The permanent exhibition consists of the history of Singapore like the fashion, photography, etc but it didn't have much to offer for us to see. The temporary exhibition was superb! For photography enthusiasts, something you should go for -ending on 31st August . Despite that, I love the overall experience.
Free admission for Singapore citizens."
,,Immerse yourself in the history of Singapore,5.0,,"This museum is brilliant - if you have an interest in the history and culture of the places you visit, then the National Museum of Singapore is a delight. Good value for money, as entry tickets include admission to the art galleries and exhibitions too."
,,Worthwhile way to spend a few hours,4.0,,"We had a few hours to spare after we had checked out of our hotel and before our flight left and so we opted to fill the time with a visit to the National Museum. We were very pleased we did as the building is beautiful and the museum is well worth a visit. We opted to join a guided tour as one was just about to start when we arrived. The guide was very friendly and enthusiastic and we enjoyed his commentary. However, you can more easily choose what you want to see if you roam at your own free will. Nevertheless we found our tour very informative and interesting and we would definitely recommend the museum as a worthwhile way of whiling away some time. One word of caution, though ‚Äì we actually had quite a task finding the museum in the first place. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be very well signposted, at least not from the direction from which we came (Raffles Hotel)."
,,Singapore is not all new!,4.0,,"Since so much of what you see in Singapore was built in the last 20-30 years, we found it hard to understand how the city might have grown and changed until we visited the Singapore History Galleries at this museum. It's a very comprehensive review of who and what came before. Visitors can choose different paths to follow depending on their interests in dates and famous figures or social history. Learning about the opium trade and treatment of non-Europeans during the colonial period provided some balance to what is (literally) whitewashed history at the nearby Raffles, Cricket Club and Victoria Memorial Hall."
,,Excellent fascinating,4.0,,"Went for a look expecting to be 2.5 hours.... stayed 3 hours and didn't finish. Well done exhibits. The main history exhibit overuses an ipad... without the ipad... you are lost. I prefer having a choice.
The food and photography exhibits were great. The Japanese occupation was weak and over reliant on personal stories.
The real disappointment was the exhibit concerning independence. ..... very weak and poorly explained.
But overall this is a very good Museum. Inexpensive diverse with interesting special exhibits. You should go."
,,Ok.,2.0,,I had been to many musuem around the world and i would say this musuem wasnt really that fantastic. Quite limited display...maybe if you do not compare it with musuems in other country then this would be ok. Must be our expectation level was being raised beforehand.
,,"Nice but if you are looking for old things, Its not the place",3.0,,"As singapore doesnt have much history, they dont actually have anything INTERESTING there. But corners for child and some stupid workshops"
,,Educational and fun,5.0,,"If you want to learn everything about Singapore, this is where to start. In the Singapore history room, they provide you with a tablet and a headphone and every exhibit is tagged by numbers so you can input those numbers into the tablet and hear all the stories without having to read by yourself as you do in traditional museum. And the admission fee is only SGD10! In addition, the exhibit called We: Defining Stories which is very interesting as they use various photos to tell stories from the time the nation started. For those travelling with children, a few play corners are available and I saw many had a lot of fun with innovative games. Check it out for yourself!"
,,Great experience,5.0,,"We were amazed on how they think through everything. It's a great example on how history is the best way to learn about a country. It is a great place to learn on how Singaporean become what they are now.
Great interactive audio guide, my boys enjoyed exploring the museum on their own pace and interest. There were also seasonal exhibition. In our case was the Genesis photography exhibition, which was superb.
Spare enough time to explore everything that it offers."
,,Well Worth a Visit,4.0,,"Cheap admission, great interactive audio guide, if your looking to learn about the history of Singapore this place is a must see, friendly staff and a amazing building with a lovely cafe.. Loved the experience"
,,"Seasonal activities for families, interactive displays",4.0,,"Good idea for weekend excursions with family, friday evenings like most museums is free entrance. Clean and comfortable enough to bring young children. Museum shop is underrated, you can find nice things to see and buy every now and then. Food outlets make for good weekend brunch experience with family."
,,Free fun for the kids,5.0,,"We visited with friends on a weekday to keep the kids occupied and were surprised at the lack of tourist visitors - which is a shame as the exhibits were very well thought out and our children aged 1 and 4 had a wonderful time. There is lots to explore on every level, don't forget the 4th floor!

Masak Masak is on until 3 August, so get there while you can!"
,,Detailed exhibits if Singapore's history,4.0,,"If you are really interested in the history of Singapore in great detail, this is the place to be. Otherwise, the better museum is the Asian Civilizations Museum. Enjoyable nonetheless."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,If you want to learn about/understand more of the history of Singapore this is a MUST see attraction. The museum itself is housed in a glorious building just oozing history. Highly recommend.
,,An excellent attraction packed full of historical presentations and interesting cultural galleries!,5.0,,"This is one of the most interesting and historically-packed attractions in SIngapore. It is a must-gos for history buffs or those interested in exploring the beginnings of the city. Reasonably priced too, costing only $10 Singapore Dollars per adults, students go only for $5.

The highlighting gallery is the permanent exhibition: History of Singapore. It takes you from the early ancient periods of the 1400s of Singapore's founding as Singapura by indigenous groups, along the colonial periods of the Dutch and British empires, going into the Japanese war period during WWII, before culminating in the post-war 1960s during Singapore's alliance with Malaysia. Included in the ticket price is a complimentary interactive, handheld audio guide (a tablet pre-loaded with a specially designed app). It is necessary to take one before entering the gallery, as it allows you to listen to recorded narrations about specific displays and sections, further detail on displayed artifacts or resources, and tune in to several presentations. This guide will further aid your experience, and enhance further understanding of several galleries, especially dialogues which 'literally' put you in the surrounding period along with detailed and dramatically-crafted dialogues of people who would be standing within the area and its associated era. There is even a 'children's tour', or child-oriented program included also with the device, for younger visitors who may be confused with the detailed commentaries, but can be briefed on more directly and simplistically on the highlights of each section.

Also on display are the Singapore 'Living' Galleries, exploring on various aspects of Singapore culture (Film and Dramatic Arts, Food, Photography, and Fashion). These are lesser-detailed exhibitions, but just as interesting and interactive. From viewing film archives of early Singaporean films, to learning about the history of Laksa and commonly-used spices in local cuisine, or viewing photographic records of Chinese migrants upon their arrival into Singapore, these are also worth a look at and are visually appealing as well.

The museum is easy to find, being adjacent to the National University of Singapore and conveniently located near both bus and MRT stops. (Bras Basah station is the one you want to get off at). You will be spending at least 2 hours going through the full exhibition from start to finish, following the guide, and that's before you count in the Living Galleries or basement monthly-rotated exhibitions. Children will easily find approrpriate 'play areas' around the museum as well, especially on the 2nd floor where there is a permanent 'Play @ NMS' exhibition designed for them. Gift shops and restaurants are also on-site as well, especially if you want to grab a refreshment after your long, tiring walk through the galleries!

Wether you're a local, expat, or tourist, the National Museum will surely delight and enrich you on the history of the city."
,,Recommended Visit to understand more about Singapore,5.0,,Beautiful Museum in a grand historical building. The museum has several spaces covering international exhibitions as well as very comprehensive exhibitions about Singapore from its progress to nature and culture. Really enjoyed the exhibition of the history of Singapore which showcased the different milestones in the development of Singapore from the hardship it has endured to it modern development and achievements. The museum is also conveniently situated in the historic district of Singapore and yet a short walk away to the modern shopping district of Orchard road. We were both pleasantly surprise by this visit and we were glad we made this trip to the museum and to walk away learning much more about singapore
,,Worth the $10,4.0,,Learned a lot about the history of Singapore and it's people. They also have very beautiful opera costumes and intricate puppets.
,,Well worth your time,4.0,,"I'm not typically a museum fan - but this one got me strolling around for hours.

The temporary (& free) exhibits on the basement floor were beautiful picture galleries - so we were lucky here.

The permanent exhibition ""Singapore History Gallery"" takes you trough Singapore's facinating story via 2 routes: the ""big events"" and the ""everyday life"". We followed a tour guide and went back to do it again with the audio-tour. Both included in your (only) 10sgd admission. (free for PR's and locals). Additionally, there are several galleries focussing on different aspects of the traditional S'pore lifestyle.

Especially when you're living in Singapore, this is a must visit!"
,,Well designed; worth a visit,5.0,,"Very accessible museum which provides a full overview of modern Singapore since its founding. The audio guide provided with admission is superb, offering both a general overview and a more ""personal"" viewpoint of individual citizens. Definitely go!"
,,A must do,5.0,,A brilliant attraction to learn about all things Singapore. I went on the recommendation of a friend and it was well worth a trip. Cheap to get in (parts are free after 5 or 6pm I think but it's worth paying) and you can easily spend a couple of hours here. It's also next to fort canning park which is nice to walk around and connects you between orchard road and Clarke quay. The audio guide in the main history section is excellent so make sure you get it (it's free).
,,"More seats, please!",3.0,,"Lovely buildings, and free guided tour once you pay the initial entrance fee, but I longed for somewhere to sit down in the historic galleries while listening to our informative guide. Or could visitors be offered one of those lightweight, fold-up stools to take round with us and return at the end?
Some 'different' stories upstairs in the photo record of Singaporean families... How life was for Japanese prostitutes, and polygamy on the island, for example.
Some interesting activities for children, which were free..."
,,Interesting!!!,4.0,,I enjoyed walking around this building because of the mixture of Colonial & Modern architecture...enjoyed the story of how Singapore was founded..my problem was the ipad guide i was given kept turning itself off..lol..especially halfway round!!!...i eventually had to leave after a couple of hours with still some more to view/see!
,,Great Looking Building,4.0,,"A very interesting photographic display by Sebastio Salgado showing in one of the Exhibition Galleries, worth a visit, but only showing until Aug.2014"
,,Must visit to understand Singapore,4.0,,"I visited the museum several times.
My favorite area is the history gallery. Well organized space with the iPad guide and the paths signaled on the floor.
Not so much enthusiast of the living galleries, to be visited, in my opinion, only if you still have time after the history gallery.
I was there also in occasion of interesting temporary exhibitions which are organized in a very nice area in the lower floor, unfortunately not very frequently.
I think it's an interesting visit for all, from singles to families with school age children. With the visit you can really appreciate the incredibly fast growth of Singapore."
,,Great afternoon,5.0,,We spent most of an afternoon to get out of the rain. The basement has rotating exhibits. The living galleries are informative and a great mix of interesting things to see. The singapore gallery need to use the headphones and pick and choose the things you are interested in. Make sure you leave time for the living galleries
,,"Very informative, good facilities",4.0,,"Obviously newly refurbished, the museum was the most interesting part of my trip to Singapore. It was very informative about Singaporean history and had great facilities. Normally at museums you have to pay to use the headsets but they gave them to us for free here and the information we received was excellent. Would definitely recommend for anyone who doesn't know anything about Singapore's history."
,,Interesting showcase,4.0,,"If you're interested in Art and Singapore culture/ environment, you should visit the National Museum of Singapore! Besides that, it is near Plaza Singapura if you want to shop after visiting the museum.

They have a variety of exhibitions this month. I visited for free.
One of my favorites is the Singapore Living Galleries- Food. This gallery showcases all the different types of food such as roti prata, chicken rice and the traditional utensils used to prepare these food. There's also specially made films about the origins of the food and how much these food meant to the older generation of Singapore. For food lovers, it would be highly relatable.

There's also a Wayang gallery and fashion gallery. Wayang gallery talks about the film industry in Singapore. The gallery also exhibitions short old films and beautiful vintage costumes. The Fashion gallery exhibits the fashion of women from 1950s to 1970s.

Oh there's also a special exhibitions for kids! try the Masak Masak & PLAY@NMS exhibitions. They are really fun for kids.

For more detailed descriptions of the exhibitions, try this website http://www.nationalmuseum.sg/NMSPortal/."
,,History of SINGAPORE,5.0,,"From this Museum, you can view and explore the whole History of SINGAPORE. Many various of antique displays from year 1928 onwards (ie clothings, weapons, etc). Its a GOOD interesting place to visit."
,,Interesting place worth visiting,3.0,,"Had a chance to revisit the museum after decades.

It is easily accessible by bus and mrt. Check out the various galleries, I believe there is something for everyone. If you are not interested in the exhibitions, you can take sometime to admire the historic building. It is so beautiful after restoration.

I will revisit someday, and spend more time at the various galleries (especially it is free admission for Singapore citizens)."
,,"We'll presented building, very interesting and diverse exhibits.",4.0,,"Visited this museum when transiting through city. Excellent and well kept building, with diverse and interesting exhibits relating to many areas of the country's history including culture, food, religion etc. We'll worth a visit if you have the time and want to learn more about this wonderful island :)"
,,Immaculate building; gorgeous architecture. Excellently curated. Something for everyone!,5.0,,"This is one of the most beautiful museums I've ever been too! Easily navigable and so much natural light throughout. Around the grounds are stunning views and lots of outdoor park areas.

When I visited, a few couples were getting their wedding/engagement photos taken here. Maybe it's the huge vaulted ceilings, the spiral staircases, and the marble foyers... I was nothing short of impressed. Most of the museum personnel were in perfectly tailored and pressed black suits.

Also, it's conveniently located next to Fort Canning Park, my all- time favorite area of Singapore. Visit them together (2-4 hours for both).

Singapore can be god- awful hot and humid, so walking around the museum offered a welcome respite from the tropical heat. There were exhibitions on the food of Southeast Asia also, which is awesome.

Lots of new technology like touchscreens and other inspiring ways to curate the information. There was also an exhibition on Fashion throughout the decade, and the Evolution of the Cheongsam.

A must- see in Singapore if you have a half- day. Walk around the museum and work off your lunch!"
,,Elegant public museum,4.0,,"Visited this museum with our Filipino friends who work in this city-state (they highly recommend this site). Such a pity we didn't able to check and appreciate everything inside with such a short remaining time. Though we had good insights on Singapore's history from our tour guide during our Duck tours, we would like to know more of it from here. Will re-visit this museum hopefully in our next Singapore trip."
,,Well worth it,5.0,,"The history of Singapore multi media exhibit is worth it. Beautifully displayed. Gives you the option of following historic events across the centuries or individual histories. Of course i did both!
Great interactive commentary.
The rest of the museum was also good but the history section took the cake.
In a wonderful old building. Great lunch options. Plenty of people watching options too."
,,"Skip permanent exhibitions, visit the temporary ones",3.0,,"The permanent exhibition(s) are of a little interest, you would better skip them to save your time. However, the museum hosts excellent temporary exhibitions."
,,A must place to understand Singapore history,5.0,,"My husband and I had 2 nights in Singapore before we heading to vietnam and although my husband and myself visited Singapore many times on business in the past, this was our first time spending our time as tourists. We choose to visit NMS as we thought there is no better place to understand history of Singapore in a short time that we have in Singapore and we weren't disappointed. We joined the 1 hour free tour guided tour that guided us chronological order from how singapore were discovered to how it became thr modern singapore. I would recommend this place for anyone visiting singapore."
,,Well Presented,5.0,,"One of the better museums I have visited with well set out displays to keep you interested. My partner particularly enjoyed the movie section as he was in Singapore in the 70's. I personally, being an older person, would have liked the odd seat to be dotted around as in The National Gallery in London for example. There is a photographic display currently showing in the basement and I got told off for sitting on the edge of some staging. It looked chunky to me but I had to accept their wishes. Recommend a visit if you are interested in the history of Singapore."
,,A great insight into Singapore's history,4.0,,"We greatly enjoyed the chartering of Singapore's history, in particular the audio tapes with extra information and the personal accounts including letters and such which give a better sense of history through the lenses of people living in that era than simply setting out facts.

The World War Two exhibition was particularly interesting as was the colonial history of the country and the struggles to breakaway from this.

The museum is a great insight into this country's colourful and very interesting history."
,,Lovely place if you have time,5.0,,Lovely place to visit when you have time. The building itself is very nice. We enjoyed the restaurants too.
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,"Unlike other museums which normally just have random pieces on display, the National Museum was well thought (and set) out!

It had either a factual account of Singapore's history, or a 'personal' account where they gave back stories on events in Singapore's history. This should be the first stop on anyone's visit to Singapore!"
,,mainly a gallery,3.0,,"I was expecting to find a museum setting out the history of the city.instead I found a gallery.whilst some of the displays,such as that on the native film industry we're quite good I was rather disinterested in displays about food.a rather odd layout means it takes a time to find everything"
,,Interesting,4.0,,This museum gives you a full history with a audio guide with options on how to go through the museum take your time with tour enjoy learning about this city state.
,,Take the guided tour if available,5.0,,Covers all aspects of Singapore's history. Take the free guided tour if available. This is provided by volunteers and is very informative.
,,Brief visit to the museum,4.0,,"We went to the National Museum because it was one of the public satellite locations for this year's Hair for Hope event which is in aid of the Children's Cancer Foundation.

As such, we did not take the time to check out the various interesting history that the museum provides but we love the huge and very spacious feel. But we managed to get some pictures...

Glad to know that the National Heritage Board had adopted the Children's Cancer Foundation as part of their social responsibility since 2013."
,,Extensive History of Singapore,4.0,,"A great way to know Singapore through its history. The History Gallery, included in the ticket, included an audio guide that allowed you to explore as much or as little as you liked. I spent 3 hours -- the battery died on the device and my feet were tired. Still enjoyable to those who want to know more about this unique area. Good activity for beating the heat or rain, as the a/c is comfortable."
,,Excellent and enjoyable museum,5.0,,This museum is so beautiful from the outside to the inside. We spent there for two hours with all interactive learnings which allow us to know Singaporean history. I really love this place and surely I will revisit it again.
,,A brilliant gateway to the history of Singapore,5.0,,"It was a state-of-art museum, in terms of technique employed and the way exhibition organised. The museum was literally telling story about Singapore. The audio guide lead guests through a journey of history. People not only might learn the history from main history events, but also might experience history from the view of ordinary people.

Apart from history exhibition, the museum hosted some culture related exhibitions which were excellent as well."
,,Interesting to visit but we only spent less than 1 hour,3.0,,"We went here last Sunday (27 April, 2014) after we visited Singapore Art Museum. We arrived at around 5:00pm at the Museum and the Staff gave us a free passes! Great! Museum is very well maintained and as usual they have a good ventilation. After the Souvenir Shop, you can find a some few old displays of a POS, old clothes, horse carousel, etc from the past - which you can find more in other Museums. And in the middle - the first Ford Car in Singapore. They have a Coffee Shop (Food for the Thought) on the left side. Next, we went down on the basement - you can find a picture galleries in Amazon (not related to Singapore) and we went inside the picture galleries which is the most interesting part for me - We Defining Singapore. After spending about 20 minutes here. I went up to check and I found out that it is just another Souvenir Shop. Before leaving the Museum, they have another gallery for Botanic Garden. After seeing few galleries, we concluded to leave the Museum. Honestly, there is nothing much to see here. Though, I am amazed how Singapore was transformed into a first world country from being a third world country in the past. The Building/Museum is huge but felt that most of the spaces were left empty and could improve more on the galleries. If it is free, I'll pay a visit again (hoping that they improve better) but if they will ask me to pay $10 - I will definitely skip this Museum."
,,A must see,5.0,,"We visited the National Museum of Singapore because it was raining and we were looking for something to do and we were very glad we did. The Museum is fantastically set up, very modern and interactive iPads come with the very reasonable admission price of $10 per adult. The ""Day in the life of Singapore"" was particularly good set up in with a number of projectors running on a round room, hard to explain but really impressive. There is a choice through most exhibits of taking the ""personal story"" path or the ""factual story"" path, both are excellent. We also had lunch at the caf√© which was very nice, good service and food. Highly recommend a visit to this Museum."
,,Well Done!,5.0,,Great museum that tells the whole story of Singapore from its humble beginnings in an interesting and interactive way while you walk through many galleries. Respect to the people of Singapore - well done!
,,Extremely informative,4.0,,"I found this museum extremely informative and interesting. There is the first section which gives you a lot of information, then a more slightly interactive section at the back.

I wouldn't say it was particularly child friendly, it really is focused on educating you about Singapore's past and how it has form, and it does that exceptionally well."
,,A hands-on time trip,5.0,,"The museum displays many aspects of life in Singapore past and present. It's not a stuffy collection of old exhibits but a hands-on experience of the different epochs of Singapore from traditional kampong life to women's fashion through the ages. At certain stops you can listen to recorded explanations which help to illuminate the exhibits. Different forms of media are used, too.
The combination of the historic and modern buildings provide the visitor with additional charm."
,,Worth to visit,3.0,,"This museum is a good way to show Singapore. Best place for you who has big curiosity about this country. With beautiful architecture, this museum building is very eyecatching and easy to reach. Inside you can get everything about Singapore. For you students from any country, there is student rate which is half of normal price."
,,"Signs, Signs this museum needs more SIGNS",4.0,,"The museum has excellent exhibits in varied media showcasing the history of Singapore. One big flaw is the lack of signs: although the museum provides audio self-tour devices, mine ran out of power and my wife's recording malfunctioned half way through the museum. At this point there were few or no signs on exhibits. The museum should add some signs on the exhibits."
,,last day activity,4.0,,went here on our last day in singapore and it was great the free audio tour about the history of Singapore was great and could be taken from an event or peoples perspective. Beautiful building. Would visit again as so much to take in.
,,Give yourself an afternoon for visit,5.0,,"The self guided tour is the best I've seen anywhere in the world. You are given a headset and touch pad screen and sent on your journey through Singapores history. It starts with a mesmerizing rotunda of moving images and sounds as you cross this space you are given a glimpse of modern singapore. From here you travel back to the very beginning of the country. All the way through the audio guide is your companion, there are easily recognisable numbers to know what to listen to next. The whole exhibition is full of set pieces and recreations, it isnt so much a display of artefacts from history but rather an experience of living in the history of the country.

There was so much to listen to an learn and see that the hours slipped by making me almost miss the F1 race i was in town for.

Put this top of any must-do list of singapore"
,,Excellent learning experience,5.0,,Totally worth a visit and do spend the money to go through there history section with the self guided tour. We learned so much. Excellent value. We took time to go through the free exhibits at the end of our visit. We ate breakfast first at the cafe which in our opinion was the best breakfast in terms of value for money and it was tasty. Good coffee in relation to our expectations. Very clean restrooms too.
,,Loads to see,4.0,,We tend to take our time but we spent hours here and could have spent longer. It definitely revealed things I never knew about Singapore. This is probably best for older children as the interactive elements are mostly audio commentary in the main section. Great caf√© with reasonably priced (for Singapore) food.
,,"Serving vested interests, with some history on the side.",1.0,,"As a Westerner/ foreigner, I was shocked how this museum tip-toed around huge historical events like the mass killing of ethnic Chinese men in Singapore during World War II. As if they were asking the Japanese embassy for approval?!

The fashion exhibit allocated space and created highlights that indicated the museum was proud about the dominance of Western fashion over traditional clothing after World War II.
A far more interesting development a decade later in fashion -- the government's policies to force men to keep short hair and avoid hippie fashion -- were minimized in a corner but at least they were displayed.

Overall, this museum is more about national pride and collective identity, not so much about history."
,,Direct window into the culture of Singapore,5.0,,"I went during the mixed heritage exhibition, showing the hundreds of different cultural backgrounds that make up the whole of Singaporeans, many amazing stories and perspectives on what it is like and what it means to be Singaporean. I personally had a realization on the importance of heritage while visint. An amazing and eye opening place to visit."
,,A good museum,4.0,,"Singapore National Museum is the kind of place you can imagine school children being led around by the nose. By that aside it serves not only a useful purpose domestically it is a great way for the visitor to get an overview of the city states history.

First thing you'll notice (apart from how lovely the air conditioning is) is the sense of space. Secondly is the way the place is nicely and neatly arranged. They've not festooned it with a million exhibits and in fact there are a couple of small halls available for passing exhibits as well. There are interactive options and the whole thing is set up so you can take as much or as little time as you please.

Not only is it tastefully put together there is also a small cafeteria and a well stocked gift shop. And by well stocked I don't mean full of random low rent tourist rubbish. There are nicely decorative items for sale and a range of books on a number of Singapore related themes.

I feel that the Images of Singapore attraction over on Sentosa Island is more the visual feast and probably the attraction you'd go if you weren't 'into' history rather than there but this is a good museum all up. Well worth the armchair historians time.

Last tip - check the option of buying a ticket that allows you entry into the Singapore Art Museum and the Peranakan Museum."
,,Wonderful artifacts,4.0,,Really enjoyed our visit here especially our tour with a volunteer guide who was so knowledgable. It is in a good location by the river and is located in a beautiful old building.
,,average,3.0,,I have only been to the Singapore Living Gallery's after 6pm what saved me the admission. But judging from what I have seen there it's not really worth to pay to get in. Apart from the Foodpart it was decent. Anyway the building itself has an gorgeous architecture. So make sure you walk pass!
,,"A must see, not least because of the building",5.0,,"A must see, the building and how it has been restored and combined new and old is fantastic. The historic tour with audio gives a good insight into the history of Singapore. It is done as a storytelling and one of the best I have seen. I can only recommend it, enjoy"
,,Fabulous Guided Tour.,4.0,,We opted for the daily 2pm guided tour on The History of Singapore. Our tour guide was Chrissie a volunteer guide originally from the UK. The hour long tour extended to 90 mins but our attention never waned. We discovered things about Singapore that we would never have picked up on our own. A very enjoyable afternoon and the guide deserves a 10 out of 10.
,,Amazing,5.0,,I went there a while ago and words can not express how good this museum is I would recommend that everyone see it we only got to spend half a day and went through the history gallery the amount of detail that is in the exhibitions is phenomenal. With the history gallery you get an audio pack which as you walk through the exhibition it explains everything and tells you individuals stories. It is defiantly something I would go and see again is I ever got the chance.
,,Not worth going out of way for,3.0,,I'm not really interested in history but have been to museums in other countries and enjoyed them. I found this one a bit drawn out. Audio tour was very long and only some parts were of interest to me. Very time consuming trying to find what I wanted to see. Maybe changi museum better?
,,Old and Modern,4.0,,"What a grand building very impressive from the outside and a good mix of old and modern on the inside.
Like others the audio tour ran out of battery power after a short while into the tour and had to go back to the start to get another player so system could do with an update.
Cafe on the ground floor was good and I thought well prices with huge portions
A good trip out"
,,Excellent although guided tour too long,5.0,,"This older part of the national museum was actually purpose built as a museum and officially opened by Queen Victoria in 1865. A few years ago, a new wing was added to the back and partially built into a hill to feature an extensive, highly interactive history exhibition. We opted to go with a volunteer guide through this section of the museum. He was retired and obviously enjoyed talking about the history of Singapore, from pre-colonial times and abandonment through colonial settlement, occupation, and finally independence. It was supposed to be a one-hour tour but ended up almost 100 minutes long. He was so excited about the history of the island, it was tough to leave despite our delayed lunch plans."
,,"Excellent Concept, Some maintenance issues",4.0,,"In Brief...

Good:
Immaculately clean
Excellent Fusion of Colonial and modern architecture
Excellent Disabled access
Very clever conceptual design of exhibits
Audio tour
Interactive exhibits
Restaurants
Shops

Bad:
Audio tour player ran out of battery power in about 4 minutes
Some interactive video displays were faulty

Its a very impressive building both the original colonial building and the modern construction at the back. The displays are very well thought out and give a comprehensive look at the history of Singapore from well before the colonial era.

The people of Singapore must be very sophisticated and well educated as their museum reflects an elite of very educated and well cultured society from early on though the Japanese invasion to the present day.

There is a good balance of interactive, video and displayed objects. There are three restaurants and all are pretty good (expensive)."
,,Another pleasant visit,4.0,,"Although this was my fourth visit to this museum, I hadn't been here since 2009 and was looking forward to my visit, more so too since my travel buddy hasn't been here. Getting here by train is convenient but do check the route on how to walk here from the station - it isn't very far.

The facade of the building looks every bit as beautiful as I remember it and it photographs so well. In fact, everything inside was as I remember it, not much changes really except in parts of the History Gallery but it was still an enjoyable visit. And, this time I'd managed to cover the entire History Gallery!

Admission fee is S$10 for adults but we were lucky as there were a few more free exhibitions going on around the building and even outside when we visited. There are cafes available if you want to grab a quick bite/drink though they look a tad pricey. The gift shops are tempting with lots of interesting items.

You can easily spend a good 2-3 hours here going from gallery to gallery checking out everything. Plus, no-flash photography is permitted and you'd probably spend some time snapping away too. Truth be told, I reckon, content-wise it's a tad flimsy but they get (my) top marks for presentation. One of the only things I didn't favour was that it was downright dark in areas!"
,,"Good, but could be better",4.0,,"Have to agree what many others have said earlier. Beautiful and huge building, but when you get inside I guess they had renovations going on(?) and there was lots of empty space. But overall worth of visit and especially their food region was interesting"
,,Underwhelmed,2.0,,"A very disappointing visit. We arrived with enthusiasm, expecting a lot, and receiving very little. The most interesting exhibitions were the food and clothing production. The building is huge but has so little in it. There is no atmosphere. I expected the sounds,sights and smells of Singapore. To be transported to the invasion of Singapore with the fear and panic. It was so bland. A pity as there is so much history to work with."
,,Great museum,5.0,,Why? It tells the story of Singapore and we had a fantastic guide. She really gave us a tale of the city. About the people and the story from way back and till today.
,,Amazing space,4.0,,"I'm not the type who would pick a museum as my first destination while on vacation. But my wife is, so I went along with it. I'm glad I did. It's a very large space. While it does seem a bit lacking in quantity, it does make it up through quality. The former will probably work itself out in time. Until then, I probably won't see myself going back. But that one visit was immensely enlightening. Anybody wanting to learn more about Singapore's history and culture owe it to themselves to take a look."
,,amuse if you what to learn about the history of Singapore,4.0,,"We only visited two of the exhibitions in the Museum , which is house in a beautiful old Colonial building with very minimalistic furnishings inside. The first exhibition was about the film and entertainment industry in this part of the world. It was interesting but not large. The exhibition we really enjoyed was the one on the history of Singapore especially as my husband's uncle had been a POW here during the WWII. The exhibition starts in 18919 and comes through to the modern day. You are given an interactive tablet to use as you walk around which is very nice as you can go at you own pace. The only downside is that the tablet's battery didn't last more than about 2 hours. Well worth a visit especially if it is a hot and steamy day!"
,,Great way to begin our visit,5.0,,I don't think you can appreciate what Singapore is today without a quick look at its recent past and how they have reinvented themselves. We got lucky and caught the 11 am guided tour which was excellent.
,,"Good idea, poor execution",2.0,,"After visiting many of Singapore's attractions we had high hopes for the museum. The building was huge, but empty! There was vast open spaces of nothing! Disappointed we went into the main exhibition and were given head phones and an electronic device. The exhibition was disjointed and often hard to follow and offered no written explanation for the item you were looking at. The audio was usually a voice pretending to be someone who would have used the item, but it often left you none the wiser as to what the item is or the history of it. The audio for each item/area was often long winded and hard to stay focused. We left with no real understanding of the history of Singapore. Simple written information was needed, and the audio should have been used to enhance the information, not the only information source. Great idea, but needs work!"
,,Excellent Variety of Exhibitions,5.0,,"We visited the NMS on 30.12.2013 and were pleasantly surprised by the variety and quality of the exhibitions. The museum was able to provide a good insight into the history of Singapore - doubtless a little bit too positive - and into the way the different religions and ethnicity have formed a country with a singular identity. A little bit too polished, but nevertheless a great way to spend an afternoon."
,,NMS,4.0,,"If you got extra time in the city and don't want to get sunburn, can go an visit the national museum of Singapore in the heart of city."
,,Interactive history tour,5.0,,"The audio guide presented at the entrance has almost the size of an I-Pad and provides you with a choice of pathways through the museum( e.g. a pathway based on personalities, another one on the timeline). At each stop you also have a choice of audio sources to listen to."
,,Visit during the Singapore Biennale 2013,4.0,,"Interestingly enough, think this is my first visit to the museum even though I am a local. lolx. I would suggest that an approx. timing of 4 hours be allocated to viewing if you are interested in the history of Singapore on top of other exhibits.
The life exhibits to my understanding close later than the history exhibits which closed at 6pm and we were then politely asked to leave as my friend and I were at the history exhibits. I would had done the history exhibits first instead of the life exhibits if I had known that.
Tickets cost $10 for locals for access for all exhibits during the Biennale 2013 which comprises of access to Singapore Art Museum, National Museum of Singapore and the Peranakan Museum.
The history exhibits are interesting and they are divided into a personal and history perspective. I didn't even reach past the fall of Singapore before I was asked to leave.
Theres a 50th anniversary of television showing but the artistes were all local so if you are a tourist, you can possibly give it a miss as it wouldn't be anything significant to you.
The funny thing about the map is that it shows a third floor so we went up there and saw that its just an access and the rest were either empty or offices. The map shouldn't include the 3rd if theres nothing in it."
,,Great Visit,5.0,,We had a brilliant visit to this museum. We found the history really interesting and the displays varied and interactive! We had a guide which we thought was really great as she really explained everyhting and gave a good overview. The actual building is beautiful.
,,Loved the Hawker exhibition,4.0,,"This is an awesome deal for S$10 since you also get admission to the Singapore Art Museum and the Peranakan Museum. Although I would still pay S$10 just to see this one museum alone.

There's a Hawker exhibition where they showcase how some of the popular Hawker dishes are made (char kway teow, laksa, bak kut teh etc). Also learnt quite a lot in the Singapore History exhibition. Spent so much time in there, by the time I was done I only had about 10% battery left! The numbers to the audio guide were confusing at times though, since they have the same number in multiple places on the floor.

The special exhibition with the nuclear factories was also interesting."
,,Very enjoyable afternoon,5.0,,"Spent a very nice afternoon here with my 12 year old daughter (I mention this to show that it isn't just for adults).
Started with some local art which was interesting and varied, however the Sinagapore history section with (included) audio tour was the highlight for both of us.
Very good value for money at SGD 10 for an adult which also included the Art Museum and the Peranakan Museum."
,,Not My First Choice....,3.0,,"This museum is just ok. Limited amounts of artifacts from ancient Singapore have survived in this wet climate. And as others have mentioned the technology used to direct you around is not all that well done. A far better experience can be had Asian Cultural Museum. The latter has more extensive displays, and ties together the various cultural heritages that comprise Singapore today. If you have time for both, then go. But if you can fit in only one, skip this place and head for the Asian Cultural Museum. Don't miss the docent led tours there, very we'll done."
,,Good history of Singapore,4.0,,"This would have rated five stars had the technology been better. The audio-visual guide was difficult to operate (both my wife and I had trouble with two separate units - touch screen not reacting, ear buds falling out of our ears, etc.) But the building itself is lovely, and the exhibits are informative and well organized. The history of Singapore is fascinating, and the museum tells it well. We didn't think the art was top drawer, but as a museum about Singapore this cannot be beaten."
,,Nice Architecture,4.0,,"Seriously, this building has high windows, huge staircases.. and the art was interesting (though I didnt get the chance to see all of it). Again, for taking pictures, this is a great spot."
,,A Must Do,5.0,,"Excellent, up to date pad and headphones takes you round the History of Singapore which had so much to look at and listen to that the 2 hours we had just whizzed by. Excellent cafes and restaurants as well"
,,I love this place,4.0,,"A beautiful building with easy access from lower Orchard Road. There are some ongoing displays of the 'life and times' of Singapore and Singaporeans, and they also have some temporary displays - at the moment they have one on the history of TV in Singapore. There is a great shop selling books about Singapore, and gift items, including bags, jewellery and history based items, for example Tiffin tins. It is a nice place to spend a few hours. Yes there is a fee for tourists."
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,"This museum is like very few others in that it uses tech to present the exhibits in an informative and entertaining way. The History Gallery starts with a 360 degree movie and then a journey through the 600 years of Singaporean history from the early settlers through to Raffles, then the Japanese invasion and on to the modern Singapore. The audio tour is provided free with the admission of $10. There are 2 streams of the tour - one of the events and the other told from personal accounts. There are other parts of the museum that are also interesting and there is a nice restaurant for lunch."
,,Get the guided tour!!,5.0,,"We initially went to the museum on a Friday and saw the free exhibit in the basement, which was a series of Singapore art. When I saw there was a guided tour, I decided to come back on Sunday and pay the $10 admission charge.

When we came back, they were celebrating something about TV, and there were MCs and dancers, which was really fun and interesting. Our $10 charge included admission to the Asian Civilisations and Peranakan Museum which I wish we would have had time to visit. I heard both of the other museums were worth a visit, and I was impressed that you could see all three museums for $10.

We met our guide in the lobby, and she was wonderful. Walking through the museum myself, I never would have noticed some of the artifacts. But our guide brought all of the exhibits to life. We learned about the history of Singapore, from the time of Raffles and the unkown Faruqahar to David Marshall and the riots with Malaysia. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone visiting the museum; the tour takes place on weekends... I believe at 3:30pm.

The museum was beautiful, and the exhibits were interesting. There was also an audiotour if you didn't want a guide."
,,very interactive and informative museum,5.0,,"It presents Singapore complex history in such an interesting, multimedia, interactive way that it makes it thoroughly enjoyable. We spend about 5 hours, and were not tired of it...Children have their own trail they can follow.
There are several sections, such as ethnic groups, foods ( with even some species you can smell), arts, etc..spread out over several floors."
,,Knowledgable,4.0,,"Take a short tour around the museum located in Raffles Road. You will know more about Singapore history, which makes me more admiring this island country. By taking advantage of high tech, the museum presents the history lively and conveniently. It is modern too and well cared. The exhibition is informative. I really enjoy the visit. Entrance fee is 10 SGD for an adult.
Recommended."
,,Extremely informative and educational,5.0,,"The museum is located in a very impressive looking building not far from Fort Canning Park. There are several galleries, as well as a bar, restaurants and retail shops. I did not have time to visit all of the galleries and instead spent my entire visit in the Singapore history gallery. This gallery provides a very well produced multimedia presentation of Singapore's history from the 14th century through to the present day. I particularly enjoyed the sections on the initial colonization by the British and the Japanese occupation during World War II. The latter contained some testimonials that were truly horrifying in their description of Japanese brutality during the occupation. Overall, I definitely recommend that you visit this museum."
,,Worth your time to visit - if free,3.0,,"This place is worth your time to visit, but I won't pay to visit.
The permanent galleries are free to locals, a small fee for foreign visitors.
The permanent galleries include the gallery at basement and at level 2. All others are not accessible unless you pay.
The free basement gallery is the art gallery of Singapore, this is no good, a lot of the art pieces are poorly drawn, but nevertheless put on display.
The free level 2 galleries are the Singapore Living Galleries and History Gallery.
The Living galleries include The Goh Seng Choo Gallery, Food, Fashion, Photography and Film gallery.
The history gallery, i'm not impressed, so some photos and I moved on.
This place is not wheelchair bound accessible."
,,"Good blend, great value",4.0,,"Having only 2 days in Singapore I wanted to learn about the history. The history section of the National Museum was very informative but engaging as well. The interactive recordings for each visitor mean that you can control the pace and items that you want to hear about. I also visited the photography and film galleries. I didn't expect to enjoy them much but did... all in all, a great range and very well priced."
,,Educational visit,4.0,,"National museum of Singapore is a very well looked after museum which teaches you a history & culture of Singapore. For an entry fee of $10, you have access to most of the displays & you'd need at least half day to really enjoy them all. We were particularly fascinated about how Singapore became a multicultural country & how it's progressed over time. There was video about an English lady who is married to a Singaporian man, who started a club for interracial couples, & her anguish and frustration as the society wasn't as kind to them as now back then. They give you a portable guide to take with you for free, and it's very helpful to understand many of the displays.
They also have a nice cafe to enjoy after a bit of a walk around. We had some snacks there & price was fairly reasonable too.
It's a nice short walk (less than 10 mins) from Dhoby Ghaut station if you are using MRT."
,,Modern and Educational,4.0,,The museum itself is well-maintanined and interesting. It showcases history of Singapore in an interactive way by utilising latest technology. Make sure to take the audio guide tour.
,,"Educational Museum ,worth a visit",4.0,,"We visited the National Museum of Singapore on 14 Oct 2014.Located at Stamford road , between the City Hall and Doby Ghaut MRT station ,near the SM University.
The building itself was an awesome colonial style.Some exhibition take place on the front of the museum.
Admission is 10 SGD for foreigner, to enter the History Gallery and free to the Living Gallery from 6-8 pm.
As we entered the museum , we were given a tablet , contains all the info of exhibits inside.We just input the numbers seen on the floor to the tablet ,then we can listen to infos through the earphone.Its free.As we go inside the Museum , we experienced the 360 degree theatre titled Singapore in 1 hour.
Educational artifacts ,infos can be seen ,and experienced.The history and the beginning of Singapore, can be viewed in another theatre.
Great history of Sir Stanford Raffles and William Farquhar and his collections of water paintings are displayed,
Its worthed to spend some time in this museum,as the exhibits were educational and superbly displayed.The staffs are very friendly and helpful.
After we spend 3 hours inside, we enter the souvenir shop, and saw 2 restos beside the shop.
This attraction earns our recommendation to be visited."
,,History Galleries are very interesting,4.0,,"We wanted some more information on Singapore's history so headed to the History Galleries. You get a tablet computer to listen to and follow around some interesting exhibits. We enjoyed it and would recommend a visit.

It cost SGD10 for adults and they gave me a student discount (SGD5) when I showed by Australian student card."
,,A walk through history,4.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore, located on Raffles Road, is a must-see for any history buff. The building is an amalgamation of Singapore's colonial past and present modernity. There are various galleries, including Film & Wayang Gallery, Fashion Gallery and the Singapore History Gallery. The History Gallery is especially fascinating as it tells the story of Ancient Temasek, right up to Singapore in the 70s. A tablet which serves as an audio guide is given to each visitor before entering the Gallery, and provides detailed explanation of each section and exhibit.

The entrance fee is SGD10 for foreigners. The fee includes access to almost all the major galleries. There are also two cafes (if I'm not mistaken) that serve some decent fare for the hungry visitor. The entire building is disabled-friendly, and the staff there is most helpful.

To get there, I got off at the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station and walked for around 5-7 minutes to reach the museum."
,,World Class Museum,5.0,,"The National Museum is superb, it is a great place to go and get a crash course in Singapore history. The first display ""a day in Singapore"" sets the tone for the rest of the Museum it is just a brilliantly designed and imaginative place to visit it is great. It is one of the best s$10.00 you will spend and the kids will love it."
,,Short Tour of Museum,3.0,,There was a section that only played old movies and if you are so inclined to enjoy them then I recommend watching a few It won't take a lot of time. What caught my eye was a display of old silks and carriages that immediately evoked a time when a British had a great on their culture. For me it was s os but My time in Singapore was linited
,,So much in one place!!!,5.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore is housed in a lovely old building; although once you‚Äôre past the entrance it has every mod con. After buying my ticket (very reasonably priced at Sing$10.00) I check out a temporary exhibition (when I visited in Jan 2013) for small businesses to market their products, some are practical like the lifelike food displays, others are quirky like huge furry purple ball with a tongue and mouth that‚Äôs actually a seat!!!
From there I move to the Living Galleries. These 4 different galleries look at film, photographic, food and clothing history. I particularly liked the fashion gallery. Seeing meters of beautiful fabrics hung from the walls and how ladies got around incorporating ‚Äúcurrent world fashion‚Äù with traditional fabrics, prints and styles, this showed their innovativeness. The food gallery houses all sorts of cooking implements, crockery, common herbs/spices and their descriptions for use, the baskets that were used to transport food and an original mobile kitchen/food stall. The photographic gallery tell some individual stories of the different ethnic groups through a photographic history. All the galleries were really informative and interesting. The one gallery that was lost for me was the film gallery; unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt translate what was happening. Three out of four isn‚Äôt bad.
Exiting from the Living Galleries I noticed the kinetic energy lamps swaying from the ceiling. Just watching them is quite meditative.....This leads to a lovely atrium space.
Its time to move on; following the curved ramp that joins the old and new buildings and leads to the Singapore History Gallery. The story starts with a stone that was found near the Singapore River; made from sandstone that‚Äôs engraved with an as yet un-deciphered script. In a round movie theatre the story of the coming of the British Colonialism is explained. From there the route takes you through different ethnic areas and alcoves, on to the fall of Singapore, Japanese occupation and eventually Japanese surrender and the building of a nation and independence. Singapore as a nation has much to be proud of; I think their pride is well displayed in this museum. I thoroughly enjoyed this museum and spent over 3 hours there but could have spent longer."
,,Really nice,5.0,,A very nice museum to know the whole history of Singapore.. A very lovely experience. . My husband loved it too
,,so much to take in,5.0,,we were surprised by the meatiness of the national museum's ongoing sxhibits. we had to leave long before we got as far as we wanted and would love to go back.
,,Interesting.......,4.0,,"learnt a lot about Singapore's history, which I didn't know. Well worth a visit and very reasonably priced entrance fee"
,,World class museum offering engaging displays- and interesting dining opportunities,5.0,,"This is Singapore's principal history museum.

Presently, they have a special exhibition: ""Princely Treasures of the House of Lichtenstein"".

This is an engaging art exhibition, featuring superb artwork treasures, including several magnificent Rubens works.

Besides the Museum, there are several interesting dining opportunities:

1. Food for Thought- tasty all day dining- try the Beef Rendang!

2. Flutes- upmarket dining, and daily traditional high tea.

Well worth a visit."
,,Rich in history,5.0,,"The museum has just finished some renovations at the main gallery. There are now more exhibits on Singapore's history during colonial and Japanese occupation. It was a real eye opener as it gave good historical background. Sometimes, the museum would also bring in exhibits from overseas, hence do keep a lookout. Overall, it was an excellent Exhibition. Would recommend to the locals and tourists."
,,Princely Treasures...,4.0,,"Went to see the building (the mix of old and new) and visited the Princely Treasures exhibition from Liechtenstein. World class collection of paintings; there was a room just containing Rubens and many of the old western masters were represented too - Raphael, Rembrandt, Frans Hals, the Brueghels, Van Dyck, Canaletto and other great painters. Well worth the SGD 10 ticket if you are into such art.

After seeing that temporary exhibition, we had tea at the cafe and proceeded upstairs to view the Living Galleries which were f.o.c. Liked the section on Chinese opera and puppets. Wanted to have a walk in Fort Canning park outside but it was already dark, so we went straight to Clarke Quay after the museum."
,,Great place. Not child friendly staff.,4.0,,"We decided to visit the place on a weekend with our 3 kids. Part of the attraction was that there was supposed to be an interactive tour of one of the exhibits for children. To our disappointment, the tour required tickets and was fully booked. Nevertheless we decided to visit the exhibit ourselves. It wasn't a large exhibit and the interactive tour was ongoing at the same time. The tour was surrounded by museum staff and there were anxious museum staff all around. The kids were repeatedly told not to come near the tour. But don't we have a right to view the exhibits as well? They were also told to not to touch the barriers, not run around and so on. I agree that it's considerate and good behavior but this was supposed to be a child friendly place. It's not."
,,A must visit!,5.0,,"Beautiful museum, full of history with a $10 entrance fee, amazing! At 11am and 2pm, you can even get a free English speaking guide which is a must. If you choose to do the audio, you would be amazed of the detail of the history of Singapore and the pushing around they had from the English and the Japanese. Fantastic!"
,,brilliant,5.0,,"The building itself is worth a look, however once inside stand in the dome and look up - if the sun is shining the stain glass windows capture the light and look incredibly colourful. Upstairs there are some interesting exhibits depicting Singapore fashion, food and film and theatre. The must see and highlight of the visit is the history of Singapore section, when offered take the free audio guide as without them you will miss most of the exhibition they have very little in the way of displayed written information. Take your time and allow at least an hour for this part alone."
,,Limited exhibits in a nice building,4.0,,"The layout's poor but it's a good place to walk around for half an hour. Not extensive enough or organised enough to give you much of a sense of Singapore's history. Protip: drop some acid before going into the panoptic film room and watch the rapid-fire images of Singapore while the soundtrack intones ""Singapore, Singapore"" over and over again."
,,Unique exhibits!,5.0,,"Being a hobbyist seamstress, I was thrilled to see so many references to Singapore's textile history throughout the neighborhoods. When I stepped into one of the living exhibits, my heart skipped a beat: every Singaporean style was on display, beautiful curated, from the iconic sarongs through the 1950s and to today.

This on top of the mind-blowing 360 movie entrance to the historic portion of the museum? I didn't have enough time to learn everything about everything in Singapore, so I will be back. The audio tour is a must.

I have to agree with another reviewer: this is the place for souvenirs!"
,,Get your souvenirs here,4.0,,"This is a great place for souvenirs. They have very creative memories made into interesting objects. SIngapore icons like the tear-off calendar all tells little stories.

The mainstay exhibits are not fantastic. Take a quick look, get a general idea. The special exhibits can be very enticing. Do take a look to see if the latest season is to your taste.

Food is great. Try to enjoy the afternoon there and bask in some sunlight. A charming relaxing experience."
,,Huge collection and worth for visit!,5.0,,"Very huge collection of artifacts and history items in this museum. Located nearby Orchard Road and City Hall, easy accessible using MRT. Its building is british colonial style and been conserved in very good condition. Entrance fee is SGD 10 for foreign adult, for foreign student, show your student card to enjoy discount ! Divided into both living galleries and history gallery, spend at least 3-4 hours to enjoy the collection entirely. They display the items using both visual and audio method, so just follow the footprints on the floor. Get a translator for easier understanding at the entrance into history gallery FOC. Nice and very helpful staffs ;)"
,,Not helpful for visitors who learn about Singapore from scratch,2.0,,"I have a serious problem with the presentation style of the museum. This is all for kids and teenagers who supplement school lessons with a museum visit. All the presentation is based around individual stories; when I attempt to learn country's history I want facts. Preferably in chronological order. It does not help that all these stories take up so much time on the audio guide that its charge does not last for the whole visit. There are interesting exhibits but the presentation makes it nearly impossible to get a coherent picture. I found the ""food gallery"" nearly the only informative part of the museum."
,,"Great museum, don't try to listen to everything",5.0,,"Despite the price to get in the museum it was very good. It was clean & tidy and very informative. Each person gets an audio guide which guides you through the museum. You can choose how much (or how little) you want to listen to which is good.

At the start of the tour we were listening to everything so by the end it was getting a little tiresome & we ended up skipping some parts which was a shame as the part about the war was at the end. My advice is to be selective from the start - we were there over 2 hours despite skipping some parts."
,,Very Interesting,4.0,,"Some of the rooms are not as interesting but the main exhibit about the history is fascinating and you get a personal tablet audio. Listen out for the Singapore song at the beginning, it will be in your head all day!"
,,This what I called Museum!,4.0,,"This a great museum, not boring as hell, have a great facilities. Every one has equipped by tablet that explain the history every segment. Worth to visit if you care about the history Singapore."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Good collection that showcases the people, the culture and the history of Singapore. Worth a visit. Many interesting items on display"
,,"I loved it, but my kids didn't.",3.0,,"The building is beautiful, with a cleverly added on glazed wing. We had head sets for the history of Singapore section. It was pretty slow going, with numerous options f what bits to follow. If you listened to it all, as I did just this one area can take 4 hours.

The kids who normally live museums, particularly with headsets, tuned out at the beginning with a very long winded movie about the early tribe fighting over the land. My boys usually love a good tight story, but it wasn't done in an engaging way. I actually got a bit fed up with it half way through.

It then centres on Raffles and Singapores British history where you chose between hearing 'personal stories' of people involved in the different section,o r getting an overview of the events.

We then went to the fashion and film sections. Sadly by the we were all a bit overloaded and jaded."
,,SUPERB MUSEUM IN BEAUTIFUL BUILDING,4.0,,"Visited yesterday this beautiful museum, which is very easily approached with the MRT (metro). We visited the permanent collections with a free guided tour. The guide was very good, giving us in one hour a brief history of Singapore, while showing us the remarkable pieces in the collection. Than we visited the new building which hosts the temporary exhibitions - now they have a nice presentation of the Lichtenstein collection. The museum had a special activity for painters and amateurs which painted portraits copying the paintings with the instruction of a beautiful lady teacher. We spent very pleasant time in the museum and I think it is mandatory to each visitor for the first time in Singapore."
,,The building itself is stunning!,4.0,,"Just looking outside at the building is worth a visit. Nice, simple museum to learn a little about the history of Singapore. Loved the old photos and stories."
,,Allow at least 3 hours,4.0,,I have visited this museum twice and enjoyed it very much. Learn about the history of Singapore. It is housed in a beautiful building. Allow at least 3 hours.
,,Only if history interests you...,3.0,,"Tells about growing multicultural ethnicity of Singapore.Too much walking is required,So pay early visits"
,,"Good audio guide for the history of Singapore section, average side attractions",4.0,,"At $10, for the routine exhibits, it's not too overpriced. The history of Singapore section is interesting and the audio guide is good, although make sure you get a fully charged one before you start as it won't last the entire distance otherwise. Allow a good 2 hours for this part. The other 5 exhibits are pretty average to be honest. There was an optional $10 extra to visit a basement exhibit, which I skipped."
,,great museum!,4.0,,"Visited this on my first day in Singapore, easy walk from Dhoby Ghaut MRT stop.
$10 entry fee covered the history exhibit, and 4 galleries of Singapore's cultural history. Provided with a tablet (the companion) to help guide me through Singapore's history, which was very helpful! Only downside was that it wasn't fully charged and about halfway through I had to start choosing what I really wanted to hear more about.
World class exhibits, I was impressed and will recommend it to others :)
Also worth combining this with the Peranakan Museum just a short walk around the corner"
,,"Great museum, good restaurant and gift shop too!",4.0,,"Wonderful way to spend half a day. Story of Singapore told in a very interesting way using tablets that let you personalize the level of detail you want to know. Restaurant was very good, don't miss the desserts! And the gift shop had nice things as well, in different price ranges. Restrooms were the only disappointment. Definitely recommend this, then a quick walk to the Peranakan museum to round out your day."
,,Superb thought has gone in to this place,4.0,,"A cheap $10 to access the Singapore history section and fantastic value for money. You are given a complimentary I-pad device at the start of the visit and this makes the visit extremely interactive although it does cut all connection with your party and the outside world! The museum is zoned off beautifully and is absolutely huge taking you on a journey from pre-Raffles onwards through the war and on to present day. If you really want to see everything you do need to spend a few hours here but if you clicked for information on the I-pad for every single item you would probably be here for a week! Perhaps there was a little too much to digest? We were exhausted after the 3rd hour and the battery packs were giving up so we called it quits, whizzed through the colourful modern era and headed off to Raffles hotel. A must do, however, and for a museum this has been very carefully planned to cater for today's audience. We really enjoyed the visit and glad we stopped off here. Good to do Raffles hotel after you have learnt all about him!"
,,Look out for the blockbuster exhibitions,4.0,,"I love the architecture of NSM, and regularly visit their blockbuster exhibitions. If you can, come during August when they are part of the Night Festival - they are open till 2.30am and there are always fantastic lighting projections on the museum facade or performances during that time. It's also a lovely way to spend half a day."
,,Terrific Museum,4.0,,Great way to get an overview of Singapore's history & culture. Multi-media and interactive. Centrally located and a good gift shop. Definitely recommend!
,,Depending on the exhibition,4.0,,"The National Museum is located in a beautiful building, and has some good permanent exhibitions about Singapore history, like clothes and food. It is also very easily accessible by public transport, located close to Dhoby Ghaut MRT.
Some exhibits are more interesting than others, but if you are lucky, it is a good space for a museum visit. The Cinematheque will occasionally have a screening.
The Museum Shop is worth a visit, but the stuff sold can be found in most of the Museum shops in Singapore, as they are not related to the museum or exhibition."
,,national musuem of singapore,4.0,,There is a lot of interesting history about Singapore especially for me as it brings back a lot of memories from the past. Foreigners may not really get the full story but it is still good enough for a half day trip inside the musuem
,,the national museum of singapore,5.0,,great monument and situated in the heart of the city. three levels of exhibits and all are worth seeing. must do on any visitor's agenda.
,,plain boring museum,2.0,,"there really isn't much to tell. It's definitely not something I would recommend for someone staying in Singapore for a couple of days. It's dark, lacking basic information boards (guess you would have to go around with one of those tablets to get any information) and there's anoying music everywhere!

you have to pay a small entry fee if you're not Singaporean."
,,Lots of options,5.0,,This is an interesting and informative museum. For the price of your ticket you get the use of an audio guide which also provides additional written info on each object of interest. I noticed that there was a series of spots of interest to children with numbers they could punch in. That would be a great help to parents.
,,Great telling on the History of Singapore,4.0,,Great information and thorough account of the history of Singapore. Lots of artifacts and tales on how Singapore ended up where it is today. Very interesting. Audio track was well done and allowed more in depth information on multiple subjects if desired. The order of audio track and the visual displays were a little out of synch but that just lead to more exploration of topics.
,,If you want to know all about Singapore...,5.0,,"Just go here! You'll lead by some 'guided pad' with earphone there. So you'll walk along the path and listening the story at the same time. History, culture and all the story from the source are all here. Really good documentation. So big, huge and rich of information you'll never know. You'll learn the war, the fashion from years to years, the beginning of opera.. etc..."
,,Good starting point to learn about Singapore,4.0,,"I visited this museum with my 7 yo child during Singapore school holiday when Singapore citizens/residents visited the museum for free. Normally, there is entrance fee. It is located within walking distance to 'Bras Basah' MRT station and opposite Cathedral of the Good Shepard on Stamford Road. We did not take the guided tour (available at specified times) as we wanted to stroll around freely. At the entrance, we were given 2 Audio Visual Guide (handheld multimedia device) - one for each person, for free. These were to be returned when we exit the museum. The floor of the museum are number-coded. Visitors can press the number shown on the floor on the audio visual guide to learn about the respective exhibit. The museum has History and Living galleries divided into sections.

The Singapore History Gallery is interesting for us. It tells story about how Singapore was formed presented in two paths: Events Path and Personal Path through big screens. Children can easily understand this section. Another section of this gallery highlights Singapore achievements since formation until present day.

Part of the History Gallery, The Goh Seng Choo Gallery displayed Collection of Natural History Drawings in watercolor, mainly on botanical and zoological discoveries in the Malay Peninsula. We thought this section a bit boring, maybe because we preferred more realistic exhibits rather than in paintings.

The Living Galleries have Film and 'Wayang' sections. The film section showed some of Singapore movies in the 60's (Malay, Chinese, Indian). The 'Wayang' section showed things like Chinese costume, hand puppets, etc for Chinese Opera performance. There were also many photograph of Singapore's early settlement.

Also part of Living Galleries, The Food Galleries was about Singapore food (our favorite section in the museum) and fashion. We learned about the origins & ingredients of Chicken Rice, Laksa, Roti Prata, Satay, etc through short video located near each food exhibit. The fashion section shows clothing styles of different races in Singapore in the 50's to 70's including the fabrics used, tailoring processes & techniques.

We had our lunch at 'Food for thought' restaurant inside the museum. I had crispy curry spice chicken which cost about $20. I think the portion and the taste were average for the price.

Before visiting, better to check the museum website as it has regular and special programs from time to time."
,,Stuck up (lady) salesperson at Banyan Tree souvenir store.,3.0,,"Didn't really feel welcomed. I didn't notice the sign ""do not touched"" because i was so amazed with the items on display. Nevertheless there is NO NEED to ""adjust"" the item right in front of me just because I've touched it, it was not even out of place. Call me sensitive but I am working in the customer service industry there is no need to act like that. Too free i guess or simply being snobbish working at an overpriced store."
,,Learn and wonder,5.0,,"This is a beautiful museum with a whale of a story to tell. The island state suffered a great deal in its history. The museum tells the story unflinchingly. The building is a work of art, the cafe is superb and I could have cleaned out the gift shop if I weren't concerned with getting everything into my suitcase. I hope all travelers to Singapore will find their way to this memorable place."
,,Great Museum,5.0,,"On arrival we were given the headset and from there we just wandered around and listened to the bits we were interested in. Much better than a guided tour. Well set out, interesting, clean museum with lots and lots to look at. Well worth 3 or 4 hours for only 10 Dollars."
,,One good exhibit and a lot of rubbish,3.0,,"The exhibit on the history of Singapore was great - very interesting, with a useful digital guide. The guide's a bit wordy, if you listened to everything it had you'd be there for many many hours. There's plenty on the history of the place, and the people. It's enough to keep you busy for a couple of hours, and it's well air conditioned - a must in such a hot country.

The other exhibits in the permanent collection are total rubbish, at least for foreigners. There's one about food, one about Singapore cinema, and something else I forget. None were worth visiting - we decided to take a taxi and wander around a mall instead.

When you leave call a taxi or ask the front desk to call you one, rather than trying the taxi queue nearby - it's on a quiet street and none came past."
,,Informative well laid out exhibits,4.0,,"An excellent story of Singapore and its history, the audio visual commentary was excellent and the museum gave an interesting perspective, the artefacts were varied and the stories were both personal and from the bigger picture. A well laid out journey through the turbulent history of this fascinating city."
,,"Awesome ""Princely Treasures""",4.0,,"Well-worth the $10 admission fee and time at this art exhibition. Wide range of collection, with paintings, tapestries, crafts, sculptures, etc. Vast range of themes too, from mythical to biblical, from portraits to landscapes, from still life to genre paintings, etc. Insightful and educational. But there are some rather dark pieces too, which may be quite uncomfortable. Great that the museum allows photography WITHOUT flash. Not advisable to bring young restless kids if one wants to enjoy and truly take in the exhibition."
,,One of the best Museum in the world,5.0,,"I am doing this review despite being a Singaporean. I have been to many museum in the world and I can let you know right now that the National Museum of Singapore is probably ranked up there with all the top flight museums in the world. I have visited this museum more than 5 times and every time I am there, I learn something new. This museum is highly interactive and you are given a personal handset guide ( feels more like your own personal guide) and it will explain to you the rich history of Singapore by just punching into your personal guide the reference guide code for each subject. This guide comes in a few languages ( Mandarin, Japanese, Malay etc). Please allow your self at least 2 - 3 hours to do any justice to your visit. This museum was built in 1870's and have been refurbished a few times and the most recent in 2005. Now this is my take as a local and a guy who have visited more than 5 times over the past 3 years. Of course, it will be boring if all you are interested in is shopping and eating. But if you are a history buff, then this is a place to visit"
,,History,4.0,,"Set in a lovely building, it's nice to be able to learn about the history of the country. A very informative day"
,,Well Done History Museum,5.0,,This museum was very nicely presented. The facility had just been renovated when I visited. The displays recount Singapore's past starting from pre-historic times but I found the displays describing its post-WWII history to be the most interesting. Singapore has had an interesting series of events in its recent past that have at various led it to be joined and then separated from Malaysia. Singapore politics have also been a bit intriguing as that drama has centered on the Lee family from the very beginning. Singapore in many ways has built itself into a model city during the latter half of the 20th century and now into the 21st century and this museum helps to appreciate how that has come about.
,,Average kind of Museum !!,3.0,,"One can find the history of Singapore. Their Food style, Fashion, Films all are depicted in the Museum. If you want to know how it got adopted then visit the place although I did not find it as good as I have thought so but once spent good half an hour or so in this.
The entry is free from 6 Pm to 8 Pm. it is 5 min walk from Dhoby Ghat MRT station."
,,Singapore history display - top flight,5.0,,"The special wing devoted to Singapore history is worth the time spent. I have visited several times of the years and there is enough information to enjoy it each time. The best part is the inclusion of lots of first hand historical sources so that you do not get the feeling it's just about the ""party line"" (although there's plenty of that during the PAP years of building Singapore in the 1960's). The entire wing covers all aspects of Singapore's unique history."
,,"Not easy to find, but don‚Äôt be put off from going",4.0,,"After a bit of a struggle to find the place - which should have been a breeze as Google Maps told me that it was only 650m from my hotel in Coleman St - I eventually located it across the road from the Sing Art Museum and near the intersection of Stamford Rd and Bencoolen St. Moral of the story: For pedestrians at least, it‚Äôs not well signposted, in fact it‚Äôs not signposted at all. So if you‚Äôre walking and don‚Äôt have a smartphone, check out the route beforehand.

I paid $S11 to enter, which included a ticket to see an exhibition of photography by a Sing ex-pat photographer, John Clang. At 11.00am, I joined a tour of the museum‚Äôs history gallery. Our French guide spoke perfect English and was friendly and knowledgeable. She would have had to be to cover about 600 years of Sing history in one hour. Nevertheless we seemed to get through the main highlights or lowlights as the case may be - such as the Japanese invasion and occupation and the post-independence split from Malaysia in the 60s. Highlight of course was independence in 1965 and the economic miracle that followed. I especially enjoyed watching the old newsreels that played on authentic 1960s TV sets and the vintage photos. It was all very interesting and smartly presented in an easy to follow and understand way, just what you would expect from Singapore.

The museum is in two parts separated by a short footbridge (which our guide told us was to get around some or other regulation about new buildings not being allowed to be too close too old ones). The new wing was completed in 2006. The old wing; the one usually featured on postcards and promos, is a beautiful colonial building in the English neo-classical style. Opened in 1897, the year of good Queen Vic‚Äôs silver jubilee (Sing was still a Brit colony back then), its dome features 60 coloured glass panels: one for ea yr of her reign. The new wing is stark and modernistic as one would expect with long corridors and sleek, shiny tiled floors and walls, everything interconnected with an escalator but lacking that warmth, intimacy and sense of colonial history, of the older part.

The museum has the usual cafe and little gift shop, but I didn‚Äôt bother much with them and after my visit, I scooted across busy Stamford Rd to the ground floor food court at the Manulife Centre for a tasty stir fried lunch.

History buffs shouldn‚Äôt miss this one."
,,poorly signed and hard to find,4.0,,We took a very informative tour with a museum volunteer (free). We walked to the museum and found it poorly signed and hard to find.
,,A little bit of new and old,4.0,,"The National Museum is a great place to start with to know a country. I like how the museum is simple in its exhibits. The main galleries are divided into the Living Galleries and History Gallery. The Living Galleries as the name suggests; features food, arts, fashion and entertainment of how Singaporeans live. It's an exciting venue for adults to bring their young to learn about how Singapore used to be like in the past. I like the Food exhibits as it showcases the different type of food from different ethnic groups used to be sold.

The History Gallery is great, as it has a digital companion (tablet) which helps you navigate across the vast number of exhibits, from the founding of Singapura to the British colonial rule, the World War (II), Independence Day and so on. I benefited a lot from revisiting the exhibits and rediscovering Singapore's history.

Photography is allowed, but flash photography is restricted, some of the exhibits are quite dark; so you might be limited to your photoshoot.

The museum is very accessible, served well by public transport such as buses and the MRT. About 10 minutes walk to Dhoby Ghaut Station or Bras Basah Station (Circle Line)."
,,A must visit to understand Singapore's history,5.0,,The history gallery is a pretty cool exhibit to visit (whether you are an overseas visitor or local). The audio visual displays do make learning history (boring to some) interesting. Kids friendly too!
,,Not as interactive as the museums overseas,3.0,,"One thing we travel to Australia for is the museums that they have, no matter which state you head out to, the museums are never a disappointment. We have been to the National Museum of Singapore a couple of times and found it boring, other than the occasional temporary exhibits that had been organised, which is very sad as we have young kids (aged 4 and 9) and as a family (ok, this is going to sound like we are a nerdy family, but we are so NOT!) we wish there are great museums locally! We can't afford to travel a few times a year just to visit museums elsewhere! I was chatting with a colleague who used to work in the local museums and asking why we do not have more interesting exhibits, and the response was, the concern with vandalism or damage to relics and exhibits. Seriously, I would point tourists in Singapore to other museums such as the Asian Civilisation Museum or the Changi Museum, not the National Museum. I'm sure there are better museums in your own country ."
,,Pleasant surprised,4.0,,"When I came to Singapore I was sad because the majority of food, temples, and sights had nothing to do with Singapore history.

While the museum is small it definitely gives a comprehensive background on the country and its people. I think they did a great job!"
,,Love the activities for children,4.0,,"We were there for the annual museum Children's Season and had a lot of fun! The guides were patient, the activities such as story telling, craft and roving actors, were highly entertaining."
,,What a Waste of Space,1.0,,"Most of the exhibition rooms were closed, the Singapore History Gallery is poorly lit and without a guide or tablet little sense can be made of the items viewed, we found it impossible to get any ""feel"" for the Gallery, when coming down the ramp ....around and around with nothing to see, the link from the video start to the gallery is lost.
Strange place ?"
,,Pleasantly surprised,4.0,,"I've not been to the National Museum since I was a child. It has indeed come a long way. It's ingenious how they built the new, modern wing and hid it from view. So, when you look and the museum from the front, you can only see the old, historic museum building ...

My family visited both the Living & History galleries. Both were brilliantly designed and well-maintained. The visitors to the History gallery were each issued with an audio guide (something like a scaled-down version of iPad Mini), which you can use to tour the gallery at your own pace. If you're into history & culture, this is definitely the place for you.

If you're a local, the entrance fee is waived (at least for the next 5 years, according to the person at the counter). Just remember to show your ID and get a ticket at the counter near the entrance before proceeding to History gallery at the back of the building. We missed the counter and had to walk back to get our tickets :)"
,,An excellent introduction to Singapore,5.0,,"Museums aren't everyone's favourite pastime, but I'm a bit of a museum junky and I like to learn about the places I visit. I spent the best part of the day here, mostly in the Singapore History Gallery. Visitors are given an audio guide and once I had figured out how to use it (it's not that hard, I'm just not that tech minded), I found it was easy to operate and incredibly informative. There are two paths through the history gallery - one takes you through Singapore's political history and the other through the island's social history. There are lots of interesting stories which relate well to the objects, pictures and short films on display - I found it very absorbing. But even if you don't want to see and/or listen to everything, it's quite possible to be selective about what you look at and listen to and still get a good sense of Singapore's history and society.
With what energy was left to me by mid -afternoon, I also went around the food and fashion sections of Singapore's Living Galleries - also very interesting.
The Museum is located in an attractive colonial building with the history gallery in a sympathetic modern extension behind the main building. A short distance to the left of the
main entrance is an entry point to Fort Canning Park, an area of great significance in Singapore's history and a very pleasant place for a walk. But that was another day."
,,So Singapura!,5.0,,"Impressive history! Considering everything Singapore does not have when it comes to natural resources, one cannot help but be in awe of how far it has come as a nation of multiple ethnicity and religious beliefs. The National Museum certainly offers a crash course, and more, on Singapore's history. It is certainly a place to visit for first-time visitors to SG and a place to revisit for returnees like us. The place is well-kept, well-maintained, and orderly. But of course, this is Singapore, after all :-)"
,,Good time filler,4.0,,"Interesting museum to visit. Lots of various exhibitions, accompanied by an audio guide for he main exhibition (at no extra cost). Good for learning about Singapore's history"
,,Very modern but informative,4.0,,"I love how this museum presented Singaporean culture and society in a very techy way. We went there last summer (July 2012) and had not booked a tour guide but an audio guide instead since we wanted to go in our own pace. The audio guide was very well coordinated with the rooms you're going into explaining every details. The place looks so average from the outside but it took me and my family about 3+ hours roaming the ground floor and the first floor.

The place is very spacious and clean and of course very modern (hey its Singapore).

Over all it was a very informative and nice experience."
,,"Majestic Look at Night, Museum exhibition detailed and comprehensive",5.0,,"1) Perfect Photography Spot
Excellent photo spots for Photography fans who loves architecture and heritage, be it during daytime or night time.
For those who want to take night photos of the building, note that its lights are usually turned by the time of sunset, definitely on by 8pm. Its lighting is simply wonderful compared with most other heritage buildings in Singapore
One could easily take a perfect shot with the romantic Lighting plus the light trails of cars passing in front of the museum.

2) Exhibition itself
the exhibtion about Singapore's history look a bit boring at first when you view the video of Singapore in the circular hall, but as you step into the main exhibiton hall, the story of Singapore's 700 years history unfolds gradually in front of you. I appreciate their idea to present their history through the ""textbook"" perspective plus the perspective of ordinary Singaporeans living in that particular period. Could easily take up half a day if you view the exhibition in depth.

For tourists who are students/ undergraduate, present your student card and enjoy free admission, haha"
,,"Worth the visit, but...",3.0,,"The display galleries are pretty much waste of time unless you are very interested in one of the subjects: fashion, food, film or photography(closed). Then again visiting them takes only few minutes each.

The history part is very informative and interesting, but the Ipad thing just does not work. I had queue to get an Ipad for about 25minutes and the first one froze before I could get past the first room. After getting a new one from the end of exhibit (and walking back) I had pretty good time going through the displays. Too bad you have to choose between two different displays (or go back every now and then). I spent about 3 hours there and listened most of the audio...there is amazing amount of extra information available if you are up to it. I had to change the Ipad second time since it ran out of battery before I could finish.

The museum could be one of the best in world, but lets face it: This just does not work. Ipad is hard to use and it feels kinda wrong just standing there and waiting the audio to finish (most of the audio is way too long). Menus are rather hard to use and I felt bad for all the seniors who clearly could not enjoy the museum at all.

Maybe in ten years this will work...but not it is actually making the experience worse.."
,,well worth a visit,4.0,,"There are some interesting and beautiful displays of Fashion, Film, Food, Photography and local history. There is also a very interesting history section using photos and displays of the fall of Singapore to the Japanese during WWII. you won't spend hours here but well worth visiting."
,,Mind blowing,5.0,,"I am bit an avid museum attendee however found myself so spell bound here. This museum had a 2 or so year re fit out a couple of years back and it shows. Is state of the art. The war history brilliant and the layout and experience kept me amazed for hours, I planned on about an hour or two and stayed five."
,,Too High Tech,1.0,,"This museum is a great place. I encountered the officiousness that seems too persavive amonst the new immigrants to Singapore. I wasn't allowed to move through until the lady handing out the interactive handsets had finished with her group. The guy just monstered over me as iff I was going to walk through anyway, probably because others have because of the silliness of this rule.
That aside the interactive hand set was a bit of a joke. Why they needed to reinvent the way a museum works I don't know because the handset was just foollishness gone mad.
The museum was great and looked very interesting but the laziness of not putting signs up explaining the exhibits spoilt it all."
,,Where history meets technology,5.0,,"I really liked the way early to enter the museum, a large oval room and full screen, which displays a video of the daily local community, with good background music. They want to make all our senses also feel the history that has occurred. All prologue, dialogue, video, background music, the lighting is very well organized and synchronized."
,,BELOW AVERAGE.,2.0,,Very average museum and very few things to see and only good thing is that its very near to MRT. There is not much to see BELOW AVERAGE.
,,Not Recommended,1.0,,"There was nothing to see except some arts, waste of time and money. Doesn't worth 10$ . A dark room and some spot of light really couldn't understand what that was.. also i asked the volunteer there and they don't know why it was like that too."
,,A thoroughly modern museum,5.0,,"The museum tells the story of Singapore using multimedia in a most captivating way. You are offered a choice of 2 routes - a people's perspective or one based on events. I chose events but want to go back and take the other route. My only regret was that my AV pack ran of batteries just before the end and I didn't have time to get another pack and finish the tour. It's a good excuse to go back. If ou have an interest in history, you could happily spend the better part of a day at the museum."
,,Interesting and high tech but not perfect,4.0,,"This is an interesting museum, with some nice features. As others have said it seems to be in 2 buildings, joined by an atrium. The older colonial style building includes 4 main galleries. One is a collection of Natural History watercolurs. They are apparently of major significance but unless you have a real interest in pictures of birds and audio tracks of their songs that gallery, which is small, won't take you long.The Food Gallery was closed when we visited. The 3rd gallery was Malaysian cinema and Chinese opera. There were some nice features but again this was of a very specilized nature. The final gallery was Fashion andthe role of women. Again pretty specialized but perhaps a little more accessible to a larger audience. The headphones with recordings of Singapore pop groups of the past was fun though.

The main museum, however, is in the newer gallery and really is a museum of the history of Singapore. It is unique in that each visitor receives an Ipad with audio descriptions of the artefacts, recordings of characters describing events etc. You also have a choice of pathways focussed on different aspects of the same displays. It was moderately easy to navigate but to be honest some of the audio features took forever. to play through If you are at all confused by technology you will hate it. For example my wife who has an I- phone and uses computers at work had real problems trying to find the right soundtrack for each display.

The features on World War II, the Communist Emergency and the early days of independence were fascinating but there again I'm a history buff. My wife took the more personal pathway but she felt it took too long.

My biggest disappointment was that my Ipad lost all power when I was only 2/3 ofthe way around. By the time I walked to the end and found my wife waiting for me we decided to leave."
,,Fantastic museum,4.0,,Fantastic museum. Get the audio tour - fantastic oral history of Singapore. The building architecture with fusion of old colonial style building at the front and modern building behind
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Housed in a stunning colonial building this is Singapore's oldest museum but certainly it has a young face. Some excellent exhibits as well as an interactive history of Singapore the museum is well laid out and one can easily spend a couple of hours here learning about Singapore and its people. At S$11 a ticket certainly this is a worthwhile stop on any tour around the city.
,,Great Museum for an Overview of Singapore,4.0,,While this isn't a huge museum it is very nicely presented with lots of great information about the formation of Singapore and how it has progressed since then. We found the whole things really interesting and took our time to walk around the whole thing. If you are really interested in the exhibits it will take you a couple of hours to get through the whole thing. The food and fashion areas were really interesting glimpses into a very relatable part of Singapores history and somehow really gives you a more intimate glimpse into the history and the mix of people that make up their population. The day in the life of Singapore movie is outstanding and really beautifully presented in the round theatre.
,,Nice but small museum,3.0,,"Singapore is quite a young country so its history doesn't have much to tell compared to France, which has Louvre. Modern and clean, still the museum gives you a nostalgic feeling to indulge in a gone past. The museum is located in the city centre, just opposite one of Singapore public university. You may have to walk for a distance from the train station (if you're taking one) to the place but it is a pleasant journey.

Inside the museum there are basically two sections: 1 is free and the other one is chargeable with earset to guide you through the detailed history. The exhibits are arranged in timeline, from the old time of an uninhabited island through the colony time to the modern time. Like many other museum, there are various artifacts and items displayed (thankfully with English description) so you may want to spend some time wandering inside.

Apart from National Museum you can try visiting other (more focused and specific) museums including Art Museum (a few steps away), Peranakan or Chinese museums."
,,Beatiful Museum,4.0,,The museum was beautifully designed and is house of many varieties of Singapore culture. The National Museum of Singapore is housed in an imposing Colonial building which is quite a fitting location as lot of the material it contains relate to Singapore's colonial past
,,museum worthy of high praises !,5.0,,This was a fantastic museum which was on International standards. You get a tablet to guide you around and kids gets a different version to guide you around. It's a must visit.
,,Best in class,5.0,,"The core museum here tells the story of Singapore through the centuries and it is very well done indeed. The exhibits are arranged in timelines; you can select the way you look at them and (this is Singapore after all) the interactive stuff works and works well. We particularly liked the post-war section which makes it comparatively easy to follow the various iterations of the modern state and its relationship to its neighbours, as well as showing extracts some of LKY's early speeches and putting them in the context of the time.

There are usually some interesting temporary exhibitions in the other halls, a good gift shop and a decent cafe: it's also a good place to drop your shopped-out visitors for a few hours off!"
,,"Must see, must visit Museum",3.0,,"Lots of collections, but in general, if you want to know more about Singapore, have to visit more museums in Singapore, e.g : ACM, Peranakan, etc. Nice ambiance, cool aircon.
Love it, while there was BBB flea market, opened just around Easter's weekend.
Very strict and harsh security staffs, my husband got warning from one of the security staff just for taking out his tripod to take pictures, whereas we were not in special display room which taking picture is not allowed."
,,Opened our eyes,5.0,,This was my favourite museum in Singapore. The audio visual and static displays are highly informative and very well laid out. The personal hand held audio guide system is easy to follow and provides great support to the visual displays. Way finding is easy with AV cues marked on the floor. Information is provided through the eyes of individuals who have featured in Singapore's development as well as detailed history of the major events that have shaped modern Singapore. Could easily have spent a full day in this very interesting place.
,,Quirky restaurant,4.0,,"found a fun little restaurant in here. decent food for a decent price. quirky decor and a menu with enough variety. the lamb was good, fries were very well done, drinks lists offered some good wines. salmon carpaccio were so so, got a bit confused with the location."
,,Good collection,4.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore is oldest among six museums in Singapore. It is a National Monument presenting permanent exhibitions on Singapore history and popular culture. Also they present exhibitions on world history. This largest and most modern museum shows history of Singapore through most modern multimedia technology.
In permanent galleries you will see their national treasures, such as the mystery-shrouded Singapore Stone and 14th century gold ornaments unearthed from nearby Fort Canning Hill. The visitors will also learn about Singapore‚Äô s multi-racial and multi-religious society, and its popular culture. Photography is not allowed in the museum.
There are special exhibition galleries showing world heritage and cultures here in Singapore. Museum is situated at 93 Stamford Road ,Tel:(+65) 6332 3659 / (+65) 6332 5642;. It opens from 10 am to 6 pm daily with entry fee of S$10. From 6 pm to 8 pm admission is free. you can enjoy unlimited access to their 6 museums by purchasing a 3-Day Museum Pass in S$20. One can reach here by Bus , MRT, or taxi. Own car or Bike will have problem of parking in limited parking space."
,,Excellent Tourist Attraction,5.0,,This was the first tourist attraction that I visited since arriving in Singapore. This is an excellent place to start off on. It is very interesting. You can take as long or as little time as you want. They give you a computer to listen to while you walk round. You get to choose what you want to listen to. It is 10$ to get in. It is open from 10am to 8pm. I walked to the museum and it was very easy to find. This is also close to the Canning Park which you can see all in one day. Then you could move onto the River Boat Ride.
,,National Museum of Singapore - Probably one of the better museums we have in SE Asia,5.0,,"This is our favorite museum in Singapore, offering a very good historical account of this city-state. Galleries are informative and bring Singapore's past and present to life in coherent and logical manner. Displays are diverse, interesting and presented in entertaining ways, making this a museum that even children won't mind spending time in. In our view, few museums in Asia are able to provide the quality experience found here, making the National Museum of Singapore well worth consideration for those planning to visit the city.

The museum is split into two main parts, the Singapore Living Galleries (free to visit) and the Singapore History Gallery (SG$10 per adult) and there are temporary exhibitions that can be seen as well for a small additional payment.

Singapore Living Galleries
Within the Living Galleries we greatly enjoy the Food Room, which features a bit of history around the various local food specialities and how they have traditionally been served over the years. The hawker and food stall histories are particularly interesting and the audio/video shows are worth your time. We also greatly enjoyed the Cinema history room featuring the Singapore movie industry, films and music through the years.

However, the real star of the Living Galleries is the Goh Seng Choo Gallery -where many of William Farquhar's original drawings of the animals, plant life and flowers, encountered during early visits (1819) are on display for all to see. This is an real treasure, not only for ecologists but for anyone interested in seeing what flora and fauna early explorers and colonial settlers would have seen here when they first arrived two centuries ago, before the days of modern civilisation and technology (digital cameras). Some of the drawings, many of animals which are now extinct, are very interesting to look at. This is just a very special collection well worth investing a bit of time in.

Singapore History Gallery
Similar to the Living Galleries, its difficult to not be impressed with your experience here. Upon entry you are given an audio-visual devise and instructions for how to make your way through the gallery. The gallery is split into two different paths, an Events path and a Personal path, which both take visitors through Singapore's history from two different perspectives. There are a couple of juncture points where you can switch and try the alternative path if you like. This is a creative and innovative approach to providing historical accounts, which we very much enjoyed.

Unfortunately, both of our audio-visual guides ran out of batteries during our visit and it was difficult finding museum staff to assist. We had to walk some distance to the end of the galleries and simply switch to new devises that were fully charged. This is a minor complaint we have for the experience here. However, in the end, it didn't matter that much. We were still very happy with our time in the History Gallery.

In the end, we left the National Museum of Singapore very impressed with our experience. We felt we had learned much more about its past and deeper appreciation for its modern day society. The manner in which the museum galleries were laid out and information delivered also made this an enjoyable place to visit as well, one which we offer high recommendation for visiting to those planning to spend time in Singapore."
,,Great museum to visit,5.0,,"The museum was beautifully designed and is house of many varieties of Singapore culture.
The explanation put on display was well written and the display was well maintained.
The strategic location of the museum makes it impossible to miss.
You pay the entrance fee but believe me it's worth it.
Great place to spend your afternoon with friends or loved one."
,,Great & worth a visit,4.0,,"My husband & I set out for the museum because we have recently moved to Singapore & did not know much about its history.

The ticket price is very reasonable & the staff very helpful, follow their recommendations on which gallery to start with.

The history gallery was by far the best as they give you a tablet & ear phones & while you walk around there is audio explaining the history. This audio is quite extensive, so make sure you are not hungry & give yourself a good few hours for just the history gallery.

I really liked the gallery on Singapore food as well as it had the history on each of the dishes & why they are named the way they are.

There are a couple of options for food & we went to the place near the ticket office which had really great sandwiches."
,,Interactive,5.0,,"The experience is great because they provide a device which aids you along your journey inside the museum. It's only you and the device inside. Although some parts are dark, you'll never get lost because of the device and the different markings on the floor. Surely, this museum doesn't need a guide."
,,well designed,4.0,,"Take aside the historical building with its antiq beauty. The museum is very well structured and designed. Eveyone knows that Sg is a young country, the history of the country is not very long. However, visitors are still attracted by the way they arranged things and by the high technology applied in services."
,,"Interesting, informative and in a beautiful building.",4.0,,"One of the wonderful things about Singapore is the colonial architecture, and the National Museum is a corker of an example of that. It's refreshing just to walk into it, with its high ceilings, bright white walls and airy, open spaces. The exhibits in the main building are kind of sparse but interesting, and we particularly liked the Film and Wayang exhibition. But the real heart of this museum is the extensive, intricate and captivating Singapore History exhibition in the newer annex. You get to choose one of two paths - Personal or Events - as you trace the history of Singapore, and we chose Personal. The only shame is we didn't have time to go and take the Events path as well. The artefacts on display are fascinating pieces of history and the stories they tell are well told, although the voice over on the complimentary headsets does get a little cloying on occasion.

If you're looking to get a grasp on where this city/state came from, and live through its sometimes harrowing history, you must see this museum."
,,Artifacts are well-protected,4.0,,"There are great things to see, including the gallery for Singapore's food, photographs, fashion, etc."
,,"Great history, good way to spend a few hrs",4.0,,"I was here on my own and loved walking around and looking at everything. The tours are fantastic, the place is interactive even otherwise.
Do remember to take your boarding pass with you if you have flown singapore airlines as you can avail a discount when buying the ticket.
This is a great museum to learn and understand the history and influences of different cultures in singapore. I loved my visit and do try their restaurant.Great Caesar salad and amazing lavender iced tea.
Great little souvenirs too. Enjoy."
,,Great interactivity,5.0,,"Fantastic museum. Get the audio tour - fantastic oral history of Singapore. Very engaging and interactive. We went with the kids (10 and 12) and were thinking an hour would be enough... We were so engaged 4 hours later we had to drag ourselves out because of hunger, but we were still exploring. We've been back a few times since."
,,Modern and ancient,5.0,,"The building was magnificent, outside it looks like a old residence building but inside it was ultra modern. With the state of the Art technology. Walked around in awe how big it was. There were different kinds of exhibitions going on so I bought a ticket for all for a cheap price and walked around with my mouth open. It was definantly worthwhile to come and see how modern Singapore has been created. I really recommend everyone to go and visit the museum to get the Singaporean feeling."
,,Ultra Modern Museum in Beautiful Colonial Building,5.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore is housed in an imposing Colonial building which is quite a fitting location as lot of the material it contains relate to Singapore's colonial past.
The museum houses a main historical section, and also an area for visiting exhibitions.
The historical section of the museum documents the development of Singapore from its discovery right up to more modern times.
The layout of the displays and artefacts is split into two tracks and the visitor either takes the ""personal view"" through the stories of inhabitants or the ""time line"" events view of Singapore history.
The museum makes full use of modern interactive A.V facilities.
Visitors may use an interactive tablet with headset as they wonder around the displays. On the floor by each display is a reference number and when entered into the tablet a commentary is provided.
There is a large amount of interesting material in this museum, and if you want to take in the displays at a leisurely pace you need allocate a few hours.
A small gift shop is located inside the main entrance hall and a larger one is present inside the museum.
There is a charge of S$10 for entry, but this is well worth it."
,,Stop by -- even if you only have 90 minutes,5.0,,"You must stop by this museum -- one of the best I've been to anywhere. Entry for adults is S$10 with discounts for students, seniors, etc.

I had to squeeze my visit into 90 minutes as I failed to convince my friends to join me in the museum. While I could have spent much longer, I got a good tour in. There are some standing exhibits on food, clothing, etc. which are good and open later (8pm).

But the real star exhibit is the multimedia historical tour through Singapore's past up to today. Note this part of the museum closes at 6pm with last entry at 5pm. You walk among recreated and actual artifacts with excellent tablet-based audio guide and occassional video. Honestly one of the best exhibits I've seen anywhere -- had guests of all ages (and all levels of interest in history!) engaged and learning. They have three tracks: children's, event-based, and people-focused.

My thanks and congratulations to this museum and the curator(s) of this exhibit -- wow."
,,Not great,2.0,,"This museum assumes you have masses of time to spend - they give you an audio to go with the displays, and each piece of commentary is very long. There is no choice to read the information instead. It makes it hard to follow the simple chronology of the history of Singapore. I don't recommend unless you plan on spending a day here."
,,Wow,5.0,,Only had time to see the self guided tour of the history of Singapore. Don't underestimate the time you need to spend here. Everything is meticulously presented & so well documented. A real plus in my visit to Singapore.
,,Good stories great history but difficult to follow,3.0,,"Unfortunately for the 2 of us the audio visual companions both failed part way round. Without them it is totally impossible to understand what it's all about. For half the visit my wife was hooked up one ear to my companion and we had to keep in step all the way round do that we could both hear. Then my battery failed so that was that. It's good but very difficult to follow. Fortunately for me I had read one of the biographies of Sir Stamford Raffles so it meant more to me than my wife but exactly for the same reason I could not appreciate the whole story because my bit if kit failed. So, what can I say. Disappointed I suppose"
,,Collections with nice display,3.0,,"This museum has a grand design fa√ßade. It‚Äôs like an embassy building, all white with the details. The admission for an adult is S$10. From my perspective, this museum divided by 3 section. First section is at the back in 2nd floor, we have to take the escalator to reach this section. Second area is on the front (also in 2nd floor) and third is at lower ground. In the first section, every visitor will get a tablet which works as a tour guide. Each collection has numbers, so we can choose the number to hear specific information for every item in the collection. It is interesting and simplifying when the tool works. Mine is not working in the middle of my journey. This section tells us about Singapore history from time to time.

In the second section, there are 5 rooms with different category: Movie/Film, Photography, Fashion, Food, and Art Exhibition. In my opinion, the collection is not too rare, but the interior design of every room has amazed me. I like how they display every item.

The third section is on the lower ground. It‚Äôs a big hall which displays theater movies and manuscript.

Come here if you want to know more about Singapore history. It‚Äôs a nice museum but I wouldn‚Äôt go twice."
,,To know the history of Singapore,5.0,,"Great place to know the history of Singapore. I will recommend you to spent half a day here, as the time to time theme gallery can be really fun and interesting...."
,,Best place to Understand Singapore,4.0,,"Located inside a grand building, the museum takes you through the ancient times to the British time to WW II till its modern days. If you want to understand Singapore, it's culture and the reason what made Singapore what it is today; this place is a must visit.
They have tried to mimic the ambiance of different period for its various sections. Teh audio device provided at the entry makes it very easy to understand the things on display & the history behind each of them.
It will take a full day to go through the whole tour, be prepared to stand for long time."
,,photo exhibits and a little bit disorganize.,3.0,,"We were really impressed with the building architecture with fusion of old colonial style building at the front and modern building behind. The audio guide provided was really impressive and saved us a lots of trouble to find the explanation of the exhibit. But, it was quite a bit of a let down when most of the exhibits were either modern paintings or photos (very few historical artifacts). I could say that it looked like a cultural museum. In addition, poor signage and a bit of disorganize. We got lost a few times and had to turn back to follow the chronological order of the history. 10SGD was considered a bit expansive for me for just photos..."
,,So much to see!,5.0,,"I only visited a few of the exhibits, but what I saw was very well done and good for tourists from all over the world. I particularly liked the exhibit concerning the 700 years of Singapore history. They provide audio guides in several languages and allow you to choose if how you want to learn: personal accounts or through facts and dates. You can jump back and forth if you like.

All in all, highly impressed and I would go back to see more!"
,,If you have time you may try,3.0,,"What I found here was not very rare. I didn‚Äôt give enough time to go through each and every section, because I was not impressed with the collections at the start."
,,Worth it for the building alone.,5.0,,This was on our list of things-to-visit-maybe-if-we-have-time but on a really hot afternoon after wandering around Fort Canning Park we decided to head in for the air conditioning. As soon as we stepped in through the door I was seriously impressed by the architecture and how well the new and old parts of the museum mesh together. We wandered through the free exhibits which were amazingly well done. It definitely belonged on the must-visit list.
,,Nothing to see,1.0,,"There was really absolutely nothing to see. Very few exhibits, lots of empty space. Swinging chandeliers were the only interesting thing but then, they had nothing to do with history.

Fortunately I didn't take a foreign friend to see this museum. Would've been embarrassing... Images of Singapore in Sentosa is a million times better. Don't waste your time here."
,,A national treasure,5.0,,"What a great discovery! if you only have a couple of days (like us) to absorb the history of the colonial outpost of Singapora make time to fit in a visit. The audio guide is included in the entry fee so grab your headphones right at the start. Exhibits are well presented and even if you select to skip all the personal stories listening to a few adds an extra layer of understanding. If this is your first visit to the city the Food - Eating on the Street gallery makes sense of the gastronomic delights that await you - we enjoyed trying to spot some of the iconic dishes on menus having learnt about the myriad cultures that vie for your taste buds.

Speaking of food, if energy levels start to flag the museum's Novus restaurant does lovely coffee and (homemade) cakes. And as a bonus, if your carrier is Singapore Airlines your boarding pass entitles you to a discount off entry to the museum."
,,Very good. Even if we are not so good.,4.0,,"The National Musuem of Singapore takes a little bit of travel to get to, at least for the uneducated tourist. Nonetheless, we braved the equatorial heat on our quest of culture and made it there by taking the very well functioning subway and then a short walk where we asked for the way several times.
Inside the museum lobby, we took a breath of cool air and a look around to familiarize ourselves with the surrounding. Obviously this took normal than longer so a very friendly guide was soon by our side: ""Can I help you?"" - ""Ah, well, hm... we are looking..."" - ""What are you looking for? Can I help you with anything?"" - ""Well, we are looking for the shop... Isn't there a Banyan Tree Shop in here?"" We did not have the heart to reveal that we had ventured to the museum specifically to purchase a bottle or two of the Banyan Tree's signature scented shower gel, and that our interest in the museum's display was quite minimal.
However, shopping really seems to be a Singaporean pastime, so our request was not rejected as odd and we were politely shown to the shop in no time. Here we found out that this particular outlet dealt only in small gadgets, little sculptures, and garments, but not cosmetics. Those were sold at ""The Durian"", the shopping mall conveniently located right next to our hotel.
We took a tour around the museum, found it very insightful, and purchased a little golden Singaporean cat from the Museum's store.
Yes, we also found the Banyan Tree Store in the shopping mall, Singapore always delivers on its commercial promises."
,,A pleasant place to visit,4.0,,Get to take a walk into Singapore's history and present. Nice and friendly museum staffs with good exhibits.
,,Good^^,4.0,,"A little bit boring, but really meaningful. I could learn the history of Singapore with an aid of audio guide. Moreover, at 11am, i could be followed by guide, who kindly explained contents. Cuz Exhibit rooms are dark and complicated, it was difficult for me to know where i am right then :-)"
,,Excellent free tour,4.0,,"I wandered across the road from Fort Canning Park and spent a very pleasant few hours in the museum. Having viewed the two exhibitions in the galleries in the basement I opted to join a free tour which lasted just over an hour and was led by a volunteer.

She said at the beginning that it would be a very quick look around the museum which would enable us to go back to areas we wanted to see afterwards. She was a very knowledgable young lady and answered all the questions we had for her."
,,Great Visit,4.0,,"I truly enjoyed my visit to this National Museum. They provide a device to listen to descriptions of the museums exhibits and is simple to use and understand. As you walk through various exhibits, numbers on floor guide you to the recorded information. Housed in a grand old building and in a nice location next to Fort Canning Park. Highly recommend a visit to learn more of the history of Singapore and the people who make up its history."
,,An interesting museum,5.0,,"We are regular visitors and usually take advantage of the Open Days when admission is free. The traveling exhibitions are curated with great detail and have been well presented with activities for all age groups.
Highly recommend the Singapore History exhibit.
Interesting shop and cafe.
Only thing that mars it sometimes is families who can't seem to control their children who run around and are quite noisy."
,,Great way of exhibiting,5.0,,Setup in a great way. Audio tour is amazing. The stories within the history are really nice. Such a nice building.
,,Bewitched by its architecture,5.0,,"I was bewitched by its beautiful architecture, I decided to pay a visit here once.

I was lucky to catch the exhibition ""The Wedding Dress - 200 years of wedding fashion"" in time. It was definitely gorgeous and enchanting. I was also lucky to visit the museum the week after the national day, which was free for entrance.

I love the rotunda dome architecture of the building, also, the overall environment looks so cozy and relaxing.Staffs here are friendly and professional. I enjoyed the day of visiting.

It is one of the museums in Singapore where you have to visit if you come over Singapore and you're into cultural stuffs.

Cheers"
,,First Rate Displays,5.0,,"Anyone interested in the history of Singapore needs to make this a must see while visiting. Housed in a historic building, this is a very modern museum which has exhibits on such thing as local food, fashion, entertainment, and families. I particularly enjoyed the entertainment section which had exhibits of movie posters and ran film clips from Singaporean cinema. There was also a full size Chinese puppet theater and a display of Chinese Opera costumes.

However, the highlight of the museum is in the rear in a new addition to the building. A circular building where you start at the top and work your way down which encompasses the entire history of Singapore from the original natives, through Colonial days, World War II through Independence, to the present day. Everything was so well done, I felt that this was an overseas version of the Smithsonian Institution.

If you flew Singapore Airlines, show your boarding pass and get half off the modest admission charge. The museum also has an excellent gift shop on site."
,,"Very average, confusing layout",3.0,,"Although this museum has a large number of objects in their collection and several important artifacts, such as the Stone of Singapore, the layout of the exhibition is painful. Within the story of Singapore exhibit there are two pathways you can take, both have different objects and cross over at different points, meaning you have to keep backtracking if you want to see everything. Also there are also no maps - we were approached by one elderly lady who couldn't find the exit at all and had been wondering around for 10+ minutes. The tablets computers you are given are very difficult to use and have a mix of audio and text; some of the software functions on them are also broken / misprogrammed. Overall, the objects are interesting, but museum layout could use a serious overhaul to place it in line with Singapore's other museums."
,,A Total Waste of Time,1.0,,"This is most definitely not a real museum but a collection of diverse exhibits. More like an art gallery with a section devoted to the history of Singapore. Even there, the displays are static and fairly poor. The tablet-based personal tour guide for the history section is painful to use - sometimes audio, sometimes text. You spend you time entering numbers into the guide to get information about an exhibit rather than enjoying the exhibits themselves.

I greatly enjoy visiting museums. Sorry to say this but visiting this place is a total waste of time. Go elsewhere."
,,Enjoyable and Informative,4.0,,"Plan your trip - go early and if it is a public holiday, expect to wait. The layout can be confusing but worth the wondering to see everything. Have been several times and always learn something new."
,,history,4.0,,get the general idea of the history of singapore.nice place. again i would like to remind that ..it would be good if u contact the authority to know the timing of the tours available.
,,A wide range of collection and a snap shot of Singapore,4.0,,"A wide range of collection and a snap shot of Singapore, enjoy the half day I spend there. I'm impressed by how knowledgeable the staff members are and their friendly approach."
,,One of the best museums ever,5.0,,This museum is fantastic. Firstly the building is perfectly restored colonial in perfect grounds. The atmosphere is wonderful and the staff could not be more helpful. There are several different sections but I recommend the history section for an exciting and interactive overview of the history of Singapore. As well as exhibits there is an audio guide which is free. You can hear about events from the viewpoint of actual historical figures. The bar and restaurant are first class. You can have a meal afternoon tea or just a drink in wonderful surroundings
,,not for everyone,4.0,,we had a great time - but I like history some of the displays are very static but there is a lot to see and lots of information.
,,Well worth visit,5.0,,"The history of singapore exhibit is quite extensive and worth the time. You get a free tablet with audio visuals, and there is hours of content if try to listen and watch it all."
,,Good historical display,5.0,,I enjoyed it being a person who likes history of empires. I was impressed by the display of the exhibits with real videos. The museum was wheel chair compatible.
,,will come back again,5.0,,"What I loves about this place was the buildings, it's a colonial building I think. So, inside the museum a lot of art and Singapore history. visual and digital. it's a MUST VISIT place!!!"
,,"Excellent museum about the history of Singapore, a must-do",5.0,,"Liked: very interesting museum about the history of Singapore, so much to read and hear, you can spend the whole day there, there are different ""ways"" through the museum depending if you are more interesting in historical facts or stories of the people living at the time.
Disliked: it took so much time to go through everything"
,,"You will love it, trust me!",4.0,,I am not somekind of art person but this place is amazing! I made me enjoy art. It is also good place to learn a lot about history with some audio and photos you will not realize that you easily spend a day here :)
,,Waste of tax payer money,1.0,,The building is one whole empty space. I would guess that around 90% of possible display area is left empty. Just empty walls and floors all around you. The few displays are in about 4-5 conference rooms which you need to pay to get into. These people are not serious in my opinion.
,,"Excellent displays, with audio guide",4.0,,"The route through the displays could be confusing in places, but the audio guide helped. Museum gave a good understanding of the history of Singapore, though the cafe/restaurant next door was overpriced"
,,Beautiful Building,4.0,,"Forget the dusty image of a museum. The National Museum of Singapore is bright, vibrant and the exhibits seem to come alive. It is lovingly maintained in a beautiful building. It has obviously had a lot of money spent on it and it shows. It is well lit and comprehensively laid out. There is also a very nice caf√© and a well stocked shop on the premises."
,,A dose of contemporary art,4.0,,"A great museum to visit with young children as the rooms are spacious, nothing to knock over, the staff were helpful in organising access via a lift to a lower level floor when I had a pram. I saw an interesting exhibition of contemporary Thai art."
,,Take the time to visit....,4.0,,"The museum has really come alive during the last ten years, being officially opened as the N M S at the end of 2006. The building itself is not only impressive, but has very good facilities for wheelchair users and children. Admission charges are very reasonable and there are constantly changing feature exhibitions as well as events, art shows and a host of interesting cultural displays. Always something new and stimulating. Recommended."
,,So interesting - and interactive,5.0,,"Loved this museum - a great introduction to the locals cultures and the melting pot that is Singapore. Loved that you could choose to take a factual, event-led perspective or a more personal, individual perspective through the history. A role model for museums everywhere. And housed in a beautiful building which many newly-weds visit for wedding photos!"
,,Excellent Museum for history of Singapore,5.0,,Allow plenty of time if you go here. Very impressive exhibit of history of Singapore with personal audio. Made the mistake of arriving around 4.00 pm and the museum closes at 5.00 pm. Don't make the same mistake.
,,A very informative modern museum,4.0,,A great museum that offers plenty to see on more than one visit. The history of Singapore display has so much information that it would be impossible to read and listen to it all in one visit. The interactive tablets are a great feature. Also has tours for kids. Highly recommended
,,Very interesting,4.0,,A very informative history of Singapore and if you have spare time I would recommend. The history of Singapore is in a separate area to the special exhibitions and we nearly missed out. A great location too for a wander.
,,Great museum...,4.0,,I have visited this museum twice and enjoyed it very much. Learn about the history of Singapore. It is housed in a beautiful building. Allow at least 3 hours.
,,Good one,4.0,,"If you plan to visit Singapore national museum you at least should have 3-4 hrs. The history part is massive with audio information, you need to sit and listen at each point. Since we were running short of time could not complete the entire part. Also their are other parts called fashion, food, entertainment but are not that amazing.

And yes if you have Singapore airlines boarding slip you get 50% discount on entry fees."
,,Very good museum,5.0,,Excellent guided 2 hour tour told us everything about Singapore. There were also some excellent audio-visual exhibits.
,,Wonderful museum,4.0,,"There was so much information about the history of Singapore that we didn't feel that we could do it justice. So much to read and listen to, you could follow personal stories or events throughout history, fascinating.
Really liked the way it is laid out, the start of the exhibition is incredible."
,,interesting displays on walking tour,4.0,,"We took a couple of hours to do the headset walk through the main history of Singapore part - interesting but took me a while to figure out how to click on all the right buttons for each exhibit, and there is no written info alongside the exhibits so you need to use the headsets."
,,Beautiful place but too expensive,3.0,,"The Museum is lovely but too expensive I feel that the free tours should operate more frequently as its very large and people dont know what areas topay for to see, loved the Fort Canning Gardens opposite the Museum and also down the road the local University eating centre"
,,Speechless,5.0,,"I can not say much about this museum. This is a great museum, a one must go museum in Singapore. Even if you don't like the museum, try to isit this one, only 10 $. You won't regret it. Bring your camera and your camera stand, since they don't allowed you to take a picture with flash. Take the pictures with slow shutter techniques, and make your museum collection picture and try to see things in different point of view. There are lots of things to capture and to study about history, culture, food, animals, and all things which leave in Singapore. Have fun !!"
,,A very much fun way to enjoy museum,5.0,,"The museum has a very complete collection, telling Singapore history since the beginning 'til present. The main gallery tells the history in a very attractive audiovisual and interactive ways, combining hi-tech, as if we're told the history by a personal guide.

History really doesn't become a boring subject here. Awesome.

We visit this museum for free, because it was Christmas day open house. The museum has several days of open house schedule (New Year, Chinese new year, etc). You can check the schedule on the website.

Lockers to put bags are provided, only SGD 1 for big locker, and 0.5 for small one. We can't find food stall, only vending machine for hot or cold beverages."
,,Small but interesting Museum,5.0,,"Compare to other national museum around the world, SG one is not the biggest one and yet an interesting and high tech one. You can see the daily life and food culture in SG. unterstand more of his unique history. The museum use all kinds of high tech to let you experience the things, sounds, movies, videos, files.....It is nice to go and see. takes around 2 hours Max to finish it. Also see many people taking Wedding pics there! fun!"
,,Great museum!,5.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore is housed in a lovely old colonial building, which is interesting in itself. The history of Singapore is really well displayed and most interesting to all age groups. There is also a nice cafeteria on the premises! Seniors can get in for a discounted price, and there are also very well informed guides to show you around."
,,Dumbed-down multimedia omnishambles,2.0,,"Simply awful. Some distinctly uninteresting galleries devoted to items of (at best) marginal interest - the history of satay vendors in Singapore, anyone? - and then, if you manage to find the ""History"" part, an audio-guided, multimedia tour clearly aimed at people who can't actually focus on printed text. If your audioguide doesn't work - both of the ones I tried didn't - you've had it. If you like being incessantly bombarded with sights and sounds and colours then you will love it. If you like reading and learning about history, forget it. They ought to rename it ""The Singapore Experience"" and include a little 3D rollercoaster ride to complete the feel."
,,Finding out about Singapore's history :),4.0,,"The National museum of Singapore is a great place to learn more and find out about Singapore's history and the people who used to live there. It uses many forms and ways to show history, through media, articles and objects, its really great and not boring at all! You can spend a whole day in there.
Sometimes there are special exhibits as well (though they have an entry fee too), which are usually quite interesting too!"
,,trully details about Spore,4.0,,when traditional meet modern! very clearly details shown about the history from the past..original and cool!
,,A Modern Place to enjoy the contemporary art.,5.0,,"This is museum is impressively clean and modern. This is a place where ""study materials"" are presented un-boringly."
,,"""Crown jewel museum of Singapore"".",5.0,,"PRO:
~Features some attractions, which are free.
~Wide walkways.
~Good educational opportunity for kids.
~Guided tours are free.
~Even the smallest exhibit will take you one hour to complete!

CON:
~Have to plan your time well, because of the magnitude of the many exhibits.
~The F&B located inside the museum are pricey, or is at a premium."
,,Well presented history,5.0,,"Modern day Singapore has many merits, but the past is often destroyed or hidden, so visit this museum to learn about the city's past and that of the people of the island."
,,a must tourist site,4.0,,"We happened an a free day. The staff was very pleased to direct us through the museum in the most effective route. Very pleasant cafe and lovely, well presented exhibits"
,,worth visiting to learn Singapore's history,4.0,,I visited the museum while on a business trip and only really had time for the Singapore History tour. i found this a good tour with audio information provided to add to the visual tour. Worth a visit.
,,The best museum in Singapore,5.0,,I absolutely loved visiting this museum. You get digital guide which is highly informative. If you want to learn about Singapore this is the place to visit. Very easy access from MRT.
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"When we last visited in 2010 an excellent Egyptian exhibition was visiting. This time that space was taken up by an exhibition of Singapore during WW11 - more geared to children - disappointing.

Overall it brings it home to you that Singapore does not have much history."
,,Good for an informative couple of hours with historical tour the highlight,5.0,,"The museum itself is a treasure trove of both static and interactive exhibits.

In an effort to bring both modern and historical Singapore to life the management (curators?) of the museum have included exhibits that let you hear, see and literally smell Singapore - a grwat immersive experience.

But by far the best the museum has to offer is the tour through the history of the island using a virtual tour guide and the supplied headphones and pad, which allows the visitor to pick and choose both their route through the exhibit and the depth of information they would like to access when presented with each and every item on the tour.

Great fun, but may be a bit much for the younger members of the family as it takes a couple of hours to really experience all it has to offer.

it's Singapore, so an umbrella is recommended for the walk to the nearby MRT (underground) station or bus stop."
,,Informative though organisation is confusing,3.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore is worth a trip for all who visit Singapore; the museum itself is divided into the Living Galleries and the History Galleries. The four living galleries are quite small but rich in detail and cover topics such as film, fashion and food in Singapore. The history gallery highlights the rich history of Singapore, but it is slightly confusing in its organisation, and is very reliant on the audio guide, with lots of standing around looking at static objects which going through everything the audio guide has to offer."
,,Very complete,5.0,,"The main exhibit, with the recorded sessions, is great. Entertaining, thorough, well done. There are two tracks: history and personal to take through the museum - both fascinating."
,,Good exhibits,4.0,,Good changing exhibits. Should visit during the Night Festival where there'll be special art installations.
,,Great,5.0,,"Every visitor to Singapore should put aside time to visit this museum, and with the visiting exibitions there is always something new to see."
,,Singapore Museum History Gallery,4.0,,"This Gallery has some very interesting displays of Singapores history. We took a free guided tour and it was well worth it. The tour guide had some interesting background information on the displays.
If you wanted to tour on your own, there was an audio tour that you could complete as fast or as slowly as you want.
It is nowhere near as big as some of the U.S. museums, but don't miss it!
The restaurants on site are VERY expensive!"
,,OK for a museum,3.0,,"the singapore museum is a little light on, but some of the temporary exhibitions have been winderful. Keep an eye out for whats on during your visit"
,,Confusing but memorable,4.0,,"This is a fine social history museum with some intriguing things in the collection. The display is imaginative, a series of micro-environments designed to transport you to various different times and sections of society. The result is a slightly claustrophobic jumble of small, dimly lit enclosures that can make you confused about chronology. The entrance is modern and spacious with high-tech digital projections, but then you move into the main part of the museum which is crammed with actual stuff, not touch-screen computers. I love to see real things like this, not interactive virtual displays."
,,Singapore history in a modern building,5.0,,"The museum consists of three blocks of building. The first was built in 1887 and the second was added in 1907. It was totally revamped and renovated with a total new building in 2006.

Besides Singapore history gallery, there are four more Living Galleries: Food, Photography, Fashion and Film/ Wayang (street opera). It gives you a coverage of all aspects of life of Singapore, both ancient days and not so long ago. In the history gallery, the state of the art audio aids really offer complete guide to your tours.

Watch out for their free guided tours if you are there. Ask the front counter for details."
,,A must visit if you like museums,5.0,,"This was a great visit. With engaging displays with sound and tactile interaction, you can't help but get a real sense of the Singapore of the past and how it came to be the place it is today. You will need at least 2-3 hours to fully appreciate this experience."
,,Thank heavens for tour guides,4.0,,"We made our way to the national museum because we are genuine culture vultures, and are always interested in what countries have to say about themselves. This museum is also central, easy to find, and has regular guided tours. We were lucky enough to join a guided tour, purely by co-incidence, as we happened to turn up at the right time. The tour commences in the history dome/ whatyamacallit, which has a film continuously playing, depicting a day in the life of Singaore, with a singing soundtrack that sounds vaguely like a petroleum commercial. The helpful guide ( a young fellow, whose name I didn't catch), then walks you round the bottom floor history gallery. The vignettes of life in colonial Singapore are fascinating, and he relates lots of little snippets of information that are not available on the free headsets or wall plaques. The tour gets a little bogged down in the world war 2 section, and the subsequent complex history of the people's action party, the communists, the...Oh, never mind. He makes it sound pretty groovy, in a confusing sort of way. The way Singapore attained nationhood is a story which alone makes visiting the museum worthwhile. The exhibits are well thought out, although the rest of the museum feels almost like an afterthought. Skip the textiles gallery, do see the food gallery (which will both educate you and make you hungry at the same time), and do see the photo gallery. Touch the little touchscreens, and some fascinating little movies come up about amahs, cross cultural marriage, and polygamy in Singapore (!).
Don't bother with the coffee shop, it's one of the only places in all of Singapore which could be called unfriendly. And, at all costs, do a guided tour."
,,So much to see!,5.0,,This museum is in a beautiful building that is worth visiting for that alone. I spent 3 hours in the Singapore History gallery which was a fascinating journey from the 14th century to today. The displays are very interesting but make sure you collect your audio tour - there are no plaques or signs. Unfortunately due to another commitment I did not have time to visit the Living Galleries so that will be on the agenda for next time.
,,if only other countries had national museums this good,4.0,,This is the first museum that uses electronic interpretation devices that I have actually enjoyed. The creators have done a wonderful job in providing compelling explanations of the artifacts. You can drill down as deeply or as pass by superficially depending on your interests and the amount of time that you have. They have at least two different paths through their main exhibit and you don't even really have to follow them in the preconceived order.
,,Impressive Building. Good a/c!,3.0,,"The security guard watched us like a hawk as soon as we walked in with children! Made us feel very uncomfortable! Also we couldn't find any baby changing facilities and no high chair in the cafe. Refreshments v expensive but basic. Worth a look. Enjoyed The Wedding Dress Exhibition until i was asked to stop the children from talking - i'm not sure why they had a craft table for kids, if they don't like kids attending their exhibition!"
,,nice place to visit,5.0,,"have visit the place during National Day, it's a worth place to visit, the exibhits are interesting and more good for young people. will recomment to my friends ad relatives to visit."
,,Would reccommend,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit, some great exhibitions and things to see. Goes in to the history of Singapore."
,,"A Museum that know how to Entertain and Educate, Singapore National Museum",5.0,,"This is a wonderful example of how a good museum should be. Access is easy, exhibits are well displayed and relevant, explanations are clear.
The development of Singapore perminent exhibitiion is pure joy, educational, interesting, with audio-visuals used effectively.
It also has a very nice restaurant."
,,Great stuff,4.0,,As I've just moved to Singapore I chose to visit the museum on a complimentary entry day. The exhibits taught me a lot about the Singaporean culture and history and I was lucky enough to see two 'artsy' exhibitons about a prominient theatre actor/producer/director and the history of Chinese theatre.
,,Pretty but slightly confusing,3.0,,"Everything looks great, but the museum is slightly confusing . I found it hard to navigate. The History gallery gives a good overview of Singaporean history but misses some important details (or I couldn't find them...)"
,,Wonderful museum,5.0,,Love to come here each time in Singapore. Beautiful building and love the swinging chandeliers. This time wonderful exhibition on weddings with dresses from V& A
,,Great experience!,5.0,,"The way they present the history of Singapore with artifact, interactive media and atmosphere really brings you back to the olden days in a comfortable way. This is a MUST GO museum!"
,,Informative,4.0,,"Loved the building. Exhibition on Singapore history was interesting and educational. Food exhibition was also ok. The rest was a bit ordinary but it was free, so can't really complain."
,,History for everyone,5.0,,The positioning of old & new architecture of the building is cleverly done. We enjoyed the history of Singapore very much.
,,A pleasant surprise,4.0,,"We went there to get out of a tropical downpour and were pleased that we did. Singapore has spent millions on renovating the museum in recent years. The exhibition halls are roomy, and well set up. There were 3 temporary exhibitions while we were there and I am told that this is fairly typical. The only suggestion is turn down the aircon - it's nice to find a cool spot in Singapore but no one expects or wants to be cold - especially in the non-display areas such as the coffee shop or the museum shop. All the staff were dressed as if they worked in a much cooler climate."
,,A rather nicely laid out museum,4.0,,"I'm usually not that much of a museum buff, but have to say that this being one of the first museums that I've been too in quite some time, it was not that bad at all.
* If you're a student, and present a student ID card, your access to the museum is free of charge. Otherwise it's 10 Sing dollars for adults but for children, I'm not sure what the entrance fee was. (There's a small podium right before reaching the front desks that has a chart that shows prices for the different entrance fees though).

Once entering the museum, you won't be disappointed. They had everything from a Photography gallery, Film, Fashion, and Food which could be found on the second floor. The food gallery was one of the coolest as well as the back room of the film gallery. There they had all sorts of costumes used for Chinese opera. Some very extravagant costumes to say the least.
The entire building itself is very impressive alone and is very very big.
Despite visiting Singapore many many times, I had never been here before but it was certainly well worth the visit.
I recommend all to go to this great place."
,,Why should you have to pay?,1.0,,"When told that I had to pay a fee over S$10.00 I walked out. If countries want us to visit their National Museum to listed & see their story we should not have to pay.
The one in KL is free so why not this one?"
,,A Fun Museum..,4.0,,"I like the most is the audio guide that lets us listen and admire the display at our own pace... Gets too dramatic sometimes and the audio tends to drag the time too long but, the information given is really good and fun to hear."
,,Wedding Dresses at the Museum,5.0,,We walked in to spend an hour or two but after three hour we were not close to see it all. If you are a history buff get there in the morning and don't plan anything for the day. There is lot to listen and read through interactive touch pad.
,,Grand old building,3.0,,Beautiful old building with impressive modern extensions. Gave good overview about is tour of Singapore. Took the free guided tour. Unfortunately wasn't ideal as we were there at same time as 3 big groups of school kids so was very noisy crowded.
,,Nice and Amazing,4.0,,I visited National Museum of Singapore few months back and it's really a nice place to visit. I really enjoyed a lot with my friends.
,,Mixed feelings about it,3.0,,"Having lived in Singapore for a long time ..I was very curious to read the reviews here on TripAdvisor about the National Museum, - some of them are downright wrong, others pinpoint the glaring gaps.

The building housing the National Museum was of course purpose designed/build by an enlightened colonial administration, and both the architecture and style of this grand building offer a great setting and frame to an otherwise mediocre content.

There is no doubt that much has been done to deliver Singapore's history in a modern manner; however the very fact that there are no written descriptions next to the exhibits is , in my view, not acceptable. As a serious viewer, you are more or less forced to use the electronic guide , and you are then subject to the slow speed and technical challenges of the gadgets you are given.

Singapore has a great and proud history, and the previous reviewer AmsColombo is simply wrong when she mentions that the history offered only dates back to 1940. The museum very aptly highlights Singapore's prehistoric and early history. It correctly charts the development of Singapore since S. Raffles selected the island for its strategic advantages, and the documents displayed are enough to excite your further interest.

There is a glaring lack if information on the history of the Malays, the Indians and the Eurasians, all part and parcel of Singapore. The exhibition meanders into a Chinese dominant culture, history re-written at times, with occasional fashionable jibes at 'colonialism' that are simply not necessary. After all , Singapore today is a direct product of having been very lucky to have taken over an intact infrastructures established by the British. On the other hand, it is to the credit of Singapore's long-serving prime minister - to leave the British legacy intact after independence , and not fall into the trap to wipe out important traces of the pre-merdeka area. Just look at Malaysia and Indonesia how they lost a vital part of their identity by simply ignoring/deleting architectural and cultural evidence for the sake of post-merdeka machismo.

To me this museum is a museum for the sake of having a museum ..more for external consumption, with good intentions but not a very good delivery; its rendering of Singapore's unique history has a touch of being parsimonious; yes - do have an electronic guide by all means, but please allow the seriously interested visitor to explore the exhibits at his own leisure and give him access to complete information in the form of a guide book.

All in all, it is definitely worth a visit, incl the coffee shop and the museum shop."
,,A great museum,5.0,,"This museum's claims to be cutting edge are a little overstated, but it is nonetheless a world class institution. The Singapore History gallery is worthy of several hours, and tells the story of Singapore extremely well with the help of an audio guide on a tablet that lets you pick and choose what you're most interested in hearing about.
Like many museums in post colonial societies, it is a little thin on pre-colonial history, and rather too heavy on colonial history, but it does tell a great story about the journey to nationhood.
Don't miss the food gallery either!"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,An interactive museum. It is not only well designed but the exhibitions are very well prepared. We had the added bonus of the wedding dress exhibit. A credit to Singapore.
,,Interesting and Informative!,4.0,,I enjoyed the museum very much; it was very intersesting and informative about things I wasn't aware of in regard to Singapore history and culture.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Compared to other countries, our museum collection may be small or lacked of sufficient wow factor but personally I really enjoyed myself when I was there for a couple of times. It will be great if relevant association can be more active to promote public awareness to attract more locals to visit."
,,Interesting Building,4.0,,We took a very informative tour with a museum volunteer (free). We walked to the museum and found it poorly signed and hard to find.
,,If its free in Singapore - question it!,3.0,,"Typically Singaporean, the museum is very well laid out and impecably preserved but not without the modernity and technology of today. The museum is split into 5 galleries which are interesting but not mind blowing. History dates back typically to just 1940; you are therefore left wanting to know more but you really can't find it. It wasn't a fulfilling experience"
,,Treasures & History,4.0,,"Lots of history to view, ""The Treasures of the Aga Kan Mseum"" is amaising, such stunning works of Islamic Art and Architecture on display."
,,Very high quality exhibit but slightly hampered by the technology,4.0,,"Due to lack of time I only visited the History of Singapore Exhibit. It is very extensive and informative, the production values are very high and overall I enjoyed it a lot. Included in the price of admission is an Android Tablet with headphones, which runs an audio guide software. It's very neat and high tech, and as a gadget-geek I liked it a lot. However, two issues lead me to only give 4/5:
1. I got a tablet with a little over 50% battery and I was pretty close to running out by the time I finished. And that was after skipping some parts.
2. Other than the tablet, there is no written text whatsoever in the entire exhibit. Therefore, you have to go at the tempo dictated by the narration. You can't skim over parts quickly without just skipping the explanation entirely. Also, the operation of the tablet is just a little sluggish, another factor to consider for people on a tight time budget. Finally, this is also a problem if the battery runs out, which almost happened to me.
In conclusion, a very good, high quality exhibit, but a little to ambitious on the technology side."
,,Modern for me,5.0,,"I mean this museum offer a modern style, no need for you to bring a tourist guide inside cause they will give you this gadget that will tell you about the things you see inside."
,,Another Singapore Icon,5.0,,"The architectural thought that has gone into transforming this heritage building into a modern facility is a classic example of how well Singapore always seem to do things. There are always a number of different exhibitions on the go, but a simple visit to the building itself is well worthwhile. There is a really flash restaurant with coffee shop on the premises, but the service is attrocious, which is a pity as this was the only aspect that adds negativity to the visit."
,,Early evening visit,5.0,,"We only popped in to this museum late in the afternoon due to brief holiday plans. It was free entry after 5 or 6, and only part of the museum was open. But what a treat. There were a few sections which were completely story driven. One of the areas which focussed on food did as much to help a visitor understand the culture of Singapore as could rows of artefacts. I cannot be more fulsome in my praise for this elegant and thoughtful approach. I am only sorry we didn't have time to visit the whole museum."
,,Happy with the audio visual kit,5.0,,"The audio-visual kit brings visitors to a brief history of Singapore and its culture. The sections and exhibits are all labeled and corresponds with the audio-visual guide on a touch pad.

Be prepared to spend a full day there for better coverage of the museum trip. Half day is sufficient, though. Just make sure the History and Culture theater (with the AV guide) is covered first!"
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"One of the best museum's I have visited. Like many people, I knew very little about Singapore before visiting the country and this museum. I learned so much! It is also a beautiful museum worth the visit."
,,boring,3.0,,"this is such a young museum compared to other countries. nothing fantastic or fascinating to see, which singaporean doesnt know singapore's history anyway since it was always repeated and emphasized."
,,Nice Musuem Experience,3.0,,"The national museum is the oldest museum in Singapore. This museum is not free entry, there are fee charges apply. There are permannent exhibition and some special exhibition. Fees may applied. I am lucky to go in only when it has promotion with free entry. the museum is big and enough for you to spent at least 2-4 hours walking through it. Singapore history, the people, culture, the life, you can find all the story here. if you are into the architectural of building, this museum may also attract you."
,,most well-curated museum I've ever been to!,5.0,,"I went to Singapore for a few days and made my way to the National Museum of Singapore to learn more about the country, since I pretty much had no knowledge of its history. I have to say, the building is absolutely beautiful, though its mostly empty because the main galleries are underground. I kind of walked around the empty spaces wondering where the ""museum"" part was until I found the main entrance, but once I was inside, I found the NMS the most well-curated museum I've ever been to...

You enter the main exhibit and galleries via a cylindrical building and go through a movie...which was the most unnecessary part of this whole experience, since it was just a gathering point. They give you (for free!) an audio guide connected to an iPad-like mobile device that has every artifact with a There was SO MUCH information, it was kind of overwhelming. Every different room was a new group of info (everything had audio), and then the artifacts in that room are listed at the bottom of the touchscreen if you want to find out more info about anything. All the time periods of Singapore are covered, and there is a lot of primary sources and pictures tracing the history.

One thing this museum did very well was understand that not everyone ""likes history"" and maybe some people are dragged here by someone else in his or her party. I say that because throughout the museum, there are two different ""tracks"" you can take -- events and personal stories. Some people love history, and some people don't care for it and would rather hear about personal stories and have history interpreted that way instead of just by dates and battles and conquests, etc; that was this attempts to mollify. I followed the events track, so I actually didn't see the ""other"" part of the museum based on the personal stories. I checked out one room just out of curiosity and it seemed like a completely different museum. (The one room I checked out talked about women's rights in Singapore, yet I didn't see that topic discussed at length in the events track, so it made me wonder what was not covered in the other track and vice versa?)

I see in other reviews here that the audio guide is slow and there's actually nothing to ""read"" on the walls since everything is in the audioguide. To that, I say that Singapore is a multi-cultural place with four predominant languages (English, Malaysia, Chinese, and Tamil), what exactly do people want, extended explanations in four languages under every single artifact and picture and portrait? That is untenable, which is why the handheld device is so invaluable and makes the experience much better. Imagine the crazy clutter everywhere if everything in the mobile device had to be printed and put on display? And the audioguide is great for visitors, because I saw one guide in Japanese, and that would not have been a language on any of the walls, but now those visitors can understand what the museum is showing them. Yes there is a lot of information and the guide is slow, but pretty much everyone around me rushed through the museum because they didn't want to go through the trouble of typing in the number ""40"" on a touchscreen (seriously?).

I compare this to other major museums that I have been to like the Louvre or the Uffizi and I'm struck by how much ""better"" this museum was than those. That is not to say the actual information or art is ""better"" here than at the Louvre (of course not), but moreso I mean how the experience here is so much more user-friendly and there aren't surly museum workers standing around in a perpetual state of being pissed off with having to deal with tourists. The price of entry is SGD$11, and I got in free with a student ID, and the audioguide is free for everyone -- and that stands in contrast to price-gouging at poorly-kept European museums where entry and audioguide are easily 25euros and there's not nearly as much information and ease-of-use as here.

Overall I would definitely recommend a visit to the National Museum of Singapore. There is enough information to spend all day, but after about 3-4 hours, it gets a bit daunting to learn so much. There is a cafe/restaurant at the museum, but Raffles City is close as is the Colonial Quarter, so there's plenty of places to eat around."
,,Museum treasures,4.0,,"An excellent insight into Singapore's history and it's place in SE Asia. You can learn so much about Singapore - it's Geography, people, culture(s) and History. A worthwhile activity."
,,Great,4.0,,"We came here when the titanic expedition was showing. It was truly amazing. The building was amazing. Staff were very helpful, place was clean, easy to read signs. great."
,,nice exhibition spoiled by terrible audio-guide,2.0,,"This could be a nice museum, but the audio-guide spoils it all. There are no descriptions at the items on display, you always have to type the item's number into the mini-computer, then read on the mini-display. The audio is read out very slowly so you have to be very, very patient if you want to hear it all. You could easily see the full exhibition in 2-3 hours but with the audio guide it will take at least 4-5 hours. If you do not hear well or do not understand english very well you are lost completly. There are many better things to do in the wonderful city of Singapore."
,,Just really not much here,2.0,,"Singapore may be a young nation with little recorded history pre-British Empire, but places like the Peranakan Museum and Fort Canning bring it to life extremely well. The National Museum for some reason just doesn't.

The displays are pretty lacklustre, there's a lot of wasted space and although the building is attractive, if you're expecting something of the quality of the V&A or New York's Met, you're going to be very disappointed."
,,Loved this museum!,5.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore is a treasure. The building is lovely and cool. The section of the museum detailing the history of Singapore is fascinating and so well done. The tour is self guided and has a 'history' and 'personal' (more daily life) track so you can follow your interests. Everyone is wearing their own audio headset so I felt I was by myself in my little personal history bubble, not distracted by the conversations of others. I couldn't stay long and would love to go back
."
,,There is indeed more than Orchard road shopping...,5.0,,"Singapore may b young but still has some interesting history..go and combine with a tea in the Raffles,to feel the old charm..."
,,Beautiful building!,3.0,,"A lovely place to escape the heat! I went recently for the wedding exhibition with my partner and she was thrilled about it. The location is great if you want to check out other museums, the Singapore Art Museum is just across the street,"
,,Imaginative view of SIngapore's growth,5.0,,"The bulding has been very well restored with a stunning modern addition. The exhibits are very imaginitively done, in a modern way with multiple tracks to see the history on a personal level of in the bigger picture"
,,Beautiful old colonial building.,4.0,,"We spent some time in here visiting the section which detailed the history of Singapore and also the special ""Wedding Dress"" display which they had on loan from a London museum. This extra was pretty much a waste of time unless you are interested in wedding fashion thru the ages.

A free audio guide is provided at the entrance to the historical section, which was very comprehensive. It took me a while to figure out how to use it but I soon realised that I would probably need a whole day if I wanted to listen to all the stories and view all the exhibits. My one complaint is that the directions were somewhat haphazard and I got lost a few times, even walking into a hidden glass wall in the dark, but if you cop a wet day during your holiday and want to learn all about the history of Singapore, this is the place.

After reading some of the previous reviews on here, I understand that there are other sections which we didn't get to see. This may have been because we saw no signs directing us to any other areas and the receptionist who gave us the brochure was very hard to understand.

There is a small fee, but they do offer a generous senior discount, even for tourists. However, they need to beef up on their directional signs."
,,Misuse of space,3.0,,"Worth seeing, but primarily for the architecture. Much of the space is unused and exhibits seem lackluster. The special exhibit on wedding dresses for example had about a dozen UK and Singapore antique dresses with little description or rationale about why they might be special. To the left of the museum is the ""spice trail"" - a short walk that has an excellent array of SE Asian spice plants ranging from Allspice to Tamarind. The descriptions of the plants are excellent and I found this far more interesting than the museum."
,,Old impressive Building but ..,2.0,,Not impressed with the arts here -- for such a building the quality of displays was a waste of time and space unless I missed something in one of the many corridors and rooms.
,,Highly immersive journey into the history of Singapore,5.0,,"The ""Singapore History Gallery"" is an absolute must see exhibit! Don't leave the museum without seeing it.

It's a self guided tour that lets you choose your own path and experience Singapore's history from different perspectives.

The storytelling and theatrical presentation is wonderful. You can go through at your own pace and explore as much (or as little) detail as you want.

I also had a delicious meal at the museum restaurant. Their service and presentation was perfect."
,,Fantastic presentation - loved it.,5.0,,"This place is fantastic. Only visited the part on the history of Singapore (there are many more sections) which was VERY impressive. Various sections allow you to go through an 'events' channel (chronological presentation of history) as well as a 'personal' channel, where individuals comment on their experiences of the time. These channels converge at various points.
Visited this with my wife and children (13 and 14); the latter were so impressed that they asked to visit the place again.
One TIP from the ticket office - bring school / student ID for your kids; this allows them free entry."
,,"Went for the exhibition, bought very nice souvenirs",5.0,,located just opposite dhoby gaut mrt. very convenient. bought my fav Vincent Van Gogh's souvenir. good quality. very nice place to take photo of. and fully air-con inside. cheap tickets to get in.
,,Great intro to Singapore,4.0,,Only went as part of a free night festival. It was open to 2am and very impressed by size and multi media content used. If in town for several days worth a visit.
,,Excellent exhibition on food,4.0,,I spent a good couple of hours in this museum and found the exhibitions on Singapore history very interesting. One of the exhibitions is quite interactive and you get a headset and can select which information you listen to. My favourite exhibition was the one about the history of food in Singapore where I learnt all about the history of the famous hawker street food.
,,Must see museum experience,4.0,,"A great setting for a museum in a colonial main building with a striking modern addition. A well laid out tour with audio guide, interesting exhibits, stories and artefacts. A wealth of information and one of the best museum tours I have experienced. There are other exhibits in the main building on film, clothes, food. Good in themselves but an anticlimax after the main tour of Singapore's history."
,,A great introduction to Singapore,5.0,,"Spend a few hours wandering this world class museum and get a real feel for the exciting city nation of Singapore. Go on Sunday, and it's not so crowded. Free entry. Concessions for seniors to special exhibitions. Easy to reach by bus or MRT. Static and interactive displays set out in different galleries. The integrity of the wonderful old colonial building at the front of the museum has been maintained by a very clever addition at the rear, and connected by a glass walkway. Family friendly. Save money by crossing the road and walking a short distance through the park to the food court nearest the MRT station."
,,real insight,4.0,,"this museum offers a good insight in the drastic changes Singapore underwent in the last few 100 years.

the whole museum feels like a theatre decor with sounds, video's, personal stuff, ...

recommend for kids, not only because of the overall feel but f.i. one can choose his/her own path in the museum (if you want to know more about economics, or the revolution there is a special ""extra"" walk you can follow)

nice builing, nice collection to see if it's raining of if you're interested in history"
,,A must see for first time visitors to Singapore,5.0,,"The museum has two very different parts. The side where you enter has some cute exhibits, like the history of hawker stands and street food. The far side, history, is a must see if you don't understand Singapore history or Singapore culture."
,,Very Interesting,4.0,,I liked the cinema story at the begining of the entrance to the Museum. A lot of interesting facts and knowledge regarding the birth of Singapore and Sentosa. Loved the life like scenes immensely.
,,"Go to the English Guided tours - mine was superb, two daily at i think 11am and 2pm",5.0,,"Spend an afternoon at this modern, architecturally interesting, and well laid out museum. I was fortunate enough to get a very keen Australain tour guide to show my group around with her collegue, who were both very keen Singapore historians. We were hown how Singapore developed from when it was first inhabited, through the time when the East India Company arrrived, and onwards through the wars and the fascinating evolution from being part of Malaya, and then taking the brave decision to go it alone, 40 years ago.

This led Singapore to become one of the most dynamic countries of the world for business, and economic growth. The creativity of this museum exibits, and the tour guides made visit unforgetable.

I shall have to make another visit!"
,,Good introduction to the history of Singapore,5.0,,We enjoyed this museum and recommend it as a good way of becoming acquainted with the history of Singapore.
,,Don't miss it!,5.0,,"One of the best laid out museums I have seen. I knew very little about the history of Singapore and in my 3-4 hours there I felt I learned more than I could have in a full-semester history course! It helped that we had a ""volunteer"" guide (a woman in her 70s) who navigated a group of 5 of us through the museum.

Don't miss this gem."
,,Don't miss the interactive history exhibit!,4.0,,"We just happened to be visiting the museum on a national holiday, and the admission for all exhibits was FREE! If you are planning a trip to SIngpore over a holiday weekend, it is worth a few minutes wait to see the exhibits.

The history exhibit with the narrative was the best, but also the longest, so I would advise oing it first. They only have limited numbers of headsets, but there is no written narrative, so you don't want to enter without one. You can wander through at your own pace, and they have a children's narrative as well. If you get tired, there are plenty of places to site while you listen, or just rest.

The bridal gown was there, as well as the Gold of the Ukraine, and they were just OK. Quite a yawn after the prior 2 hours we spent in the history exhibit. They do have a cafe and restaurant, so you can easily grab a tea and break while there too."
,,We found it a little disappointing.,3.0,,"Beautiful building, well laid out but the Singapore History section was very dark and gloomy, and unless you used the free audio aid (which was a bit of a nuisance) you had very little idea what you were seeing."
,,Great museum,5.0,,"Discover the Singapore heritage and history there. Some interactive experiences that are interestings. Take a look on the rooms such as the food one, the fashion one, ... And the architecture mixing colonial and modern buildings is great."
,,A little disappointing,3.0,,"The museum is housed in a large and beautiful building, with excellent facilities (such as immaculate toilets). However, I found the content a little disappointing. Much of the museum seemed to be empty. The historical gallery is only worth visiting if you enjoy listening to audio commentary through headphones - the exhibits are not properly labelled, so unless you're listening to the commentary, you have no way of making sense of what you're seeing.
The museum does have interesting visiting exhibitions, however, and it's worth visiting if there's one on show that appeals. We saw the Unkrainian gold exhibit, which was properly labelled and contextualised, and was fascinating."
,,An interesting insight into Singapore,4.0,,"Well structured museum, allowing you to explore following your own interests and pace. Variety of static exhibits plus the visiting collections."
,,Great way to learn about Singapore,5.0,,We did a guided tour when we first arrived in Singapore in 2009. Had a wonderful local guy who gave us so much information. We loved the Farquhar Botanical print collection and the special exhibits such as Pompeii and the Egyptian mummies made being members worthwhile. The outdoor movies were also favorites for us. The Elvis impersonator after they screened Viva Las Vegas was hysterical.
,,Good Museum - not hands on for kids,3.0,,"This museum is housed in an amazing building. It is well done, but not as good for kids. During Children's Month and Heritage Festival week, they have children's activities, but overall, not as well done as ACM for kids."
,,A sophisticated museum:),4.0,,"This is definitely one of the best museum in Southeast Asia. Great display, shows how serious the Government of Singapore take care of its culture:). It's equipped with thechnology, so you don not need a tour guide actually. The history of Singapore is well explained and concise. Just step on the pointed spot, then the machine will tell you all about the display. My favourite was the art section (music n movie) and the gender part:)."
,,Worth the time,4.0,,I really liked this museum. It has some very interesting displays about Singapore and the region in general. The historical account of Singapore is particularly interesting as it is a remarkable success story that has unfolded only since the end of WWII.
,,Not to miss!,5.0,,"Spend a few hour here, you will not regret it, you would understand what Singapore is all about, such a small country, with mixed culture. Great entertaining with their permanent exhibition of Singapore culture, history. They let you choose ways to explore their history - through event (by the book) or through a personal path (by a person), almost like you were there."
,,No better way to understand the history of Singapore,5.0,,"I suppose like every other traveler coming to Singapore, I was obviously blown away by the technological advancement, the very modern culture and lifestyle and naturally was quite curious to understand how Singapore as a nation had come so far in such a short time.
My curiosity was satisfied at the National Museum of Singapore. Would thoroughly recommend this to anyone with that kind of interest."
,,An obligatory stop while in Singapore,5.0,,"The National Museum contains a large exhibit showcasing the history of Singapore from early colonization by the British through Lee Kwan Yew's creation of a modern, economic powerhouse at the tip of the Malay Peninsula, and on to the present.

In July, 2012, it also contained an impressive collection of Ukrainian artifacts - mostly gold, but many pottery and silver pieces, as well. Separate galleries in the museum held art commissioned by William Farquhar, cataloguing the local flora and fauna, fashion memorabilia from Singapore's history, and a great collection of photographs and family stories which underscore Singapore's polyglot social construction.

Admission is ridiculously inexpensive, and even more so if you happen to be over sixty years old. There's an in-house cafe, too. This museum is a highly-recommended visit."
,,History of Singapore,5.0,,"There is a great section in which, wearing headphones for the guided tour, you can learn so much about Singapore's fascinating history."
,,ANZA tour,4.0,,Tour given by a volunteer (docent) was excellent. It covered the historical background of Singaporeort visit to each era
,,Two special exhibitions,5.0,,"Gold Rush Treasures of the Ukraine, and In the Mood for Cheongsam were well displayed and very informative"
,,A Museum....where ?,2.0,,The building is nice....and that is almost it. The different gallery are really small and we don't learn much about Singapore history
,,"Good overview of the life, history and culture of this unique Island Nation",4.0,,A good place to get a glimpse of what Singapore is and has been. Covers everything from ancient to modern life in this unique and wonderful Nation.
,,"""Hi, I'm Brendan De Souza...""",4.0,,"I think this is an excellent museum if you want to understand what makes Singaporeans tick.
The first ten minutes is the best. make sure you turn on your headset when you enter and listen to Brendan...there are a few politically correct things which not all will agree with, but it is there country!!!"
,,A nice visit,5.0,,"We spent two hours there, including the Harry Potter exhibit, the Andy Whorhol exhibit & a snack at their cafe. It is on the city tour stops so very easy to access.We enjoyed it very much!"
,,Really nothing special,2.0,,"I have to admit that they have been surprisingly effective in exploiting and valorizing what they have. Still, in the end you don't see anything really impressive. Even though it's a fairly new state I expected something more in the Historical Gallery. Honestly if you have few days to visit Singapore there are much more interesting things to do."
,,Unusual...,5.0,,"What is? Well, this is the nation's museum and, therefore, I would expect to see a lot of artefacts. May be there are a lot...in storage! For what this excellent museum does is to tell stories about the nation and it's people in a very accessible manner. The 'true' historical background is conveyed by a high tech personal 'Walkman' style piece of kit, won't say more as you need to experience it. In the galleries, there are yet more stories, sometimes told by short documentaries. The ones about mixed marriages and such like are fascinating...in other words, there is also attention to the ICH. Intangible cultural heritage.

Also of possible relevance is that the Novus Cafe is quite a smart establishment. I made the mistake of ordering Mile High Carrot Cake. It could not be finished. For a few more weeks, Gold Rush: Treasures of the Ukraine is running and well worth seeing."
,,Great museum to learn about Singapore,4.0,,Went to the museum with my 2 daughters (5 and 8). Had lunch first in the restaurant: not really cheap but good food and great service. The museum building is very beautiful. The food exhibits are really interesting. My older daughter loves the exhibits of flora and fauna drawings. The history of Singapore is very interesting but too involved for little ones I think.. Still the girls enjoyed the artifacts. They had a special activity zone for kids to tach them about Singapore culture.. Well done. Would recommend for anyone wanting to discover a little bit about Sngapore's past.
,,Good mix of old and new,5.0,,"Not just the buildings, but well displayed sense of Sing history"
,,nice building worth a visit,3.0,,I think the best part of this museum is the room that talks about Singapore cusine . This is a didatic experience and very informative about the spices and the inspiration of this unique cultural mix of cusine. There are also some interesting photographs and historical perspectives but this is not The Louve ot Met or Prada. The new Singapore art museum is in the future. Esentially this is a visit but not a destination that you should go out of your way for unless you want to truely understand the food you will eat at Maxwll Court or better yet Straits Cafe in the Hyatt. Here you can experience the breadth of the local flavors.
,,Knowledge for Every One,5.0,,"I along with family visited on a free admission day. There were lots of activities like story telling, lapel badge painting were going on to engage younger children. For me and wife we enjoyed all the special attractions and exhibitions on Singapore History and Culture.
Excellent and very informative."
,,A Fantastic Museum,5.0,,"The audioguide here was fantastic. Once you go into the history of Singapore section, you can choose to either take the 'events' or 'individuals' path, each explaining the history in a different way. We went half and half, and both sides were good. The museum is well set out and very interesting."
,,Interesting history of the city,3.0,,A good museam right in the heart of the city that takes you through the history of how the city was founded and how it ended up being the amazing place it is today - well worth a visit and at only 10SGD it is good value for money
,,Bizarre but fascinating!,4.0,,"This museum on Sentosa Island is a reliving, life size, of the surrender of Japan at Singapore after WWII. The wax figures of the signators to the surrender is chilling. The animosity of the Singaporeans toward the Japanese after the way the brutalized the people during their occupation is palpable. It is sa=carry, almost, but worth the trip across to Sentosa."
,,Loved this experience,5.0,,An amazing museum. We were lucky enough to see 2 special exhibitions - 'Gold Rush - Treasures of Ukraine' and 'In the Mood for Cheongsam'. The second exhibition was a history of Women and Singapore Fashion. That night we had dinner at the museum restaurant - Novus. This is not to be missed.
,,Lovely Personal Tour By Volunteer,5.0,,"I had a lovely tour by a french volunteer guide. I was lucky enough to arrive at 11am when they had a guided tour by this lovely lady.

I had a vague understanding of Singapore history however the guide really added a great deal to my understanding of the collection and displays. I would really suggest that you time your visit to the time they have these tours by volunteers.

Thank you for the guided tour."
,,Interesting version of history,4.0,,This is a well maintained museum but they had an interesting version of history.
,,Very Interesting,4.0,,A comprehensive history set out in a very well laid out venue. Glad I went. Ebjoyed listening to the personal stories.
,,Poor Poor Poor Comparatively.,3.0,,"Decent exhibits to allow you to know a little more about some of the history of Singapore. Compared to museums in Europe etc, this is a far far cry. What really irks me is the fact that you have to keep paying to visit various exhibits in the museum."
,,"Very nice, a bit tricky to find",4.0,,"The museum is not at all what you would expect when coming from Europe, where museums tend to be old, stuffy, dusty, and non-customer oriented affairs. The set-up is very good, they even have children's entertainment programmes plus a free internet point. A highlight for all fans of shopping (hey, it is Singapore, it is ok to be materialistic) are the museum shops, one of which is run by the Banyan Tree.
The museum is a bit tricky to find when coming out from the subway, so check the map first."
,,Awesome museum,5.0,,"The building is an architectural masterpiece, with domed ceilings and marble floors. Interesting exhibitions run for 3-4 weeks at a time.The current one is about the history and development of the traditional Cheongsam. Watch out for the swinging chandeliers on the 2nd floor - a very creative installation."
,,Interesting trip,5.0,,"Well worth a visit, easy to get around, clean and tidy and its good to learn a bit of history about the places you visit!"
,,Informative Museum,4.0,,"We took a free guided tour of the museum and learnt a lot of interesting things, thanks to the tour guides for giving up their time to share their vast knowledge with us. The museum was well worth a visit, we learnt a lot about Singpore's history from its early days at Singapura.

There are a few restaurants in there (can't recall its name), however we were told there would be a one hour wait for a seat and the coffee shop would only serve what was pre-made on the menu (maybe 4 sandwich options, none of which were vegetarian and wouldn't cater for veges) so we went across the road to an excellent Italian restaurant located in the Art Museum's building instead."
,,one of the better Museums in Sing,4.0,,"Plenty of interesting history to keep the family interested, including a 9 year old girl, for at least 3-4 hours."
,,A suprisingly good Museum,5.0,,Didn't think this one was going to be anything special but I was wrong. It accurately walks you through an historical journey of Singapore through the ages. Great place. Kids would love it also I think.
,,"Dull exhibitions, Amazing building",3.0,,"Amazing Architecutre.. exhibits pretty lifeless... fairly dull museum all in all. I visit regularly as im a Singapore resident, never really changes.. nice place to take pics if you like buildings, and Great for wedding pics as the building is beautiful."
,,Seems to be lacking,3.0,,Beautiful old building and friendly staff. However with the history of Singapore it was lacking in displays. However what was there was very informative
,,Always give new experience!,5.0,,"With such a so called 'museum', it is with different ambience and different decor. Everything is great here. the exhibition always unique."
,,Excellent audiovisual guide to the History galleries,4.0,,The highlight here is the excellent audiovisual guide to the History galleries which allows you to choose which information you want to hear/read and to choose between different paths which present the history from different perspectives. If you try to take in all the available information you will be here some time!
,,Excellent Presentation!,5.0,,Nice presentation of the history of Singapore. Fascinating to see how this city has transformed into a busy Hi-tech place from a small fishing town.
,,Understand Singapore better,4.0,,"This museum allows you to understand Singapore not just from 1965, but also from its very beginning as Singapura. Worth a visit when you have a lazy Sunday"
,,Excellent history section,4.0,,The section on the history of Singapore is very well laid out and you can either take a guided tour or use their very informative self-guided audio tour
,,Very informative,5.0,,The museum was really interesting and I learned quite a lot about Singapore's history. I didn't get to finish looking at all the displays since I arrived at the museum 2-3 hours before closing time. I wish I had more time. The portable audio device was fantastic in guiding me through the displays but the battery died early. Definitely a great place to visit to learn more about Singapore.
,,A day in the museum.,3.0,,I enjoyed looking at the exhibits about the making of Singapore and the Cheong- Sam exhibition. However there was a lot of walking beween exhibits and much empty space.
,,Not a lot here but well worth the visit,3.0,,"The special exhibition is super (we've been to two, now) and free. So well worth going"
,,great museum,4.0,,"It is well worth a visit if youve got a few hour spare. We ended up here as we had a unexpected 7hr wait for our flight back home ,so looking for aircon we wandered in here,so glad we did even though I have been to singapore a few times I think I learnt more about singapore here in a few hours than all my previous trips!"
,,Little history,2.0,,Pretty small museum which only proves the point that Singapore hasn't got much of a history.
,,Always worth a visit,4.0,,"This is a lovely place to visit - apart from being cool and beautiful to relieve the heat and shopping, there are always good exhibitions to see."
,,Great Museum!!,4.0,,"If you come to Singapore,this is one of the ""must-come"" place,forget about Sentosa,Singapore flyer,this is the real thing.
My most favorite part is the history section,you'll know a lot about Singapore history once you finished it, You better come in the noon because If I'm not mistaken they'll be close at 5 p.m
And then there are some kind like food gallery,there are exhibitions about the popular foods in Singapore from Chinese,Malay,or India"
,,The Best Place,4.0,,It was awesome and filled with exhibitions that are so fun. I especially like the clothing exhibition. It was like a maze and we could hear old but trendy songs there.
,,Loads to see,5.0,,We went here because it was raining & were glad we did as it is a fascinating collection which we could have spent more time in. However the sun came out! The Tang ship wreck collection is very good & the textiles and ancient (& not so ancient) artifacts are great
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"I wanted to learn about Singapore¬¥s past, and thus I really enjoyed this museum. The displays are great, with a walking introduction to the museum into a large cinema sort of room. You get a handset with your ticket and you can choose whichever route you want to follow. The museum¬¥s staff are very helpful, tool."
,,I learned a lot!,4.0,,"Cheap, student discount, great information! I took a tour and thought it was very well given. It was free as well!"
,,Beautiful Museum with questionable curators,4.0,,I went to the Cheongsam exhibit- and I didn't appreciate the way the curators displayed the dresses. The room was dark and the details were hard to appreciate. The collection was extensive enough and it WAS a free exhibit.
,,A good couple of hours,4.0,,An interesting display of the development of Singapore. The building is a blend of a beautifully restored colonial structure and modern additions. Museum staff are very helpful.
,,national museum singapore,5.0,,"had a great day here , an excellent display on the history of singapore"
,,The best museum in Singapore,5.0,,The Singapore History Gallery is the place to learn about local history. It is well set out and there is a good headphone system which offers the Events Path or Personal Path. Be prepared to spend a good couple of hours there. - You'll be surprised how quickly the time goes.- Also it is worth visiting the Food Gallery which talks about the different street foods in Singapore (there are 4 other small galleries including one on fashion which I thought was colourful but not very interesting).
,,History,5.0,,A very well done overview of Singapore's history - the free headphones are well worth using.
,,Educational,4.0,,Worth the trip. You have a choice of which stories from history you listen to. My hubby walked one way and I walked the other and we listened to different points of view. His was more factual and mine was more personel.
,,A ``must'' for anyone interested in Singapore's history,4.0,,"This was generally a fascinating and worthwhile museum for anyone interested in learning Singapore's history.. There are two routes: the event path and the personal-story trail. You get a headset with buttons to push for each station. You can spend many hours here -- there are so many accounts that it's difficult to hear them all. Inevitably, some are more interesting than others. It would be best if you could get an advance list of all the topics so that you could budget your time."
,,Very extensive,4.0,,I am impressed with how well planned this museum is. The audio guide is great.
,,not bad,3.0,,"the design of the museum itself is nice.I went to a Qi Pao exhibition which was quite interesting. But for other showrooms there were not much to see. Fort Canning is close to the museum, just within walking distance."
,,Out of expectaions,4.0,,"I love museums and this hugh museum has a very comfortable atmosphere. It's Big, spacious and comfortable sunlight from the hugh glass windows celling. Lots of information about the culture of Singapore. Recommend going to the cafe inside the museum with glass celling on the top after finished the long walk of the museum."
,,Brilliant for geeks like us,5.0,,"We love Museums, but the mixture of history and high tech is amazing as are the hanging clocks over the exculators. The gift store has some cute gifts to take home"
,,Much better than expected,4.0,,"Went with our 11 year old daughter
The section on Singapore's history is really very good, with two different tours woven through the exhibits....either follow people or events - each guided by the free audio guide.
Daughter was impressed and not at all bored...she knows more about Singapore now than I do...."
,,"A worth money museum visit, especially for student tourist",4.0,,"This museum has a lot of things to see, 5$ for me the student tourist. High technology and comfy museum. !! Cool !"
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"but the years that I was interested in, the Merderkah years, did not really deal with the bits I remember so well. Not surprising in some ways, because we (even at the age of 10) were the expat occupiers. What was of great interest was to see how Singapore has developed 'from a 3rd world country to a 1st worlder'. I was impressed by the humility and depth of contemplation that led to the eventual development of Singapore, due in no small part to the foresight of Lee Kwan Yeu, but also outsiders. I know of no-one like me, who grew up here albeit in different circumstances who does not love this country (and who also retains a certain anarchy of outlook perhaps because of the great freedom we enjoyed here as children),"
,,Much better than expected,5.0,,"I went to NMS with modest expectations, but left blown away and wanting to return soon. The exhibits are very well done -- the interactive audio-visual devices are a great way to bring them and Singapore's history to life. Highly recommended."
,,"Really nice mix of information about Singapore, its history and its culture",4.0,,"The history gallery really brings to life the story of this small but impressive nation, ""living"" exhibitions cover various aspects of Singapore's past and present."
,,Interesting insight into Singapore history,3.0,,"Great exhibit showing the history of Singapore, with supporting handheld sound system. Not much else there to look at, although a fine building."
,,enjoyable visit.,5.0,,Enjoyed the building and all the current exhibitions.
,,National Museum - L√≥uvre,5.0,,"A wonderful, spacious and well-appointed museum in Singapore; Favourite feature was the recent Impressionist paintings from the L√≥uvre - thank you for bringing these to Singapore!"
,,Learn the history of Singapore,4.0,,An audio guide is included with your admission fee. I learned so much about the history of Singapore. It's so large that I needed another day to see it all. I had to skip a lot of the audio guide toward the end because it was just too long.
,,Superb Blend of Old and New,5.0,,A colonial building is attached to a state of the art glass museum. Very well done exhibits tell the story of the city state from the beginning. Great content.
,,Great Museum,5.0,,Beatifully laid out in a stunning Old Colonial building with sympathetic modern additions very interactive and takes a good couple of hours to do it justice.
,,A great insight into the Singapore history and culture!!!,5.0,,We went to see the Titanic Centenary Exhibition but also saw a lot about Singapore's history and were most impressed.
,,History of Singapore very well presented,5.0,,"The History Gallery would take a long time to see everything. I visited after seeing the ""In the Mood for Cheongsam"" exhibition and spent 1.5 hours before I needed to sit down. Will go back and do more next time.. Don't miss this exhibition.."
,,Very well done,5.0,,Excellent introduction to how life was in the various periods of Singapore's history.
,,Unexpected treasure,5.0,,This attraction was not really an essential part of my itinerary for my 5-day trip to Singapore. I included it because it was close to my centrally located hotel and I like museums. So it was supposed to fill any gap caused by a sudden and expected Singapore torrential downpour that made outdoor stuff unviable. My expectations were not that high. My disappointment came when I realised I hadn`t allocated enough time for it. It is a great museum! The building is old and looks impressive but the museum itself has a modern perspective in showing its exhibits. I chose to rent a headset and control device which makes the museum a great interactive experience and means a guide is not necessary. Singapore is a young country so many of the exhibits concentrate on its recent history (especially World War II) which also appealed to me. It turned out to be one of the highlights of my visit. Don`t miss it!
,,"If you like history, this is a good choice",3.0,,"The walk through history made this museum worthwhile. But, if you are looking for art, there's not a lot to offer."
,,Enriching experience!,5.0,,"It's nice to learn other countries' beginnings. I was able to learn a lot of things about the history of Singapore when I visited this place - from the country's humble experience to where it is now.

For only 10 SGD, my friend and I were able to go around and explore the rich culture of this country. It is best to ask for a recorder that you can just press per station to hear the the history of the one on display. I felt that i have learned a lot while i choose which display i'd like to look at. It's different from other areas where a guide will tour you around. At least in this way, you have control on what you want to know."
,,History in 3-d,4.0,,Very thorough and informative. Lay out is a bit confusing.
,,Needs plenty of time,4.0,,There is a lot to see in parts of this museum. As to be expected it concentrates purely on history of Singapore. The free electronic guided tour devices are very good. But some times you found yourself staring at a single painting listening to a very long description/story. If listen to allow it it will take quite a few hours. Entrance fee was reasonable and there is a small cafe for lunch if so desired.
,,Great for kids,5.0,,Excellent set up and personal complimentary audio tour worked well for all ages
,,Worth spending 1.5 to 2 Hrs,4.0,,"The place has a nice ambiance. One can learn more about Singapore by visiting this place. The audio guide is nice and quite informative. It opens at 10 am, so charges are reasonable too. The section on dress and food etc may not offer a great exhibit or information to most of the visitors. However, the main area offering historical walk-through is nice. So in case one has less time you know what to do."
,,Tracing The History Of Singapore,3.0,,"As the oldest and most well-known museum in Singapore, the National Museum Of Singapore traces the history of Singapore from its founding, till the modern age.

Several noteworthy points of interest stand out in the architectural design of the National Museum Of Singapore. The building is an amalgamation of both old and new. The old is represented by the colonial exterior at the front. Step inside, and immediately, you'll see the beauty of the Rotunda, with its restored stained glass. Climb the colonial staircase, and you'll be standing in the Glass Passage, which allows a view of the Dome.

Venture further in, and you'll come into the Concourse, which links the old section with the new. Also here is the Canyon, with its high walls and ample space.

The National Museum Of Singapore features several permanent exhibitions. The Singapore History Gallery, at the Concourse, is the main attraction here, and traces the history of Singapore. The 'tour' is interactive, as visitors are given an audio headset, which provides an audio commentary as you walk around the various displays. You can choose from 2 paths, an event path which traces well known events, and a personal path, which gives an individual perspective on history.

Stepping into the Singapore History Gallery, the first stop visitors come across is the 360 degree 'Day in the Life of Singapore'. You then descend the spiral ramp to the rest of the gallery. In order, the sections include the 14th Century (and features the Singapore Stone), the Founding of Modern Singapore (with a portrait of Sir Stamford Raffles), Straits Settlement, Crown Colony, Battle of Singapore, Japanese Occupation, Post-War Period, Self-Governance, Merger, and Road to Independence.

The other permanent exhibitions at the National Museum Of Singapore include the Living Galleries of Film & Wayang, Photography, Food, Fashion, and the Goh Seng Choo Gallery which features the William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings.

Other noteworthy points of interest around include these sculptures:

20 Tonnes (Outside Front, 1st Level),

Seeds (Outside Front, 1st Level),

The Living World (Outside Front, 1st Level),

Transformation (Outside Back, 1st Level),

Pedas Pedas (Chilli) (Outside Back, 3rd Level),

Contours Of A Rich Manoeuvre (Swinging Lamps at the Concourse),

and The Building Remembers / Remembering The Building (Wall of the Concourse).

The current temporary exhibition is In the Mood for Cheongsam: Modernity & Singapore Women, at the Basement's Exhibition Gallery 1. This features the history of Cheongsams, how to make a Cheongsam, and famous Cheongsam wearers in Singapore.

If all the exploring has made you hungry, stop by the Novus Cafe at the Concourse, which offers snacks.

I loved my visit, although I did feel that the Living Galleries were underwhelming, as compared to the History Gallery.

If you're planning a visit, do note that ticket prices for admission costs SGD $10, and allocate around 1 to 4 hours for a visit."
,,Museum and Fort Canning Gardens,5.0,,"We did not originally plan to visit the Museum but ""stumbled"" upon it after visiting the Battle Box in the Canning Gardens. This is worth a look too. The Museum has about 4 floors and very interactive. Lots of stories to listen to on the exhibits, so suggest that you allow yourself at least 4 hours. There are a few eateries inside too - looked and smelled very inviting."
,,Interesting,5.0,,"Must visit. Good to learn about about Singapore history and there is sections on clothes,cooking instruments and preservation of food,etc. very diverse things you can find in this museum which is great."
,,Very informative,5.0,,A great way to get to know a bit about the history of Singapore
,,very good for a rainy day,4.0,,"Very interesting museum located in walking distance to Orchad Road mainly about the history of singapore. Many different exibitions, all very intersting (great was the colorful exibition about the food in singapore). Everything was modern with high tech equipment (you could watchto many films and listen to audio informations) quite impressive and very entertaining. You can spend easily more than 3 hours in the main exibition. There is a nice restaurant for a little break."
,,2.5 hour power tour,5.0,,"For the trip to the Singapore Historical Museum, Alex navigated to the closest MRT stop only a few blocks away from our lunch location, and very shortly we were within walking distance to the Singapore Historical Museum. The key for day travelling in this region is to plan for air con sites and air con modes of transportation to get there and Alex did well. When arrived at the museum, I had not overheated and was ready to enjoy some history immediately. The day pass was $10 Sing and I wish we would have had more energy to spend the day exploring. We stayed about two and one-half hours which included the introduction and walking through personal histories which we played on personal audio players. This allowed the three of us to do each minuet together and discus after. We also visited a smaller section of the museum that offered the food history of Singapore, and with all the eating we had planned, who could pass that up!"
,,A must go,5.0,,"Take the time, even if not your thing to do. Wonderful, informative, peaceful, amazing... okay enough you red to go see it on your own..after all you are not paying me for full details :) !!"
,,Take a guided tour for most benefit.,4.0,,"Although the building is beautiful from outside it seemed a little empty and lacked information boards - however, a guided tour is a must as you can find out so much more. The tours are delivered in a range of languages. It is interesting, we especially liked the food exhibits with the "" aroma boxes"" !!"
,,A must do attraction...,4.0,,"If you're a first time visitor and want to find out more about the history of Singapore, worth a visit. Probably best to check online before you visit for the latest exhibition news, although they do have some permanent exhibitions such as history of Singapore.
Allow at least 2 hours...more if you're a real museum buff."
,,Always an interesting visit,5.0,,"We happened to go to the museum on a day when entry was free, the exhibitions in the museum are always fascinating and informative."
,,Good Museum with interesting special exhibits,5.0,,"If you are into culture, this museum has great exhibits that rotate often enough to keep it interesting."
,,interesting with areas of asian history,4.0,,"there are lots of small displays including photography, beautiful hand drawn nature pictures etc , a great way to spend a very very hot or rainy day in singapore
just a warning, we wanted to have lunch at the cafe, the inside smelt very strongly of oily cooking, the outside we had to wait for a very long time and then were asked to share a table which we agreed to, once seated we just couldnt get any service so walked out"
,,History of Food in Singapore,4.0,,They have a nice display of how food has become such a big part of Singapore life and the various cultures that have made their mark.
,,A rich and vibrant museum,4.0,,"If you have a few hours spare, perhaps on a rainy day (common in Singapore!), you could pop in to the National Museum. It is housed in a rather grand colonial building on the edge of fort canning park. They also have some great temporary exhibitions. Last years inclsuded Christian Lacroix, ancient egypt, and this year some pieces from the Musee d'Orsee came to visit. The living history gallery is amazing - a great mix of media, hands-on or interactive experiences and artifacts. The kids I was with with thought it was great, although they whizzed through it. There is also a very nice cafe called, Novus. All in all, quite a creatively put together museum."
,,Cultural Experience,5.0,,Great history with different paths to walk to understand the history of Singapore and then a stroll outside in park to round off your day
,,History of Singapore explored,4.0,,"Loved the fact that, although I had visited Singapore many times, this visit to the National Museum of Singapore taught me everything I had not known about the culture and history of the country."
,,Grande olde dame now looking snazzy!,4.0,,"Interactive exhibits, well curated in an atmospheric old building. A nice way to spend an afternoon browsing on Singapore history."
,,nice,5.0,,"nice but small, i thought i would be much bigger :)"
,,Different from other museums,4.0,,"This museum does not have a lot of exhibits but what I liked is that instead of showing an artefact along with dates etc, they should how the artefact or piece of culture was used during the history of Singapore.

They do have a 'Singapore history' section that you go thru with headsets which I found very interesting. This section of the museum has the most pieces and tons of information which you can select on the device.

I would say you can see the key parts in 2 hours or less. You can also easily double that time if you desired."
,,Well worth the visit,4.0,,"A well laid out museum. To get the best out of it, join one of the (free) guided tours."
,,Engaging!,5.0,,Loved the electronic guide at the history exhibit! It really brought the pieces to life with the audio stories. The setup was very interesting and you feel like you really got to know Singapore's past. One afternoon wasn't enough! I hope other big museums around the world will add this electronic guide.
,,very good,4.0,,really enjoyed this museum. very informative. a nice cool place to go on a hot day and very interesting.
,,interesting.,4.0,,"The museum had a face lift a couple of years ago and I'm not sure its as good as I hoped it would be, very arty but short on information but still interesting and wont eat up too much time."
,,Excellent and very informative Museum!,5.0,,This is def worth a visit for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the history of Singapore. The displays are incredible and the commentary fascinating.
,,Very bland museum,3.0,,A disappointment. I didn't come away feeling like I had learned much about Simgapore. Too much emphasis on interactive and multimedia displays at the expense of telling coherent stories about SG.
,,A great place to learn about Singapore's history,5.0,,"I really liked the museum as a last stop before heading to the airport for my trip back home. You can learn a lot about Singapore's rich history in a didactically very well thought-out museum. It offers many multimedia shows and with your personal electronic ""companion"", you will be lead through the gallery at your own pace. You should at least schedule 2 to 3 hours for the visit. On weekdays, the museum seems to be a popular place for school field trips - so it can get quite crowded."
,,A must see when visiting Singapore,5.0,,"Everything about this visit was fantastic. A real history story well told in a great environment. Congratulations to Singapore on putting together and then maintaining this national treasure.
I was enthralled from start to finish and for the first time really understood the British involvement in Singapore and the impact of the Japanese invasion. The audio equipment, which was part of the entry fee was excellent and really added to the experience."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"The best way to become familiar with any country is to visit its national museum. The National Museum of Singapore is absolutely worthwhile to visit. It is big and impressive, and gives a great opportunity to realize how these totally different cultures co-exist together in a pretty small country."
,,New to the hotel,4.0,,"Near to the hotel. The museum covers the entire history of Singapore, the different periods of its development"
,,Allow 2 to 3 hours!,4.0,,"Rainy day? fed up with shopping? Well do a museum crawl.

I did, and the National Museum - easy reach of the MRT (City Hall) fitted the bill. Lovely building, seems empty when you go in, but once up the top, and down the ramp its almost 3 hours of fantastic story-time and exhibits. Free Audio guide all the way that YOU control. Well worth the visit, rain or shine.

If you are a SENIOR, use your card and pay half price: S$5. Quality!"
,,Well Curated Displays,4.0,,"Do you prefer to learn about history by the events that took place or by the stories of how people lived? This museum offers two trails through its displays depending on your preference, both narrated through the audioguide. I took the latter and saw artifacts of schools, families, industries, heard stories of wealth and poverty and came out with an appreciation of the last two hundred years of Singapore. My husband took the 'events' route and saw different perspectives of the same period. There are places of overlap but the routes and approaches are sufficiently different that you could take both without repeating much.
There is a restaurant and snack-bar in the museum; both are very pricey. The food in the snack bar was very good, but the service was very poor."
,,Very nice museum worth visiting,5.0,,"Nothing to dislike about this museum, that has all the attributes to be a great place to visit."
,,Preserving the Past - and how!,5.0,,Excellent displays and helpful staff. The Belitung Wreck was particularly fascinating.
,,Really interesting,5.0,,Great museum with interesting exhibits. The building is lovely too.
,,Impossible to see everything in one visit,5.0,,"My husband and i have visited this Museum a couple of times. It is a real gem but you can only see so much without getting too exhausted. The history of Singapore is very well presented and I was particularly interested in the women's stories. We were amazed at our last visit to find that we had been there for 4 and a half hours! My husband has a mobility problem but there were plenty of seats to sit on whilst watching videos.
Two minor problems quickly resolved 1) my husband's headset didn't work and there wasn't an attendant readily accessible and 2) I couldn't find the loos easily!"
,,Somewhere between average to good,3.0,,"The museum is relatively modern with respect to the architecture i think somewhere between renaissance and neo-classical. There are lot of interesting artecrafts and also the history of Singapore through pictures and films.

If you are not a museum person you might want to skip it and enjoy the shopping/food."
,,Spend all day,5.0,,There is so much to see and read of the rich heritage of yesteryear's major shipping port and business hub of today.
,,"Fabulous, well laid out and very interesting museum, a must see",5.0,,"Walked here from Clarke Quay on our way to Orchard Road. Glad we did. The building itself, an old colonial white building dating from 1887, is a delight and the history exhibition one of the best we have seen on a city anywhere overseas. Entrance costs are low and give seniors discount for overseas visitors. You are given a Companion handset available in English, Mandarin, Malay and Japanese to do a self guided tour or you can join a guided tour instead which takes an hour and started at 11am. The handset for the self guided tour was very easy to use. As you walk into the beginning of the exhibition you are encompassed by a 360 degree film on the sights of Singapore past and present which really is fantastic, and goes along with the belief that Singapore is definitely in the fast lane!!
The Museum begins from the 14C and looks at all the different cultural influences over time from Indian, Malay, Chinese, Dutch and British, covering 700 years of history.
There are 2 paths you can follow, one called Events representing major historical happenings and the other, the Personal path tells the historical stories from a people's point of view, both very interesting and sometimes giving very different perspectives.
We thoroughly enjoyed this very engrossing museum and spent 2 hours along the Paths revealing Singapores colorful history. Highly recommended."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,An attractive building with a well laid-out museum. They have a lot of different ways of presenting their interesting material. Well worth a visit.
,,Holy Jaded Elephant,3.0,,"We stopped here after a long day out and about so I may have been too tired to appreciate it. It seemed a bit sparse to me but we enjoyed the jade elephant (beautiful); the photos and relics from the early riverfront trade and the ancient opium pipes. Again, we stopped in at the end of the day so probably just a little too tired to truly appreciate."
,,Awesome!!,5.0,,Best Museum I have ever visited!! Its a must visit when in Singapore!
,,Very interesting Exhibits,4.0,,HIstory of Singapore well done. Art exhibit extraordinary. Handicap Friendly.
,,Short visit,3.0,,"This seemed to be a good museum, but I visited after 6pm (when entry is free). Many of the more popular exhibits close at 6pm."
,,"Beautiful building, central location and most of the collection, very accessible.",4.0,,"I feel I've known Singapore after a trip down history lane and hearing it from the original voices of the past. Be sure to take the tape recorder. A little suggestion, add the aroma of food in the food section, afterall, Singapore is a place for gatronomical experience."
,,singapore history and culture,4.0,,"very nice, clean museum, but the headsets were not working, near the park too."
,,Fascinating display in a lovely building,5.0,,Really enjoyed the historical displays as these are beautifully designed and feature many authentic items. The art gallery also had a terrific exhibition from Paris which was lovely and well curated. Good museum shop and cafe. Above the museum is the historical area which is most interesting and highly recommended.
,,Not the most interesting Museum.,3.0,,Not a lot to see despite the name of National Museum.
,,WELL ORGANIZED,4.0,,A Fascinating Museum in which we spent several enjoyable hours walking around taking in the well arranged themes. The Museum is well situated and near MRT stations as well as walking distance from Orchard Road. Certainly worth several more visits to view the new themes.
,,Great to have showcased pieces from Mus√©e d'Orsay,4.0,,"I was able to visit ""Dreams & Reality"" which features Van Gogh's Starry Night. I went during an open day and it was pretty crowded plus I had to queue for about 20 minutes (which ain't bad as it's free).

As there were a lot of people, there were a lot of distractions and I took a shorter time looking at the paintings than my usual.

As for the attraction at the 2nd floor which features the History of Singapore, there were a lot of interesting facts but I think the ""virtual companion"" says too much about a single thing that I always find myself skipping tracks."
,,Best museum EVER!,5.0,,The taped assistant that is part of the admission price along with the cool exhibits could keep you in this museum for 3 days EASY! Don't make the mistake of sitting on the ledges between the columns just inside. It's almost like gum...
,,A must see for art lovers,4.0,,"We saw the ""Dreams and Reality"" exhibit that showcased impressionist paintings from renowned painters like Degas, Millet, Manet, Monet and Van Gogh. The highlight was definitely seeing Van Gogh's 'Starry Night'. To make it even better, it was free admission when we went there for the Lunar New Year. I was told that they often have free admission during key holidays.

It is a short walk from the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station. Upon entering, look up to see the dome with its beautiful stained glass windows. Also look for the glass passage on the 2nd or 3rd floor. You can go there if you take the stairs directly in front of the entrance. You can see the dome from the outside through the glass roof which makes for a cool picture.

Their permanent galleries includes a Singapore History and Singapore Living galleries.

It is open from 10AM to 6PM and adult admission is regularly just SIN $10. You can take pictures so long as you don't use flash. You cannot use a tripod."
,,very interesting history of Singapore,5.0,,"We enjoyed very much this museum which explains beautifully the history of Singapore; it is very well organized and everything is wonderfully presented; they also have a lovely coffee shop inside the museum, good for lunch or breakfast or just a drink."
,,A must-see Venue,4.0,,"After its major renovation years ago, it only gets better. The haunted stairway has been blocked for safety reason.
The building doesn't stop fascinating you from inside out, with every step you take you will spot stories and histories of the island.
If only the alfresco areas of the bars in there are breezier....everything would be perfect."
,,nice view from sand sky park,4.0,,"awsomeeeeee, but the merchandise its quite expensive"
,,National Museum,4.0,,"There were 2 attractions on when we went, the first was a Van Gogh exhibition which was distinctly average but the actual museum was very well laid out and informative. We walked around the museum for hours and ran out of energy at the end."
,,"fabulous French Impressionist exhibition, Free internet",5.0,,"Beautiful Restaurant, but wrong dish arrived... expensive Museum shop with trashy stuff, but exhibitons marvellous, and aircon lovely. Architecture and internal design a pleasure to be in."
,,Exciting,5.0,,"Great museum. Interior design an experience in itself - beautiful, so well done. I enjoyed immensely the history exhibition of the citystate, very informative and well told I thought. I spend three hours there and will be back for more. In the cafe I was served a great salad named: ""...better than Caesar"" - and it was. Tasty, crisp and fresh. Cheeky waitress had me on when serving coffee, I like those teasing remarks, makes it all extra memorable to me. Many more exhibitions available. Huge place. Very roomy, lots of space also despite many visitors. Top experience all the way."
,,"Superb architecture, great content",5.0,,"Like many national museums, this one has undergone some architectural changes to make it more attractive and accessible. It works. The history galleries are extremely well done and the living galleries are fascinating."
,,Great way to spend two hours in SG,5.0,,"I regularly visit the NMS when I am in town because it has special exhibitions. This time there were paintings from Paris' Orsey.

This is a perfect stop if you want to learn about the history and modern history of Singapore. Slightly nationalistic but what national museum isn't? There are also good cultural exhibits about food, daily life, etc..."
,,Great for phototaking,5.0,,"The building is gorgeous, and some exhibits are nice."
,,What an exhibit,5.0,,"We went to the National Museum because it has a special exhibit from the Musee D'Orsay, which is there until early February. Strongly recommend seeing it."
,,Gorgeous building!,4.0,,Enjoyed their special visiting exhibition of French art on loan from the Museum D'Orsay in Paris. It was a wonderful way to spend a couple hours out of the heat and away from the crowded shopping malls on Orchard Rd.
,,You Truly Get Singapore History,4.0,,For 10 Sing $ you get a digital media device which tells you about the different eras in Singapore's history. As you walk through the museum numbers on the floor are punched into the media devices. This allows you to go at your own pace and enjoy it more.
,,An Intense Review,4.0,,"This museum gives quite a comprehensive coverage of the major events in Singapore's history. Which means that you really need quite a few hours to digest all that is displayed - which can result in a serious case of indigestion. My advise is to go visit it a few times, taking in bite size information each time. Or take a break at Novous Cafe - it serves wonderful food and beverage.

,,Well Worth It!,5.0,,"This Museum is superb. It is in the old Raffles Museum to which has been added a new and amazingly designed wing at the rear. The Singapore history section is incredible, and includes two trails - one documenting ""events"" and the other the lives of ordinary people. When I was there, there was also a traveling exhibit from the Musee D'Orsay in Paris featuring paintings by Monet, Cezanne, etc."
,,excellent collection,5.0,,historic building featuring tons of treasures. singapore govt spent alots of money on old buildings and make them stunning.
,,Great place to learn about Singapore's history,5.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore has several exhibits showcasing different aspects of Singapore's history and culture, including fashion, food, photography and cinema. The highlight of the museum though is where you take an audio tour of Singapore's history. I spent maybe 2 hours in here and it wasn't enough time! Highly recommended."
,,"Free entry for students, ntuc union and teachers!",4.0,,"Really educational. They are having this amazing gallery from Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay, Paris featuring these beautiful art pieces by Van Gogh, Alexandre Cabanel etc. A must see :)"
,,A nice mixture,5.0,,"The hisotry of Singapore area is interesting, particularly the sections on WW2 and the occupation of the country. The use of head sets with a choice of commentary from people who were there at the time, both sides, is superb."
,,"Great Displays, very interesting",4.0,,"Great displays showing the history of Singapore and the food, fashion, photography, film etc of Singapore. great for the whole family and a calm cool respite from the bustle of Orchard Road"
,,Lovely,4.0,,Just interesting... if you have like 3 hours to spare for some arts and history infusion.
,,Where it all began...,4.0,,Find out the historic roots of a small fishing village in this region and the story of how it's grown...
,,Fresh and modern building/build and a some nice insights into culture and history.,5.0,,"The Museum building itself is worth viewing, for the mix of old and new architecture. There was an Impressionist's exhibition when we visited, which was very impressive, including Van Gogh's Night Sky."
,,Pleasant modern museum,4.0,,"We just happened to go on the last day of a special art display and found there was no charge which was a nice surprise. The museum is clean, spacious and well arranged, but a little too spaced out for tired feet. The shop is excellent. We did have trouble getting a taxi after our visit though as they cannot see visitors waiting at the museum entrance back off the road."
,,Excellent. History gallery is a must visit.,5.0,,"This was superb. Especially visit the history gallery with audio head phones only then you will find your time worth it. You'll come out a lot more knowledgeable and appreciate the diversity of singapore. I also liked the exhibit on food, with different spices on display.

Very easy to get to by local buses and MRT.. All bus stops have mpas so you can easily spot which bus will take you here.

There was no fee to enter the museum."
,,Excellent attraction,5.0,,Superb exhibits and personal audio in the history gallery and in the visiting art exhibition from Paris. Service in the cafe was a bit of a letdown but should not takeaway from the excellent main attraction
,,CarolH,5.0,,The interactive displays are excellent and are well worth visiting especially if you have not been to Singapore previously to discover some of the history of the country
,,Allow plenty of time,4.0,,"This museum is very large, so much to see. Interesting and actually quite peaceful."
,,Worth every minute!,4.0,,"Friendly staff and welcome. Fascinating place, we go there every time we are in Singapore and take out guests and family along too. We also recommend the Museum to everyone we hear of who is coming to Singapore Super place and lovely to read up and see the history of this astonishing, brilliant and vibrating city/ country."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"I really loved this museum. I wish we'd had way more time. We took the ""personal"" path where we heard stories. There was so much to listen to on the audio guide I could have been there forever. I'll definitely go back. I didn't even finish the personal path and didn't see any of the event path."
,,Lovely building,5.0,,"The architecture of the building was beautiful, but the exhibits were amazing. Initially we went after 6pm when its free, but returned the next day to see what was closed after 6pm (Dreams and Reality exhibition) and was amazed again by the exhibits. Worthwhile."
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,This is one of the finest museums in Southeast Asia. Very original displays. This year's attraction is the collection from Musee d'Orsay.
,,Not bad to escape the afternoon rain,4.0,,"There was an exhibition from Mus√©e d'Orsay Exhibition on when I visited, the arrangement was pretty good and the audio guide was cheap (SG$3) and totally worth it.

The other parts of the museum were pretty interesting as well, you'd get to know more about Singapore. Great place to spend an afternoon to escape the heat and rain."
,,Good special exhibitions but,3.0,,"Visited this museum before it was remodeled about 6 or 7 years ago. This time, enjoyed a special exhibition with art from the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. But the high-tech approach to presenting the history of Singapore to be cumbersome and lacking; found I learned more the last time. The exhibition on foods of Singapore seemed directionless, though the smell-o-rama parts were a change from the typical museum experience. The exhibition of flower paintings from the early British colonists is still a highlight."
,,Nothing Interesting,2.0,,"There are much more interesting places in Singapore, do not waste you time in a weak museum like this, building is worth to mention only"
,,To understand Singapore,5.0,,"Spend a couple of hours here. It's air conditioned, so it's a nice relief.

Do the history of Singapore gallery. If you have an inquiring mind, do it slowly and you will begin to understand thes complex and multi-layered city.

Don't bother reading anything after the Japanese retreat, unless you have an interest in the propaganda arts since form that point on this government-sponsored museum tells it like the Lees see it.

then choose whichever of the other galleries match your particular inclinations. It is beautifully done and, the contemporary history part excepted, the curation is not more politicized than the major museums in London or Paris."
,,You wouldn't regret giving this museum a visit,5.0,,"For a complete review with pictures, please drop by: http://rollingwrites.blogspot.com/2011/12/dreams-and-reality-national-museum-of.html

I went for the exhibition Dreams and Reality which features 140 works from Musee d'Orsay. It totally delights me that I am able to view these pieces without having to go all the way to Paris. And even though I'm not good at appreciating art, I found the information next to the paintings sufficient and informative. For further information, you may rent a device (I'm not sure what you call those) for $3 and you'll be able to better appreciate the works.

By the way, you may want to go in January 2012 instead for music by Debussy/Ravel/Liszt, performed by very well-known Singaporean performers, who have performed internationally.

Free for senior citizens (Singaporeans, PR, above 60), children (below 6), students (with valid student pass). Otherwise it's $11.

There are other exhibitions which I plan to go another time. This exhibition is only till February, so go while it lasts!

p.s. Even if you decide not to go for this, checkout the other free exhibitions!"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"It's easy to navigate, educational and informative"
,,I will be back!,4.0,,This is a great way to learn a bit of history. There are not many valuable artifacts but even with the lack of artifacts it is amazing what has been done to make history come alive. Since I didn't get to see everything I will have to return for another visit!
,,Limited exhibits - could do better with the quality of space they have,3.0,,"Visited Dec 2011. The history of Singapore was ok given how little is known of the island's early history.

The exhibits on food, fashion, photography , film were average at best.

Would have liked to see more of the colonial history presented.

Was fortunate enough to be there during an exhibition of famous paintings from Musee d'Orsay in Paris."
,,First on The List of Attractions,5.0,,Follow the history pathway to see the history of Singapore and how many of us share part of it.
,,So much to learn from this museum in every way!,5.0,,"One of the first museums I visted in Singapore that took my breath away. There is an audio machine guide you may take with you when you look around. Anything that may interest you you can easily learn. SOO MUCH culture and history like in a classroom. I was amazed and fascinated. You look at any section you want and you aren't required to see everything. I was able to ask any questions I want and enjoy the entire architecture. If you have a thing for postcards, they do provide various free ones plus creative ones at the shop. At times the museum may seem dark and gloomy at times. I admit that may have been a bit extreme but they were trying to re-create the mood of previous times so you may sympathize. Not a bad idea if you look at it from a different angle. The entire building is modern and spacious. If you go during the summer and sunny days, the entire area is gorgeous.

The cafe outside the entrance is also refreshing. I highly recommend stopping by there as well !"
,,Beautiful temporary exhibition,3.0,,"The permanent exhibition is not much to see. Check if there is a temporary exhibition, these are usually good."
,,Great display,5.0,,"I have always love visiting the national museum as I find places like this really calming, good place to reflect. It also helps that our museum has good general display and over the years, I was took that the visiting exhibitions from the world over have been very impressive. If I am a tourist, this place is worth stopping by."
,,One of my favorite museums in the world,5.0,,Really worth a visit for a snapshot of S'pore. Everything and anything you need to know about S'pore can pretty much be found here. Wonderful restoration work and the interior is top-notch
,,Very informative,5.0,,"This went well into the history of Singapore and as a student of politics, found it very interesting. Had a lot of beautiful artifacts."
,,Nice mix of history and art in different exhibitions,4.0,,"I went mostly for the exhibition on the history of Singapore which is, as other reviewers describe, presented in a very modern way including a very good MP3 audiotour (included in - comparatively very low - admission fee to the overall museum). I particulary liked the elements explaining how the various cultural groups came to Singapore in the first place, and the detailed description of the Chinese culture (the other cultures get a bit short-changed, probably representative of the population, thought). There are plenty good characterizations of the history exhibit, so I'd rather mention briefly that some of the other exhibitions about the culture of Singapore (food, fashion, film - to mention a few) are quite insightful as well and give the first-time - or even repeat - visitor to Singapore a good idea of the culture of the city.
During my visit the museum had, as an additional attraction, a nice traveling exhibition of impressionist paintings which then also added the classical art angle to my visit. A great way to spend a rainy afternoon in Singapore, and the building itself is also a pretty mix of old and ultra-modern (a wedding party used several spaces on the inside as a back-drop for their pictures)."
,,Excellent way to spend a couple of hours in Singapore,4.0,,"I visited the National museum at the start of November 2011, I found it a wonderful mix of historical and cultural information along with a visiting exhibition from the Musee d'Orsee in Paris. I would highly recommend going to the spend a couple of hours in the National museum if you have sometime in Singapore"
,,The way history should be presented,5.0,,"This was fantastic. The tour is done by MP3 in your language. Each exhibit is a track, so you pick the ones you want to listen to and skip the ones you don't.

Plus, it's very interactive. Very little was behind glass or locked away, you literally walk through Singapore through the ages.

Fantastic way to spend a rainy afternoon. And good value for money too."
,,A wonderful museum,5.0,,"This location was on our list of things to do during this visit. Lucky for us, there is an art exhibition of the French Impressionists currently showing titled 'Dreams and Reality' which is a collection of paintings, drawings & photography from the Musee D'Orsay Paris. This featured works from the greats - Manet, Monet, Van Gough and many others. The rest of the exhibits in the museum were also interesting. I would recommend this museum for a cultural treat."
,,The highlight of our trip!,5.0,,"This was a highlight of our trip not only because we are information buffs - but the NMS truly offers every visitor something or the other. The displays include visual, sound and sensory effects are are truly world class works of art. The history trail with audio guides is a MUST do and invokes a sense of wonder how SIngapore became to what it is today.

We were lucky enough to catch an art collection from Paris at the same day and were awed to find a genuine Van Gogh on display which only showed how world class the museum really is to attract such shows for prolonged months.

It is a quirky, fabulous place to visit!"
,,One fine day at the Museum,5.0,,"Me and my wife went to this museum on a rainy day. This museum is a must see to those who are into museums. They have a very organized exhibits, well trained staff and volunteer guides, and the fee was reasonable.

Will surely recommend this to our friends."
,,Worth a QUICK look,3.0,,Some good exhibits BUT disappointed with their art exhibition. Tiny tiny plaques which were difficult to read in poor light. Waited in line to read them on many occasions.
,,Singapore in a Nutshell,5.0,,"We visited NMS during their open house in May 2011 which saved us a few dollars on museum entrance fees! NMS was our first stop on our SG itinerary as our hotel was just a block or so away. The museum staff were friendly and courteous. They made sure to impart to us the house rules of the museum since we decided to not to get a guide for the museum tour.

We had a great time in the museum as we got to discover the history of Singapore. The exhibits were in spacious rooms, giving visitors comfortable space in viewing them. The temperature in the museum was cool which was quite a welcome because it was so humid outside.

It was quite a memorable morning. My sons enjoyed the interactive exhibits while my husband had his fill of photographing museum architecture and sidelights. Plus we got to ""educate"" ourselves about our travel destination."
,,painting exhibition,4.0,,"love the painting exhibition. They have paintings by Monet, Manet, and Van Gogh (only one though.. but it's better than nothing)"
,,singapore's finest!,5.0,,nice museum! a lot of nice galleries and exhibitons!
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Very interesting exhibits, plus the story of Singapore and the old photographs were really good. We were fortunate to see the Terracota Warriors exhibition which was just amazing."
,,Beautifully done,4.0,,"This museum is beautifully done, in European style. Its holdings include interesting sketches from Singapore's earliest days. I also caught a brilliantly-organized Egyption exhibition here. Wonderful space."
,,Museum,5.0,,I went to the museum on a Sunday and really enjoyed the experience. I loved the photography section and had a really lovely lunch in the cafe.
,,It's a great museum...,5.0,,"Beatiful, well organised, very enjoyable museum... If you like museums and wonder about the cultural and historical background of the country you are visiting, you shouldn't miss this one. I visited there with two girls age 5 & 15 and they both enjoyed it. But we had to shortcut it and spent only 2,5-3 hours there. It was definitely worth!!!"
,,such a dissapointment,2.0,,"i was so looking forward to visiting this museum, but what a huge let down, it is an incredible building both in terms of its victorian architecture and the dramatic, but sympathetic modern additions, however the curators have lost the plot. it is basically devoid of exhibits. it is as if there has been a deliberate attempt to deny the years of british occupation and influence and yet no attempt to supply current relevant exhibitions. one long room was occupied by nothing more than a car boot sale purporting to be art. it struck me how many staff were around and how bored and embarrassed they looked. maybe we were there at the wrong time, but frankly it was abysmal. my wifes head was aching after 45 minutes so we went out into the rain with great relief."
,,National Museum SG,4.0,,entry is free somedays so donot waste on tickets... chek the package online.... on national days and holidays entrry is free ... v nice galleries of exhibitions... dont miss if there is the SHORTCUTs movie shows... very enjoyable show
,,Its building is elegant,4.0,,"Here is the place to get to know better Singapore, esp. the story of it...
though as a young country, it has quite much history to tell...
I like the building of the museum, with the dome and large yard around.
Nothing is very special, but the fact that it's elegant, large and very clean - it does impress me....

See you"
,,An OK museum with a good overview on Singaporean history,3.0,,"My definition of a museum normally includes ancient artifacts or art. This museum definitely did not include many 'artifacts' or art for that matter, but it does give you a great overview on Singapore's history and culture with the use of visual aids (posters and captions) as well as an audio guided tour.

Only took me about an hour or two to navigate the entire museum. I actually find halls dedicated to food, clothing, and entertainment fun so this worked for me. The audio tour and historical overview of Singapore was a bit lengthy and I ended up doing that the end of my tour so I was a bit restless (would recommend you start there).

Definitely worth a visit for the architecture and the cool red swinging chandeliers near the main visitors entrance."
,,"Tourist, pls put at Last Option, you can find the infor on net.",2.0,,"I have a shock on all the compliments & reviews to this Museum before I start to write.

Before I visit this musuem, I have visited few museums before, Malaysia -KL & Melacca, Louvre @ France, British Museum, Shanghai Museum, Taiwan Museum, etc.

This is the most lousy Museum I have visited ever. It is a very small museum, the display items inside is very limited and what I can see is a lot of TV & banner, board with wording in the museum, the informations you should able to obtain in internet. What I can appreciate is only the nice hostorical building, the peace environment at the cafe.

The worst case, I felt the lighting is very dark and the whole journey at the self service Audio Guide is like a MAZE. My kids age 3 & 6 is not really like the atmosphere inside. A lot of partition inside, turn here and there....

It is not recomend to tourists who have the short trip in Singapore, you can find more about Singapore by visting China Town, syed alwi road for Malay & Indian Culture (the real place).

As a F&E tourist, If you have more times, then it is a good visit for Understand the Singapore Culture.
As for local residents, it good to visit as a peaceful day.
As for kids below 6, not much they can appreciated from my personal experience."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"This was about my 7th visit to Singapore but my first to the museum, and I really enjoyed it. We visited the special photographic and watch exhibitions that were on, and then spent time visiting the galleries about the history of Singapore

I learned a lot and can highly recommend this, especially when the weather outside is not so good"
,,A very informative national museum!!!,5.0,,"We created our itinerary mostly based on tripadvisor reviews and we don't have to regret about it. Personally, this museum is the greatest one I've been. It gave us a lot of lucrative information over Singapore history, its initial establishment through a very logical displays. When came to the third floor, you will be given an audio guide with headphones so as to explore singapore history on your own.In the different areas in the exhibition, you will be guided to press different section in audio so that it can match the introduction. Very interesting !!! However the only minor flaw is that the audio guide is just provided in English , which can be an obstacle for those who can not communicate well. ( We went with a french guy and he admitted that he can barely understand the guides)"
,,Best option for a rainy day,4.0,,"If you have limited time in Singapore and the weather is sunny, I would suggest that you go and explore the city. If you are, however, faced with the common Singaporean thunderstorms, then the National Museum of Singapore is just an excellent way to spend a large part of your day.
The museum is beautiful, but for me it was mainly the electronic guide that made it such a memorable visit. The audio guide talks you through the exhibitions and as a result, you gain up so much more knowledge and details on what you would normally quickly pass by in any other museum. The best feature is that almost every item on display has a unique entry in the guide's database. Hence, in addition to the standard audio tour, you can listen (or watch!) in more detail to the things you find particularly interesting. It certainly triggers curiosity and extends your stay.
The history gallery is interesting from start to finish, although I found that the parts on recent history and present put a little too much emphasis on how great and prosper life is in Singapore. Also, I felt that the exhibition showed very little on how and under what circumstances the British left. I found that rather peculiar, since there is, however, much attention for the first free elections and the foundations of modern Singapore on the Singaporean side. The end of the British reign, however, remained a bit vague, while all that has passed before that was explained so extensively.

The museum also features a ""living"" gallery, besides its historic part, but I did not find that very interesting. The history gallery is more than enough value for your ticket. In the basement there are often temporary exhibitions. In June, I visited photography by Abbas and Swiss watch making by Vacheron Constantin. They were both worthwile."
,,In depth look at the History Singapore,4.0,,"We looked at the historical section of the museum which provided really interesting and in depth look at the history of Singapore.
You are given an electronic guide and headphones and you can explore at your own pace.
It views events and personal accounts from the beginnings of the City up until the present day. The detail of the historical account can be to a point of information overload so if you dont want information overload dont go into every account given.
Possibly would want to do the museum over a couple of days if possible but definitely scope to do it in one day."
,,A great grounding in what Singapore is about,4.0,,"Firstly, worth visiting just for the buildings - both the old and the new. Secondly, the historical Singapore section is a great introduction to the history of the island, with thoughtful and informative displays (just make sure you get the included audio guide, as all the information is there, there is very little in the display captions). There are also separate galleries devoted to food (an important part of Singapura culture) which is very interesting and allows you to smell certain ingredients; movies and Chinese opera; and fashion. There is a gallery with rotating/visiting exhibits, a good shop (a good place to find interesting and stylish gifts and souvenirs) and a cafe (which we didn't visit). Definitely a place to visit when you are in Singapore. The ticket also includes entry to the nearby Art Gallery, which is also worth a visit."
,,Extensive and exhaustive (in a good way),5.0,,"I just visited the History section over the course of a few hours. The free audio tour is incredibly detailed, you should definitely be prepared for a long day if you want to hear everything. I did end up skipping parts towards the end due to information saturation and the need to see other attractions during my short visit to Singapore, but I would definitely come back to finish off the sections I missed, and see the rest of the museum. The ticket I bought also got me into the Art Museum, which is just across the road and also a worthwhile visit (am about to leave a positive review for that as well)."
,,Excellent Value for Money,4.0,,"We had wanted to visit the Museum for some time and the opportunity came up unexpectedly. Excellent value at $10 each and it was a benefit being early before school tour groups arrived. The Living in Singapore displays were very professional and ""Food"" and ""Photography"" stand out as excellent. Be sure to go to the next building for the impressive audio tour. The upstairs shop and downstairs shop annex were great for Singapore souvenirs and gifts."
,,goodlooking museum,3.0,,"Good place to go if u know nothing about chinese, malaysia or india. The venue is bit small."
,,Gives very good overview of history and culture of Singapore,5.0,,"I visited the History, Culture, and Food sections of the mueseum. It is worth while just going to the History section which is pretty extensive and provides very good background of Singapore. It gave me a much deeper appreciation of Singapore particularly around its transformation to the economic and financial hub through various challenges after the WWII. You get discount if you present your Singapore airline boarding pass."
,,A fsntastic introduction to the history of Singapore,5.0,,"We didn't visit the whole museum, but spent a very enjoyable few hours here in the history section learning all bat the history of Singapore. The audio guides which are provided free give you a huge amount of information about the exhibits, with in-depth information about any exhibit it you ar more interested in.

We took our boys aged 9 and 7 and they found it fascinating also, particularly the WWII section."
,,"The best, big and modern Museum I've been...",5.0,,"The best, big and modern Museum I've been to. This is where you can esily learn more about Singapore Culture and history. A compliment was the portable sound guide and detail story was written in English. This is a must-do in Singapore and highly recommend."
,,"Worth visiting, and fun for young children as well",4.0,,"We were there with our children: my sister's children are Singaporean, while my children are American. This museum keep them equally interested. Everyone of us was provided with an audio guide. We were to look for the numbers on ground to listen to stories and descriptions. Not only did it provide a few hours of learning, we all had a good time doing it too. Absolutely worth visiting."
,,Excellent history museum,5.0,,"This is an excellent museum, with well organized and engaging displays. Singapore is justly proud of its history, and this museum tells Singapore's story in an informative fashion. Highly recommended"
,,"Excellent, especially the History of Singapore gallery",5.0,,"Excellent, especially the History of Singapore gallery.

Displays on food, families, clothes etc and we could have spent all day in the History section alone. Audio guide, with commentary on almost every exhibit if you wanted it. Also excellent cafes (Pear/apple/mint juice blend was extremely refreshing)."
,,Excellent opportunity to learn Singapore's History,5.0,,For just $10 you can learn a lot about Singapore's history and have a better understanding about the richness of Singaporean culture. The individual headsets allow you to choose the subjects you want to know deeply and save you some time in case you are not interested in a particular subject.
,,History of Singapore,4.0,,"The National Museum of Singapore is Singapore‚Äôs oldest museum where we may have experiences to know more about the major events in Singapore history and the personal stories of individuals who witnessed the history as well. We may also experience how Singaporean daily living in the past such as what kind of clothes they wore, what kind of food they ate, and what kind of movies they watched.

Basically this museum is divided by 2 main parts: Singapore History Gallery and Singapore Living Galleries. The Singapore Living Galleries itself is divided into 4 themes: Fashion, Food, Film & Wayang and Photography.

The museum provides an audio-visual companion handheld to help the visitors to get brief information about the exhibitions and artefacts.

I really enjoyed the museum. When I was there, I didn't feel like I was in museum because they present anything in creative and different way. If you like to know or learn Singapore history, this place is a better place to be visited."
,,Truly a museum for the 21st Century,5.0,,"As far as layout, content, creativity of displays, and sheer breadth of information this museum may be the best of the several dozen I have visited in my life. I actually passed up the Asian Civilizations museum on my last day in the country to come back here for a second visit.

The museum itself is roughly broken down into two areas:

Singapore Living Galleries. These four Galleries celebrate the creativity of the country through four vehicles: Food, Photography, Fashion, and Film. The galleries can be appreciated as superficial eye candy or as in depth studies of How to Make a Cheong-Sam (Fashion) and Interracial Relationships (Photography) among others. Of note, they are open from 6-8:00PM free of charge. Many of the personal stories especially in the Photography section are quite moving.

Singapore History Gallery. This is a separate section from the above. Before entering, you are given an electronic audio/visual guide which provides information on each item or exhibit. After a spectacular walk-in video montage, you are then able to choose between an ""Events"" path or a ""Personal Stories"" path. The former is classic history as usually told by historians. The latter path tells history through the eyes of people who lived through it. Both paths obviously have their own merits and you can switch between one and the other with ease. There is way too much information in this museum to go through on one visit, but that to me is a big plus. I would much rather leave a museum wanting to come back than to walk through in a couple hours and feel satisfied.

I haven‚Äôt been to the new American History Museum in D.C. but I can only hope they used this as a template. If I ever come back to Singapore this will be at the top of my list for a return visit."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"The museum is very pretty and it's great to get out of the humidity outside. You could spend ages in the history of Singapore section. You go through it with a headset which tells you information. It is good in a way since you can look at displays while being told what they are, but also bad since there is just so much information you can't go through it all. I like to skim through information in a museum, but with this I couldn't skim, you either had to listen to all of it or none of it which is the downside. Nevertheless, it's definitely interesting though and nicely displayed."
,,A cool oasis to while away a few hours,5.0,,"In the cool setting of the National Museum it is easy to while away half a day or more. First thing to note is the setting. An excellent example of a historical building interacting with a modern annex providing a glorious space to wander within.

Remember - if you have a recent Singapore Airlines boarding pass you could be eligible for additional savings. I received a 50% discount on the SGD$10 admission price.

The main gallery to visit is the History of Singapore using the interactive companion providing audio and visual information. The wealth of information available on this set is huge. Almost every exhibit in this section will have a number next to it and when input into the companion more data is provided be it audio, text, or video. There is actually too much information and you do have to be selective on what information you're interested in else you'll be there to closing time.

The other exhibits on Singapore Life are minor diversions. I recommend the photo exhibit which has fantastic interactive LCD screens."
,,Culture and Air Conditioning,5.0,,"Located near Dhoby Ghaut railway station, the National Museum provides a fantastic insight into the past and present of Singapore, as well as a cool respite from the humid conditions.
Interesting displays, interactive components and vivid images and artifacts tell the discovery, growth and development of this island nation. The gallerys before entering the main circular walkway are fun and enjoyable, the swinging artwork located above the main walkway is fantastic, and the opportunity to choose between a straight events-based history or a people-related storyline (with changeover points) will suit a variety of families and groups. Don't be put off my the initial dry, just-another-museum beginning. The 180 degree theatre presentation of the discovery of the island marks the beginning of an interesting adventure that can be perused thoroughly, or skipped through lightly with only stops at items of interest.
The portable sound guide is great, and provides an aural accompanyment to the visual presentations. (Tip: take note of the length in minutes of each sound grab from the screen of the player. I found that despite my interest in many things, sometimes standing in front of the object in question for 5-10 minutes was quite tiring.)
Seating can be limited at times, but as most of the storyboards are in English, you can quite quickly glance and move through sections that maybe of borderline interest.
Overall a fantastic place to visit, and very highly recommended if you only can fit in one 'cultural' instutition."
