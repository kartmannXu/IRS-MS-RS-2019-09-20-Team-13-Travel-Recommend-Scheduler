,,interesting show,4.0,,The location is quite far from the city centre. It is a nice bird bark with good shows especially the High Flier show. The tram ride is very crowded with people and the queue takes about 15 minutes. Be sure to also visit the Lory Loft to feed the birds.
,,superb,5.0,,"A Lifetime Experience, All in Singapore should make sure they visit Jurong Bird Park at least once in their life."
,,Good Park for kids,4.0,,"We were total 3 adults and 2 kids. Tickets cost us around 125 Singapore dollars. We reached there around 11 am. A nice place to visit especially with children and better if you like birds. Large array of birds are kept including penguins. It’s good if you walk around and cover the place on foot. Many varieties of hornbills which you won’t find anywhere else. A small tram which costs 5 dollars extra, but must try. It covers the whole park. Few food joints are available near the entrance as well as outside. But the show stopper was bird feeding area. We enjoyed this activity the most especially my daughter. Nectars are available at 2 dollars which you can buy and feed the birds. They will come and sit on your hands and eat the nectar. Bird lovers will definitely love it. There are some other live shows also take place which you can attend. Overall an interesting place to visit. Keep 3 to 4 hours to complete it."
,,Best bird park,5.0,,I have visited Jurong Bird Park long back in 1998 after 20 years now it seems like completely change. For thouse who like and love birds and also for the kids specially its a beat place to visit.
,,Bird Sanctuary,5.0,,Nature lovers will be mesmerised and thrilled with the many species of birds housed in Jurong Bird Park. A great stroll to see the beautiful array of birds chirping in a huge span area. Not to be missed!
,,No roast pigeon served at restaurants here,4.0,,"Beautiful park, worth a visit if you’re interested in rainforests or attractive birds. The park is not as spread out as the Zoo, so no real need to take the tram. It’s great that normal people have the opportunity to see rare species of birds, so dingbats who object to animals in captivity should not bother to visit and leave useless reviews. hope that when they move near the Zoo, they can reproduce the amazing vegetation here."
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,Went there with my wife and had a great time getting to know all the types of bird. Will be back for sure
,,Fun for the whole family,5.0,,"Went to the Bird Park with my two kids (ages 8 & 10) and we all loved it. Without trying to repeat what many other reviewers have said, here are a few tips for maximizing your experience:

Go early in the day to avoid the heat and larger crowds.

Attend all the shows that you can, they are free, educational, and very entertaining.

If you have young kids (under 10), bring swimsuits so they can use the wet playground.

If you are in good health and do not have very young kids, a tram ticket is not necessary. The park is not huge and is very walkable.

Bring a picnic, outside food is allowed, and the food options in the park are just ok."
,,Must visit for bird lovers,4.0,,"This was my second visit to the park and was totally worth it. For some one who loves birds and nature - will have an awesome time.

Don't miss the shows that happen at particular times around the park.

Also carry swimwear and get wet at ""Birdz of Play"""
,,Variety of Birds to see!,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a must see place if youa re visiting Singapore. It has an excellent variety of birds, which one doesn't get to see in urban environment. The Parrot Paradise section is the best. It has at least 15-20 different variety of parrots/ macau birds.
The entire park can be covered in 4-5 hours easily on foot. For senior citizens there is a tram, which takes the tourist around the park and stops at different sections. Tram ticket is extra.
First thing you should after entering the park is find out the show timings. There are 2 main bird shows - Pool Amphitheater Bird Show and High Flyers show (currently being shown). Both these shows are excellent and if you are travelling with small children, they will simply love it.
Once you note the timings, you can plan your movement inside the park accordingly and cover all the sections by keeping the show timings and location map in mind.
In certain sections, the birds are much free inside the large area and you can actually touch them, feed them etc. while larger birds such as different macaus, hornbills are in large cage like areas. There are few live demonstrations also conducted with some real birds, which are handled by the trained park staff.
Overall a truly enjoyable bird park visit, worth the money."
,,Great park,4.0,,"Recently visited with my two kids 7&5. Bought as part of 4 park pass. It’s a little far from the city but we had a great day. Loved that you could see the animals from the tram. We were advised to do a full lap in the tram by a friend and that’s what we did. We then went back to the animals we wanted to see more closely. The park has a nice kids water play area - recommend that they have a supervisor at all times as some parents were not watching their kids. The shows were the highlight of our visit. They were fantastic and the people who ran them were great. Very clear speakers, easy to understand and very entertaining."
,,Great fun,5.0,,"We all enjoyed ourselves here. We saw both of the shows, and fed the Lorries. The kids spent an hour in the wet area. It was very hot and sunny. I was glad we arrived at opening. It also gave us an hour before the huge crowds arrived. There were no taxis when it was time to leave which was frustrating."
,,Unforgettable trip for me,5.0,,"Bird Park is a little bit far from the city but it is a nice natural place to visit. I recommend visiting early morning. For me, I visited the bird park first and I went to Singapore Zoo from Bird park by taking a Taxi (Grab). It lasts only about 20-30 minutes. One unforgettable memory is that I lost my wallet at the taxi stand of Bird Park. I knew losing when I arrived at Zoo. I come back to Bird Park and asked the staff of customer membership counter. They said my wallet was kept at the counter because someone found my wallet and gave it to the counter. OMG... I was so happy.
Jurong bird park is a nice place and there are many species of bird there. You can take the photo with colorful birds."
,,Amazing Bird park,5.0,,"Don't miss this for anything, and better to reach by 9:30 am so you can buy the tickets and then head to the Kings of Prey show at 10 am and then roam around a little and go for the 11 am show called High Flyers. in both this shows you end up seeing most of the birds in the bird park."
,,Pretty birds but it's old,3.0,,"The bird park is nice but shows signs of aging. It's difficult to see the birds through the old-fashioned cages and difficult to take their pictures. Also, the park is on a hill so it's really hard in the heat to walk up and down constantly to see the birds. The little train that takes people around stops too far from the trees we want to see. All in all, I'm happy it'll be moved closer to the zoo, it makes much more sense."
,,Not value for money,3.0,,"Very far off from the city, Not a big variety of birds found. Not at all value for money. Can be avoided."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"We spent a whole day here, the most beautiful bird park that I have ever visited. Bird paradise. We booked to have lunch with the Parakeets and Cockatoos. The birds are fantastic, the cockatoo named Picasso actually painted a picture. All the birds well looked after . There is also an opportunity to handle the birds. All the bird shows well worth seeing. Would visit again."
,,Brilliant!,4.0,,Good time! A lot of exotic birds to see along with live shows & all. Definitely better than the River Safari & Night Safari! This park would also take nearly a day to complete! Great for kids!
,,An experience,4.0,,We really enjoyed the bird park. There is lots to see with lots of shows as well. The infrastructure is looking a little out dated as it awaits a move to the zoo.
,,The experience was pleasant.,4.0,,It was a pleasant sight to watch the birds like penguins and flamingos that I don't get to see often. One hard striking thing was that some species (like some parrots) were kept in cages and it was disheartening to see that.
,,Singapore Travel Diaries,5.0,,The bird show at Amphitheater was amazing! A good 4 hours atleast to explore the entire park. Meet the Flamingos at the pool for sure !
,,GOOD OVERALL EXPERIENCE,4.0,,Shuttle Bus Services could be improved and timed as per the shows scheduled in the park. A live commentary could also be arranged for imparting information about the birds.
,,It's a must see place,5.0,,One of the most beautiful bird parks. Well organised. The birds shows they have are fantastic. One may find it better than the Singapore zoo. It is a bit far from the city but worth a visit. Ideally you require a day to really enjoy the place
,,A hot but great afternoon!,5.0,,No getting away from the heat at these outdoor attractions in Singapore but this park sure is worth the sweat. The waterfall atrium is just fabulous and I could have spent the entire afternoon in there. The show on the stage was thoroughly entertaining too.
,,"Must Visit - For Residents and Tourists alike. and for Families and Bachelors, Old and Young",5.0,,"Just something for everyone (Excpet those who are damn hungry and can't appreciate beauty of a bird, but can only eat one)"
,,Captivating birds,5.0,,"The jurong bird park is well maintained and a pleasure to visit. We spent a full day and despite the rains making it not possible to have some events, we were happily tired by the variety of captivating birds we encountered throughout. The waterfall was a sight to behold."
,,Still amazing,5.0,,It has been almost 15 years since I last visited the Bird Park. It still amazes me with the shows and new theme of Singing Forest. It won't be long to my next visit.
,,Visit to the bird park,5.0,,My friends were visiting from the USA and I was very proud to show them the bird park. They were very impressed with our bird collection as well as how nice the entire experience was
,,Not sure what to think!,2.0,,"I have done a lot of travelling and sight seeing with my kids and I bought the 4 parks in 1 Singapore Zoo deal. We headed to the bird park on the first afternoon. (Didn’t realise it was so far).

It came to rain but we still wondered around the whole place.
If I’m honest I think the pace is really run down and not worth a visit. Birds didn’t look great and especially the avary part where peacocks roam freely etc. The place was filthy. Yes birds are messy but when there are cafes near by etc it was full of poo and just felt old.

To top it off o sent my kids to buy bird food. Advertises $2. My son came back with 2 and no change. The guys don’t have change here be warned and stick the whole lot into a donation box. So it’s not actually $2 it was $5. Which isn’t a lot but isn’t the point and actually a lot for bird liquid they barely touch !

Sorry bird park I’m not wowed and it doesn’t take a lot to please me !"
,,Beautiful and well organised; not easy to get to. Bird lovers only!,5.0,,"Would dare say Jurong Bird Park is world class. Definitely schedule a visit if you're a bird lover. Make time for at least a half day, because it's far from town and airport. Wear comfy clothes and bring an umbrella because it will either be a hot and/or wet day.

Download a rideshare app like Grab or Gojek as they are probably the best way to get around without paying too much."
,,Family Park,5.0,,We had a fantastic moment in park.If can't book a tram and enjoy the view.Kids will enjoy a lot in the water park and dont forget to take clothes for them. You can also play if you are interested.
,,OUTSTANDING ATTRACTION,5.0,,"A great family and everyone's day out to experience unique and interesting birds from Asia, etc. Interesting at every turn. Don't miss this."
,,Amazing place for Bird lovers and for kids,5.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is a beautiful bird park with a wide variety of birds and different types of bird shows.
The tram ride inside the bird park is excellent as it takes you around the park and stops at the stations within the park so you can get down and click photos. It is a must visit attraction and it is value for money."
,,Went with kids,5.0,,during the december school holidays i took some kids to this attraction and all the kids really enjoyed the varieties of birds.
,,Wonderful place!,5.0,,"Wonderful Bird Park. Small, but with an excellent collection of birds. Excellent conditions for birds. Particularly admired collection of species of Macaw parrots. On the tracks of the parks you can meet leisurely iguanas. Be sure to visit this wonderful park!"
,,So beautiful,5.0,,I go to Singapore quite often because it's a beautiful and cheap holiday. Over all the years I have been to many places there and the best ones I go back to everytime the bird park is one of them. It is so beautiful and colourful my favorite place is in the big aviary with the large waterfall. Take lots of water as it gets hot and be prepared the penguin area smell cos of the fish. Have fun I do.
,,Recommend,5.0,,"Being from Tasmania, I dont get to see this range of birds ever, so this park for me was brilliant. The bird shows were amazing and I really appreciated the conservation message that was expressed as part of each bird show.
We had 6 hours and that was not enough time. I'll visit again next time I am here."
,,Outstanding Experience,5.0,,"For those travelers who have been to other Bird Parks...dont just go by the name. Its a treat to visit this park.
Very meticulously planned.
Buy tickets for Jurong park with tram ride.
There are 4-5 small blocks to be visited in the park. The tram has 4 stops and it takes you around. You can get down at any stop of your interest and visit that area.
Recommended method.
First sit in the tram and resist your temptation to get down at every stop.
See all the stops in one circuit and then get down to doing each segment one by one.
One section has a mini splash park for kids. Owing to the weather of Singapore, the kids are giong to love this.....but be careful....get into it only if you have a full day for the Park, else avoid it.
Recommended to start the tour in the morning and definitely dont miss the BIRD SHOW at the AMPHITHEATER. 11:00 & 3;00 pm everyday.
Worth a visit for all age groups.
Has a limited variety of restaurants also. For Indians, soth indian cuisine available in a restaurant just outside the park."
,,Flapping good,4.0,,took bus from Boon Lay early morning. Well laid out with walk-through aviaries where you can get close to the birds. Really enjoyed the ‘Lory Loft’ & Waterfall Aviary. Nicely maintained enclosures & informative signage. Unfortunately ran out of time to see any of the shows but would recommend a visit to any families or if you had 3-4hrs to spend.
,,"Loved this place, so interesting and a lovely place to walk around for the day",5.0,,"We had a lovely day here with our 4 year old. Beautiful aviaries, an opportunity to engage with some of the birds, and nice places to eat lunch. The shuttle tram service was a great option when little legs got tired. Tons of places to refill water bottles as you walk around.

I understand the bird park is moving next to the zoo in a couple of years. I hope the design will be in keeping with its current location. It was a nice place to walk around."
,,Old but amazing,5.0,,"I love the open and interactive concept of Singapore Bird Park. It the oldest wildlife park in Singapore, I have fond memories of my visits during school outings and I still enjoy the tranquil park 30 years later.

The birds look really happy, chirping away loudly with plenty of room to expand their wings in the aviary with many storeys high netting and lots of real matured trees and flowering plants. The parakeets, cockatoos, lories are not shy to fly down close to humans.

//In the mid- to late 1990s, staff realised they should not be making the birds do stunts that a human could do.

The birds were then trained to showcase their natural abilities instead, such as swooping above the audience's heads or engaging in cheeky banter with the presenter.//"
,,Loved it!,5.0,,We shared some very special moments in the Lory Loft. Those tiny birds wait to sip out of your cup. The beautiful colors and naughty nibling makes your heart want for more! Will definitely go back!
,,"Good place to visit, best attraction is the shows and covered bird park",3.0,,"Good place to visit, best attraction is the shows and covered bird park. It was very hot, so we did struggle to walk around. We enjoyed the shows and the area of the park which was enclosed."
,,Beauty of birds,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is an aviary and tourist attraction located on Jurong Hill. It is an excellent place for bird lovers. This well maintained park is the largest in Asia, and is home to over 5,000 birds, varying across 380 different species. It’s a bird’s paradise. They have interactive bird shows like ‘Kings of the skies’ showing prey animals and a Parrot show at the Pools Amphitheatre. Many more shows I guess which I couldn’t explore. These shows are a must watch for all ages as they are very entertaining. You can roam around the park on a tram which halts at stations designated for specific bird enclosure. You will need a whole day to view all that the park has to offer. Get mesmerized with the beauty of the colourful birds and catch them in action in their natural habitat."
,,Lorry loft,4.0,,"The shows are great, means we were surprised how they have taught this lil birds what a finishing performance. The Lorry loft area is just superb such an exciting nd thrilling experience. Kids will love even adults too."
,,Good but can be skipped as it is far,3.0,,Bird park is nice..maintained but it is very far from all main attractions. It takes your half day if you travel by public transport. Also there are no other attraction near by. Not many restaurants either. Birds are very beautiful and looks amazing in photos. but it depends on how much time you have in Singapore. If you are on tight budget and days then one can skip this.
,,Much better few years back,3.0,,It used to be one of my favorite places but I was disappointed this time. I did hear that they are moving the park to another location. There were very few birds in Lori Loft. Kids will love the shows.
,,Great but it was too hot,4.0,,Once should visit in pleasant season.. would not recommend in summer specially with 1 -2 years old baby. Otherwise it's great children may enjoy the bird show there
,,better than expected,4.0,,do not have that much to stay it was a pleasant experience not many queues friendly staff lots of cute birds .I would realllllllllly recommend getting the nectar it costs a dollar or two but when the bird sits o your hand the experience is worth it.the shows here too are pretty good.
,,Visit to Jurong Bird Park,3.0,,"I was surprise that the bird park wasn't as big as the zoo. If not for the Gutetama egghunt event, I would feel that the bird park didn't have much things to see and do."
,,Peaceful and quiet - but some parts need better maintanence,4.0,,"Compared to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, Jurong Bird Park is a much more peaceful trip, where more time can be spent watching the birds and getting up close. However, some parts of the park seem to require maintenance or upgrading, such as the penguin enclosure. The temperature seemed too warm for the enclosure and the enclosure itself, including the glass, seem dirty and not well looked after. I still don't see why such majestic penguins like the Emperor penguin should even be here in Singapore!

Overall, the other bird enclosures were decent. However, I don't think I will patronise it again. I'd rather the birds of prey and other large birds be released into the wilderness."
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,This is definitely one of the interesting place to visit when you are in Singapore. You won’t regret.
,,Really enjoyed watching the numerous species of birds.,5.0,,"We really enjoyed our visit to the Park. Although not a very big area, the Park kept many species of birds. Situation on a slope, taking the tram would save some walking. We also had lunch with the Parrots. The quality of food was average, but it saved us time looking for restaurants. The show was interesting and specially suitable for children. The carpark was big enough to cater its visitors. The visit left us a good impression of the park."
,,Must see park in Singapore,5.0,,"I traveled with my wife and 2 daughters. Earlier I thought what to see in bird park because most of the bird parks are common which I have seen in India. However this bird park is great and unique. Most admirable event is the bird show in this park which is really excellent. You can see all types of birds around the world including African penguin.

Must see this park and shows again, if i visit Singapore next time."
,,I'd wait until they move,3.0,,"Visited Jurong on our recent trip to Singapore. We were told on the way there that the park was moving to a site next to the Singapore Zoo in the next year. We felt that many of the birds were housed in enclosures that were difficult to see through. The Parrot exhibition was fabulous and modern but other enclosures were older style.
Staff were friendly and helpful and the birds we could see were great. Look forward to seeing their new home."
,,Visit to bird park,5.0,,A special kudos to the lovely water play area for the kids . Thoroughly enjoyed every visit to Jurong Bird Park
,,Get membership at the entrance!,3.0,,"The fun was marred by the fact that if only I had applied for membership at the entrance, I could have 10% discount on all food and drinks in the park."
,,Fascinating little birds,5.0,,"What an amazing collection of birds. Jurong bird Park is one of best tourist attractions Singapore has. It takes you around 5 to 6 hours to see the park in complete sense. Live shows are the highlights of this park. If you are visiting Singapore, do not miss Jurong :)"
,,healthy birds,5.0,,birds looks very healthy and natural environmental for the birds very cool place nice to visit with young children to learning for they studies and bird natures .
,,Not a bad experience,4.0,,Overall was good. Entrance fee still alittle too expensive . Even for locals.should make it more affordable for everyone.
,,Birding photos,1.0,,"Direction instruction bad and confusing. Exhibits inadequate,nothing much to excite. No eagles display. Lousy experience. Carpark small. Lack of proper instructions and road marshal at entrance to advise patrons that they can park in a different location. Road marshal just standing there I thought they were some restaurant helper. Not worth the money"
,,Incredible and fun,5.0,,My daughter like watch parrow talking and play water over there. It was worth can apply 1 year membership which we can unlimited to visit and visit again. See you my lovely penguin and miss you very much.
,,Enjoyable and friendly,5.0,,"Lots of Shelter , clean and tidy .. staff are friendly and willing to offer help. My 1yr old kid enjoy very much and would like to go again"
,,Fascinating bird zoo,5.0,,"I allocated 2 hours to visit the bird park. In the end, I ended up staying 3, and it was not enough. It is a fascinating zoo containing many birds roaming either in very big cages, or entirely freely. It was amazing to see very rare birds completely in the open and not flying away anywhere. Apparently, they must be well treated and well fed. There was also an enclosed area within which many birds could roam freely. They were very tame and used to humans. You could watch some rare birds from up close. Highly recommended, and I look forward to going again, but next time, I will allow a whole day."
,,Excellent place and must visit,5.0,,"This is an excellent place for bird lovers. Kids also enjoy penguin , eagle and parrot shows. You can explore park on mini tram without getting tired. The bird shows are great and very well presented and executed. Overall a must visit place in Singapore"
,,Morning well Spent,5.0,,"Since we bought the 4 park annual membership, we, Darling Jac, Daughter Mel and I decided to take full advantage of the unlimited entry passes.

We arrived at the bird park at 10 am, there weren’t many people around and of those who were there, they were mostly tourist.

Instead of planning a route like I always do... Jac ask why we needed to optimise the route.. “we have complimentary passes for a year” let just... WALK. Boss has spoken. Without putting any more thought into it.. we just headed off. I think we started near the exit.

We loved the enclosures, the smaller aviaries, I mean. Amazing.. had birds flying all around you as you walk through.. and there was one were you could even buy nectar water of some kind to feed the birds, which was really really nice.

Walking around we spent the good park of 4 hours at the park, and we didn’t even get to the waterfall aviary but we can come another time though.

It was an awesome morning spent and since it was past 2.30 pm already, with stomachs growling, we decided to bid a fond adieu..."
,,The best bird park in the world!,5.0,,"If you are interested in birds, it's a hole day experience - a huge and well maintained park with a lot of beautiful and exotic birds in nearly natural habitats! Amazing - and there is everything you need for your health :) How to get out easy to the park? - make it public! :) ""Take the East-West MRT line bound for Tuas Link, and alight at Boon Lay (EW27). From the Boon Lay bus interchange, take Bus No. 194, which will take you straight to Jurong Bird Park."" it's about 45 min. one way from the city"
,,Relaxing sun afternoon,4.0,,It was a fun and relaxing sun afternoon at Jurong Bird Park. Enjoy the stroll around the park and the High Flyers show.
,,The worst experience of jurong bird park,1.0,,Jurong bird park is a beautiful place but in terms of the employee of the tram they are the worst they people shout at customer if we ask them what we have to do at the stops and they don’t even guide there visitors the worst place in customer satisfaction is jurong park.
,,World of birds,4.0,,This Singapore wildlife bird Park is located in Jurong region. Place is well maintained with variety of world birds to watch in their almost natural habitat.
,,Bird lovers paradise,5.0,,"Our plan was to spend a morning at the bird park, but this changed shortly after our arrival as it became clear that we needed an entire day to fully enjoy the many and varied enclosures of this beautifully landscaped bird park. The tram enabled easy access around the park. It was well worth purchasing food for the birds at the Lory Loft and the Waterfall Aviary as this enhanced the experience. The High Flyers and Kings of the Skies shows were super. The breeding and research centre was most interesting. A fantastic day which even a thunderstorm could not ruin!"
,,Colorful birds and spectacular bird show,4.0,,Saw so many kinds of birds especially parrots. Took pictures with them. Waterfall aviary and birds/peacocks freely flying. We had to quietly go near them for a pic. Some would coolly pose for a pic and some would turn their face around and some flew away! The bird show was outstanding where they sang Happy birthday to you... said numbers 1 to 10 and also sang couple of chinese songs. Us and our parents enjoyed this place.
,,Very interesting place to visit for at least half a day,5.0,,"As a local, I only visit when there are visiting friends and they don't disappoint. The Entrance itself already features lots of eatery and well design garden and clean toilets, Upon entry, the penguin is just next to it on the right, where you can enjoy the cool aircondition away from the heat before or after the walk about.
Walking further in is where you buy the tram ticket, which is for whole day ride, priced at SGD $5 for adult and $3 for children. As this place is not as crowded as zoo, the wait is quick, only 4 stops and every stops deserve a visit.
Station 2 is where you can feed the birds, walk the hanging bridge, see horbill and their beautiful song, walking further down the road is the HUGE birds of prey, vultures and eagles.
Station 3 is a man made waterfall, you come in contact with birds and lots of peacock roaming around you, just keep your kids hand to themselves please.
Station 4 is where you visit the beautiful parrots, touted as the only one in the world, their call is loud and you may even get to hear them speak. walking further down is the flamingo valley, at least a hundred of them standing together.
The timing not to miss are the feeding of birds of prey 10am and 4pm, feeding of penguin 10:30am and 3:30pm, bird show at 3 and 4pm, parrot show at 1pm. Sorry I am not too sure about the timing, please check with the park rangers at the park.
So your kids can enjoy bird feeding and penguin feeding, don't miss visiting during the right hour.
There are cafe and pizza place plus indian restaurants around the bird park, feel free to visit empty stomach and eat there, water fountain are plenty, so no risk of dehydration."
,,Jurong Bird Park deserves more than tweets,4.0,,"This is our second visit and if we visit again in 3 years time, we were told by our Grab driver, that the Singapore government intends to consolidate the attractions - Jurong Bird Park, the Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari into just one location - to give visitors more time to take in the park instead of wasting time traveling from one location to another.
And the birds - from the prey to those at play - are always a pleasure to see and hear. Surely Jurong is not just for the birds."
,,One of the finest Bird parks,5.0,,Undoubtedly the best I have seen n well maintained park; hats off for the caring of the birds and the show of birds is the best at 11 n 330pm..a lesson for all that we really need to care for the environment around us - give trees and nature a chance to survive in this competitive world ; Singapore has done well to send out a positive message with their upkeep n variety intact.
,,Thoroughly enjoyable,5.0,,"Birds, birds and more birds! We were wondering if there would be something to see for more than 2 hours and we were so wrong! Once can spend a day entirely in this bird park. The park itself is spread across a huge area and is divided into bird exhibits from various parts of the world.

The enclosures are not suffocating for the birds and in many of those enclosures, you can actually get inside to spot the birds, some of them friendly and some shy away. It is a fun exercise to do with young children.

Birds not to miss
- Penguins at the entrance (I felt a bit of pity to see that they had the least space as it requires cooling)
- Lory Loft
- Hornbills an Toucans
- High flyers Show (at 11:00am in the Pools Amphitheater)
- Waterfall Aviary - Definitely a Must See
- Parrot Paradise

Make sure to take the Tram ticket as it can be convenient to go from one place to another at times

Plan to spend at least 4 hours (Including the show) and if you are with kids who are excited add some more time as there is also a play area"
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,Amazing Bird Park with a good variety of species from different parts of the world. Lories were a favourite. Friendly and used to visitors so they are happy to sit on your hand for a photo opportunity. About sng $14 via taxi from the city. Note this park is soon moving to a new larger complex next to Singapore Zoo.
,,Locals should visit too!,5.0,,"The last time I went to the Bird Park was around 25 years ago... back then, I was unimpressed with the place, preferring the Singapore Zoological Gardens (which I loved as a child then).

25 years later, I'm back with a little bub of my own who loves birds, and I am very impressed with how much the park has changed since then. The bird shows were fun, with interactive segments. There's a water playground -- a favourite with children, so bring your swimsuits, sunblock & a change of clothes! You can actually walk around the whole park with some rest in between, but it can get very hot, so purchasing those tram tickets can help those with movement challenges / elderly / with babies. For parents, bring your strollers, the paths are generally wide & flat - although there's a few exhibits where you'll need to fold-up your stroller and carry it up some stairs and/or the paths are narrower and it's just easier to park your stroller outside & carry your kid around.

Unless you're a bird fanatic, half a day will be adequate for covering all the exhibits. Pack your own lunches, there're sitting areas with tables where you can have a picnic, though bear in mind that many are unshaded. There're water refill stations all around, so bring your own water bottles."
,,Best bird park in Asia,5.0,,Excellent place to spot the rarest & exquisite bird species at one place...blue macque...hornbills...penguines...the bird shows are excellent...be sure to catch them...take the tram ticket for easy conveyence inside the park...must visit in Singapore
,,Pretty and Handsome Helpful Staff,4.0,,Very helpful and eager to guide. Surely will come again.Did a wrongful transaction and they gave me a refund. They did it cheerfully. Well done guys.
,,Kids loved it,4.0,,"This is the second time we have visited this park, once 12 years ago without kids, and recently with 2 children. While the park hasn’t changed much in 12 years it is still a great, affordable day out."
,,Better than I expected,5.0,,"I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the park and the number of birds that were visible.

Having been to other bird parks, you are often left searching the enclosure for 1 bird who happens to be sleeping or hiding.

The flamingos were wonderful, so to the pelicans and then the hornbills.. just wonderful.

Apart from those, there were so many other birds you could get up close in person to, especially the parrots with kids holding nectar.. oh yeah, some big kids too.

The breeding and weaning display was great and it was cool that they had everything from penguins through to eagles.

I thoroughly lovely visit."
,,So much to see!,4.0,,Bring your walking shoes and make sure you have lots of water because there is so much to see! Don't miss the waterfall aviary!
,,Disappointing at the Easter event and improvement needed in up keeping the facility.,3.0,,"It had been awhile since we visited the bird park, we were disappointed at the Easter event, we reached the park at 11:20am and found our that the event supposed to start at 10am already out of colouring paper for the kids. We saw many disappointed faces from the little kids, we saw the event organiser argued with the parents when they asked for more details.
We heard that the park will be moving soon, maybe that's why the up keep of the park is poor, the ponds look dirty and many cages are empty. It is not a place that we would like to visit again."
,,Highly Recommend Bird's Eye Tour,5.0,,"Our family booked the Jurong Bird Park Bird's Eye Tour (BET). It was an amazing, memorable and meaningful experience and all of us love it. We were brought around the park in a buggy by our friendly guide. We had up-close, hands-on experience with the various birds (feel, hold and feed hornbill, vultures, brahminy kites, owl and baby bird in breeding center). Our guide and the bird handlers are very friendly and we can feel the enthusiasm and passion that they have in caring for the birds. The birds at the Jurong Bird Park are very well taken care and very beautiful. We highly recommend the Bird's Eye Tour."
,,Good experience: huge and confusing place,4.0,,"This is huge bird park with some trained birds those were showed in show sessions, Penguins are there too. 34 S$ entry fee."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Fantastic place to visit! Shows are amazing. Great family day out. Highly recommend the tram if the heat gets too much!
,,A Must Visit For Kids,5.0,,"This was our 3rd and 4th Visit in as many as 3 years. I didn't think the kids would still love going there as much but they did and the biggest reason is the Penguins they love the Penguins Enclosure and the Penguin Feeding makes it unique and memorable for the kids. The park will be moving soon to Join the rest of the Wildlife Reserves but for now it's in Jurong, unfortunately there is no way to get here direct with the MRT but you can get a bus from the MRT we went from Boon Lay. The park is amazing clean well maintained the Birds are well looked after there is also a small Water Play area which the Kids loved. They also have some great shows The High Flyers club is a really fun show. If it's your first time visiting Singapore this is a must visit place."
,,Creation,3.0,,"Birds were created to fly, wings were created for this purpose. Seeing then in cage gave a sense of sadness in our hearts. Just to get public and spectators for the profit of building a park, these birds' freedom was sacrificed."
,,Good experience,4.0,,The tram Q was super long and it's very humid. It will be good to install more fans. But we do love the tram ride and they really ensure safety! We were able to eat our lunch and watch the Parrot show!
,,Amazing Journey with Kid,5.0,,"It's perfect place for kids visiting. Various kinds of birds, not only showing, also having some knowledge introduction. And the tour route is designed well, worth a half day visiting."
,,Great experience for Kids and adults,4.0,,I was mesmerized to see so many different species of birds. They not only take care of these birds but even hatch new species. The penguins were a delight to watch. Do not miss the parrot bird shows. They are a must.
,,Poor parrots. Lucky Loris,3.0,,Came here for a day this week. Generally a pleasant although “old school” experience especially the high flying bird show and especially the parrot that could sing in three languages. Impressive stuff. The Loris loft was also very good with good flying space for the...More
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,The day well spent with Birds. The Park is clean and nicely designed. The birds are well trained for the shows and the team is taking almost care of them.
,,Great experience for adults and children,5.0,,The park was enjoyable and educational. Don’t forget to visit the gift shop for interesting souvenirs
,,Visit to bird park,5.0,,The place is huge but not confusing to explore. Elderlies and children can opt to ride the tram if they find walking too tiring.There are some sections where there are no barriers between you and the birds. Such a pleasant experience!
,,Looking a bit tired but still well worth the trip,4.0,,"Obviously nearing its closure, this is still a worthwhile trip for bird lovers. We watched and enjoyed the High Flyers show, especially the parrot singing in three languages! The monorail is long gone ,and I would agree with other reviewers who say the tram stops...More"
,,Bird park for families,5.0,,Jurong bird park vist was very informative and interesting tourist place. The shows performed during day share lot of information on birds lifecycle. Don't miss the hawk show and suggest to take the tram.
,,A great aviary experience,4.0,,"An enthralling experience from witnessing the power of birds of prey to the gimmicks and uncanny intelligence of macaws and hornbills, the bird park is a satisfying journey for the young and old alike."
,,Birds and Birds,5.0,,Totally worth visiting as the vibrant colourful birds will take you closer to nature. Ultimate beauty of Nature
,,Wonder full Bird Park,5.0,,"I had been to Jurong Bird park last month and had wonderful time . You need 4-5 Hrs to complete it
Its advisable first to take full ride tram and then hop off & on anywhere you want . Shows are not to be missed as they are very informative and good
Remember to carry a bottle for water and wear light clothes that suits the weather.
travelled via MRT to nearest station and then took a bus ... it was very comfortable
you will need full day 6-7 hrs (incl travel time) at ease if you wish to cover entire park at leisure
staff is super helpful and friendly"
,,"Don't skip this, if you are running short of time skip the zoo and other safaris",5.0,,"Jurong Bird park is worth visiting here is why -
1. It has a lot of interesting Birds and ease is accessibility
2. The Birds are housed in large enclosures and you get to feed them
3. The park staff is very friendly and helpful
4. The shows are good too and dont miss them

Cons:
1. Veg food is a big problem here, however you can carry your own stuff
2. Singapore weather is extremely humid making it hard to walk even few meters
3. By taking the tram you cannot skip the walking part, you will still need to get off and do the walking to see all attractions.

Typically it is a half day event with a bit of walking to do, if you got kids make sure you carry a stroller - the whole park is stroller friendly."
,,It's no longer the same as I last visited,2.0,,Perhaps the birds are in the midst of transiting to the new combined sanctuary with Mandai. So many cages are emptied. Lesser Birds are in the free flying enclosures.
,,Staff not well informed.,2.0,,"I approach the Usher and ask how to purchase ticket online. After I done, she told me to get the ticket from the ticket counter which I had q up for 15min till my turn, then the counter staff said actually not necessary to q, as the ticket is in my email. If the asher had inform me earlier, my family and I would not be wasted our good 15 min for nothing... I feel very frustrated and the weather was so hot at that time...."
,,For Bird Photographers,5.0,,"Excellent to take photos of plenty of birds living in the enclosed forest. Big zoom lens is optional, i.e. normal zoom is enough :)"
,,A day well spent...,5.0,,Had a great time at the park with my Niece...and thoroughly enjoyed the show..which was information and entertainment at the same time...
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,Good experience. It takes almost 3 to 4 hours to complete the tour. I will suggest to view the penguines first and then take a tram ride to decide which part of the park you want to visit first. There are wide variety of birds in the park. Take your dslr camera if you have one to get close pictures of variety of birds. The shows here are also a not to be missed thing.
,,Educational fun outing,5.0,,"Good educational trip for children. Start off w birds of prey show....vultures, hawks etc all at close range. Another show w parrots toucans, talking parrots etc is another enjoyable eye opener. Feeding birds w live worms at waterfall open avairy, and feeding lories w nectar n honey water in plastic cups are must do activities. Round off w kids at water playground (swimwear is a must)."
,,Need to put out a bird spotting book,4.0,,"Buy the tram ticket at the gate unless you are able bodied and enjoy hills.
Get in on opening up to the Lory enclosure to feed nectar in the monster aviary and plan on spending a lot of time in the waterfall aviary spotting the birds.
Great half day out which could easily be a full one for bird enthusiasts.
If you require sustenance avoid the curry gardenn -it’s not very clean, lacklustre service and watered down flavours"
,,Had a wonderful day at the Bird Park,5.0,,You can easily spend a day at the Jurong Bird Park. Many different species of birds. The colorful birds are amazing. At the walk in Aviary the birds would fly on my shoulders of people’s arms. So friendly. I highly recommend this activity for visitors.
,,Fun to see the different birds but a bit expensive,4.0,,"My friends wanted to come here, I was not very keen to go along at first but it turned out a lot better than I thought. It was really fun to see all the different types of birds but it is quite expensive to go there."
,,NICE BIRD PARK,5.0,,"WHILE IT WAS HOT, walking through the park was very interesting and fun to see all of the different types of birds. The park was spacious and if you like birds you definitely want to visit the Bird Park"
,,Really Enjoyed,5.0,,"Many Aviaries with many birds, different themes based on continents, Staff takes great care of birds, v informative. Really enjoyed and would love to visit again."
,,The best bird park in the world,5.0,,They have large variety of different birds in the park. They have different live shows showing in the morning and afternoon. The birds come from all parts of the world.
,,One of the World's best Bird Parks,5.0,,"An excellent experience, with all the residents obviously VERY well cared for! All the staff were very helpful and well informed, and a special mention for Nara, the Curator of their Jewels of the Jungle aviary - just the sort of dedicated wildlife expert the smaller topical Parrots love! Expect to spend a full day here, since there is a large area to cover and lots to see."
,,"Very friendly staff, ready for revamp",3.0,,"My artist friends and I went on an event coupon I had for the park. We stayed the entire day, and interacted with the staff when they noticed the sketches we drew, as well as after watching the Kings Of The Skies performance. The staff were very personable, sharing each bird's name and their unique antics, and enriched our experience. The Lory Loft was our favorite exhibit where one could walk with a cup of nectar for lories to feed from, right on your hand. Just beware of their droppings.
The staff made up for the worn down architecture and finishings of the location. The bird's cages were necessary but also felt restrictive after visiting the open habitats of the Zoo and Night Safari. The Bird Discovery Centre's aircon was also shut off and made the area very stuffy. The revamp for the Bird Park can't come soon enough."
,,Rather disappointed,3.0,,"Easy to get to using the train and bus. Entry was $35; bring your boarding pass or passport for a 10% discount or even try to remember your flight number (I couldn't ). A huge area to cover by foot, it is also rather hilly and tiresome on a hot day. We decided to purchase a $5 ticket for the hop on/off tram. It has about 5 designated stops and passes many important exhibits, that if you wish to see, you would have to walk back to. We didn't as it meant too much walking up and down hills. Alot of birds were not visible in their cages, but the flamingos were a sight to behold."
,,Must See if you Like Birds,5.0,,"During our stay, becoming a member was only a few dollars more than a day pass so we did that and actually came here twice. The staff are well trained, polite and helpful. The park itself is in top condition and the birds look healthy and well cared for. Within the argument about weather any animal should be kept in captivity there is the thought that by teaching people about a species they might take that knowledge away and the wild animals end up being treated better... lets hope that’s true. A very enjoyable place to visit."
,,So nice,4.0,,A very nice Bird park with an impressive amount of birds in all sorts. We were magnified by all the different toucans and their impressive facilities. We could easily spend more hours in this park even though we were there for 5 hours with 3 kids under 6 years of age. The only really bad comment we have concerns the conditions of the water play area. This was really not worth a visit.
,,Jurong Bird Park,3.0,,"we were three me,my wife and my daughter.Jurong Bird Park in Singapore is the world's largest bird park. This is the one of main tourist attraction in singapore . there are many kind of birds. The harest thing is the weather .I felt like I hold iron on my back when I move from place to other. This place is beatiful for families with you children."
,,Jurong Bird Park Singapore,4.0,,"WE travelled by train and bus to Jurong Bird Park on a Friday which was great as it was not crowded. We caught the train to Boon Lay and then Bus 194 from the bus terminus in the adjacent shopping mall, Bus 194 takes you directly to the Bird Park and you catch the same Bus (194) back from the same spot where you alighted. Allow several hours to wander around the park to witness all the birds in a simulated natural habitat. We were lucky to arrive just on feeding time (9:30am approximately) for the penguins, there is also Eagle demonstrations and other bird feeding. It is very easy to get photos with Birds. The disappointment is the food available, basic at best. If you enjoy seeing a vast array of Birds then you should enjoy the experience"
,,Not organised,2.0,,"Don't know where to start and where to end, maps looks easy but not easy to follow. Tend to miss out few places and its very far apart. Overall nothing much to be impress or to come back."
,,Zoo has more to see,1.0,,We had 4 adults visiting this park honestly can say we were all a little disappointed with this visit I found the zoo to offer just as good. The bird show was about the best part.
,,"Birds, Birds",4.0,,Very colourful range of birds. They will come to you and photos easy as they are super friendly use to crowds
,,A relaxing green park,4.0,,A relaxing park for 2-3 hrs walking and sweat out. The surrounding with lots of green and clean. The show are interactive. Bring along swimming suit for kids as the wet & dry playground is a good place for them to beat the heat.
,,Very unique,5.0,,"I had never visited a bird park before (only an open air netted aviary) and was glad that I visited the one in Jurong. It is a bit difficult to get to as it is one of the corners of Singapore but going there was totally worth it. The bird shows were amazing, especially the one where they made of pelicans do a show. We saw a lot of unique variety of birds."
,,As good as I hoped,5.0,,"I'm not the biggest bird person, but me and my kids had a good, memorable time here. We went to two bird shows, had our pictures taken holding birds and got to feed penguins. We also enjoyed the aviary and butterfly area. Make sure you go the the bird aviary, the place is huge and very nice."
,,An attraction that I had missed all these years,4.0,,"This was my fourth visit to Singapore but some how i had never found time to visit this park thinking it was something for children.
This visit was really an eye opener. This park is a great attraction. You not only see so many exotic birds like penguins, flamingos, vultures, colourful macaus etc
but you learn so much about them. The short shows like penguin feeding, vulture shows etc are very informative.
The high flyers show is the best for both children and adults.
The ride on the toy train is also a great entertainment and a good way to have a general view of the park and the inmates."
,,verity of birds and the specility,5.0,,Amazing place we saw lot of verity of birds in one place. and very important things We can access toilet and drinking water all the side of the park very neat and clean.
,,Beautiful..,5.0,,The Bird park is excellent . Especially the opportunity to take pictures with parrots and paraquats.
,,Sorry to see it go,4.0,,"JBP is a place that will always be special to me. It houses a fantastic collection of birds, and makes a good effort to allow visitors to interact closely and learn more about the birds. I hope that the new venue will further improve the place."
,,Heaven for bird lovers,4.0,,"Despite being out of the way, this is still one of the best place for bird watching. Lovely environment created for birds."
,,Excellent day in Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"The park is great, beautiful vegetation and lots and lots of birds. We saw one show and the whole family was amazed to witness a parrot talking. Excellent service as always in SG Strongly recommend it."
,,Another ‘must do’ whilst in Singapore,5.0,,Well laid out with a good variety of birds from around the world including penguins (in Singapore!). A netted area for seeing birds flying around is a good way of interacting with the birds and is also very well kept to make it feel like you are in the environment the birds would naturally be in.
,,Beautiful bird park....an amazing experience,5.0,,"Jurong bird park is a must see at Singapore. it is well connected by public transport.. Got WiFi and good eat outs there to cater for all cuisines.
The shows there - Raptors and Macaus should not be missed.. The timings are available on their web site..
The best part is the Lory loft.. You can have the beautiful birds come and sit on your shoulder, arms and head too!!
Water for drinking is available at dispensers ... You can refill your bottles there...so you are not forced to buy bottles.
The water park for kids is amazing..make sure to carry swimming costume and clothes change for kids.... This applies to all the attractions..Zoo, Gardens by the bay too...
A lovely place to spend time with kids and family.."
,,A must for bird lovers.,4.0,,This place is easy to access on the MRT and then a bus from the interchange. There are lovely gardens at the entrance in true Singapore style. We were entertained with the bird show. The walk-in aviary was a delightful experience and a lot of the birds were quite close and easy to see. Watch out for the weaver birds flying in and out of their hanging nests. We enjoyed this place.
,,Best Bird Park,5.0,,"Jurong bird park is the best in the world, according to me. I was amazed to see the collection of exotic birds this zoo houses.

What’s even more appealing is that you get to feed some birds on your own. If you’re allergic to them, kindly keep away since you would be surrounded with hundreds of birds to get the feed from you. It will try getting over you from the front & behind.

You could also get to click a picture with some exotic/rare birds but it comes at a cost. If you don’t mind spending money, do go for it. You cannot have it clicked on your camera or mobile."
,,One of my favourite places to visit in Singapore,5.0,,This is the one place that I try and visit in Singapore every time I go there. While Australia has some great bird parks which I love the Jurong Bird Park has to be my favourite. You can spend hours hear and not get fed up.
,,A very nice place to visit,5.0,,"Although this park is well out of the city, it was easy to travel there and back by taxi. We very much enjoyed our visit, including the live show. There is a good variety of colourful birds."
,,"Better call it ""A Park with Birds""",4.0,,"Years ago, we visited the Park for the first time and were deeply impressed. This time, we were surprised how much trees and bushes had grown ad how the park was reshuffled. It is nice to make the train trip once around the area - but there is not much to see as far as birds are concerned. We must admit that we did not attend any performance - we just visited the different sections of the park.
It is nice that the bus stops in front of the Park upon arrival - but return to town is a little tricky although logical (one-way roads). We saw beautiful birds although the green is dominating. The Park is. recommendable for people without foot problems - the little train is of some help but not too much. Younger children might become very tired."
,,best pace or kids,5.0,,You just cant experience by words. Just take a visit and be happy. Good pace for both kids and elders
,,Just Amazing!!,5.0,,"This a must do if you are in Spore & if you are travelling with Kids. A bit far from the city centre but it has a lot to offer. There are many a kind of species of birds, You can find peacocks roaming on the pathway along with you. Must see are the Penguins there are many kinds of it. Also, do not miss the Pools Amphitheatre its amust see show daily 3:30 Pm"
,,Dont miss!!,5.0,,"This is actually situated in an industrial area. The bird park is quite vast and takes about an hour or two to complete the entire tour of the park. The kids will love the park. There are walk through aviaries and you can see birds flying past you. If you reach there by the feeding time, then you might be lucky to have them fed from your hands. From Flamingoes to Eagles, the bird park boasts of many species."
,,The kids will love it,4.0,,Its a standard bird park not too big but the kids love it for the birds shows and other attractions where you can touch the birds and get urself clicked with them
,,Good place to spend 3-4 hours,4.0,,Good place for bird lovers.Place is not that big but good enough for 3-4 hours .Dont miss their shows which happens at 10 and 11 in morning.Worth watching shows.
,,Well run; animals well-tended,5.0,,"I generally don’t like zoos (I despise seeing animals in cages), but this zoo treats the animals very well. The aviaries are enormous, and most of the birds are in open-air parks. It is also very efficiently paved, so that one doesn’t have to walk overmuch to see all the exhibits (especially useful on hot days). I probably spent more time there than most visitors, and I still finished the whole park in about four hours."
,,Beautiful but changes needed,3.0,,"I felt a little conflicted coming here because I hate the thought of birds in cages but I have never before seen a park dedicated to purely to such an array of birds.

Get there early, definitely by taxi (approx $25 rush hour time from Clarke Quay way) and enjoy having the park to yourself for a while. The highlights were by far the shoebills and the wide variety of hornbills. They do need bigger enclosures as do the birds of prey. The walk in aviaries were an wonderful experience, especially birds of asia and the waterfall aviary - these do seem the right size for the birds they have flying around. The penguins however looked very desolate and is much need of an expansion and upkeep.

I went to the high flyers show, I really didn't like the ending which I know should be the highlight but there had so many birds on stage thought it probably was a stressful experience for birds involved. Keepers however handled them well and were enthusiastic in explaining about protecting birds' environments.

I spent abut 4 hours here as I loved viewing each type of bird, you never get this opportunity to see the size of some of them or hear what they sound like flying around and talking. However I couldn't help thinking that the quality of life for some of the birds particularly was really poor given their enclosure size. They probably could do with more information signs to go with their endangered level and how the park is supporting their conservation and expanding some of the enclosure sizes.The same could probably be said of alot of zoos and likely comes with the nature of attraction trying to balance out quality vs public being able to see them"
,,Great exhibits and excellent shows. If you enjoy zoos then it's definitely worth a visit.,5.0,,"A really enjoyable experience at Jurong Bird Park. The highlight was the High Flyers Show, complete with talking parrots and flying hornbills. The kids loved it. Some exhibits are better than others (my favourite was the birds of prey), but there are lots of nice touches like the Bird Discovery Centre and the large aviary with natural waterfall. And, being Singapore, there's a water park for the kids to play in at the end of the day.

The only downsides are (1) having to pay extra to ride the tram; it's not too expensive but should probably just be included in the price of entry, and (2) the location is not that convenient so you are better off catching a taxi there if you don't have a car."
,,GREAT BIRD ZOO AND A MUST SEE.,4.0,,"24 Feb, 2019 we went to the Jurong Bird Zoo., Singapore. The first thing we found out that the discounted seniors price advertised only applies to Singapore residents all other countries pay full price.
We paid the extra five dollars for the tram ride. At station one we were told to take a seat because we are disabled. We waited for ages and still told to take a seat. After waiting for a long time we got up and walked off. They ignored us.
The bird show happens twice a day and we watched that. A show not to be missed. Very well done.
The park is well set out and if you can get the tram to high spots and walk back down looking at all the enclosures. There are shops and food outlets around the park and plenty of rest rooms/toilets around the park.
They also have water bottle refill stations at the tram stops.
There are a vast number of birds on display and in the middle a fantastic water park for the children. Bring their costumes and towels.
The walk in enclosures gets you up and close to the birds.
It takes about 4 hours to see it all and well worth it.
Bus tours turn up in the morning but they are gone by lunch time.
In 2020 the park allegedly moves to the Singapore Zoo we were told.
A special thanks to Annie in the shop at the Kids Water Park and Sun Win who works with her. Annie was great in serving up and is a credit to the Bird Park. Well done.
Overall it is a great half a day experience that is not to be missed."
,,Good place to visit if you are love birds,4.0,,"Travelled in Jan2019.

Pros - Very systematic layout, Map was given to us during entry.All road signs ,directions on road inside were clear.We have attended two bird shows .They were good!.The tram to was really useful to travel inside.Facilities like washrooms ,drinking water were available at all sites.Penguins were also one of the main attractions.

If you are bird lover then you should spent at least 4-5 hours

Cons - This attraction was since so many years ,we observe marks of deterioration in cages, structures."
,,Nice Bird Park,4.0,,The Jurong Bird Park is on a hillside in the northwestern part of Singapore. Really liked the aviaries where you could walk inside and the birds were free to fly around. The areas with cages were far less nice. This park is moving locations in 2020 and hopefully they will have more aviaries and less cages there.
,,Dropped in Quality and cleanliness,3.0,,"I am a visitor of Singapore for the past 15 years and normally visit the locations more than once.

The bird park during my first visit 2003 was fantastic and it was great fun, lots of variety very well taken care of. This time I had the feeling the park is not well maintained and could use some extra care. The variety was less and the place generally felt old.

Still there are a few excellent shows but not up to the standard of my previous visits this is my 4th one.

Again timing of the visit will make a lot of difference.

Best way to get here is the taxi the SMRT arrives to a near by area and then you can take the bus but the journey is way too long....."
,,good park but horrible restaurants,3.0,,the park itself was nice. a lot of birds definitely worth seeing but some of them were caged which is reasonable however the fence don’t have to be so dark and cramped you can’t even see the birds inside! what’s horrible are the restaurants there. no halal certified restaurants for muslims unlike singapore zoo. they did claim that some of them have no park no lard but the food was terrible. why can’t they have nice and decent quality food like singapore zoo provides? definitely need to improve on that if they want to attract tourists & have returning customers or else it would be a one time visit and never again.
,,Ticket is too expensive for the birds in the park.,3.0,,TIcket was very expensive that too during public holidays. Shall be less price atleast for locals. Can improve.
,,"When you love birds, this is definitely a place you must visit!",4.0,,"This is a stunning park, some of the birds are almost so close that you can touch them. Some of the cages are definitely in need for a reforming and too small for some birds! But overall this was a wonderful park and i enjoy it from the beginning till the end of my visit!"
,,A wonderful experience,5.0,,"The Jurong Birds Park visit has been most enjoyable
Great selection of birds from all over the world in a park with beautiful landscape
Easy to walk but if required the tram service is very good and is going frequently around all the attractions
The different shows are a must and very educational to learn about the different kind of animals
We enjoyed most the Hawks Eagel and Voucher show
We ha a great day"
,,Best place,5.0,,Welcoming staff.. 😊😊..feeding bird is very nice attraction. Kids will enjoy a lot. Also small water park is add on for young children while Adults can get rest for sometime
,,mixed impression,3.0,,"First the positive:
Under the nets the enclosures in which the birds could fly freely were very beautiful.
The negative:
In the cages to keep the birds in which they can not or hardly fly is animal cruelty and not beautiful. Here would be less = more. That means about 1/3 fewer birds show that they make cages 3 times bigger"
,,Jurong Bird Park,3.0,,"Our experience was good. What stood out was the lush greenery, clean maintenance, courteous staff and the bird shows.
We (me and my wife) were a little sad about keeping the birds in captivity.
We generally feel this, wherever animals or birds, generally any species are kept in captivity.
We wish this would stop, the world over.
We wish all places, including the Jurong park, where animals are kept in captivity, would close down.
We know this is asking too much.
We know you are there in it for money and not for kindness to animals. But since you asked our views, we gave it."
,,Shows,4.0,,overall experience is good. all the show is very nice. nice photo spot. etc. varieties of paratos. good
,,My daughter enjoys it.,4.0,,My daughter enjoys the two bird shows. Also feeding the flamingoes. It could be better if there is more food outlets. Currently there is only small pizza outlet near the main entrance. It will be quite far for the visitors who walks around the park. But the park really makes the visitors enjoy the natire and the free roaming birds exhinits
,,Still great but on the decline,4.0,,"Not sure if it’s because they are moving soon but it is clear that the bird park, while still a great concept, no longer receives the degree of care it once had. Many cages are empty. The facilities are not always clean. The shows do not have the same quality (or attendance). Unfortunately, this park is aging. I hope the move will help give it a boost."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Lovely place to take your kids. Make sure to catch the bird shows. The penguin feeding is also fun! A lovely place to be in. Much smaller than other attractions which means there's much much less walking to do. You can rent buggies, strollers etc for a very small price. It's beautifully maintained with some amazingly friendly staff. Their dedication is just simply amazing!"
,,Well worth the journey,5.0,,"We travelled 1 1/2 hours each way by metro and bus, but it was well worth the trip. There are an amazing collection of colourful birds, well set out. There is a tram available to take you from area to area. Apparently the park is to be moved to the zoo site over the next 12 months."
,,Wow!,4.0,,"Visited here on our first day in Singapore – hotel staff suggested a taxi as it would be quite a trek by train and bus otherwise. Glad we did as it really wasn’t expensive by taxi and an awful lot cooler!
The park is amazing – hundreds of varieties of birds from all over the world, many of which are critically endangered or on the verge of extinction in their natural habitats. Be warned it is huge, with some ‘must sees’ too – ours were the waterfall aviary, wings of Asia and parrot paradise, but we are slightly biased as we are hyacinth macaw fans!
The High Flyers show was great although we were very concerned as to the number of group tours there, but they seemed to ‘disappear’ after the show so guess they were on a ‘whirlwind tour’ of Singapore which included a couple of hours here.
We took our time – we are animal and bird enthusiasts – we sat regularly and also drank plenty as it got hotter as the day went on. Including eating lunch (but not visiting the kids play park) we spent five hours here!
Would we return – you bet!
Oh and the staff were great too – helpful, polite and informative!"

,,Guides by Arshley the Bird Champion,5.0,,"I and my husband just returned back from Singapore trip where we happened to visit Jurong Bird Park away from our busy schedule and to our very best we were extremely happy for what we got to see especially with the help of Arshley Brian who challenged us with the wide knowledge he had on different birds.
Arshley was our guide and its so unfortunate that his just orienting with the bird park for two weeks then he goes back to his country,
He was our very best guide around with a unique hand of care,His one of the Guides in Uganda and to me I would definitely recommend him for your Ugandan Safari,his a young brilliant man and very passionate about what he does.
If you're visiting Singapore soon don't hesitate to ask for Arshley Brian.
He will create memories for you in just a short spell of visiting the Bird Park.
Jurong Bird Park is a good place to see a lot of world bird species in a short time."
,,Good,4.0,,"A well maintained park with wide variety of birds, saw two shows, both were good , saw penguin feeding session too , that was ok ( bit lengthy) tram ride is nice and exciting, overall a good day to spend whole day, kids will enjoy it"
,,Exploring places to bring the twins,4.0,,"Decided that it’s been waaaay too Long since I have last gone to the Jurong Bird Park.
Brought the twins there for a day out and I must say, although it seemed a bit smaller than I remembered, it still was a nice day out.
The show was still fun.
The residents there were still beautiful.
Lots to see.
And there is even a water park (free!)
Pity it was a bit too hot for the babies.
Nevertheless, still quite fun and the twins had a great time!"
,,Pace yourself,4.0,,"We went to see the morning show first, which was very good, but the queues for the tram afterwards was very long so maybe not a good idea. We really enjoyed the waterfall aviary and the Lorie aviary where you can get close to the birds. Pelicans, parrots, penguins, flamingos, owls, eagles, so many different breeds of birds it really is worth a visit."
,,Funtime!!,4.0,,We visited the bird park with our 3 year old daughter.We were there on the Christmas.We reached the park early just around the opening hours and it was the best thing to do.We were the early few to enter and so there was no rush..we could get a place easily in the trams and the shows( yes it's a long walk for the 3 yrs old )...v managed to see all the shows and the shows are fantastic.There is water park and a play area for the kids which was a added bonus...my daughter totally enjoyed...the variety of birds is also great! In short it's a great place to visit with younger kids.
,,So so..,3.0,,Not that big but do have quite a lot of varieties of bird. Little bit stink due to the bird drops. So far flamingo is the best.
,,Delightful!,4.0,,"If you love birds or have kids who do, this is a must-see. The colourful parrots display welcome you then the graceful flamingoes in the lake.
There’s a tram with 3 stops to bring you around.
The Lorie aviary with hand feeding was spectacular with very hungry eager lories landing on your arm and even head.
The vulture and big bird section is impressive.
We went during the festive period and got a one year unlimited ticket for the price of a one day ticket. Such a lovely surprise and great value! We are already planning our next visit."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I have been to Singapore 3 times and every time I go to Jurong Bird Park, it is easily the best place in Singapore and never gets boring! The staff are very kind and very smart, If you have never been or even if you have you need to go!"
,,A must see attraction in Singapore,5.0,,This was my 4th visit to the bird park and I'm still not tired of it. Not just for young kids this is amazing for adults as well. The High flyers show and Lory Loft are the very best not to mention the signature Toucan
,,joyful time,5.0,,luckily we were on time for bird show (11 am) which was awesome. a peaceful place to spend quality time with nature
,,Good entertainment for the family,4.0,,"Good park to visit with your family, count around 3-4 hours for the whole park. very hot and himid, you are outdoors the whole time, so no AC at all. in some places of the park, the smell of birds is very strong. The perrots section is the best, very colorful!"
,,JBP,3.0,,"It started pretty well, some eateries before entering the park. Penguin enclosure was quite impressive. We missed the penguin feeding time. Followed by a tram ride as the walk was quite up slope n pretty hot weather. Along the way there were some enclosures but viewing is limited,recommend on foot. 1st stop lory loft Station. Open enclosure with free flying lorries. U can buy lorries nectar n feed them up close n get nice photos. In house photographers available on site. Pretty expensive though..we moved on couldn't get to see hornbills n some empty enclosures. Along the way eagles n vultures followed by emus n some tall birds enclosures. We missed the bird shows.. There's free children wet play area along the way. Pelicans n flamingoes free area for nice photographs. Hawk shows available late afternoon."
,,Bird Paradise,5.0,,"We went to Jurong Bird Park during Chinese New Year. We arrived at around 8:30 am when the park was opening by taxi. Before it got crowded, we managed to look around the penguins and flamingos. Then we looked the shows such as ""Birds of prey"" and ""High flyers"" by noon.
After we had luch in the park, we looked around all the places including feeding the budgies at the park. We enjoyed ourselves looking at lots of colourful birds and recommend everyone to go there."

,,misleading images,3.0,,I was disappointed that the pictures show bird feeding with large birds. but the ones we were allowed to feed were only the smaller parrots. so while i enjoyed the experience i was still disappointed.
,,So much to look at!,5.0,,"I have been wanting to visit Jurong Bird Park for a long time & it did not disappoint when I finally made it there last week!
If you love birds, this place is a must because it is amazing!
So many species to see, especially in the waterfall aviary!
There are birds of many colours & sizes everywhere and sometimes you don’t really know where to look!
The breeding centre was very cool! Got to see a couple of chicks in the incubators & watch the keepers looking after them!
I very much enjoyed my time there!"
,,Best attraction for nature loving persons,5.0,,"Best attraction for nature loving persons. You are amidst various types of birds, greenery and water. Birds are staying freely in this area and they are not scared of visiting public!

Tickets for this attraction were part of 4 packages we bought at Singapore Zoo though this place is situated at a different location. I went there with wife and adult children. Had a wonderful and memorable time. There’s a bird show also (held twice a day for about half hour duration) wherein the trained birds perform various tasks and they can even talk to the trainer. There are trams to take you to various places so that you don’t waste time to visit various locations. Guidance/information boards are plenty and they don’t confuse you!

Attraction has been very well conceived, executed and maintained. There's a waterfall aviary too. On overall it’s just too good an attraction. It’s a must visit attraction in Singapore."
,,Beautiful place to see hundreds of varieties of birds from across the globe in one place !!!,5.0,,"Jurong bird park is a nice place to see hundreds of variety of birds from all over the world in one place. Quite a few of these birds are on the verge of extinction or are very rare to sight in natural habitats. This aviary is planned to be moved to an alternate location near the zoo on Mandai Lake Road.

Jurong Bird Park has several bird species including a large flock of flamingos. It is currently the world's largest bird park in terms of the number of birds and second largest both in the number of bird species and land area. The biggest on this criteria exists in Germany.

The aviary has several areas which can be visited like Waterfall Aviary, Dinosaur Descendants, Lory Loft, Wings of Asia, World of Darkness, Parrot Paradise, Penguin Coast, Flamingo Pool & Flamingo Lake, etc. We also liked the Breeding and Research Centre which shows how the rescued birds are cared for and some of the important research work going on here.

There are a few Bird shows which one must go for - High Flyers show, Kings of the Skies show and Lunch with Parrots. All the shows ensure good participation from the tourists visiting the park.

There is a nice tram which we used to travel all across the aviary. This is really useful in saving time and is less tiring. Please ensure while buying the tickets you include cost of tram in the same. I"
,,Fasciating plae to enjoy close connection with nature,4.0,,This is a great half day of experience to enjoy the myriad of wild birds and colour enjoyed with this special place. Great value
,,Tired,4.0,,"When we visited the zoo night safari we learnt that the bird park is to be shifted to the same site as the zoo. This could explain the fact that we felt there was information lacking at the bird park. That said the bird park is still wort the time. getting there is no more difficult that the zoo though the bus connection at the train stop is not quite so obvious. The entry way with its arch of orchids is truly impressive. The lay out is not quite as efficient as the night safari at the zoo and we found we did some doubling back at times. We saw some spectacular birds and the bird show we saw was quite excellent. What disappointed us was that, at times, there was no information about the origin of these birds. Generally the huge walk in aviaries had notice boards that helped identify the birds within and we found ourselves trotting back and forth to do just that. But, at times we had no idea which countries were the natural habitat of these great.creatures. In one aviary we met an attendant willing to talk and we had a very informative conversation about the birds close by. We are anticipating that, when this bird park is to be relocated and when it is, the new venue will address the issue we encountered."
,,Pram parking,3.0,,Security staff is very poor in managing pram with babies inside. Insisted to park the pram when baby is still asleep when watching the bird show at the eagle vulture side.
,,Bird watching up close and personal,5.0,,"We were amazed at how beautifully organised this park is, the variety of birds it has - lots of which we had never seen before or knew existed - and the perfect amount of information it provides to make it interesting to learn. All set in a natural forest. We particularly loved the open areas like the waterfall aviary where birds do not seem caged, the flamingoes and the shows. The highlights for us were the parrot paradise and the keepers talks.Definitely worth visiting whilst at Singapore. If you go with young kids, do not miss the Birds of Play area bring their swimwear as there is a water playground for them to enjoy. The park is quite big, but you can get the tram ride if you do not prefer to walk too much."
,,Bird Paradise,5.0,,Truly lovely to see a beautiful collection of birds with such stunning colours. The male peacock in particular with its full set of feathers a special delight. Go see !
,,Bird Eye Tour,4.0,,"We always visit the Jurong Bird Park at least 4-5 times a year as our Son, Denver is a bird fanatic. This year we are very happy that they have a Bird Eye Tour where we get to see special behind the scenes. Upon our arrival, it was raining and Grace , our tour guide was very nice to reschedule us a new date but the weather suddenly clears up and the dark skies went away and we are so happy that Grace said we could still carry on with the tour. Grace is very welcoming and heart warming and Denver got really comfortable with her quickly and they both chatted away taking about the different kinds of birds and Grace was so patient with Denver’s queries, answering each of them with love. It was a memorable experience and we got to get up close with some of Denver’s favourite birds like the Hornbill, Hawk, Vulture and Owl. We even got to see a baby owl that was one month old at the time of our visit and it was so cute and fluffy. We loved and enjoyed the interactions and feeding sessions with Sally the Hornbill and the Hawks. Birds are actually very intelligent and very interactive and it’s actually really fun and exciting for young children. Even my one and a half year old Daughter enjoyed her bird Eye Tour experience. Highly recommended and If you happen to have Grace as your tour guide, it’s your lucky day cos she’s such a sweetheart and she’s really good with children."
,,Birds,5.0,,I am not a huge fan of birds so was a little nervous about the bird park but the birdlife here is amazing- a must see

,,Getting old,3.0,,The birds welcome you with a lot of noise. You are in their world. The place needs a good refurbishing. The trams are old. The bird show though one of its kind is old. The birds dont always follow instructions. The waterfall station is good....More
,,Needs a serious update,3.0,,"We visited Jurong Bird Park in 1988 for the first time and returned a couple of years later. We enjoyed it a lot. Therefore and because many years have gone by since then, we decided to visit again. Getting there by public transportation is not...More"
,,Beautiful shows,5.0,,"A lovely place to watch various types of hornbill , macaw , parrot. They have good collection of penguins."
,,Realistic Forest Experience,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is mostly made up of large glasshouse-like habitats. In some, you can walk through the habitats and see the birds in the various enclosures. Some have a large number of the birds roaming free within the glasshouse so they can fly past...More"
,,An amazing experience!,5.0,,Great place to visit with your children or solo. A place one shouldn't miss while visiting Singapore.
,,Jurong Bird Park - Singapore,5.0,,"there are birds which are endangered species. different kind of birds. we also saw a bird show, this is really surprising to see how birds are trained and do as perfectly as per instructions. birds are fed a particular time and even tourists are given...More"
,,A great day out for bird lovers,5.0,,"Highly recommended. Well organised park with elevated viewing areas to make it easier to see birds high up in the enclosures. Average time spent is 3-4 hours, but we happily stayed 4-5 hours including a refreshment stop."
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park - a must for all nature and bird lovers. There are specimens of magnificent bird life from around the world for viewing. 1 of the many attractions is the Waterfall Aviary, which focuses mostly on birds from Africa, has bird enclosures that extend to a towering height of 35 metres. All the other attractions including the
bird show which has the world's largest number of performing birds in a single act should not be missed. A great place to visit for locals & tourists, young & old."
,,Fly fly birds,5.0,,Fantastic refreshing manmade waterfall with aviary of birds & butterflies 🦋 🦅. A must visit in Singapore. Come & experience yourself. I like it ⭐️💝👏
,,"Birds, Birds and More Birds",5.0,,"As a nature photographer this has been a regular haunt of mine over the years. Here birds are on view from many parts of the world and some are in amazing large aviaries. If you dont want to hunt them down in the jungle or whatever their natural habitat may be, then this is a great place to spend the day. Get a pass that includes the Zoo and the Night Safari."
,,Variety of birds.,5.0,,It was wonderful to visit this park. Not did we see various birds but there was also an open air bird show. I was amazed at how birds too follow instructions. It's Educational for kids as well.
,,Beautiful Jurong,5.0,,First visit to Jurong but regular visitor to Singapore. This is a great outing for all different types of tourists and family friendly. It is a great stroll with a huge variety of birds to view in a variety of natural habitats. The diversity of birds was most impressive including a large number of endangered species. The information provided on each species was most useful. We were there on a particularly hot day so really appreciated being able to hop on and off the train as we went to different parts of the park. The artificial waterfall was a great photo opportunity. The individual shows were both informative and entertaining. I would thoroughly recommend this park if you have a couple of spare hours. It is accessible by public transport if you are prepared to train and bus.
,,"Great visit, as always :)",5.0,,"As always, it was a delight to visit this amazing bird park !! :-) we'll definitely come back! All the more reasons since I became a proud member :-))"
,,Good family outing,4.0,,"Birds show, feeding time and close contact with the birds. There's children dry and wet playground where both my kids enjoyed."
,,One of the must see places if you love animals,5.0,,Beautiful and exotic birds all in a lush tropical setting. I particularly liked the bird enclosure which gives you a close encounter with the birds as they road within freely.
,,Good experience,4.0,,Surprisingly fun. My child was introduced to a number of species of birds. The feeding of penguins was also surprisingly affordable and fun!
,,Hot! no sprinkle of water along the route. not cold enough at the show area..,2.0,,"Extremely hot! not fantastic at all. very very hot! no water sprinkle, or big fan along route n at show area. photoshooting services is lousy, only give small size soft copy🙄 i will not return with my kids, not recommended to friend"
,,Cute little park for a half day,4.0,,"My six year old son and I enjoyed this park. It's not going to knock your socks off like the Singapore Zoo, but it's cute, big enough to mean some real walking or a tram ride, and the birds seem well-cared for. The penguins are a fun thing to see."
,,Great day out,5.0,,"Really impressed with this park, despite its age it doesn’t show it at all. Everything is very clean and well maintained, loads of birds everywhere for kids to ogle over. The show is also really fun!"
,,colourful,5.0,,beautiful visit of this park with colorful and interesting birds. There are aviaries in which one can enter and see the birds more closely. It takes 4-5 hours to go around.
,,Jurong Bird Park Encounter,5.0,,We loved doing the hands on encounter at Jurong. Getting up close to the amazing raptors and Sally the hornbill who won over our hearts was a great experience. The park is filled with friendly staff and wonderful birds. Cant wait to see the new park in 2020
,,Amazing and well organized,5.0,,Everything in this park is beautiful and there is a wide variety of birds. It is quite big so you need to spend around 4 hours at least to see all birds.
,,A bird park like no other,5.0,,"A treat to the senses, Jurong Bird Park was a unique experience among delightful tropical flora and fauna. Apart from a wide variety of birds, there were green snakes, iguanas and colourful garden lizards that surprised us. The bird hatchery and nursery were interesting and educative to the entire family. I wish there were qr codes around the plants and creatures to take back their details or to seek more info about them.I had a plantsnap app which my 6 year old nephew took around to identify the large number of plants from the ginger family that were growing in the park. The shows were just right. The distance was just right to walk without skipping any of the exhibits. This one is truly a uniquely Singaporean attraction. Kudos to those who have kept it fresh and engaging!"
,,Beautiful Birds,5.0,,"Visited Jurong Bird park recently in December 2018. I must say that it was a wonderful day, all thanks to the courteous and supportive staff, ever ready to facilitate the visitors by all means! The High Flyers show at the pools amphi theatre won my heart, as to how they have trained their animals and birds about the concept of Reuse, Recycle and Reduce, and also educate the audience about it in a healthy way. HATS OFF TO BPR team and Management."
,,Family outing,4.0,,Great visit and family do had a enjoyable times there. Love the penguins & amazed by such slim legs of the flamingo 😅
,,Great Place,5.0,,"Jurong bird park is one of its kind bird reserve. Well maintained, nicely spread out and some really interesting activities with the birds."
,,Better than expected,5.0,,"Got to the park by 9.30 before it got busy
Lovely shaded walk. Beautiful planting. Saw a large iguana on the path.
Well mapped out.
Wonderful up close birds.
The waterfall enclosure had loads of different species - particularly liked watching the weaver birds make their nest.
Amazing blue macaws.
Wonderful parrot enclosure where the birds fed from your hand.
Good water park for the kids.
The penguins looked rather depressed!
Would definitely return."
,,Disappointed,2.0,,"It s my 4th time and I was disappointed ...

I really like this park and I was happy to come back ...
Compare to the other times many birds were missing ...
and my favourite part, the parrot area, is closed for a month !
Why not advising guests at the entrance ?
I would have been away ...
That s not fair ...."
,,Educational and interesting experience!,5.0,,"Jurong bird park is one of the four wildlife reserves in Singapore, which is located away from the other three, lying on the West part. It takes time to travel to the park but there are clear instructions on its website.
We love the way how the park keeps the birds that they give them as much space as possible to move around and the birds look great. The park also has different points that tells people about the history of bird and how they nurse them before joining them with other birds to face the public. It could be quite relaxing to walk around and we finally spent 3 hours in the park. To save some money, you could purchase park hoppers to make a bundle with other wildlife reserves. It worths."
,,Obsolete structure,2.0,,"Straight from the seventies, here is a structure far away from downtown where many birds are invisible lost in the trees and others are like chicken in the yard. Some areas (like penguins) are simply very sad.
Have theater lenses for watching and magnification if you want to take meaningful pictures."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,One of the unique experiences in Jurong Bird park is the visit to the incubation center. You can see eggs hatching and hatchlings being fed by experts. Its a unique experience. Birds in the waterfall aviary are free to roam around and they are very visitor friendly. its a nice peaceful place and fun to visit. typical time to visit is 3-4 hours.
,,Wonderful placeto visit,5.0,,"Spent a delightful few hours exploring this site. Birds are well cared for and site is extremely well maintained and clean.Great variety of birds to see and easy to walk around and view the different areas. Sudden Singapore downpour didn’t even spoil our visit. Well worth a look at. Will be moving to new site new Singapore Zoo sometime soon, so will definitely have to return for a look at this new site."
,,An Excellent Place to see Birds.,5.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is moving closer to the Zoo in two years. It's a shame because this is a magnificent attraction for bird lovers (and even non Bird lovers), with walk-through aviaries, well attended gardens, plenty of birdlife, unusual toucans, an amazing collection of macaws, including the very rare Sphix's macaw and of course the hard to find Hornbills (which because of their aggressive nature are not ""walk through."" In fact this is much better than the zoo. Highly recommend. Plus they have Penguins."
,,Birds Of A Feather,5.0,,"Amazing place. So many different species of birds you can see up close. Birds of prey, parrots, Hornbills, Bird of Paradise and so many more. You need to allow at least 4 hours to really appreciate this place. A must visit when in Singapore."
,,Not a pleasant experience,1.0,,"My visit to Jurong Bird Park was not a pleasant one. I was hoping it would be more like a bird santcuary than a zoo, and thus my expectations may have been a bit off, but it was very zoo like with enclosures that were not clean, were overcrowded, and smelly, especially the penguin exhibit which was full of algae. I left after only 30 minutes after realizing the park would not get any better. I would not visit again and would not recommend for others to visit either."
,,Must visit,4.0,,"Good to see various birds in one place - including penguins, birds of prey, flamingos and toucans. There are interesting shows day long. The path is quite steep and it is better to opt for the tram ride to get around."
,,Further out from city centre but worth the trip out to visit,5.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is not the easiest attraction to get to, being around 20 kilometres from the city centre. To get there I took the MRT on the green East-West line and got off at Boon Lay MRT station. The public bus number 194 goes from Boon Lay MRT to the front gate of the Jurong Bird Park in about 7 minutes. You can do the same on the return trip but have to walk across the road in the pedestrian tunnel to catch the 194 bus on the other side of the road to return to Boon Lay MRT station.

Being so far out of town the park wasn't crowded compared to other Singaporean attractions and I bought my entry ticket at the gate without queuing. You have the option to pay $5 for unlimited use of the tram inside the bird park, I definitely recommend this even for a keen walker, as the tram does loops of the park which makes it easy to move around and see which sites worth visiting.

This bird park have some unique birds I haven't anywhere else and the park have plenty of lush green gardens with flowering plants and scenic lakes. The main highlight is the 11am show at the Pools Amphitheatre, but the penguin feeding and the 30 metre tall waterfall were also very impressive.

You can buy food and drink from several outlets inside the park which even has a Pizza Hut, and well maintained restrooms are scattered throughout. My visit to this bird park took me 6 hours from the time I left the hotel until my return, so if planning to visit the park you should budget at least half a day for a proper visit."
,,"Good in parts, poor in others",3.0,,"It was pretty busy, packed with lots of tourists so the queues for the trolley ride were extensive and after 15 mins waiting I decided to go off on foot. It is quite a long way to wall to see all of the exhibits. I don't know what I expected, but most of the birds were in cages which is a disappointment and somewhat sad to see such beautiful creatures locked away like that. Some of the Parrots at Parrot Paradise looked as if they were stressed, showing repetitive behavior that caged animals so often do after prolonged captivity. I actually found it upsetting. The Waterfall Aviary was however good, with free flying birds in a big enclosure and the birdsong was a wonderful experience (not that you could actually see the singing birds all of the time). In all it is a place that can thrill and disappoint at the same time. If you want to see free birds in Singapore, go to Changi Village and Park - its free and I have seen Sea Eagles swoop down and take fish, Herons, Hornbills, Parrots and many more species just by sitting at the water front."
,,Relaxing day out,4.0,,"We got the direct bus from Suntec City out to Jurong which was very convenient, however, if there's four of you I reckon it'd be cheaper to get a taxi.

Jurong is a quiet day out, no hoards of people and you're able to walk around the park and enjoy the birds.

It is due to relocate next to the zoo in 2 years time, so I think it'll get very busy then so take advantage of it now!"
,,Lower than expected hype,3.0,,"I visited Bird park with my two kids in December 2018. I found it more of hype, my kids and I didn't enjoyed it very much and found not worth for the money paid. Train/tram stops at 4 stations only and hence it's totally waste of money. One need to walk a lot despite taking tram ticket. All birad show which showcases performance of parrots, maccao etc was very good. However Vulture show was not upto expectation. Only attractions where kids enjoyed were Penguin feeding and Pelican feeding. They should have kept more shows or interaction with birds to make it worthwhile. Ideally one should do Singapore Zoo and skip Bird Park."
,,"Birds,birds, Birds",5.0,,"If you’re staying in Singapore you must visit the Jurong bird park, the bird show is fantastic and will keep you spellbound, take your time to walk around as there is a surprise around every corner, of course in the wet season take your poncho or brolly because it will bucket down...marvel at the penguin display and take in the beautiful waterfall while having your lunch...."
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,It was a fabulous trip. We walked the park and enjoyed all the displays. Well marked. Park was very clean and staff were eager to assist. Refreshments were delish. We enjoyed the trip to the park tremendously🤗🤗🤗🤗
,,Waterfall Aviary was fascinating,5.0,,"Visited the park with my 6-year-old grandson who had a splashing good time at the water park The bird show was entertaining though the parrot did not quite sing as expected. The birds in both the walk-in aviaries were completely unafraid of visitors. The lorikeets were boisterous, the crowned blue pigeon and the aptly named ""superb starling"" were enchanting."
,,Aunt and nephew trip,4.0,,"It was fun. There are many species of bird. However, its tiring walking as the place is big. There are not many eateries inside bird park especially for halal choices (only has pizza hut)."
,,Very Satisfied Visitor,5.0,,"My wife, granddaughter and I had a very enjoyable time at the bird park. The waterfall and the bird show was entertaining and wonderful. Will definitely let all my friends know about the fantastic bird park experience."
,,Well organised Bird park and their live show,4.0,,The best part about Bird is their live show. One should not miss that and their timing is available in their website and ticket counter. Try to reach here by 9am so that you can cover all the shows and park w8th ease
,,Jurong Bird park a must do attraction in Singapore,5.0,,As usual the park was very well maintained and facilities were spotless - The location is fantastic and the variety of birds awesome - an absolute must see in Singapore even for a short stay.
,,"A little bit long in the tooth, with good reason",3.0,,"I first visited Jurong Bird Park in 1988, 30 years ago, and I was blown away by its beauty and variety. Now it looked kind of run down with too many old fashioned exhibits of birds in heavy wire cages. I learned that this is probably the last year it will be open in its present location as a NEW Jurong Bird Park is being built in the same area as the Singapore Zoo I have a feeling that the new one will be the best bird park in the World when it's finished. It really makes me want to come back to Singapore."
,,Birds bird's & more bird's,3.0,,"You are welcomed by the loud screeching of parrots. The tram ride round the park sets the tone. Disciplined.
The various stops each with its unique feature & bird's is nice. Waterfall station was good.
The flamingos, vultures, owls are amazing.

The show at Amphitheatre is unique.

The souvenir shop is a loot though.

Quite relaxing. Morning well spent.

The place needs to spruce up."
,,Worls best collection of birds,5.0,,"First bird park I have ever been, enchanting collection of bird with large areas for birds to roam around. Beautiful setting of natural like water falls. The park staff are very friendly."
,,Flamingos.....,4.0,,"We visited the park to fulfil a dream of me seeing Flamingos in real life. I was not disappointed the three displays were great. The park is hilly, so be prepared for the exercise. The park could so with more food options."
,,Nice Bird Park,4.0,,Been couple times to Jurong Bird Park. I love their Flamingos :* The park is easily to reach by SMRT and really entertaining with their collection of birds and shows.
,,Worth to visit,4.0,,"To look around, 2 hours is not enough, 3-4 hours will be good.Check the show time, before visit.Good for families."
,,Great shows,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park has great live shows & overall experience was unforgettable. Multi colored birds, parrots, macaws everywhere."
,,So nice to see,4.0,,"Lovely natural setting and he birds appear well taken care of. Love the colourful birds. We are delighted that you had a great time with the birds, especially the rare blue macaws!"
,,I love Shoebill,4.0,,There is a new family member in the Park: Shoebill. Another signature animal in Kemono Friends.I am visiting for Shoebill as well as penguins.
,,Parrot section depress birds staff act like prison guards,2.0,,"This is just a general observation during my visit to the bird park.
The caged parrots in the parrots section looked very sad. A few of them stuck to the cage sides. Couple of birds tried to reach the visitors as if trying to get out either that or feeling bored.
Being caged is not natural and parrots are highly fun-loving social creathres.And they need much fly time out in the sky freely.
While the female staff minded how the parrot tried to interact with the visitor. Please don't forget to care for the well being of the birds that are caged first, protecting them from physical interaction from visitors second.
If you want visitors to stay away from the birds. Please place them in the waterfall section don't caged them to see. Place them in waterfall section to roam freely that is the second best option.
In that way they have a choice not to interact with visitors. Remember staff are not a bird prison guard.Get your priority right from the start."
,,Very special place,5.0,,A lot of different animals to see I thought will be dirty and smell but I find out it so clean and tidy place.u can see the bird fly here and there.they also had show of the bird but please check the timing before u walk around
,,Solo trip,5.0,,Haven't been there since i was a boy. Pretty wonderful place to visit on a weekend alone. Well maintained and clean park. Definitely must watch the bird show.
,,Good Day out,4.0,,Great park - lots of large enclosures which is nice and would like to see more of thoseBus ride was good as it was hot and for $5 - why wouldn't you!
,,Not enough time allowed,4.0,,"Went here as part of a tour, weather was hot and humid and I have steel in both knees and my back. We spent about 2.5 hrs here, could easily have spent another 2 hours or so. The place has a few steepish hills that I found a little difficult but there were plenty of seats available to give the knees a rest, also there is a ""train"" system operating around the park. I would suggest a full circuit on this to get your bearings to what you want to see, timings and distances for the shows that are on offer. The waterfall enclosure was spectacular although you really have to search for the birds here. In the other enclosures most of the birds were accustomed to people so were not that skittish, therefore great photos. The big disappointment was the 1"" square heavy wire mess frontage to some of the cages - some cages had large plexiglass panels which permitted better photography. I watched the ""parrot"" show which was very good and permitted you to get up close for the good photos, unfortunately I missed the raptor show.
Please note that this sanctuary is being relocated in the near future to the same area as the zoo, I was assured the new location has much better housing for the birds and better photographic opportunities."
,,Jurong Bird Park,3.0,,This was an ok experience with nothing extra ordinary.... One must visit to check mark on the bucket list else can be skipped as well. The train is a saving grace to ply you up and down. For people who love to watch at birds and enjoy walking trails can visit this place
,,I couldn't imagine that it is so much fun,5.0,,"There is a big water game place for children, a great show and a lot of different bird species. I definitely recommend this park to visit."
,,Great morning out,4.0,,Took my son here and we had a lovely morning out. Unfortunately the rain did mean we decided to leave but we did get around the park and experience all areas.
,,5 stars Attraction - One of the Best in the World,5.0,,"Jurong birdpark has come a long way. I remember vividly visiting the birdpark as a small child, amazed by the number of species of birds there. My wife (then girlfriend) and I visited the birdpark back in 2012 and we had a very memorable visit. Now, I have became a father, we brought our son there to experience the wonderful park. He enjoyed every moment of it to the fullest!"
,,Wonderful time with my Son,4.0,,It is a lovely & tranquil bird park with a lot of activities and show for visitors. Clean environment and friendly stuff. Will definitely visit again.
,,Fun Place,5.0,,"Is a good place to go with children or family to have a learning journey. Some parts visitors may stay with birds inside the cage, is a different experience visitor may want to try it. Besides, there's few shows to let visitors watch the birds closely."
,,hub for animal lovers,4.0,,would be great to shift birdpark to mandai. i find jurong quite far. make mandai a hub so that we have better options when buying admission packages.
,,Superb very well designed,5.0,,A must visit for any trip to Singapore . Not to miss are the two shows they do at 11 am and 3 pm where the fantastic birds have been trained to entertain the audience. Kids would just love it as much as adults would be over awed. A nice toy train takes you around the park with stops if you don’t feel like walking the entire the Area. An Aviary has a large collection of birds from all over the world with well written write ups. .
,,A best place to enjoy with a kid,5.0,,"I went to the park with my 7yrs old kid. He thoroughly enjoyed the tour. Do not miss the High flying show there. A beautifully organized show of the birds. You can take photos with the flamingos if you want after the show.
In the park there is a artificial water falls and flamingo pool."
,,Great Bird experience,5.0,,"We have just returned from an amazing ""behind the scnes"" tour in Juring Bird Park. They call the tour ""Birds Eye Tour"". We had a wonderful and amazing nearly 2 hours tour with a number of very freindly/experienched and knowlegdeable staff. It was really great and can only recommend this special tour for other bird lovers. We got a lot of great pictures and indsides with us home. We even got a feather from the Owl as a souvenir. Great. The Bird parc is also really a great experince in it self and really value for money. We used 6 hours in teh park and saw both their bird shows."
,,Beautiful bird park - perfect family outing,4.0,,"Jurong bird park is an ideal half day trip, preferably made with family or friends. It has a huge collection of birds, beautifully housed in various landscapes.
Firstly, buy the tickets beforehand in order to avoid waiting in the queue.
Carry an umbrella/ poncho, a bottle of water (which you can refill in the park) and a camera.
If you prefer walking and spending time seeing birds, you can give up the tram ride though the tram gives you the option of spending how much ever time you wish between the pick up points.
We walked from stations 1 to 3 at leisure and got to see and interact with many birds. The African waterfall is beautifully landscaped and even smells like a deep tropical forest.
The parrot show is awesome and so is the lunch served with it, along with a lovely view of the flamingos. We didn't get to see the other shows though.
One of the best bird parks I have been to."
,,Huge value for single or family,5.0,,The park is very diverse. It offers family fun or just a place to see you favourite bird alone. You may take a bus train tour and pick a place of interest to spend more time. Excellent are the huge cages where you are facing birds flying around you. There is a variety of bird shows which are entertaining old and young. Remember to bring a lot of water with you. Catering is basic but tasty.
,,Nice,4.0,,I came here briefly. Its was not so expensive and I found my visit to be educational and entertaining
,,excellent! though a little far away!,5.0,,jurong bird park is away from the other 3 places (zoo etc). you need to take uber or normal cab to reach this place. the feeding time shows are very nice. the tram pass within the park is worth it else you will have to walk a lot! dont miss any stations!
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,"Our visit was filled with awe and awesome. Each display is large enough to let the birds move about in unrestricted fashion, which made me less guilty for seeing them in captivity. The one big loop layout makes walking along effective and non-repetitive. The extra money for including the shuttle pass is totally worth it. The displays are large enough with several birds that make it easy to spot them while in the shuttle.Kid and husband enjoyed feeding the birds a lot. Unfortunately by the time I got my turn the birds had been given a snack of grapes and thus non were around. Witnessing the interaction with birds during this feeding left me speechless. The birds communicated with movements and it was clear what they were trying to convey. This is an experience that shall forever stay with me.The park has a very interesting water play area, where the kid spend well over 3 hours and had to be coerced out at closing.While he was enjoying the cold splash I got to chat with Maggie on staff, who was studying lightening data for the park system. We had an insightful conversation about Singapore food culture, other playground, diversity, education system and what not. A big shout out to her for helping me understand Singapore a lot more.We had an amazing day and wish there was more time to go once again during the week long vacation.The cafes have great food options and the gift shop has some real neat stuff for sale.The restroom designs are very clever and they are maintained extremely efficiently. I would recommend an entire day here at least."
,,Awesome experience,4.0,,Went there with my 22 months old son & we had an awesome time. From shows to walks to tram ride it was all great. My son loved the areas where he could actually see and experience birds in nature (not in the cage). He ran after the peacocks and pigeons :)
,,A big mistake!,1.0,,"When buying a pass for all 4 parks no one mentions that the Bird Park is located so far away, that even if you finish with the Zoo and River park (which is easy) by 2-3 p.m. and wait until 7-8 pm to start the Night Safari, the park staff reccomends getting there the other day as you wont be able to get there and return in time (due to long distance and traffic). Such a shame!!"
,,Good but not amazing,4.0,,I did enjoy this park and there was some lovely birds but there's just something not right about seeing them caged up! At the back of the park is a big cage that you can walk inside which was really awesome! I'd read up on a few reviews for the bird park and zoo to see how long it would take and most was saying you can do both in one day! Well you really can't and we had to cut the bird park short by about half of it to get to the zoo in time. If you want to see everything properly I'd day you could easy spend the whole day at the bird park then do the zoo on a different day. If you do want to do both in one day it is doable but you need to get there for when it opens!
,,Great array of international birds!,4.0,,"The array of birds from around the world is amazing! Most of them are in a natural environment except maybe for the penguins. I especially enjoyed the birds of paradise, penguins, giant macaws, pelicans, toucans, and the bird shows. The better places to eat are outside the entrance. You can get a stamp on your hand to reaccess the park, so it's best to plan your route ahead of time."
,,Good place,5.0,,Good place to visit. Great display of the different birds in the world. Good show performance too! Recommended!
,,fascinating,4.0,,"The highlight to any visit to the Bird Park is the essentially ""circus"" show put on by the birds and trainers that demonstrates the intelligence level of at least some of the birds. The heart of the Park however are the features aside from the show. The wide range of species in their habitat are fascinating but because the birds are held in ample caged areas well supplied with vegetation it is at times difficult to locate the individuals that are housed in a given cage. However taking the time to spot them is rewarding. There is also a small railroad service that can be taken from major location to location that is especially handy for families with small children or the aged like myself."
,,Exotic Birds You Might Never Get to See Lest You Get to Travel the World,4.0,,"The bird park gives you access to the colourful birds of varying sizes from exotic places and those endemic in the Asian region. There are shows inside the park, which you should catch, so take note of their timings. We got to watch the ""High Flyers Show"" on the Pools Amphitheatre which is near the entrance. It showcases the colourful high flying macaws from Africa, which was awesome! Next show we got into was the Birds of Prey, which featured humongous vultures! When buying tickets, you get to purchase an add-on for the tram, which allows you breeze through different stations in the park instead of walking. Although walking would be great of your health, trekking the park might not be advisable in the sweltering heat of the Singapore tropical weather. We started late in the afternoon, so we only were able to visit about 60% of park. So it might be best to start early to be able to enjoy the whole park. I heard they're moving the park to a new location (nearer to the Singapore Zoo and to the Night Safari), so that might provide a different experience overall. We visited the park because our toddler loves birds, and living in the city-state that is Singapore, you don't really have the chance to seeing exotic birds apart from those endemic in the island country."
,,Worth the detour,5.0,,"The best bird experience ever. Usually birds are hard to see. With few exceptions we saw all the birds we wanted to see. The difficult ones were the hornbills. (See the review that mentions the Birds' eye tour, which does that.) It will be good in 2020 when the bird park is near the zoo. Until that take the trip: $20 taxi from the centre."
,,GREAT BIRD SACTUARY,5.0,,"The bird park was really good, it is educational and it is good to see that it is playing a part in the conservation of endangered species."
,,Grt experience must visit,5.0,,"I like the shows on offer , they are near to nature not altering the natural well being of birds with lot of information about the species. Very well designed bird park as if moving in natural trails"
,,Birds Birds Birds-,4.0,,A great visit to see birds at the Jurong Bird Park. Most of the bird exibits are fantastic while a few are hard to see as they are in metal cages and hard to see. Mostly the vultures etc.
,,An optional attraction if time allows,3.0,,Some good attractions like bird flying show and up close with colorful birds (parrots etc) inside the fenced cage where they fly free while we walk in. Most of birds are in the cages we see them they the glass window or fence which is not very attractive.
,,Lovely Birds,3.0,,We went on an afternoon trip and it was not really long enough we should have taken longer but it was interesting all the same . We did think it was amusing that they cancelled the penquin feeding because it was raining ha ha.
,,A must visit place,5.0,,"It was a wonderful experience visiting JBP with family and kid. A must visit place, the shows were amazing."
,,Fun place,4.0,,"Singapore is a small island, but I still felt like this was a little out of the way. It does have some lovely birds, a good playground, and plenty of opportunities to feed the wildlife. It is a nice place to spend and afternoon and seems like it would be great for kids."
,,Well Maintained Bird Park,4.0,,"We visited JBP with our 6 yrs old Kid. He although enjoyed but we had same sad feeling of seeing birds in cage rather than they enjoying their natural habitat. Having said that,Probably we visited JBP at right time as Older Kids may get bored seeing caged birds. Yes they are doing a good job in conservation of endangered species which is really appreciated.
Overall its well kept and well Maintained."
,,Fantastic Bird Park,4.0,,"On a recent visit to Singapore,we visited here as part of 4 Park ticked encompasses Juorng, River Safari, Night Zoo and Singapore Zoo. The site is a short MRT ride outside of central Singapore and it covers a large site. There is a vast array of avaries (including one with a massive waterfall). There is also plenty of cover in case the weather does turn.There is vast array of bird species that you only find in Asia. Well worth a visit as part of the 4 Park ticket, a good way to spend a few hours"
,,Enjoy the bird feeding,5.0,,My and my family enjoyed the Bird show as well as feeding to the birds. They come and sit on you hand. Feed them by your hand.
,,Loved the birds there - a must see for bird lovers!,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a must see for bird lovers in Singapore, in fact, a must see attraction for all. Pigeons, doves, parrots, flamingos, pelicans, hornbills - you are going to surely have a great time amidst nature.

I recommend buying tickets online, for there is a long queue at the ticketing counters at the park and thus, it costs time. Taxi is the best way to come to Jurong Bird Park, since the MRT-Bus Combo takes a very long time and is inconvenient, too.

Lory Loft, Waterfall Aviary, Wings of Asia, Royal Ramble, the show, Flamingo and Pelican Lakes, Hornbills, are some of the many sights worth visiting. Not to forget the beautiful Penguin Coast just at the entrance.

There are many dining options there, with Pizza Hut Express being inside the premises of Jurong Bird Park. I recommend buying the ticket for the unlimited Tram Ride too, if travelling with elderly or small children. Very convenient and not expensive.

Being a pigeon lover, I loved the aviary ""Wings of Asia"", where there was a large variety of friendly-pigeons.

Definitely recommend this memorable attraction!"
,,Lovely,5.0,,"It’s a lovely park. We enjoyed “lory loft” the most. The lorries are so friendly, they actually come and sit on your hand and you can even feed them (you have to buy their food from the counter). All the shows were worth watching too"
,,"Many birds, clean, 👍🏿 facilities,",5.0,,"Good ambience and enviroment, many interested venue to looking for.. 👍🏿👍🏿Entertaining enough... will take my family for next trip to singapore..."
,,Nice park,4.0,,"We really enjoy our visit despite of the really bad weather.. We need to visit again, a shiny day this time!"
,,Disappointing,3.0,,Great place for children to be introduced to exotic birds but disappointing to someone who prefers birds in their natural setting even if somewhat confined. Birds performed tricks and most were in cages. Some fairly large cages but still unable to fly. Needs serious updating to meet new standards for avaries where birds have a lot of freedom and people are confined! Great “collection” of birds but saw no evidence of protecting from extinction or special breeding programs. More of a zoo than a reserve/preserve.
,,No speaker/mc on the tram.....tram shld go 2 rounds or slower.........,3.0,,Shld have mc on e tram.prefer to be JBP staff who well verse bout the birds wen we pass-by while on e tram......
,,Place is good but for the staff,3.0,,This is my third visit to the park and my son's first. The place gives that wonderful experience of being with the birds while feeling that they are not constrained in a cage. The budding bird watcher in my son enjoyed the park.A bit of eye soar was the staff attitude. There was not enough warmth with the staff. Even though I had the park hopper plus ticket which entitled me for tram service. The staff front ending the tram service was more interested in chatting with her colleagues than to check my ticket. She bluntly refused that we are required to buy a separate ticket and continued chatting.
,,"Not Bad, Shows at the park are saving grace",3.0,,"I took a park hopper ticket and am thankful I opt for it because none of the park now is worth visiting with the kind of money that is being charged. Good for the first time visitors but same story as night Safari park, zoo and river safari, park has not upgraded since last 10 years and only saving grace were the shows actually repeated shows with same themes, if it rains you are screwed and shows gets cancelled (here cannot blame the park) but there is no alternative they have in place as all the employees volunteers disappear and tourist are left on their own and this same experience over the years, was at least happy to see birds. quality of restaurants were bad. If you have visited earlier please utilize your children's vacation, time and your money better."
,,"For Bird geeks, its awesome! But fun for all...",5.0,,"I went here about 6 years ago for the first time and loved it so much. It was a must see on this trip back to Singapore and wasnt disappointed. They have added quite a bit since I was here last time and really improved other attractions. Took us about 3 hours to tour the park. I was especially excited for the rare macaws that are on display ....the Spix;s for example are extinct in the wild and only 150 in captiviity, so it was a real treat to get to see them in person. I love feeding the lories and lorikeets in their massive aviary but it did seem like there were much fewer in number than last time I was here. Most people seemed to have a hard time getting enough birds to drink all the nectar they provide. Most everyone just set the little cups down because there arent enough birds interested in coming around to drink the nectar. Anyway, its worth the trip out to Jurong. TAkes about 45mins from downtown. We took the green line all the way to Boon Lay station from City Hall. Didn’t have to change lines that way. Then you transfer to the 194 bus for about 10 mins and it drops you off in front of the park. Cost us S$1.60 each for the bus, you need exact change and just pay on the bus. The bus depot at Boon Lay station is easy to navigate and find the bus. Definitely cant wait to go back!!"
,,Birds-A-Plenty,5.0,,"This park is very well laid out. If you intend to visit the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and River Safari, the 4-park ticket can save you a lot of money and this 4-park pass can be purchased at the first of any of the afore-mentioned parks. for an extra $S10 you can purchase train rides at these venues. As the weather was very humid, after walking through the parks, the ride to top off the day was very welcome."
,,Underrated attractions worth a visit but inaccessible,5.0,,"I wasn't attracted to the bird park due to the location and less marketing. It was my first time seeing a completed bird park and honestly speaking, I was amazed by the well-organized daily activities and a huge place to walk around. It's good to bring sufficient drinks, umbrella, and shades along with you."
,,Loved the experience!,5.0,,"There was a wide variety of birds, could feed the birds as well. Well organized. Couldn't catch a show but enjoyed the experience."
,,The most complete bird park,5.0,,I brought my familiar here. My son enjoyed the birds. We took photos with the birds too. The park is very clean and very organized.
,,A lots of birds!,4.0,,A lots of birds! Some of them is rare for me as it was my first time seeing them. It’s good to bring along mosquitoes repellent especially you’re wearing short pants or sleeveless top. The only downside is limited choice for food and limited restaurants.
,,An okay place to visit if you are around the area,4.0,,"Not too bad a place to visit although some areas have much more concentration of mosquitoes than others.

My kid loves it there, not sure why, but it could be better if they have more food & beverages amenities around the place to improve the experience.

Lack (have but only 1) of the big birds (e.g. eagles, hawks, vulture etc.) made it abit disappointing.

To move the owl section away from here is the worst decision for JBP imo. But knowing that you guys are looking at closing this place down ....nvm then."
,,The entertainment of bird shows is wonderful,5.0,,Loved the zoo and also the night zoo which is just across the road. Sentosa Island is also worth the trip especially the aquarium
,,I wish I could rate this 100 Star.,5.0,,"Best place in the world. Period.
I pre booked my ticket online and planned out my 5 days in Singapore from Australia, scheduling the bird park for the first day. 3 days later we ran around the aquarium as fast as we could just to make a second trip to Jurong again.

I am a zoo keeper and love visiting zoos in different countries. I had always heard great things about Jurong from fellow bird lovers, keepers and breeders. I was not dissatisfied at all!

We decided to do the Birds Eye Tour where we got to meet a beautiful hornbill names Sally (shout out to her keeper Maddy!). We also got to fly a bird of prey on the glove. Our tour guide Grace was amazing. Such a beautiful person who couldn’t love her job anymore and was just happy to show people around in hopes her enthusiasm for the birds would rub off.

After the tour, we met up with Peter the hornbill keeper who took a good hour out of his extremely busy day to educate us on his birds. I started off knowing absolutely nothing about hornbills, to them being one of my favorite birds. Thank you so much Peter for your hospitality! This guy needs a pay rise, such a legend.

I’d also like to mention Mark in the breeding centre. He introduced us to a baby spoonbill which we got to feed, and we joked about how much of a pain eclectus parrots are to handraise. He had a smile on his face the whole time.

In Australia, zoo keepers always seem to want to “one up” each other in their facilities and keep training tips to themselves because they don’t want another zoo to be ‘better’ than them, but Jurong was nothing like that. Grace mentioned that if any of my keeping friends wanted help knowing how to breed certain birds, Jurong would love to give them some tips. That’s what the bird world is all about. Helping each other out.

So not only was the staff AMAZING but the actual exhibits were next level. The lory loft was my personal favorite as I am obsessed with lorikeets and own and handraised a few of my own. The waterfall exhibit with the African greys also gets a special mention.

So thanks Jurong for being the best bird park around and now my all time favorite zoo."
,,The Feathered Ones at Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"It will move by 2020 to a new location as part of the Eco-tourism Hub in Mandai, joining the Singapore Zoological Gardens, River Safari and the Night Safari with a host of other new developments.

I don’t remember the first time I visited but the last outing in 2015 was memorable as the trip was made with some 30 elderly persons on a company-organized outing community involvement event. This time, I had the pleasure of strolling through the park to see what I might have missed in the last visit – afterall, that trip was a “working trip”.

The 2 bird shows remained the key highlights. The “Kings of the Skies” at the Hawk Arena was an awesome display of birds of prey – the hunting skills, the sharp eyes, the majestic flights. The “High Flyers” at the Amphitheater has always been a treat with the colors of the bird on display, the interaction with the audience, the intelligence of this feathered ones. The finale of birds at the end of the show was still a sight to behold, I remembered there were more birds and colours many years back.

Built on a bowl-shaped valley, Lory Loft (another highlight) offered a two-tiered feeding tower that reached right into the middle of the aviary with a 360-degree view of the area. But where were the lories and lorikeets hiding when I visited? Perhaps taking an afternoon nap after a morning of hard work? I remember the colourful experience the elderlies had in my last visit when many more of these beautiful winged creatures would feed off the hand-held cups of fascinated visitors young and old. How often you have birds perching on your arm or shoulder, feeding off your hand?

The waterfall aviary was another favourite. Towering at a height equivalent to 13 storeys, it houses one of the world's tallest man-made, indoor waterfalls. The crashing sounds of water, the panoramic view of the landscape from the suspended bridge, the close encounters with Guinea fowls along the trails, the myriad of birds fluttering and perching on the trees, and the sight of the some of the more reticent birds in action. This aviary is a walk-in paradise.

There were some more attractions – the Pelican Cove, The Flamingo Lake, The Flamingo Pool, another walk-through segmented aviary where you can catch a glimpse of the birds of paradise… and there is the newest attraction which is the Parrot Paradise near where the Swan Lake is. Well, I would have preferred a walk-in experience but the parrots were caged exhibits. Maybe they needed to prevent bird escapes.

For the young ones, there is a playground and small water park where they can have fun while the adults take a break from the walking. Another nice cool place to hide away would be the viewing gallery within the Penguin enclosure where visitors can enjoy the tranquillity in a cool darkened environment, resting your aching legs in full sight of a colony of aquatic flightless birds from the south-pole with occasional dive-in spectacles.

The Jurong Birdpark will be missed and I will be planning a couple more trips before the move to Mandai in a couple of years or so. At the same time, I am looking forward to a grand new home for The Feathered Ones."
,,"It's good, especially the trained birds show",3.0,,"The park is quiet outside the city so travel will take time. Tickets can be bought as a combo of zoo+river safari+night safari+bird park. The park is pretty, has variety of birds, clean and we'll maintained. There is a huge clan of penguins once you enter. There are two shows where birds are trained and is pretty amazing. There is a singing and talking parrot as well. Also, the park is situated on kind of a hill which makes it difficult to walk. So if you have elderly or kids along, be sure to take the tram. Other than the shows, the park is usual. If you are travelling by MRT, you will have to take bus 138 from the station which will take another 40-45 minutes."
,,Not just for kids,5.0,,"This jungle-like park is an awesome way to spend a few hours. There are many attractions and different bird species wherever you turn, and the performances are well done as well.
My recommendation - get there as early as possible before it gets too hot and crowded."
,,I had prebooked tickets online,5.0,,"Since I love birds, its possible to avoid the long queues and book online entry ticket. I was so enamoured by the exciting bird shows that I was able to witness. I spent 4 hours here as there were so many antics and species of birds to see."
,,Good aviaries,4.0,,"Around $16 each way in a taxi, There are some great walk through aviaries which are huge, one of them you can buy a small cup of bird food for $3 and as your walking round the Lori will come down & feed from you which was really nice. Some of the other enclosures were small but the park is moving (next year I think) to where the Zoo, River Safari & Night Safari are so hopefully they will build more of the huge walk in aviaries."
,,Kid Explorer's,4.0,,The show time arrangement was good as we able to watch almost all the show in time without rushing from area to area.
,,Amazing place with superb maintenance,5.0,,"What a beautiful place however, we decided to skip few birds as we aren't avid bird fans. However, whatever we saw (the shows) was mesmerizing and will stay with us forever.Photograph prices are too steep and I doubt even 1% of visitors buy it. Why not reduce it to sligllhtly normal levels and make more people buy it. You can still make very decent money. Think about it :)"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Been here with my family and it’s an incredible experience, not just the variety of birds but the shows they put up are extremely good. Recommend not to miss the shows as one could never get so close in life to these birds in an open environment. The park is Maintained very well and adequately staffed. Recommend to buy the 4 in 1 pass as it’s cost effective."
,,Exciting short adventure for people of all ages!,5.0,,Excellent location for a fun filled weekend/vacation morning. Only suggestion is to go in a bit early around 0830am. Tends to get really crowded esp during holiday season. Make sure you enjoy the various bird shows (Timings are generally aval online). Have fun!
,,Amazing!,5.0,,The Jurong bird park is a must visit when in Singapore. You can see birds that you would have little chance of seeing anywhere else. We paid for the birds eye tour and what an amazing experience that was worth more than what we paid I feel. On the day we visited no one else had booked the tour so we had our own private one hour experience. Getting to handle birds of prey was a once in a lifetime experience and Sally the Hornbill was just gorgeous. The staff and keepers go out of their way to ensure you have a fantastic experience
,,One of the most pleasant surprises in Singapore,5.0,,We took the 4-in-1 package from the Zoo and after 3 days we went to this Bird Park and it was probably one of the best decisions we took in Singapore. The Park is huge and it takes at least 4-5 hours to see at your own pace the amazing birds from above and below.
,,Highly recommend for family bonding time,5.0,,Best choice for family outing. Show is great and variety of birds to look. Children enjoy the tram ride and bird shows.It would be better if there is bird's feeding place so children can have some activity with birds.Oh yeah the photo taking session at the entrance is great but a bit pricey.
,,nice shows,5.0,,"Huge park full of different kinds of birds. They had fantastic shows as well … staff were lovely, really working hard on making guests enjoy themselves ...
We got the chance to feed some birds … and watch tricks and cool shows.
The best thing was the tram that allowed us to have a glimpse of the whole park at first before we start roaming on foot.
Such a lovely time … highly recommended for everyone of all ages.
Those intending to but 4 parks tickets, it is best to be visit Jurong park on a different day to enjoy as many shows without rushing."
,,ok for half day visit,4.0,,park is not big. bird shows are entertaining. feeding times gives the kids an opportunity to feed the birds eg penguin etc.. prepare a $2 note.. no change given.. limited numbers allowed to feed but perfectly understandable or will end up over feeding. good to have water dispensers around the park. bring your own water bottle to fill. jurong hill next to it worth a quick 5 min stop to see the view of jurong island
,,Large and Diverse range of bird species,4.0,,"A very goof display of a diverse range of bird species. Was definitely worth the visit. My only negative observation is that some of the aviaries holding the larger birds looked small and the birds within the cage looked ""bored"". But maybe i just prefer to see my wildlife a bit more free range."
,,Must see,5.0,,This is a great day out for all of the family. The park is very well set up and well cared for. They do a great job of giving the birds as much freedom as possible while still making it easy to see the birds. The bird shows are excellent and the staff do a great job. Definitely a ‘must see’ in Singapore.
,,Mildly interesting!,3.0,,Lots of birds and quite smelly. The penguin enclosure was depressing. The other sections were ok to visit but nothing great really. Expected a lot more than one bird in some cages.
,,Family visit - long way from Singapore city,4.0,,"Good time pass for 2 to 3 hours. Highlight was the aviary, parrot park and the shows were good. Visit it either in the morning or in the evening as the birds will be resting or tired in the hot times. It was slightly monotonous towards the end as same birds were repeated in different cages. The trams were a well thought out idea, especially for the elders and those with small children, but to discover the park thoroughly, it is best to go about it on foot. All in all, it's an entertaining attraction for those who love nature and are curious about birds."
,,Great times at the Bird park !!!,5.0,,Our family had a wonderful time exploring the bird park and feeding of birds. A great chance for childen and adults to bond and learn together!
,,Where colors live,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is one of my favorite places to spend a whole day whenever I visit the modern and vibrant Merlion City.
Jurong Bird Park is Asia’s largest, with a collection of over 5,000 birds from 400 species, including some endangered species like the birds of paradise, macaws, birds of prey, etc.
This bird park offers so much fun and education towards its visitors about the life of bird. There are some exhibits and two that I like most are the ""Penguin Coast"" and the ""World of Darkness"". In Penguin Coast you will see how several penguin species are put together in a coastal-area-like exhibit. They can swim and hop on rocky surfaces, while sometimes they will just lay down and cooling themselves lazily on the ice made by the ice machine. You must come to their feeding time to see them swimming to catch fish from their keepers.
The World of Darkness exhibit is home to several owl species. Since most owl species are nocturnal, the ambience is controlled in such a way that inside the owl exhibit, the day time is turned into night time. Thus, you will see the owls actively flying and preening their feathers, also hunting for food. However, the last time I visit the park, they already closed down the owl exhibit.
The highlight of the bird park in my opinion, is the bird show. You must not miss the two bird shows, the ""High Flyers"" and the ""King of the Skies"". The High Flyers show will let you see some bird species demonstrate their ability, like the talking parrots. While the King of the Skies show will let you mesmerized by the keen senses of birds of prey when they are hunting for food in the wild. You should also see the feeding frenzy of the pelican, the keepers will introduce you to the 9 pelican species in the bird park while feeding them their favorite fish. It is a trully nice experience to have since some of the pelicans will fly above your head with their massive wingspan, circling around the pond, yet they are not flying away.
Jurong Bird Park, in my opinion, is a must visit place when you go to Singapore. It is one good place for adult and children alike to learn a lot about the life of bird and the conservation efforts done by the Wildlife Reserve Singapore to save them from extinction.

p.s. I do not know if it is a temporary program or not, but if you fly Singapore Airlines or SilkAir, do not forget to bring your boarding pass with you to the park to get a 10% discount on your admission fee."
,,Good interaction with birds,5.0,,"Must watch for all who go to Singapore . The penguin are primary attraction, u can feed them on availability basis . The birds performances are amazing. Four shows are there 10:30,11:30,1:30,3:00.all r different shows. Don’t miss"
,,Clean and orderly park,4.0,,"It was pleasant experience to walk around the park.If you are bird lovers, you will enjoy this place much."
,,Nice park,5.0,,It is easy to get to the park. There are a lot of different kinds of species. I like the experience that we can get closer to birds and take photos of them. But I saw a rat in the aviary...
,,great place to visit,5.0,,"- The jurong bird park can be easily termed as the best Singapore attraction. So many birds with so much chirping was extraordinary. The 2nd tram stop of Lory Loft with parrot feeding was out of world. - There are two shows i.e.1000 hrs (king of sky/ eagle show) and 1045 hrs (high flyers show). The high flyer show was great and should not be missed. But as we reached late, we missed the 1000 hrs show. The same show is repeated at 1600 hrs. But we could not wait till then and left at 1430 hrs. So either you reach 0930 hrs or 1400 hrs. There are also bird feeding shows of penguins and pelican. Both were great and are must watch."
,,Jurong bird park,4.0,,Generally a pleasant place to visit 😊If can increase more species of bird will great!Tram ride is a must.. Staffs are friendly & polite.
,,Overall Experience,5.0,,Overall the place was very clean and lesser crowds compare to the zoo. Staffs was all very friendly!
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The bird park was beautiful, clean and organised. The rangers were so friendly and efficient. Thank you so much for the amazing experience!!"
,,Lovely outing for the kid,3.0,,Good shows/performance. Good range of birds in the park.Need to improve1. Penguin feeding didn't take place at 10:30am. Disappointed.2. Queue for tram at Station 1 too crowded.
,,flying without wings,5.0,,Jurong bird park always special - i would seen shows many times and still it is amazing and exciting. every bird you look at feel refreshed . wonderfully kept .thanks a lot for making my day
,,"Amazing surroundings, great shows, brilliant way to interact with birds at feeding timings & during shows",5.0,,"Feeding the penguins, parakeets, pelicans, flamingoes, etc was a great experience for my 7 year old nephew. Very well managed. The shows are very informative while at the same time fun and entertaining. Only One issue - THEY DO NOT ACCEPT CARDS FOR ANY FEEDING THE BIRDS ETC ACTIVITIES INSIDE THE PARK, you need to pay with cash."
,,"Large park, many nice and unusual birds easy to see",4.0,,"Very nice range of rare birds from penguins to hornbills, and activities to get close to them. Unfortunate that the tram ride is not included in the ticket (and the extra cost is not printed anywhere !) to hop in and out when tired ; fortunate that there are ventilated / A/C areas on the way to cool when too hot (café, exhibit halls...). The nursery is very interesting. Worth the trip to visit"
,,Birds all around,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is one of its kind. Located in the Western side of Singapore it is a bit away from the central district. We took a bus from the Jurong Point Mall here as there is no direct MRT connectivity. The park is huge in size and you have different sections for each kind of birds. We really enjoyed the bird show which was spectacular especially the Hornbills and the parrots part.

Do choose the Tram ride (especially on a sunny day) which gives you a quick ride around the park. You can choose to get down anywhere and hop back in. It was really a savior as the temperature was too high for a walk."
,,a wildlife treat,5.0,,The events and shows were well organised and the birds were a treat to watch.The wings of fire show is a must watch for all bird enthusiasts.
,,Average experience,3.0,,"Only good thing about this place is the show. This place is good for the bird and animal lovers. For rest of the people, they can keep it towards the end of their itinerary."
,,A different park indeed,5.0,,"Great place - shows are excellent.
Would suggest the park hopper tickets - if travelling with kids - unlimited tram rides are the best bet. Take a tram ride first and then visit the enclosures. Plan well in advance for the shows - arrive 15 - 20 min. before shows starts.
Worth a visit indeed."
,,memorable,4.0,,"The park is small but the planning and their presentation is superb. The tram ride has to be included in your ticket. The birds are in big enclosures . They are accustomed to visitors and seem to not mind them. They just walk by the side of you at the water fall enclosure. The highlights were the macaw and birds of prey shows. They were enjoyable and the presenters put up a very good show.
restaurants are available at the entrance. snacks available inside the park as well."
,,Birds in their natural habitat,3.0,,"The birds were inside large cage where even people can go in. One of them even had a waterfall inside. They seemed quite happy and unafraid of human.

An interesting for Bird lovers, but for normal people, might not be much.

Overall, I won't be going there again and will tell my friends to go only if they have nothing else to do. It's not a **must go** place."
,,Jurong Bird park review October 2018,4.0,,Brought my friends from china during early October. It was my second visit to JPB and the environment is good and eco friendly. suggestion to make it a better place would be adding more performance timing slots during weekends because when we visited we missed the only timing for the show and feel a bit disappointed.
,,AWESOME FOR THE FAMILY!,5.0,,Our first ever trip to the Jurong Bird Park as a family. The kids love it! The shows were great and the water-play area is a huge bonus :)
,,A definite pit-stop in Singapore for tourists,5.0,,Amazingly diverse collection of birds. Shows were fun too. Give yourself half a day to cover everything and get the tram ride (additional $5) to save you time.
,,Amazing park,5.0,,"Amazing park! Very well maintained, clean, offer some bird play shows ! We loved it a lot! Well organized as well. If you are tired to walk by foot, you can take tram."
,,Amazingly beautiful,5.0,,"If you like birds or wildlife in general, you’ll love this park. They have hundreds of species of birds, many endangered, In beautiful open habitats. The pelicans were my favorites. They have all the known species."
,,Loved it,5.0,,Was last here 11 years ago and loved how the Bird Park had improved. Family all loved seeing all the birds and had an awesome day. Very easy to get to by public transport
,,Great place to visit for kids,4.0,,This park has been built for a while and I seldom hear any guide tour would recommend this place. But I have a 5 years old daughter. She loves this place. You can see a lot of birds and it is a great place for kids.
,,Beautiful birds,4.0,,"The park is well managed and organized, clean and safe. The birds are beautful and relaxed. The different signs are clear and spots are easy to reach. Quite some choices for lunch and rest. If you go to the park by public transport, bear in mind that you still need to take a bus after mrt journey. Make sure you hv enough time on transportation."
,,Unique birds to see,4.0,,"I loved this park. Really well set out. Birds are beautiful and unique. If I was time poor, I would choose this park over the zoo."
,,Fantastic place to spend the day,5.0,,Really enjoyed our trip here. Staff were excellent and the birds at the shows were very impressive. It was great to see the birds all looking so healthy and well cared for by the park. The focus on conservation was also very good. A must visit for animal lovers.
,,Do you love Flamingos?,5.0,,"What a wonderful place! So many beautiful birds and wildlife. Even if you arent totally into birds, this place is beautifully fascinating! As for me...well I LOVE FLAMINGOS and this place had srveral varieties of Flamingos! So fabulous! And the staff are amazing, caring and so friendly. Very impressed."
,,Loved this place!!!,5.0,,We spent the whole day at the bird park!!! So amazing. The enclosures are all suited to the individual birdlife and sprinklers were going to cool the birds which was good to see. Lots of open enclosures for the birds to fly around. A lot of focus on conversation and preservation which was great to see. An amazing place and highly recommended. Lots of water refill stations everywhere which is great to see. Just amazing.
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Recommended not only for children, even adults! Do not miss and buy food for parrots and feed them - the beast."
,,Awesome find!,5.0,,"I loved this place. At one with nature and pretty birds, ugly birds, colorful birds, and plain birds. Lots and lots of walking so be prepared."
,,Disappointed,2.0,,"The park is a long way from the metro station, so would recommend taking a taxi there. As we talked for along time before we got to the park and I would buy tickets in advance.

The park in not very large and I was accepting different Birds but they seemed the same."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,bought ticket from website for the bird park. The bird park is out of way and does not have a direct way from MRT or Bus . So we ended up taking a taxi from Hotel to Bird Park which costs around $25. The bird park is pretty big and takes around 5 hrs to see it. There is a tram which you can ride and go to different sections and get off there and see the birds in that area. They have a lot of variety of birds and also different shows . Do not miss shows. For lunch there is a indian restaurant inside the park . Kids will enjoy it very much
,,A diverse array of exhibits,4.0,,"I love that this park is dedicated just to birds and it gives you a great insight into their wide diversity.
There is a wide variety of exhibits - from the informative and entertaining shows, to the hands on enclosures to the static displays.
My only criticism is that the design of some of the cages makes it very difficult to see the birds even if they are out in the open. But that said, it was a great day out and not so big that you cannot get around it easily."
,,Not worth the penny,2.0,,"There really isn't much variation of birds in Jurong Bird Park. The shows are just average. Other than the shows, there really is nothing but boredom."
,,A day with the Birds,4.0,,"Lovely location, arrived in time for the show, Beautiful Hornbills and Macaws. The Pelicans and Flamingos were amazing to see. Staff are very good with the birds. Not sure if Bald Eagles should be in captivity. It is a must visit for Bird Lovers"
,,amazing,5.0,,beautiful birds to look by and stupendous performances by the birds makes you wonder their abilities and agility.
,,Loved every minute,5.0,,"One of the best places for bird lovers in Singapore. I spend about 8hrs.
Timings are 9am- 5:30-6pm, weekdays are the best if you don't want the crowd. Check out the bird shows are go half an hr prior the show to get good seats. Worth waiting extra to watch it.
There are trams inside which take you to different stops and you can get off at any stop look around and get back onto another tram.
Food and beverages available inside the premises at decent rates.
Kids will enjoy this place and so will adults and senior members.
Loads of birds are seen, and you can feed parrots too, thoroughly enjoyed every minute.

,,Jurong bird park,5.0,,"Excellent day out. lots to see. The walk in enclosures were a highlight, as there was an opportunity to feed the parrots, which was great fun"
,,Indian vegetarian food at JB Park,4.0,,Curry Garden at JB Park served us fresh and delicious Indian food. Both veg and non veg options are available.
,,Loved spending my final hours in Singapore here :),5.0,,"Must love birds. I caught the 194 bus from Boon Lay (apparently the only bus to the park). The good thing is that the bus stop on the way home is the same stop (glad I asked the driver). It's a brief walk across the road to the park. Entry is reasonable, and more cost effective if you are considering going to some of the other attractions (had I known this, I might have spent my time a little differently). The park is around 2km in distance, and is designed so you walk a circuit to see all the areas. There is a train which is hop on/off for $5, however I preferred the exercise. You need to be able bodied to have the best experience. For example, the toucans were best viewed from the second level, and the lory loft feels like a ropes course. The highlight of my day was the show in the amphitheatre, up close with the macaws, flamingos (why do they not fly away?!), toucans etc. It was a fabulous way to spend half the day on the last one for my trip."
,,Good day out,3.0,,The waterfall Avery is absolutely amazing. If you do one thing then do this. It’s very hilly so I would recommend getting the tram up to the top. The keepers were knowledgeable and pelican feeeding was great. However the bird of pray show was disappointing as it was mainly vultures.
,,Well organized park not enough birds,4.0,,"The whole infrastructure of the park, including the facilities and how it has been set up is excellent, however the selection of birds could definitely have been more"
,,Bucket list day,5.0,,"Our kids have a thing for birds! With no Toucans in Australia this was our little boys, 9, first chance to see a toucan. Just prior to the bird show we asked a staff member if there was any chance at all that he could see a toucan up close after the show, he said sure he can hold them! So our boy got to be the child in the audience who had two toucans land on his arms. The smile on his face I won’t ever forget!!

I would suggest planning your day priority bird wise as it is over quite a large area and the heat/humidity factor takes its toll on walking. The huge aviary was pretty impressive, the bird shows a must do. The gardens are lovely too and a cool off splash in the water park helped give the kids enough energy for the trip home.

We did the MRT /bus option, which took about an hour from the CBD including waiting for the bus. No other tourists on either our way there or back, perhaps more tour groups or taxi’s?"
,,Very good attraction showing birds of all kinds,5.0,,The bird park has all kinds of birds on show and it’s a amazing attraction to see. The shows on offer has two shows on offer and they are worthwhile to see
,,Great Visit,5.0,,"Went to the Bird Park. Used the MRT and bus to get there. Used the tram to get orientated, then walked around the various aviaries and enclosures. In the Lorrie section you can buy some nectar in a cup which the birds will then drink from. They birds can get a bit annoyed if you take the nectar away!! They have all sorts of tropical birds. Worth a visit."
,,It rained!,3.0,,"Was good overall but we couldn’t see one of the shows due to the rain, I was hoping for a free pass but nope!"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,We were immeasurably impressed by the Jurong bird park. It is an absolutely fantastic bird park. The indoor waterfall was great. We sat and had a coffee in the cafe inside the massive aviary with beautiful parrots squawking away in the rafters. Lush. Highly recommend a visit to this amazing place
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"Great place for young families to take the kids or just for a relaxing stroll. Be prepared for a humid day, but lots to enjoy looking at!"
,,Jungle inside the city,5.0,,Jungle inside the city. Very interesting place for nature lover. We feel the nature with birds. Shows are very good
,,Good for family outings,4.0,,Great to spend a day put with Family. Especially enjoy the performances by the bird and birds feeding.
,,"Small and pricey, penguins saved the day",3.0,,"Kind of hard to reach: first you have to take the MRT all the way to the Boon Lay station, then find bus 194 by following the signs inside the shopping centre.

Admission is very expensive (S$30). Paying an extra S$5 for the tram inside the park is recommended - although the area is not very big, it is extremely hot and humid, getting very tiring after a while.

Highlights: high man-made waterfall and penguins."
,,Very nice bird park,4.0,,"Visited with wife and teenagers son. So.many species of Bird can be see. Very well maintained. Don't miss the shows, they are too good. You should be prepared to walk a lot. But nice greenery and so.many birds to see. It feel energetic to be with the bird in park. Nice place to visit , when in singapore"
,,Amazing collection of birds at one place,5.0,,"If you love birds, this is one place you must go when you are in Singapore since it carries so many species of birds around the world that it is like a one stop sees all instead of having to travel to different corners of the world. To start with, the High Fly Show at the open air Amphitheatre is a definite treat to children in particular as those toucans, hornbills and colorful macaws followed the instructions of their trainers and then the finale of hundreds of flamingoes and pelicans swarming the stage was breath taking. Make sure you allot enough time to tour the Park as you probably would need to go through signs in front of cages to see which birds you are watching and then finding them sometimes also takes some effort. I was particularly impressed by the birds of paradise and the birds of prey. Highly recommended!"
,,Great day out with nature,4.0,,"The Bird Park exceeded our expectations, and the web site doesn’t quite explain it in a clear fashion. We really loved the large aviaries...seeing birds in their natural environment. Taking some time to watch, wait, and see what emerged gave us a much better experience than those who just rolled around on the tram (and paid more to do so). Wild birds (eg stork-billed kingfisher) also came to the park to add to the excellent displays.

The shows were OK - a little bit “touristy” for me (but go to the Hawk Conservancy at Andover UK for really great displays where the birds perform as nature intended).

We walked round the whole park, took around 5 hours, and avoided the over-priced restaurants. Had an awful coffee at $5 a cup and then it was full of sugar (beware - this is the local custom), but this didn’t detract from a great day. Had some cute lizards thrown in ... great pics of a lizard in the flamingoes’ drinking trough. Memorable and would do it again.

Just hope they can transition to the new site in 2020 and keep the natural areas working in the same way."
,,Well maintained park with a great collection of birds,5.0,,"We loved the variety of birds and the way they are in kept in large spaces including walkthrough aviaries. The rare blue parrots and macaws, and the lorikeets feeding area were the highlights for us. It can be sunny so be prepared with hats, sunblock and plenty of water."
,,Monday bluez day,5.0,,"After so long of not been to JBP, its has been a great day for me and my family outing.... Its a great workout on a very hot day for us... Overall we enjoy the day there and shall return again some day... Pls add more halal fast food there... Thanks birds..."
,,Amazing Birds Very Friendly,5.0,,This is the first time we have visited Jurong its amazing the variety of birds... But our very favorite part has to be the enclosure where the parrots interact with you it was quite the experience and we got heaps of amazing photos.
,,A fantastic day out,5.0,,"Such a lovely day out. The layout is great and you can take a fun shuttle bus around the whole park that stops at a few stops if you want to walk around.

The lorikeet forest was fantastic, for a few dollars you can buy some food which essentially makes you a tree. At one point, my partner had about 4 lorikeets on her, with one waiting patiently on the side.

The park is laid out well so you can easily find your favourite bird! The birds of prey were awesome.

While we were there the penguins were looking after their eggs and the keeper was telling us all about them. Very cute and interesting.

Thoroughly recommend for all ages."
,,Trip to Jurong Bird Park.,5.0,,Brought my daughter to Jurong Bird Park for the first time. She loved the place soo much. Had an awesome day at there. Will visit again at the new location.
,,Kids are happy,4.0,,My children enjoy the visit so much especially the water play but too bad the time spent at waterplay was cut short due to emergency cleaning and need to wait 1hour for the pool to be open back. Other than that was dissapointed to know that my favourite owl exhibit was close down as I was looking forward to see the owls.
,,Bit sad to hear its moving,5.0,,Somehow the pace of this place is much easier than the other zoos. If you like birds you will love this place. If you are not really a bird fan you will still enjoy the gentle pace of the bird park. Might be a bit strenuous for the elderly. Loved the Ugandan shoebills.
,,For Bird Lovers,4.0,,"Last visited 20 years ago and still as interesting as the first time. Took the train for a trip around the park which was a lot of fun. Then went for a leisurely walk around for a closer look at the wonderful bird life. Plenty of shade as you walk with lots to see, great activity for all the family. Remember your hat and water bottle when walking to keep hydrated!"
,,Most Awesome Place,5.0,,A must visit for everyone managed very well got to see most colourful birds loved the lorry loft experience will go again had a great time shopping
,,Bird Lover's Paradise,4.0,,"If you are happy to walk then there is so much to explore in the Jurong Bird Park that half a day vanishes in the blink of an eye and you are left lamenting all that you have missed out on. Even though we were there with our 3 year old son we still covered most parts of the park. The varieties of birds is immense and the resplendent colours a joy for the viewer.

In half a day we could manage only one of the two shows and two feedings. the penguin feeding turned out to be a dud for us as we are vegetarians and couldn't get around to feeding fish to the penguins with our hands. The lory feeding was much more fun. For SGD 3 you get a small glass of nectar to feed the birds. The lory loft has various levels and criss cross wooden bridges which itself give you an adventure feel. The birds hardly have any nectar - in fact you will find it difficult to finish even half the glass. But they hop on to your hands, shoulders, head and that itself is so much fun. A pair of lories stuck to my head for a good 7-8 minutes before my child shooed them away forcibly.

The Waterfall Aviary was the best area of the lot as you could walk around freely with the birds. My son chased quite a few of them and in general had an amazing time looking for birds hidden in bushes.

The entire park is well planned out though they could have avoided some of the uphill walking. Most enclosures and the birds in them are beautiful especially the penguins and the pelicans. Would recommend at least half a day here and even more if you intend to walk around with little children."
,,Great experience for kids!,5.0,,"This is a really great place for kids, with a lot of variety of colorful birds. The greenery provides good shade, to walk around in sunny weather too."
,,Amazing shows,5.0,,"When you are planing to visit this park- make sure you check their website for attraction closure dates and showtimes.

When visiting ensure to make it for the shows...you will be amazed!

High flyers - must see!!! And they allow photos to be taken after the show...for free.

Suggest not to take the tram, as the park is too small, you can easily walk around."
,,Just Ok,3.0,,"There are variety kinds of colorful birds. But most of them are put in small cages. The space are too small that they couldn't fly. Especially the penguins cage, it's too small for that number of them, not enough space for them to swim enjoyingly. I don't favor the bird show either. The birds couldn't complete their performance. One of the parrots didn't speak and one bird didn't fishish the flying performance through the circles. The host said that 'cause they were old. They were too old then why were the forced to work??? I don't support this kind of entertainment.
I visited Jurong Bird Park because it's included in the tour package. I don't think I will visit again."
,,A morning with feathered friends,4.0,,"Well-designed learning experience with something for everyone. While the numbers of birds are small in comparison to neighbouring countries, they are well maintained. Food and beverage options are decent but rather expensive."
,,Top notch attraction in SG,5.0,,Undeniably one of the best aviation animal attractions globally... Great performance from the two shows they had... Extremely friendly staff... My little girl had a great time there!
,,Nice bird park,4.0,,"Sorry for late review as visited in May 2017.

Do not usually visit zoos etc etc as don’t agree with most of them but as this was touted as free flying with a large variety of birds thought we would visit.

The park is vast with a lot of free flying aviaries where we could feed the birds which was nice to do. The whole park is very natural looking and most of the birds looked well and happy although we did find one or two cages a little small

Went to a number of the shows throughout the day which we found informative and fun.

Would recommend visiting whilst in Singapore although if only there one or two days would not go out of my way."
,,awesome place for kids,5.0,,it is a great place for kids. Very clean and well organized. They have a big wet play area for kids so don’t forget your swimsuit and a towel! We had fun!
,,Park visit was good but disappointed over the limited restaurant.,4.0,,"My children enjoyed their trip there. But my luncheon experience there was a disappointment. They should have at least a fast food restaurant (i.e. Macdonald's, Burger King or KFC or Pizza) outside the entrance and one inside the park. I only saw one Pizza Hut's takeaway outlet inside the park. Then again they are shifting to Mandai soon. Hopefully the new park will include this suggestion. Cheers!!"
,,Birds up close,5.0,,"Truly a must viist for travellers to Singapore.
Good shows in the park and you can get close to the birds like never before.
Be in the park by 10am so you can see all the shows and experience feeding the birds.
The penguin feeding was a great experience for us."
,,Waiting for the new location,3.0,,"Go for the two shows and feed the penguins. Take the tram to listen to the facts about the birds. Apart from this, let's just say I hope that when the park will be opened in the new location everything will be much better."
,,Expensive entry fee,2.0,,Not worth the money. We lived in Singapore 14 years ago and the bird park was fantastic then. We visited in June 2018 and it was very shabby. Run down and not cared for. Hardly any birds. Many cages empty. Compared to other attractions in Singapore this is at the bottom of the list. Very disappointed.
,,Don’t bother with lunch with the parrots,3.0,,"Thought we would pay to have lunch with the parrots. Instead they shuffle you inside to a buffet restaurant & then tell you that you can take a drink or dessert out to the terrace where they do a small bird show. Really not worth the money to do. The advertising picture shows a lovely white table cloth with food & parrots right next to the visitors. It’s nothing like this at all.

Some of the areas of the park are great, mainly the huge netted walk through areas. Others are are very boring with many cages and dark shaded & overgrown areas. You will only interact with birds in the area where they have the lorikeets or in the main bird show.

I visited Kaunda Birdworld in Australia and was sort of expecting something better but was disappointed. There are however an enormous amount of birds but I don’t like looking at them in the smaller cages.

Also in one of their displays they have a picture of a wallaby & joey but have labelled it as a kangaroo which is incorrect.

Hope breakfast with the orangutans are better at the zoo and we haven’t wasted our money."
,,Rainy Day,3.0,,"We were really excited to visit Jurong Bird Park after almost 6 years from our last visit.Sad to say that it raining in the morning and it was drizzling almost the rest of the day. Since we have young children with us, we just had a quick visit in the Lory loft and watched the shows in the afternoon (lucky that the amphitheater is covered!). We didn't get to really enjoy the rest of the park."
,,Excellent attraction,4.0,,This was a great place to visit for the day. A bit of a way out of Singapore central but very easy to find using the train and bus. Lots of different birds to see very informative .
,,"Birds, birds everywhere.",5.0,,Best enjoyed by taking in the sights of each enclosure so that one can view the birds up close instead of the Tram ride as it gives just an overview of the park. Lory Loft and the Waterfall Aviary must not be missed. The Birds of Prey show is again a key attraction.
,,Excellent attraction with even better staff and service,5.0,,"I was not very sure of how exciting a bird park could be, but I was super amazed and impressed by the variety of birds and the quality of shows. Would definitely recommend for a day outing.
Now for the staff - Excellent service and a very jovial, helpful and accommodating staff. It started raining the moment we landed and we were not sure if we will be able to view anything because of the rains, but the staff assured us that they would do whatever they can and also when we requested, they agreed for us to visit again on the same tickets. Luckily we didn't have to come again as the downpour stopped in some time.
I would recommend planning your trip keeping the shows in mind. The two shows which I remember seeing are the ones with the Macaws and the Birds of Prey. All in all a great attraction"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,This was a great day out. Spent 4 hours here with so much to see and do. There were wonderful demonstrations and bird shows. Up close and personal
,,Ok visit to jurong bird park,4.0,,"So v had taken collective tickets for all the 4 parks I.e Singapore zoo, night safari, river safari , and jurong bird park.. so v had to go there and it was like ok if u really like the birds and all then u will enjoy it otherwise u can skip this excursion .. it houses many species of different birds like blue rare Macau and variations in parrots, vultures, sparrows , it also has flamingo which are very cute .. v opted for tram ride to get breathing space and not get tired.. its best when u have so much to cover plus it saves time and energy .. one thing which struck me was the waterfall it was amazing and the sound was coming from it was like wow.. I got literally hypnotic.. I cannot sit hours and hours there listening to that beautiful wonderful melodised sound.. ohh man it was just wow .. it won my heart completely .. so without fail I visit his waterfall inside the park and get lost and n a beautiful thought .."
,,Lovely vist to Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"No disappointments on any quarter whatsoever! An absolutely must do for all animal lovers. Please study the timings for the individual shows; the birds of prey, and the parrots shows, and make it for them. The birds and their keepers are so much fun to watch in interaction rather than in their enclosures. The walk inside the park is rather long between the different bird enclosures. It would be wise to carry water bottles.
A word of caution, the multiple park ticket has to be redeemed at the Zoo first, so it is possible to visit Jurong only after that."
,,Not a nesserary visit in Singapore,3.0,,"It was a lovely park on itself, however, the cages are small and the vegetation too dense to see some of the birds! I will recommend this visit only if you have spare time in Singapore, if not, you will find the Zoo, the river safari and the aquariulm much more impressive..."
,,Wonderful experience!!!,5.0,,It’s a really good place to visit with young children ... there are so many birds which fly freely ... Lory birds interact with the tourists and we can also feed them ... there is a lot to walk around ... there is also a small playing area (water ) where kids can enjoy in swimming wear...young children will definitely live this place .. there is an Indian restaurant right in front which has got tasty dishes ...
,,It is ok,3.0,,Brought my little one there today but she didn't enjoy it as much as the zoo trip. I guess she is too slow to follow the birds.
,,great experience,5.0,,Very good experience in the bird park. A lot of rare species of bird. will go there again next time.not sufficient time to go through the breeding area.
,,BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO VISIT.,5.0,,"Must include this park in the itinerary.Its a half day tour.Beautiful,clean,serene.Various types of birds can be found.Tram service is provided so as to take a tour or get a drop within the park.Walking is preferred as then all the areas are covered.Eatables are available inside.Bird show takes place at about 11am. Very well maintained park.Overall a nice experience."
,,Plenty to do and see. Worth getting an annual membership even for tourists,5.0,,"Went to Jurong bird park during our stay in Singapore. It was really easy to get to by public transport. We took the MRT to Boon Lay and then took the bus 194, which took us right in front of the bird park.
After the high flyers show, we walked around the park and had some lunch. It was very hot. My children spent a long time at the waterplay so we ran out of time to see some of the birds. On leaving the park, we enquired about converting the day tickets to membership and it was a straightforward process after a SGD8 top up (as one of us is a Singaporean, we paid less on the day ticket). We went again the next day and as it was a weekday, we could go on the tram for free as members (otherwise, we would have to pay SGD16 for the whole family). We went to the Rory loft and other places.
If I had noticed the price for the family membership, I would have paid for the membership earlier and then we could have got on the tram to save some walking the first day."
,,Beauty of nature,5.0,,All aspects are best and attractive.my family members and children like very much and talking about it still. Will visit again. Keep up the good efforts.
,,unbelievable sight of different birds trained to perform,5.0,,unique experience of seeing birds behaving in a cordial manner and understanding capacity for abiding and listening and performing various acts as advised by the keeper. Also repeating what is said is something which all must see.
,,Visit after many years not much change,4.0,,"Noting as got much exciting even after 10 years , shocking as anything and everything else in Singapore is ahead of time usually other Asian countries I feel everything else is moved on Accept the bird park Need add more atrraction and innovation"
,,One of my favorites in Singapore,5.0,,"This was a really fun, really cool attraction. It's REALLY out of the way, but worth going to. It's good for about . . . half a day or so. The Aviary was so cool, you could walk up to a lot of the birds and get REALLY close for pictures. The waterfall inside makes for a GREAT photo op.

The parrots area was my favorite, because I love parrots. They had some amazing ones, and even a few show offs.

Just really nice!"
,,Great show,5.0,,My family enjoyed the visit to the park. The two shows viz Kite flyer and birds of paradise were very nice. We had a good time
,,A fun day at the bird park,5.0,,"Though it was drizzling throughout the most part of the morning, it did not hinder much of the scheduled programmes as it went on as scheduled. As most of the enclosures were sheltered, with the tram and an umbrella, it was still manageable for my wife and I and my two young kids at the park."
,,Must visit Singapore attraction!,5.0,,This is a must visit place for nature and bird lovers. The shows are awesome and best part is where you can feed the cute birds! Simply superb place to spend at least half a day!
,,Good experience,4.0,,"An overall fuss free experience, F&B options could be more though. Lory loft was the most popular, too bad the Owls were moved to the Zoo."
,,Moving Preparation ?,3.0,,"I visited there a couple of times. I am not sure whether it is just my feeling or it is real, but I do not see as many birds as I saw when I visited there first time. For example, the 'Lori Loft' - The big cage where we can feed the birds with $3 bird feed, I remember, before as soon as I brought the bird feed, countless birds were approaching me and sit on my arms, shoulders, or head. But now.. really few birds were just stayed on the tree and did not even take a look at the bird feed.."
,,Awesome bird 🐦 park,5.0,,Jurong bird park is amazing many king of bird here I m see lots of different species bird here this best park for children to enjoy and learn about bird and there activity I am highly recommend for this park for children
,,Best Visit for Families and Kids to get all Type of Birds Around Them,4.0,,"Highly Recommended for Kids and Families to Enjoy the Natural Gardens, Lakes and all Sort of Birds in one Place , really good experience to Feed the Birds, one of the best Tour for Kids to get familiar with Different type of Birds"
,,"Fantastic experience, pretty far from town",4.0,,This place is one of the best bird sanctuaries in Asia. Surprising considering how developed Singapore is. Live shows were fantastic. The location is way out of town though. Heard they will be moving to merge with the Zoo soon.
,,Awesome and educational,5.0,,"Visit this attraction way back 2011 with my siblings and I have an awesome experienced.This time I visited the attractiin with my daughter and Mum. Everythings great as usual. My mum and daughter was entertained especially with the programs held in Pool ampitheAther and Hawks Arena. The hawks arena was more sctrict with all the guards around which is better. The only one i missed was the horse backriding tandem with the hunting hawk on the hunters shoulder which looks really awesome. I suggest to take the tram if u are visiting with children.
Everything is this attraction is worth visiting and i recommend this for a family visit."
,,Old but still gold~,3.0,,"This zoo is old and located in a small patch of forest. The trees are all majestic! Birds looks fine but some look tired. The route are hilly and I do feel breahtless as i have to push a pram =)
Good news are they are moving to new location to be together with Singapore Zoo and the rest of the gang in 2020, wait for it!"
,,great family time,5.0,,beautiful birds here and a great place for a full day of fun family time. lovely shows too. The restaurants are alright.
,,Colorful variety of birds,5.0,,"Another great attraction in Singapore, the bird park has a variety of birds from all over the world. The bird shows are the typical shows one sees everywhere, but still worth seeing. Walking amongst all the aviaries is pleasant and easy. Habitats are well-maintained, and the staff are knowledgable and caring."
,,Wonderful place for family,5.0,,"We visited jurong bird park with family and a toddler. At the entrance itself, you are able to take buggy cars for kids at a rental. Or you may take the tour bus. Food is available at various cafes within the park. Must see the hawk show and parrot show at the amphitheatre. Also must experience feeding the lories in the Australia section. Recommended for all ages as it is a totally different experience and really worth visiting. The park opens at 8:30 am and takes about 4-5 hours to cover the entire park; time may change if you have small kids :)"
,,Good for holiday,5.0,,"Very nice garden and all the birds are healthy very good friendly happy to see them, we spent all day walking here, love this place"
,,Paradise for Bird lovers,5.0,,"If you are a bird enthusiast or a passionate about photography then this is the place to be. The facility is superb for observing birds up close and brushing up on bird trivia. You can feed exotic birds in an aviary, and feed yourself at the cafe or restaurant at the park. Motorised electric vehicle available for the elderly to cover the long distance at a nominal cost of $20 for 2 hours"
,,A fabulous and diverse collection of birds,5.0,,"This bird park is outside of the city to the west, and is well worth a visit. I have never seen so many diverse and colourful types of birds in one location. The layout of the park is impressive. There are the open air enclosures with pelicans, the closed enclosures with hawks, and the walk through enclosures of huge proportions with other diverse birds. I definitely recommend that you add this to one of the places to visit when in Singapore, because I doubt whether you will find anywhere better. A practical tip, not advertised in any guidebook that I have seen, is that if you arrived in Singapore by Singapore Airlines you get 10% off the admission price, but you need to produce your boarding pass (the electronic version is fine)."
,,Great park with the coolest show,5.0,,"Nearly every park we went to in Singapore had a show, but Jurong's blew the rest out of the sky! Was a really cool mix of funny bird acts that kept the kids laughing."
,,Beautiful park with birds from the entire world,4.0,,We particularly enjoyed the hornbills and the cassowary. We had never seen such a collection of exotic birds prior to visiting Jurong.
,,Fantastic family park,4.0,,"This park is an amazing little venue. It has birds from all around the world, great shows and a waterpark for the kids. We loved walking around at a slow pace and viewing the birds we don't see in North America. Beautiful"
,,Family-friendly Adventure!,5.0,,"Visiting Jurong Bird Park in Singapore is a family-friendly adventure, to see various bird species, from parrots to penguins. You can also ride the 'Panorail' (in air-conditioned comfort) for a panoramic look at the bird park.
Set on 50 acres (20 hectares) of verdant green space, Jurong Bird Park is home to thousands of birds across hundreds of species. We can enjoy quality family-time at the various attractions, such as the ‘Birds & Buddies’ show, which runs twice a day and features characters in colourful costumes. We need to check the show schedule at the park when we arrive, as other shows too take place during the day.
We stopped by the African wetlands exhibit to see African birds in their habitat of ferns, palms and native-style pavilions and learnt about the environmental balance in which birds and humans both live. We also entered a misty jungle-style habitat at the Waterfall Aviary. We didn’t miss the penguin exhibit, which features an underwater viewing gallery to watch the penguins. We were able to feed fish to the penguins in the open arena on the opposite side.
We watched the show ""Birds of Prey"", featuring vultures, hawks, owls, etc., beautifully trained and handled by the Park attendants. The next show was called ""High Flyers"", featuring multi-coloured Parakeets and Macaws, performing flying feats, and showing amazing skill by flying through loops and obeying the commands of their trainers. One Macaw was able to recite songs in Chinese and call out numbers from one to ten in three languages!! It was a tremendous experience, to be specially enjoyed by young and old. The finale was a grand parade of Pelicans and Flamingos!
It is truly astounding that the trainers have shown patience and spent countless hours training these birds.
A ""NOT TO BE MISSED"" visit!"
,,Birds of a feather stick together,5.0,,You must go and see this the bird park is just wonderful and the show they put on is out of this world . Well done Jurong Bird Park
,,Nice place to Visit with kids,4.0,,"Before visiting Jurong Bird Park, I was thinking, will it be worth...! will I find something exciting in a bird park...! I mean it's just the birds what else....! with these thoughts I landed here. To my surprise, it was far beyond my expectations.... too good.. :). It took 30 Minutes for me to get there by taxi from Park Royal Hotel on Kitchener. Once in, I moved around a little bit and found that there is a High Flyers show at 11AM (it repeats at 3PM) at Pools Amphitheatre. This is one of the best (highly recommended) its a 30 Min show ends at 11.30 and you get to see almost all the exotic birds.
One more recommendation, please bring cart for kids if possible. they provide electric scooters as well on rent. it will be a long walk. you can always hop on to the trams (Chargeable) but its worth it (for little heavy ppl like me :) ).
In the end I would rate it to be amongst top 10 places to visit in Singapore if you are on a family trip.. Have fun and enjoy... :)"
,,Fun and entertaining,4.0,,Have a fun time with my baby there. Travel in tram provide us with ease of going around attractions. Only downside is the baby changing room is dirty and not equipped well enough for families with babies.
,,shows are the best never miss it,5.0,,"Jurong bird does not have a direct train or bus . taxis are cheaper in singapore . you can see the whole park in about 2 hrs ,but the show timings are spread throughout the day .Make sure you get there on time so you don't miss the shows .The park has restrooms and water area where drinking water can be filled . Tram ride needs the entry ticket but you can hop on and off as many times as you wish ."
,,High in the sky,5.0,,"This place is one of a kind. A special zoo for birds. A great collection of birds with some hard to find species like the dinosaurs descendants (I adore the emu and the cassowary) and close encounters with many of them. You can enjoy the shows of the Kings of the Sky the birds of prey like hawks, vultures and owls and the High Flyers show mainly the cute parrots. There is also a nice water-park for kids. You can also combine your ticket with other parks, the zoo, the night safari and the river safari, but these parks are not in the same area."
,,Nice,3.0,,The place is nice for hangout especially with kids. Easy to go and have various type of birds species.
,,Worth a look even if you aren't a bird lover,5.0,,"Unless you actively hate birds, plan at least a short visit (but note that the aviaries are closed about 15 minutes before the official closing time). The aviaries are huge. One has a 30 metre waterfall inside of it and a bridge from which you can look down on the waterfall. There are a lot of rare birds here, and some good explanatory displays. I particularly liked the blue macaws - I had seen pictures of them, but until my visit, I had no idea they were nearly 1 metre long from their beaks to the tips of their tail feathers. Be warned; the stench from the bird droppings is also incredible - the bird population is packed into a much smaller space than in the wild."
,,Great Day Out for Young Family,5.0,,"We visited Jurong Bird Park expecting to stay a few hours and ended up spending the whole day. What an amazing place. We visited with 3 adults and 2 children (6yo and 7yo) and there was something for everyone. The birds of prey show was particularly well done with some unique birds that you wouldn't normally encounter in this type of show. The bird park also so many collections of species you wouldn't see elsewhere (macaws, hornbills and toucans in particular. But if these highlights still aren't enough there is a vast collection of other birds on show. The area is bigger than we expected but there's a train that runs around the park. We walked most of it but took the train when it was time to go home. Also take bathers because there's a fantastic water playground where the kids can play and refresh themselves with some water play. Excellent change facilities available and if you forget the bathers you can buy at the shop at reasonable prices. But no bathers no play! All in all a fantastic day out. Well done Jurong Bird Park. Note that it's quite some way out of town. Not sure how you'd go getting there by public transport - we used Grab and were taken door to door."
,,Not to be missed park,5.0,,"This place is away as compared to other sights ,
.It is a very bib bird park spread over approx 20 Hectres of land .One can find almost all type of beautiful,large, small, coloured species from all over world. One should spend minimum 5 hours to have feel of the bird park. if one can not walk long ,hopping trams are available at nominal charge. There are beautiful shows which are not to be missed. One will find clean toilets and water for drinking fountains everywhere."
,,Yet another 'must do' in Singapore especially if you have kids,5.0,,It was simply amazing. We enjoyed the Kings of the Sky show and the Pelican Chit Chat. The waterfall arena was simply amazing .....cannot do justice to this place with a few words because there were so many wonderful aspects. The aviaries have been done with so much thought to detail its just really wonderful. And as a bonus there is this huge play area for kids which allows parents to catch their breath after a long walk inside. But please remember to take your kids swim suits as otherwise they miss out on just one part of the play area...
,,Awesome,5.0,,Definitely worth the visit. Cab fare is about $20 from the city centre. Make sure you catch the bird show. Took my elderly parents who caught the free tram from. Point to point while we walked. You will need to walk to see all the displays. Takes about 4 hours to do the park if you walk. There is a steep hill to walk up during one section so keep that in mind with kids. Looking forward to seeing it again when it moves to the zoo precinct.
,,Well trained birds.,5.0,,Huge collection of birds from across the world. Especially the predatory birds. All birds are very well trained. The predatory bird show is not to be missed. The main bird show is excellent.
,,Is a great price to bring children to go,4.0,,"Being able to get close to the bird,suggest go early because can have a look for many show. Is a good place to enjoy family day at here"
,,Fun day out,4.0,,Jurong Bird Park has been one of our family faves since the kids were born. It's a great place to spend time and finish of with the fantastic playgrounds! The only minus point is that the birds may not always be visible in the cages. So that expectation has to be managed during a visit. Otherwise it's a lovely way to spend over half a day!
,,Bijan’s Experience,4.0,,"The birds park was really good. Lot of birds and the tram ride was helping to drop people at different spots to visit main attraction. If you have kids ranging from 7 and above, I am sure they will enjoy it. There are many events that is there to see, like birds show in amphitheatre at 11.15 am and 3 pm, feeding the birds and specifically Young kids will love this. The park is we’ll maintained and there are ample options of restaurant , food stalls. I have given 4 star as I see they have photographers inside park who will take photo of yours and sell it to you which is pricey. The options are also less to customise to your affordability. But it is a place worth visiting if you are in Singapore."
,,love their shows!,4.0,,not to miss their birds show. well trained parrots.plan ur visitation in their webpage suggestions. it helps! Areas of improvement. Kids play area are dated and water is quite dirty.
,,Disappointed,3.0,,We were looking forward to going to the bird park however we feel very disappointed in what we saw. It is a big let down after going to the zoo & river safari. We felt some of the birds were in quite confined spaces - the ones that we could see !We wouldn't go back again
,,Birds I have never seen before in some incredible settings,5.0,,"This is a bit out of the way from some other attractions but an easy taxi ride ( about $16S from Orchard Rd area) gets ou there in about 20 mins. Some amazing birds on display here (I never knew giant pigeons existed!) The two shows on offer showcase some amazing birds demonstrating some normal behaviours. The Macaws and raptors were very impressive. Use the tram to get around if you are a bit weary.(We used the Parkhopper Plus ticket for all 4 wildlife parks and it included the trams for all parks too, it is good value). Lots of meal options and snacks, a kids water playground and cafe too."
,,Park Premises looks run down,2.0,,The park really needs a makeover. As I walked along the premises to view the exhibits I can't help but notice that everything looks old and unappealing to the eyes. I am greeted mostly by the unwelcoming smell of bird stench. Its understandable to have the smell but perhaps it could be kept in check by regular cleaning?The water in which the birds are frolicking in seems dirty. E.g the penguins and flamingos. The washroom also needs some maintenance. The taps are not working well. I had to keep pressing on in order to wash my hands.
,,Intertesting and informative,4.0,,"A delightful experience of the Jurong Bird Park, first time visitor although been to Singapore many times. Definitely do the tram first to get your bearing and then use it to avoid the steep climbs."
,,Under no circumstances miss this!,5.0,,"Amazing collection of birds, with great attention to housing them in as natural an environment as possible. A huge emphasis on conservation. Don't miss the displays as they were great fun and hugely informative. Eateries are not why you go there, but you won't go hungry. The best is at the entrance but the staff in the others could not have been more professional and courteous. Friday, 10 Aug, we went to the cafe at Lory Loft - young lady working on her own, very busy, dealt with everyone calmly and professionally, and still made us feel welcome. My 8-year old god-daughter had to be dragged away - feeding the Lories was a highlight, though she was mesmerised by the displays too..."
,,Beautiful.....,5.0,,"A must visit place in your iternary , parrots paradise was my favourite, do all shows and try to visit by trams, ask your tour operator to book it with tram only, you can stop at your favourite spot and hop on in another tram.

Beautiful place with beautiful birds."
,,Let down,2.0,,High flyers show was not as earlier. Big disappointment Hawk show was ok ok Birds were few Take your call and skip Incase time is short
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,I like the shows and its nice seeing some birds roaming around freely. There were many varieties of birds around which is eye opening for me and my partner. Thank you. I would come back again when the bird park is moved to the zoo.
,,Beautiful is an Understatement,5.0,,One of the most wonderful opportunities to connect with Nature. Very well maintained and you get to see the world of birds in a very friendly environment.
,,Good place,4.0,,"Good place, nice shows, children like it very much, sepecially the feeding lory at the Lory Loft. It's pity that the water fun at Birdz of Play could not be play without swimming suits."
,,A lovely bird park,5.0,,"We came here near closing time, about 5pm. Probably because of the time there were very few people, it was very tranquil. Stayed till almost 7pm, they close at 6pm, rangers didn't find us earlier. Need about 4 hours to see everything"
,,ONE OF MY FAVOURITE SPOTS,5.0,,"Amazing is the word that comes to my mind when you see the variety of birds, the way they are taken care of in their near natural habitats, the young and enthusiastic staff, the bird shows and the entertainment that this place offers. My kids loved it, especially when they took photographs with pelicans and other birds."
,,Jurong is on the move.,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is still enjoyable and has a great variety of birds on show. It will soon be moving to a new site out with the Zoo, River Safari and new hotels."
,,Day at Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,Is enjoyable however the whether is too hot due to the whether. Nice show and is very educational . .
,,Fantastic,5.0,,The bird park is really worth a visit. Huge scale and close-up access to the wildlife is amazing. Got some great photos.
,,For a bird lover in some of the birds are difficult to see in the cages,3.0,,"Quite disappointing as you can hardly see the birds because of the cages, except where you can walk in and observe the various species of birds. The Lori park is very interesting as you can feed the loris with nectar that you purchase for 3 dollars. The Parrot paradise is good as well and shows are interesting. The hatching centre is very good."
,,Disappointed,1.0,,Really disappointed with the park yes it have allot of birds but nothing is worth it but the show's and if u miss the show u miss everything not worth the walk and even tho my kids live animals specially birds they got bored.
,,Too expensive and boring,1.0,,"As title above, I brought my families which from China and they found that it was too expensive and boring. We went at noon and waited for the events to start, but the trams does not stop at the places where event played. So we need to walk. We paid for the tram and we still need to walk to the play event."
,,Well Done Jurong Bird Park!,5.0,,"Even as a local, we visit JBP once a while too. In this visit, we brought a China student who was in a exchange program with our daughter to JBP as JBP is the largest bird-park in Asia. As a local, we see that JBP is working hard introducing new animals and did many revamps on the park. We enjoyed the new features (as what we saw previously were no longer around), and also the shows. We saw many tourists visiting the park but sadly, we the locals were very little. We hope JBP continue to work hard attracting our own peoples to visit the park."
,,1 for 1 deal was very attractive,4.0,,"My friend and I were attracted by the 1 for 1 deal for all the parks, thus we chose to visit Jurong Bird Park which we had both visited during our childhood. We were impressed by the many exhibits as well as the tram which could bring us to see the various exhibits when we got tired, since the park was huge. Also, the bird shows at certain timings of the day was awesome and audience interactive too, so if you volunteer you can easily be wowed by the intelligence of the birds! Overall, I felt that it was an amazing trip down to Jurong Bird Park again to relive my childhood memories."
,,A good park to go with family especially kids,4.0,,"In a park we can see diverse birds in the globe. Taking a tram is recommended. 세계의 각종 새를 볼 수 있고, 맹금류의 쇼를 볼 수 있는 공원. 트램을 이용하면, 정류장마다 내려서 관람하고 다음 정류장까지 이동하면 편하다. 나이 드신 분들은 트램을 타고 관광하기도 한다."
,,Amazing Birds in Flight performance.,4.0,,"A great show, free, that showcased a large variety of birds. Very professionally run and entertaining for families. The little kids were spellbound. The performances are twice a day and we saw the morning one at about 11 am. Walking the grounds afterwards we could see some of the performers in their cages. Good places to get a snack or lunch in the bird park."
,,unseeen birds,5.0,,oh u must visit this place and take a walk u can see the most exotic bird ever and can u blv there are more than 20 types of parrots and then the flemingos...its lovely live show there and its surely a park one must visit
,,Amazing and Serene Experience,4.0,,"It's a very well kept bird park and I loved all the species they have there. I especially enjoyed the section where you could feed the birds. The food is sold right there, so the birds are protected from outside food. They come to you eat the food fearlessly and you can pet them. It's a different kind of experience than just looking at them from far. It was very satisfying for the soul."
,,A morning at Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,A wide variety of birds in the open as well as in large netted areas. 2 shows of interest as well as bird feeding. Lovely to stroll around but a tram is available if preferred.
,,Not just for the birds,4.0,,It's a bit of a hike to Jurong Bird Park. The East West MRT line will get you as far as Boon Lay station where you can take a bus or a taxi for the last leg of your journey. Buy a voucher on Klook and convert it to tickets at one of the self service machines at the entrance. We watched the King of the Skies show and enjoyed it even though the rah rah commentary became somewhat tedious. The highlight for us was the Lorrie Loft where the Lorikeets have a huge space to zoom around in and are more than happy to pester the visitors for food and attention. Make sure your ticket includes a tram ride to help you traverse the big park in the heat.
,,A trip to Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"Why Jurong Bird Park has been bring human being A bird life together over 40 years ago ? You can pick up the Mrt For Begin...than change A bus.. far away from City center but, the landscape All the way .. so Beautiful."
,,Not great unless you are a die hard bird fan,3.0,,"Must attend various shows and live feeding sessions. Otherwise there is not much unless you are a die hard bird fan

Don't miss following shows:
10:00 AM: Kings of the Skies at Hawk Arena
10:30 AM: Penguin Encounter at Penguin Coast
11:00 AM: High Flyers Show at Pools Amphitheatre"
,,Amazing variety.,5.0,,"The sheer number of species is unbelievable. Well maintained, visitor friendly, and excellent for the whole family. Plan to spend the whole day, but figure out the show times so that you can get the most out of it. Try to keep the noise down, we were disappointed that some visitors couldn't seem to remember that noise could make the birds uncomfortable."
,,Jurong Bird Park is awesome!,5.0,,"We love the bird show very much, especially my children. They enjoy to ride the tram go around the park. The flamingos and scarlets are lovely, beautiful color. Pizza is available inside the park, 1 big slice = 7 singapore dollar. We suggest the pizza staff to always control and clean up the table and chair for customers in outdoor. Anyway, Jurong bird park is extremely recommended place to visit. Thank you guys!"
,,I will visit again,4.0,,Nice to come back again and again as 1 whole day is not enough. Next time I visit I bring with me my parents and parents-in-law. A place to unwind with nature loving ambience and most of all the birds of species that bring a lot of joy specially to the children.
,,A fun day out!,4.0,,"Having lived in Singapore for over 3 years I thought it was high time to visit the Jurong Bird Park. My mother was visiting from Australia and she loves birds so thought we would venture out. We caught the train out and then connected to a bus which took us straight there (so easy)! I wanted to get there for the bird shows, the first one started at 10am and the next was at 11am. The first one was Kings of the Skies which was teaching you about Hawks and Vultures - excellent show! The second was probably more amusing which was High Flyers. We also went through the Lorry Lorikeet section where the birds were very friendly and would crawl onto your hands and shoulders. I was actually surprised at how big the complex was and there was certainly lots to see. It is a fair walk to get around all the park so suggest you buy a ticket for the train. Singapore does these attractions so well! Recommend a visit if you have an interest in birds but definitely make it for the shows. We left before the feeding times but I am sure that would be interesting as well."
,,Jurong Bird Park Singapore,4.0,,I like the walk-in aviary which had a man-made waterfall.. Good variety of birds and lovely landscape..
,,I loved the waterfall,4.0,,"I love this place. It wasn't crowded when we visited. Very quiet, beautiful place to listen to the birds. And then that waterfall!"
,,SANDY,1.0,,"Very disappointed and all birds been feed and we don't have a chance to wait for the birds to come near us. Worst is raining and all birds is not around to view much. Anyway, we won't go again."
,,Show is the best,5.0,,Excellent facilities and so many beautiful birds. Especially the show held a few times a day was wonderful and exciting!
,,could spend a whole day here,5.0,,great enclosures for the birds. By the time you walk around all the enclosures and see the 2 bird shows you could end up spending the whole day here so dont start too late.
,,Such a 7th heaven,5.0,,"Beside the fabulous singapore zoo,stopping by in jurong bird park is also a must. You will experience lots of various of birds and you will feel like in heaven especially when you hear the birds chirping or singing. Dont forget to watch the birds show too...."
,,Nice but...,4.0,,"I have rather mixed feelings regarding this park. I went with my 12 year old son and we generally enjoyed the park and the shows. However, transportation back home was a nightmare, as we hadn't found out about Grab at the time (yes, our mistake). But the park closes way after the last buses leave towards the city center, so we basically got stranded and had to use an expensive limo service to get back. And it's FAR from the center!"
,,Lovely environment for the birds,5.0,,It's a great place to see birds in somewhat natural habitat. There are more than 4000 birds. The shows and the chitchat are a must for those who are visiting the place. One should have all the timing details where they should be at what time so catch up with the beautiful shows they offer
,,Beautiful Park,4.0,,Haven't been here since 1988. The park is well looked after. The bird show was fabulous. If you like birds would recommend when visiting Singapore. Taxi from city s$16
,,Day Trip to Meet the Birds,5.0,,"What a wonderful experience we had at the Jurong Bird Park. We were pleasantly surprised at the lush surroundings throughout the Park. Although stranded for about half an hour through a heavy downpour, this did not deter us once the skies had cleared, to walk the easy paths to each exhibit. There were magnificent species macaws, hornbills to be seen as well as the every-hungry lorikeets which demanded feeding. The flamingos and birds of prey were amazing, so to, the High Flyers Show and the Grand Finale was a showstopper!"
,,The shows are definitely worth a watch,4.0,,"The birds here are amazing. The bird park is very well maintained. Try avoiding the rainy season as the bird shows can get canclled. The highlight is definitely the bird shows. Also a small note flamingos stink alot. I couldn't even stand the smell from 10 feet away the enclosure area. Another place you should definitely visit is the Lori aviary where you can feed the birds while they sit on your hands, a small 3$ price tag for the feeding. They only come on your hand if they are hungry"
,,A good day out,4.0,,"Really easy to get to, catch a bus from the MRT station and it stops right outside (you can use your SMRT tourist card on these busses) include a tram ticket with your entry tickets, hopping on and off the tram can save you a lot of walking on a hot day. We found some of the caged birds a bit hard to see but the aviary is the star, you get to wander around in the forest wilt the birds flying around you. The park is very well laid out, beautiful waterfall and streams. Watch out for the pelicans in the trees above your head....we just missed a bird poo shower really interesting birds of prey show, some huge birds and audience participation. Getting back to town is really easy, the bus back to the MRT stops on the opposite side of the highway (use the underpass). One last point, we found the staff here awesome, really helpful"
,,A really pleasant park with good hands on activities,4.0,,The park offers a good opportunity to see lots of interesting birds and has a fair amount of information on the animals. The shows were entertaining but the highlight for me was feeding the lories; these little birds are beautiful and will happily perch or climb on you when you're feeding them.
,,Excellent Experience,5.0,,"The park is one of the best or I just say the only best one in the world. Clean, well planned and a great collection of birds from across the world. Dedicate a whole day so that you don’t need to rush and also buy the tram ride tickets for sure."
,,Lovely Brid Santuary,5.0,,"Just a joy to visit, food selection was good, easy to stroll and shows was very entertaining. Very friendly staff and service."
,,Beautiful setting and gardens with amazing birds,5.0,,Jurong Bird Park is such a pleasure to visit. It has good signage to inform about the endangered status of many of the birds. The Park seems to have a good breeding program for endangered birds. The upgraded penguin exhibit was great. Our one year old grandson could get a good look at penguins swimming up close.
,,Our son first day in Jurong Bird Park.,3.0,,Few places still can be improve. But the customer services to all the staff there are excellent! Keep up the good work!
,,Not so child friendly,3.0,,There wasnt a high chairs at the restraunts for young children to eat on. The food choice was very limited.
,,Enjoy the trip,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the whole trip, especially the bird shows. And we are so happy to see the pretty birds and penguins!"
,,"Great place to visit, but allow a day",4.0,,"The bird park is a long ride on metro and then a bus ride to the park.
But the lory loft was worth it. You can buy lory feed and the birds in the huge aviary swoop down to feed from your hand- a great experience.

Some of the cages seem a bit small but most are designed with bird's requirements in mind.
I would have appreciated some rest areas with shade/cover to help with the relentless heat, but as it outdoor park, not much else can be done.
Buy tickets on line for 10% discount"
,,Good bird park,4.0,,"If you are a bird lover you’ll love this place. We visited in the morning, it is a fairly small park and there were not many people there. Saw lots of colorful parrot varieties. Most cages are situated in a way that you cannot get good photos of the birds, ie glass or chained fence. If you are not a bird and animal lover then you might want to skip this one."
,,A Great place for children,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a very good natural reserve and a park. There are so many different varieties of birds. The park is built up very nicely. The birds are on a perfect display. If you have children with you while on a trip to Singapore, then please take them there. Children would just absolutely love it. Have fun!"
,,Birds & tropical forest in the city,4.0,,"A recommended place to visit in Singapore city for nature lovers. Experience tropical forest atmosphere with birds flying around you. I visited this park 20 years ago, and this infrastructures although showed signs of its age, seemed to be well maintained. Vegetation has grown considerably but I could only see 2 paradise birds and the Macau numbers seemed to be much less than decades ago. The Macaus used to be put on display outside without cage but now are confined.
But I like the embedded educational messages during the bird shows that teach awareness of the dwindling habitat for animal in the wild."
,,Fantastic experience with family!,5.0,,"Brought my wife and kids to the jurong bird park on weekends and our whole family had a great time. There were many activities and shows available for the kids, and the service staff was attentive and provided good service. Weekends can get quite crowded with many people also visiting the park. Overall, a good experience!"
,,Jurong Bird Park - pleasant surprise!,5.0,,"We spent 5 hrs walking through the bird park and were pleasantly surprised and the quality of the park. They have done a great job with the animals, presentation of them and the surroundings that are in the park. (the waterfall was our favorite other than the birds)

The bird park is being moved to a new location by the zoo in 2020 so get your visit in for the current location soon!"
,,Great bird park,4.0,,This little gem surprised us. the bird park is really very good. the shows are a little bit 'cheesy' but tolerable. the quality of the birds is outstanding. Its out of the way but well worth visiting. Not one of the big ones to visit but if you are running out of things to do I would suggest definitely doing it. Its at least a 4-6 hour visit. penguins are excellent
,,Nice,4.0,,"We visited the bird park after the zoo, so we found it a little underwhelming. It was also really hot with a lot of hills to climb with our 4 year old - so things got pretty tiring quickly. I would recommend it only if you are really into bird watching. Like the Zoo, it has a great outdoor water area for kids though."
,,Better than expected!,5.0,,"I am not a big bird fan, but this park was really good. So many different exotic birds, a huge beautiful aviary and a very large area to walk around and just enjoy the rainforest along with the free flying winged friends.
...I honestly didn't know there was more than one type of toucan. xD"
,,Great place for children,5.0,,Visited there many times. Child likes here very much especially when feeding the bird in the park. Will come to visit again.
,,Jurong bird restoration is very good food,5.0,,"Chicken pizza very nice food and legveni pasta good lava kayak, ice cream, coffee, chicken pasta, and storage all food is good"
,,"Absolutely wonderful !! Lush greenery, beautiful birds",5.0,,"Absolutely wonderful !! Lush greenery, beautiful birds . DO not miss feeding the parrots. They are so friendly and beautiful. Highlight were the bird shows. Try to reach by 11.30, so that you can see shows at 3.30 and 4.30 ..They are must watch..Definitely a repeat attraction"
,,Lorry Lofts..Wow!!!,5.0,,"An amazing and wide variety of birds will please the children and the elders alike.The shows are also interesting.Dont miss the feeding of the lorry lofts,its once in a lifetime experience.
However the park is far away from central singapore (about an hour drive).Also finding a cab back is time consuming"
,,Fabulous High Flyers Show,4.0,,"We both enjoyed walking around the Bird Park being fascinated by the variety of birds on display, not to mention every colour under the rainbow. The High Flyers Show was awesome, what a collection of magnificent birds, the training undertaken was incredible. The presenter was engaging and directed the show with great enthusiasm and humor, used to perfection. We thoroughly recommend the Jurong Bird Park to anyone visiting Singapore."
,,Must visit Tourist spot,5.0,,"The types of birds and the way they are trained are worth watching. This is one of its own kind of experience. Not only children, even elders like the Park."
,,good experience,4.0,,"a) bird show was interesting
b) it would be good to have more cafe outlet serving lunches
c) it was raining on my visit. it would be good if there are more shelters.
d) the walk to the Waterfall is tough for the elderly. it would be good it is more elderly friendly."
,,Great for kids,5.0,,Really nice park with beautiful birds and nice installations. We appreciated how we can see the birds in a natural environment.
,,A worthwhile visit,5.0,,"We almost did not go to Jurong Bird Park because the reviews on TripAdvisor were so mixed. We were glad we made the effort as it was an excellent day out.

Getting there - we took the MRT (Boon Lay MRT) and then crossed over to the bus terminal and got the 194 bus which drops you off just outside the park (this is contrary to what Google Maps will tell you - it says to catch the bus from a different location; this is incorrect). It takes about 70-80 minutes to get to Jurong Bird Park from central Singapore.

Layout - The park is well laid out and as it is situated on the side of a hill you do quite a bit of uphill and downhill walking. For those who do not want to walk around the park there is a tram that circles the park and costs $5 per adult for unlimited hop on hop off.

The Park - We loved the shows, especially the High Flyers Show (sit in the middle just below half way if you want to have a good chance of being selected for audience participation), the Lory Loft where the birds sit on your arm, shoulders and head to get food or nibble at your cap and the Hornbills & Toucans display. The Parrot Paradise is also worthwhile. The Breeding & Research Centre and Bird Discovery Centre are also good (both are air conditioned and also provide interesting educational material and the chance to see birds being incubated and new hatchlings).

We found the park to be clean and the bird cages were well maintained. There were plenty of staff all over the park ensuring that the surrounds were kept neat and tidy.

Food & Water - There are a number of food outlets across the park and free water refill stations across the park so make sure you bring a water bottle with you. We had lunch at the Hawk Cafe which has a range of local food for around $8 - just remember to get a stamp to come back in after lunch as you access the cafe through the exit shop."
,,Brilliant place to see birds,5.0,,"It's a massive place that has over a hundred species of birds, most of which are free to roam around. Some birds are placed in cages, which was heartbreaking to see.However, the surroundings are natural.

Take the tram when you're here. Otherwise, you're in for a long, long walk. Don't forget to enjoy the bird show. It was brilliant, to say the least."
,,Family experience of birds in natural surroundings,4.0,,"This is a pleasant, family orientated bird park with many varieties of birds in large aviaries. There is a canopied hop on- hop off train on wheels to convey people around the park at a low cost. The pathways are wide and suitable for wheelchairs and the unsteady but there are inclines which could make pushing strollers or wheelchairs hot work. Bring an umbrella, a water bottle, a sunhat and a camera.
Bird feeding is a fun experience in The Loft which is at train station one. The Waterfall requires more careful supervision of family members as there are some obstacles and ponds. Supervision is required in the park generally, this is not a place for children to roam or run on ahead. Bathrooms are clean and marked on the map provided at the ticket office."
,,Jurong Bird park visit,5.0,,It was a good experience in the bird park. Dont miss the bird shows...Its a must watch if you are visiting the Jurong Bird park. Plan your trip according to the timing of these shows..Enjoyed alot with my family.
,,4-in-1 ticket.,5.0,,"We got there by public transport and it was easy enough. We took the East-West MRT line and got off at Boon Lay, where we followed signs to the bus interchange and took Bus No. 194, which takes you to the front of the park.

If you can, it's worth catching the shows. Token feeding (for S$2) of the African Penguins near the entrance was a highlight. We spend about 4 hours at the park.

I bought the 4-in-1 park hopper ticket. I paired Jurong bird park with River Safari, followed by Rainforest Lumina (a separate ticket, not covered in the 4-in-1 ticket) in the one day. Looking back, I think it was a good decision.

To get between Jurong Bird Park and Singapore Zoo, there is a shuttle for S$6pp, but the person at the stand (at front of the bird park) told us it only operates on the hour. We just missed one, so we were going to line up for the taxi, wanting to not waste time. The person at the shuttle stand, knowing that another couple was also going to the Singapore zoo instead to offered organise immediate transport to the zoo immediately for S$40 (S$20 per couple). We took it. The driver got us to Singapore zoo in less than 20 minutes.

Remember to take an Umbrella."
,,Must visit when in Singapore,5.0,,"I was travelling with my parents ages 75 and with my daughter aged 4 to singpore and visited hiring bird park
This is a must see
At the time I thought may be it would not be fun for me
But I was so wrong as I had a great time there
It’s made so beautiful inside
The lory loft and the ivory waterfall are the best sections.
It was amazing.
I got the feeding of the birds In the water fall section and also the feeding of the pelicans
It is recommended to do all the shows and feeding as you can interest with the birds at that time.
It is a full day activity and do not club any thing else with this.
The best part is that you can rent prams and an. Electric scooter so my father aged 75 did not need to walk at all
He could move in it every where even the pram was acessable thorough out the park
It was truest age friendly for young children to senior citizens
Wheel chairs are available on hire too

The cost of the scooter was 20 dollars for 3 hours and 5 dollars per hour there after
It was a good experience and fun for all ages"
,,Family and Tourist Must Go,4.0,,Jurong Bird Park as usual never fails to excite our children. The children has a lovely time viewing the infinite species of birds and the performance.
,,A LOT of bird species,5.0,,"First time for me to see flamingo, penguin, pelican, and there's a whole lot more to see. Otherwise, I could only see them from Discovery channel and animal books. Bring your kids for them to enjoy birds and nature."
,,Nice and joyfull park,5.0,,"Nice,big,distractive park.i enjoy it with my sister,mother and my son,was very nice for all of us. Also have many distractive for children,small pool,tram."
,,Good day out,5.0,,One of a good spot to spend a day with family or friends. Lots of species of birds from all over the world. Interactive and educative shows. You can even feed the birds at one of the enclosure as well. Highly recommended.
,,Worth A Visit - Young Kids - Dont forget swimming constumes,5.0,,"The way to plan the itinary out for the visit is to first find out which are the shows and where . I was travelling with young kids and what we did was first took a tour of the whole place via the tram which gave us an idea of what are the different attractions in the place. ( You can get the same by the map as well but a quick tour gives a different perspective )
* We mapped out the different shows that we wanted to see and made sure that we cover the adjacent areas and attractions.
* Make sure that you get to feed the birds, its a wonderful activity :)

Downside -
The only downside was they had a kids playing area with fountains and swings for the kids. A part of the area was only accessible if the kids were wearing a swimming costume. The swimming Costumes over there were exorbitant and hardly any choice and we had a hard time explaining that to the kids."
,,Kids had a blast!,5.0,,"Our 1st trip to a bird park and I knew it had to be Jurong Bird Park! Check online for cheaper deals.

Plan your trip before you go. The shows are dependant on weather so best to allocate the whole day there. You can do all the feedings as well as the 'chit chats' which are informative.

The rare blue macaws are a sight to behold. Its critically endanged so.... Don't miss it!

Before you leave, visit the Birds of Play for a wonderful session at the water play park! Bring change of clothes.

Overall, thus place doesn't disappoint."
,,The Best bird park,5.0,,I don't know why but I could spend most of the day here. to compare with the price and everything that they have here I can say that it's worth the price. all the bird are amazing and look heathy.
,,Well organised !,4.0,,"We had a great time there, my 9 years old daughter enjoyed lot! Unfortunately she lost her glass though:)"
,,Exellent shows,5.0,,"2 bird shows, Kings of the Skies and High Flyers Show, gave us quite marvelous experience in different aspect. It's highly recommended to attended."
,,Fun Day Activity,5.0,,Its fun for kids to see all the birds - theres a wet area too which kids can enjoy - the tram is a good choice to take since there a lot to walk otherwise.
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"when we bought combo ticket for zoo & Bird park we thought the location of both will be adjacent but unfortunately it is located quite far away from zoo.

As we all know Singapore is hot & humid hence we should always go for Tram ride during the Bird Park visit.

Bird park is full of colourful birds & is divided into zones. The Tram will drop you at location you explore that then take Tram again drop you to next zone. You will change Tram frequently & use whatever is available."
,,Not as good as it used to be,3.0,,"Having visited the Park 10 years ago, I was disappointed with my recent visit. The landscaping is fantastic but the birdlife numbers were very much down on the previous visit. The food at the cafes was disgusting and over-priced"
,,Thoroughly enjoyed,5.0,,"Had a lovely morning in the Bird Park. We enjoyed the Penguins and the Waterfall Aviary (much like everyone else!). Really nice to walk around - we bought the tram ticket and used it twice interspersed with walking.

For visitors - note, we had only been in Singapore for 36 hours and it was really warm & humid which probably meant we left earlier than we did - its a long way from the centre of the city. Excellent MRT/Bus Interchange at Boon Lay."
,,Accidental Personal Guide!,4.0,,"I love birds & am glad I got to visit this park before it is moved closer to the zoo. I arrived & went into the first aviary where I was admiring the birds when I heard a young man talking to the birds. Turns out he is a regular at the park & known by most of the staff there. He provided me with a personal tour of the park for the day! Lucas wants to be a zoologist & I believe he will make a fabulous one! The park houses so many birds that I don't see in my part of the world. Clean & nicely set in the landscape, this is one of the better bird parks I have been to."
,,Colourful Birds Aplenty - Great Day at Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"We started off early to be there at opening time 8.30am. MRT to Boon Lay then a bus from the Terminal to Jurong - this is well sign posted from the MRT. Although we had purchased tickets at Changi the ticket voucher still needed to be changed at the ticket office. We took the tram around the Park to give us an overview of the park as we had partially planned the day to include both the Bird of Prey and High Flyers Shows. We started at the Lory Loft the large free flying aviary - this was fabulous with lots of colourful birds flying and walking around the aviary. We were there at feeding time so were able to be very close to the birds, they flew onto our hand too. We saw lots of birds we hadn't seen before, it was great to learn that Jurong also does conservation work for endangered species like the Hyacinth Macaw - a beautiful bright blue Macaw. As we walked around the Park we stopped by the Keepers who gave talks about the birds under their care. Times are well signposted for these talks. The Hornbill and Toucans are fascinating birds !!

The two bird shows were excellent particular the Birds of Prey which featured Eagles,Hawks and Vultures.

The Waterfall Aviary is beautiful with lots of birds wandering and flying about. The Waterfall walk takes you both below and above the waterfall - great place for photos.

You will need a minimum of 4 hours ( includes Shows ) to have a good look at what is at the Park."
,,Beautiful place for Bird lover,5.0,,Nice place to visit..i visited there first time even though it was memorable. Best place for bird lover.. Must visit in lifetime..
,,Awesome time with Birds!!,5.0,,"Its a perfect place to spend the day in Singapore. There a large variety of birds to see (variety of Horn Bills is especially impressive) and very informative especially for the kids. You get a taste of little bit of wilderness and its difficult to believe that you are smack in centre of a bustling city. There are shows all day round, its recommended that you pick and choose which one you want to see and plan accordingly. There is tram to roam around in the park. Tram is more like a fun ride rather than a means to move around in the park since the area of park is not too large to walk. Tram ride is recommended and our ticket that we got from Klook.com included the tram ride. Bird show at 'Pools Amphitheatre' is must see, plan your activity around this. We could also see 'Horn bill' show which was very informative and the lady giving the information was too good. Reserve at least 4-5 hours for this attraction but you can easily spend a day here if you have time. Facilities inside Park are very good including toilets, drinking water and also food."
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,"I have a bird phobia so it was with some trepidation that I accompanied my husband and bird mad 18 year old on a day trip to the Jurong Bird Park. I was won over - I held rainbow lorikeets, a macaw and I think I might be partially cured!

We choose to do the ""Lunch with the Birds optional extra where we had a lovely buffet lunch then a private bird show. To our surprise there were only 4 of us at the show. That meant my son got to be the volunteer for every activity - and interacted with all sorts of birds. It was a trip highlight for him.

Beware of the extremely high costs for photos with the birds. We paid anyway because who usually has the chance to hold a macaw?

The birds are amazing and the park does a lot in terms of conservation. Highly recommended. We went on a Monday and there were no queues."
,,Jurong Bird park,5.0,,There is no type of bird species which is not you will not find in the sanctuary. it is one of the best place of the city
,,Day with birds,5.0,,exotic birds are available in Jurong Bird Park. an experience to go ... the bird shows are brilliant and beautiful
,,An unparalleled bird extravaganza!,5.0,,"I had bought the pass for the 4 wildlife parks in Singapore, including the trams. I had not planned to see the bird park but since I bought the pass which included it - I planned a short visit. To my incredible surprise, it was my favourite of the parks! Incredible birds in a beautiful setting, the pinnacle being the waterfall enclosure which surprised me at how such a large area was still enclosed for the birds safety, but it felt like it was entirely in the wild! My only complaint was the bars that get in the way of some picture taking, some of the birds were in large enclosures but thick bars are in the way of the viewer. The age of the park is most likely part of the issue, but having some plexiglass or a lighter style bar would be nice for viewers. Especially regarding the Hornbills (so many types!)
It was rainy when I started my day... rather it was a downpour. So an umbrella plus a rain poncho were needed. There are not many spots to sit out a rain... but the birds were staying still and some were bathing in the rain, so it was good viewing regardless of the weather!
The tram was a great way to get my bearings as to how the park is laid out... I rode the full route as it was pouring rain and I was killing time, turned out that it was a wonderful preview. Do not try to get pictures from the tram as it goes too fast, but pay attention to the sights it points out as these are great to get pictures of while you walk the route.
Do not forget to bring money as it is 100% worth the few dollars to feed the Lory’s at the Lori Loft. These bright colourful birds are a crowd favourite and will land on you to get the nectar from cups you hold. Both young children and adults get joy out of this experience!
The enclosures where you can walk through and see the birds run and fly about are fabulous. The sounds and sights were memorizing. The nursery was wonderfully set up so you can see the process from eggs hatching to babies.
I ended up staying the entire day at this park, a definite have too amongst Singapore’s sights!"
,,Fascinating View,5.0,,"This place is definitely huge with a large assortment of birds and parakeets to view. A worthy place to go to if you are into nature, birds and photography as JBP has very much to offer for the peace and quiet-seeker who just wanted to escape the hustle and bustle of city life in Singapore. Price may be quite hefty but they do upkeep the place pretty well and is packed with bite-sized information and you can quite notice that the birds are well taken care of. Learnt a great deal of information from the park."
,,Colourful bird park,5.0,,This was our first point of visit among the four parks. we bought the parkhopper pass from here after giving the date for night safari at the time or buying this hopper pass . \we reached around 11 am and it was very hot and humid .picked a map and started seeing the sights . please plan your visit in such a way that the shows are also not missed. there are two show King of the skies and high flier show both are very good .Allow yourself minimum 5-6 hours to be spend in the bird park .\we finished at the parks closing time of 6pm.if you missed the lunch after you exit from park you can go to curry garden restaurant attached to the bird park where indian food is served . We found out that after the park closing hours taxis are scarce . so you can just walk to the main road and catch the bus to boonlay terminus . from there you can catch mrt to your acomodation .
,,A wonderful collection of exotic birds,5.0,,"Jurong bird park is one of the iconic tourist destinations of Singapore known for it's extensive collection of birds and especially Blue macaws. This place is quite big and you can spend around 3-4 hours of your time. Try not to miss the shows as they are very interesting and entertaining. Try to wear light clothes as you might have to walk a lot. Always stay dehydrated. The parrot collection is beautiful and the waterfall is a beautiful sight to watch. You can see peacocks roaming around. Overall, you must definitely visit this place as rare birds and such large collection is very hard to find in other parts of world."
,,Not prepared for bad weather,3.0,,"Hi Jurong Birdpark,

When we were there, the weather was bad, it rained heavily after we arrived when we were waiting for one of the bird shows, I think it was king of the skies or something to do with prey/eagles.

It rained heavily and we were not able to watch the show at all, but that is understandable. What's not acceptable is that everyone that was there for the show had to squeeze behind the small shelter behind the viewer seatings, waiting for the rain to end or to be less heavy so that we can make it to other shows.

The bird park should have some contingency for these scenarios so that visitors can still move back to the main entrance hall in the event umbrellas are not available instead of being stranded at one location.

My suggestion may not be suitable as the park is meant to be"
,,Fantastic for kids,5.0,,"Amazing for kids, specially if you can catch the special shows. Suggested to have the trum ride inside. Take your time to travel around as there is a lot to explore. Bird cages are amazing and kids will love it!"
,,Good weather plays an important part!,4.0,,"It was an awesome weather with not much sun, slight drizzle which lasted only few mins. Cooling.. on the signboards says on weekends there’s show at 130pm (can’t rmb exact time) at Birds of Asia, we were there but See no show..

Went to Lory Loft where we donated $3 to buy nectar water to feed the birds, staff on duty were very honest to let us know that it’s either there’s not many birds around or the birds were fully fed, but we still go ahead.. managed to feed a few birds. Water playground was very much enjoyable for th kids.. they enjoyed themselves very much. There’s a nice air-conditioned room with cushions for adults to rest while the kids play.. toilets were clean, just that there is no water heater for shower and the kids were shivering with lips turning purple.. (ceiling Fans were blowing directly over head)

The bad experience was at the photo booth, by digi photos, my friend was excited to see his photo on the screen and wanted to snap a photo. Instead of telling him not to do so, a rude staff on duty by the name of, Fatin, hit his hand away! Is that what a customer service crew at places of interest should behave? Yes, my friend may be in the wrong to try taking a photo, but she could have polite ask him not to do so, and if he did, ask him to delete the photo. She should not use physical action. My friend was nice enough to smile at her.. when I approached her to check out what had happened (my sis witnessed the scene and informed me), Fatin was rude and defended herself aggressively! Throwing her belongings into the cupboard unhappily, banging things here and there. I believe she called her superior who came shortly and approached me. He explained to me about her personal issue, apologised on behalf and gave us a card to access the photo online. Logan was professional in handling the situation.
Fatin is definitely not suitable for this line if she continues behaving like this. Before this incident, I saw that she was impatient with a group of Korean tourists too."
,,Family visit to Birdpark,2.0,,"Overall was good, except there is no local food in the park. Should have promote local food as it is a tourist attraction."
,,Awesome park,5.0,,"It was my 2nd time to go to Jurong Bird Park. This time around, the kids were with my wife and I. They had fun looking at the different birds and the shows. Tip: Bring your own water bottle (they have water dispensers around the park) and an umbrella or two (you don't want the rain to spoil your time around the park). Take the tram to cover more area faster (especially if you're with elderly people or very young kids). You can just hop off the hop on again to a different area."
,,Best bird park!,5.0,,"Need to spend a day fun filled, entertaining, with family and friends, cost effective? This is one among the few places in Singapore. Don't miss it, kids as well as adults would love the bird feeding session."
,,Enjoyed the place,4.0,,"Had a very enjoyable experience here, especially the 2 shows in which birds of prey and nocturnal birds were shown, were very engaging and attracted a huge applause from the audiences. The tram ride also helps you to get a glimpse of the entire park."
,,beautiful colorful,4.0,,yet another place in the small city state of Singapore which you must see if you have interest in birds to any small degree. It is a family type park but anyone can go and enjoy
,,AMAZING BIRD PARK,5.0,,"I have never seen so many different birds in the one place.... Beautiful Birds from all over the world. Even if you are not into Birds so much, this place is definately worth a visit."
,,Enjoyed every minute,5.0,,"One of the best places for bird lovers in Singapore. I spend about 8hrs.
Timings are 9am- 5:30-6pm, weekdays are the best if you don't want the crowd. Check out the bird shows are go half an hour prior the show to get good seats. Worth waiting extra to watch it.
There are trams inside which take you to different stops and you can get off at any stop look around and get back onto another tram.
Food and beverages available inside the premises at decent rates.
Kids will enjoy this place and so will adults and senior members.
Loads of birds are seen, and you can feed parrots too, thoroughly enjoyed every minute.

Bird shows - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Experience - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Maintenance - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Food Price - $$$ (Medium priced)"
,,Unforgettable,5.0,,Second largest Aviary in the World. Unlimited variety of Birds from around the Globe can be found here. Several shows are held daily with well trained birds. Quality of training is simply unbelievable. Birds perform unimaginable feats. Desire to come back can't be controlled.
,,Waiting for 2020,3.0,,"It’s a bit disappointing compared to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari. The merit is that you can cover it in half a day. With the overhead train replaced by one which runs on the road, and minimal changes to the show - it cannot attract repeat customers. Unless you absolutely love birds"
,,If you have not seen Jurong you have seen nothing,5.0,,"Best place to go for bird lovers... the kind of birds specially Macau's you see here is exceptional. They birds are well kept inside large enclosures so that they dont feel suffocated and seemingly are happy... bets place for Kids to get the first lesson in bird varieties across the world...

dont miss the Flamingo's"
,,"Nice park, but toilets are not clean",4.0,,"The park has nice facilities and wide variety of birds (bird shows are awesome) , but the toilets are always very smelly and dirty. Also the food variety is very limited inside the park (hotdogs, pizza, soft drinks etc) and you have to go to the exit for a proper meal. We brought kids there in the morning 10am and in the middle of the visit we can’t find any nice food place."
,,Both the flyer high show and Kings of the Skies show are impressive!,5.0,,Both the flyer high show and Kings of the Skies show are impressive! These were the first time our family have ever seen in our life. Good work. Good trainers! Keep on the hard work. And protect the birds. Thank you.
,,Jurong Bird Park,3.0,,"Overall just Ok. Not convenience if without own transport, very hard to get cab or even grab from there to go home."
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"It was great time spend at bird park, the bird show & overall arrangements were very good. One improvement area one of the soft drink dispensing machine near the tram station & parrot area was accepting money but not dispensing, no response on given contact number also, all machines should be checked on regular basis"
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,Great shows included in entry fee. Would have been good to have the tram ride included as there is quite a lot of walking in the humid heat. Awesome birdlife.
,,Rare and wonderful birds,5.0,,"I visited this place with my adult daughter and 8 year old granddaughter. We could have stayed much longer than 6 hours, but we were limited by the little one's energy level. We enjoyed the penguin feeding and the birds of flight show, highlighting the macaws, toucan, pelicans, flamingos etc.
The Lory Loft was our highlight where we could purchase a liquid feed and feed the colourful lorikeets, which often landed on our outstretched arms without fear!
Personally I enjoyed the flamboyant flamingos with their long skinny legs.

They also had a water theme park area where little ones could cool down and regain energy and enthusiasm to continue with the park. A definite place to stop and cool down if travelling with kids.

A must for anyone who loves birds.
Don't forget your water bottle
Bring swimming gear"
,,Spoiled By The Rain,2.0,,"Spoiled by the Rain... Could not enjoy as per expected.Tram service refused to take wheelchair due to rain. Could not really bring around old parents as per wished. Food is a way too expensive.
The show is ok though. Again could not catch all the shows due to heavy rain which limited our mobility with my old parents and young kids. The bad weather to blamed and not the Park Authority entirely...!"
,,Good Place for bring my Children here..,5.0,,"I have visited Jurong Bird Park many times, still very good to bring my son and Daughter here..They like the Bird park.."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Very nice place, easy to move around extremely children friendly. Staff extremely cordial. Lots of option for F&B. Will visit another time"
,,Lovely place,5.0,,This is one of the best place to visit lovely birds. One can witness colorful birds. Feeding the parakeet is the best experience if one visits this place.
,,A MUST for bird lovers!,5.0,,"My visit to the Jurong Bird Park of Singapore was one of the top highlights of my trip. The park has a wide collection of bird species from around the world and many shows throughout the day that highlight some of the birds. There is a tram, for a small extra fee, which makes loops around the somewhat large park, which is helpful. The most impressive area of the park to me was the waterfall aviary, which is the second-largest walk-in aviary in the world. The ""lory loft"" is a popular area, which allows an interaction with many lorikeets through feeding (small cups of sugar water can be purchased). The Jurong bird park is delightful and absoloutely one of the best aviary experiences I've ever had. I only had 4 hours in the park and wished I had longer, but I LOVE birds. Other people may be fine with less time. Such a special place!!"
,,"Jurong Bird Park is an aviary and tourist attraction in Jurong, Singapore.",3.0,,"African Waterfall Aviary
The African Waterfall Aviary is the second largest walk-in aviary in the world, covering 2 hectares (4.9 acres) and including more than 600 free-flying birds of more than 50 species. The aviary is named after the 30-metre (98 ft) tall Jurong Falls, one of the world's tallest man-made waterfalls. Species include the golden-breasted starling, turacos and the hoopoe.
Dinosaur Descendants

In one corner of the zoo there is a section full of flightless birds: ostriches, emus, rheas and cassowaries are the residents of this exhibit.
Wings of Asia

Visitors can see the largest collection of Southeast Asian birds, which has over 200 species. There are large, central walk-in aviaries and peripheral aviaries housing the more delicate and territorial birds. A thunderstorm is simulated at noon each day, followed by a cool, light drizzle. Territorial species are kept in large cages, while species that can coexist with each other (fruit doves and pigeons being two examples) are left to roam freely in the aviary.
Lory Loft
The Lory Loft

About nine storeys high and covering 3,000 square metres (32,000 sq ft), the Lory Loft is the world's largest walk-in flight aviary for lories and lorikeets, with over 1,000 free-flying lories. The ambience is similar to that of a rainforest valley in tropical Northern Australia. Visitors can offer the lories a special nectar mix.
Penguin Coast
Penguins

Houses five species of penguins within 1,600 square metres (17,000 sq ft). Featuring a 21-metre (69 ft) tall Portuguese galleon façade and designed to resemble a ship, the interior of Penguin Coast is constructed with timber beams and wooden flooring. Penguin Coast is home to the Humboldt, rockhopper, macaroni and king penguins, which live in an indoor, climate-controlled den with access to an outdoor enclosure showcasing African penguins, one of the few species that are adapted to the tropics. Joining them are cape shelducks and gulls.
World of Darkness

Asia's first nocturnal bird house features a system of reverse lighting, converting day to night and vice versa. On display are 60 birds from 17 species, like the night herons, fish owls, boobook owls and snowy owls. It is akin to a quiet nocturnal walk along a starlit jungle path, watching birds in their nocturnal surroundings and hearing them beckon each other.
Pelican Cove

Visitors catch a glimpse of all seven species of pelicans, including the endangered Dalmatian pelican. There is a board-walk where visitors can stroll and observe the birds. Visitors can also see the pelicans at the world's first underwater viewing gallery for pelicans, where the birds scoop up fish at feeding time.
Shows
High Flyers Show
Salmon-crested cockatoo

This bird show has the world's largest number of performing birds in a single act. Besides highlighting the antics of talented birds like the mimicking cockatoos, this show is also a window onto the natural behaviour of birds like pelicans, flamingos and hornbills.
Kings of the Skies Show

Visitors watch birds of prey such as eagles, hawks and falcons, who will fly in loops and soar above the treetops. Visitors also learn about falconry as these birds are put through their paces in a simulated hunt.
Lunch with the Parrots"
,,Variety of birds and shows,5.0,,Birds are segregated into different zones. Saw many rare birds. Many shows were conducted. They were enjoyable. Kids enjoyed feeding lorikeets. There is a good Indian restaurant. There were huge queues for the tram as they were limited in number.
,,"Great Park, Will Be Better Once Moved to The Zoo",4.0,,"Not sure if they are letting this place go down the pan in regards to the structure. I know they are moving from here to the zoo are, so everything is under one roof but that is not till 2020. Don't get me wrong, it is a great day out, there is lots to see. I'm not a fan of the live shows, if you have seen the shows in USA then this is nothing compared to them, but nevertheless, it is worth seeing them. We did not initially take the tram, instead following the map seeing all that there was. The aviary is awesome, buy some food for the birdies and they'll come and sit and eat, it was very nice experience. Once we walked the park, we then took a trip round the park on the tram to see if we had missed anything.

There is a shuttle bus that goes to the zoo area but this is only on the hour, so we instead had to get a taxi.

Overall, a great day out with lots to see."
,,Another HIGHLIGHT--take the Metro & connecting bus right to the entrance!,5.0,,Birds galore and easy to get to even though it's outside downtown. Take the MRT to the stop where there is a connecting bus (2 stops past the Jarong MRT stop). Well done. Be sure to take lots of water as it can be hot and much walking is required. There is one refreshments area where the birds fly all around you and land on shoulders and heads. Great photos and fun for all. We only wish some of the cages were larger.
,,"Started slow, but great place to visit",5.0,,"I have to admit that walking into the park and finding tons of flamingoes didn’t bode well for my visit. But once I got past those, the rest of the park was great. The parrots and macaws, the waterfall aviary, the toucans and hornbills, the dinosaur descendants and the pelicans were all fantastic areas as were many smaller things in between. If you have any interest in birds - or maybe even if you don’t think you do - the bird park is well worth a visit."
,,Feels run down,2.0,,Whole place feels run down. Could not see much on the tram ride. Cages are rusty. Jurong Bird Park needs a big refurbish job to catch up with its peers like Singapore Zoo and River Safari.
,,Bird Park,5.0,,"Great attraction, many variety of bird , the tram will took you to 4 station , each station you can disembark and enjoy the attraction nearby"
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"The place was really nice and big and there were many exhibits to explore. I always loved to come here ever since I went as a small kid even though I don't live in Singapore. Many of the birds could be spotted, if you just try hard enough to look for them. Unfortunately a part of the birds of prey exhibit was under renovation when I visited with my friends and that was a bit of a shame. Nevertheless, there are still many cool birds to see. The Lory Loft was crowded and very few lories came to feed from our bird food cup so that was kind of a downer (granted we did come on Vesak Day). They were probably all well-fed already by the previous visitors; we came there around past noon. We had wanted to go to the Waterfall Aviary as well since that was like the main attraction for us but unfortunately again, it rained very hard and we couldn't enjoy that part of the trip. Me and my friend just went and ran into the rain anyways though hahaha. Could be nice for atmospheric rainy shots too near the waterfall which was a very nice scene even in the pouring rain. My tip for visiting here? Definitely go with friends and family, that always makes thing a whole lot more fun. Check the weather forecast first, sunny to cloudy days are the best and you should avoid rain when going here at all costs. The place is pretty big so we did do a hefty amount of walking but if you're used to that, the park will be no problem. If not, you can get a park train ticket for $4 or $5 per adult I'm not sure I forgot. The layout of the place is very convenient as well, it's pretty much a big circle and you'll visit all exhibits by going one round around it which is neat. Food and beverage wise? Those weren't our top priority when visiting because we were too fixated on the awesome birds haha. There are water refill stations around the place and vending machines which is nice. Not a whole lot of food areas scattered around though, they're mostly situated near the entrance. But at least that keeps the park clean too! Check out their website as well it has many useful information! Overall a really nice experience in Jurong Bird Park with me and my friends."
,,Good bird park!,4.0,,"The shows are great,the lori loft and penguin feeding super.Unfortunately it decided to rain prettily heavily that day and even though there is enough shelter at various points.after 45 minutes we decided to terminate our visit and leave as the birds were all cold and wet themselves.A disposable raincoat is hardly much help,we didn't carry our umbrellas which is mandatory as the weather is erratic.The cafe at lori loft is a good place to wait and have cappucinos as you dry off some dampness from the rains."
,,entertaining point for kids,5.0,,This place offers a wide range of birds. the shows here are too much fun. kids will for sure enjoy a lot. the place is such peacefully built that inside various arenas you actually get the feeling of being in the forest inside bird's shelters.
,,Great Day Out,4.0,,We used the tram again at this venue and went to all the shows that are put on at various parts of the park. It is a very full day but so much to see and do and very interesting we are glad we didn't miss it.
,,Jurong Bird Park visit,5.0,,"What a lovely place, so clean and such beautiful birds, so colorful. Loved the Flamingos! Keep up the good work."
,,Very nice experience,5.0,,"The shows were entertaining and educational to children. Clean and good place for stroll. If stroll is not your thing, the tram ride is good too."
,,Recent holiday,4.0,,"Had my 70 year old Dad with me and a lover of birds and always high on his bucket list’
It didn’t disapoint’ Interactive live show was fantastic and the species and type of birds in the park were amazing’
Did get stung by the merchandise photograph, where you get to hold some birds on a stick’
$80 for two photos I found very steep and insane’ prices weren’t advertised anywhere’

Had a good day was very clean and ammneities fantastic’

Going to be fantastic when all the zoos and bird park are all situated in the one place"
,,World Class Standard- Jurong Bird Park (Singapore,5.0,,"As a proud Singaporean, Jurong Bird Park is another world class standard tourist site that is home to thousands of feathered species- bird kingdom.
Besides clean, interactive and well fed/ maintained birds, service, food and other attractions have exceeded expectations. Lori Loft, Wild Birds encounters, Parrot Paradise are the top three must visit areas. Well done, Wildlife Reserve Singapore and Jurong Bird Park Team for your excellent effort!!"
,,Bird lovers Paradise,5.0,,"This is truly a paradise for birds and bird lovers. The Singapore government is doing a lot to save endangered birds. They have a breeding and research centre where eggs and chicks are nurtured. You can see a wide range of colourful birds, including the rare blue macaw here.
The Waterfall Aviary with a 30 metre high waterfall is a refreshing sight. This is supposedly the world's largest walk-in aviary with over 600 free-flying birds.
You can take a tram ride but it's best to explore the place on foot because the trams don't cover the interior regions."
,,Colorful Bird Park!,5.0,,"We visited Jurong Bird Park in May 2018.

Its a beautiful park, vibrant with colorful birds.

We started with the Penguin Coast. Housed in a ship-shaped building, you can find four species of penguins suitably cooled in the air-conditioned Penguin Coast exhibit – the Humboldt, the Macaroni, the King Penguin and the “spikey-haired” Rockhopper. Beside them, a a flock of contented-looking puffins nest on “rocky cliffs”.

There are a couple of shows one can watch, We enjoyed the High Flyer Show, it was an interactive show of around 30 minutes. High Flyers Show features Jurong Bird Park’s birdy stars. From hornbills to parrots, and pelicans to flamingos, the High Flyers Show entertains visitors with brightly-coloured and charming feathered talents. Look out for “personalities” like Sassy the Cockatoo and Amigo the Yellow-naped Amazon Parrot.

We included a Tram ride, as it was convenient to tour the entire place.

Our son enjoyed the Birdz of Play - A must-stop spot for the kids. Take a break from the birds and have some fun at this colorful playground. The wet play area has a shallow pool for kids to cool off in, and a play structure complete with a tipping bucket dunking gallons of water to those beneath it.

Overall, a must visit place."
,,Beautiful & very colourful,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park, for me is very nice.There are a couple of shows one can watch, We enjoyed the High Flyer Show, it was an interactive show of around 30 minutes.
There are many flamingos in Flamingo Lake. There is a beautiful aviary called Waterfall Aviary. There are several observation points in the aviary that give different views of the waterfall.
one can spent several enjoyable hours in the park, It is absolutely beautiful. There is a lot to see and do there. We enjoyed the park very much."
,,Recommended!,4.0,,"We went there with a 4-parks combo ticket and we enjoyed it a lot!
We took the Metro Green Line to Boon Lay and then at bus interchange we took n.194 bus which brought us to Jurong Bird Park in 10 minutes.
We decided to go around on foot (tram is included in the ticket but you still have to get out to see the birds and then there is a long queue to catch it again): first we saw the night birds, then several kingfishers, the lorry loft (a huge aviary with many parrots and also a rope bridge), the area of hornbills and toucans, other parrots, the discovery center (which explains eggs and nests), ostriches and emus, casuari, other large parrots, pelicans, flamingos. We also see 3 beautiful iguanas.
Overall we liked it a lot, even though it was very hot because it was humid."
,,Awesome Bird Park,5.0,,"Visited on a Sunday morning..it is in one corner of Singapore but well connected by MRT, Bus n Cabs..it is better to buy entry tickets online as it is cheaper..so many varieties of Birds,Ducks,Parrots,Pelicans, Penguins..of all sizes n colours..you can buy feeds & give it to the birds..plenty of greenery, water & trees...aviaries are fairly big..However, I felt parrot cages are small..also took a paid tram ride inside the Park.. plenty of walking to do..hence wear your Keds, hat & carry water...there is a 100feet high waterfall... bathing is not permitted...A must see tourist spot in Singapore."
,,don't miss ice Penguin,3.0,,"Can visit once. Bring your camera too because in the shows we will take only video. Don’t miss the bird show it will be conducted at 11am and 3pm. Hawk arena show at 10am and 4pm. After birds show we can take photos with flamingo. We can pass our camera to the people and they will take photo. Opening time will be 8:30am to 6pm. You can get ticket in very cheap rate with some vendors. Don’t miss ice penguin section it will swim very nicely, Parrot paradise and wet land (but bit smelly)."
,,Bird heaven,5.0,,I love birds and there are some amazing ones in this park and I visit each time I go to Singapore. It's a vast area but there is a little run around buggy-train that drives around the park to get you to some of the further spots without needing to walk. Make sure you see the shows - the birds are great and the staff clearly care a lot about them.
,,Paradise indeed,5.0,,The park shows and birds are well maintained and kids can enjoy the vibrant colors of the birds. You can now convert your one day ticket to annual subscription membership which will allow unlimited access during weekdays. Go get it now!
,,"Well maintained, bird shows were fabulous",4.0,,"Courteous staff, awesome shows and colourful birds made our day. Kids get to feed the birds and thoroughly enjoyed that. Keep up the good work."
,,close up with birds,5.0,,"Get close view of the birds... try your photography skills here... kids play area, breeding center and lory loft are my recommendation...and amphitheater.."
,,Jurong bird experience,3.0,,The temperature is hot so be sure to bring cold water and some wide brimmed hat. Remarkable varieities of birds and lovely novelty shops.
,,A visit to remember,5.0,,The amphitheater show is the main attraction here. The birds on this show are unbelievably trained and it is one of very few exotic animal shows left in the world
,,Amazing bird show that will give you goose bumbs,4.0,,"Went to Singapore for a holiday and going to bird park was on our list.... Since day 1 of reaching Singapore, my lil one wanted to visit this place...

Finally on 3rd day of our trip we went to Jurong bird park.... Took a cab to reach this place as it was the most convenient option... No direct metro service was available and we had to shift from metro to a bus after reaching a point... Didn't want to do any sort of adventure so took a cab...

Reached this place around 2pm.... I would recommend people to visit much earlier... As soon as you enter there are people who will take a family snap with birds on your hand... Sounded like fun so went for it. It was a rip off... One picture they charge 30SHD... Also they will block your view so that nobody can click with their personal camera.

There are 2 ways of visiting this place... One you can walk around or take a bus trip. We took the bus trip which lasted for 20mins and didn't get to see any birds properly... Visiting this place by feet is the best option....

Now coming back to the bird park... You will get to see some amazing birds that you would have never heard of... They have maintained the place so well. The best part of Jurong is their bird shows... It happens every alternate hour. So plan your visit in such a way that you will cover most bird shows... It's incredible to see how well the birds are trained and how the performers keep the audience glued to their seats... The best thing to do in Jurong is to watch the bird shows... Adults and kids both will have super time"
,,Wow simply wow,5.0,,As you enter you get to see penguin which I dream of and wanted my kids to see the beautiful birds different kinds of parrot and Honolulu birds the show of vultures owl eagles was awesome they fly above your head and another show of birds parrot and Honolulu was and awesome experience must visit but take 3 hours time to do so
,,EXPERIENCE,4.0,,"What a nice day that was for my child he enjoyed a lot especially in the bird show and penguin feeding the bird safari was a little fast so we can""t enjoyed it otherwise all things are good."
,,High Flyers and Waterfalls,3.0,,"May be because it was a rainy day or may be not, we did not find most attractions compelling. Best was of course the famed high flyers and the beautiful waterfalls trails. The staff seem very committed which was great."
,,Very average and pricey for standard entry...,3.0,,Do yourself a favour and combine this with a visit to the Zoo or Safari on the same day as the Bird Park is quite small and can easily be completed in 2-3 hours. We had a little stroll around the park and saw the 3 PM show before departing. Didn't spend that long here and there's not that much to see in comparison to the zoo.
,,Review on Juron bird park,4.0,,A must visit place during Singapore trip. we will get a chance to feed the birds and they organize birds shows as well
,,Lovely,5.0,,"This is my second visit to the Jurong Bird Park and it did not disappoint. Although we got caught in a thunderstorm, I am so glad that I got to visit this park again. Lovely collection of birds from around the world. It is well presented, clean and it's obvious that the birds are well cared for."
,,Feeding the Flamingos,4.0,,"It was my girlfriends birthday on the Sunday we visited and one of her passions are flamingos.We had a lovely walk around the park.I asked one of the staff about the possibility of my friend feeding the flamingos and told him why(they can be fed by the public on weekends and public holidays).He was very kind,and organised it for her.Sadly they are so well fed,only a couple reacted to her,but she was pleased with the experience.Went to one of the shows,which was well done.The birds seem to have as much fun as the audience.Well worth the time"
,,Good Collection Of Birds,4.0,,We reached at 10.00 PM we could complete the tour in 3 hrs. We watched the bird show at their Amphitheater. The ambience is good & the layout of the garden is well planned
,,Jurong Visit,5.0,,"good place to be with family and kids. all flora and fauna under single place across the globe. more educative not only to children, but to all. a must itinerary in your Singapore package"
,,Nice place,4.0,,We visited this place and found it better than expected. Park was neat and enjoyed spending 3 hours here with family.
,,Simply Amazing,5.0,,"Visited the Park with a group of families. It is a marvel to see so many birds in a eco friendly park. You get to see a varied variety of birds ranging from Flamingos, Hornbills, Penguins, Lory Loft, doves, pigeons etc.
The best way to visit the park would be to take the tram to Tram Station 3 or 4 and then walk down to admire how the different types of birds gel into the beauty of nature. Please note that the park organizes a bird show as fixed time, which is a must see and you must plan your travel as per the timings of the bird show."
,,Colors of the World at the Birds park,5.0,,"A pleasant experience by my family and the little 7 month old tiny tot who had fun at the birds park.
The lorry loft was a good experience. Where you have birds trying to perch on our shoulder. And specially never should w miss the shows organised by the park."
,,good for nature lovers,4.0,,"pls try to go at 9.30AM -10AM .You will see penguin feeding /bird show which is their highlight .place is big and trams are there to move around ,i liked to sit it in the tram and take a round of full jurong bird park.you should have full stamina to walk around in the heat . get down at waterfall station and see the same ."
,,Jurong bird Park,5.0,,A very large collection and display of birds .Actually Birds of all feathers..so to say. A colourful place to spend some time knowing about bird facts.Rare blue macaws were the highlight. Recommended.
,,Nothing Wrong at Jurong,5.0,,"We visited on a rainy day
The crowd was above average
The team ride explained the whole park
We had time scarcity so we did not get down
We saw a large no of birds playing
Excellent fountains as well as groups of pink Flamingos also
We ended up with the Bird Show in the Amphitheatre
This was by Jove a great show to watch"
,,if you must go to yet another zoo....,3.0,,"Nice.....well, if your children are desperate to see birds and you feel like spending another few hundreds of dollars and a day in a crowded busy hot park....then go. The smell of birds is a bit annoying. The heat here a bit hotter than anywhere else. Very crowded with mostly Asian tourists (yet another annoying aspect). Sort of fun for kids. If you have to choose - then go to the ZOO and Night Safari instead!!!"
,,One of the best parks,5.0,,"Some of the areas you should not miss in this park, the man made water fall, tallest in the world, as claimed by park authority, Penguin feeding, and live shows"
,,Natural Tropical Geaway,4.0,,I spent two hours at the bird park on a hot Sunday afternoon and was amazed at the diversity of wildlife. For a few extra dollars you can ride the tram about a 30 minute excursion through the park which let you see the highlights follow that with a walk to see more of the hidden gems here. This is a great family destination there is a lot to do free old and young alike and most of the park is accessible.
,,Amazing day-out with colorful birds,4.0,,"We spent more than half a day here. Quite a huge place. Birds are well-taken care of by professionals. So big we couldn't cover all the species. Penguins right at the beginning was a good start. Had interesting show with Pelican chit chat show, very informative. Good place for some children. We took the tram, which is worth it."
,,Colourful Birds n wonderful park,5.0,,"Had wonderful time with family, my kid loved it absolutely, it was raining when we went so we took rain coats from the counter and walked in the rains, had so much fun seeing closely different species birds, must visit for family with kids."
,,Colorful Birds,5.0,,"Had a wonderful & pleasant day at the Jurong park....
Colorful birds, courteous staff, excellent shows for all group age, nice food, free tram service within the bird park (Queue is long).
It's all day activity, you won't get bored when you visit bird park. I haven't seen so many different kinds of birds anywhere in the world. Excellent shows, great display, beautiful & coloful birds!
Try to visit early morning as there are many shows which are held during the start of the day, and it's less crowded.

Had fun & a memorable day. A must visit for everyone coming to Singapore. I ended up all day (7hrs approx) when my initial plan was just 2 hrs. Singapore tourism at it's best."
,,Singing with the Birds,4.0,,"Such a well laid out venue, unfortunately some displays were closed for renovation. The park is being relocated next to the zoo so that will be amazing. The bird show was entertaining and crowd participation was good"
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,"It was a great experience, kids had a good time and enjoyed very much. Missed the shows due to time constraints."
,,interesting and informative,4.0,,"We certainly saw a lot of birds, colorful and beautiful. It was nice to have a chance to really see the local birds up close, and think about how they differ from their cousins in other parts of the world. We also saw a lot of local vegetation, which was a nice opportunity as so much of Singapore is developed and paved. I share the mixed feelings that many people have about animals in captivity, on display. To my untrained eye, this seemed humane and the habitat seemed pretty authentic. It had a similar vibe to the San Diego Zoo. The infrastructure for human visitors was nicely maintained, and the personnel were friendly."
,,Where life added some much needed colour,5.0,,"Had an excellent day yesterday with family at the Bird Park with Singapore tourism at its best. Interacted with many people at the Park through the day and all, very cordially held out a helping hand when called upon. To call out a few – the lady bus driver on bus 194 that got us there (sorry, didn’t catch her name) was cheerfully helpful, Vincent at the Pizza Hut counter was efficient and served a butter-dripping warm garlic bread and a wicked cup of coffee (perfect accompaniment as the weather was a bit damp in the morning, but cleared later), and Logan at the photo counter was professional as well as charming with all members of my family (he got my six year old son to stand still, pose with birds in hand and smile – all at the same time – for the camera!).

Thanks all for an enjoyably memorable day."
,,TRAM LINE,4.0,,Tram queue line is too long. It rained so we were really not able to go around. The shows are great! specially the singing bird!
,,Fantastic a must do,5.0,,"Expected to spend 2 hours here ...ended up staying 7 hours. So much to see. Incredible shows, beautiful displays. GREAT day out"
,,Day well spent with the Feathered Friends,4.0,,Great way to escape urban life to relax with nature.A total of 5000 birds from 380 species. All of them in beautiful colors and sounds. Its a huge place so be ready to walk or you can also use the tram which have various stations and give info about some of the exhibits while you pass them.The also have shows for you to enjoy. Overall money spent well
,,Amazing species of Birds,4.0,,Good place for Families and specially for Kids. They also conduct birds shows at different intervals. Should be included in your trip itinerary.
,,Amazing Birds & their Amazing Shows !!,4.0,,"Wonderful place for kids and also for bird lovers. Amazing collection of wonderful birds. The most amazing things are the bird shows, one should not miss the shows while roaming to the park."
,,Wonderful experience with fascinating birds.,4.0,,"Enjoyed the bird shows thoroughly and these should be a must for every visitor. Unfortunately, during our visit it started raining heavily and there was considerable delay in tram car ride due to poor visibility. We couldn’t get out of the tram car and had to miss viewing some of the birds. The efforts put in by Jurong Bird Park staff members to maximise our viewing pleasure even under the adverse weather conditions are quite commendable."
,,Best place to see birds,5.0,,"One of the best collections of birds in Singapore for many years. It will not fail to amaze anyone who loves birds. Rare birds like birds of paradise, eagles and vultures abound. The enclosed aviary have free flying birds while you walk amongst them. It's an experience not to be missed unless you are afraid of birds after watching Alfred Hitchkok 's movie."
,,Really enjoyed,5.0,,"My uncle and aunt came from Toronto, Canada. I brought them to Jurong bird park. We really enjoyed the visit. Especially on the bird show, we could participate as a show member. Thanks for the memories!!"
,,Bird and more,5.0,,You can photo with many birds. Instagramable place. Many variants and colorful birds. There are rare birds also
,,Nice park,4.0,,Nice park with lots of birds species. I particularly liked the parrots section. Go in the morning as it gets very hot in the afternoon
,,Back to the bird park,4.0,,Another visit to the bird park yesterday before our annual 4 park membership expires. Seems to be quite a few areas under repair at the moment though. The owls seem to have disappeared. And the birds of prey are undergoing a major renovation. Otherwise good to be back.
,,Birdy Num Num,5.0,,I wanted to visit this place more than my son. When you visit this place you realise that how fascinating the world of birds are . We did parrot feeding that was quite interesting. Also we saw some shows that gave us glimpse of how birds react.
,,boring place,2.0,,"avoid if you can. no more sky train, road tram is not good lots of waiting and lots to walk. and shows also not that great"
,,"Most friendly staff in singapore, excellent collection of birds",5.0,,"you may be reading my reviews about other places of singapore in this forum. let me tell you something. of all the tourist places i visited in singapore, this is the only place where the stafff were warmth and not having any scowlon their face and were addressing the tourists' questions patiently. everywhere else the people were very rude and were using harsh words. the birds collection here is stupendous. i liked the penguin section and the flamingos really. the man-made waterfalls is an excellent photo-shoot place. the bird-show is worth watching once."
,,Jurong Bird Park - Must go to Place,5.0,,Jurong bird park is a must visit place when anyone plan for a trip to Singapore. You can see different variety of birds and that too in huge numbers. People visiting this place need to check the show timings ahead so that they don't miss it. The show was lovely and everyone irrespective of age will enjoy watching it!!
,,Amazing place a must visit for kids,5.0,,This is an amazing place for kids a lot to learn. Well maintained and extremely friendly staff. A must visit location in Singapore
,,Very Depressing,1.0,,"Not what I expected, I felt so sorry for the birds in the small cages, they should be allowed to fly around not just hop from branch to branch especially the larger birds. Most of the birds seemed to be struggling to breath with the humidity and couldn't see any water for them, I love animals and I left feeling very depressed as I couldn't help them. If you want to display these birds please let them fly more freely in a lot larger enclosures. Also the the water birds were in very dirty water"
,,Good,4.0,,Tram ride appears to be a short one. The birds show and collection of birds are definitely worth watching.
,,Some of the best bird views,5.0,,"Really enjoyed the visit to Jurong Bird Park, it was absolutely brilliant..... The baby loved it specially the shows and the up close experience with the birds, it was indeed a memorable one...."
,,Birdy day,4.0,,"Jurong is a must visit for families with kids
Best way to reach is MRT with bus service,takes time but saves money
They have pool amphitheatre show and kings of the sky show at 10 am and then 3 pm ,make sure you reach for the morning show so you can leave jurong by 3 pm and try and do river and night safari the same day
They have an amazing collection of birds ,pelicans ,flamingos ,herons ,macaws, parrots ,toucans ,pigeons ,owls ,hornbills ,peacocks,penguins ..
Make sure you cover the whole park
Enjoy the bird feeding ,it's quite unique
The shows are fun,especially the pool amphitheatre with macaws, hornbills, the birds do some amazing tricks
The kings of the sky show pales in comparison to the 1st
Jurong can be covered in 4 hours ,so begin early
Avoid the curries garden restaurant, which most Indians are tempted to try,the south Indian food is really flat in taste ,dosas ,Vegas are really average
Enjoy a birdy day ..."
,,A great day out,5.0,,Another beautiful place to visit in Singapore. We caught the train to this area and then a short bus ride to the Bird Park. The park itself is quite extensive with a huge array of birds. It was worth the visit.
,,Great shows and a lot of birds - hire a electric wheelchair,4.0,,"A great place to visit which takes between 2 to 3 hours to see properly. Many magnificent and varying types of birds with good interaction with visitors. Get there early as can get crowded later in the day - opens at 8.30am which would be a good time to arrive. Cost is Sg$30 + $5 for the train. As a lot of walking is involved, I would recommend hiring an electric wheelchair for $20. Taxis turn up often for departing also a van service (10 seater) is available outside near taxi rank for $50 anywhere in Singapore - good value for families and no wait for a taxi. A 10% discount is available on presentation of your Singapore/Silk Air boarding pass."
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"One of the best bird park I have visited. Friendly staff, very well maintained enclosures, clean and hygenic bird enclosures, clear and precise signages and good bird shows"
,,Bird Paradise,4.0,,"This park filled with many kinds of birds from cockatoo, flamingo, pelican, and the cutest pinguin!
I prefered to ride tram to go around the park and stop at some stations inside the park. It allowed me to see which points I would like to look furter at (since the area's quite huge).
I suggest you to go there in the morning."
,,Great day out,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park was recommended to us by a friend and although our visit was interrupted by a huge storm, we still managed to make it around the whole park. The setting is beautiful and it's easy to get around on foot or on the shuttle. We only caught the end of one show and didn't see any others because of the weather, but what we saw was great. Unfortunately, we also missed out on the kids' water play, but that would have been great on a dry day. I highly recommend visiting the bird park for a unique day out."
,,Excellent Destination,5.0,,"Excellent family destination. Very well organised. Make sure that you do not miss the shows, specially the High flyers show."
,,Our Visit to Jurang Bird Park Singapore,5.0,,Its awesome experience. Well planned shows and activities. Very clean and informative. Very good for teens and adults. Must to visit !!!
,,One of the Best Bird Park,5.0,,"This is one of the best bird park i have seen.... Park is awesome, very clean. the bird show is excellent one should not miss this one."
,,So crowded,3.0,,It takes nearly an hour to wait in the station 1. The park should provide more trams in the peak hour.
,,Nice,5.0,,"Very good shows, lots of variety, 100 ft waterfall, excellent and entertaining staff, Lots of drinking water points"
,,Just Awesome!!,5.0,,"In fact, we visited it again to enjoy the 3pm & 4pm bird shows which is a must watch. Everything is kept so clean & neat."
,,enjoyable and some beautiful birds to see,5.0,,try and get in earlier in the day to avoid the heat when the birds are more active and as well as that you can see the feeding - either morning or late afternoon but the humidity builds up during the day.....
,,Not wheelchair friendly,2.0,,I went with my family and some close friends. We were all greatly surprised by the lack of wheelchair accessibility. I am assuming that the new location once the Bird Park is moved will be much better in this regard.
,,Disappointed,2.0,,"I love birds and really went out of my way to go here. What a letdown. The only exhibits worth seeing are the waterfall pavillion and the lorry loft because birds have somewhat of a natural environment to fly around and be free. The larger birds like hawks, hornbills, parrot exhibits almost made me cry. It was horrendous. Miserable birds in small pens. No toys or stimulation or anything to engage with. Such smart intelligent birds kept that way really put me off this place. Parrots and Macaws like to live in the treetops not so low down. Everywhere you looked there were birds hanging off the tops of cages as if to want to escape. The whole Disneyland train thing was a bit much even though it helped with the heat the prerecorded messages were smarmy. Too many loud noisy tourists allowed in the park at once. Can you go anywhere in Asia withour animals/birds being treated like a freakshow? They are razing their nature to the ground to build up their cities thus destroying the natural world so they can put their wildlife in cages. It's super depressing. Was really expecting more natural conditions for them. Less stupid man made pretend tree light shows and more money to preserve your real treasures - nature and wildlife please."
,,good fun,5.0,,bird show was clever - good place for families. interesting to see some more unusual tropical birds.
,,Lovely and well-designed Bird Park,5.0,,"A lovely day was had. The park is very well designed, with great themed areas such as the waterfall. Will return!"
,,Gorgeous park,5.0,,The bird park is gorgeous ! Definitely worth a visit . We loved the flamingos . Easy to get to by train .
,,Amazing place to have a family trip.,5.0,,Singapore is a very nice place to visit and enjoy with your family. It has tons of places for kids and family members to visit with.
,,Phenomenal collection of birds and good bird shows,5.0,,"Never ever seen so many birds at one place. The park is fantastically made with birds clustered as per the families / species they belong too. They have shows going on in the park which are not to be missed. We particularly liked the morning show in the amphitheater with birds performing various tricks.

Though taxis are there, the park is well connected with the MRT system, need to reach 'Boon Lay' station on the Green line and there a bus 194 from there that takes you directly to the JBP. They are planning to shift the bird park near to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari region in next 1-2 years i understood."
,,Must visit in Singapore,4.0,,"Wonderful Bird park. Takes 3 hours to see the place in its entirety. Check the timings of certain activities to make the most of your visit. The park encompasses a huge area and the variety / collection of species is great, but not as much as Bali Bird Park. Also, at Bali Bird Park, you can take pictures with the birds for free, but over here you need to pay to have a picture taken with the birds. However, the bird research lab at Jurong is really educational and gives good insight into the efforts put in by the team there. As per your liking, this park is suitable for families, friends or even solo persons. Kids will love it here."
,,It could be skipped during the Singapore visit,1.0,,"It is just a below average park with lot of hype created around it, very very far from city centre and extremely expensive for what it actually offers. Would not at all recommend to my family and friends."
,,Must see for bird lovers,5.0,,"It's a treat for nature lovers. The place is spread out but worth the walk. You can even take the tram. Very well maintained, clean and visitor freindly. A must see."
,,Edu-tainment at its best,5.0,,One of our best ways to spend a weekend. My 4 and 7 yrs old loves the lory loft where they get to feed the many colourful birds. I personally love the show at the Pool Amphitheatre where Lynn provides such great entertainment and insights into the bird keepers world.
,,Take a taxi,4.0,,"The park is some way from the centre. You can do the MRT / Bus option (according to other TA reviewers) but we chose taxi and had no regrets. About 30 minutes from Orchard road and not expensive at all. Finding a return cab from the Park also proved straightforward.
Entrance fees are reasonable - helped by a discount offered if you flew with Singapore Airlines. Don't waste your money on the bus unless you are physically unable to walk, it really is not too challenging to walk the park, even in the heat.
Park itself is excellent, lots to see and do. Feeding the parrots was the highlight for our kids, they really do come and sit on your arm for a shot of glucose."
,,Great place for kids,4.0,,"My son love birds so much and learn so much things but my whole family & relatives were not amazed of the creation how they build the entire place but atleast its a city with park whereby kids & adults gain some knowledge personally.
The place was neat & clean but the only thing we noticed was, a huge dome were u can find the FALLS interesting but it was too old and needed some updated architecture.
Staff are friendly, good attitude, but amenities are outdated.."
,,A day well spent,5.0,,"I never knew penguins can swim so fast till I visited Jurong! My daughter was thrilled to learn about the eggs, nests, beaks, bones of different birds in the Discovery Center. The army of flamingoes and pelicans were the highlight of the park. Please don’t miss the shows that happen at different times of the day. We had lunch with the parrots which was a great experience. You get to hold them, take pics and even take home one of the paintings done by a Macao named Pikasso"
,,Lovely park great Scenery,5.0,,This was our second visit to the Bird Park. They will be moving the Bird Park soon next to the other Wildlife Reserve parks so it will be more convenient. We had lunch with the parrots although the food was just ok the show was Fantastic my two boys 3 and 7 absolutely loved it. The park seems massive but can be easily seen on foot. The waterfall open Aviary is the most beautiful part of the park. The penguin exhibit is a big hit with the kids my kids spent almost an hour looking at the penguins we also saw there feeding session Indoor and feed them ourselves in the outside exhibit which the kids also loved. It’s a lovely place to walk around and look at amazing birds with a lot of convince very stroller friendly. If you have young children you will love the lazy strolling around the park with fun stuff for the kids to keep them busy.
,,Jurong,5.0,,Great place to visit especially with kids.Nice shows and informative trip.carry bottles of water cap and sunscreen if you plan to visit during Apr- may.
,,An afternoon well spent with the birds,4.0,,"Situated in Jurong Hill, the Jurong Bird Park is rather far away compared to the other animal parks in Mandai. We took the MRT to Boon Lay and then transfer by bus 194 which dropped us off right next to the bird park. We opted against having lunch with the birds at the park after reading quite a few disappointing reviews about others' experiences and arrived late in the afternoon not knowing what to expect. We had purchased the Park Hopper ticket and so had the tram rides free (for which we thanked our stars since it raining a bit). The park isn't too big and especially with the trams, it can be covered in about 2-3 hours. The park has a good variety of birds and kids would have surely have a great time there.

Our best memory at the park was the waterfall aviary. The sound of water crashing against the rocks along with birds chirping away in the background was incredible. It is also a great spot for photography. We spent quite a bit of our time here. Our biggest disappointment would have to be the canceled eagle show at the amphitheater due to rainfall. Alas, there's nothing one can do about that. Nonetheless, it was 3 hours well spent.

A note for those using public transport to commute from the park. The bus stop for Boon Lay is on the other side of the road and is not easily detectable. You'll have to cross the under bridge to get there."
,,Awesome day out at the bird park,4.0,,"The Jurong bird park is a long way from MRT stations, so would highly recommend a taxi (inexpensive) or a bus. The park itself is a wonderful display of the worlds birds. Very important underlying message of conservation too, which I liked."
,,DIFFERENT TO THE POSTER,3.0,,"We payed to have lunch with the Parrots, we expected more than what we got, the buffet lunch was cold, not tasty at all, the steal tables did not have tablecloths at advertised and the chairs were dirty, you only saw the parrots when they did the show and not brought to your tables as the photo showed, they did have a good display of birds in the park."
,,Overall good,4.0,,"This park is small and if you plan ahead can be covered in half a day. Shows can get cancelled, if the weather doesn't cooperate. It's good to buy a park hopper pass, if you intend to visit the zoo and night safari. Its good to buy the tram ticket."
,,Educational and relaxing family outing,4.0,,"My 2 sons and I enjoyed a very informative, yet relaxing outing to the park. I had never thought of going to the bird park, but a visiting friend went there and recommended I take my children, aged 10 and 12. I am glad that I did. We saw so many interesting birds and there was a lot of information, but it was not overwhelming. You can wander around the park or take a tram and get off at the different stops. There is a lot of shade to relax in and multiple places to stop and relax. The only reason that I have not given it a 5/5 is because I think the food choices could be improved on. I understand the bird park is to move nearer the zoo, which I think will be a great improvement and hopefully with the move will come associated healthier meal options. A highly recommended outing in Singapore."
,,Lot of fun,5.0,,"Loved the bird park. Enjoyed the shows. Be sure to visit the area where you can feed the birds, great fun"
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"This venue is too expensive. By the time we added our fares there from Orchard Road it cost my wife and myself $100.
It wasn't worth that. Take for instance the huge so called largest in the world wired over cage. There were only about ten birds in there. I expected clouds of birds flying everywhere.
Without the tram to go to each area, it wouldn't be possible to walk it. So entrance fee for two plus the tram was $70 alone.
I would have saved the money."
,,Spectacular Birds in lovely Surroundings,5.0,,We revisited Jurong after over ten years away. It was even better than we remembered. Our favourite activity was feeding the lorikeets but we also enjoyed the spectacular colourings of the birds around the park and in the walk-in aviary.
,,Excellent,5.0,,We enjoyed all through bird park. Birds are Kept very well and taken care of them. It’s just entrance fee is lil high.
,,Cut short by an afternoon thunderstorm,4.0,,"We traveled from the city on the EW line to Boon lay then transfered to bus No194 which took us directly to the park. On buying our tickets I showed our Singapore airline boarding passes & although we could not get a discount on our tickets the tram ride was free. We arrived at the park around 12.30 in the afternoon planning to tour the park then do the 15.00 &16.00 shows. Firstly we took the tram to Lory Loft to see the Toucans & hornbills. Next we took the tram to the waterfall Aviary. I fell in love with this place, so tranquil with the sound of water splashing & birds singing in the trees. We spent a lot of time here (more than an hour) so we had to miss the last stop to get back in time for the High flyers show at 15.00. As we sat down we could hear the thunder in the distance. The show started at 15.00, but within 5 minutes the heavens opened & there was a torrential downpour, every one ran for cover & I must give the park staff a round of applause for trying to carry on with the show from under the tent, but in the end they had to cancel the show for safety reasons. The noise of the rain on the Canopy was horrendous. Stopped at the Penguin exhibit as it was inside but the rain did not stop & so the kings of the skies show was also cancelled. Stopped for a bite to eat at the Hawk cafe on the way out hoping the rain would stop but it just kept on coming. Luckily the bus stop wasn't to far & we made a quick dash."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,Wonderful place and must to visit. I completely enjoyed the different types of birds and colors of birds. And the show was fabulous.
,,Nice place not very stroller friendly,4.0,,It's a lovely place to go with kids various types of birds.. the show times need to be more evenly balanced out so more people can enjoy it.. pls check with show times before going there as the whole place can be covered in 2 to3 hours.. not very stroller friendly so plan accordingly with kids.. nice time to go is usually reach by 2 pm in afternoon and spend time till 6 pm so u can c all the shows.. lot of food options including vegetarian options..
,,Nature at its best | 100s of Birds to see,5.0,,"One of the most beautiful things about Singaporeans is that they take immense care of their biodiversity. The Jurong Bird Park is full of marvellous birds and flying species and will leave you stunned. You can interact with these beautiful birds and learn more about their habitats, eating patterns, and even migratory patterns at various shows. You will also get a chance to feed the birds which is surely going to be a once in a lifetime experience! Start your day early because the Bird Park starts at 8.30 am and closes at 6.00 pm"
,,The Shows @ Jurong amaze you and the Park is Entertaining,4.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is conceived very well and it is like no other Bird Park in Asia. Very well maintained and is worth a visit with your family.

The shows that they have will truly blow your mind and is a fun activity to do while you are in the park. Dont miss the shows and plan your walk around the park accordingly.

You would need 3-5 hours in the park to really cover all the zones and see the shows along the route.

Food in the park isn't great and you must consider carrying some basic food. Particularly Vegetarians.

Elderly will find it difficult to walk and should opt for the electric carts. Call Jurong Bird Park before you book for senior citizens and ensure they are comfortable.

Hope this helps.

Cheers -
Aby Baldota"
,,Beautiful park with beautiful birds from all parts of the world,5.0,,"Had a great day at the park. Better still, the ticket counter staff helped us convert our day ticket to a free annual pass! Thank you! Highly recommended place to visit and we will definitely be back!"
,,Just ok,4.0,,"Just ok to visit, I would prefer JB ZOO instead cheap and better Find little costly. Teen kids will love it still."
,,Wonderful and Small,5.0,,Jurong Bird Park was a highlight of our 2 week holiday. Its not so big that you exhausted at the end of the day and the tram is great for tired legs. We spent a long time in the Lorry Loft feeding the lorikeets. ($3 for food) The kids were amazed that the birds would sit on your arm or shoulder. The splash park at the end of the day was great for the kids so pack bathers!!
,,Really good Bird Park,5.0,,"A stunning Bird Park - at least 5 times bigger than the one in KL - with lots of walk through aviaries, and excellent bird shows with clever parrots etc. We were here from about 10.00 am to 3.00 pm, as lots to see. I understand that in about 2020 it will move to next to the Zoo and be even bigger, but well worth getting a 30 minute taxi (about S$25) each way to this now."
,,As far as bird parks go - this is pretty good,4.0,,"I'm not overly big on birds, and even less excited about bird parks - seeing birds in cages tends to depress me. But this place is pretty great, especially the waterfall enclosure, which is over a hectare or more in size. The habitat inside is amazing. They park is doing a lot of captive breeding, to grow their collection for the new park in a few years. Its a good place to go to learn about all the endangered species and the threats on them."
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,Jurong Bird Park is a place where you can take your entire family and people of all ages will enjoy. Its recommended to reach this place im the morning as they have various bird shows which one must attend. The highlight of the place are the penguins and the Macaos. You can also feed the birds which is also a great experience.
,,A visit to Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,A great place to spend the whole day. A great collection of birds. The shows were well organised and it was a treat to see the rapport between the birds and their trainers.Theride inside the park is really helpful and saves a lot of walking between exhibits
,,Fair Feathered Friends,5.0,,"3rd visit with our grandchildren..always exciting, always excited! Excellent layout & facilities and there always seems to be something new to experience!"
,,Very good,4.0,,"We took our 1.5 year old to the bird park and it was an enjoyable experience. It has been made so child friendly that it's a treat and allows parents to enjoy their day out too.

The entire bird park is well signed and together with the maps easy to navigate with a stroller. They also provide the option of a tram like vehicle should you get tired of walking. There are adequate bathroom and diaper changing facilities and also places to take a break and eat etc.

All of us enjoyed the bird displays especially the penguins, the hornbills and toucans, emu, ostrich."
,,visit it before it is moved,5.0,,"nice ambience, kids love how some of the birds just roam by near them. they get to learn the traits of birds via displayed information and some audio as wel.."
,,One of the best in the World,5.0,,"We loved the bird park and thought that it big, beautiful and lovingly cared for. I am not a fan of birds in cages but these birds had really large enclosures. The main show was very well done and thoroughly enjoyed seeing the birds swooping around. The only drawback for the show was the woman presenter's voice which was a little annoying along with her constant nervous laugh - otherwise a great show."
,,A wide variety of birds,5.0,,You ride the mrt and go down to boon lay station ride a bus in my recollection its c9 or ask the staff what is the bus going to jurong bird park the transportation is very easy our entrance ticket includes tram ride would suggest to do this if you have kids with you or you can walk all the way this is the largest bird paradise in asia i guess and there is a lot of attractions. And food and souvenir shops inside you can bring your bottle water for this activity i suggest you go early so you can tour around and watch all the program in the afternoon. And a close encounter to all the birds
,,Worth a visit.,5.0,,"A word of advice - wear comfortable shoes as the park is huge and will take you all day to get through it. There are numerous different bird species. A lot of these birds, you'd only ever see, when you watch ""David Attenborough's Nature Shows""!! If you love colourful birds and exotic birds, this is a place to go."
,,Great Visit,5.0,,"We booked our ticket online, we opted for a 2park option and also visited the Zoo. Was easy travel to the park by MRT & bus thus no need to pay for taxi. The park was great! They even had birds near the entrance for a photo shoot. We managed to watch the 2 bird shows of the afternoon. Overall was a day well spent with loads of memories."
,,Lovely experience for kids and adults,5.0,,"Though quite far from the city limits, bard park is a must visit for kids especially. The loads of fun that one gets during the shows is an experience. Loved the macau, kite flamingo shows. The aviary gives you an opportunity to learn more about birds, hatching, feeding and growth phases. Staff is very helpful. has an open kids play area with good restaurants and amenities."
,,Great day out,5.0,,So much fun we spent a full day here and so much to see. I think we enjoyed even more than the zoo. Pay for your tickets online and it’s much cheaper to see this and the zoo together or see the night safari for half the price when gotten together
,,Great time at Bird Park,5.0,,"Stress releasing watching birds, relaxed with cart travels and long walk; Excellent food, shops and amenities."
,,Amazing show,5.0,,"Totally love the high flyer show! ITS A MUST WATCH or you’ll miss out big time. Lory Loft was amazing too. Aside from that, the staff was friendly and helpful. Despite having 2 young children in stroller, its easy to get around the park."
,,Funfilled Easter Sunday,4.0,,"My daughter had an enjoyable sunday finding easter eggs, having her favorite penguins n flamingo was a MUST! We enjoy the show too! Had a great family outing. Thanks you Jurong Bird Park."
,,Birds v animals,5.0,,"Between birds and animals, birds are more exuberant than animals. Most animals at the zoo are sleeping. Birds is aviaries are always active. That's the difference between birds and animals which make bird shows particularly exciting and fun filled. Kudos to having a bird park - always enjoy trips there."
,,Great day out!,4.0,,We had a great day at the bird park. There is a good range of local and non local birds. The one thing that I found disappointing was that not all signs indicated the provenance of the birds.
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,This was my third visit to the Jurong Bird Park and everytime it is equally enjoyable. My kids love it too.
,,Jurong Bird Park Singapore,4.0,,"An excellent family outing venue for all ages. The Park is clean, staff are professional and cheerful. The bird are pretty and the most memorable are both the bird shows."
,,Jurong Bird Park - must visit!,5.0,,"Must watch attraction! Best when covered by foot. The expanse and the beauty of the park can be relished only when we walk through tge entire trail slowly and absorb the scenic beauty in every section. The Waterfall place and the ecosystem around it is simply beautiful. All in all, this park is definitely worth a wholesome visit."
,,Amazing Experience for Kids!!!,4.0,,"This is the 4rth time i have been to jurong Bird park, recent one was with my daughter 2yrs old, she just loved watching the penguin's, was hard for me to get her eyes off.. it also has a play area for kids, who can get soaked in water.. This bird park has too many varieties of parrots, diverse collection of birds... Its a small and lovely place to bring your kids and spend the whole day without any fuss for food or enjoyment.."
,,A lovely way to spend an afternoon,5.0,,"This bird park is amazing! I try to stay away from zoos and bird parks because in the past I have found the birds and animals in bad condition. This park is the best I have ever seen, the enclosures are massive with lots of enrichment. The two shows are very interesting as well, the best I’ve seen. It also started raining in the high flyers (3pm 12/4/18) and the handler/ presenter handled it so well! She moved the birds out of the rain into the crowd and continued the show! I really have to commend her quick thinking and her confidence. The later show was good as well and the presenter was so enthusiastic with his facts. There was lots to lean within the park which I enjoyed. I spent three hours here would of spent probably 30 mins to and hour more if the park wasn’t closing. You can feed and interact with lots of animals ( we fed the penguins at 3:30) for such a good price of $2!.
I think they need to remove products that have palm oil, I saw some in the shop near the waterfall (tao kae noi seaweed snacks). As the park talks about habitat destruction etc."
,,A lot of interactive activities,5.0,,"The park is small, and there is a small train.Walking with young children will be a little tired, because there will be hillsides.It's very important to plan ahead in advance, because we can't miss all kinds of birds performance.The performance of birds is very interactive and interesting.You and the children can take part in feeding Parrots.This makes the children excited."
,,Amaging Bird Park!!,5.0,,"This park probably got one of the diverse birds collection in the world including pet, wild, prey and extinct (I guess) variety. In addition to look these birds closely, the park authority organize two birds show: one with pet and other with prey birds in two different places within the park compound. These comes free when you buy entry ticket."
,,Beautiful Experience,5.0,,"We took the kids to see the Jurong Bird Park and although we had earlier planned to spend half a day, we ended up spending the entire day here as thee was so much to see and do. The bird park is well maintained and surprisingly clean. You will see some amazing collection of birds and the colors are spectacular. You can also fee the birds and take pics with them. Enjoy the experience."
,,Interesting and different.,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park was both interesting and different although I've got to say that this was not the best bird park I have visited.
The ""bird show"" itself was directed towards families with young children, which is certainly a good thing but perhaps not quite so captivating for those of us who were older.
I'm sure that the bird park would be excellent for those intent on recording their experiences through their cameras.
Well worth a visit."
,,Day Out with Toddler,4.0,,"Good
- The shows were fantastic - highly educational and entertaining
- The water park was a great way to keep my three year old occupied for an hour and a half - he had a whale of a time splashing around
- The tram ride was enjoyable (tip - better to take the tram after lunch and after the shows when the hoards of tourists are gone)
- my toddler enjoyed the paleontologist pit as well

can be improved
- changing rooms and toilets were very clean
- food was mediocre"
,,Lovely trip for a solo amateur photographer,5.0,,"Had a weekend alone so thought I would visit the park with my camera alone. The forecasty was for afternoon so I decided to go to the park early to avoid this and the crowds and am glad I did. The mood was relaxing around the park at 9am when I arrived and I was able to check out a number of birds and take photos with no other people in them. I loved the immersive areas and the free range bird areas although I am not a fan of birds in cages so avoided most of the parrots. The shows were incredible though, especially the vultures in the birds of prey show. The staff are all very knowledgeable and they really push the conservation message which is great, even promoting bringing reusable water bottles and places to fill up on the way. The park is large but I managed to walk it in 3 hours without having to rely on the train which was pretty busy during the mid morning, The penguins were gorgeous and the puffins great to see and I loved the beautiful pink spoonbills and duck varieties. There are certainly a large array of birds! There are a couple of food places but I didn't eat and also toilet facilities dotted around. Had a great day and will be back again., Thanks!"
,,"Visually Captivating, Inclusive and Memorable!",4.0,,"We held our team bonding at Jurong Bird Park on Easter Sunday. Our team members were made up of mostly seniors (above 60 years old). We were very grateful to the staff for their considerations and accommodation!
Visually captivating - our seniors were liven up by the vibrant colours, vast variety of birds and their flights also energized them! Most of them had not visited the Jurong Bird Park for more than 10 years. It was reminiscing and they did a walk down the memory lane.

Inclusive - We also noticed that the multi-lingual introduction panels at Lory Loft included Braille for the visually-impaired visitors. There are regular tram services and gradual slopes to facilitate mobility.

Our seniors were happy with the team bonding session carried out and created a lot more happy memories at the Hanging Bridge, Waterfall Aviary and Heliconia Walk. Thank you Jurong Bird Park!"
,,Egg hunt 2018,2.0,,"Was very disappointed with the Peter rabbit egg hunt this year comparing with last year’s Smurf theme. As we went specially for that, it was totally not worth it. Otherwise the birds are alright."
,,Awesome but tainted,4.0,,"This bird park is fabulous - the most impressive are the walk in aviaries especially where you can feed the birds.

I am as not comfortable with some of the smaller cages for the smallest birds and definitely not impressed that the biggest birds and birds of prey are in smaller cages than the colourful Australian birds. I would like to walk through a covered area into a massive bird of prey area.

I am opposed to the concept of caged animals and for the most part was impressed with this park with the exception of the birds of prey. I believe They could do with even more space"
,,Asia’s largest bird paradise,4.0,,"This is Asia’s largest bird paradise over 5000 colorful birds across 400 species. We enjoyed watching these beautiful creatures, penguins can be seen at the entrance, macaus birds was fun to watch and got the chance to hold birds in wooden sticks. There is also a tram service which you can avail to make you feel relax by not walking and if you are travelling with children. It also has tallest man-made waterfall which will mesmerize you by its beauty.
Recommended Tour Duration: 2 hours

How to reach – MRT (Boon lay station) and then take Bus No. 194.

Opening Time: 8:30 AM to 6 PM"
,,Lovely Day,5.0,,We had a lovely day out at the bird park so much to see. The indoor aviary and waterfall were a major highlight. Only issue is it isn’t that accessible - need to get an Uber
,,Amazing bird park!,5.0,,"Jorong Bird Park is lively, colourful, and well-maintained. The aviaries are large and lush, giving the birds plenty of space to fly. We loved both bird shows. It's a great deal to have your 1-day pass converted into a year pass with no extra charge. I highly recommend it!"
,,bird’s eye view in our own homeland,4.0,,engaging performances & interesting array of species to look at n learn from wonderful nature sanctuary
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"My family and i with two young kids visited the jurong bird park on the 5th of april 2018. Watched the shows and we simply loved both shows. Especially the High flyers show. We watched both the 11 and 3pm show.
Both the presenters did an awesome job. Managed to see different kinds of birds compared from the 11am and 3pm such as the hornbill part.
My kids had too many questions that they went down to ask the presenter. Both the ladies( couldn’t remember their names. Oops) were very patient and answered my children’s ridiculous questions in a kiddy way. Will definitely recommend the bird park and the High flyers show. Will be back again."
,,Entertaining Bird show and nice picnic,4.0,,Its a 3-4 hrs nice getaway for kids. Bird show is also great. Preferably walk than taking tram if you want to take a look at birds. Not many eating options here. Its far from city center.
,,Great bird park,4.0,,"There are a wide range of birds in this relatively compact park. There is a lovely aviary where some beautiful peacocks and other birds wandering around. Amazing to see swans, flamingoes and beautiful parrots all in one park! Regards Omar"
,,Good experience,3.0,,The park took us 4-5 hours. This included two shows and 4 feedings which were the highlight. Some birds in cages were pretty hard to see like the hornbill. Go early. Very far from the city. Almost no public transport. We took a cab. Can make for a long day.
,,So so,3.0,,Disappointed with peter rabbit theme. Limited eateries option. Difficult for young family to find suitable dining option and spend longer time in park.
,,Very entertaining,5.0,,"We spent a good 4 hours here. The shows are really good and the Hornbill Chat was outstanding. It is just a keeper with his bird explaining about them and answering any questions

You need to plan your time here because there is lots to see and many of the specific activities are worth attending. Spend some time when you first get there to figure out what order to see the various birds and activities so you can maximise your experience.

The array of birds is expansive.

We went by MRT and connecting bus service which is perfectly synchronised. We took a shuttle service from there to the Zoo which cost $6.00. Not bad value considering the alternatives and how much time it saves."
,,Love the Easter Egg hunt organised by the bird park!,4.0,,The kids had so much fun with the egg hunt and watching the bird show at the amphitheater. A good place to spend your day with young children
,,Rundown bird park with many depressed birds,2.0,,"We visited Jurong bird park only because we bought 4-park admission tickets (3-park is not available). Should we spend $30 to visit this, we would have been very disappointed. Location is quite far from city, we caught Uber because it is far from MRT, you need to catch bus.

The park is old and rundown, looks like the birds and cages were not properly taken care. The water sections (flamingo, pelican and swan) are dirty. King of the Skies show was not impressive. Not worth the time and money.

The only thing good is the penguins. Plenty of penguins, I really enjoyed watching penguins."
,,Beautiful birds,5.0,,Such a beautiful setting for watching birds. You can watch feedings & bird shows. All are well spaced out so you can attend them all if you plan it right. I really enjoyed the waterfall aviary. Spent at least an hour in there. So many free-ranging birds to see. All the exhibits are easy to get to. Plenty of bathrooms and water spots around the park.
,,Egg-citing,5.0,,"Went on 24/03/18 with my 6 yr old girl. She had lots of fun at the water play area. The day we went, they had Easter activities and Meet and Greet with Peter Rabbit. Had fun around the area collecting colour easter eggs as well...More"
,,May be you can go,3.0,,I am not a bird watcher but yes the place has got beautiful birds to see and the noises of the birds are like music. May be you can go

,,Good work part,5.0,,"If you have kids in your group, it is a worth place to visit. Lots of birds and bird shows are worth to attend. Penguin at the entrance are added feature. Must visit, however far from city centre and require half day to visit this."
,,Inspiring to conserve biodiversity,5.0,,"In addition to the wide variety of “winged animals “, Jurong Bird Park houses marmosets and Tamarins. Simplistically these are mini monkeys and small monkeys. Marmosets are about 20 centimetres (8 in) long and are native to South America and have been found in Bolivia,...More"
,,Best Laksa in Town,4.0,,"Eat the laksa in the restaurant just at exit of Bird Park. You will love it, in the air conditioned restaurant"
,,"Impressive setup, value for $",4.0,,I spent over 3 hours in the afternoon but could easily have spent longer as the 3 shows I watched took up nearly 1/2 the time. Fabulous setup. Loved the ability to interact with birds & for a small coin donation could feed or water...More
,,Delightful experience,4.0,,"The bird park is tucked away on the west of Singapore so it is located some distance away from the other wildlife parks. So it's harder to hop from one park to another if you decide to go there. Nevertheless, the park is well maintained...More"
,,Eye Opening Experience,4.0,,"This tourist attraction takes about 4 hours to complete if you want to see every single attraction. It is better to go early because there are several shows during the whole day and if you go late you may miss some of them. Must see attractions: Lory Loft, Waterfall Aviary. Also do not miss the parrots show and hawk show."
,,Bring your friends,5.0,,"This is one of the best Singapore has to offer. We brought guests here and they had a blast. To ensure that you make the most of it, go to the shows!! they are very interactive recommended for all ages. Would recommend for all ages, Some animals were outside, some were viewed in air-conditioned rooms. Excellent service. A shuttle car-thingy brings you to one of the 4 stops in the park if you don't feel like walking (recommended)."
,,Bird Zone,5.0,,"A superb bird park, where you more than 100 species of birds to view. Flamingos are a treat. The huge cage birds are rare. Their are points where you can feed parrots. A half day tour is enough to this place, well connected by bus services."
,,Bird's wonder world,5.0,,"This visit to Jurong Bird Park was probably the 10th visit. Still it raised our energy level despite of sweltering heat and humidity. The beautifully kept bird park, probably the best in the world, invites visitors from across the globe of all ages. The lory loft, parrot paradise, waterfall aviary, dinosaur descendants, pelican cove were outstanding. The birds with least endangered to almost extinct can be seen here. The tram ride inside the park touching different attractions is truly outstanding and convenient. One can get down, see the attractions and get on the next tram conveniently. The bird shows were exquisite which are held at different times. The visitors must see the timing in advance so that these shows are not missed out. Overall, a wonderful place to spend with family for a full day full of activities. A small piece of advise would be to visit during weekdays if possible to avoid huge crowd on weekends."
,,Superb attraction,5.0,,"One of the kid friendly attraction Iloved visiting. .well managed attarcation...lot of birds to see. Clean and hygienic place

Bird show is the usp of the place.

Highly recommended for kids

Being an Indian, happen to savour tasty indian food in indian restuarant outside the park near the entrance.

Food was awesome."
,,Main attractions in Singapore,5.0,,"A very attractive tourist destination in Singapore and have good arrangements to visit the park for all ages. The trail on tram, various shows etc describe the park and its features very well. Additionally one can travel all along to view and observe the birds in a comfortable caging facility."
,,Bird park has no OWL,3.0,,Could not find a single owl in the bird park. Will never go back again. Food and drink were tip top expensive. Ice lemon tea at $5.50/CUP.
,,wonderful birds view,4.0,,If you are bird's lover you must be here. lots of birds species. Amazing. Hot weather and humidity makes tour limited but you will get over.
,,unique and fascinating,5.0,,We've visited other parts of the Zoo several times but this was a first. Variety of birds and the setting and display are unique. Interested to see how it responds if the planned move to the Zoo complex occurs. Definitely worth a visit in its current location.
,,Variety of Birds in Open Space,5.0,,"If you are a animal lover and specially birds, then you should visit this palace. Large varity of birds, which are kept in open (majority one) and kept in well maintained environment.
Half day should be enough to cover this place. Eating options are in-side zoo, but little expensive side.
Its connected to MRT and Bus (depend which root you are taking), there Is also shuttle service but on specific times."
,,Great day!,5.0,,"Nice park! Lots to see, tons of different birds. There a large waterfall enclosed area that is cool to walk through. Costs about $20 USD to get in. A few shops/restaurants inside. It is pretty hot walking around but there's also a tram option. Nice way to spend a few hours. If coming from downtown Singapore it's easy to take the MRT and bus since there's a stations literally right out front. Overall, a nice stop."
,,A surreal tropical paradise!!,5.0,,"We have an annual membership and we visit all the wildlife parks in Singapore frequently. However, the Jurong bird park stands out among them, and has wowed us every single time. Its an exceptionally beautiful paradise with so much to explore. Unfortunately, a lot of people hop on to a tram and miss out on a lot of things. You cannot catch a glimpse of the birds from a moving tram in the road. I would recommend exploring the park by foot and carry a map to explore every inch of the park. The highlights in the park is the open viewing experience in several places where you can watch the birds in open. The newly renovated parrots section is another highlight with so many varieties."
,,We could have spent hours here,5.0,,"No wait, we did spend multiple hours here. What a great place to visit in a Singapore. We took the train and the bus and it was easy to get to from town. The rain didn’t stop us and it certainly helped keep the crowds away. The exhibits are just incredible and it is unbelievable walking inside some of the aviaries. The waterfall area is something else.

The only negative would be the food. Be sure to take your own snacks as their restaurants are not very good and they are extremely over priced. Other than that, no complaints as it was a great day."
,,Too many mosquitos,3.0,,"Too many mosquitos at the Aquatic area with fishes, need to bring repellent especially if you are bringing kids there. Mosquito patches doesn't work."
,,great family fun,5.0,,nice playground and water play area for kids. nice peter rabbit deco for pictures. the bird show was entertaining and awesome. will def bring kiddos there again!
,,a family day out place,4.0,,"if your with family in Singapore this place is a must , very big collection of birds the big huge feeding cage is a wow ,sad about the birds of pray being in small cages but there must be a reason for that. lots of fine gifts for back home , loved the place."
,,DAY OUT with Birds !!!!,4.0,,"A place where every adult/teen and kids will rejoice and forever.

DO REMEMBER TO TAKE BIRD PARK MAP which are available at entry of zoo, it is really helpful.

Up and close encounter with all the species (Wild and Terrain Birds like Vulture etc), Session with Exotic birds and Swams..

The Bird park is very outside of city and will take approx 1 hour to reach, once there you can get in and host of restaurants available for refreshments.

Jurong Bird park is must visit and prepare to walk a lot as the inter transport is available but it won't stop at specific animal point as the bus will stop at his station only.

But a good walking will take you at all attractions of Birds."
,,Mixed thoughts on this place,3.0,,"A lot of the birds were kept in aviaries that were quite small, especially given the large size of some of the birds (e.g. the birds of prey) and the number of birds kept in one cage (e.g. the macaws). They all should have been in way bigger areas. However, some of the birds were kept in forested areas with netting to keep them in, so they had a lot of space to fly around. But most seemed in smaller aviaries."
,,Good collection of birds,3.0,,The bird park was ok there was lots of different birds to view the park felt a little run down but nevertheless the birds all seemed well cared for.
,,A day out at the Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"I brought my daughter and her friend who are 8 years old to the Jurong Bird Park during the school holiday. They had a great day exploring every single corner and visited all bird species there. They loved the close interaction opportunities with the free roaming birds in many of the enclosures. The explanation are clear, but they find it quite hard to spot some of the birds, especially the eagles. It’s a pity that the owl enclosure was closed. It used to be the most exciting part of the visit when they were much younger. They learned a lot at the Breeding and Research Centre too."
,,A beautiful and extensive bird park,5.0,,Jurong offers a wide variety of birds to photograph and observe. It is a great place to take kids and let them experience the wildlife in a constrained environment more so to create awareness that wildlife is best left in the wild.
,,Recommended for Kids,4.0,,"I went there before few years back it was really fascinating. But this time around seems somewhat unkempt. Nevertheless, i think we should give our support as it is not easy and not cheap to maintain this park."
,,A bird-lovers paradise,5.0,,Every time in Singapore I visit Jurong Bird Park and thoroughly enjoy it. There appears something for everyone from the well presented flying bird shows to the secluded atmosphere of the walk-through aviaries. I prefer the latter as the birds have become fearless of humans and closely intermingle with visitors. The spectacular walk-through waterfall aviary has now matured into a natural paradise for its inhabitants with many birds well-acclimatised and breeding there. I look forward to my next visit.
,,A Lovely afternoon,4.0,,"Maybe I was lucky but there were no queues when I went, despite what I’d read on trip advisor. After the metro, walk 100m through the mall ( just follow the signs) get the bus 2 stops to the park. There was a little train going through the park for $3. You can get on and off at any of the 3 stops. Worth every penny. The bird park itself was ok but it wasn’t top of my list of things to do. The indoor waterfall was lovely and the general walk around very nice too. The blue macaws were my favourite as I hadn’t seen them before. At Lori loft I saw 2 little birds only. The high flyers show was very good and enjoyed by all. As an optional extra you can hire disabled scooters, $38 strollers and trundle trucks (for the kids) for the day"
,,Well maintain...,5.0,,"Been a while since the last trip to the park, nothing much has changed... clean, well maintain and the staff is friendly and helpful whenever we need any assistance... 👍👍👍"
,,Lots of people,2.0,,Lots of people as it was Sunday and it was difficult to find things.Many birds were caged and everything looked unnatural.Not enough space to sit or rest.when I went for the bird show it was already finished.So its best not to visit the park on public holidays
,,One of the biggest birds park in the world,4.0,,Very interesting to watch the shows in the Jurong Bird park. Usually the shows will be done once in the morning and once again in the afternoon. So plan the time accordingly. If you want to walk slowly and enjoy the day in nature you can comfortably spend a day in this park. The climate will be more humid so go with the comfortable outfits and water bottle. Drinking water point is available at many locations where you can fill your bottle. The park keepers are very friendly and I'm sure you'll enjoy your trip. Suits for all ages of visitors.
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,"With a 8 year old, the experience at the bird work is very very educative and enjoyable. The show with the talking parrot was very entertaining and at the same time they conveyed the message of conservation. The tram makes the visit less tiring. The 360degree feeding area was simply amazing with the birds on your head, and shoulders and hands and feeding out of your hands is great experience. Overall a must visit place for families with kids."
,,Loads of awesome birds but not stroller friendly at all,4.0,,We took our 18month old daughter here and she loved it. The penguins and many types of hornbill were a particular highlight for all of us. However it is very difficult to get a stroller around unless u just follow the road. No signage indicating steps ahead in places meant a few u turns with a loaded up stroller. We did have a great time and the kids water park is also a great feature. Having an annual pass for the zoo means we'll defo be back again.
,,Great park,4.0,,Very interesting. Loved seeing so many different types of birds. Quite big and very nice to walk around. Will definitely visit again
,,Enjoyable and delightful,5.0,,my 3 yr old and i enjoyed walking through the aviaries and feeding the birds. it was a very nice experience. the place is so full of greenery and birds chirping. will be back again for sure.
,,Visit to Jurong Bird park,5.0,,This bird park was a quite different experience to me. The Jurong bird park shows are awesome.This tour can take around 3 hours just to have an overview of all species.
,,The best bird park,5.0,,"Reached by morning, nearly spent a half day there. Though trams available we walked fully. Just be on time for feeding small birds on the bridge. Don't ever miss the bird show which was totally amazing"
,,The 4th Time,5.0,,"I have visited Jurong Bird Park again for the fourth time; again to show friends I was travelling through to Europe with. The first time was a half day on an overnight stopover, but now I have learnt so much more about Singapore, I schedule longer stops there. The Jurong Bird Park is one reason for this. Initially to mitigate the effects of long-haul flights; now it is because Singapore is a destination in its own right. While the park has changed over the years I have been visiting, the proximity, diversity and tranquility of the Bird Park has not. Allow a day to leisurely wander around and enjoy the spectacle."
,,Highlight of a Singapore Tour,5.0,,"Recently brought some friends here after opting for the Bird Park of the Night Safari and the Singapore Zoo. We were all highly satisfied with the decision. The bird park is quite unique, in that the rare and beautiful birds are inside a cage that people are allowed into. Essentially, we were in several bird cages with the birds. One beautiful bird after another. Up close and personal. We are big fans of birds and so the JBP was a really nice treat for all parties. Highly recommend (with/without kids)!"
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,we arrived mid morning and missed flamingo feeding birds well kept just loved the parrots and macaw smissed the bird of prey show train takes you around the parkwhich was sad as we are bird lovers 100% in Australia
,,Excellent collection,5.0,,This is probably one of the largest bird parks in the world with huge collection of different species of birds. There are few bird shows as well which shouldn't be missed. Great place for photographers and bird watchers.
,,Only birds,2.0,,"There are quite a limited number of bird species as far as I can remember after the trip just today.

And some like the birds of paradise depends on your luck on spotting them.

Clear views of toucans and hornbills. Can’t remember much about eagles or owls. Far off from town.

Suggest to visit zoo rather than bird park unless u are in Singapore for a week or more and have time to spare!
Quite boring for me after I’ve been to the zoo. Zoo is definitely more interesting."
,,Excellent place for bird lovers!,5.0,,A must recommended place who are bird lovers. Enthusiastic natural environment with different types of birds collected from all over the world. The ride of the whole area was excellent.
,,Must visit place,5.0,,"Extremely well maintained enclosures , with innumerable birds from all over the world. It is place to unwind. Move on foot , slowly , you will be amazed to see the diverse collection. Especially the vibrantly colourful parrots.
The Penguin enclosure is very also very nice , though tough to maintain the sub zero temperatures in the heat of Singapore."
,,Big birds in small cages,2.0,,"I did not like this place at all. While they had an interesting array of birds they did not look happy and amny cages seemed far too small for the size and number of birds.
The food here is absolutely disgusting and to be avoided at all times.
The place was clean - no rubbish around and well signposted. I just felt sorry for the birds!"
,,Beautiful birds,4.0,,I had been to the Bird Park when I lived in Singapore - back in 2013 and previously many years ago. It is looking a bit tired in places but a nice way to spend a few hours. The birds are beautiful and it great to be able to go into the Lori Loft and have the birds land on you and feed from a small cup of bird food that you can purchase. There are a few places to eat and a gift shop. If you can ride the small tram and hop on and off at the exhibits. The cost of taxi from the city to the park was approximately $25.
,,If you like Birds you must make this trip,5.0,,Fantastic - you need all day here. The train gets you close then a short bus trip - 10 mins tops. Well worth it - lots of different enclosures - the shows are a little bit naff of course but they are well spaced out so that you can catch them. The best areas are those where the birds are enclosed and flying around you - they don't even know they are not free - they are happily building nests and getting on with it - great!
,,Awesome,5.0,,"We visited late in February and just loved it our visit. The attractions are clean and spacious and the birds all look in excellent health. The shows are definitely worth the effort in particular the penguin feeding (tip: bring lots of $1 coins and $2 notes as there no change is given for most of the interactive aspects).

One should also make time to visit the huge enclosure opposite tram stop 2. Here u can feed the beautiful and friendly lorikeets some nectar (tip: hold onto the cup tightly and expect the birds to land on you)...lots of fun!

Will definitely come back..."
,,Better than expected!,5.0,,"The bird park was brilliant. The birds that are there amazed me. There are so many species of birds, it is a very educational visit. It is great for children too, as they will be a amazed too at them, and its nice for them to learn about these things early on in life."
,,So many birds,5.0,,"We have visited a number of times over 30 years and can see definite changes every time. One significant change is the amount of vegetation which not only makes the place 'greener' but protects visitors from the sun over much of the site.

There are the usual standard birds there, but also ones you are unlikely to see elsewhere. The bird shows are not too tacky.

To get the full experience, I would recommend spending about 5 hours there, and get there as early as possible. Travel to Boon Lay MRT and then take the no 194 bus to the park.

There are water dispensers all over the park, so you only need to take an empty bottle. Food is available inside the park and outside the entrance, both local and fast food. Expect to pay more than you would in the city, but not too excessive.

The bird park is due to close in 2020, and to co-locate with the zoo at Mandai Lake."
,,Tickets with Tram ride,3.0,,No need to include tram ride while purchasing entry tickets to bird park unless you have very senior people or infants in your team. Stations of tram are in such a way that you cannot enjoy some attractions in between
,,Nicely laid out and lots of shows to see,5.0,,"They have made the best of the space available at this park and have a great variety of birds to see. There is a ""hop on, hop off"" tram trip that goes all around if you don't want to walk too far. There are shows every hour or so where they tell you a lot about the species and the birds entertain you with tricks! We visited by MRT to Boon Lay on the East/West line then got the 194 bus which runs every 12 minutes and costs $1.60 each way."
,,Avian nature mingles with urban life,5.0,,"Among all the notable tourist attraction at Singapore Jurong bird park is one of the premier one. Me along with my family spent very nice time there. This is a family-friendly adventure among various bird species. The entry area is very colorful & beautiful which creates a very positive reaction among the visitors. We took the Panorail for a panoramic look at the bird park. It took long to get into as presence of tourists was huge. The Panorail travels through the park divided into different zones each facilitates with tram station. But walking through pathway is more appropriate to explore the aviary. It is home to thousands of birds across hundreds of species. There is a huge waterfall which adds different flavor really.

The most memorable part is the Birds & Buddies show which runs twice a day and features characters in colorful costumes. 11 am is the most suitable time. Kids enjoyed a lot. The host of the show Ms. Durga is such expert that she can control the the trained birds while presenting them at a wide pavilion to give super fun to the visitors.

We also fed the birds with foods provided by park authority & birds were found very usual to be seated on our hands in a flock. Another most important part is the penguin exhibit, which features an underwater viewing gallery to watch the penguins. My kids enjoyed penguins very much. They took some pictures with them.

This is really worthy one to visit Jurong Bird Park."
,,Loved this!,5.0,,"The walk in aviary with the waterfall is huge, and would be impressive if this was the park in its own right. However it is one of many. One of my favourite places in Singapore. I'm still wondering why the flamingos don't fly away!"
,,A Birdie Pardise,5.0,,The Jurong Bird Park is a fairly big place and as such it is advisable to take the tram-trolley to go around. The collection of winged creatures is enormous. The most unique being the pink flamingos.
,,great birds great show,4.0,,"So many variety of birds, and some great shows worth a visit , ypou can reach this place via MRT and the a short journey via bus 194 which also drops you back to the MRT on your return , if you have a MRT card the same can be used for your bus ride , you can buy your tickets to the park online at a discount"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Words simply cannot describe how great this place is. Singapore really knows how to go all in when it comes to zoological gardens (it is actually part of the zoo). Huge variety of birds, and two quite large walk in aviaries. Loved the hornbills."
,,Beautiful varieties of bird,5.0,,We had so much fun in the park especially flamingo zone was very beautiful garden set. The garden set in tropical style like you were in Amazon.
,,Not as nice as before,2.0,,"I had other good memory about this place since I was actually often here when I was living in Singapore before as 'Expat'. Soon after got our ticket, the lady told me that the parrot I love, died already. Was a clever one. She told me the trainer can't teach the new parrot like the one before. It was a special one."
,,Fantastic experience!,5.0,,Been a few times with children. Took my parents who absolutely loved it. It was a feast to the eyes with the range of colours and the 400 different species seen. Great day out for family.
,,"Events, Bird and kid friendly",5.0,,Very well organised and great facilities. Great place for kids. On the eve of Chinese New YEar they had lion dance and some activity. The bird show called birds of play is must see. Do get a tram ticket.
,,I am in love with the birds here!,5.0,,"I have never seen the variety of birds that i saw here in this bird park. Its fun and fantastic, do make sure to be ready to walk a lot and wear a sun block. Prepare yourself with umbrellas as it suddenly rains any moment in Singapore. Bird show, parrot feeding, its a beautiful place with many aviaries to visit inside the park. It has certain visiting hours do make a note of it and needs a ticket too."
,,Educational trip,4.0,,Properly organized and clean. Kids will enjoy looking at the many types of birds in the park. Friendly staff.
,,Great experience,4.0,,The bird park allows us to connect with various species of birds! Just fascinating! The bird shows were just mesmerising! Cant wait to go back!
,,Allow plenty of time.,4.0,,"After a journey of just over an hour using the MRT and then a bus we arrived at the bird park. We opted to use the tram as we didn’t have a great deal of time but we would have been quicker walking as we had to queue for 20 minutes to use the tram. (I think the $5 fee to use the tram is a bit steep). It is quite a hilly park so the walk wouldn’t suite everyone, especially on a hot day.
The park however is lovely with a vast variety of birds, some of which are endangered. It’s reassuring to see that the park is working hard towards the conservation of birds like the Macaw and not just opening as a tourist attraction.
On leaving we joined the queue for a taxi and waited 30 minutes before it was our turn. Fortunately it was only a 20 minute drive back to our hotel."
,,Not enough time here,5.0,,We would have liked more time here as we missed seeing the Birds of Paradise as we were rushed. One other person in our group spent half an hour with one group of birds that they missed seeing a large portion of the Park. The range of birds is wonderful and they all appear to be very well cared for. We were told by the tourist guide that we must go on the train but we did not do that and were glad that we didn't as it would have used up the limited time we had there for seeing the birds. I would allow at least 3 hours to see everything properly.
,,Pink Flamingos,5.0,,"This place is amazing, full of all kinds of birds, flowers and so much more, not just for kids but for the adults. A small train takes you all around with stops, where you can hop on and then off spending more admiring ...must visit"
,,Still fun after many years.,4.0,,It's been decades since my last visit to the park and it's still fun and educational. Some of the highlights such as the loft was really good.
,,First Class Bird Park,4.0,,"My family, including 5 year old son, thoroughly enjoyed our visit. There is a lot of walking and much of it is hilly. Much of it has little shade!! There are ""trains"" but they are not so convenient and often very long ques for them. The penguins, with so many breeds was amazing. The birds are well kept. 2-3 hours is about the time needed. It is quite a ride to get there. We had to wait quite a long time, in the heat, to get a taxi back into the city"
,,Feels like Bird Prison and a tourist trap at times,2.0,,"The conditions the birds have to put up with are not good at all. Cages are very small, some of the larger birds can hardly ever move around. Jurong Bird Prison would be a more suitable name for some of what you see. As for the visitor experience, the park is very commercialized. More often than not it feels like it's all about selling food, drinks, and other trinkets, while the birds are just a sideshow, and when you want to leave, you discover the only way out is to walk through a gift shop and a restaurant, as there is no other exit. Still, at least you as a visitor can eventually get out of this tourist trap, while the birds don't have this luxury. On the upside, all the staff were friendly, and the labels are interestingly written in good English. The birds themselves are magnificent but the area of the park is too small to host so many species, which is especially noticeable with the larger birds of prey, and some of the toucans."
,,Beautiful birds- must do in Sinagpore!,5.0,,"This is a must do in Singapore if you have young children. See the schedule of shows/feeding before hand and plan your day accordingly.

Do not miss:
- High Fliers show: It is a delightful show including various beautiful birds including (but not limited to) hornbills, toucans, cockatoos, flamingos. It has audience participation, so be ready :)
- King of the Skies show: Very nice show with various birds of prey, I have never seen such huge vultures.
- Lory Loft: It is huge enclosure with several bridges where you can walk and see the colourful lorries. You can(must) buy 2/3$ feed that they give in a small plastic bowl. The lorries will come to you to feed from the bowl, it is a very unique experience.
- Feeding time at the waterfall aviary. You can see beautiful coloured birds all together at the feeding time.

There are several enclosures where you can see different birds, be ready to walk to explore the full zoo."
,,So many birds.. few rare.. too many repeats,4.0,,"for me, there were 45 highlights... penguins, african penguins, blue macaws, Cassowary and bird breeding place! they really do take care of their birds.. all birds looks pretty healthy and seems to have enough space to fly around and hideout, if they don't feel like revealing themselves. this is something i really admire.
they also have a really tall human-made waterfall inside the park with the upper walking area, which let you get closer to the birds. some of the free-flying birds are sooo use to humans, that they don't even bother to fly away like the birds we find back at home; in fact, they comfortably walk around and fly off when they feel like. some birds even gives you perfect poses!
like in the zoo, each category of birds have it's own museum sort area and they have really educating bird shows as well. it can get really tiring, so always carry something cool and water with you. also don't forget to take the advantage of their tramp ride... you going to need it!
this a very family experience which can take from good 4-6hrs.. better not schedule anything else till night, because it can get very tiring. Also, go early as possible :)
There is no straight MRT stop. you need to get down from Boon Lay and then get 194."
,,Interesting way to spend day.,4.0,,"As birding people, we went to the Bird Park to see some of the non-captive inhabitants as well as the beautiful captive birds. We came by taxi from Orchard Rd and came after 10 am to avoid the traffic but going back, we were caught up, so try to leave by 3.30 or else use public transport.
The flight aviaries are spectacular and the birds easy to see. Some of the identification signage does not include all the birds in that aviary but is mostly good. The birds are beautiful and range from small to large, colourful to fairly plain and very loud to very quiet. I would recommend the Lory Loft, the hornbills and the Waterfall aviary. There are plenty of shelters if it rains and small cafes dotted around the site. If you can't stand the humidity, I would recommend paying a little extra for the tram to get from place to place. The bird show was a bit kitsch for me but others really enjoyed it. The layout is really good and straightforward so there is little backtracking. This is a very worthwhile place to spend some of your time."
,,Birds everywhere,4.0,,"Enjoyed the walking on the lake trail by the flamingo. But unlike other three, here, most of the bird is inside metal cage, which hamper viewing capability. It would be nice, if they are inside glass cage."
,,Awesome Experience,5.0,,Beautiful place to visit if you are bird frantic. Park has Kids wet zone where my daughter had a wonderful time. Have a lot of variety of beautiful birds and have good shows.
,,Must Visit - Both for kids and adults,4.0,,This is by far the best bird park i have ever seen nor have I seen so many different species of birds. It is a very well maintained park. You even get opportunity to click a photograph with the parrot sitting on your hand. You...More

,,Stunning Birds in a beautiful setting,5.0,,I hadn't been to the Jurong Bird Park for 20 years and was keen to see whether it was even better than last time. And I am pleased to say it was. Hornbills and Toucans are a highlight. Birds of Paradise were stunning. Lots of...More

,,It's for the birds - and the people!,5.0,,"A must-see for birders of any stripe who visit Singapore – well worth the ride on the MRT and a connecting bus.

,,A lovely park,4.0,,This is a lovely park with amazing birds. Take advantage of the land train to hop on and off at different parts of the park as it is very hot. We went by subway train and a bus and it took one and a quarter...More
,,Terrific in spite of rain,5.0,,"After the zoo and night safari, we were quite looking forward to the bird park and it rained non stop the next day
The outdoor enclosures were rather empty because of the birds cozying up in a corner.
Lori loft was awesome, but the best experience of the day was feeding pelicans. Rain abated for a while and they could do a bird show. That was quite awesome too.
Trams in all of these wildlife parks are lifesavers on rainy days. Well done guys"
,,Amazing place,5.0,,Beautiful place. Very well maintained. Just loved the shows there. One should spend at the least 4 to 5 hrs in jurong park. There is a nice tram but people who like to see more can take a walk inside.
,,Nice place to see all species of birds,4.0,,"I believe Jurong Bird Park has changed alot since my last visit was decades ago. It is definitely a fun place to bring the kids around, rather than letting them glued to the ipads and handphones. A nice place for family bonding as well."
,,Birds of different feathers flock together,4.0,,"One of Singapore’s major wildlife parks, the Jurong Bird Park is a must-see if you’re at all fond of bird life. Set across many acres of well-wooded landscape, with lots of towering trees, water bodies and aviaries of different types and sizes, the bird park gives you a real bird’s eye view of the world’s avifauna. A road (flanked on both sides by beautiful heliconia shrubs with vivid red and yellow flowers) marks the route right through the park, and trams travel along these, stopping at designated tram stops along the way to allow hop-on hop-off travel. There are secondary pathways that you can traverse only on foot.

Among the most intriguing and spectacular sections we saw were the ones that allow visitors to get up close to the birds: the aviaries where you walk right in. The raptors, hornbills, toucans, birds of paradise, parrots, etc are all in cages (all very large, rest assured), but the pelicans and the flamingoes are out in the open on lakes, and two massive aviaries—the Lory Loft (which houses about a thousand lorikeets) and the Waterfall Aviary (the highlight of which is a 35 mt high waterfall)—allow you to really cross paths with some lovely birds. We oohed and aahed over gorgeous crowned pigeons, brilliantly coloured finches, parrots, macaws, peafowl, and more, watched them feeding just an arm’s length away, and got a chance to see many species we’d never even heard about before.

One of the most informative sections is the Bird Discovery Centre, a small and compact space that, across a handful of rooms, uses text, pictures, stuffed specimens and more to explain birds: their beaks, their bodies, their feeding and reproduction, human inventions inspired by birds, and more.

There is also a children’s play area that is bird-themed (we couldn’t visit this because, due to some corporate function, the park shut early on the day we visited). There are also various souvenir shops, eateries, toilets, etc dotted across the park. Do remember to pick up a park map and brochure (available free at the entrance), which also includes a comprehensive listing of feeding times for different birds—it’s a good way of getting to see them—as well as the timings for different shows at the park.

The only show we were able to go to was the High Flyers one, which showcases some interesting skills—flying/manoeuvring, dexterity, vocal mimicry, etc by an array of birds such as parrots, hornbills, and so on. Our toddler, whose fourth birthday it was in the day we visited, was absolutely thrilled that the parrot on the compere’s wrist actually sang ‘Happy birthday to you’ to all those in the audience (including, of course, our daughter) who were celebrating their birthday on that day. The show ended with a delightful grand finale consisting of dozens of birds of different species waddling into the amphitheatre and filling it with sound and colour.

We loved this place. The only drawback of it being a rainy day (it drizzled throughout, in varying intensity) was that since about 95% of the birds are out in the open (even the aviaries are covered in the top only by mesh), you get wet if you aren’t carrying an umbrella or wearing a raincoat. Either way, taking photos gets a bit difficult."
,,This park is big and fun,5.0,,The 2 best things I did in this park is going to the waterfall while birds flew around me and feeding the parrots in an enclosure that they could fly around in. This is the best Bird park.
,,AbsolutelyFantastic,5.0,,"This place is truly worth the money/journey(unlike the NightSafari..)Spectacular walk through avairies,displays,info.Bird show was well worth it..lacked the usual ""shouty-shouty cheesiness"" and focussed on good info/flight displays..1st time we'd ever got in with Flamingoes and entire park is a pleasure to walk around-especially good for families with kids"
,,Enjoyable coupe of hours with some good shows,4.0,,"Time your visit to be there early morning, so you can finish with the 11am bird tour. That way you can avoid the hottest part of the day. Lots of birds on display, with some fun areas where you can get real close to the birds."
,,Interesting visit.,3.0,,"Quite a trek by public transport,a metro and a short bus ride.
There are some interesting and beautiful species there, some were hidden in a lot of foliage so we couldn't see them. There is a lot to see.There are various bird shows and enough to keep you amused. We particularly enjoyed the visit to the parrot enclosure.Sadly we didn't have much time, so it was a whirlwind visit."
,,Famous Bird Park !,4.0,,"Singapore's very own famous bird park. This has evolved over the years and is a great visit for kids and the old alike. Lots of interaction with the birds in different ways - feeding, shows etc."
,,Worth it!!,5.0,,My husband and I spent a couple of hours visiting the bird park and we loved it. Great spot for people of all ages. Do not miss if you are visiting Singapore.
,,Flying amazement,5.0,,"This was the first bird park experience, and what a fantastic park it is... Birds of all sizes in one giant park kept so very well. The Bird show is amazing experiences with fantastic management of different species of birds and the involvement of viewers in the show by the organizers is worth every penny. The self feeding of birds in Lory loft is also a great experiences. The Penguins kept in their natural environment is also worth visiting. The park is very kids and senior citizens friendly. Strongly recommended for Singapore visitors."
,,See it before its gone,5.0,,"The park have special theme for Singapore school holidays in corporation with its new macaws habitat. Fun at Lorry Loft never where adults and kids are challenged each other to see who feeds the most birds. Great bird show, look out for the mascot station at photo shot spot for you to snap. All time favorite at the will be the cute penguins."
,,wonderful collection of birds,5.0,,different variety of bird species you will find here in jurong bird park main attraction was to feed birds there & also different types of birds shows
,,wonderful park,4.0,,This is a must visit attraction while in singapore.There are a large no of different birds in their natural environment.Tram is easily available for those who are not able to walk and it stops at 3-4 stations from where one can see the enclosures.Hornbills were particularly beautiful.
,,Bird Park,5.0,,"Good shows demonstrating the intelligence of the birds, nice photo ops and tram ride around the place.Good educational value for children"
,,Love birds? Got to go here!,4.0,,"Asia’s largest bird park houses 5,000 birds across 400 species. Many of them roam free as we saw birds that were not in their designated signed enclosures. It was sad to see large Birds of Prey in wired cages too small for them but otherwise; it is a well thought out Bird Park. Our favorite was the Waterfall Aviary where we watched a Taveta Golden Weaver painstakingly construct his nest out of foliage and twigs. Another fun bird to watch was the Common Crowned Pigeon who didn’t mind us being within a foot of it to take pictures. We could have stayed all day. Make sure to put on bug spray before you go!

Take the East-West MRT line bound for Tuas Link, and alight at Boon Lay (EW27). From the Boon Lay bus interchange, take Bus No. 194, which will take you straight to Jurong Bird Park."
,,unexpected,5.0,,had not read any reviews but suggested it as my wife is a bird lover The park was laid out beautifully the assortment of birds was great. Some of the enclosures for the larger birds seemed small for such large birds.
,,"Very pretty place, lots of birds",4.0,,"I wojuld rather have gone to the zoo, but we ended up here on a very hot day and thank goodness for the little train that drives you around because I was too hot to wak. Everything is well laid out and organized in sections according to bird type. The colourful birds are lovely, the flamingoes too. I enjoyed seeing the little penguins diving and swimming. It doesn't take that long to cover the area, maybe an hour. There are facilitites there too for eating and shopping (of course.) I think the price is a little steep for entry."
,,Dinosaur descendants,4.0,,"I was helping out at a One Community Fiesta event as first aiders and took the opportunity to walk around the Bird Park to have another appreciation of the Park before it moved to Mandai in 2020. This was not the first time I came to this Bird Park. The last two occasions we were fascinated by the bird shows but this time I just walked around quickly to have a glimpse if there is anything different. Frankly speaking, I don;t really have much interest in aviary species and even if they appeared very colorful to me, I don't really will read more about it.

But I was surprised to see one section of the park labeled as `Dinosaur Descendants' and include such birds like Emu, ostrich, etc. How does dinosaurs evolved into birds? How does feathers and wings formed in dinosaurs? I was curious and started reading up on this area and found that evidence were found in fossils linking similar bone structure between one type of dinosaurs and birds. Similarity was also found in the evolution of the skull. I really could not believe this theory. But scientists are talking about evolution over millions of years and I thought of Darwin and the evolution of man from apes.

As I returned to the main hall of activities and looking out from the glass door, I could see the stunning view of the many beautiful and colorful flamingos playing in the lake. But deep in my mind, I still wondered if these meek and slender flamingos could have evolved from dinosaurs.

It is thought provoking this time to visit the Jurong Bird Park and strongly suggest you visit the park before it moved to Mandai in 2020. ."
,,A place for Bird and Nature Lovers...,4.0,,This place is ideal for the Bird Lovers. And there is an spectacular Bird Show at the Amphitheater (Check their websites for the show times). This is little bit far from the city center so better go there early. Tickets for Singapore Zoo also can buy at this place to avoid queues if you plan to go there after the Bird Park. (I prefer 1st visit to Bird park and then to Zoo as the Night Safari should not be missed at the Zoo. Anyway there is a plan to merge the Jurong Bird park with the Zoo in future...
,,Amazing hands on experience for kids!,5.0,,"We especially love the Lory loft where our kids could feed the birds and the see the bird up close.

We also love how the Bird Park values conservation of wildlife seriously. It was evident through their live shows and also areas around the Bird Park."
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"Shows are great, disappointed with Sky hawk show. Need to get some more wild birds. Time well spent."
,,The best bird park ever visited,5.0,,"It was drizzling when we received the bird park at Singapore, but it was great to see that the birds were not captivated and roaming around freely in the natural way. The bird show is the best.Kudos to the trainers. Absolutely loved the place. My kid, parents and grand parents had a gala time."
,,Memorable visit,5.0,,This is definitely one of the top attractions of Singapore. The bird park has so much diversity in the birds they have. I remember going for the parrot and the vulture shows. It was amazing
,,Good visit,4.0,,"Of all the zoo parks I enjoyed this one the most - the show was good. some areas of the park are starting to look a bit tired but they are moving the park to be beside the zoo, that is due to open in couple of years."

,,Worth it!,4.0,,All the shows are really good and entertaining. Very nice use of space with lots of plants and greenery which keeps the park relatively cool. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. The concept of having a bird show at the buffet restaurant is a good one. Lucky for us it wasn’t crowded at all.

,,Great Park with Colors - Must Visit,5.0,,"This is simply a great park with some excellent birds. One gets to understand that there can be so many varieties of parrots with colors one will find it hard to imagine. The special attraction is the blue macaws that is truly fascinating.

You can see more place if you go by walk"
,,Kids Loved it,4.0,,Loved the bird park . Enjoyed the shows ... Most enjoyable was Penguin feeding ....It was my second visit since I last visited in 2004... Changed a bit but shows looked pretty the same .. Food & drinks availability was better ... Kids loved the small water play area
,,Worth a visit if you are nearby,4.0,,"A nice place to visit, although if you cannot walk long distance, suggest you take the tram, as there is plenty of uphill trek. Wide range of birds, dont miss the bird show. Only setback is it is rather far from town (45min - 1hour)"
,,Buy the 4 park package,5.0,,"Like most things in Singapore, it's beautiful but expensive. 4 Park pckg seems like best deal. Be sure to visit the area where you can feed the birds, great fun."
,,really nice,4.0,,"the only problem was it being away from the other 3 safaris but it was a good park lots of variety.by next year authorities will shift it closer so good.
our kids loved the option of clicking snaps with the birds close to them.

,,One of the good places to be,5.0,,"Very nice birds around a lot of them in open, Can feed them and they stay near you. Lots and Lots of Birds All shows should be attended and 2 days can be used instead of going to the Zoo spend time here very nicely trained birds."
,,Exceeded my expectations!,5.0,,"I bought tickets for this attraction and I was expecting something to be enjoyed by children only. To my surprise my wife and I ended up enjoying it as well. The bird park is very well mantained and the animals on display are amazing. We paid some extra to use the tram and it took us all over the park with four stations to hop on and hop off.
Great experience!"
,,Lovely place for kids,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a must watch for any bird lover and even if you are not a bird lover you will stil love the experience of visiting this place .. in urbanised Singapore, this is one of the many places where you can feel close to nature.. the place is beautifully maintained and they have a huge variety of birds and Engage people with a lot of activities

The place is a mus visit for at least Kids ad they would really love the activities and shows that they do out there

The food at the restaurant was also quite good event though slightly on the higher side"
,,Fantastic variety of wildlife.,4.0,,"The bird park was fantastic., with birds not only from Singapore but other parts of the world.
There are many opportunities to photograph colourful bird, if fact all birds.
They have a bird display at the coffee shop where birds preform various tasks, they had three different colored Macaws which made great photos.
For some reason it was much cooler in the bird park, a relief from the hot sun.
There were also mobility scooters if you are not to good on your feet.
It was a great experience and I would love to go back"
,,Bird paradise,4.0,,"Beautiful greenery teeming with the chirping of birds. The bird park with its shows and little tram was simply refreshing. We did it on our last day in Singapore and Jurong lived up to its expectations. The lory loft, birds of paradise, the waterfall aviary, the flamingoes were all exceptional. Neat well maintained place."
,,Look see feel natural wonder,4.0,,Amazing collection of birds Build so close to reality Fantastic animals show Never miss it for children Strongly recommend for 5 to 7 hours or full day to enjoy it
,,great activity with the family,4.0,,A super way to spend time with family and kids. Watch the shows and try to be there during the feeding times.
,,A must-see place during morning hours,5.0,,"The tram ride can be avoided as the entire place can be covered by walking. There are various bird shows starting from 10am. These are very impressive. Being an open area, advise to visit the place in the morning, may be by 9:30am onwards, to avoid the heat of the sun."
,,Great day out with kids.,5.0,,"Thoroughly enjoyable with some stunningly beautiful birds. There is a separate enclosure/area for parrots, so many different kinds. Other indoor enclosures are exceptional as it's likely you will be very close to Squirrels, monkeys and even lemurs. We loved this park. Lovers of birds and wildlife don't miss it!!!"
,,Amazing collection of birds!,5.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is well worth visiting. It's very easy to get there on the East / West Green MRT line headed west. Get off at Boon Lay, walk into and through the shopping Centre to the bus Interchange and get on the 194 Bus. Get off at the first stop and you're there. We spent a very happy 3 hours at the park wandering around and being amazed by the birds. Like everything in Singapore very well organized, clean and tidy - the birds appeared to be very well looked after and the big aviaries are amazing allowing them to fly freely. Well worth going to."
,,Spectacular birds,4.0,,The birds the greenery and the bird shows at Jurong bird park were great the kids just loved them. The special samba brazilian dance was an added bonus on the 31st of december when we visited .The tram rides and the photo shoot with the birds made it a special memory indeed!
,,exotic birds,5.0,,rare experience of seeing birds from all flocks. well maintained and fed. amazing collection. saw a number of birds which are on the verge of extinction.
,,Great family afternoon out,4.0,,"We had a great time at Jurong Bird Park. There was a huge variety of wildlife to see and the park is clean and well kept. I love the refill water bottle stations, should be more of them in Singapore in general. I was also pleased to see that the 4 parks will all be in close proximity in the near future."
,,Best Bird Park,4.0,,"This is real tropical rainforest with best facilities for tourists. The place is good to go in 1st half of the day and accessible by MRT with complimentary shuttles. Reach by 9:30 so you can enjoy free shows at 10 and 11 am. Also can visit many birds feeding sessions. Kids enjoy. We saw rare blue Macaw( fame of Rio movie) during special fest. The tram is not worth unless of course you have elderly or kids who don't want to walk. The Park can be covered maximum in 3 hours. You get discounts on online booking and various agents even with Singapore airlines but they all include Tram tickets. And Tram has big queues on Station 1, skip that and catch up tram from other stations if you have tickets. Lots of free refill water stations( the best change I saw in Singapore: an effort to reduce single use plastics- KUDOS) and lots of eating options too. Pizza Hut and Indian restaurant"
,,Nice experience but could be improved,3.0,,"Best experience would be the lory Loft attraction.. but somehow I felt that the number of birds in the enclosure has lessened compared to several years ago..

Therefore the ratio of birds to humans are lesser.. with the purchasing of food to feed the birds with the large number of tourists, makes the birds feel overly full.. you hardly have the chance to feed it for more than 10 secs before it gets bored and flew away.. so get your cameras ready!

I suggest the bird park to add more birds into Lory Loft enclosure.. how about the peacock? I didn’t notice it too, previously I do see it.. as a local, I feel this attraction needs to further improve to serve tourists better.."
,,"Love, love, love Jurong Bird Park",5.0,,"I have to confess, we’re bird people (we have a pet miniature macaw). If you’re also a bird person you HAVE to go to Jurong. Even if you don’t have a pet bird, this is a world class facility. It is also quite large, you should plan to spend about half a day +/-. We were staying at the Westin in the financial district, there is public transportation out to the park, but we took Uber both ways (Uber is a great option in Singapore it was under $20 each way and took 20-25 minutes). Highlights are the 11a bird show, the new Parrot Paradise exhibit (largest exhibit of Macaws in Asia including 3 types of rare blue macaws), and the Lorikeets exhibit which is huge and amazing). There were many other great exhibits as well, this is definitely a venue you should consider if traveling to Singapore."
,,Best free flight bird show I've seen,5.0,,First time at jurong bird park and was really impressed with the conservation information on each exhibit. There is also an exhibit where you view the young hatchlings and weaning room. Just brilliant day
,,Dont miss,5.0,,Awesome experience ..... try to book online beforehand and Dont miss Birds shows ....are the best part of whole trip
,,Looking for the future,3.0,,"It was my best place to go, but when I went there just now. The mono-rail has gone. But I'm still looking forward to the extension of the zoo combined with this bird park."
,,Jurong Bird Park,3.0,,"If you have already visited the Zoo & Night safari, you will slightly get bored. Because the infra, atmosphere everything reminds same. So it will be like 3rd time doing same thing. But the birds make you really live. They have such a good collection of birds. Especially parrots, Flamingos are highlights.

But give 2nd or 3rd priority. If you bought 4 parks together passes, then don't miss it. Its worth vising once."
,,Amazing place to hangout and watch variety of birds,5.0,,"With unexpected day off, I started thinking where to spend entire day, since I live west side of Singapore so thought of going to Jurong Bird Park, immediately booked the ticket online and rushed to park, i missed 10 am and 11 am shows of kings of the skies and high flyers show respectively so directly started exploring different areas by taking walk, Jurong bird park is small as compared to Singapore Zoo, but if you are travelling with kids or elders then better to opt for tram or mini train with 5SGD ticket prize, it is hop on hop off service, parents who are with children s with their strollers also can put in to that train very convenient. JBP has many areas to watch, Waterfall Aviary, Lory loft Jungle jewels, Penguin Coast, Flamingo lake, Hornbill & toucan aviary are must visit, each section has brief explaination about birds and it's species. Kids also has waterpark inside, there are plenty of options to eat and drink, since Singapore has tropical weather all the year, unexpected drizzle may occur, also carry hat, and sunglasses from sun (as it may be humid outside) Overall one of the must visit Tourist spot in Singapore."
,,The birds are okay..but walking up and down the slopes is too tiring,3.0,,The kids enjoyed the bird watching..but the adults found it too tiring walking around up and down the slopes since the park is located at the sides of a hill. Taking the tram won't be fun since you will not be able to see the birds (in the cage) up close.
,,Best Singapore Experience,5.0,,"One of my children wanted to go, I wondered how we’d be entertained for the day. We like birds but we’re not big fans. After our visit I’m a fan, it was fantastic!! All the family aged 12-60 really enjoyed it. I highly recommend a visit."
,,Interesting place for bird lovers,5.0,,"Jurong bird park is enjoyable by all, be it a kid or an adult. They have some shows like King of the Skies, Penguin feeding, High Flyers, where they show the skills of different birds.

There is a penguin enclosure which should not be missed.
The tram ride takes you to different sections of the park.
Pizza Hut and other eateries are present inside the park.
Staff is very helpful."
,,Tourists Should Visit. Go in the Morning,5.0,,"Review by DrSim001. Tourists should visit. However, you must like birds or it is a waste of time. Go in the morning when it is cool. Take note of the times of the shows. If you go in the morning, you can see the shows that you missed in morning. Shows are repeated in the afternoon. If it rains, shows are cancelled. Take the tram ride though it costs some money. Bring your own water. Lunch is quite reasonable depending on where you eat. S$15 to S$20 per pax. Regards DrSim001."
,,Worlds Largest Bird Park,5.0,,"Went with family as I have 5 year old boy thought he can enjoy watching birds. Really he enjoyed as he can touch them and watch them from closely. Visit during cloudy day so that you dont need to sweat a lot.
Tram facility is available so that you can use it."
,,Mixed Feelings,3.0,,"Some of the birds are able to roam freely about in lots of open space. Others, on the other hand (especially the parrots) are confined to relative small enclosures. There is a lovely waterfall and you can take a tram ride around the park. The place is pretty in parts but I felt was spoilt by the enclosures. The gift shop sells some cool items that are reasonably priced. There are cafes throughout the park. We ate at one and if you order an Asian dish, the food was good."
,,Love this place!,5.0,,"I love birds anyway and these are terrific! Fantastic shows several times a day to show off the predators, penguins and parrot / hornbills etc. Amazing how well these birds are trained.
The rest of the day you can walk around the exhibits, feed the lorikeets and chat with the keepers.
As you'd expect, there is found and drink for sale and a large souvenir shop.
Park in the car park across the road, don't leave your motorcycle inside the park boundary like me or you'll get clamped too"
,,Good fun,5.0,,"We went there with our young boy who's only 2 years old. We all love it as there are lots of birds to see and the park is so easy to walk around.

Many types of birds around the park and you can also take a train ride there that takes you around with several stops.

We would highly recommend for a visit with kids. We love it even more than the zoo!!"
,,Nice place to see birds,5.0,,"Located at the West side of Singapore, not very accessible though. Lots of varieties of birds to see. Good place to visit for kids."
,,"Very well designed park with beautiful birds, great for families, couples and birdlovers",5.0,,"We went on a Sunday mid-day - afternoon and strolled through this great park where you can experience happy and beautiful birds in a fantastics environment. Also in hot weather it is very enjoyable, particularly the volieres and waterfall area.
Highly recommendable to enjoy some nature within the city and learn about our feathered friends."
,,Great Trip with my son,5.0,,Enjoys the trip with the clear park map provide. Wishing that there have more activities to allow visitor to have nearest touch with the wild life.
,,Bird Park with the Kiddos,4.0,,Nice day at the Bird Park. Wish there was more to see at the Park. The best attraction was definitely the Hawk Arena where they have the birds of preys show.
,,Wonderful Time,5.0,,"The bird park was just a wonderful experience. The park by itself is an habitat for birds and that make it very special to see few birds up close. The water fall avery and the lorry loft where we can feed the birds was one amazing experience for my 2 year old son, my wife and myself."
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"Love the shows provided there. the kids enjoy the waterplay park especially during the hot weather. sadly, I find it hard to find halal food. The only available option is pizza hut. Perhaps the park can consider having more halal food options"
,,Must visit,5.0,,"You can enjoy the shows.. They are really awesome.. Large collections of birds.. We enjoyed all shows, feeding birds, snaps with birds.. Must visit in Singapore."
,,Always Delightful to be Back,5.0,,"Been ages since I went to the bird park again. The park now has tram rides and features five sections of bird sanctuary, personally find the one on the penguin very interesting as it features some of the birds that are not found in Singapore. The waterfall area is really nice , with the cool natural surrounding, and lush greenery it is definitely worth spending time there. There are 2 shows at the bird park now, one is featuring a vast array of bird and their other on eagles and vultures. Be sure to double check on their show times before going. Locals get special rates and if you are senior citizen remember to show your SR card. Passion Card and NTUC card members also get special rates and rebates too."
,,Lovely quiet and serene,5.0,,I lived my visit here it is lovely quiet and serene. the bird are beautiful and the exhibits very good. Toasted sandwich at the coffee shop was a stand out. Grab the MRT to Boon Lay and the Bus from the Boon Lay interchange there it is only a few stops and a nice journey.
,,Nice but can be skipped,4.0,,"If you planning to visit Singapore Zoo or have been to bird sanctuaries elsewhere, you can skip this. We took the inside tram as we were short on time, birds are in excellent conditions. Loved the kiwis. You can bring your food. Water fountains and clean washrooms everywhere. Kids play area is cool so don't forget to pack their swim wear. Their Photo booth is a money rip off. Unlike the Chimelong Safari Park in Guangzhou you can't really touch birds."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Well its far, but its quite good! Do not miss the Bird shows they are quite interesting. Carry your umbrella along as it gets hot during afternoon!"
,,Better than the zoo,5.0,,My son loves birds so this place was always going to be a hit. Be prepared for a full day as this is one of the largest bird parks in the world. It's well designed with heaps to do. The bird show was amazing. I think this place is better than Singapore Zoo.
,,Nice day out with kids,4.0,,"Nice day out with the family. When you arrive, start by taking the trolley around the whole park to figure out what you want to see, and then walk to those places. Distances are short and signs are good, so it's easy to find your way around.

Don't forget to feed the adorable Lori parrots."
,,nice day if you like birds,4.0,,"great day for bird lovers. really great seeing the blue macaws. we bought the team ticket for around the park but it's not really worth it. just walk and check out all the exhibits.
it was a bit of a trek to get there on public transport. we ended up getting an uber home for about $20."
,,Birthday Celebration,3.0,,"It is a memorable celebration for the birthday boy, as well as an educational tour for the children. Food served was not fantastic though."
,,Must visit bird park for all ages!,4.0,,"Went here with my family. They have some amazing collection of birds from all around the globe.
Booked combined package from the official website with Singapore zoo and River safari tickets which turned out to be a good deal for us.
Park is slightly away from Chinatown downtown where we were staying (about 40 minute drive by cab)
Takes approximately 4 hours at least to cover the entire zone. Also they have amazing bird shows which are interesting and must watch. Apart from this there is also option to feed birds and penguins if you want.

Overall a nice place for family outing!"
,,Beautiful place to visit,5.0,,"We went there on 16 dec 2017. The birds were beautiful. The place was clean. Tap water was everywhere. Just a little hot day. The train was always available. But you need to buy the round trip ticket.
Certainly a good place for children to appreciate GOD's creation."
,,Great but expected more,4.0,,"The place is a bit overrated. Not saying it's bad but it does not live up-to the amount of publicity it gets. There are different types of birds from all around the world, which is not very unique as it is a common feature in most bird sanctuaries. The live shows have a very odd timing so it is not possible to catch all of them. Rest is good. If you have some spare time, do visit it. It won't disappoint you."
,,Exotic bird park,5.0,,"What a lovely park that houses a huge variety of beautiful birds...must see when visiting Singapore. My daughter loved it n so did we. Watch them, feed them n capture them in your memories forever"
,,It is a little to hyped place!! Not so great!,3.0,,We were 4 adults and 2 children visited this October'17 here. I had very high expectations from this place thinking this is a specialized Bird Park in Singapore. But my expectations let down I feel. This is hyped place and not worth the entry tickets being charged. There are lot of birds here but surely not worth the price.
,,Must see place in Singapore,5.0,,We visited Jurong bird park this summer. Kids loved it. The best in the whole world. Loved the colorful birds. Kids got a chance to feed the birds. That was very memorable. Highly recommended to adults and definitely kids. Go for it.
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is an excellent place to look at and study birds. It is lusciously green, very well grown and is an excellent place to chill out in the concrete of the city. I would recommend it for nature lovers as well as for those not so accustomed to nature so that they will learn to love nature too."
,,Experiencing as a bird keeper,5.0,,"The whole program was well organised, my Daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The experiences learnt during the program was educating and hands on. Kudos to the team that has made the whole program enjoyable"
,,Nice Ambience,5.0,,Kids love it. Entered from 2pm to close to 6pm. Enjoyed the shows. Should’ve come earlier to enjoy comprehensively.
,,Not many bird to see now,3.0,,Need more entertainment. More beautiful birds. Places to view. Not at the hill. Convenient for everyone to enjoy walking and watching the birds.
,,Amazing exotic birds & enthralling show,5.0,,"Located out of city area, a good place to have a relaxed day with colourful exotic birds. The show was amazing with well-trained avian friend displaying remarkable abilities to please the crowds. A good place for kids."
,,Water park is renovating,4.0,,Brought kids there in hope of some water play but it was under renovation. Should be informed and refund should be made.
,,Quite good...a few let downs,3.0,,"This park was rated as amazing on handy and trio advisor however a few things let us down. Even though I'd pre purchased tickets it took 15 mins to get them verified and us to get let in. Very wierd ..

The park is nice and veryyyy long to walk I feel that there wasn't enough birds let out loose to interact with as there could have been... most birds were caged...

The biggest let down was the water park it was down for repairs.. it was what we were really looking forward to for our baby on that hot day. They could have mentioned it! We would have come back on a day it was open..

The birds are beautiful and worth a visit if you get tickets off HANDY I wouldn't pay full price for this...

Definitely take photos with the gorgous biting bird and do the forest walk... really nice"
,,Flamingo paradise,4.0,,"A wide variety of birdlife, the flamingoes were the highlight for me, three species on site. The trai ed parrots were a popular spectacle."
,,My happy place,5.0,,Jurong Bird Park is simply awesome. It is colorful and entertaining. The shows are brilliant. The feathered are absolutely amazing!
,,Great place to take the kids,5.0,,Can spend at least half a day or even a full day in the park. amazing birds from all over the world. Entertained shows and in the end of the park there is a free water park for the kids which has a great benefit after sweating. Highly recommended!!
,,Not too much to see,3.0,,"From an average visitor perspective, I think it is not as many things to see as zoo. From my personal view, I enjoy it."
,,just a short visit with kids below 2,4.0,,"We only managed to cover a tram ride from main gate to the 4th station and walk back to main gate for exit as kids were getting tired. From 4th station, we visited the parrot area and saw some pelicans and storks on the way with our rented wagon. We also had lunch at the buffet place which has ""lunch with parrot"" show (2pm) which is quite enjoyable for older kids. Buffet spread was fine but not great. SGD25/adult. Overall quite a nice place to visit."
,,New exhibits new experience,4.0,,"Its been a few years since my last trip to the Jurong Bird Park.
There has been some new exhibits such as the blue macaws.
My family and I like the close interractions with some of the birds especially the lory.
The waterfall Aviary has more birds roaming around too."
,,"Over priced in entrance fee, food",1.0,,"Over priced in entrance fee, food. Not worth the money. You should consider a lower entrance fee. Way too expensive!"
,,Perfect,5.0,,Very entertaining but unfortunately only have two attraction and location easy to reach by mrt n bus
,,Jurong bird park visit,3.0,,Glad to have annual ticket promotion going on for just 1 day ticket. My child 9 months was very entertained with the live bird shows. Downside was that some animal spaces were not maintained very well. Flamingos had a foul smell and penguins viewing glass had a lot of poop stains.
,,Social,4.0,,"Impressive and much has changed since last visit 10 years ago. New renovation and landscape,live show was quite stunning."
,,Beautiful experience,5.0,,I loved it. Beautiful. Well taken care park. Personal experience with the birds. Birds are active and well cared for. Spacious for the birds. Amazing landscape. Just nice to walk on the park. Will definitely go again for another walk.
,,Whole world birds come to 1 place,5.0,,Birds birds every where. With so much different species of parrots under one roof. Bird part is huge.You will get tired so take tram ride & enjoy.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"It was amazing, please spend a fukl dayso that you would not miss any show and you can read all the things and take photographs as well"
,,Nice exhibits,4.0,,Interesting exhibits esp on the blue macaws but not sure why owls exhibit was no longer around. Highly recommended for kids!
,,A great day out,5.0,,"I didn’t expect much from the Jurong Bird Park, as we have been to many zoos and didn’t find any of the bird sections very amusing. But this place blew me away.

We took the tram to go to around the park, which was not necessary as the park is fairly small and can be easily covered on foot. Parrot Paradise is the first stop and is absolutely awesome. It houses the largest parrot collection in Asia. I have never seen so many colorful parrots in my life and have never been so close to those beautiful creatures. My son went in with a juice bottle bought from the bird park and a little parrot flew straight onto the bottle and tried to get the juice out. So we ended up with quite a few hilarious pictures.

The bird shows are a must-see, especially the High Flyer Show in the Pools Amphitheatre. It is packed with amazing performances and the interaction with audiences is excellent. One of the parrots can sing and count in different languages, totally unbelievable!

The children’s water playground is my son’s favorite. If we lived nearby, he would definitely want to buy an annual pass and come every day. Next to the playground is a restaurant with a room, where parents can have a break when the kids having fun in the water park. The water playground has safe guards on duty, therefore is very safe.

The only issue I had with the bird park was the demonstration times announced on the tram and displayed on the posters along the road did not match. It was confusing and we missed a pelican feeding session because of that. I think there must be timetables for daily shows/demonstrations at the ticket office, but we were not given any.

If you also plan to visit other zoo(s) in Singapore, it will be much cheaper to buy combined online tickets."
,,A day with the birds,4.0,,"We were early at the bird park a few minutes after it opened and that allowed us more time to view the birds and take photos without having people crowding around. Weather was humid as usual but overall, the walk was enjoyable. The variety of birds are limited though and many facilities such as cafe, children play area were not open despite it being a Sunday."
,,A well spent afternoon.,5.0,,"The shows were really good and it was an interesting outing with little children. There are Pizza Hut and KFC inside too, so kids do not have to worry about getting hungry. Safety was also looked by staff for childen playing in the wet pool."
,,"If you like birds, this is a great place to visit",5.0,,"I had a great time at the Jurong Bird Park. There are tons of birds to see and two verry good shows with free flying birds of all sorts. There are also scheduled feedings and times where you can interact with some of the birds.

It’s Singapore and the park is almost completely outside so it can get hot, steam, and rainy. To help stay cool the park is shaded with trees and there are fans placed at strategic locations. If that doesn’t work there are also some exhibits /areas which are in air-conditioned zones. For example, the artic penguin viewing area is air conditioned and so is the breeding center.

If you take your time and try to see all the shows and feedings you can easily spend 5+ at the park.

Don’t miss the Lory Loft; a large aviary featuring Lories and Lorikeets. You can purchase a fairly large cup of nectar that the birds will come down and feed on; often during this feeding they will landing on your hands, arms shoulders, etc. It only costs $3 Singapore dollars which is a much better deal than the tiny amount I got at a similar attraction in the US for $5 USD.

You can supposedly get to the bird park via the mrt and a bus but coming from downtown that will take at least an hour. It is far easier to get a taxi which will cost $15-$20 USD and take about 25 minutes. There is a queue for taxis at the entrance but they do not come very regularly; it would be best to call up a cab or an Uber if you don’t want to wait forever."
,,Too Far.. & Best for Bird Lovers,3.0,,Been there but i didn't enjoyed here much as i find the place little boring for people who are not into birds .. Its a must for birds who want to capture photos of them Like i saw many wildlife photographers there clicking pictures.. it's to far away from the city
,,Birds for Real,4.0,,You can see different species of birds and enjoy a wonderful show. Click a lot of pictures. Its well maintained with eateries so no issue of food.
,,amazing,5.0,,words will be less to describe the experience... do not MISS out .... any shows or lorry feeding... kids loves it
,,water play area,3.0,,"There should be clearer signs to direct people to the area where penguins are being fed. Many were misled to the penguins venue and waited for over 15mins only to realise we had missed the feeding outside. The bird show was great and the children enjoyed it. It was disappointing when we realised the water play area was closed. Would be great if this was highlighted in the website homepage or at entrance so that we could manage our children's expectations. The bird park rangers were friendly and helpful, making the experience pleasant. Thank you."
,,JUST WOW ...,5.0,,What variety of birds ... Amazing . Though quite on the outskirts of the city it was fun .. we travelled by MRT and then a bus to reach there from the city .. It was a part of our package .. Amazing variety of birds right in front of you .. Never seen experience .. Would like to visit there once more as we had to cut short our trip to catch our flight .. Next Vsit this is the first i am gonna do
,,"enjoyed, family friendly, amazing park",5.0,,"the park is very good. get down at Boon Lay MRT station and find a bus that goes to Jurong Bird Park. you can find bus number from ""singa bus"" app. in the bird park you get wheelchair for free and baby stroller on rent of approx. 9SGD. Pools amphitheatre is a very nice show. family enjoyed it very much. dont forget to get a tram ticket while buying tickets for bird park. tram ride is good. ""lory loft"" near tram station 2 in the bird park is awesome where you even get chance to feed the birds and get good photographs (oh not to forget to turn off the flash of camera). waterfall aviary near tram station 3 is also a good sight to see and enjoy. overall value for money and worth watching everything even the penguins. buy park hopper tickets from wrs official site which I found cheaper than usual other sites if u going for 2 or more parks visit."
,,Colourful but large birds caged,3.0,,"This was an attractive park to visit with plenty of varied birds to see. You can take a tram around the site to get your bearings as it is a lot of walking. The thing I didn't like was seeing the larger birds in small cages.
There are places to eat and good signage. Do drink plenty of water."
,,A Visit To Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,Educational especially for young children. Even the adults gained knowledge on the various Kids enjoy the close encounter with the birds
,,😊,5.0,,It was an wonderful experience and we spend almost the whole day in jurong bird park. Sooner we will visit again...😊
,,Jurong Bird Park with young kids,4.0,,"Overall it’s very good and the park has quite a variety of birds. However, during our visit last Saturday, my toddler daughter was very disappointed that the ostrich wasn’t there (I think the place has been replaced by a stork, next to the cassowary).

It could also be better if there are more sheltered seats along the way."
,,Family fun,5.0,,This place is a classic. What can I say. Pretty straight forward attraction in Singapore Lots of variety of birds and for family fun.
,,Pretty good,3.0,,"The trip was enjoyable overall. Many different species of birds and the layout of the Park made it easy to move around and accessible. Staff were friendly and approachable. Only downsides were that there arent many places to eat inside, only a small cafe kind of thing at the lory loft, the rest we could find were stalls. Let’s be honest, the stalls are overpriced. We also had brought park hopper tickets to go to night safari after, so the tickets in my inbox were in the order of BP,NS,BP,NS etc. Instead of scanning all the bird park tickets, he just scanned the first 5, which included a few of our night safari tickets. When I asked him, he just waved me off and said it didn’t matter. Well it did, we got held up by the night safari staff who couldn’t understand what we were saying and ended being late to one of the shows, missing the whole thing pretty much. But besides that, would recommend again."
,,A pleasant outing with a large collection of birds,4.0,,"We visited the Jurong Bird Park a year ago - it was a very pleasant outing with large aviaries for birds we do not see in Europe.

The park is well kept and laid out. The birds seem well fed and contented with their spaces. However, we did not enjoyed the parrots aviaries section which seemed toosmall and the birds seemed to try to escape by pecking at the cages.

The flamingos and pelicans seemed happy and had large areas to roam about.

Jurong Park is a good place to visit if you stay in Singapore for a while."
,,Awesome Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a must when u come to Singapore. Easy to go when u take a bus. Excellent birds performance, breath taking sight view and kindly instructors, if u go, u will not be regrated, believe me."
,,"Entire area looks a bit tired, Poor customer service. ,",2.0,,"Paid $100+ for 2 adults, 1child & 2 Snrs and it didn’t felt worth it.

1. Kids were there for the water play area and it was closed for maintenance. No mention when I bought the tickets online, or at least not visible to me. Would not have booked this date.
2. Went for parrot & Lory feeding and had photos taken. The person kept asking me to buy the photos. First said $35 for one. And when rejected, he lowered to 2 for $50. And when further rejected, he said 5 for $50. What is the actual price?? My dad did buy finally but That’s not the kind of attitude I expect of a kids attraction at SG. If u want to build memories, take the pictures of happy guests who love nature and animals, post them on your Facebook and not just think of making quick bucks.

3. Food selection was very limited. Apart from hawk cafe outside (ridiculous pricing) there’s nothing much inside. At least zoo had kfc near the kids play area where parents & kids could grab a seat/ quick bite.

Birds selection was good and they were pretty but it was a waste that we had to head out of JBP for decent lunch and were not inclined to head back after that."
,,Kids Paradise,5.0,,Your kids would surely love this place. To see and feel nature and bird life so close is an amazing experience
,,HOW DO THEY DO IT ? WORTH A WATCH,5.0,,Excellent shows and a well kept bird park. The two shows are a must see for all the tourists. It was exhilarating experience for our family. Great
,,Well-Maintained & Well-Organised Bird Park,5.0,,The Jurong Bird Park is definitely impressive. It is so well maintained and well organised. This bird park is home to many bird species and possibly the largest bird park in Asia. You will be amazed and not be disappointed when you visit this bird park. It is a world class bird park for sure.
,,Beautiful bird park,5.0,,"Generally loved this place full of beautiful birds. The bird show was great - not the sort of thing I go for usually I prefer wild birds but a lot of birds are rescues and their conservation work & breeding endangered species great. I walked around be warned it’s huge - I was a sweaty mess when finally done ( sorry but true). The only thing that made me sad was some huge eagles in a big cage but not big enough for these eagles - I think they are rescue birds I would like to see them in a bigger cage or free but I’m sure unfortunately this is not possible & Jurong doing their best for them.
I got the MRT out there - it’s is the furthest reaches of central ‘tourist’ Singapore but I really enjoyed seeing a different side to the island - where it’s citizens live. The stop nearest to the park ( sorry can’t remember name) ends in a shopping centre on right go through & follow signs heading again right you will come eventually to a taxi rank. Jurong bird park is a shirt taxi ride from there ."
,,Fun time,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is home to numerous birds of the world. It is Asia’s largest bird park with a collection of more than 380 species. 

The open concept Flamingo Lake is another must-see where hundreds of greater and lesser flamingos strut around one of the most picturesque sights in the Park.

Opening Time is 08:30 AM and closing time is 06:30 PM.

The best way to come to the park is through the East West Line (MRT) till Noon Lay and then change over to Bus No. 194 from Boon Lay to Jurong Bird Park."
,,BIRDY'S WORLD,5.0,,"Colorful , well trained several Birds make this park. Only worry is dry .Lots of varieties of birds flying around creates the aura ."
,,"Great park, but staff member was rude",2.0,,"The park was a great experience, great shows, nice features, however, we had one bad experience. Near the entrance, visitors can take pictures with parrots and some other birds. The staff member who organizes the photos (Rachel), was literally yelling at my parents because they missed an instruction. My parents aren't native english speakers so they had a bit of trouble understanding what she was saying, but getting yelled at was absolutely not warranted. I hope the staff behavior can improve in the future."
,,As good as the zoo but more original,5.0,,"I have been going there every year the past 6 years and it is the kids who remember to go, why? No crowd, unique shows with eagle, owl, vulture, talking parrot etc. Suggestions: go earlier 8:30am+ to avoid sunny day: at 12:00 you can have munch at the entrance. You can avoid the path on the extreme left the best is on top/middle/right."
,,some of part being closed n damage,3.0,,especially wet zone where the kid is playing but some of wet zone like drainage n floor is a bit disappointed ovarall 👋
,,Bird Paradise,5.0,,"Experience :-

Where Colour Lives - is the tagline of the Jurong Bird Park which I also found to be the most fitting. The many colours (of Birds, it is as though someone higher up in the nature splash a can of paint over them) that you are about to come across will bound to induce visual excitements. Also, are you a self proclaimed bird specialist and think you know that many different species? You might have to re-think again.

It's a shame on me, as a Local that my last visit specifically to Jurong Bird Park was probably more than a good decade ago on a school excursion - my impression of here has always been a small, uninteresting park; but that totally changes today. I truly enjoyed the good mixture of open enclosures that allow one to get up-and-personal with the birds when they can afford it. I do understand the rationale of some species/hostile types that have to caged in though I hope that some of them can be converted to partially glass to allow better visual and observations.

As always, I really appreciate the prominent messages across the Parks that help to create an environmental awareness and Human's actions that can have an implication on the Animals. I have also heard the Bird Park will soon be shifting to Mandai area alongside with her siblings (the Zoo and Safari's) and I hope this move and the accessibility that follow, may allows more visitors to come visit in her new reborn Glory.

Tips/Advice:-

1) Preparations : Especially those with kiddos, Anti-Mozzie is highest priority. Some of the indoor enclosure were literally filled with mosquito (I counted 30+ bites on mine :() and the wet weather of late definitely did not help. Wear comfortably (shoes and clothes) and also study the weather precipitation beforehand.

2) Preferred Time of Visiting? Having visited on a Weekend, i think the crowd is manageable on Weekday as well as Weekend; if you have a choice, do visit early on a Weekday to have the park all to yourself

3) Admission Fee? Its $29 for adult, $19 for child and usually some discounts will apply when you buy via Online for Locals. One should definitely consider the multi-Parks special (check out the ParkHopper Special) to enjoy a decent discount

4) Location : it be best to take Bus, either transferring from the Zoo (which the Bus cost about $4-6) if you are Park Hopping or taking 194 from Boon Lay Bus Interchange (Boon Lay MRT on the Green line)

Suggestion for the Park's Management:

1) As part of the Park Hopper bundle and experience, maybe you can look into covering the costs of transports between Zoo/River-Night Safari to the Jurong Bird Park which as of now cost between $4-6. I do think the cost of transport is marginal as compared to driving the crowd flow to visit Jurong Bird Park too, which is currently awkwardly situated away from the 3 other parks. I believe the gesture of waiving the Transports cost to Jurong Bird Park will for 1) boost traffic heading to Bird Park due to the ease and cost of transferring and 2) encourage people to buy 4-parks Park Hopper bundle.

As always, please refer to my Photos for visual and thank you for reading."
,,Superb,5.0,,Just superb! So nice maintenance Such a variety of birds Mesmerising shows Wonderful tram service 5 to 6 hrs required.
,,Awesome,4.0,,"Truly a worthwhile visit, although I would not recommend any additional expenditure such as bird feeding. King of the skies and other events held across the day in park premises and feeding sessions with penguins are a must attend."
,,Vast and enjoyable place for whole day,5.0,,It's a very vast place with lots of varieties of birds. I would recommend taking the Tram to reach different stops since they are bit far in between compared to the Zoo. You can probably plan Jurong Bird Park and the Science Center for one whole day. Transport recommendation would be to reach Jurong East MRT and take 194 from Jurong East Interchange which takes you direct to the Bird Park. There are good eating options as well in the park.
,,Tryst with our winged friends,5.0,,"An excellent place which is a must visit with children. They will thoroughly enjoy their time here and do visit the ""High Flyer"" show, it's the best show there is. We couldn't make it in time for the feeding sessions but I'm sure they would've been great too.

Be sure to take the tram tickets as that will save you a lot of walking, you can use it multiple times and every tram stop is where most of the to do things are.

Larry loft is amazing and do take the feeding cups for 3SGD, the birds will flock onto your hands/ arms to feed & its totally worth it, next I would suggest visiting Waterfall Aviary.

The kids play area is good too if you have the time.

Had a wonderful time here and will surely drop by during my next visit to Singapore."
,,Fair enough!,4.0,,"Firstly, here’s a disclaimer!! Am not really interested in birds and animals so this place wasn’t as hooking as others however if you are a bird lover than believe me this place is heaven for you. Me being a non bird lover didn’t get bored at all. I really loved the 2 shows over there."
,,Jurong is a Paradise for Bird Lovers,4.0,,"We booked the tickets online and therefore, did not have to stand in queue to book our tickets. Unless it is the peak season there hardly is much of a queue, anyway.

The upkeep of the park is impeccable. If you do not like walking for long periods of time, the tram ride is strongly recommended. But there has to be a better way to check if everyone availing the tram ride has actually paid for it. The tram driver (who doubles as a conductor), at every stop, will check your ticket.

The overall experience was grand and we managed to watch only the Birds of Prey show which was quite enjoyable. The complete experience of the park will consume at least 6 hours of your time.

Due to maintenance work one of the exhibits was closed to tourists. As a gesture of goodwill and courtesy, the management could have gone the extra mile and refunded a part of the entry fee to all tourists who visited the park that day.

Amidst the concrete jungles of Singapore, Jurong Bird Park is a pleasant sight to the sore eyes."
,,VISIT TO THE JURONG BIRD PARK,5.0,,Visit to the Jurong Bird park is always very pleasant. We have visited the bird park after a long time. We noted that the Mono rail is no longer there. Bird shows are delightful.
,,Coolio would call this a Bird Lover's Paradise,5.0,,This park is a must for bird lovers of all ages. The Lory is the perfect place if you want to get up and personal with the lorikeets to feed them. The high flyers show was my highlight. So many well trained exotic birds all flying around in the one place. Amigo the talking Amazon parrot will knock your socks off with his singing *****
,,Run down Jurong Bird Park,1.0,,The flamingo water fountain zone is badly maintained and look very dirty. The benches at the kid water play zone is dirty and not cleaned. The air con glass door at the kid water play zone near the eatery is faulty and knock against another glass door panel. you wonder when it will crash.
,,good place for family visit,4.0,,"we do enjoy all the collection of birds in the park, and it is easy to pass time with all the family together. Picnic is also great in the park."
,,Something special in Jurong.Lots of childhood memories.,4.0,,Good but a bit old. Excellent staff. Keep it up! Went on a Saturday but no crowd.Its time for a revamp.
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,Wonderful place to visit. Spend time leisurely and enjoy the place. Be hydrated as u need to walk a lot.use trams whereber u can.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Yep yep yep a definite dont miss this attraction ,so much to see my small review gives little justice to how good it was everthing from feeding the birds to lunch time shows great fun great for everyone a great attention singapore you got this so right"
,,Small park to visit,5.0,,"Located near to industrial areas, not big but should good enough for you to spend at least half day with your live one to enjoy the mini water park, bird talent show and hang around to visit and see the nice bird and flying animals in this park.

Moving forward this park is going to re locate so now may best time to visit before it migration where guess the park entrance would be even more expensive."
,,Birds of a feather,5.0,,"With young children around, the bird park is a mandatory outing for my family. But it never fails to engage our curiosity and awe. As children learn more about their feathered friends, we enjoy the day in colourful bliss. And the shows are a must watch. Feeding sessions are something my girls wait for. If you are visiting Singapore or live around and haven't been to the bird park in a long time wait no more"
,,Nice and lovely,4.0,,This bird park has more than 400 species of birds...it is better if you visit this place in the morning so that you can watch the bird shows which are actually very nice and amazing..this place has a vast area of kids to play as well..very well maintained and beautiful place to visit if you are visiting Singapore..
,,Birds of Feather flock together,4.0,,"A good place to see birds from all over the world, some quite intresting ones and in natural surroundings. A place that would be best enjoyed in a full day trip. Check the show timings to pre-plan the route."
,,One of Best Places,5.0,,"Very nicely maintained place. Do not forget to feed parrots in your hand, once in life time experience"
,,Average with limited burds,3.0,,Limited birds are available and majority of the birds are caged. I've been to several bird parks where the birds get to walk freely.
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,"Birds, Birds , Birds,.... Out in the wild, in the ponds, indoors - great photo opportunities, - and great for kids."
,,Good for visit with family,5.0,,Overall it is very good attraction. I recommend to introduce hop on/off at any place around the park. This will make it very convenient for elderly and small children especially on a warm humid day.
,,The best part of singapore,5.0,,"Do not miss this even if it is at the cost of everything else. This has been the best bird park that I have visited. It is very safe and well organised here, the bird shows are especially extremely good"
,,Quite a nice bird park.,4.0,,The bird park was tranquil and pretty. We saw many birds that we had never seen before. We stopped for an ice cream in one of the cafes to cool off and really enjoyed our time at the park.
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"Feeding time is when the park’s birds are at their most active.If your kids are an avid avian fan, he might enjoy camping overnight with the penguins and other birds. These organised sleepovers happen regularly, so check the park’s calendar for details.A great place to enjoy with friends and family. Dont miss the 3 main shows if you are planing to visit the park"
,,**2017 notes - Check before visiting if still open - is moving to Singapore Zoo soon **,5.0,,"I really enjoyed the bird avairy and saw some species I have never seen before. It does take a while to get here. Please check online before you go to see if still at same location as we were told it will be moving to Singapore Zoo at some stage. It will be sad as teh gardens / park are very well established and the waterfall in the avairy is really pretty. We did struggle with transport getting there (got off at wrong bus stop and had to walk 45 mins, in sun and wasnt happy when we first arrived). On way home was much easier as bus stop (that we should of got off at)was right only about 200-300mtr walk from the entrance."
,,Exotic Birds,5.0,,"I loved all the colorful birds in the park. This is a place after my heart. The birds are very beautiful. There are some shows where the birds are trained to paint too. This show is just amazing. Once you are at this place which is easily accessible by the MRT, you would have a fun filled day at this bird park."
,,Good for kids maybe?,3.0,,"Although I don't like zoos, after reading all of the good comments, I decided to give it a go. I should have listened to my heart. It was a waste of time.

There were many kids during my visit who seemed to enjoy very much and made a lot of screaming and noise. Most of birds are in cages so no good for photos. It is no point to try to observe the birds as one can do in the wild. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who is a natural life lover."
,,Wonderful Experience,4.0,,"Took ourselves to Jurong Bird Park. Started with a trip from Navena station to Jurong East on the MRT, this was a amazing experience. Trains are clean and every 5 minutes. Arriving at Jurong a short walk to the taxi rank were a transport officer opens the car door for passengers.
A drive of approx 15 mins and we arrive at the entrance to the Bird Park. First sight is a display with many species of parrots and the opportunity to have a photo taken. Grab a Park map and hop on the tram for a leisurely trip to station 1. Leave the tram and wander through the displays then pick up the tram again to the next station.
Outstanding displays although some appeared empty but actually birds were nesting so not visible.
We did not do the Australian section, we know our birds but rest of Park is very good, you have the opportunity to get close and personnel with the parrots and feed them, have your photo taken with them.
Told that in 5years Bird Park will be located with Singapore Zoo, good idea as both are an island apart.
Cab back to Jurong station, MTR back to Navena station and bus back to hotel. What top day."
,,wonderful exotic spot,5.0,,"embedded within tropical plants, flowers and trees, the bird park offers a variety of different attractions and possibilities to relax. Unfortunately, the the parrots cage was closed for renovation."
,,One of the best sights in Singapore!,5.0,,"Exceptional bird park and gardens.

My recommendation would be not to take one of the tours that offer to pick you up from the hotel. Typically they don’t give you enough time at the park, and they put you there when it is at the most crowded. Take your time. There is much to see. I also would not recommend the tram ride since you really just ride by the many attractions and don’t see anything. Simply follow the tram ride path. Many attractions that don’t seem much from the outside, but inside they are huge and captivating. You just don’t see it by riding by.

It took us about 4 hours to do the park. While we liked the shows, they were our least favorite part of the park. The separate exhibits and gardens were much nicer."
,,A well-spent Sunday,4.0,,"Its my 3rd visit to Jurong Bird Park, the last being about 8 years ago. Overall the park has many positive changes. Feeding of the birds at Lory Loft was the best experience for me, my wife and my 7 yr old son.
The water play area was a plus and the bird enclosures were properly marked and well maintained. We spent about 3 to 4 hours and went home with good moments."
,,Family outing,4.0,,I have visited the park many times over the years but i realised i have missed the hornbills and toucan exhibits all these while! That was the highlight of the visit this time round. Unfortunately we were stuck at the waterfall aviary afterwards due to heavy rain and there was no sheltered walkway to get to the tram station. But we managed to visit most of the places we wanted before that. Sad to find that world of darkness exhibit was gone and the emperor penguins seems to be missing from the penguin exhibit.
,,Diwali visit,4.0,,"too nice place to visit. great experience, beautiful birds, great place to spend 2 - 3 hours at least."
,,Awesome spectacle of colours and exotic birds,4.0,,"Visited the Bird Park with a 3 year old and a 7 year old, they had an amazing time there. Truly, memories are made of this, and it was a wonderful holiday in Singapore."
,,“I love the bird park”,5.0,,Quoting my boy on the subject header. That sums it up. We’re happy so long he’s happy. Food at the entrance cafe is also better now. I’d have thought the chicken rice will be the usual pre-prepared standard but it turned out quite original though. Only managed to catch the show at Pool Amphitheater which was interesting.
,,Very nice park,5.0,,Need about 6 hours in the park. Most enclosures let you touch the birds directly. Must watch both shows; very nice performance. Lunch with parrot is at affordable price. Great visit.
,,Birds close enncounter,4.0,,Jurong Bird Park is one of its kind bird park in the world. a must visit. lunch with the birds is a beautiful show you should not miss it
,,Must visit if travelling with kids,4.0,,We were there in April this year and the park is absolutely amazing.My 3 year old literally loved it as it has everything from shows to bird feeding to train rides.Its quite a big park so you are in it for a whole day but you can rest eat and also use train/buggy rides to roam around.All types of birds are there so you can choose your pick and visit what you like first.It seems you are so close to nature when you are visiting this one that the feeling is just awesome .A happy kid is what you need on a trip so a must do in Singapore.
,,Only one way to summarise the place 'Strictly okay',3.0,,"Nothing much to write home about. It is a place for people who love birds, that is it. Perhaps, it is one of the only bird parks around in the world but then, does it make sense to cage so many birds. Anyways, the highlight of the park are the 2 live events that they have - Kings of the Skies and High Fliers Show. Do check the timings of these events before you step in to the park. They are worth watching (heck, looks like they are the only ones worth watching).
Also, there is a small water play area around in the Jurong Bird Park which kids might love to splash around. It does tend to get a bit monotonous and with so much walking around, kids might enjoy in the water play area, so do remember to take your children's water clothes and a new set of change clothes if they want to go in the water play area. It is nothing fancy but then, getting wet with couple of slides is so much fun for the kids.

There is a single bus that travels from the Boon Lay MRT that goes to the Jurong Bird Park, right up to its gate, Bus No. 194. You need to get down at Boon Lay MRT and take the Exit D and go to the Boon Lay Interchange where in there are numerous stops for various buses with Bus No. 194 at one end for Jurong Bird Park. While coming back, you just need to get out of the Jurong Bird Park, cross the road, under the flyover and get on the other side and take the same bus to reach Boon Lay MRT.

Bus service in Singapore is awesome and it is worth the money one pays for.

Just do remember to buy an EZ Link Card the day you step in to Singapore - it costs about SGD 12 (SGD 5 for the card and SGD 7 for usage). But boy is this card helpful - any bus, MRT you can just tap in and tap out. No need to fish for change and ask for how much is it to travel to the destination. You can top it out at any of the MRT so you are good to go. Alternatively, ask the hotel you are staying at, whether they can provide you with a used EZ Link card - that way you can save that SGD 5 of the cost of the card too."
,,Awesome park - a must visit,5.0,,"This is a great place for people who enjoy watching different type of birds and is a heaven for kids. The best part of this place is the variety of birds that one gets to see at this place. There is a bird show that happens in the evening and is surely a must watch. There is also a high flier show and is surely not to be missed.

It took around 45 minutes from Merlion park by taxi and is almost a full day activity. Do remember to carry your photography gears. There are eating options outside the park so you need not worry about the same

Had a fun filled day at the park and would surely recommend this to other tourists as well."
,,Nice bird park.. enjoy feeding Parakits,5.0,,"This is unique place where you will enjoy going within cages of bird.
It is having three parts and most important is where you can see Penguins moving in habitats.
First part is of lodge where you can walk and feed parrots.
Second part is water world. Flamingoes can be seen here.
Two shows were memorable and great.
Enjoy Tram ride for transportation to parts of park.
Must visit it with kids."
,,Impressive bird sanctuary,4.0,,"Housing some very exotic and also large birds it’s an attraction for all ages. You can feed some of the birds and even let the lorikeets climb and land on you in the lorry loft. Birds of prey exhibit, bird shows and the incubation nursery are highlights."
,,Checking out the birds,5.0,,"We bought ticket at Singapore Zoo as part of the 4 in 1 package (Singapore Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park). We spent a day at Singapore Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari the day before from 11.30am - 10pm. The next day we took Uber to Jurong Bird Park, half hour from our hotel in Tyrwhitt Road.

We arrived around noon. After walking all day yesterday, we opted for the tram, it took us around the park, easiest way to see whole Jurong Bird Park.
The air-con enclosure of Penguin Coast was a welcome to Singapore's humid weather. We checked out the Waterfall Aviary with its suspension bridge and a 30-metre high waterfall, all birds roamed free in there.
The Flamingo Pool was amazing. We cooled down in the Breeding and Research Centre's air-cond room! And of course if you were travelling with the wee ones, splashed around at Birdz of Play.

Our favourite was the High Flyers Show at the Pools Amphitheatre (11am and 3pm).

Food were expensive just like the other three parks. Westgate mall would be cheaper option for food. Westgate, JEM and Big Box were three connected malls about 10 minutes ride by Uber.

Wifi at the park enable us to book Uber to I'm Startice - Korean Premium Shop at Big Box shopping mall at the end of the day.

Throughly enjoyed Jurong Bird Park."
,,Memorable experience at the Bird Park,5.0,,"Jurong Bird park again has been very beautifully designed and is very spacious. It was a very memorable experience to be amongst the birds, feel them and see them so close. The maintenance and care taken for the birds is remarkable."
,,Lovely relaxing day,3.0,,This as it tells y a bird Park it requires walking even if y take the little train in order to look into the enclosures -it is well laid out on a large hill with lakes etc -the eagles were my favourite-- the length of time spend depends on y but three hours did me
,,Birds of Multi Feathers Flock Together,5.0,,An experience of a lifetime since one life of travel would not suffice to see the entire range and variety of birds that Jurong has got together in one place. I loved the fact that all the birds were kept in an environment as close to their real world. The keepers were very caring of their charges.
,,Best Birthday Gift,5.0,,"Thanks for making an awesome birthday gift for my friend!!! I really appreciate your effort for making it work on the eleventh hour. I would like to add on I am totally impress on the service the operator handled and how clear they give their information. Finally, I am glad the refund is refundable!!! I am so happy that it worked out!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!"
,,Must visit for bird and nature lovers,5.0,,"Very well maintained place with acres of greenery and lots of colourful birds. You can feed penguins, hornbills and have luch with parrots. There is also a very famous show where you get to see a lot of birds and their cute antics. For seniors they have a buggy ride to cover the place but you have to book in advance. Strollers and electric scooters can also be rented. Get a park hopper ticket so that you can cover both zoo and bird park at a discounted price.
A must visit place in Singapore."
,,So vivid and so beautiful,4.0,,"The experience was amazing. From tiny penguins, colorful Macau, parakeet to 'Kings of the Skies'. They were all so well bred and well taken care of.
The ambiance of the bird park was great and the largest man made waterfall in a Bird Park...they thought of a perfect place for the birds, while showing them off to the world. That is simply world-class."
,,Birds in Cages,3.0,,"I did not enjoy the place much as I hate to see birds in cages. That said, this place is sure to delight children who can have a close encounter with birds. It does have a very large variety of birds in capitivty there."
,,young child,3.0,,The park should have more slops so that young child on pram or on the child wagons can have easy access as there are afew places with stairs and hard to manoeuvre around. And there should have more English maps are those that are available are in Korean and Chinese language.
,,Jurong bird park,4.0,,"Good fun place for young children. Lory loft feeding the birds is super fun. Reached easily in taxi . Takes about 4 hours if you see all the displays. I felt that the photographs taken and sold by the bird park right at the entrance of the
was exorbitantly over priced. We hired a trolley for our kid at 9 $ comes very handy. There is a Indian restaurant right at the entrance .. not great but can try. Must see in Singapore"
,,Birds Calling,5.0,,"Wow, wow and another wow. The birds seem so comfortable even when you are close to them and there are so many places to cover. Feeding the penguins is an awesome experience and you must make sure you do that. You would need the whole day to cover this place and the bird show is also superb."
,,Great Day Out,5.0,,"My wife last came here in 1971 when it had just opened and was keen to revisit.

Well worth the effort as, despite it being a fair way from central Singapore (although nowhere is very far in Singapore) a lovely way to spend a peaceful day.

This is also one of the few venues in Singapore that approaches 'Disabled Friendly'. Mobility Scooters are available for hire, 35 dollars - pricey! But for a few dollars there is a land train around the park that you can get on and off, as many times as you like."
,,Wow amazing place,5.0,,"It’s amazing bird park. Nice shows “ kings of sky” & “ high flyer” are simply wonderful. Children can enjoy here. Tram has 3 stations, Lory Loft & man made water fall, they take on ride."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"It is an amazing large park, beautiful layout, vast variety of birds including rare birds. My only problem was that I could not get used to the Singaporean heat and high humidity."
,,visit this park!,5.0,,"very well laid out and educational park, with birds and views that will leave you inspired at the range of this kingdom! a gem in the middle of SG!!"
,,All feathers,5.0,,walk in aviaries were my all time favourites and here it was complete with a 100 feet tall artificial waterfall.Some of the birds walked free and the rest chose to hide away from the rain.Casoworry bird was something hitherokidndly.
,,Bird of All types,4.0,,If you like Birds this is the place for you. All species a very enjoyable morning wandering around the beautiful park.
,,It's all about timing,4.0,,"If you really want to enjoy the Bird Park, it is all about timing, for example, the Kings of the Sky show featuring eagles, vultures, hawks, and owls, starts at 10am and 4pm, during my last visit, we decided to go after lunch, we were there around 1.30pm, taking a stroll, we visited the penguins, macaws, etc. then we stopped for the pelicans' show at 2.30pm. After which we proceed to walk around other exhibits, stopping at the Waterfall Aviary at 3pm for the feeding of the birds. After that, we took a stroll to other exhibits and arriving at the Hawk Center for the Kings of the Sky show at 4pm. My son had an incredible enjoyable time as it was well paced out, and we are not rushing from one point to the other."
,,Shows,4.0,,"Good but too many speaking. If it is only show n music, it is more interesting. Bird park visit with tram is good but too little of bird. Sometime dunno where they r located in the cage."
,,Very big Bird park,4.0,,I have seen some very rare birds in this park. Value for money. I spent almost 4 hours in the park and that was not enough. You should spend whole day here. Dont miss the Brid shows.
,,Amazing vist,5.0,,Lovely place with beautiful birds and wonderful activities. Perfect place for kids and adults. The birds were super awesome!!
,,Educational and Fun place for kids and adults alike,5.0,,"This was one of the best experiences of visiting Singapore. The bird park, if you have kids, is a must see. It's amazing what they have created. Not just for the rescue of endangered birds but also educational programs on the extinct ones."
,,BIRDS OF PREY- A MUST,5.0,,"We used the MRT & bus to visit very early as it opens at 8.30am, -it is out a bit from the city, Great attractions ESPECIALLY the BIRDS of PREY Show, we also used the Trolley (extra cost $5 each) when we wanted to get back to a spot that we had missed."
,,Birds of a feather.,5.0,,"We enjoyed this visit tremendously! The birds, how they are displayed with many flying in large enclosures that you enter and walk through with the birds flying gloriously around you.
You can purchase small amounts of liquid food for them and the birds delight in perching onto your hand and drinking the food."
,,Asia's Largest Bird Paradise,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is never miss attraction in Singapore, we reached here around 12.00 noon thus missing out on some of the shows and bird feeding. to see all birds and bird show it is recommended to be here at least by 10.00 AM. Many species of birds which can't be seen in our daily lives. Our children will find many amazing and interesting discoveries by visiting the bird park. its wort to see 30-metre high man made waterfall in"
,,Loved the flamingos,5.0,,To be honest I only came to Jurong Bird Park to see pink flamingos and wasn't disappointed. It was very well laid out and we saw many different birds. Ended up spending the better part of a day leisurely wandering through the bird park. Highly recommend.
,,Must-visit-in-Singapore,5.0,,This is a must see attraction in Singapore. Loved the entire ambience-especially seeing the colourful birds and also several shows is really wonderful.Children will love-This is a place which is very peaceful and the place where we can interact withbirds
,,Great experience,4.0,,"Great experience, Good shows. Check out the weather (rain) before visit. Park is clean and well maintained."
,,Bird Park,5.0,,One of the main attraction in Jurong bird park is Show(s). The call for volunteers and it is good experience to watch the bird perform. Multilingual bird singing song is wonderful
,,Has potential but....,2.0,,"This place has potential but has ageing infrastructure, is overpriced and very smelly. An abundance of birds but whole flocks of too many of one kind. The penguins are hard to see through dirty glass and most birds are behind thick wire mesh which is hard to see through. The extra costing tram only has 3 stops so not user friendly and should be included in cost of ticket. The highlight of visit is bird show but only shows are 11 and 3 and 4 hours at park is just too long to stay. There is a senior rate which at $13 is reasonable but they only give it to LOCALS...SENIOR IS SENIOR NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM...."
,,"A bit over rated, visit only if your itinerary is relaxed and affords half day of wastage",2.0,,"Quite far off and small, nothing great to write about it. Has one or two shows where birds will fly in and out and do some tricks. Though not ethical from a bird lover perspective, but if you park this aside you can spend 2 hours here.

Getting out of this place is a nightmare. Taxis are in extreme short supply here. Extremely poorly managed. No direct SMRT connect. Not easy to get to your next destination. So 2 hours to do the park and at least 1 hour waiting to get a taxi!!"
,,Excellent place to view some amazing birds,4.0,,"Excellent place to view some amazing birds . Excellent pics , especially birds with vibrant colours."
,,A must visit,5.0,,"A really good bird park, kids will love it. Suggest buying of tickets without the tram ticket unless you have old people with you otherwise it's a waste.

The enclosure where we could feed small colourful friendly parakeets was awesome. The bird show was good too. Get in early so you can spend the entire day in exploring the whole place."
,,Nice park,4.0,,"Nice park with many wonderful birds, unfortunately it rained very hard after we arrived here. Had a good time nonetheless."
,,Great and cool experience,5.0,,The collection of birds and rain forest trees are fantastic. Keep up the good work. IT is a great place for children. I had a fabulous time with my boy who love natures and animals.
,,Boys had fun. Very clean environment.,4.0,,Wud be better if there are more choices for halal food. All the local food are non halal.we have to finish the trip and go out to eat.
,,My kids loved it,4.0,,"My kids, 4 and 2 came back with names of the birds they never knew before. This proves that they simply enjoyed themselves to the max despite being drenched in their own sweat."
,,Birds of a Feather,4.0,,"For Avian lovers, visiting Jurong Bird Park is a must when in Singapore. The Show at 4:00 p.m featuring owls, vultures and eagles/hawks was quite interesting. The birds are colorful and worth the visit. Highly recommended."
,,Bird species galore,5.0,,Never knew there was so many bird species. Stunning display of trained birds in the ampethetre. Spent the whole day there. Fantastic
,,Gorgeous birds!,4.0,,"Spent half a day at the bird park. Although I'd purchased tickets online (to avoid the queues), I still had to queue at a ticket window to get the actual ticket???! WTF? Once we got in, mu blood pressure went down as we sought out the many & varied bird species. Easy to spend longer there, esp with children in tow. Gift shop is expensive (of course)."
,,Great for kids,4.0,,A fantastic day out for the family. The water park was great to cool us all down. The penguin enclosure was awesome.
,,Helpful and thoughtful staff,5.0,,"I was with three kids, and had to get a wagon to keep them all together. Unfortunately the payment counter was not working and I was told to make payment near the entrance. I told the staff I just walked in with 3 kids and to go back all the way to the entrance is tough with all the crowd. Another staff came and offered to help me make the payment at the entrance and came back with my change. Thank you so much!! It is such little gestures that make the experience worth while. The kids enjoyed the show and the vast array of birds on display."
,,I love birds more now,5.0,,"I really enjoyed my experience at jbp. It has been long since I came back. I have a pet bird of my own. After visiting jbp, I learn to appreciate and understand birds better. And I am very happy I did. I just wish I could had more personal interaction with the parrots. It was too bad the parrots paradise was closed temporarily! Will look forward to visiting again for the exhibit."
,,Better than we imagined - teens liked it too,5.0,,"Spent a number of hours here on Sunday 1 October. Not too crowded. Definitely worth a visit - Lory Loft aviary a highlight and even tho we're from Australia and used to seeing lorikeets all the time, was still great to see different varieties plus all the other birds.
Sad so many are endangered or threatened in the world :(
Took cab there and back and didn't need food there as had big brekkie in Chinatown before we arrived.
Teens loved it too"
,,Kind of over-hyped,3.0,,"If you have seen Mysuru Zoo, you will find this place a tad too boring. The parrots enclosure was closed for upgradation when we went. The High Flyers show was good though."
,,Great way to spend a day,5.0,,"You should definitely visit this place, to connect with nature a little more closely. The top 3 things to do here are the Lory Loft, The Hornbill Show and The Raptors Show. Do not take the tram ticket, it is very easily walkable. The gift shop is good, and they have a kids play area as well. Take a swimsuit along for the kids, as they have some waterslides etc"
,,Dont miss this!!,5.0,,Excellent collection of birds. All well nurtured and taken care of. This is not a place to be missed at all..entry fees are a bit steep though!!
,,A Must see for anyone traveling to Singapore,5.0,,"We had an excellent time at Jurong Bird Park. We are a young family and had a chance to visit the bird park with our 2.5 years old on our ex-Singaporean friends recommendation. And oh boy, we had a blast at this place. We took Uber to get to the park - it was approximately 20 min drive from our hotel.

The bird park opens early and we could easily spent 4-5 hrs at the park before heading to the airport. We had fun feeding the colorful lorries (birds) at the Lorry loft.. We saw many hornbills and tucans flying around in their chambers. The African penguins swimming and feeding was a sight to watch. There are multiple shows that occur at different locations within the park and one can enjoy these to learn more about various birds and their habitat. We had an opportunity to enjoy ""Kings of the Sky"" show that spoke about vultures, eagles, hawks and ospreys. It was a brilliant show.

There is a tram that takes you around the park and stops at 3 different locations to ease mobility for the tourist. You need to buy a separate ticket for that if not included in the entrance ticket. There is a separate kids water play area for kids to just have fun at the end. All-in-all a great experience."
,,Amazing for friends and family,5.0,,"Definitely a place to go. Watch all the bird shows and catch all the feeding times and get onto the unlimited tram rides for $5 only. valid throughout the day. the shows are free. the high flyers at 11am or 3pm and the kings of the skies (predator) at 10 or 4pm.

Should try their HOMEMADE ICE LEMON TEA at the HAWK CAFE. it is to die for!!"
,,For Bird lovers to visit,4.0,,"This bird park is located end of city and it is good place to visit especially for bird lovers.

We had great time there during our visit. You can feed different birds if you are aware about feeding times. We got a chance to feed parrots.

Dont miss to take 'Tram' ride !"
,,"Well Kept and Managed Excellently, This is a Bird Park Definitely Worth Visiting!",5.0,,"Bought the tickets from WeekendGoWhere for SGD20, a slight discount compared to other sites.
What i like about the bird park
1. excellent variety of bird species! and the whole park is all so well-kept and maintained
2. i love the bird shows. You'll be impressed with the intelligent birds that perform and it's alot of fun for both adults and children. In fact i volunteered during the show and the Cockatoo placed a coupon in my open palm! Free soda for me!
3. Many opportunities for taking colorful, beautiful photos

Advice:
- if you don't mind the walk, you don't have to get the tram ride. for my husband and i, we just took a nice walk to ensure we didn't miss any of the birds. It's tiring but just go slow!
- plan your time around the bird shows n do get there at least 10-15mins earlier so u have good seats. n don't be shy to volunteer! =D it's so much fun
- Go early! we were there the minute the gates opened n were done after lunch."
,,"Meet thousands of your feather friends in a natural, verdant, equatorial setting",5.0,,"Despite the mild travel tiredness and a slight jet-lag, we decided to visit Juron Bird Park on day 1 of our stay in Singapore... 5 days and several other heavy hitting attractions later, this one still remained the most memorable for me... being the nature buff that i am.

The park is expansive, beautiful in the middle of hillocks and the flora is thick and that of a rain forest. Many of the plant species we'd encountered in the Indian Subcontinent, but many many others were exclusive and such a treat.

There were birds from all across ... for me, stand outs were the flaming pink flamingos, the birds of prey - not having had the opportunity to meet the himalayan vultures so close at hand! The butterfly park and the museum is engrossing if that's your thing - I dallied there forever.

There's even an iguana you can touch and feel - skip it if you're not a reptile person!
I did not get over my fear of being around reptiles at close quarters.

The shows are exceptional - especially the one on birds of prey - its a treat to watch the keepers' and their wards work in such close unison!

If you're a bird lover, this is a perfect day out!"
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,An early scenic attraction updated to provide variety. It is temperature controlled so it was pleasant
,,shows are good but overall not great,3.0,,"it has lots of greenery and bunch of happy birds, shows are the attraction and very nice, but morning show got cancelled due to rain.
but have some suggestions to improve:
1. Tram is totally waste of money and useless - its a multi bogey fossil fuel driven belching unburnt fuel smell, which has like 3 stops which are useless as you have to walk to each enclosure. They should learn from Delhi zoo, where battery driven single bogey tram continuously move around so you visit one enclosure and then can catch the next one to go farther.
2. there are few trams, so you wait endlessly for one to come, and after the shows or on crowded days, this is quite painful
3. the strollers provided are not ergonomical nor shaded, they should check with Universal studios, as rental charge is almost same"
,,Asia's largest bird park,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is reputed as the largest bird park in Asia, with more than 500 birds of around 400 species, covering a total land area of 20.2 hectares! You'll surely be amazed by the colors and beauty of the birds in the park ... birds of paradise, hawks, flamingos, parrots, emus, swans, penguins, and much much more!

Aside from a wonderful display of birds, there are also regular shows in the park (like the High Fliers show, the Kings of the Skies, etc.). You also have a chance to feed some of the birds or have your photos taken with them. If you get hungry, just go to one of the eateries in the park (like Pizza Hut). Lastly, don't forget to visit the Waterfall Aviary (where you'll find a 30-meter high waterfall, said to be the highest man-made waterfall in the world).

Jurong Bird Park is fun for both adults and kids. In fact, they have a dry and wet play zone area called the ""Birdz of Play"" for children. For souvenir, drop by the park's gift shop. To get a complete visit of the place, you may take the tram that moves around the entire site. The park is open daily from 8:30 AM to 6:00 PM. You may take a taxi to reach the place, or take the MRT, get off at the Boon Lay station (green line) and take a shuttle bus from there."
,,Excellent bird park with nice shows to involve audience,5.0,,"This is a bird park with enclosures and different species inside it. Mostly tropical and equatorial. But at the entrance you have penguins in Antarctic atmosphere. Amazing to see them glazing in the artificial snow produced by machine. Then you have 2 shows one at 3 pm involving most birds and at 4 pm involving eagles, vultures, owls and hawks. Well trained birds and not to miss the talking parrot. Parakeets, flamingoes, Roosters etc steal your heart by their performance. The language is English all the way. There is a tram with audio to take you through the park for the weary legs. This covers the park in half an hour whereas if you need to walk it would be atleast 2 hrs. The shows/performances are 20 min each. And the park is to the west and on the edge of the city, takes about 30 min to reach from central district like Rochor. You have a souvenir shop cum restaurant which has decent spread. As usual things are expensive than the city."
,,Caring attitude - benchmark for other attractions o/s,4.0,,"Firstly I will tell you I am not keen on animal parks for personal reasons. However a day was to be had at the Jurong Bird Park as my significant other wanted to go there and also our child to see the birds as well whilst in Singapore for holidays.

The first part of the day was very humid and we spent time walking to see the flamingos, followed by Pelican cove and swan lake We stopped at Waterfall Cafe and whilst I recovered from the steamy day in the cool of the cafe the more energetic went up the stairs to the viewing platform. They told me it was good.

I believe we had lunch at Songbird Terrace where our friend and child left us after eating in the a/c little cafe. Not much seating here when very busy. Little shop located at the other end of the rectangular shaped area where cafe located had some good gifts but on the higher side of pricing, but at least I could see the staff were happy and obviously the money would go to the upkeep of the animals health etc. We purchased some stuffed toys to take home with us and give as gift for friend's child at school (she was thrilled with the bird we purchased incidentally). The toys seemed well made.

By the time we got around near Window on Paradise, we decided to go back to the main entrance after that as we were near the end, however we made the choice to see the toucans and Hornbills located just to the side of the road/walkway. This proved a difficulty to get back as just before we could walk back to the main cover the skies opened up and it rained heavily. The cover we did find nearly met it's match in terms of water on the ground as the water from the rain was almost torrential! However what an experience to watch the rain come down like that and it was just us there, there was a lot of thunder and lightning but we were safe. After what seemed like a fairly long time we managed to get back to one of the tram stops with an umbrella we had in lighter rain.

However we had been going the wrong way on the pathway and would need to go back around the track, virtually around the whole park. However before too long a staff member appeared in a golf cart style vehicle and asked us if we wanted to go back to the entry/exit?! He even apologised for the vehicle not being totally covered up. At this stage I didn't care but it was covered over our heads. In reality as long as it had four wheels and a steering wheel to get us back I didn't mind. I was exhausted from the day as we had walked in the heat which was our own choice as the attractions are fairly close and paved to each other. I asked how much was the lift back to the entry/exit and he said it was at no cost and the park realised that there is not much cover in rain weather. Joseph was the staff member's name and he was extremely polite and friendly to us. I wish to specially commend Joseph in his appearing at just the right moment and his super polite manner. In the end it made a difference to how we felt at the end of the day after being rather exhausted and our child wanting to go back to the hotel.

The kind park staff who directed us around the water that had slightly flooded in the pathway to the entry/exit. They made sure we went the right way to get out and that we didn't get lost in my haze of tiredness.

Once again the Singaporeans have been very kind and giving. They made us very welcome wherever we went like friends. Thank you Jurong Bird Park and staff.

There is a few really good photo opportunities, one is near the Pelican Cove were there is an outdoor gazebo. However take mosquito repellant for around this area or you will get bitten. Especially for small children who may react to the bites."
,,It had a cassowary so it exceeded my expectations,5.0,,"The animals here are brilliant. A large range of hornbills which I love one me over. The bird show in the amphitheatre was well worth any effort in getting to the park. The park is associated with the Singapore Zoo but a good 20 minutes cab ride from it. There is very little cover from rainfall if you should happen to go on a rainy day, which is very possible in Singapore as showers and rain came through every 2nd day during our (September) stay."
,,Excellent,5.0,,A top afternoon despite the humidity! The shows were excellent and the variety of birds and the enclosures were the best we have seen.
,,Great day out,5.0,,"My Husband is very much into Birds , me not so much, but I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed seeing all the birds and the beautiful colours of some of them . Definitely worth a trip to Jurong Bird Park"
,,Expensive for Locals,2.0,,"Expensive for locals. Should have more discounts for Singaporean, Carpark should be free, The Lory park should be more like Langkawai Bird Park. Not going back."
,,Great visiting to the Bird Park,5.0,,It was fun and very interesting and education trip for my nephew. He enjoy a lot at the birds of play area and all the bird show. And also feeding the birds at the Lory Loft area. A very great experience for the whole family.
,,Was great!,4.0,,Was a great experience. Only gripe was that the good restaurants are at the entrance so having a meal means coming all the way to the entrance
,,Wonderful family outing,5.0,,Great experience and very close contact with birds. Kids were pretty excited to feed the birds and so were we. The bird show also pretty impresive. Man made waterfall adds in to the natural forest environment.
,,Recommend a visit,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a great place to visit early in the day, or later, when songs and activity are at their peak, for birds!"
,,A good activity with kids,4.0,,We visited the park and spent half a day here. Its good if you are interested in birds and colours. The park is well maintained and very clean. All facilities are available
,,Get your Photo with the Macaws,4.0,,"Great park, designed for kids and families. Very good exhibits of birds of all sizes, types. Live shows and demonstrations together with a large free flying netted aviary .You can pay to have photos with smaller parakeets or holding some of the very colourful, larger macaws. Do this together with the Butterfly and Insect Park, the Sentosa Merlion and Fort Silo, on Sentosa. The fort is very interesting with its static displays and movies of past events, surrender of Singapore . This will fill in a full day for you and worth the effort."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,We bought tickets that included the tram ride around the park. There were really excellent provision for seniors or those with mobility problems with wheelchairs and motorised chairs available for $5. Fantastically laid out and with the most wonderful waterfall 5 storeys high. Great exhibitions and feeding times available -flamingoes were a sight to see and at the lorikeet aviary you can feed the birds-wonderful rich colours that I had not seen before. Well worth a visit.
,,Great bird variety,4.0,,We spent a morning here and it was great to see the different birds. Tram car is worth the extra $5 as gives a different perspective than just walking around.
,,Nice attraction for kids.,5.0,,"It’s quite a fun experience if you're travelling with family & kids. There are ample opportunities to take pictures of the colorful birds around the park. Bird shows are great. Avoid the monorail as it makes you miss a lot of sections, better to visit all sections by walk.

The Jurong Bird Park is probably one of the best places to view birds."
,,Waste of time many better things to do skip this,3.0,,Somehow I didn't liked this place as this was our last thing to do in our list. Still I will recommend this too skip this. Zoo night safari river safari were so good that you just fell like why we have come here. If you have time den take a walk dere. It's far also.
,,A neat place to visit,4.0,,The bird park is a great way to spend a part of your day in Singapore. There are so many great birds to see and the park offers several shows during the day as well. The park also offers a tram ride around the park with several stops so you can get off and explore as well.
,,Follow up visit,4.0,,"It's over 20 years since we first visited the Jurong Bird Park and we thought it would be good to go again. We had a very pleasant afternoon viewing the bird life, strolling around the undulating site, lots to see. If you have the time while you are in Singapore it's worth a visit."
,,Don't try to finish Singapore in a rush,5.0,,"Friend don't believe I spend 8 days in Singapore......and trust me we has something to do everyday.

Amazing city for a holiday with children between 8-12. I normally plan to finish these kind of places when my kid is growing. I plan holidays as per his age and that's how we all love it and Singapore was the perfect choice..... we love to go back to there"
,,Outing on a drizzly day,4.0,,"Had a very pleasant family outing to the Bird Park. Aside from the birds, the tropical lush vegetation alone is worth a visit. For me, the Lory Loft is the highlight, with its ""hands on"" experience with colorful birds literally feeding off your hands
There are a number of food outlets , so you definitely won't go hungry
Scale is small, so you could easily walk , instead of hopping on the tram
For rainy days, it would have been better if they had more covered walkways. It can get crowded with bus loads of tourists"
,,Dated but worth a visit for the Bird Show,3.0,,"The park is worth a visit even though a little dated, showing its age, and a little pricey at $34. The bird show is fun and kids will love it. Take a seat on the terraces near the 2nd or 4th aisle half way up, and the birds will zoom over your heads. Look for the perches at the entrance. The finale is brilliant, get your video camera handy."
,,Visit only if you have spare time and young kids,3.0,,The place is good but far off with no other addons in near by area. One show of birds is good and the other one is average. Max 2-3hrs with a Very relaxed walk. In one enclosure you can feed beautiful birds who would come and sit of your hand for food. That's the only fun part for a photo session . Visit only if you have spare time else avoidable.
,,Fab day out,5.0,,"We visited the bird park on 24th August and had a fabulous day of fun.
We enjoyed all the displays, they are entertaining and you never feel that the birds are stressed at any time.
We spent pretty much the whole day working our way round and it is the best bird park I have been to.
Lots of information on the exhibits and the staff at friendly and helpful.
It is logically laid out so you can meander your way through without feeling you are missing bits, the birds are amazing and seem very well cared for.
Can't fault it really!"
,,superb jurong bird park,4.0,,"visit all places in the park including amphitheatre, penguin feed, tram ride, bird show is worth a visit."
,,Awesome collection of Birds,5.0,,This place is must see place of Singapore. But you need to walk till your last breath to enjoy the whole bird park. Shows are good.
,,Kids enjoy it,4.0,,"Small and Beautiful park - we keep coming back again and again. We may need better connectivity to main MRTs at reasonable price for families to come together. Also, we need vegetarian food options as it is very far away."
,,Looking a bit dated,3.0,,"Nice place and fun for families but showing its age. It is overpriced for what it offers. Nevertheless, we spent an enjoyable couple of hours here, taking in the 3pm High Fliers bird show which was fun, then doing a circuit in the tram which cut out having to walk uphill in the humidity. One of the best parts is the gift shop and cafe next to the Entrance. We were told that the park may be shifting to Singapore Zoo within a couple of years which might explain why the place is slowly running down."
,,Brilliant !!,5.0,,"We stayed at Swissotel Merchant court and took a cab to the bird park(20 minutes drive). Once there, they offer you packages and we took the zoo and bird park ticket which was good, but since we arrived at 10.30am, we could see the park only on that day and had to see the zoo on another day. Having said that, you need to spend the whole day at the bird park if you truly want to make the most of It, or else have to wake up really early and be there as soon as the park opens.
Once you enter the place, the pelicans, parrots, peacocks and especially the eagles and vultures are truly beautiful. Every enclosure provides us with ample information about each species, which is what I especially liked.

The two bird shows cannot be missed. All in all it was a wonderful experience."
,,The most vivid aviary,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park, a superb aviary and one of the major attractions of Singapore is spread over 49 acres and houses approximately 400 species of birds. The spectacular bird show has the world's largest number of performing birds in a single act. Besides highlighting the antics of talented birds like the mimicking cockatoos, the bird show is also a window onto the natural behavior of birds like pelicans, flamingos and horn-bills. A must visit place."
,,Just okay,3.0,,Nothing very special compared with average zoo with the birds. And also quite far from the city center. My kids only liked to feed the birds. Recommend only if you have spare time to spend after visiting the zoo nearby.
,,Fun place for bird lovers,4.0,,"Unfortunately due to the nature of birds, most of the exhibits are in cages so it's not as immersive as the Singapore Zoo. However, it's still a nice place to walk around. The shows are quite good - the Birds of Prey especially. We went and my friend got on stage and had a vulture land on her!

There is also a very nice hidden waterfall near the end of the park (connected to a cafe). You can walk up some stairs to get near the top and there are a variety of colorful birds walking around in that area.

There's a bunch of penguins there. so cute."
,,Kids water playground is very good,5.0,,To bring along the swim suit for kids. they would love the water playground. Many kinds of birds are presented and the show are professional as well
,,One of my favourite attractions in Singapore,5.0,,"It's an attraction that contains many different breeds of birds. It's great for an educational trip with the kids. There are interactive moments like at the Lory Loft where you can purchase feed for the lories and they will flock to you. The park is easy to walk about (you will hardly miss any exhibits if you go round the park). There are 2 different bird shows and both are amazing. Be prepared to spend a full day here, or at least half a day. I wouldn't recommend a visit on a rainy day though, somehow you won't be able to see as much."
,,Excellent place for Bird lovers,4.0,,The number of bird species here is amazing. Dont miss the raptor show which we really enjoyed. We missed the Hi Flyer show which we are told is very nice too. Great place to take your kids and learn about many bird species. As usual fantastically organized place.
,,Fun place for kids,4.0,,"The bird park has lot of activities for kids like Lory feeding, feeding bread to flamingos. Also they have two bird shows which are very informative and exciting for kids."
,,A must visit,5.0,,"Everything is good especially the birds feeding shows. The park itself is delivering very unique experience where you can see & enjoy your time with almost all kind of birds together in one place. This is amazing experience for kids & adults. Book the train tickets, have a round with the train 1st to get a glance about the garden then plan your schedule to attend all the special shows. It's really deserves to be attended because it's really amazing."
,,holiday stopover,4.0,,The Bird park was a very enjoyable day. Ensure you go in time to see the shows and allow between 3-4 hrs. Food options were not very good at this park and it wasn't as good as the zoo but still enjoyable
,,Well Worth a Visit,5.0,,"We took a taxi from town, but suggest you book a return taxi as the queue for a taxi was long, as was the wait. The park had some very nice displays and the bird shows were a highlight. Well worth a visit, but arrange your trip to align with the shows, unless you want to spend all day there."
,,Good for Tourists to Visit. Many birds to see. Ideal for families and young children,5.0,,Review by Dr Sim. Good for tourists to visit if you have the time. You need at least half a day to a full day to enjoy the walk through the park. Bring you own water. There are drinks available but like all attractions you pay attraction prices. Many birds to see. Ideal for family and young children. Regards Dr Sim
,,Variety,5.0,,1. Bird park with unique features. 2. Easy navigation 3. 1000 species of colorful birds from Asia to America 4. Don't miss the shows 5. Kids will have fun 6. Be ready to walk 7. Carry umbrella if weather needs
,,Good but disapointing,3.0,,"The bird park is good, but being a photographer I could not alway get the shot I wanted because of the small wire on the cages.
Some birds were very hard to find
They did have mobility scooters that were a great help as to walk around is about 3km."
,,Great day out,5.0,,We love Jurong bird park. Have been coming on and off for 7 year. My daughter especially loves the water play area. Never seems to busy which is nice when you are walking around Would recommend a visit
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,I am not a bird person so when the friends that I was with wanted to go to the Bird Park I was not too thrilled. But when I got there I was very happy I went. I enjoyed seeing all the different species of birds and the shows. I would highly recommend going to this park again.
,,Great Bird Park,5.0,,This Is One Of The Greatest Bird Park which Contains Every Soecies of Bird In It You Can Enjoy The Ride Of The Park By The Train Also It Has Flamingoes Too It has the Largest man made waterfall Excellent Place To Visit
,,One of the Best Parks I have Been to,5.0,,"This is One of the Best Parks I have Been to.. Clean, tidy with excellent collection of species, shows and many more.. A must see destination in Singapore..!!"
,,Birds & Birds,5.0,,Lovely place for kids & family. My daughter loved the place. All the bird verities in the world. Very well maintained. Impressed about the facilities available for kids. Price is not so cool though.
,,Visit the famous bird park,5.0,,Bird lovers delight it must be; a great collection of birds from locally and internationally. A photographer's day spent here will satisfy his quota of shots for a while . Birds fly freely in the largest aviary ever and exotic ones hide in special enclosures.
,,Bird's Eye,5.0,,"This is as good as the Singapore Zoo, but it is full of a thousand variety of birds. There are around 3 shows in the bird park too. Eagles and vultures ranging over you, Flamingos walking the rampwalk, and all kind of exotic birds you have never seen so UPCLOSE.
Do remember to spend some time at the lorry loft where you can feed the birds. The park has been built in such a safe and friendly manner with birds hatching there everyday. The birds therefor know of no danger and when you are at the lory loft, the lories come and sit on you, over your head and shoulders. It is just an amazing place to be."
,,Not as fancy as I had imagined,3.0,,"Its good for kids and especially for people who have never been to a bird park before (say San Diego), otherwise its okay. what is good, is that it is walkable for elderly people and children. I was in time for the show, during afternoon, and i was overall impressed.

Now some practical stuff:
1) In case you tend to use MRT, come to Boon Lay station, head straight towards the bus terminal on the ground floor and ask for the bus number (i forget now), its 15 minutes then. So if are a group and not on tight budget, might as well as take a cab!
2) Jurong Bird park and Night safari are two different places. First thing, you should ask is when the bus departs from Bird Park to the Jurong Night Safari. We did not ask as we did not know nor was there any board which says the two are different. Hence we missed the 5 pm bus and instead took the cab"
,,An extensive park with nice shows,4.0,,"Everything is costly in here, as the case is with singapore. But a wonderful day can be spent here for nature lovers, though everything is caged, they are doing some great conservation work as well especially regarding hornbill conservation. Must see for families and kids."
,,"Truly, fun for the whole family",5.0,,"This is a wonderful place. I saw so many birds that I've never seen in my life, including a Bird of Paradise, which I had never expected to see up close and in person. The bird shows are fantastic! My husband is NOT a show sort of person, and was grumbling about it before we went -- but it was delightful and he was enthusiastically clapping along with the kids. We fed the lorries and it was a fantastic experience to have them perch on your hand and guzzle from a cup of nectar. Highly recommend."
,,Great day out,4.0,,"Love the bird park, we have been multiple times here. Love the Lorikeets, all the animals seem to be very well looked after, with plenty of food and access to clean water- we were very impressed by this. All staff seemed very knowledgeable and were always willing to answer any questions. The food courts were a bit hit and miss, having got to the indoor waterfall to find what was effectively a snack shop, was a shame, but it was too hot to traipse around looking for somewhere else. Would recommend the mini-train ride around the park too."
,,Good... If you children,3.0,,"We are a fam of 4 .We are adults .We got a package combining the JURONG bird park , the ZOO, and another place which I cannot recover and we did not go also due lack of time .. If you are really interested in birds you will be thrilled .. I went mainly for penguins . lol . It was quite hot and you gotta walk uphill and down for visiting . They got a really huge children's park which is really cute . They have some water themed park for kids as well don't forget to bring the swimsuits. Overall it was quite good . but u have to walk a lot"
,,Very rude and racist staff,2.0,,"While the birds are beautiful anywhere as well as here, had the terrible experience at the Flamingoes show where the male staff (apparently Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi) was extremely rude. The american managers of theirs are even more rude and made us move out of the queue, with racial overtones."
,,200 species of beautiful birds,4.0,,"This aviary is located on approximately 49 acres along the western slope of Jurong HIll. In one corner, you will find a collection of flightless birds (considered dinosaur descendants). You'll also find 5 species of penquins & discover the parrot show during lunch in front of flamingo lake."
,,Nice Place for kids,5.0,,The shows are very nice. Lot of different birds to see. If travelling with kids please carry swim wear and extra clothes so that kids can enjoy in the water play area in the park.
,,Best bird park,5.0,,Best bird park. Fun to see colorful birds shows including parrots. A place to experience while traveling in Singapore.
,,Bird Park Singapore,5.0,,"Just visited Singapore with my son for summer vacation.
Jurong Bird park was the first thing we decided to visit(we were suggested to see this first as we purchased a good deal four themes in one pass).Online please check for Park Hopper Plus Package tickets.. its also valid from the date you choose upto 6 days so you can organise your visit accordingly keeping with other attractions as Zoo, River safari, night safari....
This Bird Park is absolute gem and make sure to find hawk show and Bird show timings so you can be there while looking around other things at the bird park.
Make sure to take photos at the Cockatoos and parrots corner (they charge about 20-25 Sig $ for few photos with a nice post card album).
has a lovely Penguin (covered look through glass) corner theme, very cute and some exciting pictures to be taken.
A lovely scenic water fall too for a memorable pictures.
i suggest keep all day or atleast half day to finish this Bird park to be visited.
have a great day!1"
,,Colorful and must visit !!,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is home to the world's largest walk-in lory flight aviary at 3,000 square metres and over 9 stories high. Featuring 10 colourful lory species, this exhibit is a favourite amongst guests who get to feed the gregarious lories a nectar mix while observing them up close.Its a great place for kids too & they would enjoy every bit of it."
,,Great place for Kids,5.0,,"Jurong Birdpark is a great place, for kids and adults as well. Keep a full day..and comfortable shoes..lots of walking..check on the show timings and dont miss. There are two shows..one bird show which is a must with Palickens, parrots and pink storks and the other is for predatory birds which the kids may not love. But first one is not to be missed. Look for the waterfall if you are click friendly...options to eat and kids love the water park..all in all a plus plus...great day full of fun and learnings.. Feeding the parrots was fun in the cage"
,,One of the Best Bird Parks,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is one of the best bird parks that one can visit. The aviary with the 30 mtr height man made waterfall is the highlight of the park. If one is here during feeding times, it is a nice experience to feed the birds here. Various shows like Birds of Prey are quiet awesome to watch. Plan for a full day trip here if one wants to experience this place completely."
,,Good place to spend with family,5.0,,"This bird park is a very huge bird park situated in Jurong area of Singapore. The bird park has lot of recreational and interactive activities where in bird experts engage people from the crowd. Do pickup the schedule pamphlet from the ticket counter to see the list of activities scheduled in the entire day and at different places of the park.
The park is lush green and one has to walk a lot in the park to see whole of it. It consumes entire day of yours and you can stop at multiple hawker stalls to eat/drink or even rest
Kids will surely love this place and so will elders, so when in Singapore plan a day's visit here."
,,Please visit if you like birds,3.0,,Certainly a large selection of bird life.Park is getting on in years and it does show.While kept clean some areas look a little tired and in need of a spruce up.
,,Take your time to explore the park,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a lot of fun. I suggest going early to avoid the crowds, perhaps prebuy your tickets because the queues are outrageous.
I recommend taking the tram to get an idea of the whole park first before splitting off to follow your nose.
I visited Jurong Bird Park through RMG Tours- I do not recommend this. It takes too long in transit and I didn't get as much time at the park as I wanted. You should Spend a while there, there is a lot to see and do, the variety of birds is impressive and their enclosures seem elaborate and reasonably natural.
Take your time here. If you just run through the park you'll be the usual suspects- pelicans, flamingoes, penguins. If you take your time, you'll see the smaller birds, the exotic birds, the amazing bird shows.
A lot of the park seems to be a bit run down and out of date, undergoing maintenance and the like. It's still in working order and there's still a lot to see, but it's not a modern, seamless experience like the Night Safari."
,,Communion with birds,4.0,,"Great place with kids, they will love it , birds everywhere in all shapes and colors. A must visit in Singapore."
,,Must visit for bird lovers,4.0,,"Its a paradise for all bird lovers. This place offers you to meet a huge variety of birds across all continents. Some tips for visiting this place

- Book your tickets online to avoid queue
- This place offers hip hop tram ride so include that in your ticket. The tram doesn't operate during heavy rains
- You can also rent a battery operated bike at 35 SGD for a day
- Ensure that you have taken the park map before you start so that you dont miss anything
- Explore the park in a planned way as there are 2 bird shows in 2 different areas of the park. Both shows are worth viewing"
,,Birds and Shows.,5.0,,A huge park well organised. The shows were 1) Kings of the skies 2) High flyers and the 3rd one is Penguin coast.
,,Good choice if you are accompanied with Kids,4.0,,Very colorful and beautiful birds. Wide range of species from all over the world. Do check the timings of the special shows and plan your time accordingly. One can spend here 4-6 hours but it could be tiring as well
,,Great for bird lovers,4.0,,The jurong park is lovely for people obsessed with different types of birds. It is a great place to visit by yourself of the children and show them the varieties of birds this place has to offer.
,,Very interesting bird show,4.0,,"I went to the park since morning with my family, we enjoyed the bird show very much and then we went for the water play and stayed their for almost 2 hrs, my daughter loved it and i was prepared for it this time as i brought for her swimsuit, we did not have time to go over the whole park as i was traveling with a baby and i had to cut it short."
,,Huge Aviaries,4.0,,"This park is quite far. I heard that they are going to move this place beside the three zoos so you better visit this park before they shut it down.
I'm fascinated with birds so I guess I liked it!
The place is elevated so I think it's not good for oldies but they have a tram.it's better to take a tram to go to the stations.
The aviaries are huge and the birds are well taken care!
The vulture show is amazing! I really loved it!
Some of the areas are not that maintained but the nature and habitat feel is still there.
There are peacocks that just walking around the zoo! Next time I'll bring grains so I can feed them!
There's a hanging bridge and waterfalls!
All the staff are friendly"
,,I'm biased!,4.0,,"I'm completely obsessed with birds and have a huge fascination with zoology so this is obviously biased, however, this place FELT like Jurassic Park at points and that just really appealed to the kid in me, and I'm sure it will in most people!"
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"Brought the kids to the bird park. This is probably my 4th or 5th visit but it is the first time going there as a parent. Tips:
- bring not just a camera but a 360 camera if you have one
- stroller for kids is a must as there will be lots of walking
- go on a weekday
- bring your own water or you will have to pay for expensive drinks in hot weather"
,,Cant afford to miss it!,5.0,,"This is the best attraction of all in Singapore. From hornbills to cassowary to penguins to parrots, everything is a must watch. Look out for bird sightings that bird park organizes at scheduled time of the day. You should make a point to feed birds as its an experience in itself."
,,Good for Family with Kids,4.0,,"It's a place to go to if you have kids with you. Jurong Bird Park is one of the bests in the region - I think it is the largest in Asia. Not only that they have a great variety of birds but they also host some great shows. We watched both the High Flyers' show and the King of the Sky show - apparently we liked the first one better. I would suggest you check the show times from the website and plan your tour accordingly. The bird feeding experience was really nice as well along with the walk down the stairs.

There is a kid's play area with lots of water activity. So go prepared accordingly. And in case you want to go easy on your foot, do buy the tickets for the trams. That way it is easy to see the whole park without getting your feet too tired."
,,The best place in Singapore,5.0,,"This was my best place in Singapore. Had a great variety of beautiful birds, very clean. Well maintain gardens and areas. The waterfall is amazing, feeding of birds at lori loft was a beautiful experience. 2 shows: high flyers and king of the skies at 3 PM and 4 PM were very good. Kids will love it."
,,amazing visit,4.0,,"a wonderful place to visit. it is far from the MRT station you need to take a bus or a taxi to reach there. you will see a many different types of birds and you will get informations about them. if you like to walk in the park you need a comfortable shoes because it is a large park, btw you can take tram ride if you don't like to walk but you need to pay for it. the best part of the this park is feeding the parrots. i recommend to watch the shows of the parrots and the eagles."
,,Magnificent birds in natural settings,5.0,,"This bird park is highly recommended if you are at all interested in ornithology. A huge range of bird species is on 'show'. In particular, there is an excellent flying demonstration of raptors with informative commentary. You can easily spend 4 to 5 hours at the Jurong Bird Park and never be bored."
,,Interesting venue to visit with kids,4.0,,The Jurong Bird Park has a wealth of information about birds. You can enjoy the falcon show as well as the Penguin Show. The tram ride takes you around the park main attractions. You can also grab a quick bite.
,,Unforgettable Visit,5.0,,"If you love nature and wildlife this is the place to visit! It takes a bit of getting too, especially if you want to save money and use public transport BUT when you get there you will have an amazing day out.

Walking through the giant aviaries is amazing experience and the diversity of birds that are in the park is incredible. The best part of that part of the park was feeding the parrots that are quite friendly and will even sit on your hand when you do it.

The highlight though was the bird show where they have various different types of birds 'performing' in the arena where they show off their hunting skills, tricks and natural habits. The birds are incredibly intelligent and the trainers are really expert at handling them.

We went as a couple but this would be a great day out for the whole family. They do have some eating places there but the food is a bit basic and its also a little bit pricey. That aside, it is still worth a visit."
,,Great Experience,4.0,,A great day to spend half a day . Very well presented and informative . Great for all the family . Must see .
,,Fantastic must see for birding enthusiast,5.0,,"Excellent park for anyone even remotely interested in our feathered friends.
Very easy to reach by public transport MRT to Boon Lay and then 194 bus to gate entrance.
Some excellent exhibits including snowy owl, parrots, flamingos and lesser bird of paradise. The raptor show is superb though probably only disappointment is bird of prey display as fencing doesn't really allow for decent view of birds
The waterfall aviary exhibit however is sublime"
,,A Colourfull collection of birds,4.0,,Great collection of Birds -nice natural settings. It was especially nice to be able to feed some of the birds.
,,Yes its worth a Visit,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is definitely worth a visit. We took the MRT to Bay Loon then took the 194 bus at the interchange bus station and it took us straight to the door. Very good way to get there and cheap. I wouldn't really bother with the lunch with the parrots bit, we did it and I think wasted our $25 per person lunch [very ordinary] and the bird show was not that good, you actually don't get to have birds around you whilst eating the like pictures show you in the brochures/website, if you are lucky enough to get a table at the front you will see more than most and you need to pay $10 for a painting, painted by a sulphur crested cockatoo for the privilege of having your pic taken with a bird."
,,Not as I expected,3.0,,"I'm not sure if I went on the wrong day or something because on the day I went to visit Jurong Bird Park, the place was lifeless; not the way it was when I last visited 10years ago."
,,"Very nice, have good collection of birds",5.0,,"Very nice birds park, have lots of varieties of birds... best is the African penguins, falcons. The bird show is not to miss attraction ... one should also not miss the bird feeding."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,Singapore Bird Park is one of the best in the region. Suitable for all ages. Highly recommended for families with children. Great place to educated the kids.
,,Educational and entertaining,4.0,,The bird park is rather old but has undergone upgrading. It Long history also means that there is a very capable team of Trainers and Presenters for the bird shows. I would recommend spending at least 5 hours between 10:30-3:30 at the park. This way you can catch both shows at 11am and 3pm. The shows features small birds as well as birds of prey. In between bring your kids to the water park and be thrilled and cool down in hot and humid Singapore. Admission to the water park is free. Take a tram ride and you must stop at the aviary and macaws enclosure. The tram ride gives visitors a clear idea of what the park has to offer and you can selectively choose what and where you wish to spend your time.
,,hey birdie!,5.0,,the bird park is a fun place. there are lot of birds and one of the most important thing to do in singapore. The place has talking parrots. Amazing place for kids.
,,Good for Families,4.0,,"To get to the bird park, take the MRT to Boon Lay then bus 194 which drops you outside.

It's quite a large park with a large number of birds from all over the world, although primarily tropical zones.

I enjoyed the flamingoes, macaws, birds of paradise and also the Andean condor. There is a breeding programme here for rare species as well as displays for younger visitors.

It's more geared up for families with fast food outlets and play areas. I paid SIN$29 for admission plus an extra $5 for the tram which I did not use.

However, the far side of the park is fairly hilly and anyone with mobility issues would be best using the tram."
,,Good for kids,5.0,,Good shows involving various trained birds like parakeet owls etc. Good fun esp for young ones. Nothing to miss a lot if not able to visit it due to packed schedule.
,,Good exhibits,5.0,,"We went 10 years ago and it still a good experience. Looking a bit tired in a couple of the aviaries, but doesn't detract from the experience.
It is a long way from singapore town but it should not stop you from going. We understand they are moving in a few years."
,,Love the Pelicans!,5.0,,"We went as a couple and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!

Jurong Bird Park is well thought through and offers many ways for visitors to be engaged. You can experience the birds up, close and personal as there is a enclosed section where many birds run / fly freely. You can feed the birds during feeding times. And the shows, which offer some interactive elements, are superb!

We love the pelicans! Watching them during feeding time is a hoot! Storks that are not from the same exhibit will come and steal the food! The bird keepers feed them nonetheless to prevent the storks from attack the pelican eggs.

A really fun outing. As with many places of interest, F&B in Jurong Bird Park is expensive so pack a picnic, or bring your own drinks!"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"What an awesome place to visit. We were amazed at all the beatuiful birds here and how close you could get.
Was amazing that they would come and land on you and eat out of your hand.
Great fun for all ages.
Bird show was great too."
,,Jurong Bird Park.,5.0,,Very well laid out and a very entertaining show / feeding opportunities. It will pay to plan your visit well.
,,Wonder place to be in,5.0,,"We started our visit to this country at this park. One will be surprised on how well this has been made and maintained.
A half a day visit if you have time.
Its awesome to say the least. Numerous birds.. Impressive enclosures, chance to feed a large number of them..
The birds are very friendly:) they've got used to the presence of friendly humans.
A great waterfall adds to the value of the park.
Must see for sure.."
,,A must 3 hours visit in singapore,5.0,,"Its a little far from the center of singapore, but worth the 20 min drive. Ive never seen such magnificent birds! wear long sleeves and take a lot of water with you!"
,,Good opportunity to see birds up close,4.0,,+ Excellent place to view different birds; + Feed Birds from a hanging bridge about 9 stories high + Few good Shows - Only 2 hour attraction - far from the city
,,visit,5.0,,This park is really well appointed and here you can see birds from all over the world in an almost natural surrounding.
,,Easy to get around and lots to see.,5.0,,"We started off by doing the round trip by the tram. Second time around, we stopped off at each of the stations and visited the birds. The lorikeet area was very interactive as you can buy small tubs of liquid food that is good for the birds. I had the birds sitting on my shoulder and hands while they drank the liquid from the tub. Wonderful experience."
,,One of the Best bird parks,5.0,,It is a well organized park with many bird shows. There is a tram service which you can use in case don't like walking much. I was able to watch their bird show at pools amphitheater. Altogether it may take around 3 hours or more to cover the full park.
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"The Park was very well maintained. I was really impressed by the sheer amount of birds there. To be absolutely honest, I was expecting a small park with a bunch of caged birds dotted here and there, but no. Not that sort of a bird park. It has a bunch of ""open"" areas where you can walk in and the birds would just casually walk up to you and stuff. Overall really nice park.

Staff-5/5
Place-5/5
The Parrot I had a conversation with-6/5"
,,Best Bird Park,4.0,,This is one of the best bird park in the world. Very well maintained place with good shows to entertain the children. Interesting place for birders.
,,WOW Superb,5.0,,"Plan for a entire day trip and you must see all the shows, kids will just love it. Please keep yourself well hydrated and do not rush.

Word of caution : Kindly do not combine any other trip with Jurong Bird park as it will be hectic"
,,Lots and lots of... birds,5.0,,"Haha, this is a bird park, so if you're a little squeamish about walking through a huge cage of birds, this is probably not the place for you. If you don't mind birds, or if you particularly like birds, this is the place for you. You can even buy little bird seed cups and have birds eat out of your hands. It makes for some nice pictures!"
,,Awesome. .must must go,5.0,,This open bird park is one of its kind where birds are just flying..sitting on ur hand.. eating next to u.. This I will rate one out of top 5 place to visit in Singapore
,,This is a MUST SEE!,5.0,,"You must spend a day at the Jurong Bird Park while in Singapore. We went by subway train but you can also take tours to get there. Whichever way you go you will not be disappointed. I finally got to see the rare Bird Of Paradise I have been wanting to see all my life. The range of birds is amazing and there are 8,000 species there believe it or not. Also a lovely man made 100 foot water fall is incredible. PLan to spend the entire day. Also there is a tour bus that cicles the park a few times an hour to help people who have trouble walking get around and see the different areas."
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,Bird Lovers Love it. Nice photography. Good bird shows. Food available. Taxi easy to get. Located western side of the island.. 45mins to town.
,,Children may enjoy this park better.,3.0,,"I like birds so I joint a group tour to the bird park. The park is smaller than I expected, so was the varieties of the birds. It maybe better fit for children. As the small train took us around the park, the audio recording introduced to us the various areas and their residents. After getting off the train, I headed to the first of the two bird shows I had planned to see. It was quite entertaining, especially when audients were invited to take part in the event. Because of the rain the second show was cancelled ."
,,A Great Opportunity,4.0,,"A surprisingly well organised Bird Park. If its not here , its probably not a bird. Its a much larger park than I anticipated. Its mostly outdoor not the 'stuffy caged up sad zoo type' places. The most impressive thing was the giant Toucan enclosure. The noise from these very powerful birds wings is truly prehistoric."
,,"If you like birds even a little, its a MUST!",5.0,,"My husband is a huge bird lover so i must say i ""reluctantly"" agreed to go here! It is 20minutes out of the city (which is a long way in Singapore!) and we had already done the zoo. We travelled with our 10 year old son and we were very impressed. Make sure you time your trip to make BOTH bird shows. They are seriously impressive. Seeing Toucans & Hornbills was very cool. It is a huge park and the variety of birds they showcase is literally mind boggling. The Lory feeding aviary was my favourite. For $2 you can walk around & the birds (mainly Lorikeets) land on you and chat away as they feed. Very cool! My husband loves Palm Cockatoos (very rare) and they were flying around in this aviary so he was mighty impressed! Sadly majority of the cages are quite small wire so getting photos of your favourite bird is very difficult. Seeing them is easy though! They told us they are building a new bird park next to the zoo & moving it but not until 2020. In the meantime, i would say this park is definitely worth a look."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Although further out than many other tourist attractions and the six mosquito bites I got, I really enjoyed myself. A must see is the 10am hawks show. The 11am show is also good but I left soon after as the park became full. If you can, quickly rush over to the owl exhibition as a queue will develop after the show.

I would recommend spraying some DEET beforehand if you're very prone to getting bitten like me. Also plan to see everything before the 11am show as the park gets very hot, humid and full."
,,Not great compared to zoo,3.0,,"We have visited many bird parks in Australia and away overseas e.g. KL and I was disappointed - I was expecting same standard as the zoo - I can see they are moving the bird park to the new zoo location -as its looking very tired ,,, but the bird park was old and run down and cages were historic looking. The zoo was very spread out so you had to walk long ways till you saw something and felt bit lonely in parts- the kids were hot and found it bit hard going.
the only good part was the lorikeet enclosure but the variety in here was not great - they had a few friendly vareitys of lorikeets birds but some of the rainbow lorikeets were bit testy and angry..
was a lovely enclosure but having a good vast variety of birds everywhere would be a brilliant tourist attraction. looking forward to seeing the new location."
,,Exciting place to be,5.0,,"Jurong bird park is a must see attraction for nature and bird lovers. It has 2 amazing shows which you must not miss. Highly recommended for nature lovers, family with kids."
,,Birds of the Tropics,4.0,,"Variety of tropical birds that will astound you. The patrot show is extremely entertaining and demonstrates the ability of parrots skills, intelligence and need to be active. A crowd pleaser and staff are respectful and accomodating."
,,Good place for kids,5.0,,I love this place so much. Kids below 3 years old are free. Yeah . I got my daughter a free ticket. Park the car in car park almost 5 hours only cost us SG $2 for parking fee
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,World class...well maintained bird park. The park is neat and clean. Birds are healthy. The shows are exciting and entertaining. The whole family enjoyed....including adults. Enjoy
,,ALL TYPES OF BIRDS IN THE WORLD,5.0,,The best place to watch closely all the types of birds in the world and also some birds on the verge of extinction. Especially for bird lovers.Easiest way to travel is by MRT and than take a bus which drops you right at the doorstep of the park.
,,Good one,3.0,,Bird park has lot of amazing birds and shows. Not to miss the lorry loft. Must visit if you have time in singapore.
,,All time favourite for kids!,5.0,,"I got the annual pass for the park hopper which entitled my family to go on all parks like zoo, bird park, river safari and night safari for free entries. All time favourite for the kids! Many things to enjoy there including a water playground. As a member, we are frequently invited for their exclusive programmes for kids! Recently the kiss went had a great fun with the parrots!"
,,Beautiful birds in beautiful surroundings,5.0,,"This park was amazing, the bird cages were huge and well landscaped. Was lovely seeing the different birds in a more natural habitat. Watched 2 shows, both were entertaining but preferred the one in the arena to the bird of prey one. The talking and singing parrot was hilarious. An enjoyable day out for all ages and easy to access via public transport. We got the metro to golden village and was a 5 minute bus journey from there."
,,Entertaining as well as educational,5.0,,Park well spread out so relatively safe from hoards of people. Attraction times well spaced. The birds looked happy too.
,,Worth a Visit,3.0,,"Its not near or connected to the Singapore Zoo or Night Safari. Its a good 20min taxi ride away.
The park visit needs a half day. Preferably starting at noon. All the bird shows after this time will be in a cooler temp and more enjoyable. Make sure to carry enough drinking water .
And a good camera."
,,Wow! Huge and diverse bird sanctuary,5.0,,We were amazed at how large and diverse this bird park was. You can spend hours walking within the park enjoying the many species. There is an entertaining bird show that runs multiple times daily and opportunities to get up close to birds and feed them. Plenty of places to rest and there are multiple snack / eating places to regain your energy. And even a nice store on property! Highly recommended for the entire family.
,,Nice spot,4.0,,"Nice way to spend half a day and see some interesting birds. Easy to get to. Good value if you get the multi park pass that includes the zoo , river adventure , and night safari."
,,A half day tour with the birds,4.0,,"Kids like the show very much! And also can take photo with birds, the best is they know how a bird hatch from an egg!"
,,Worthy visiting,4.0,,Thought this would be the same as any other bird park but it has its own beauty. Shows are a must see and the park is not so big but exquisite one
,,"Great for Bird, lovers! Don't forget your bathers!!!",4.0,,We visited here as our 6YO is Bird mad! We caught public transport but hadn't realised it was little far out of town so be prepared to rail then bus to get there if your doing the same. The Bird show was quite entertaining and the kids loved splashing in the water park.
,,An Amazing Day with the Birds..,5.0,,"Wonderful place for all ages. Kids will love this place. Don't miss the live shows and also to feed the birds. Birds come flying to you to eat food (which u have to purchase - 3$) kids wil love this also a good day with lots of experience for adults too. Also they got a Tram taking you around the park. Recommend you guys go take a walk though the jungle / park. U will love it.

Keep 3 - 4 minimum."
,,Jungle in a concrete jungle...,4.0,,"Juring Bird Park is a wonderful place to visit. Hundreds of bird species can be viewed here. There are some shows too, demonstrating the natural abilities of birds. You can have great photos taken (for a charge) with the park's famous large parrot collection or if you like, you can feed the birds ( with birdfood sold in the park). There are adequate signage everywhere and they help to identify the birds and learn some of their habits. Some birds could fly away if they would want to, but instead they hang around the parks ponds or roost in the gigantic trees. The vegetation is fabulous, real tropical rainforest-like, thus creating a jungle-feel. However, outside the park there is another jungle: the concret jungle of Singapore. If you visit the park, it may be a good idea to bring your own cut lunch or snacks and some drinks because the eating places there are perhaps a little expensive. There are endless photo opportunities of course, especially on a nice sunny day.You can reqach the park by public transport from Singapore or if you can afford it, take a taxi (appr. $20-25 Singapore one way). On the way back it may be a good idea to order a taxi to the exit by phone or ask the consierge to order one for you. There maybe a few people there, waiting for a cab, but if you order one, yours will arrive soon and you don't have to line up and wait."
,,Visit to Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"Visited the bird park this morning with my family, it was great and wonderful outing. Have not visited the bird park for quite some time and was surprised to the changes and improvement done.
Enjoyable for family outing with young children. It's worth a visit now as the bird park will be relocating in 2020.
You don't have to go far in search for food,
the park have a number of food outlets for you to have snacks, lunch or just a bite. We had lunch at Curry Garden, the food was great but it's a self serviced restaurant."
,,exciting !!,5.0,,a plethora of beautiful birds all over. you get a chance to see them so close and even feed them...such exclusive species all under one roof !! a must visit in singapore !!
,,Spacious bird park,3.0,,In Jurong Bird Park is a collection of bird species from various countries. There we also presented some attractions of the show of several birds and they showed their abilities guided by the animal trainers.
,,"What a collection, a must see",5.0,,Our young ones had a gala time soaking in the activities of various birds in the park. Must take the Tram ride to avoid too much walking. Plan your trip matching with the show timings.
,,Not just a zoo,5.0,,"As a bird watcher and wild animal lover I don't like to see caged creatures and my wife was surprised when I suggested we make a visit. But the reason I like this place is because of the breeding programmes the park has. The park is well laid out but requires a lot of walking, so make sure that you have good walking shoes and plenty of water."
,,Amazing park to visit,5.0,,"The park is quite large and has a lot to see so we followed the advice given which was to do a loop on the tram and then walk to the best attractions. We ended up walking around most of the park and it was amazing. So many birds and the setting for the park is beautiful with so much greenery. Whilst most of the displays were great, I was concerned at the small space provided to the eagles. Having witnessed them in the wild soaring in the sky above, I thought the small enclosures were simply too small for them to do much flying. But apart form that, really enjoyed ourselves. The macaws were huge and very colourful."
,,Impressive array of birdlife,4.0,,"We visited the Jurong Bird park recently and were very impressed. They have an interesting array of birdlife, including some Australian emus and pelicans! Well laid out, and with different shows featured throughout the day, it was an enjoyable way to spend some time whilst in Singapore. There is a small train which ferries people around if you can't manage the walking."
,,Bird lovers paradise,5.0,,Wow! This is a must see for anyone who has an interest in birds. The collection is incredible and the message of preservation of our planet for our animals and birdlife is highlighted in all they do. Loved the shows which were presented in a fun & educational way.
,,Nice for kids and adults!,5.0,,Excellent way to pass afew hours seeing a wige variety of birds from all over the world. Children can feed parrots and enjoy a pretty show with birds.
,,jurong bird park,5.0,,excellent bird park.you will experience the large number of collections of various bird. you can touch and feed them
,,more of hype,3.0,,"good and well maintained, nothing big of sort. less birds, no walk with birds, waste of time. better do in kuala lumpur."
,,Great bIRD sHOW,4.0,,"My first time here. Saw a lot of bird variety including the pink flamingo. I am most impressed about the bird of prey show, which showed the eagles and vultures. Saw the talent show of the different talking birds and bird flyer. Unfortunately, the weather was bad and could not take the tram. Place is small but good enough."
,,4 Parks in One,5.0,,"Singapore has placed the Jurong Bird Park - the Night Safari - the Singapore Zoo and the River Safari all in the one area, great move so you can (if you have the time) to visit all 4 one after the other. All well worth seeing"
,,Must do if you love birds !!!,5.0,,"Best part of bird park are the shows. Don't miss them .

There are just too many birds and I got a bit bored but it's a paradise if you love birds.

So how much time you spend here depends on you.

There is a shuttle bus to pioneer mrt station on green line so you can take that if you want to use public transport ."
,,Bird watching at its best,5.0,,We never knew that bird watching can be so fun. The park is well planned and neat. They have lots of attractions and tram ride is must. They have an area where you can feed the birds and birds are all over you. Around 3 birds were on my son. One on his head and two on his hands. Kids enjoyed a lot.
,,Very good,5.0,,"This was a fantastic family day out with excellent bird flying displays. They have an outstanding collection of birds with the highlights being the hornbills, birds of paradise and waterfall aviary. They also had a great puppet show that kids enjoyed."
,,Absolutely enchanting,4.0,,"A must place to visit in Singapore. Has battery operated cart to take you around. Has a wonderful bird show. Like other tourist attractions is wheelchair, pram , stroller friendly. Has water fountains for drinking spread across the whole area. We saw a Lion dance as well, as part of the Chine new year celebrations. You can feed fishes to penguin after paying 3 SGD. Has a small store for buying souvenirs. Children of all age enjoy, the various shows. Make sure you plan your trip accordingly, as it might take couple of hours there moving between various shows, and watching them. You would get dead tired as well, there are some eateries as well to snack on."
,,Worth visiting Bird park,5.0,,Excellent parade in a live show at the bird park twice daily & must watch. Mostly at 11 am & 3 pm. Nice penguins & Flamingos.
,,Good and worth a visit,4.0,,"It's nice Aviary with a huge collection of birds and also shows that involve birds. Its a good visit with children, especially while watching the shows."
,,Jurong bird park,4.0,,This is a nice bird sanctuary where you can see different types of birds. There is 2 birds show that you must see. Take clothes with you if you have kids as there is a little water park inside.
,,excellent,5.0,,i jus loved it as it is very beautiful and clean . very organised . the people are very good . love you all.
,,Tour with Tour East group,4.0,,"Took this tour with my 12yr old son.Pick up was on time, guide polite and gave necessary information (but nothing more). The bird park was amazing. Lori Loft a particular favourite, but not for those who dont like contact. The tight schedule of tour ment we didn't see half the park only a few exhibits at the beginning, high flyer show, lori loft and waterfall. I would describe the tour as more of an escort, as there wasn't a whole lot of information about the birds, park, area, being shared. Towards the end of our trip thunder began rumbling, (we were happy for a storm to cool things off) our guide appeared concerned he would get wet - we stated we were fine with a bit of rain, yet he hurried us along. Very much looking forward to returning one day but will just attend the park and not book 'tour'. Tour was prompt and well organised, it just didn't provide the experience we were after."
,,A Must Visit Bird Park,5.0,,"Whether its feathered birds, or pink flamingoes, Jurong Bird Park is a place for all - young and old alike. Plus the bird show at 11.00 hours is simply superb and is a premium attraction there !"
,,Fantastic park,5.0,,Definitely worth a visit. Beautiful variety of birds on display. Shows are also worth a watch. Check show timings and don't miss any. Birds actually can be fed by you n makes for some nice photos. Take a tram ride through the park n a boat ride in the lake. Plenty of games n rides for the kids to really njoi.
,,SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL!,5.0,,"This place has variety of birds from parrots to falcons to Ostriches and what not. You also have a Parrot Lunch @ SGD 20, which is pretty unusual. There was a parrot show where one of them sang birthday song. The birds are highly trained and friendly."
,,Bird paradise,5.0,,"A place for an excellent day with birds of all sizes all around. Must visit for children.
Do not miss the high flyer and kings of the skies show. Plan your day accordingly to include these shows. Spend some time in the aviaries especially the one qith waterfall.
Special tip: when watching the high flyers show ..sit in the middle for the best view as well as yo be considered for volunteering for some activities . We sat right in front for better views but my child lost all opportunities as the vokunteers were always picked from middle rows due to the format of the activity."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,Spent a whole day there - incredible range of birds and really great shows. Can catch the tram around the facility if you don't want to walk.
,,wow,5.0,,"What a bird park !!! Simply exhilarating. From the bird shows to the tram ride, from the walk in the greens to the bird feeding shows - this is stupendous stuff. Dont miss it for anything. Though Jurong bird park is located at quite some distance and has issues as far as connectivity is concerned, the effort was worth it. Please buy the tickets from Klook and you will have it cost effective as well."
,,Return to the bird park,4.0,,"Came back to the bird park yesterday with my daughter (7) and son (3) in tow. This time they were mainly interested in the lory feeding, and then talking to the parrots. But they also enjoyed quick visits to the other exhibits too. Fortunately the weather wasn't so hot and as a result it was easy enough to walk all the way around. The annual pass here is very good value, although this time we opted for the 4 park annual pass."
,,Jurong Bird Park Singapore,5.0,,Fantastic place to visit. Superb selection of birds in well cared for enclosures. Very tidy and clean. Well worth a visit.
,,Good way to spend a few hours with children,4.0,,"The park is really park like with little zoo feeling. There are water courses & a small,lake & even a waterfall. The birds seem well cared for. Birds of prey show was unusual & informative not just entertaining. Parrots show was fun. There is a free tram that makes a circuit of the park if you get tired of walking. Metro from downtown & connection to bus to park is easy."
,,Must see.,5.0,,"We took the combo ticket for all.parks in Singapore. The hopper plus ticket is worth it and can offer discounts of about 50%. Buy it online on their website. The shows at 10am and 11 am are great to watch. Carry an umbrella as unlike river safari, which is covered , here one has to go in open. Has an Indian restaurant too!"
,,"Beautiful bird park, a must see",5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is as nice and as well thought out as the Singapore Zoo. It is easy to find whatever you are looking for by just looking at your free map or following the many signs scattered throughout the park.

There are a couple of shows you can watch, I was able to see called the High Flyer Show, it was a fun interactive 30 minute show that everyone seemed to enjoy.

There are many flamingos in Flamingo Lake, there was a penguin enclosure, and a beautiful aviary called Waterfall Aviary because of the 100 foot waterfall on one end. There are several observation points in the aviary that give different views of the waterfall. As I was exiting the aviary a Sun Conure landed on my shoulder.

I spent several enjoyable hours in the park, it was absolutely beautiful."
,,Fly high,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is among Singapore's attraction. It is one of the many parks you can bring your kids to have a whole day of sight seeing the different birds living here. One cool part are the scheduled feeding, same as in the Singapore Zoo. Also the scheduled shows where it is both educational and entertaining. The amphitheaters area usually full, so come early for nice seats. It is also interactive, nice for kids to be in."
,,Can give a try,3.0,,Visit the place if you young children who love birds. Nothing much. Can give it a miss. Bird show might excite you if you havent seen one so far. Or else a pretty OK place to spend a good 3 hrs time.
,,If you are a bird lover,5.0,,"actually by what i experienced doing all 4 things, Singapore Zoo, Night Safari, River Safari and Bird Park was a mistake. My kids got so bored by the time we got here that they did not even want to stay here. we just took the bus ride and left after watching a show."
,,Pretty Cool,4.0,,"Smaller than Singapore Zoo. Jurong Bird Park is an attraction one can consider when holidaying in Singapore. You wouldn't miss much not going, but if you have the time to, dropping by would be worth it too.

There are a range of birds, most found in South East Asia, but the concept is rather similar to the Singapore Zoo.
Trams are also available upon purchase with entry tickets, but it really isnt necessary to hop on a tram here. Its small enough to walk and you'd be missing out on seeing various bird species when on a tram.

Mosquito repellent should be part of your to bring items. There are water coolers situated around the Park, so don't worry about being dehydrated. It can be a rather hot and humid walk, as it is outdoors with not much shelter along the walking path."
,,Beautiful Park,5.0,,A must visit place in Singapore. Shows are very nice and there is a large variety of birds. Children and adults will enjoy alike.
,,Paradise for bird lovers,4.0,,"Highlights -
lory loft
Hawk show
N parrot show
But a ticket that includes unlimited tram rides .. some of the drivers were rude and not helpful ( we had wheelchair and a pram) but most of the staff was
They don't have a feeding / nursing room only open diaper change area but on request they opened the guest/ prayer room multiple times and were very kind :)
It did not seem like a whole day event as mentioned if planned well"
,,Didn't really enjoyed it,3.0,,"Overall is still ok, quite a large collection of different species of birds. The show is still acceptable but nothing to shout about."
,,Half Day tour to Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,Jurong Bird Park is away from Singapore and needs 4-5 Hours. There are 2 shows (10:00 AM and 11:00 AM) which should not be missed. There is a good indian restautrant (Curry Garden) with lots of food choices.
,,Must see Attraction when visiting Singapore!,5.0,,"Famous from the 70s Bird park that still holds the Tallest Artificial Wayterfall"" title in the world. A good educational visit for the young and old with birds from all over the world that is well designed and wel maintained with a great Bird show!"
,,Good couple of hours...,4.0,,"We enjoyed our visit, the park is beautifully done generally with plenty of public facilities (toilets and drink fountains).
The labelling could have been more informative/clearer in many areas. It is on a hill so be prepared to walk UP at some point!
The parrots etc. we felt could have been displayed better - maybe something similar to the waterfall aviary which was VERY good. particularly as the cage mesh is so thick it is hard to take photos.
The High Flyers show was good and funny, also informative.
We enjoyed ourselves."
,,A good place to see a wide range of birds in a good environment,5.0,,We went on a Tour East tour of the bird park. This ensured that we had transport to and from the park as it is out of town. The tour was helped by the onsight transport between various exhibits. The show was excellent and the exhibits were also excellent. The only down side was another tourist taking flash photos of an owl from close up and the absence of any security to remove them from the park. It can't have done any good for the owl's eyes as the flash was only 30 cm away.
,,Awesome,5.0,,1. Only issue is it very far from the city. 2. Lots of birds and their Bird show at 3:00 PM was wonderful. 3. Penguins are really awesome.
,,An excellent zoo,5.0,,There are no birds in Singapore except at the Jurongs. This is vast park. It is believed to the largest walk in aviary. There are bird shows which are entertaining as well as educative
,,A complete package to learn and see various birds,5.0,,"One of a great attractions in Jurong. You need spend a lot of time here. There are various birds that you can see and learn. Also, don't miss the bird attractions, really entertaining. What an impressive place."
,,Last Visit Before It Moves,4.0,,This park has a very special place in most Singaporean hearts as we grew up with it. Still remember the school excursions here with our classmates. Now it is slated for relocation to Mandai and this present place will be demolished. Sad for many of us. We will miss the man made waterfall and the open aviary.
,,A good place to visit,5.0,,We have been there along with family and we could able to see many of the birds we have never seen before. From Vultures to different parrots and different birds were there in the display. It's well maintained place. Must visit for bird lovers and photographers.
,,Perfect for Bird Lovers,5.0,,"Plan to visit around 9 in the morning, so that you can analyze the maps and shows before you begin your journey.
We took 1 round by foot and covered all cages, then we took 1 tram round to enjoy beauty on wheels. Try no to miss any show, the shows are the backbone of this place. Carry water bottles, sun shades, sun block creams."
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"We say worth a look because I have some spectacular exhibits but some exhibits that really need improvement in my opinion. The waterfall aviary absolutely fabulous the real light enclosure with a super large man-made waterfall and viewing points around both sides of the enclosure, when inside the nets are so high and the enclosure is so large you are not aware that you are inside and aviary.
I hope sometime in the future some of the birds in small enclosures might be treated to a larger aviary like the waterfall.
There is an inexpensive tram ride around the park with various points to hop on and hop off, I would suggest you take a full drive around to figure out which items you would like to see which ones you can manage to walk to."
,,One visit to b made,3.0,,Its well maintained park with variety of unseen birds... Its widespread and has many bird shows as well.. Main drawback for is was the weather. It was so hot the the kids couldn't enjoy as they should be. We also missed few shows just becoz of the hot weather... Taking parrots were missing as I've heard they are wonderful but this time couldn't see them..
,,This will take you all day to cover,5.0,,"If you love birds this is a must do. Not only all types from all round the world, but shows on at different times so you do really need to allow a minimum of a half day and get there early."
,,BEEN TWICE AND WOULD GO AGAIN,4.0,,This is a lovely relaxing place. And while you are there you can have a good time studying some of the most stunningly beautiful or interesting birds on the plant. I love the lorikeet enclosure. You can forget you are in a managed facility in there as the birds fly near by or play in the trees. Its a great place for kids especially if you are trying to get them to be interested in and respect nature. But there are plenty of elderly people in there too enjoying the birds. And the 'train' that ferries you around means the walking isn't onerous for the elderly.
,,The variety of birds is startling.,5.0,,Great for everyone including children. Very clean place and organized. A nice place to meet many species of bird. There are some shows also and all are very nice.
,,Good for families with young kids,4.0,,Tips Visit at 9.30 in morning. There are two shows.. Hawk show and Bird show (11 am). Shows are really nice. Take tram ride at the end. It's very long walk. Kids May feel tired.
,,RUBBISH!!!,1.0,,"Been to Birdpark over 15 years back. Today I brought my wife who has never been there. The exhibits are the same. The variety is so few. This is an ok place for people who have never seen birds like if you stay in a city or desert. Many species are lacking such as birds of paradise, kiwi, terns, turaco, bee-eater, peacocks, etc. A complete waste of time. Even for eagles there are so many varieties & species that we only saw 2 types lol. Not worth the $28 entrance fee. The tram ride is an extra $5 but you can take it inside going to the exit for free. The drinks are over-priced. The waterfall is fake with no birds. The birds are lifeless & zombie-like. Don't waste your time going to a far our place like Jurong. The CEO should be fired. Better off riding a bicycle at Gardens by the Bay ...."
,,Not as as shown on pictures,3.0,,This place is nice but not as expectations built on seeing its picture on media. If one visit one should not miss the shows.
,,Great place,5.0,,A definitely must visit spot for young childrens. they will enjoy a lot with a lot of different birds.
,,A good half day outing,4.0,,"No matter how much you plan and read the map before you go, you do get confused in these parks. My advice would be to make it for the two morning shows - 10.00 & 11.00 am.Do the tram ride post that. We ended up reaching at 10.30 and immediately followed the herd to stand in the tram line, which was long at that point. Ended up missing the 11 am show also and had to wait all the way till 3 pm for the High Flyers. Had no energy to wait to see the next show at 4 pm. So go early, catch the shows first, and then you are free to wander around. The park is not too big, and can easily be covered in a half day. I found the souvenirs here reasonably priced compared to other tourist attractions. One word of caution - if you feed the lories at Lory Loft, be sure your child is wearing sleeves. The bird are a little heavy and flock down on the person holding the nectar. My daughter got a big scratch on her shoulder. May be an interesting experience, but not my idea of fun. Also, don't miss the breeding & research centre to see for yourself how they help hatch and care for young birds. All in all, a pleasant experience."
,,Interesting World of Birds,5.0,,A good place for Kids as well as Adults. You get to see the Birds up close and personal. The place is a big one so for Family with Kids I would recommend that you take the Stroller or Wagon for Rent at the Entry point. Please do not miss the Birds Show. Also please take the Tram Ride which will help you move faster within the Park. If possible go on Weekday to avoid crowd
,,Beautiful and leisurely,4.0,,Booked this trip while there and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Take a camera - you don't want to miss the shots you can get. The monorail is a bonus for foot sore/weary trippers. One not to miss.
,,OK to miss this one,3.0,,"The Bird Park experience for us was meh! Sure you can see lots of different birds, but after having visited the Zoo the previous day, we weren’t too impressed with the park. One can get discounted tickets in combination (Zoo + Bird Park) so if you take that option it’s not a bad place to go."
,,Must for small kids,5.0,,"This is a place which kids will love. So if you have small children they are going to love this place. So many pretty birds, Penguins. Must go."
,,Beautiful Place To See Birds & Bird Shows,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a beautiful bird park which houses flamingos, penguins, and birds from across the world. You can start with a train ride which takes you around the park and then walk around the park. They have a special dark zone for Owls.

They conduct two shows, in one, they tell you about the big birds like the eagles, vultures and the likes. The gentleman who conducted the show seemed to be well learned about the birds. The second one at the Amphitheater is an entertainment filled show of birds like parrots and the likes. The lady who hosted the show was an amazing entertainer along with her team. The show ended with a beautiful parade of various birds.

Great time for my teenage kid learning about birds and being entertained by them."
,,Just Amazing,5.0,,Singapore seems to be doing things better than anyone when it comes to this type of experience. The birds are as close to free as you can get in a well maintained park.
,,Super Experience!!,4.0,,Seeing the different types of birds is a great experience.Good shows and Penguin feeding session is really great!! Children will enjoy it thoroughly.
,,Visit if you have kids with you or a lot of time at hand,3.0,,"The Jurong bird park is very beautiful and well maintained, however, I would not recommend the place if you are short on time or are a solo / couple traveler.
That is unless you are interested in birds and wildlife.

Firstly, it is very far from the airport or main city. Secondly, you cannot club this with any other place as there are no major attractions nearby.

The macaws were the highlights and if possible do try and attend the parrot show, it is very entertaining."
,,Beautiful experience,4.0,,"There is a lot to see here, be prepared to walk. Else opt a tram ride to get a glimpse of the place.
We witnessed High Flyers show and Kings of the skies. Both shows were hosted amazing and kept us looking for what's next.
Be early and choose a good spot for a good view. Else choose a seat close to exit as it gets very crowded and will take time to exit.
Do the tram ride in between the show timings else skip a show to beat the queue for tram ride."
,,Excellently maintained !!,5.0,,"Excellently maintained, went with my parents - the tram inside the park was very useful and it is extra 3-5 SGD only, don't miss the bird show.

Currently there is no direct MRT - but the work is in progress, would suggest to get a taxi or take a MRT and from that take a bus or Taxi

• Bugis EW 12 - Green Lane
• Final Station is Boon Lay EW 27
○ 15 Station Away (33 Mins)
• Take Exit D - Jurong Bird Park
○ Bus No. 194 or 251
From Boon Lay bus interchange"
,,Must see.....,5.0,,A super attraction for the kids and adults alike. Try to catch one of the many shows they have. Good for a couple of hours.
,,Children enjoy the variety of birds.......,4.0,,Great place to take the children for a fun experience - the range of birds is amazing. Bit out of the main tourist area but well worth the journey to Jurong.
,,a huge open bird park................,3.0,,"jurong is a huge open bird park where we can observe all sorts of birds in their natural habitat.
but i don't recommend it as a very nice place after seeing the zoo,river safari and night safari.
its not very interesting where you have to walk a lot despite of tram facility.
i feel it is money waste and moreover faraway from the city and you have to travel all the way long just for it....
its almost takes 30-45 min in a taxi from city center to reach there..."
,,Great collection of birds,5.0,,The collection of birds are great. You will fine more than 400 variety of birds. The park is spread over 22 arch. The park have free tram service also.
,,Great day out,4.0,,Fabulous assortment of birds to see . Great bird show. Only fault I would have is the food . We had a buffet - not a good selection and the food wasn't good . Overall had a great day
,,Amazing life of friends living in the skies..,5.0,,Fantastic place to visit in Singapore to understand the life of the creatures with the wings and the beaks.. The concentration of all the birds who freely roam around in the aviary makes your day soothing and helps rejuvenation.. Thought provoking for the folks who enjoy the life of birds.. The attention to minute things has actually caught my eye and I was awe about it.. Its a full day place.. Carry more water and enjoy the experience among the colourful creatures..
,,Amazing birdlife,5.0,,"this is a wonderful park to visit for all ages so many different birds with two shows wekk worth the visit, set in beautuful gardens there are places you can interact with the birds, good food outlets and clean toilets available"
,,Interesting ..!,4.0,,My Kid really enjoyed the Bird park and for the ambiance it had.. Situated outside the city and the transit is a main issue for this Park ..!
,,Great place to observe birds,4.0,,"My kid enjoyed it very much. Ability to feed them was amazing, so as the show in the amphitheater. Birds have relatively high freedom as they move freely. However, if they provide more space for birds of pray, this place would be perfect. Sad to see those giants in cages that won't allow them to move freely.
The children water play area is amazing. My kid played there till they closed it down."
,,Half day at Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"We spent the morning half of the day we were to return to India, at Jurong Bird Park... Try to get to the park by 8:30 or so, we could see only the High Flyers' show and missed the other one. The high flyers' show, lasting for about 30 mins, was excellent, to say the least! The park has a vast collection of birds in their natural habitats. Do visit the aviary loft & parrot paradise... The park however requires quite a bit of walking and you may wish to rent a stroller for the entire day at SGD 9 for your kid. You can also explore the park by tram, though you would miss out on viewing more than half the collection if you choose the tram. There's a pizza hut too inside the park! Good place."
,,Beautiful Experience,5.0,,"Lovely place. Both shows should not be missed. Lot of walking required, Minimum time required to cover whole place 4.5 hours including both shows."
,,A innovative way to get a closeup with lot of birds,5.0,,Be prepared for lot of walking if you really want to enjoy fullest of the Birds. Please refer to park timings as there are specific timings for Bird feeding and different sessions.
,,Great Day at Jurong bird Park,5.0,,"This is the 2nd time we have visited Jurong Bird Park they have a wonderful collection of birds and the grounds are nicely set out, our favourites is probably the Owls. The shows that they have are also very informative and enjoyable."
,,Superb Enjoyed Lot,5.0,,"i visited on January 2017 with my family on my holiday Trip Superb place , took many colorful photos"
,,Disappointed,2.0,,Compare the few year ..feel a bit disappointed. lack of bird..not organised. feel boring to visiting
,,Feast for bird lovers....but very humid place,4.0,,"Lovely place.
Highlights of the place:
Lory loft- where you can see free flying colourful parakeets very closely.
Waterfall aviary: very beautiful man made highest waterfall and adapting birds including a peacock that welcomes you at the entrance..

Suggestions:
shows: for best view, occupy the central lower seats if possible.
Clothing: very comfortable,, summer style clothing. Be prepared to be drenched in your dripping sweat.

Overall, a worthy place to visit. 4-5 hrs should be sufficient to cover both the shows and the highlights of the park."
,,Beautiful Park with Beautiful Birds !!!,5.0,,"A must watch for travellers to Singapore. While sentosa and US offers the artificial pleasures, this one is more attached to the natural way.
Beautifully maintained park , with kids friendly and family friendly options like battery operated cars , voice assistance on guiding throughout the Park etc etc. One should not miss the bird show at 11:30 and at 15:30. It's a great to watch. Overall , an excellent place to visit in Singapore."
,,Review of Jurong Bird park,5.0,,"Had received mixed reviews about this bird park but anyways decided to visit it. reached pretty late in the afternoon and was wondering whether the park would be closed by then.Luckily the park was open till 6:00 pm. From the MRT station we took a bus 194 which drops you at the park. At the ticket counter couple of parrots welcome guests. At the main entry there are penguins and once you reach inside there are varities of birds some of them which i have never seen before.The birds are caged in seperate categories like ""birds of prey"", ""pelican cove"" etc. There is a tram service available inside the park but am unsure about the ticket price. There are restaurants available serving South Indian and other cuisine. We spent almost one and half hour here and were very happy that we visited this park.

Also there is a beautiful waterfall inside and one can also view ostrich eggs and eggs of few other birds."
,,Fun Park though a little far away,5.0,,"Travelling to Jurong Bird Park is not an easy thing if you are taking public transport. There's no MRT station nearby but a few buses. However, the bird park is of lots of fun. The whole park is like a huge reserve because of hills, small lakes, and trees. You can also enjoy your meal with parrots (reservation needed)."
,,Worth the trip if you've done the other parks. Better than expected.,4.0,,"If you are a tourist and short for time, this should be your 3rd choice among the parks, after the Zoo and Night Safari.
A four-hour visit is quite enough to cover all the 'exhibits'.

The Lory Loft is perhaps the family favourite. Purchase the feed and the experience you get is worth the ticket price. There's a waterplay area for young ones. So bring a change of clothes if you are visiting with kids who can't resist getting wet.

Would we go again? Maybe in 5yrs time."
,,caged birds,4.0,,"Have a very good collection of birds but are caged birds only. People like birders, who want to see the birds in the natural environment like forests and wetlands will be a little disappointed."
,,Fun place to visit,5.0,,"Really lovely park to visit with plenty of birds to see. We caught the train from KL Sentral and then a connecting bus. Be aware that the bus seems to drop you off on a street but that is the Bird Park stop, just walk up the road slightly and you'll see the entrance!
The shows are excellent and definitely worthwhile catching. Beautiful park-like grounds and a good day out."
,,Relaxing and Exciting,4.0,,"Great place, well kept and friendly staff! Will definitely be back once we get the chance. Will also reccomend to friends."
,,Good shows,4.0,,"Good shows in King of skies and high flyers. Must visit the waterfall aviary. Team will be very crowded. Take a walk, it's not a huge place after all. Can cover leisurely in 3 hrs. Nicely maintained birds"
,,Don't Miss It,5.0,,Takes about an hour to get there on MRT/bus but is well worth the visit. Such lovely displays in a lush setting. Plan to spend the day here.
,,Family Visit to Bird Park,4.0,,"You may opt to go to the park just or near lunch time, so that you can cover all the birds with shows."
,,Amazing bird park,5.0,,I have never seen such beautiful bird park. You should visit this facility. They have a tram ride around the park. Must see the show High Flyers show. This is an amazing show done by different birds. You have a nice waterfall also in the area.
,,Great plan for a day,5.0,,"Went there planning to stay for couple hours however, ended up staying almost full day. They have a large variety of birds from the small and cute ones till the big and impressive like the Andes Condor. Plus the shows are good entertainment. Great family plan"
,,Family Attraction,5.0,,Everyone in the family can visit this attraction.Visit by 9.30 am .Take the map at the entrance of the park.Note down the timings of different shows they held and plan accordingly.For elders can use the free vehicle for one round inside the park
,,Once was good,2.0,,"Bought 4 park pass, but was disappointed by attraction. Seems to be lacking maintenance while they wait for new park to open. Tour buses seem to just concentrate on 2 shows then leave. Lorikeet exhibit was closed so really not much point coming"
,,Super experience!,4.0,,"Paradise for nature and bird-lovers. Super exciting experience for children is specific. Make sure you attend a scheduled show as they are truly spectacular. Worth the effort to get there and experience the birds. Personally love flamingos, ever since I've visited the park. It's a fun afternoon/day activity."
,,Another WOW!,5.0,,"The Bird park is amazing, You should definitely stay there from 11:30 AM to late in the afternoon, the show with Flamingos, Parakeets and other birds is definitely a hit with Kids as well as Adults. Must visit."
,,Truly impressive and they keep improving it.,5.0,,"This is one of the ""must see"" attractions of Singapore and truly worth the effort to get there. It has vastly improved over the years. Don't miss the shows."
,,Excellent man made forest-Bird Park,5.0,,"Man made forest, but you won't believe it. Congratulations to the architec and the team preserving it. Small water bodies everywhere inthe park. Variety of birds kept in the park including Penguines etc poler birds. Man made waterfall, one can't believe. One need whole day to soak in the park. Internal conveyance facility. Smallest concern of the tourist/visitor is taken care of. Everything is par excellence."
,,excelent,5.0,,"Fantastic place for children and adults. So close to nature, not so expensive. For sure worth to visit"
,,Fantastic but dedicate a whole day to it,5.0,,"My partner and I visited the Jurong bird park during a recent visit to Singapore. Established in 1971 this is the worlds largest bird park containing various bird species from all corners of the world. As a bird fancier I couldn't miss it. Had a great time but underestimated the size of the park and the time it would take to go through it. Here are a few tips for those planning a visit here.

1. Getting here - The Jurong Bird Park is located in the Suburb of Jurong, which is located in the west of Singapore - far away from the tourist epicentre. We went via the MRT. You get on the green east-west line to 'Boon Lay'. This will eject you in a large shopping centre. Walk through this to the bus terminal and get on bus number 194. This runs in a loop and from the station it will be your first stop. Do the same backwards (if you miss catching the bus at the stop you were dropped off at you can walk under the highway to the opposite side of the road). Unfortunately getting here via the MRT takes quite some time - we spent around 1.5 hours each way from our hotel room on orchard road before we got into the park.

2. Cost - To purchase a ticket for Jurong it is 29 (adult), 19 (child) and 13 for a senior citizen. For what you get this is good value

3. Food - There is two restaurants at the entrance to the park but both are quite overpriced as you would expect.

4. Weather dependent - The bird park is almost exclusively located outside which can be a problem with singapores often passing rainshowers.

5. Shows - There are a few shows but one that i would absolutely recommend is the 'King of the Skies' show which displays birds of prey such as vultures, flacons, eagles and hawks.

6. Time - This is where I really got it wrong. You really want around 4-5 hours in the park to cover everything. You will be surprised just how much stuff there is to do. When combined with significant travel times on the MRT you want to dedicate a whole day of your holiday to this bird park rather than thinking you can fit it into a half day slot.

Overall I had a really good time here and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending it to others."
,,very cool place,5.0,,"very very well made, collection of exotic birds that you can feed see n get fascinated..do visit when in singapore"
,,A must go for every age,5.0,,Very well maintained place. They have very nice shows which are not to be missed. Staff is cooperative. Lots of walking but worth it when you see the extinct birds are being taken good care
,,Fun trip for kids,4.0,,"Its a good half day trip. Give it a full day if you polan to walk all the exhibits. there is a wet park for kids, so do take pool wear, change of clothes and towel as appropriate...do not miss the parrot show at 11 am and 3 pm."
,,Fun,5.0,,"It's a must visit if you're in Singapore, you'll get to see a lot of new stuff. The bird shows are excellent."
,,Must visit place with Kids ....,5.0,,lift time experience to see lots of variety of Birds. Here you can experience -- feeding @ lorry loft and singing parrot at bird show .
,,One of the best bird park in the world.,5.0,,One of the must visit attraction. Pl buy Park Hopper tickets as it will save money. Value for money attraction.
,,Nice show kids enjoyed,5.0,,Different birds different bread nicely maintained.free birds we saw some free moving chemlion we took photos with him
,,Very Interesting,4.0,,We took a taxi from our hotel as we didn't want to do this on a tour. It took about 1/2 hour to get to the bird park and we paid to go on the tram it is well worth the $5.00 as you get to go around the park and see what there is them you can walk to the different areas. The waterfall area is lovely as is the rest of the bird park and the entertainment is well worth seeing. This is good for children. We had a lot of school groups the day we were there. You can get on and off the tram and do different areas.
,,Superb Place to Visit,5.0,,This place is a must for one day trip in Singapore The place is wheel chair accessible. we booked the park hooper passes online as it offers discount of 15% online.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We enjoyed the bird show, and took photos with them. It's a great place to bring kids here, they'll learn a lot about the world."
,,THE BIRD SHOW IS A MUST WATCH,5.0,,"Really loved Jurong, the more time you stay, the more you fall in love with the place. Loved the Bird Show"
,,Nice Bird's park,5.0,,A nice park with so many beautiful colourful Birds!!! Must visit place with children!!! Try the train service for the whole park visit but also walk to explore more!!!
,,Go early to beat the crowds,4.0,,"Getting there and back: take bus #194 from Boon Lay Bus Interchange berth B8, and you alight outside the park. Coming back, you can take the bus from the same bus stop as it is a loop service.

Tips:
1) Go EARLY (i.e. be there at 8.30 am) to view the birds in relative peace and quiet. It gets packed by afternoon
2) If you intend to feed the lories at Lory Loft, the park sells a small cup of nectar water ($3 each - prepare exact change) which will attract them. However, go in the MORNING as the birds will be too full by afternoon, and will ignore you
3) F&B is available but overpriced. You can stock up necessities at Jurong Point, the shopping centre next to Boon Lay MRT
4) Wear comfortable shoes as the park is on hilly terrain. Also bring mosquito repellent. Most of the park is in the open with no shade
5) The majority of the birds are caged up, and you won't be able to take clear photos. Manually focusing with a long telephoto lens will help blur cage lines"
,,Great place,5.0,,"Loved the bird park. Had a lovely Laksa at food outlet before taking the train around the park. So close to all the birds, lots of photo opportunities.

We had been 6 times to Singapore before but never thought about going here as thought it would be ""ordinary"". Fantastic exhibits and the Bird Show at 3pm not to be missed.

Can't say too much here as will give it all away.

Very enjoyable"
,,Great birds!,4.0,,"In order to see all the beautiful exotic bird, you need to walk the park. Do not take the trolley as you will not see much. Most of the tourists are taking the trolley so they do not walk the 1.5 km. You must walk it. Outside of the main entrance which is commercial, the rest of the park is calm. I recommend you see part of the bird show but leave before the end to start the walk before the tourists."
,,Amazing place,4.0,,"Arrive at the time of gates opening and spend atleast till 3-4 pm. Keep the leaflet or the map of the park while entering the park. Note down the show/event timings and accordingly arrive at the place 10-15 mins early. Sit right in the middle of the stage. Best for kids aged 8 and above. Lot of walking is required. Do not bother to try the tram, you cannot see the park in detail."
,,Nice park,4.0,,"Went to Bird park couple of days ago with parents . It was a cloudy day . Still went ahead . Reached by 8.30 that's when they open . Not much crowd when we entered . There are two shows @ 10 and 11 .
By the 10 am show crowds started coming in . We did the tram ride as we entered . So not much crowd . Post the shows noticed that tram queues were big as well . Both the shows were good . 11am one was the best . We were lucky that the rain gods were away during the show time .
After the shows took a walk around and exited by 12.30-1 pm.
Must visit if u have enough time in singapore"
,,Amazing place to see all kinds of Birds...,5.0,,Jurong Bird Park is one of the place which one must go specially if there are kids. This park has Huge variety of colourful birds and one can enjoy with family watching these birds. The park has 2-3 birds show in their amphitheatre which is a must see.
,,Brilliant bird shows,5.0,,Great fun and amazingly trained birds in shows. Treat for kids in water parks. In fact my parents also enjoyed
,,Interesting,3.0,,"We enjoyed our visit but the overall feeling was one of claustrophobia, probably exacerbat d by the humid conditions. Feeding the lorys was fun and the birds are spectacular close up. As a keen naturalist I was sad to see the birds caged."
,,Brilliant place to see,5.0,,"Whattay place. The bird show twice a day is a must see. It is astonishing as to how birds interact with humans and remain calm given the right kind of environment. The lorikeet feeding session is awesome not to be missed at any cost. The iguanas of different colours raining around freely, penguin coast, the man-made 100 feet waterfall, pelican cove, flamingos, ostriches. OMG a treasure trove of birds. Such a treat to the human eyes and mind."
,,One of it's kind in the world,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is the largest walk-in aviary, the Waterfall Aviary that houses over 600 birds as well as a 30-metre high waterfall. There is an entrance fees to it but worth visiting this place with good camera. You will get an opportunity to click amazing clicks here while you are walking in this aviary, especially during their feeding time ( make note of it and plan your tour accordingly. Do not miss the amazing King of the Skies shows and also the world’s largest, the 9-storey high Lory Loft, the biggest lory flight aviary. It is located little outside the city, therefore you may have to board the public bus service or hire taxi to reach the park"
,,very educative for the entire family,5.0,,"never visited a better bird park. only sad part was to see some birds in small cages. i wish they could house all birds in big enclosures. such a huge variety of birds. the shows are also good. it has a very good children water park. however swim wear is needed, so carry it along. they sell swimwear for 20 SGD! Tram should be included in ticket price the way it is in night safari. these are essentials for older folk and families with young children. its not a value added service. But just like elsewhere in Singapore, its money that matters and not customer satisfaction."
,,Wonderful flying critters,4.0,,"Took a train to Boon Lay station (has a shopping centre there so you can stop and get snacks/lunch etc) then caught the local 194 bus to Jurong Bird Park - takes 10 mins and costs S$3.20 return. Cheap as chips.

Get there as early as possible - it gets real hot in Singapore and the crowds at the bird park build up as time goes on. When you've had enough and want to come back, just wait at that same bus stop as the bus does a little u-turn and takes you back to the station. Simple!

Entry to the Park is rather pricey at S$29 each, but one doesn't mind if the birds are loved and looked after. Personally I found some of the cages rather small for the larger birds but they all seemed very well cared for.

One of the major frustrations for me was the width of the wire on the cages. Most were too close together to get decent photos of the birds (I draw and paint them later so decent photos are important).

There's a very staged bird show which those who aren't around birds much may enjoy. I didn't mind it but my partner wasn't too thrilled.

Best part was coming across a pond where a staff member was feeding night herons and a rather shy jabiru. They could all fly off if they chose so I had uninhibited access to photograph the birdlife in its natural environment. Happiness plus.

Loved the lizards, squirrels, hornbills - well, pretty much everything really. Staff all seemed very pleasant although we didn't have a lot to do with them.

HINT - Wouldn't go on a weekend if you can help it - the crowds would be truly nasty."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This was so much more than only a Bird Park! Loved the bird show, the Waterfall and the tropical Gardens. Much bigger than expected! Get extra Tram ticket and take tram the top of park and then walk back down. Loved it all!"
,,Fun place specially with kids,4.0,,"We were lucky to be there on a cloudy day, thanks to the tropical climate. Good bird shows specially the one with vultures is classic."
,,Well maintained with a wide variety of birds,4.0,,"The main issue we have with this attraction is the sun. Might be a plus point for some tourists out there but not for me. You can check the bird show schedules, take part in feeding activities (payable) or simply enjoy the park at your own pace. Bring umbrellas as they are good for both the sun and potential rain."
,,Nice park!,5.0,,You can visit the park when the weather is fine. 4-5 hours are enough for this attraction. There are 2-3 shows which are entertaining. Some rare bird species are there. Take a map so that you dont get lost. Other things whcich you can carry are umbrella and water bottles.
,,Wide variety of birds and a nice park for a family,5.0,,"There were a lot of variety of birds here which is nice to see. I like the fact that the zoo is also a sanctuary so the birds were not really there in cages for profit but you can see that they are being taken care of. I was expecting though for a big aviary wherein visitors can go inside and mingle with birds. Although they have that, it was only for a limited type of birds. They also had nice bird shows which is great for kids."
,,Very good place,4.0,,Very good experience for the kids. We all enjoyed the shows and they had some interactive stations which my kids enjoyed. There is a breeding and research station where my son was able to watch with wonder a tiny just hatched tiny baby bird being feed with a tiny syringe.
,,Only meant for the kids,3.0,,The Jurong Bird park is a must visit bird park for the kids. The adults wont like it so much. The park has many beautiful birds all around. They host bird shows on timely intervals as well.
,,its a good idea to move,3.0,,"It's really an amazing place to watch birds in flight.

As I learned that they are planning to move the park to mandai, we decided to give it a visit.

In my opinion, it is a good decision to move. As we are walking around the park, we could smell funny scents coming from the nearby factories.

and while watching one of the bird shows, we can hear car and motorbike sounds from the back.

But I still love the attraction, the beautiful nature!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,We visited this bird park in SIngapore in April 2017. The park has many beautiful birds with rich colours. The bird shows in the park is worth to watch.
,,Too Good - Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,Easy connectivity by MRT and then the bus. Kids love it. You get to see a lot of birds here. Some of the enclosures take you right in the middle of beautiful birds and butterflies. Visited in end of April 2017. Its a good place to be even if it rains. The shows are excellent. Amazing to see how the birds perform.
,,Great fun and learning experience,5.0,,Place full of greenery and birds of all species in their natural habitat. Enjoy the place by reaching early morning and take a round inside the park in the Tram. Their 2 bird shows are must watch and plan your walk inside in a manner so as to reach the show venues before time. Complete the day with a visit to River safari in the afternoon and Zoo in the evening.
,,Great Place,5.0,,"Had a great time here lots to do and see it is on a hill , we found it easer using the tram to get around

Bird show was good

We did visit the restaurant but the bus came early to take us back so did not get a chance to taste it's delights but did look nice"
,,Must visit,4.0,,Jurong bird park is unlike any zoo - here birds are free and looks really happy in enjoying the natural surroundings and so do the visitors. Zoo is generally a depressing place but jurong bird part and bird show are a must visit for anyone visiting Singapore.
,,Good,5.0,,This park is fulled with lot of Bird. Don't miss the Bird Show as it's so enjoyable. The Photo session with Birds gives u good memorable thing in u r life
,,1 time visit,2.0,,This one is not as good as singapore zoo. it would be good to see all the shows where you will be able to see all the birds and enjoy the acts instead of seeing them in their enclosure
,,Decent experience,3.0,,They have tried to do something good with exotic and trained birds along with conservation. Its a good place for kids. Don't go with high expectations and it's fun. The shows are also worth seeing as they demonstrate ability of different trained birds.
,,Very Good for Bird Lovers,4.0,,Jurong Bird park has good collection of Birds. There are 2 shows in the park which are a must see. Kings of the sky and High Flyers show. Had a great time with family and kids.
,,Amazing Bird Park,5.0,,"Jurong has the most amazing collection of birds I have ever seen. Tucans Hornbills Pelicans Cranes, you name it. My kid thoroughly enjoyed the Penguin feeding. The High flyers and Kings of the Skyes shows are must sees and should not be missed. The park also has a water play area for the kids but remember to pack your swimwear for that. The water fall aviary is equally amazing. There is tram availble too but the park is best seen by foot."
,,"Quite ok to spend time, trained birds",4.0,,"Compare to other attractions, this park is ok. Park ticket and Inside battery car ticket are separate. Don't miss two bird shows."
,,Flights of fancy,5.0,,With so much to see and do in Singapore this is well worth adding to the list of must do attractions. The park is well laid out and the scheduled shows are well worth attending. The website provides suggested morning and afternoon tour plans that make your experience of the park more worthwhile. The variety of birds is amazing.
,,Somethng beyond a zoo,5.0,,Very large variety of birds. The space and environment provided for birds is much larger and better than a typical zoo cage. Good for photography lovers.
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,"Overall a good trip, one can take the tram to go around.One can pre-book through klook which was bit cheaper than over the counter.The park is well maintained, you have to be early at 8.30 as the park closes at 5.30."
,,"Fantastic place, fantastic birds",5.0,,It was really eye opening to tour the park and see all the different birds and we did enjoy the raptor show very much.
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"We loved it amongst all the attractions in Singapore. We went there with our 2 yr old daughter she also loved it.
We watched 2 shows there, do not miss the shows, they are awesome.
Travelled by MRT and a bus. Travelking was hassle free.
So many different birds we spotted, just loved it.
My daughter loved the penguins. She went to see them thrice.
Must see if you are with young kids."
,,Good place to visit specially for kids,4.0,,It was a great day out for us with two small kids. They have bird shows also. First take the tram ride to get some idea about the park. Collect a map at the gate which will have information about the park as well as different shows. They have a children play area as well. Carry swimming costume for your kids if they like to play with water.
,,Could not found places for childerns encounter with Birds as shwon in advertisments,1.0,,"I visited Jurong bird park on 23.04.2017. Overall it was good trip. However, I Could not found places for children's encounter with Birds as shown in advertisements everywhere? My kids were so disappointed. Photographers were charging 25SGD for one photo involving contact with birds. Also person at children's water play park did not allowed my daughter to play since she dint had proper swimsuit and other children were playing without swimsuit. where the rule for requirement of swimsuit is it written in the ticket?"
,,Well Maintained Bird Park,4.0,,"The Jurong Bird park is a well maintained bird park, you've to be there early in the morning it opens i presume at 8:30, closes at 5:30, we took a photograph with thee birds, as a momento, birds most of them are kept in the open, don't touch them i would say, our tickets included a tram ride, we first went on tram witnessed the flamingos , later took a walk , it was a good experience."
,,Fantastic Day Out,5.0,,"If you are or aren't interested in our feathered friends either way it's a great day out. Easy to get to using the metro, amazing birds, fantastic shows to watch which showcase different species and areas to go into where the birds are flying around. Was thoroughly enjoyed by the whole family. Great place and well looked after. Also if you can take a bag with swimming clothes there is a small water park area for the kids to cool down in."
,,Not worth money and time,3.0,,"This is far from the city center and other attractions. I had high expectations on this, but was disappointed with variety of birds as compared to KL Bird Park, which is a walk-in Aviary. It is a really poor by Singapore standards, and would have rated that way except for the water play area for the kids."
,,do so many birds even exist,5.0,,well they do....and the multiple colours in each bird family is an eye-opener to the amount of work and intricacy that has gone into building one of the worlds finest bird sanctuaries. Take your kids for a full day trip. They will know much ore about birds vis-à-vis their syllabus
,,So-so,4.0,,"I was a little disappointed, the Lorikeet area closed for some repair work, all the birds didn't look too happy in general. Not as interesting as I thought it will be, they need to spice it up a little."
,,Beautiful Singapore Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"Good place to visit when you are in Singapore.
Many different kinds and varieties of birds in the park.
Wonderful experience to watch a parrot singing Happy Birthday and other songs, we enjoyed the bird shows very much.
We also enjoyed the buffet inside the park.
A ""Must"" to visit for your whole family while in Singapore."
,,Dont miss,4.0,,"If you visit SG, you must visit JBP. It is a must visit. The variety of birds is mind numbing. Don't miss the bird shows."
,,great day,5.0,,"great day at the park, large selection of birds, nice show. it may be sliperies when raining. i loved the pink floyd, it was really nice, the bird show is quite good too"
,,Great Park but lack dining option,3.0,,"This is not the first time we visited this park. We enjoy this park, specially its good to introduce young children to the many different birds.

The park is organized by sections, depending by the kind of birds. Its size is quite extensive, so if you go with young children, I suggest you take the tram ride. Also dont forget your sunblock!!

It is a great park, even for adults.

I gave the park a 3 stars because it lacks of dining option. When we visited the park, the only option is only at the entrance of the park, or the buffet option inside the park.

The fact that a restaurant is located at the entrance minimized you to dine at you own convenient time, either you eat before or after you tour the park, although this dining place have good selections.

The buffet option however give yourself the convenient timing to dine according to your liking, it also have option for dinining with bird show, which is fun for the children. But the food in this place is really bad, food is bland, selection is limited. Fruit, ice cream, and coffee is available.

I woul not recommend to dine here if you do not intend to entertain your children with the bird show."
,,Good - could be better,4.0,,"I was here 30 years ago, and my memories were of a low commercial group of aviaries where one could view different species of birds. It's now very commercialized, with rides and shows. The most annoying part -- a sponsorship by the Smurf movie series, which leads to thousands of plastic Smurfs being placed among the exhibits. We saw more Smurfs than birds, and it was too distracting.

The best experience was the Penguin feeding -- not many people so we were able to interact with the trainer (and the penguins)"
,,Exciting place with kids,4.0,,Very wonderful experience to visit this park. My kid enjoyed a lot. The bird show was interesting & we enjoyed the trum ride also. This park is accessible by MRT-bus from town; however it's convenient & time worthy to use taxi. There is a Pizza Hut inside the park.
,,A must visit place in Singapore,5.0,,"I had been with my family had wonderful experience birds are from all over the word and kept in the fantastic natural environment. They also have a small kid water park one must carry swimming constume. We were able to see two bird shows both were live and the birds were flying amongst the viewers . The show conductors have involved volunteers From the spectators made the show more live.

We had two wonderful experience my daughter fall down and got little injury the first aid guy Mr Harman near the kid water play area immediately done the first aid and she got great relief from pain .

Other my daughter forgot the the camera at higher flyer show which was deposited by one Ms Diana the housekeeping gye guided us to Visitors Service Point who returned us the bag after confirmation of the belongings.

Such a wonderful and amazing experience in my first foreign tour realy love the country and it's honest people"
,,A fun day for the kids,4.0,,"Visited the Jurong Bird Park on a public holiday in Singapore. Very very crowded but only at the entrance, once we entered the park is big enough to accommodate everyone except for the tram rides. There were long queues for the tram ride around the park but the wait was not long.

Many many different types and varieties of birds. Kept the kids entertained. Colourful birds too. Lory loft was temporarily closed when we visited so didn't get to enter to feed the birds or walk on the bridge there.

Kids spent the last part of the day at the Kidszone wet playground. Area had a dry and wet playground. Kids absolutely love the wet playground which has a huge bucket of water which would periodically pour down on them. The playground also has some youth employed by the park to play or look out for the kids.

Missed the bird shows as it was heavily raining in the afternoon. Few restaurants in the park and a kiosk operated by Pizza Hut. It's called Pizza Hut Express so they may not have a full menu. Can't say more since I didn't patronise the kiosk.

Overall, it was a very enjoyable trip and kids with iOS be very happy there."
,,A Must Visit when in Singapore...,4.0,,The Bird Park is beautiful and well managed. Lot of shows and experiences are held for the entertainment of the guests and every one of them is worth attending. The birds are beautiful. The walk between the polys which are a part of the experience is lovely. A Must visit when in Singapore.
,,Day out,5.0,,Wonderful experience with birds Highlights are the bird shows Enjoyed feeding birds Just nice for a one day trip
,,Great Show,4.0,,"Made our own way to Bird Park via MRT and bus from Clarke Quay cheapest way and easy. Everything is well written to understand and trains are so frequent longest wait was 3 minutes coming from Sydney where we're used to 15min +.

Bird Show was fantastic. Got up close to a Toucan. Beautiful waterfall near the end of the park, lovely photo opportunities.

Extremely hot day, water stations were great. Bought a fan with water which made kids happy.

Lots of different birds from around the world.

Great day. Took approx 2 1/2 hours.

Had Pizza Hut for lunch."
,,Wow Bird Park,5.0,,"Its worth visiting place. Atleast you need 4-5 hours to see the entire park. Plan your visit according to the shows happening in the park. Don't miss the bird shows, its entertaining.

You will fall in love with Flamingos and parrots.

Use tram to save your energy. If you have kids less than 4 years old please take trolley of your choice."
,,excited,4.0,,its was an unforgetful experience with the birds around and the sound of them keep me peace and relax
,,Was ok,3.0,,Im not a bird fan to start with but our 14yo is so this was his pick. Birds in cages... some open aviaries but 1 was closed when we went. Decent variety of birds. Lots of hills and steps but there is tram that goes around if you have trouble walking but still some steps to tackle. And u pay extra for the tram but not much. Very damp place due to the tropical area etc and lots of mosquitos. Was a very hot day and not a lot of areas to cool off. We wouldn't go back if we visited again and even our 14yo said the same. Lots more interesting and fun things to do in singapore.
,,Jurong Park is awesome,5.0,,"Plenty of birds from all over the world, different colors/sizes. Bird Shows. Visit via tram rides is best. Carry lot of water as you have to walk"
,,Great Bird Park Experience!,4.0,,"Excellent self arranged trip. Easy taxi ride from the hotel.
Get on/off tram ride around the park for the less energetic. Easy walking everywhere. Great for kids. A very good live bird show in the amphitheatre.
Well worth the trip. Sometime this year it is being relocated to the Zoo."
,,Amazed,4.0,,"Years ago during our first visit, it was boring... And we never stepped in again till 5years later today.
While looking for Easter Fun activities with kids, I spotted smuff Easter egg hunt happening at JBP.
We reached at around 11am, but car park is full(public holiday), we ended up having our lunch elsewhere and returning at 1pm. By then we are able to enter carpark.
We spent most of our time in queue, waiting and waiting. There's a big crowd for purchasing their entrance & tram tickets. We thought that's the only 1 that we have to wait. But no, we had to wait for tram(Long queue). And finally we hopped in to tram and its start to rain. We couldn't get off at any stations( our mistakes- no umbrella, no raincoat), this is a must! We return to main station and get our day pass converted to annual pass (promo pay $29 a day can convert to a year). And is such a mess system, we are required to queue again. After done rain stopped, and we queue again for tram! We reach smuff waterfall aviary station at 3:45pm. Reaching the activities station at 3:50pm, and being informed ""sorry that we are closed for the day"". Such a disappointment that they closed at 4pm and it's only happening for 3days. Waterfall aviary is beautiful, we enjoy our walk and scenery there. So far we visited penguin, parrot and we stranded at pelican cove( raining again). We have yet to watch any shows. However, this park is beautiful, although our visit is a waste... By queues, rains... Their nature is fascinating, we will make use their annual pass to visit again! And next time, will be visiting with their free teaching resources for my preschoolers."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,U will find here birds around the world at this place. Few birds are kept inside the cage while many are kept open where u can see them very closely. Wonderful experience. Wonderful Place.
,,Enjoyable for kids,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is definitely a must see for kids when in Singapore. It isn't a massive park and can be done in a leisurely manner.
Kids would get to see different species of birds not to mention the 2 main shows that are repeated in the morning/ evening.

10am show is a bit too early and can be shifted to 10:30 with subsequent one moved to 11:30.

Do note that you should bring swimmers, towel and change of clothes for the kids as there is a nice water play area which all kids enjoy to the hilt."
,,FANTASTIC PLACE TO VISIT,5.0,,We caught the local transport right to the gates and bought tickets when we arrived there. This is an absolutely beautiful place to visit and we saw the bird show which was wonderful. Well worth a visit
,,Very good place must visit,5.0,,"Jurong bird park is very good place to spend a day with family. It has variety of birds from small to large ones. I recommend to take tram tickets so that you can know which one you can start with. The whole bird park is not that huge but walking can be tiresome since Singapore is very hot and humid. The whole park would take approx 5 hours including meals as well. You also get to see man made waterfall and aviary. Don't miss the shows. They are awesome especially king of skies and high flier show. Also the best time i enjoyed was with parrots. There are variety of parrots and it was fun with them. If you go early morning it will be really good. I went at afternoon and reached there at 2.
Regarding reaching to this park you can take taxi from city but if someone wants to go via MRT they can do that as well. Just take MRT and get down at boon lay station.From there take 194 bus and it will directly take you to the park. I went via MRT."
,,Hot!,3.0,,"April is probably not the best month to travel to the bird park. It was hot and the steep walking trails with a large pram can be tiring.
The birds themselves are well laid out and would be interesting to many. The flamingos and the ibis are beautiful
A half day well spent"
,,Best Park in Singapore,5.0,,"It is incredible how this place has landscaped such a beautiful location in a city. It's not easy to get to but totally worth it. Unfortunately, the bird park is moving in 2020 to be next to the zoo. It's tragic because the current location is magic. It has the highest manmade waterfall and aviary in the world."
,,birds lovers,5.0,,A lot of different kind of birds.... the best place to visit the green and very clean city of Singapore. very well organized city and places. safe place for tourist. taxi drivers are very friendly. a lot of easy transport facility to move around. excellent place.
,,Good place to visit.,4.0,,"Even though Bird park quite far away from the city center, it is worth a visit. Plan to reach early so that you can catch all the shows during the first half of the day and can easily finish seeing the park by 2-3 PM.

We traveled by the MRT and then took a bus from the Boon lay bus interchange, Bus No. 194 drops you right outside the birdpark.

Lory Loft where one can feed the birds was a different experience. The birds are very friendly & if lucky you can have one perched on your hand or shoulder."
,,Walking with the birds,4.0,,"It is birthday trip for my 5 years old nephew. He enjoyed see the birds shows and different species of the birds. Unfortunately at the children play, which is the pool that we forgotten to bring his swimming trunk that he cant play with water. He is upset with it. For parents or aunties/uncles that wan the kids to have a memorable time in the zoos, remember their swim suits"
,,Nice to see but dont if afraid of hurt,4.0,,Nice to see the birds in there and experience on feeding the parrots by yourself but make sure to bear with pains due to bird's crawl
,,Click ! Click & click ...,5.0,,"Get good photos, like a Natgeo photographer. Birds sit on you to take photo. Get a good camera , get a set of lenses and you are on your trail to be no 1 bird photographer ! Best of luck--- visit it !"
,,Smurfs in the park,4.0,,"It was raining when we visited the place early morning. The park was currently having a Smurf event until end of the month at the waterfall area. One could take the tram to third stop or walk there. Besides having 300 smurf figures around the place, there was also egg hunt, egg decoration activities for kids to enjoy.
A tab difficult to take photos of the birds such as parrots in the cages.
Limited choices of eateries inside the park."
,,Amazing bird life,4.0,,"The grounds are beautiful, the birds spectacular, the shows cheesily entertaining. Great day with kids."
,,Awesome it is,5.0,,Huge varieties of animals. One can checkout Pengiuns too here. Bird shows were simply marvelous. Spent 5 hours.
,,"Wide variety , nicely maintained",5.0,,"Wide variety of birds, informative and nicely maintained. You have to walk a lot, there is tram available but it is recommended to walk through park to not miss anything. Best place for kids. Check timings of shows and plan accordingly. Visit park as early as possible."
,,Must visit for great interaction with birds,4.0,,"Another jem of a place in Singapore to interact & learn a bit about the animal kingdom, which we city dwellers have no time for. To see them up close & touch them at times can be very exciting esp for the kids.
If you are travelling with kids remember to take the tram & pay for it in advance. The same goes if you visit the zoo.
Also at the bird park try to reach early & watch as many shows as possible. It's the best way to learn & interact with the birds.
All exhibit areas are worth visiting, in certain areas some birds are in open walking with you.
The new bird park coming up near the zoo is supposed to be even better."
,,Caged birds,3.0,,Whilst a serious attempt has been made to present these birds sympathetically it is a little sad to see majestic birds in cages that are really not large enough for some of the larger vultures and eagles etc. Children will probably love the smaller birds flying free which can be fed by hand on the walkways. This bird park. Bird shows are given throughout the day and at feeding times and will keep the kids entertained
,,Fun and learning with birds..,5.0,,"Another must visit in Singapore. I found the park really interesting for two reasons, first you get to see a lot of rare birds and more importantly the park gives the message of conservation that I believe would make our children more aware and sensitive to the importance of the same. Plan the visit as follows, reach there by 9 am and see the shows, starting with the eagles, penguins and the main bird show. The take the tram to go around the park, Finish the tram and then take a walk around the park. Plan around 4 hrs for the visit."
,,Kids will love it,5.0,,Really enjoyed the place. It was very hot so mostly travelled with tram. We paid 100$ for professional photographs and they gave softcopy of 100s of snaps across all the areas. Allocate 3-4 hours for this. We reached early so that we can do more for the day. Keep drinking water and refilling bottles. Not so great food.
,,Too many mosquitos,3.0,,"Admittedly we went during the rainy season (uhm... yeah, I know) but there were too many mosquitos and we all came out massacred. The birds are interesting, but it's too expensive for what you get."
,,very nice,5.0,,It's a nice place to visit and you get to see a huge range of bird species! There are also free shows that you can watch and the shows are very interactive! You get to take pictures with flamingos after the show.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a different experience and far better compared to the Singapore Zoo. There are many attractions like the birds of prey and birds of color shows as well as the various areas for posing with birds and the flamingoes and penguin areas. However the highlight is the Lorry Loft where you need to spend an hour atleast. They have so many colorful birds who fly and sit on you or try to peck at you. You get food for a very nominal price which you can offer and they come to you.
I have a way with birds so they came to me even without food and I was lucky. Do this if you enjoy nature and they also have photographers who will click you and make the entire experience enjoyable.
The only downside is the cost of printing of the photos which they should reduce as it is steep i.e 20 SGD per picture."
,,Amazing world of Wings,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is one of the place which one must go specially if your travelling with a kid.

This park has Huge variety of colourful birds and one can enjoy with family watching and knowing about these birds.

Jurong bird Park has an amphitheatre where various shows (High Flyer Show) are done... all performed by specially trained birds..

I loved the most was the Singing Parrot (Song in Three Languages) .

to reach this place we took combination of MRT + SMRT bus and was very comfortable

Note:- If travelling with a kid please take Baby Stroller."
,,Bird Paradise,5.0,,"I couldn't wait to go here and see the birds. It did not disappoint. I took the metro to the bus depot and then got on the bus and it was a short ride which left me off close to the entrance. Upon entry, I walked into an aviary and was captivated by the birds! I was interested in photographing them and I spent quite a bit of time in there.

Everything here is well taken care of. There is a tram, and I did ride it later into my visit. It makes 3 stops. I took it up to the aviary with the giant waterfall. Upon entering this you walk toward the waterfall. You also have the ability to get up high and view it from different vantage points. The birds are all flying around. There are some signs to identify what you are seeing. It was great. Very relaxing. There also is a snack bar here. I then walked outside and wanted to see the parrots. I couldn't believe how many beautiful parrots of all types and colors they had here. It was simply amazing. After viewing these birds, I walked past a pond with more birds, pelicans and such and all in all, it was a very peaceful place. I went on a weekday and it was moderately crowded. I certainly had enough space to myself to take pictures etc. It was really a great place and they provide a nice environment for the birds who all looked happy! I was so glad I made the effort to come here. Also a great place to video, and they have shows as well."
,,Now I know- bird shows are meant to see them in their natural behavior,4.0,,"Gone are the shows with parrot cycling, birds doing magic tricks, birds climbing stairs etc.. These are not their natural behaviors.

What we saw focuses on the natural capabilities of these birds. These include - Streamlining their body to pierce through the dense forest to find food, superb eye sight, sense of smell etc..

Strong conservation message for the kids too. Oh, I used to think that all penguins need to live in cold temperature. Apparently, the first bird we saw is the African penguin playfully wadding in the pool under the hot sun!"
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,The weather was bad on the day we travelled but even then we enjoyed seeing the birds. The waterfall is beautiful
,,Great experience,5.0,,Feeding the Lory birds and the hawk show were clearly the highlight. Great place for a picnic. We enjoyed some time in the kids park too.
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,The bird park is well laid out and maintained. Avoid the crowds by going during the week. If visiting Singapore this is a must visit site.
,,It was amazing!!,5.0,,"Had a fun time at Jurong Bird Park. There were so many types of bird and the customer service the business provide was amazing. They know the attraction every well and how to get around the park. They were also very friendly and kind towards me.
I will be visiting that place again!"
,,How many superlatives can I use?,5.0,,"I have bird books at home and I thought I seen most birds but our visit to the park made me think again. There were birds from all over the world, common and exotic and so close to you in their exhibits. They are just stunning. We had bought a 4 park pass and needed to keep on the move but ever minute was worth it. My only misgivings was the show, included in the tickets, which although demonstrating the skills of many birds it was lacking. Too flashy and o.t. staged."
,,We had seen this before about 12 years ago. Nothing great.,3.0,,Nothing has changed here since our last visit. May be okay for a first visit. More enjoyable for children
,,was better before,3.0,,"Before there was a monorail, seems some things are a bit outdated now, but still a big collection of birds, and lots to see"
,,Fantastic but limited bird park,3.0,,Jurong bird park has lot of parrots from all over the world. They offer a bird show where birds sing and show various tricks and then they have a 100 ft man-made waterfall which is beautiful to look at. They also have a small variety of other birds but the park still has a long way to go. In my opinion calling it a bird park is not justified and they can work on improvements. My recommendation is to opt for it as a side trip only if you have time.
,,"Lovely Aviaries, but a few problems",5.0,,"The layout means you have to visit everything in a circuit. Unfortunately if you go in the same direction as the tram (clockwise) this means you see the worst area first.
A number of depressing rather small enclosures made a bad start to our day. However things improved when we reached the Birds of Paradise display, always a pleasure to see them.
After a light lunch at the Lori aviary, we entered that, wanting to feed them, which we’ve done several times. We wanted to walk round first. To our surprise we found the loris gorging from an abandoned tub. As we approached they all flew off. I held the tub as I have in the past, and none would come near me! A staff member suggested I held it near a branch at arms length, this worked in a fashion, 2 loris did come.
We watched somebody else try to feed them, without success. Further from the entrance, I tried again, and this time 2 birds did come to us. The photographers came, and encouraged birds who liked them to come to us. We noted that the birds were more confident while the photographers were present.
Clearly visitors have upset the loris, who are now scared of getting close to them (read my previous review for a totally different experience). If you try to feed them, please don’t try to touch them, and stay very still, and wait for them to come to you; perhaps we can restore the pleasure they used to get from playing with visitors.
A further walk brought us to the Waterfall Aviary. Fantastic range of birds, some coming close and some in the distance; this is similar to seeing them in the wild.
And that ended our day, and we’d only had time to see and admire half the exhibits! And we didn't even see the shows, which we have enjoyed in the past.
Finally the practical points. Plenty of clean toilets. We had mango lassi from the curry shop (forget its exact name) before entering, it was excellent. Lunch at the Lori Aviary café was tasty, from a limited menu.
Walking for those with disabilities is good, with smooth pavements. Seats were available in places, but some areas lacked places to rest. Most seats are benches, making it more difficult to stand up. The tram might be difficult to enter for the disabled, it’s quite high off the ground, and lacks good handholds.
Overall, a very enjoyable day. Well worth a visit, however if I had to choose, I’d prefer a day at the zoo; slightly better conditions for the animals, and an even more amazing experience."
,,birders delight,5.0,,"another gem, beautiful collection of birds in a lovely setting. a wide variety. Dont miss the bird shows they'll make your day."
,,all birds from all over the world,5.0,,"this garden good for family and kids best time from morning until
afternoon . dont be late bacause you will be stuck on the garden no pepole and no taxi !!!! every body go home and we are waiting taxi on the high way more then one hours."
,,Awesome twosome with the Zoo,4.0,,"With Singapore Zoo and this, you have a packed two days at Singapore with kids thanking you for rest of the year."
,,Amazing bird park (voucher),4.0,,"Hi people, visited Singapore last month. Bird park is mind blowing.
Lovely system of management and care for the birds.
Exclusive species of birds, not easily found.
Do try the Macao show (holding them)

Unluckily our couple friend could not join us, have extra voucher for 2.
If anyone needs it, can contact. Shah- 7893799772"
,,Excellemt experience,5.0,,The bird show is the main thing here where lots of birds are displayed. Good for educational purposes and to become aware of nature.
,,A Great day out,5.0,,"I enjoy this better than the zoos etc. The large atriums are fantastic. Dont forget to be quiet and look around when oyu are ther, wou will see all sorts of hidden gems such as the native Mouse Deer etc. My only critcism is that the birds of prey need a bugger enclosure."
,,Excellent bird views,4.0,,Has a large variety of birds. The bird shows are a specialty which is the main crowd draw for the tourists
,,Lovely,5.0,,Truly an amazing place to be in.. fun shows that leave you spell bound.. the birds are very well cared for.. loved the whole ambiance
,,Great place for young and old,5.0,,"I managed to get there early as they opened and I had most of the place to myself for about an hour, The birds are beautiful, ther is a fair amount of walking to walk all around to see all the birds and is stroller and wheelchair friendly. There are spots where you can purchase food and drinks. Some of the exhibits were closed for renovation but I managed to see everything on show, Had to wait a few minutes for some of the birds to show their face but the wait was worth it. A camera is a must as with all the Singapore tourist attractions"
,,Not so good,4.0,,We were here 11 years ago and had a great time . This time was Not so good . The Monorail has been removed . The areas where you could feed the Starling's is still there but you can no longer purchase the Mealy worms to feed them . The Aviary that housed the Tropical storm has gone . The Park is still Good but is not as good as it was.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,An amazing bird park. Whether or not you do the tram does not make a difference. There are a few hills but it is a leisurely walk.
,,Awesome view of various species of birds,4.0,,"The best part of the attraction is when the trainers tell you more about the various species of birds and there are some 30 min shows each which was very interesting.

First take the bus/tram ride within the park and that will give you an idea of which areas you may want to visit and what speed.. It also has a 100 meter man made waterfall which is nice.

Kids will love it.

A must visit attraction."
,,Plenty to see and good shows,4.0,,We spent nearly a full day walking through the many enclosures of birds as well as seeing other animals. There are quite a few shows throughout the day so it could be advisable to plan the day if your intending to see all the shows.
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"We travelled from Orchard Road by MRT & bus, which is a very fast and cheap way to go. The cost of entry was $29 each which is good value. When we arrived we had missed the shows so we walked about the park for 2 hours. There is a huge variety of bird life and plenty of good walking space to get around. The facilities are clean and well maintained as were the variety of food outlets."
,,Must go,5.0,,"Wonderful open air aviaries, excellent bird shows. Half day well spent. Also go to Jurong gardens nearby."
,,A nice attraction,4.0,,Visited on a Sunday afternoon with two kids. Families with kids should take the tram otherwise it is a long walk. You can see a lot of different species. There are shows- do not miss them. Nice cafes inside and clean toilets. Overall recommend.
,,Asian Birds,4.0,,"Enjoyed my visit, as I am the owner of 2 parrots. The toucans were amazing and the grounds were beautiful. Quite a ways out of town, but worth the taxi ride if you love birds."
,,The return,5.0,,"I have visited the Jurong Bird park many years ago,and it was the first place I wanted to see on this visit. My recollections were realised to be correct,it is a wonderful place to visit and enjoy the birds. Watching the keeper in the free flight aviary counting the 800+ birds was a joy. There she was with a pencil paper and tidbits,ticking them off as she saw them,recognising each bird as an individual.A bit unfortunate that the weather cut the day a bit short but a must see for sure."
,,Even one full day might not be enough!,5.0,,This place is so beautiful and unique that even one full day might not be enough! Its good to plan for atleast one full day.
,,not worth the effort of travelling to,2.0,,The park is currently a little bit further from the centre than most other attractions and is going to be relocated in the next couple of years closer to the zoo. At the moment it is a trip to Jurong East metro then a taxi to the park. I paid for lunch with the birds as did two other families. The food was very poor both in quality and variation. The bird show was nothing that I hadn't seen before and only mildly entertaining. The park seemed a little unloved but perhaps this was because it was being relocated and the staff had lost interest.
,,Great Place to visit with Kids,5.0,,What an amazing place really lovely we decided to walk got really tired by the end but it was worth it the scenery is beautiful there is even a small waterpark inside. My boys loved running around the open spaces they loved the parrots feeding the Pelicans was fun. There is also a great waterfall not sure if it's natural but good place to snap some pictures. I'll Highly recommend going but check the weather and make sure you get there early the park is huge you'll need the whole day.
,,Fantastic nature park,4.0,,"Very good attraction for young children, with fun activities such as Lory Loft where you can feed parrots using honey. There are also rare birds such as the Bali Myna and Black-winged Starling in aviaries.
There is also Penguin Coast, the world's largest collection of penguins, Waterfall Aviary, a large collection of African Penguins, and Parrot Paradise, many enclosures with different species of parrots.
However,food and merchandise is overpriced. Overall, very very good except for pricing."
,,Poor Birds - no love there..,2.0,,"The poor birds, some looked so unkept was quite sad. The poor puffins were in a slimy dirty tank area with so much mildew on the glass window we could hardly see in and that was one of the main reasons for going to the bird park along with the owls - although the owls did seem to be happy and healthy looking! Many of the larger birds out in the open and very hot enclosures where 'hen pecked' and feathers out many had sores on them wasn't pleasant at all. We bought the 4 park pass along with the zoo, so we were quite looking forward to it and were in and out as quick as we could be as seeing the state of some of the birds - just wasn't nice. There didn't even seem staff to be around to even check on any as you would expect. The only heartwarming thing was we saw when we were leaving the park that it was moving in 2020 to the Singapore Zoo - that is the best idea and we will make sure we revisit the Bird Park when it is being looked after under the careful eye of the brilliant Singapore Zoo. Not much I can say except if you do go - don't expect much."
,,birdy,4.0,,birds here is so greaaaat. colourful. pinky bird flaminggo. so happy to be here!! have to visit when u coming to singapore
,,Good attraction,4.0,,"Beautiful park, with huge variety of birds.You can walk which I don't Recommended it is a crazy big park or take the train for extra $5.Get off at any station and walk around to see the species.My favorite was the colourful parrots.Take mosquito repellent I had a bad bite.Beatiful pictures.It far from the city take the MRT and then a bus but public transportation is amazing in Singapore very efficient.Dont miss the shows they have few around the park."
,,Holday,5.0,,Brilliant place to visit some beautiful birds there. Lovely waterfall. Good for children. Trains go round every 10 minutes.
,,Worth Visit,5.0,,"Book tickets Online Combo for Bird Park , Zoo, Night Safari, River Safari with Tram Rides is value for money.
U can use it within 7 days of 1st date of visit to anyone.
Nice beautiful birds and Bird Shows.
Get down at Boon Lay MRT and take bus to Bird Park.
Confirm with MRT officials in uniform for which exit to go out and they are quite helpful."
,,Interesting,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is just beautiful, the bird show was nice, the whole set up inside the park is excellent. It is really wonderful for children."
,,Wonderful Birds!,5.0,,"I have been to Singapore several times recently and still hadn't visited the famous Jurong Bird Park but I made up for that omission recently. The park is a wonderful attraction with its lovely grounds, tropical vegetation, huge walk-in aviaries and more than 400 different bird species. It is possible to take a ""train"" around the park with a couple of stops where you can get off to look at birds more closely. I chose to walk despite the heat and humidity and it was well worth the effort as I saw all the aviaries and could spend lots of time in those of the most interest. I particularly enjoyed the penguin and owl displays and the flocks of scarlet ibis and roseate spoonbills in the wetlands were breathtaking. There were plaques with plenty of information (some in Braille for blind visitors) about the various species in each aviary, in many cases with details about the conservation status of each bird.
The adult entrance price is $29 but I decided to buy a year's pass for a mere $39 and have already visited twice. On the second visit I went to the bird feeding in the Waterfall Aviary. It was a little disappointing as the keeper didn't show a lot of interest and seemed reluctant to go into details about some of the birds when asked. I also went to the High Flyers Show in the Pools Amphitheatre. It was interesting, with the birds appearing at ease with their activities, and the commentary was informative although I would have liked more of a conservation message to be pushed instead of one single reference to buying recycled timber. I felt a little uncomfortable when a large group of
flamingoes were herded on to the stage at the end of the show as they looked stressed but otherwise the visit was a wonderful one and I look forward to going again in the future."
,,Joy,5.0,,"Singapore is well planned and very organised that goes for everything. This attraction was really lovely, get to see so many beautiful birds etc some which we had only seen in books or documentaries the park is well spread out and the cages etc are made as natural as possible . The shows are really good too. Very good staff and knowledgeable."
,,My favorite place in Singapore,4.0,,"I visited Jurong Bird Park with my family 25 years after my first visit. A lot has changed in Singapore but Jurong Bird Park is still my favorite spot. Expect to spend half a day there. The park is not that big and you do not need a tram ticket. There are many rest stations with ice cream stalls and restrooms to relax. Do not miss the shows. We went to the 11AM show and there is one around 2 as well. Confirm the timings on the day of your visit. The birds are well cared for and you can get really close to some of them. One disappointment was the parrots of paradise. Unlike my last visit when I could take pics with the birds on my shoulder, they are locked away now. There is talk of moving it to Singapore zoo but I love the current location though it is far from city center. Taxi line is long after the visit and this is something the authorities need to work on. We waited for 45 min and taxis came by infrequently. I am taking away a star for this reason and the fact I could not get close to the parrots like before. Definitely a must see in Singapore regardless"
,,Spectacular Showcase of Birds,5.0,,"What a delightful park to visit – an educational experience for the whole family! To get the lay of the land, we began our visit by taking the tram tour first and then decided which areas were of greatest interest. We were amazed and delighted not only by the array of birds we found in the park – everything from owls and parakeets to pelicans and flamingos – but by the cleanliness of the grounds and cages as well. Visit the Breeding and Research Center to learn about egg size, number of eggs each bird lays per year, how newborns are cared for by the park, and how aquatic birds are prepared for release into various exhibits! The bird shows are great fun for children and adults alike. Absolutely amazing! Visiting this park does involve a lot of walking, which can be tiring in humid tropical weather. Wear good walking shoes, and take along bottled water!"
,,Best Attraction in Singapore!,5.0,,Over 1000 different species of birds. Amazing colors! Well worth price of admission. Great photo op.
,,Good experience,5.0,,"We went early morning to the park, it was a little far away from the place we were staying ... bought the pass online....didn't miss any of the shows and feeding sessions ... explored the park and was free by 12:30ish... the park has all sorts of birds and has a man made waterfall as :) good for families"
,,Good collection of birds!,4.0,,"We've visited this place multiple times in the past, and have always loved the good collection of all kinds of birds here.

There are basically two main types of bird displays; technically, there's now a third type. The first features birds in enclosed cages. The second are huge aviaries. The third is a bird museum with dead birds on display.

The cages are big enough to allow the birds to move about, though not nearly as big as they need. The problem with these cages are that the fences are dense, so dense that it's difficult to take pictures of the birds in the cages. You can see them, but when you try to take pictures, the fences become an interference.

The aviaries are a great place to get up-close-and-personal with birds. These are also good places to take pictures, if you are patient enough.

The museum displays are kind of boring, we felt.

We came here in the morning, soon after the park opened (at 8:30am, which is surprisingly early!) During the initial hours, the park is much less crowded, and we enjoyed being able to walk around unhurried, without noise from other visitors, and taking pictures without interference from other visitors. As more visitors showed up, the noise level went up (there were groups that were making so much noise that the birds were scared off), and taking pictures became harder.

Overall this is a park to visit once every few years. But do visit in the morning and on a weekday if you want less crowd."
,,Nice nice nice,4.0,,Cool place- seems we have come to a different world altogether--such serenity in the air and calmness in the surroundings--no pollution at all :) :) . very nice indeed...need 2 walk a bit from the tram stations ...a bit difficult may be for senior citizens
,,Good Park,4.0,,"Jurong is easily one of the best bird parks in the world with a lot of aerial creatures of different sizes and shapes. From colourful parrots to snowy owls to hunting vultures, you get to see lots of different bird species here and a fun outing for both kids as well as elders.

Do check out the different bird shows at their amphitheatres. As it requires a lot of walking, would recommend 2 -3 hours to leisurely cover the entire park."
,,What an interesting place to watch bird s,5.0,,"There are two bird shows that you can't miss. The show with Falcons and raptors and the show with talking, singing birds. The rest of the park is fascinating and well laid out. During non peak hours the taxi is about S$20 each way so with a group of four it is not a reason not to go. Just get there early enough to se the shows mentioned. A special shout out to Elyn at the ticket counter. She spent extra effort to make our visit to Singapore special."
,,Nice outing with toddler daughter,4.0,,"I had gone here with my parents (senior citizens) and toddler daughter. Since it was a weekday, there was much less crowd.
We bought the tram tickets near the entrance. The tram turned out to be useful as it is a bit of work to walk the entire park, especially for senior citizens. The tram has convenient stops and makes the whole day more bearable.
We had decided to watch all the bird shows so our schedule was - penguin feeding, high flyers show, chat with hornbill, lorrie loft, aviary feeding, birds of prey. With this itinerary you need to go around the entire park only once. Lunch can be had at lorrie loft or there are numerous eateries throughout the park.
The park had an offer going on that day, wherein for S$50, you could take pictures at any location in the park and you'd be given all the soft copies. Turned out to be a good deal."
,,Lots to see,4.0,,"Good selection of birds and a very good bird show. Well worth a visit. It has a walk through aviary where you can feed birds by hand, plus an indoor night zone with. Owls etc. Allow 3 or 4 hours.s"
,,Parrot park or so I renamed it,5.0,,"Beautiful parrots ,of all colours, perched on a branch,has a beautiful butterfly park inside and birds of all kinds"
,,"If you love birds, you will love this place.",3.0,,"Just like the name, they really have a wide range of birds from flamingos to parrots to idk what else. They have a section within the park where you can buy their food for around $2 (per cup) so you can attract the birds to eat it from your cup. They have few shows as well, so come like 10-15mins before to secure your seats."
,,amazing place,5.0,,we spent an entire day here and had a blast. lot of birds that we saw for the first time. also lots of great shows.
,,Birds are great,5.0,,my family had a great time at the Bird Park. The childrens water playground was amazing and my 2 year old daughter loved it. Lots of species to look at.
,,Wide variety of birds,5.0,,"Feed the parakeet, or gaze at the rich red colour of Scarlet Ibis. Jurong Bird Park is sure to not disappoint its visitors with a wide variety of birds found there. I was on a business trip and had a day off to myself. So i decided to saunter alone to this lovely park. I had heard many positive things about it and each of them turned out to be true. Birds crossed pathways freely and you could feed them. I saw Toucans with their famous prominent beak. This is a must visit for every nature lover. A good place for children to get closer to nature."
,,Large variety of colourful birds in beautiful surrounding,5.0,,"Was keen to see ostriches, got more with cassowary, flamingos, pelicans, colourful parakeets, swan, ducks and so many more!
The birds look healthy, cages were clean, especially liked walking through the huge aviary covered with net, viewing the birds quite closely.
The tram is alright to get a view of the park, only after you have seen all the birds by walking through the park, as the birds in the cages are not visible from the tram."
,,Unreal bird life,5.0,,"We got to the zoo in time for the bird show and it was amazing, the pink flamingoes were exquisite. We saw colourful toucans, and different types of birds that we don't have at home"
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,"Very nice bird park, children will definitely enjoy. there are some shows which are fantastic. specially parrot show..."
,,Lots of Hills!,4.0,,Great variety of birds but the hills were challenging with the heat and 2 knee replacements. Thankful for the trolly that went round and round!
,,Lots of different birds,4.0,,A great park showcasing many species of birds. Quite a number of stairs and a fair ammount of walking involved
,,Spectacular!!!!,5.0,,One word say it all spectacular. Very very beautiful birds all around you feed them n click pictures just beautiful. The best part is the bird show at 11 am if you don't see it ur trip is waste have never seen birds so well trained and cared must go over all other attractions. It also has worlds tallest manmade waterfall...
,,Get here on openng,5.0,,"We loved the bird park. Get here on opening as it gets HOT. Bring hats, wear long sleeves and sunscreen.

Kids should bring their swimmers as there is a big water park. Buy the tickets on the Klook app. Don't miss the shows especially the singing bird in the main arena! It was a little time consuming to find a cab to get back. We left about 12pm.

Food and drinks were way overpriced. $AUD14 for a frappucino Ice cream drink near the kids water park."
,,Excellent park with excellent customer swrvice,5.0,,"I visited the Jurong bird park today with my 1yo. I had pre-purchased a Lunch with Parrots deal from on online supplier Klook. Unfortunately due to a mistake, I booked for tomorrow's date instead of today's. As I was leaving, Jurong bird park was gracious enough to allow me to use the voucher today, despite the online supplier, Klook, refusing to do so. A big shout out to Vara in the customer service centre (he was so patient & very supportive) & Alison too for their amazing service & spending time & effort with the online supplier persuading them to amend the date. I loved that the park is amazing but that also the people working in the park were too. Nothing short of great customer service & actually caring about your customers.
PS/do not purchase tickets online from Klook, a HK based company with no customer service. I will review them separately. They should change their name to KRooks."
,,Among the best in the world,5.0,,"I was there to see the birds and I took photos of about 200 species. I gather that the place is on the improve again having been allowed to decline somewhat between my visits.
There can be few places in the world where one can see so many species of birds, largely quite well kept, in just a few hours."
,,Absolutely amazing,5.0,,"The park is huge and well-manicured, while giving you a feeling that you are surrounded by the jungle. There are several species of penguins, large pelicans, lots of flamingoes, birds of prey, hornbills, owls, ostriches, emus, as well as smaller birds. Even an extremely tall man-made waterfall. The children can play with water slides and other games. The high entrance fee ($29 for adults and $19 for children older than 3) is justified by the high standards of maintenance. You can rent a small cart to pull two young children at a time and/or take a train. The only annoying thing on the train is the recording of a highly-pitched woman's voice that you are forced to listen to and that is pitching the restaurants and other paying places."
,,Enjoyable visit,5.0,,This bird park is very well designed. You can ride a tram around the entire park and it has 2 stop off points. We chose to ride the tram around the. Walk the park as you see much more that way. Make sure to visit the waterfall area as it is very pretty!
,,Beautiful birds,4.0,,This is a delightful place to visit with birds from around the world in all their splendour. I will say though that I feeel their enclosures are too small and the park could do with a face lift. Even though well worth a visit
,,It was a good visit,4.0,,"The Bird park was very good, it was nice seeing all the different bird species they had. The reason why I gave it a four is because we had a bit of trouble getting into the park because they couldn't locate our tickets, so we had to wait with our tour guide, other than that it was amazing."
,,Love with nature n birds,5.0,,"Jurong bird park , located a little far off from the main city but is definitely worth a visit if u are visiting Singapore. You can see a wide range of birds in the sanctuary n even feed them with your own hands. The show stopper of this park is definitely the bird show which should not be missed at any cost. Tip: keep a 5 or 10$ bill ready in your pocket for some additional fun n adulation! See the mackaw singing n other birds showing other antics during the show! Definitely recommended for all n not just kids"
,,Bird Lover's Delight,5.0,,"I was gifted a surprise trip to this place, which I wasn't able to visit when I was a kid.
It was as amazing as I had hoped. The shows were educational as well as entertaining and the animals are simply beautiful. It's excellent to see these institutions breeding and helping improve wild populations of native endangered species.
I loved this place and would happily go back again."
,,Birds Galore,4.0,,A great place to take children. Well laid out out and sign posted. Food options very disappointing. However the staff were very helpful on any request.
,,our holiday,5.0,,This was our first visit to the Jurong Bird Park. It is everything that we expected. It is easy to get to by taxi. So much fun for the kids and so much information for everyone.
,,"Great Experience, too bad they're leaving Jurong",4.0,,"This bird park is great--I wish the 'asia' section was larger to focus on birds from this region--but it's also interesting to see birds from all over the world. The bird shows are fun if you're into that kind of thing, and the bird park has done a pretty good job of straddling conservation efforts with entertainment. However, they're moving the location to near the zoo and that's a huge shame. Developing more land and taking away such a secluded spot in busy, industrial Jurong is a huge shame."
,,The highlight of my trip,5.0,,"We got a deal for 4 attractions, the Zoo, the bird park, night safari and river cruise. We skipped the river cruise because we got pretty exhausted but let me tell you, I would have paid that price just for Jurong bird park because this is a really great place to spend your entire day looking at birds, learning about them and feeding them. I have gone there earlier and I was blown away by how awesomely it has expanded. They are located away from the center of the city and you pass by some industrial parks. I think this is deliberate because there are fewer things to agitate the birds. there were several enclosures where they are let free and although it sounds risky but it isnt. I will definitely go back here when I visit Singapore again. This is simply an attraction for everyone. Just be mindful and not make this a picnic area."
,,Great show and attractions,5.0,,"This was our second visit to the bird park. The bird show is wonderful, and the variety of birds is excellent. Unfortunately, we didn't have nearly enough time on our tour to view everything and take the pictures we wanted. Next time I will try to make our own way out there so we can take our time and see everything."
,,A little disappointed,3.0,,"As I love birds, this is the third time we've been here and I confess I was a little disappointed this time. I find it particularly annoying that although the enclosures are labelled with the name of the bird(s) species, there is no map or in most cases any indication of where they come from. This seems like a fairly fundamental thing that should be there. As Singapore does most things so well, this is disappointing."
,,Feed the lorikeets in Lory Loft,5.0,,"So much fun to feed the birds in the Lory Loft, they drink the nectar out of a cup you hold for them (for $3 SD charge). Beautiful bird park that is on the West side of town, but has MRT station. We didn't realize it was so far from the zoo, but had a great visit."
,,This is must,5.0,,Perfect treating bird. Make fresh there flying. Very nice place with a lot of kind of birds. If you are couple or with baby there is the place you must visit.
,,A must visit,5.0,,A must visit place for the family. You can spend the whole day there. Plan your visit to enjoy the shows and bird feeding.
,,good display. worth the trip,5.0,,Really enjoyed the display of birds. Try and plan your time there around the show times. Either 10 am & 11am or 3pm & 4pm. Really worth a look. We got this as part of the 4 park pass.
,,"For birds lovers, photographers, family with young children, and a breath of fresh air",4.0,,"Family with young children, join member for Singapore Zoo, River Safari & Jurong Bird Park regular / annually visitation"
,,Beautiful park with amazing shows,5.0,,As with all Singapore's parks the Jurong Bird Park is beautifully maintained. The easiest way to get there is by MRT to Boon Lay on the green line. Follow the signs to the bus interchange on exiting the station and catch the 194 bus which drops you off outside the Bird Park. Not to be missed is the High Flyers Show in the Amphitheatre. also don't miss the opportunity to feed the birds at the Lory Loft which you access through the cafe. A wonderful day out!
,,Birds & Botanicals,4.0,,"Although eventually rained out, this was a great place to visit. From kids to seniors there was something to see. We especially enjoyed the high flying birds show. Ticket prices are somewhat pricey and there can be more walking than some would prefer."
,,Singapore's Bird Park,4.0,,"The Bird Park is situated about half an hour out of the city but is worth the trip. We travelled by taxi which only cost about fourteen Singapore dollars there and back.
The Bird Park promised much and for the most part delivered on that promise. It is spread out over quite an area but you can avail yourself of the little tram which visits most sites and from which you can easily walk to see the exhibits if walking up the little hills in the heat is a problem..
The show in the amphitheatre is exciting and well worth seeing. The large macaws were magnificent and the level of training demonstrated by staff was fantastic. Some of the most awesome birds from around the world that you may have heard of are here and the variety of parrots here is inspiring.
My only downside from the visit was to see the large birds of prey located in relatively small aviaries disallowing free flight which they so love to do. Good experience."
,,Wonderful Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,This is our first family outing to the Jurong Bird Park. We all find the bird park is very interesting. There are good varieties of birds. Good for half a day.
,,Heaven on Earth for Birds (Must see photos with this review),5.0,,I have never been such place for birds ever before as this is heaven for birds around the world. Properly kept by the authorities & taken care. Please do see pictures i have posted to see types of birds.
,,Great for Bird Lovers,4.0,,"We took the train to Boon Lay MRT then the local bus (#194) to the Bird Park. The Bird Park pass was included in the 4 Park Pass (Singapore Zoo, Night Safari, River Safari and Bird Park). However, while the other 3 parks are all next to each other the Bird Park is quite some distance away. As we had a spare morning we decided we may as well use the pass. I am not a bird lover but still enjoyed walking around the garden and looking at all the varieties and colours of birds in the park."
,,Great experience,4.0,,"Really enjoyed the Bird Park, it was bigger than I expected and very well set out. Really enjoyed feeding the parakeets, but watch out for the Phillipines Cockatoo, he's a serial biter!"
,,Amazing! Do not miss!,5.0,,"Just like the Zoo this is a place you can't afford to miss. You'll need about 4-5 hours to cover the whole area. It's well maintained.

You'll have to understand that you have to walk a lot! That's the best way to cover. Don't miss the bird shows. Check the site for timings and other details.

Note: if you are traveling by Singapore airlines you get a 10℅ discount on tickets at most places. You'll need to ask them if they have a discount and show them your boarding pass."
,,A paradise for bird lovers,5.0,,"After a Metro trip for about 45 minutes followed by a 5-minute bus ride we reached Jurong Bird Park from the Somerset Metro station. Such a peaceful place compared to the sounds of the city, and there were an amazing number of various birds to watch in the well-organised park. Well worth the entrance fee and the travelling time! Recommended!"
,,must see,5.0,,Went along with my family. enjoyed a lot. Possibly every type of birds were there. will advice to go early. Secondly keep looking for park people who feed the birds. Seeing feeding is worth seeing. There is food counter inside.enjoy
,,Nice Bird Place,4.0,,We stayed one week in Singapore and visited the place on a morning. They have wunderful birds from all over the world. We liked the Pelicans. The park is well maintained by a lof of friendly Gardeners. All in all a nice morning.
,,A good day out,3.0,,"This place has a variety of birds to look at and one can spend around 3-4 hrs going through the place.There are food stops inside as well in case you get tired.
But we felt that the Singapore zoo had much more to see than the Jurong bird park..And some parts were not maintained that well.Like the water was smelling as it had not been changed.They have some bird shows which were nice."
,,One of the highlights of our Singapore trip,5.0,,"If you have any interest whatsoever in exotic wildlife, then I recommend you give this place a visit.
My wife and I spend several hours walking around here, but the highlight of the visit was the Lory Loft, which is a huge enclosed aviary that you can walk around in, feed and interact with the birds.
Most highly recommended.
A tip, there are websites where you can pre purchase your tickets at reduced rates"
,,"Birds, Birds and more Birds",4.0,,"This park was full of every type of bird from Penguins to Ostriches. The park is set amongst beautiful greenery, a long walk and at times quite hilly, so not for the faint hearted in the warm Singapore climate. I was disappointed that the Hawks are not on show unless you see the show - so this was something we had missed when we arrived and did not get to see them at all. The park is very much geared towards education of children and school groups were in abundance on our visit. All in all a nice place to visit to see birds of all types - although I think that the SIngapore Zoo was better value and had birds as well. To get to the park is fairly easy with the MRT system getting a train to Jurong and then a bus #194 that drops you right outside the park."
,,Birds park at it's best,5.0,,Not a bird watcher or anything like that. However Jurong's Bird park was quite something else! It is so well kept and well organised. It did open my eyes a bit! Rellay enjoyed the visit.
,,"Overall, a good day out",4.0,,"The bird park is very easy to get to following the instructions on the website. I got a cheaper ticket from Klook website. I spent the whole day here from 12 to 5. Definite hi-lights were the Loris as they are free flying in a large netted area. Here u can feed them using special food u can buy. Please don't feed them your sandwiches/bread/snacks! The pelicans are amazing and the feeding time pretty unique. However, some pens are quite small for the size of the birds here, especially for larger birds like ostrich, emu that did not seem to have enough room to run properly and the owls did not have much room and penguins also. If you do not like zoos with areas like this, do not go. On balance I saw enough that I liked to recommend this place. The park is informative about endangered species. the park does seem to be doing of conservation projects and the breeding programme was really good to see. It would be nice if the shops sold a wider ranges of more eco-friendly/educational items. I've read on wiki that the bird park will move location in 2020 so it is unlikely that there will be much investment in the current park until then. Food/ drinks seemed expensive and were mainly junk foods with a lack of healthy/organic products that could be sold at a place like this to match the 'ethos' . Toilets v clean. Nice to stroll around but you may want some mosquito repellent (sold at the shops too). Definitely go."
,,Interesting attraction.,4.0,,"A really interesting attraction, considering you may actually get to meet and feed birds which is usually not possible in a day to day life.
Tip 1: Try to go as early as possible (maybe by 9AM) so that maximum number of hungry birds come to you (in Lory Loft).
Tip 2: Wear colorful clothes.
Tip 3: Do not miss the shows."
,,A Singapore Treasure,5.0,,"I love birds! Today, I had the opportunity to visit a fantastic bird park! It was very easy to get to the Jurong Bird Park via the MRT and bus. I would recommend getting the tram ticket as well as the tram gives you a wonderful overview of the park. Later you can take the tram to two of the highlights of the park as well. We saw both shows, the High Flyers and the Eagle show and both were very well done and enjoyable. However, my favorite was feeding the Lorikeets in the Lory Enclosure. They had to check out my hair as well as getting some food. My husband got some great pictures and a fun video to share!"
,,family day,4.0,,"was a great place to bring over family and young kids let them be far away from ipad iphone, near to nature and green view. i bring my mum and dad along the trip and the love it."
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,My wife and I spent over 3hrs walking and admiring the variety of birds that are held in spacious enclosures in natural habitats. The plumage of some birds is incredible and photos do not give them justice. The chance to feed the Lorikeets in the Lory Enclosure is a delight with several birds sitting on you waiting to be fed.
,,Jurong bird park,5.0,,"It is one of the best places in Singapore to visit. Once bought a ticket, all shows are included. Live shows timings are written on display boards. Take a tram ride first to go around the park to have broad view. Then attend some live shows like High flyers, Eagle show etc. Keep your camera ready for wonderful photography. Beautiful flower decorations at many places in the park are there for memorable pics. Don't miss Bird feeding shows like Penguin show, Eagle show, Vultures show etc. The best is High flyers show at 11 am & 3 pm."
,,Worth IT,5.0,,perhaps a very good example of how a Bird Park ought to be. Various varieties all to fascinate and make one understand the world beyond human nature. Needs atleast 3 hours for it and if you cannot walk use the tram
,,Awesome for family with kids,5.0,,Worth to be visited for and kids would enjoy. Bird shows is a must to be watched for! Kids can play on their small water park for a swim and play.
,,Very Interesting,5.0,,It's an excellent little park. It's best if one walks around it instead of taking the little tram. It's best for families with children to visit. The staff were all very nice.
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"Every time we visit, this place gets better and better. We love to see all the different birds, a great experience."
,,I was disappointed.,2.0,,I was expecting more local birds. I have see a lot of these birds and it was a long way to go. If you have never been to a bird park then by all means make the trip. But if you have seen flamingos and ducks and eagles then I don't see a lot of other varieties to make the cost and travel worth it.
,,Amazing and expansive Bird Park - great for families or couples,5.0,,"We were pleasantly surprised by how large the park was and how many different bird species they had. A nice atmosphere to casually walk through the park, opportunities to relax, feed the birds or watch a show. Even when there are many visitors the park is large enough that you never feel your in the middle of too many people. Something for everyone."
,,Amazing Experience!!,5.0,,"Although it is situated cose to the industrial area, this Jurong Bird park is really an amazing place, only to be seen to be believed.. Infinite varities of birds.... great ambience .... extremley clean Entry price is 29 SGD .... a little costly I thought."
,,Birds' paradise in Singapore,4.0,,Enjoy a stroll in Singaporean hill top while encountering various birds that you can't even imagine exist! The kids will surely love it.
,,great park,4.0,,this bird park is a must see and is well thought out for the birds. A large variety of birds that are uncaged which is nice to visit
,,Excellent entertainment!,4.0,,"We caught a train as far as Boon Lay and then caught bus 194 from the interchange. All worked very smoothly. We did not purchase our tickets in advance, but no long queues. On presenting SIA Boarding Pass we received a 10% discount. It pays to arrive early as many of the events begin as early as 9-30am.. The Bird show begins at 11am and then repeated again at 3pm. That was most enjoyable and the birds are very well trained. Lovely surroundings and though walking is not too much of a problem a train ticket can be an optional extra, of $5, but well worth it!"
,,BIRDS ANYWHERE!,4.0,,"You will appreciate the park if you are a bird lover. Notes below:

- Ticket is around S$25.00 per person (Tram not included)
- Tram will cost you about S$4.00
- You can bring your food and drinks inside the park.
- Shows are also available."
,,Huge variety of birds,5.0,,The parrots were amazing. Huge variety of birds to see. Very well maintained. Highly recommended for tourists.
,,Great Visit,5.0,,Best bird park I have ever been to and was easy to get to using MRT and Bus connection was easy to find. This is a must see attraction for all the family. Take an umbrella to keep sun 0ff!!
,,Best bird park,5.0,,"I've been lucky enough to see a lot off zoos around the world this is the best bird park
That I've seen. The birds look healthy and happy the large tropical aviary with a 100ft water fall is stunning. It was great to see African grays in free flight in a family group this
Was the next best thing to the wild. Large lakes with Waterfowl and lot of other birds to
see. They put on a show with macaws,toucans,cranes and flamingos.
Well worth the visit"
,,Fun for all ages,5.0,,"From penguins to lorikeets, this park has a wide variety of birds from all over the world. Some of the displays allowed photography without an intervening cage or glass. The shows are interactive and lively. Restrooms were abundant, and as is typical in Singapore, clean."
,,Absolutely fantastic,5.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is a solid favorite on my list of attractions in Singapore. A dazzling array of colorful birds, great displays, and a crowd-pleasing show. Getting around is easy either on foot or with the tram that runs a circuit through the park. We took a taxi to the park on this occasion but I have previously used a combination of MRT and bus which was pretty convenient too."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"This was one of the highlights of Singapore. We got to experience toucans landing on us, as well as macaws - as volunteers."
,,Awesome Family Time,4.0,,"We visited Jurong Bird Park during peak season in December. Expecting a crowded park with limited space to move around, we found it otherwise.. The park was cleverly zoned so that visitors could walk comfortably from one zone to the next. In the morning the air was so fresh.. we loved walking slowly and enjoyed our time together. The bird collection was amazing.. Our family loved the bird show at the amphiteatre... and after we also enjoyed our time at the waterfall. The flamingos... oooowww... very nice to see many of those beautiful birds... Awasome family time, absoultely..."
,,Best of the four parks,5.0,,"We really enjoyed our visit to Jurong Bird Park. I honestly have low expectations because it's only birds, but the variety of bird species in the park is astounding. We found ourselves exploring the entire park and reading on about the different birds for more info.

Don't miss the shows. Plan your day around them because they're really nice. I would also recommend getting the unlimited tram rides, so you can go around the park faster and less tiring."
,,Fabulous day out at Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"My husband and I travelled by train and then took a connecting bus to Jurong Bird Park. It was very easy to do so and gave us a great look at the south western part of Singapore. It took us approximately 40 mins to travel to Jurong after leaving the City Hall train station. Upon arrival the main show was beginning (11 am) and it was a must to see. The show went for about 30 mins and was very professionally run and an absolute delight to watch. As we both love birds we wanted to interact as much as possible with the birds. Every area in the park was clean and well deigned. Some of the birds were able to fly freely and others caged in large enclosures. We also used the motorised train to get about the park. We even fed the many parrots in their enclosure. When we decided to leave and return we simply walked back to the bus stop and caught the bus back to the train station and then back to City Hall. I must admit we had a relaxing few hours here and would highly recommend this attraction to everyone. Before you go, buy a tourist pass ( we had a 2 day one which we purchased from the ticketing counter at the train station for $26. After 2 days of travel we returned to the station to collect the $10 refundable deposit back."
,,Lots of Birds,4.0,,This place is a clear winner among kids. There are so many species of birds and kids love it. Place is very nice and clean and you can even feed the birds which was cool. There is a tram that you can take (separate ticket to buy) and roam inside. Nice place. Can finish in 2-4 hours depending on how serious bird love you are.
,,must visit place in singapore,5.0,,"This is one of the best bird park i have visited. Dont think of it as a normal bird park and skip this place when you r in singapore. one can easily spend half day here (4 hrs approx).
entry fee SGD 29 , (but other combo offers also available).
nearest mrt (metro) is Boon lay (i was travelling from eastern part of singapore) take BUS NO 194 from Boon lay it will drop u near the park. For vegetarians only pizza hut option is available inside park. U may also get some sandwiches."
,,Expansive with great variety,4.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park was a real surprise, as it had an incredible range of animals (mostly birds of course) and was enormous. The facilities were excellent, and the variety was incredible. I highly recommend the waterfall area at the back of the park. The clear negative though is the number of old and dated enclosures that many of the birds are in. I recommend purchasing a ticket on the tram if you are travelling with children, and taking a full lap of the park before you start to plan your day."
,,Feed the Parrots when you visit!!!,5.0,,"If you have children this place is a must. There is a point where you can buy coconut water to feed the parrots with and your children will love it (so will you). Again, have a good camera with you to make the most of the opportunities that the place gives you.

Easy to get to in a taxi and not expensive in comparison to the other attractions in Singapore"
,,Amazing array of beautiful birds,5.0,,I highly recommend visiting if you are in the area. Beautiful birds in a natural environment. They work hard to present the birds in an educational manner - teaching visitors about human encroachment on the environment. Excellent displays and incredible assortment of birds.
,,Love visiting the Bird Park,5.0,,"Lory Loft, Owls and shows are a must! You will need at least 3/4 of a day to cover the park. Be prepared for plenty of walking and bring a long a water bottle at least."
,,visit ruined by rain,1.0,,yes rain and thunder is an act of god. But poor staff handling isn't. no real explanations given. luckily we demanded refund bcos it wasn't offered freely. park is a fantastic attraction when weather permits but don't bother if weather is no good as a lot of walking involved and uncovered attractions
,,Amazing birds in the natural environment,5.0,,The Jurong Bird Park is a must if you like to see birds in their natural environment. Lovely settings.
,,Avian Heaven!,5.0,,"Jurong Birds Park is a must-visit, along with the Zoo. It has hundreds of bird species from all over the world, from the Arctics to the tropics. Don't miss the penguin and flamingo displays. There are also live bird shows, with macaws performing tricks."
,,#Overall Jurong Experience#,3.0,,"Me and my family visited Jurong Bird Park on 24th Dec 2016. Transportation to Jurong is very easy via MRT or Bus. It is highly connected to both. Overall park experience and the bird species are good and one time must go kind of. But the only must watch show is High Flyer Show. Pelican chit Chat and kings of the Sky shows are really boring and not that interactive. As we visited Singapore in rainy season so it is highly recommended to carry umbrella. A small water play area called Birdz of play was the most enjoyable place for my kids, so carry ur swim wears along. I am vegetarian and the food options for me everywhere were ice cream, potato fries and chips so better to carry your own home-made sandwiches, as there are many places for sitting n resting over there to enjoy ur food and the food joints are little bit over priced. Do not buy souvenirs from this place, for that the best place is China town. On public holidays and weekends Jurong provide a free shuttle service to the nearest MRT station and that is a real relief."
,,A great day out,5.0,,"I went on my own whilst my husband was working. It's easy to get to via the MRT to Boon Lay and then the 194 bus from the bus interchange to the Bird Park. There are so many attractions at the park. A highlight was the high flyers show which is both entertaining and informative, but there is so much to see at every turn. Great for children and adults, but a great family day out whether you live in Singapore or are just visiting."
,,Largest variety of birds ever seen,5.0,,"Despite being a long drive from Singapore CBD, Jurong Bird Park is an attraction to wander all day. There is a massive variety of bird life as well as some wild animals - we were lucky enough to see many lizards as we walked through the grounds. The research and discovery centres are also worth a look to learn more about the park's breeding programs. The 'Lory Loft' was a highlight for us, and the best aviary on site by far."
,,Good bird park!,4.0,,"This is a good sight seeing for all ages.. at the entrance you can experience having pictures with the parrots. Inside there are shows throughout the day for you to choose from, we only went to the bird feeding. We fed some birds with worms."
,,Good,4.0,,"I'm not a nature enthusiastic, but I did not feel bored while I was in this park. There are a lot of birds and beautiful views. I recommend it for a walk in family."
,,One Best Experience. A must visit attraction,5.0,,This is my first time to any bird park. I was one of a kind experience for me. There are so many birds species which I have not see. Dont miss the shows there.
,,Exceptional - Bring your kids here,5.0,,"It will be an exceptional learning experience if Kids can come and experience in seeing the birds in the Jurong Bird Park. The vast variety as well as the near perfect habitats are an exceptional experience and will surely bring out the child in you. Be it watching the owls in a dark room or the parakeets or the brahminy kites swoop down to show their tricks... it one helluva experience. You can have a short cut by taking a tram but I would suggest a walk around - easily adds up to many steps on your wearables - else you will miss a lot. Try booking all the parks - zoo, bird and night safari online and get good discounts."
,,A great family day out,4.0,,"Wasn't quite sure what to expect (there have been some poor reviews) but walked in through delightful gardens to an experience ranging from penguin-feeding, flight skills in an open arena, and a wide variety of unusual birds. I would happily go back again, before it is relocated (to a smaller site) in about 2020."
,,Nothing is as good as this place in singapore,5.0,,"I love bird park. I have been there 5 times and I love it every other tine. The bird show is a must watch and if you are lucky(sitting in the middle seat), you can be chosen as a volunteer."
,,amazing breadth of species -Give certain birds more space to fly and go from 4 to 5 stars,4.0,,"We visited because we love animals and heard it was of a high quality in terms of animal care standards. The day we visited was not was humid or hot as some in Singapore so we were lucky in that regard. It was only 27 minutes in a taxi from Cruise Port (S$21 in metered taxi). It is not cheap to visit (check their website) yet worth the cost. The layout is easy to navigate, being one long loop. The bird species in the park included some total favourites, many flamingoes, pelicans, parrots and even a wonderful Toucan!! The best area for the birds was a wonderful walk in massive aviary. Sure the birds were happy there. The entire parrot area did not offer the birds enough area to fly and therefore be happy. The park, in terms of signage, amenities, cleanliness etc were all up to Singapore's very high standards. Food outlets only scored a 2 star in my view, although there was free wi-fi in some areas for the teens. A great day out for bird lovers and families. We spent approx 2.5 hours there inc a couple of stops."
,,Fun and well-designed especially the waterfall area,5.0,,"My second time visiting and it was even better....Yes it is moving later this year, but there is no sign of any diminished services or amenities. Can't imagine how it will be improved."
,,Family bonding,5.0,,Still an awesome experience even though we've been there few times. Special thanks to Staff name Ernie for helping me and family..
,,A great bird park for bird lovers...,5.0,,"Visited the bird park with family. The park has a great collection of birds. My kid was very excited by seeing all these beautiful birds from so close. One can take a tram ride but for enjoying the park to the fullest, a walking tour is recommended. The parrot pavilion is great. Main attractions were flamingoes, snow owl, ostrich, penguins. Do not forget to watch the different bird shows at display."
,,Superb Morning out,5.0,,"We brought my 5 and 3 year old children plus my mother in law for a morning to Jurong Bird Park. We seemed to have timed it well. We arrived at 10am and saw the park wardens feeding the Penguins. Then we went to sit in the outdoor arena and waited for the bird show to start at 11am. We had a good half hour wait and it was getting hot but thankfully the show arena was well shaded. The bird show was excellent. It kept the children and the adults engaged and was very educational as well as being fun. The children waited in a line at the end of the show to get a photograph with some Flamingos but this wasn't so great.
There rest of the park was lovely. We only spent 3 hours there in total so we chose to visit the Waterfall area and it was spectacular.

Unfortunately, the children's' water splash play area was closed the weekend we visited.
The main criticism I can think of is that it wouldn't be suitable for children younger than 3 as there seemed to be a lot of steps in some areas and not a lot of shade in many other areas either.

Overall though, an excellent visit and we look forward to returning soon."
,,Great place!,4.0,,"It was our first time to this park.

It is very huge, clean and entertaining!

The shows were great. Feeding the birds is one of the activities that you must do - it's very fun, my kid loves it!

It takes around 30 minutes by taxi from city center, or 1 hour by MRT and bus."
,,Don't Miss This Park,5.0,,"Park has a display, of well cared for birds from all over the world Bird shows are well worth attending."
,,Great outing for family,4.0,,"One of the few bird parks in the world. A small park great for family outing. It is relatively small park and can be best explored on foot. The tram rides are really not necessary and you don't see the birds up close. However there are many incline slopes, so comfortable shoes are a must. Best to visit during the mornings. The park is easily accessible and via the MRT. Alight at Boon Lay station and take bus # 194 for less than 10 minutes."
,,For birds and nature lover,5.0,,It was lovely well kept place for birds and nature lover. I love to spend the whole day there but so many things still to do in our itinerary. Take at least even half day to explore the place if you want to relax and enjoy the nature. Everything in Singapore is very accessible by their transportation system. So clean place.
,,Still great after all these years,4.0,,"We visited Jurong Bird Park more then 20 years ago and now we came again. It's still a great park, although the aging is obvious and easily seen, but the upkeep is there and I see that the animals, mainly birds are in good shape and look healthy and taken care of. We had yet another pleasant day in Jurong Bird park and our fond memories will continue living with us."
,,Jurong bird park,4.0,,It is a must see place for kids wherein you can keep the birds on your hands there are so many colourful birds which is beyond imagination. Feeding birds in a cup of bowl is a good experience also shows shown there are really entertaining
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Had such a good day here.
Caught train then bus. Very easy can't get list. If we can do it anyone can. Cost us about$4 each way.
You can get a train that takes you around which costs $5 or just walk which is better you see so much more.
So many different birds. Even showing from incubation to young birds and then adults..
Good way to spend a day.
So much to see"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,This is a great place to visit to see a great variety of birds from around the world. The two shows are fantastic (about 25 minutes each) and the exhibits around the park really interesting - especially the waterfall aviary. Keep your eye out for iguanas.
,,Lovely Day Out,5.0,,Been here so many times and still the kids love to go out there and be in sync with nature and the birds!
,,Wonderful experience with birds,4.0,,"If you have at least half a day free - go to Jurong Bird Park Don't miss feeding time ,especially in Waterfall Aviary."
,,"Birds Birds, Don't miss the Shows",5.0,,"It is amazing to see lot of varieties of birds in one place. Well maintained and lot of information about the birds on display. Can buy tickets at the counter. You can save money when you buy all 4 parks tickets at once for Jurong Bird Park, Singapore Zoo, Night Safari & River Safari."
,,This is a must if you have kids 6 years and above!!,5.0,,"This was my second visit, but this time for the first time with my family including my 2 daughters - 6 and 14 years. For both of them, it was an experience of the beauty of nature. Its a must go for kids of this generation as we live in cities and it is impossible to be up close and personal with nature. And yes, at Jurong Bird Park you get to see Penguins!! That too in two different enclosures.

Jurong Bird Park is a little far off and is situated in Jurong Hill. So, you have to plan well to reach on time as the first bird show is at 10 am in the morning. We were staying near Dakota MRT and it took us more than an hour to reach the place. So, please plan well.

There are 3 shows in the morning back to back. The first show is at 10 am which is King of the Skies show. Well, this show is average, to be frank. So, if you want to skip any 1 show, this should be it, especially because its the first one in the morning and if you are running late, then don't fret. The 2nd activity is Penguin Feeding at the Penguin Coast. This is a must attend. First, watch the staff feeding and giving a short discourse on feeding. And then the best part is that you also get to feed the penguins by buying fish for 2 SGD and offering to the ever ready to eat Penguins. It is a lovely experience. Then comes the best show @ Jurong - High Flyers Show. HIGH FLYERS SHOW IS A MUST WATCH. In fact, you should visit Jurong only for this show. Please do see this especially if you have kids. It is really fascinating.

After the 3 back to back shows in the morning, my recommendation is to take the park tram which is not very expensive. It gives you a leisurely ride across the bird park with stops like the Lory Loft and Waterfall Aviary. Do stop over at these places and experience birds in nature. The way they have housed the birds are fascinating. You know for sure that the birds don't feel as if they are in captivity. Waterfall Aviary features the highest manmade waterfall. It is a good place to get pics clicked. So, I would recommend the tram ride. Though we didn't choose to walk around at all, the tram ride will give you the ability to get down at the designated stops and walk around at your own will to see birds of all kinds. And then whenever required you could hop on back to an upcoming tram at any of the designated stops. Kudos to the organisers for this tram arrangement.

Tips/info/things which I experienced:

- If you are using public transport. There are 2 bus stops near Jurong. One is very near (5 minutes walk), the other is little far (15 minutes walk). So, keep this in mind in case you get down on the further bus stand and you have to walk 15 minutes to walk it to reach the place. By MRT, you have to reach Boon Lay MRT on the East West Line. From Boon Lay MRT you need to go to the huge Bus terminus right next to the MRT station and take a bus. Please look up streetdirectory.com for the details.
- I did online booking from the Wildlife Reserves Singapore website. Here you get the option of booking for 4 activities - Jurong Bird Park, River Safari, Night Safari and Singapore Zoo. The more activities you book the more discount you get. I booked for only Jurong and Night Safari. For Jurong, you get the flexibility of visiting on any day for a week. For Night Safari there is a fixed date and time. Though I didn't do the River Safari and Singapore Zoo (I thought of an overdose of wildlife activities), I heard that the River Safari is a good activity. So, do check up on that and see if you want to visit that
- Well, if it rains then I don't know what happens to the shows. Both King of the Skies and High Flyers shows are in the open. So, I guess that the shows get cancelled. Do check on that. If you use the tram then you don't need umbrellas. But, if you do have umbrellas or ponchos then do carry with you to the park as it is largely an open-air activity. We were lucky as we didn't get any rain.
- The bird shows have a morning and an afternoon schedule. So, very simply Jurong Bird Park warrants either a visit from morning till afternoon or from afternoon to evening. So, in total you would roughly require minimum 3 hours here.
- There are not too many eating options here. There is a Pizza Hut and then there are few eateries like Bongo Burgers, etc. And there are no nearby places to eat as it is in a secluded forest area. So, please do not plan to eat elsewhere. If you need to eat then plan to eat at the park from the available options.

To summarise, Jurong Bird Park is a great place and is worth every buck you spend. It is situated at a secluded place which is a forest area. So, you get a nice feeling of going away from the city life and into the wild forest area and then you see the lovely birds almost as if they are in their natural surroundings. A very quiet park with lots of things to see and experience. The staff here is very efficient and courteous. All activities are very well organised and you will surely have a great experience here."
,,Fabulous time at Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park, Singapore is one of the most renowned bird sanctuaries with some of the largest free-flying aviaries in the world. Management of the Jurong Bird Park has taken all the steps to provide habitats that mirror their naturalistic environments which spreads over 20.2 hectares of exploratory landscape. Bird Park opening hours are from 8.30am to 6.00pm.

It is advisable to visit the park early in the morning as they have suggested a great itinerary to explore the park where you won’t miss any of the key events for the day. Bird shows are highlights at the park. Check out their show schedule before you start the journey. There are three of them (1) Kings of the Skies Show at Hawk Arena, (2) High Flyers Show, Pools Amphitheatre and (3) Lunch with Parrots at Songbird Terrace.

If you get tired of walking inside the park, you can explore the park at a more relaxed way on their tram rides.

If you are visiting with children, at park entrance you can rent wagons to pull your toddlers around. It would especially useful for the little ones who get tired easily. Also, available renting strollers for infants and toddlers and wheelchairs available free-of-charge for guests with special needs.

During your journey if you are with children, don't forget to visit the Birdz of Play to splash in and get wild and wonderfully wet in it’s fun wonderland. Don’t forget to take an extra set of clothes for the family. Even if you forgot do not fear, you can purchase swimwear and lovely T-shirts at the nearby gift shop.

I guarantee no matter what your age you will get an amazing time to spend at Jurong Bird Park, Singapore. Keep the full day to visit this place."
,,pathetic experience,1.0,,very less birds. Surrounds with bad smell and not maintained well. no food joints nearby. and pizza hut is there inside but its very bad.
,,awesome,4.0,,"this place is really nice for kids and adults, both. there were number of shows of birds and these were really amazing. highly recommended."
,,A good set up with some releif from the heat,4.0,,"Having been to the KL Bird Park earlier in the week, I can say that this park is far better organised and kept. KL is good, but this is better. A dedicated dark, Owl enclosure allows you to see them a bit active and it is worth looking really closely in the dark to see everything. They also have a really good collection of Hornbills which was fantastic.
Some exhibits you walk though and some you walk past. If you are a keen photographer there are areas where you can walk without screens between you and some species for better photography.
If you have long arms, pat the Emu...."
,,Birds and Flowers of Singapore,5.0,,"I've not seen a larger or more well-planned bird park in any ofmy substantial travels. Be prepared for a 3-4 hour walk around the beautiful park in order to see all the displays. Some of the most noteworthy displays were the Birds of Prey, Penguins, World of Darkness (Owls), Birds of Asia, and unexpectedly, Heliconia Walk (Many species of the beautiful Heliconia flowers). I was so mesmerized that I shot over 500 photos. After nearly three hours, we decided to forego the upper, northeastern part of the park as we had already seen most of the displays. For those who are not so ambulatory, or just want a cursory view of the park, there are frequent small trains running around the entire park which is over 2 km walking distance, not counting side trips to the displays. For anybody who likes parks, birds, and flowers, this is a must see in Singapore. One last note. You don't need to buy a half-day trip here. You can buy tickets at the gate, but it is cheaper to order them from the park online."
,,Use the hop on off service,4.0,,"Having read reviews about access, we thought we would use our last three hours of HIPPO to access the park. Made it so so easy. Only 3 services a day from Suntec, not typical on off service and got us to the door, as it were, in 45 mins. Park good, but unless you've got kids, avoid shows...just go look!!"
,,Absolute crap !,1.0,,"This must be the lone attraction/joint amongst my circa 90 reviews thus far to receive 1 star.

Several reasons contributed to this rating:

a. The place is squalid, and a lot needs to be done to 'improve' the cleanliness- not just the environs, but also the cages where the poor birds thrive

b. We purchased tickets with tram, and hopped on a tram which stopped as a result of a technical failure. This was further exacerbated by the fact that we were refused boarding to hop on another tram.

c. Most of the caged birds were truly 'distressed'- hope someone does take notice !

Overall, we were terribly disappointed and consider the Singapore Zoo a better choice !"
,,A day well-spent!,5.0,,A visit here will increase your knowledge of world geography as well as the flora & fauna around the world. The lory loft was very attractive as were most of the other enclosures. The bird show was stupendous 7 definitely NOT TO BE MISSED!!!!
,,Go for the Show,5.0,,We happened to arrive for the main bird show (11am and 3pm). I wasn't expecting much based on the animal shows we see in the US. But this was excellent! Much more activity and different birds than you normally see. My favorite part was the herding of the flamingos.
,,Must watch bird shows,5.0,,"I like the bird shows at Jurong Bird Park. There are two main shows, both are worth the time to be seated early to get the best seats. For children, bring a set of spare clothing or swim wear. There is a wet playground where children can soak in water to keep the heat away."
,,Stunning collection of birds!,5.0,,"The Jurong bird park is the best kept collection of birds I have seen anywhere in the world. It is very, very professional, clean, humane, entertaining, educational and above all highly enjoyable. The periodic flying displays are articulately engaging. Another great success story in Singapore!"
,,Birds at its Best view,5.0,,"They take care of birds really well, you will come to know that seeing the birds there. Really colorful birds. Don't miss the the shows and bird feeding there, make sure to check the show timings before going there. Also there is a nice water park and play area for kids. Make sure to take summing dress for kids. If you book through Kloovs you will get some discount."
,,Awesome experience,4.0,,"A definite must see for a young famlies.We got to see the King of the skies,Lunch with the parrots and high flyers show, which was highly entertaining.If you get to volunteer at these shows , it makes it even more memorable.You can but bird feed to feed birds which is an awesome experience.The place is well kept."
,,A must see attraction,5.0,,"When in Singapore, you must not miss the Jurong Bird Park. Better to start early in the day to make full use of your visit. You will see lot of bird species here which you might not have heard/ thought of."
,,Worth the Visit,5.0,,"The Highlight of the place are the bird shows, make sure you get to volunteer during the shows :)
You will definitely get your money's worth. Very educational, interesting and worthwhile to visit.
You'd spend about 4-5 hours and kids will surely enjoy a trip to Jurong Bird Park."
,,Sounds Silly But This Place Is Cool,5.0,,I love coming here and wandering around. I try to stop by here and the Orchid Garden every single trip. I am a bird lover thanks to my Grandmother and you get to see a little bit of everything here. They even have shows with birds doing tricks and other stunts. Even the most hardened tourist would love this place at least once. I try to do a few exotic things every trip when I travel and I suggest this place on many levels and again it is really cool to spend an hour ot two here.
,,Great show of Birds,4.0,,The main attraction of the Jurong Bird Park is the Bird show. It's a really very good show of birds. There is so many rear species birds is available.
,,Very Birdy!!,5.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is an awesome place for bords. There are numerous places for different birds like toucans, flamingoes and penguins. There is even a feeding place for parakeets. Kids enjoy this attraction as well as adults."
,,Fun time,4.0,,"Our hotel was on Orchard Street so we had a 30 minute taxi ride to park. No public transportation available. This added $40 dollars to cost, plus $60 for two tickets for total of $100 for the two hours we spent in the park. It was very interesting and I enjoyed it but not sure it was worth the monies spent. We arrived after the shows so I cannot comment on those. We were a party of two adults."
,,Great fun,5.0,,"My kids just loved it... Right from the tram ride.. to the pictures with the birds, the various sites, and the waterfall... Do not miss the various bird shows, check for timings beforehand, do not miss them... Great fun..."
,,Overall pretty good,4.0,,"Pretty good day out. Stayed about two hours. Sadly we got there just after 11am and there were no more shows until 3pm so missed seeing any demonstrations.

The tram is worth the money but was very hectic and had to wait a while to get one as so busy.

The birds are well kept with beautiful cages which was great to see.

Food choices for lunch was dismal,this needs improving."
,,Amazing display of Hornbills and Toucans,5.0,,We visited the bird park with our two young children and had an awesome day. You could easily spend a full day at the park. Lots of amazing birds to see and excellent shows throughout the day. We especially loved the Hornbill and Toucan displays. Travel to the bird park from the city via MRT and bus was efficient and easy. Would definitely recommend a visit to the bird park as part of your visit to Singapore!
,,Colourful birds and stunning shows,5.0,,The variety of colourful birds here leaves one speechless. Do attend the various shows around the park as they are mind boggling!
,,This is the great and best of Singapore nature,5.0,,"Instead of going to the botanic gdns orr the awful trees near marina this is the real nature of singapore. We have been here manybtimrs, it allows attracts. We strongly advise you to go there if you want to see thevtop attraction. Its a bit far though, so go mrt."
,,Just another caged park,3.0,,After visiting Zoo and the night safari I had high hopes about the zoo. I was little disappointed to see the same caged birds. Penguin section was the best.
,,kids love it,5.0,,my kids loved the place and the activities inside it . if you have children then i would advise you to go.
,,Really great for birders,5.0,,"Ok, it's a bummer to get to but worth it as the birds are not prisoners being free to fly and you can walk around this mini forest and see them at super close range"
,,Interesting display of birds,4.0,,"Takes time to view the park , plan your half day plus for this park. Prefer to take tram to take you around the park unless you are sure of walking around the entire park. The collection of birds is awesome and this might be good place for bird lovers to visit."
,,I expected more...,3.0,,"If you are going to choose between singapore zoo and bird park, I definitely recommend you the zoo!!
You won't miss any thing if you don't visit bird park.
It's too big and access to the cages are difficult even by tramp.
I got sad after visiting, I didn't expect some low quality things from singapore bird park.
For example there was a pungent smell around flamingos pound or the most of the vitrine's windows of bird discovery center were covered by steam and it was hard to see what's inside.
The shows were interesting don't miss them.
The design of the park is nice and unique and suitable for photography."
,,Great Place for All Ages !!,5.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is one of the best places to visit here in Singapore. They have a great collection of a variety of species of birds, with lots of rare ones that you don't get to see otherwise. Plenty of photo ops also (especially with some of the birds) and they also have great shows throughout the day."
,,So colourful!,5.0,,"My family,(a party of five,) went to the bird park. The bird park had lots of kinds of birds and the birds were also really pretty. The bird exhibits were very interesting bird trick show. I loved it a lot! I also could see that the zookeepers/birdkeepers did their part and took care of them and loved them. I really enjoyed the Jurong bird park! It was super duper fun!"
,,Fun Day at Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"This is a great Bird Park to visit.
We started the visit off with a tram ride around the park. Unfortunately the tram ride is not included in the admission price so we had to pay $5 per person to ride.

There are simply hundreds of birds to see. There are opportunities to feed the birds yourself (in Lory Loft) and to watch bird feeding.

The High flyers Show and the Kings of the Skies Show are enjoyable to watch and well worth seeing.

We spent aproximately 5 hours at the park."
,,Hot tourist spot,3.0,,"We heard so much about this bird park, it is away from the city center, make sure you buy the ticket for the tram it worth the price, exhibits are good but not a whole lot to see and forget about the foods they sell very bad, worth talking the children to go if you have nothing better to do"
,,Colorful Lorries Took My Heart,5.0,,"Your Singapore Visit is incomplete if you don't visit Jurong Bird Park. It's hectic to spend a day in hot and humid weather condition like Singapore. But, looking at the colorful birds you will forget everything. I loved the Lorry Loft most and the feeding sessions. Took some feeding sessions pics with my wife. Oh! It's awesome experience amidst different kinds of birds from all over the world. And, of-course, don't miss out the bird shows."
,,Birds of all kinds and shape....a wonderful gateway in a busy city,5.0,,"Well, its a truly remarkable place with the sole focus being avians. Starting from penguins to owls, one gets to see almost every kind of bird. In this regard, the management of Bird Park has created mini-habitats for the sustenance of all kinds of birds. Thus, it can be a great place to educate yourself or children.

Reaching there in the morning is preferable as one gets to attend to the penguin feeding session, bird shows of more than one type. Such shows are repeated after 1-2 P.M. So plan accordingly.

At the ticket-counter, they offer a tram service for another SG$5/-, which can be taken if you have difficulty in walking as the park is not really too big and can be easily covered on foot. However, the tram is great help for the persons with walking difficulties.

Snacks available in the Bird park are of limited variation and slightly expensive. Its advisable to carry your own snacks as all the walking can make you really hungry.
Staff at the Bird Parks are really friendly. There are designated photo-booths where they click the pics and you get to carry hard copy. However, only if you ask for better deals, they will divulge the 'better options'. So ask and perhaps negotiate a little.

All in all, very unique concept and a good place which can be enjoyed by people of all kinds."
,,Great Place for Kids,4.0,,"My wife, two children and I visited the Jurong Bird Park in June 2016. It is a long MRT ride. There are all sorts of bird exhibits and some bird shows. We especially liked the birds of prey show. This is a very enjoyable place for children in addition to also going to the Night Safari."
,,Oh my my!,5.0,,"What an amazing place! Been there with family a few years back and just can't get over it. Never thought of something like this! Best bird park!So many different beautiful birds with so many fun shows ! A must go! We had a bonus of going during the Chinese new year celebrations period.the tram ride throughout the park was free , otherwise it charges a lot for a group. Would love to visit again!"
,,Must see,5.0,,The variety of birds in their near natural habitat is a feast for the eyes and soul. Dont fit this excursion in a cramped schedule. Take a whole day there if you are a nature lover and even if not you will become one after the visit. The two bird shows we saw were amazing. Don't miss it ever
,,Delightful,5.0,,"Great time, Owl enclosures are superb, the Parrots are fantastic and the flamingos delightful. Went in at 10am and left after 2pm. For bird-lovers, animal-lovers, nature- lovers, families and everyone else!!! A must see! Hot days in Singapore are challenging, so ensure you keep hydrated, wear a hat, sunblock and eat ice cream. Flight of birds were amazing!!!"
,,One of its Kind!!!!!,5.0,,Exceptional is the first word that comes to my mind. I am more of a animal lover than birds but this place changed my mind at least for that day. Jurong bird park has almost 400 species of birds out of which 29 are endangered. They have some great shows like the High fliers show and the birds of prey show. Excellent outing attraction to spend your day if you are a nature lover.
,,i do like it..,4.0,,"it is a good park, it has multiple birds with various kinds of shows. It is massive and it is a bit old. I have been told that it is moving close to the Zoo.. I hope they create something even better than now....must must visit"
,,Unexpectedly amazing experience ...!!!,4.0,,"it was the last day of our trip and we were a lot tired. decided to skip it but then eventually went. Thought that might be a boring bird sanctuary but turned out amazing locomotive ride, excellent talented bird shows. Dont miss the shows... they are the gem of whole experience...."
,,Kids Dream world,5.0,,A must visit place for the kids to see how well Singapore are making effort to look after the animals which in few years may be extinct if not preserved.
,,Hated it,2.0,,This visit reduced me to tears particularly the penguin display (I can't even call it an enclosure) and the owls. The birds looked distressed and the aviaries for the larger birds seemed too restricted. So sad.
,,Amazing experience!,5.0,,"Must visit, specially for kids. Lorry Loft, waterfall and bird shows are the highlights! Keep aside 3to 4 hrs. for the visit."
,,Good if you want to see birds,4.0,,This is an excellent place for children to see different species of birds.. Can skip this if you're not a nature/bird lover..
,,Great park but changed compared to last time,3.0,,"It was great as there were so many species of birds and was quite amazed at the owl exhibits and there was a musuem to learn more facts about birds as well.

However, the attraction that I was most looking forward to, which was the Lory Loft, as I had a lot of memories as a child there, was quite disappointing as there aren't many birds compared to last time, and it was hard to try to get birds to even eat or come near you, which I felt I wasted money to buy the food (which was some liquid compared to seeds last time and the liquid attracted a LOT of bees) and was a disappointing experience, but could be due to the timing that I went which was around afternoon(not sure if it affects). But overall it was a great experience and it's a relaxing place to visit in Singapore."
,,great experience,5.0,,it has multiple birds with various kinds of shows....a unique place and concept...visited birds park several times and do it again without hesitance.....must must visit
,,A beautiful bird park..,5.0,,"Very beautiful park! I was really amazed at how well this park has been maintained. It's so clean, green and beautiful. And to see almost all the birds around the world at just one place is such a pleasure. There are also some shows arranged by the park authority that show up these birds performing some stunts. It was an amazing place to be. One note for all the tourists, please don't throw plastics or any other find of wastes in ponds/on pathway. It is an offense and a really sad situation to see a beautiful place like this which is a habitat to these innocent birds in a mess. Be thoughtful and enjoy the place."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Must visit it. Very big bird park i have ever visited. So many species of birds.. bird show is good thing.. waterfall aviary section was awesome. Must see.
,,Exotic birds,3.0,,"The penguins, Horn Bills are splendid and not seen often. The show at amphitheatre is really good. Ensure you are there by 15:00 hrs to experience it daily ."
,,Welcome to the bird's world,5.0,,It has more than 8000 bird species here. Enjoy the birds sing and you can feed its. After that join a show which you can see the birds are so smart
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"Easy to access, nice place for sight seeing and see various kind of birds. With children they can feed bird at Lori Loft. I do not know the name of the bird, they are very colorful. But you have to buy the feeding from the counter."
,,Great day out.,4.0,,"We purchased our admission tickets from hotel tour desk to save queuing on arrival. Then caught a taxi be aware you pay a small taxi levy if you travel before 9.30am. Alternatively you can travel by bus, it's only a short walk from the main road bus stop to the park entrance. Grab a park brochure when you enter it contains the park map, show and feeding times. We were not part of an organised tour to we were able to take out time and managed to fit in the High Flyers Show at 11am, located in the Amphitheatre. The park itself is well set out and easy to walk around, or you can catch the park tram, fare included in admission fee, jump off when you please.The park has ample restrooms, shelters, food and drink facilities. Our favourite stop was the Waterfall Aviary (station 3), which is around the half way point and contains the waterfall cafe. After leaving the park we waiting around 20 minutes for a cab due to the location being away from the main road, our visit was a weekday, you can also walk to the main road a catch a bus. Take your time, there is a lot see, I cannot comment on the size of weekend crowds."
,,Lovely gardens and displays.,3.0,,"It's a very pretty garden park, sometimes so bushy you can't see the birds! I would have liked to get closer to macaws etc but the ones displayed were there if you wanted a paid photo. The flight show was great."
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,Very accessible location. Ticket prices are also very reasonable. Certainly value for money for visitors.
,,A must see if you like birds or wildlife,5.0,,"We took a group of ten to see the park because we are all nature lovers and especially appreciate birds. The park was excellent, it had a large variety of birds from around the world, and had shows throughout the day to emphasize the park's attempt to educate park goers about the need for conservation and the impact that environmental damage has on birds and the prey that they rely on for survival.

The interactive opportunities for the crowd was a unique part of the experience: one of our group was selected to have a turkey vulture land on her arm and to actually get to feed it as well. The High Flyer show was excellent!!!

Pros:
Excellent park for nature enthusiasts and families, interactive opportunities for park goers, large variety of tropical birds as well as birds that are not native to the area. Sustainability education and very knowledgable staff.

Cons:
A little far from the city"
,,Nice place for bird lovers,4.0,,"It a wide variety of birds, Lory loft is superb and the breeding center is exceptionally good. Recommended for families and bird lovers."
,,High flyers show is the best,5.0,,to get here we took the MRT to boon lay and then took the connecting bus 194 from bus interchange gate no B8. Very far so keep aside one hour to travel from orchard road. We missed the kings of the skies show. High flyers show was fantastic! Wear comfortable clothing. its very hot esp during the shows. Wear a mosquito patch too to avoid some bites. We ate at pizza hut and is a good bet fro vegetarians. Lory loft is superb and the breeding center is exceptionally good. So so informative.
,,Good day out,5.0,,Visited 4 weeks ago on a very rainy day Best selection if birds I've ever seen Well looked after Recommend for families
,,Great place especially for bird lovers,4.0,,Has a large variety of birds. Also there are few huge enclosures where the birds are let loose and you can see the birds from a close distance. Kids for sure will love it.
,,Very Nice,5.0,,This place is very good for people who are interested in Bird Sighting & enjoy the nature. The Pools Amphitheater is a must watch.
,,Loved the penguin display,4.0,,Spent about 4 hours at the park. Make sure you get there early so that you can see the birds of flight shows. If you have trouble walking distances pay $5 to catch the small tram that travels around the park. However it only stops at set locations so have a look when you first enter the park to work out when to get off etc as there is some hills which may be ok for walking down but not so easy coming back up. Make sure you don't miss the penguin display which is an inside attraction. Really cute where you can watch them swimming and just standing around looking at each other. You can walk through some of the cages which is also really good.
,,Great for the whole family.,4.0,,I would recommend feeding the birds. It is a small amount to pay but we enjoyed it. Plan you day if you want to see shows as well. Enjoyed my time there.
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"The park is a great place to visit for both singles, couples and families. Lots of interesting birds and the bird shows are well worth seeing. A very well developed and landscaped park making it easy to get around."
,,Feather Friends Day,5.0,,My daughter and I enjoyed the show. The birds are so cute especially when Amigo the talking parrot sung.My little girl was so amazed in feeding the birds too.Jurong Bird Park is a must to visit when you are in Singapore.
,,Bird watchers Paradise,4.0,,"Considered a bird watchers paradise, Jurong Bird Park in fabulous Singapore is the world's largest. With more than an astounding 600 different kinds of species, the park provides a wide array of shows and attractions that are sure to educate even the most avid bird-watcher."
,,Make sure you have insect repellant with you.,5.0,,"The mosquitos are the only irritant here. But then it is a tropical rainforest atmosphere. The variety of birds could be expanded. Hopefully it will be in the next few years. There is a plan afoot to move this park closer to the zoo. That would be really great, as the visitors could then spend the whole day in the zoo and the bird park. The children had a great time."
,,Must visit. Well maintained.,5.0,,"One of the good attraction in Singapore. Through Voyagin.com we booked online ticket which is cheap compare to buy on the spot.( almost 14S$ difference) and Tram ride was included.Bird park is well maintained .try to reach morning hours. Shows were good . Keep water with u.morning went to jurong bird park-Rocher MRT to Boon Lay station. From there 194 number bus. Keep change to pay. Better to buy city pass. ( we realize later).
Morning we went to jurong and then enjoyed PRATA at mall. Evening went to garden by the bay. Utilized our time well and enjoyed."
,,"Needs more birds, and mozzie prevention measures!",3.0,,"The parrots were a delight, as were the owls and penguins but there was no proper policing or staff checking on how some other tourists were walking around banging on exhibits and cages, and the Andean Condors and similar enclosures were quite small for the birds in question.
PS: make sure you bring bug spray!"
,,Planned a half day spent the whole day,5.0,,"Loved it - the parrot show In the morning set the tone - what an entertaining session - one of the best things I have seen in ages.

So easy on the MRT to get out there.

We bought the two parks pass for $49 each on line (10% cheaper) and used bar code on confirmation email via mobile phone."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"It's a big bird park, fun for all age , lot of birds , birds shows ,tram ride , lot of greenery , water fountain ,there is no metro near the park ,taxi is the best choice but you can go by bus that is cheep but take more time,must see attraction,need1/2 day."
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,Another nice attraction Singapore offers for their visitors. My favorites are the Colorful Parrots and the Flamingos. You can see lots and lots of birds here and there's a separate wet playing area for kids. I witnessed kids having so much fun over there. As in any other attraction this too has a great educational value for kids apart from the great fun and entertainment they provide. Don't miss out to take your kids for a day in the Jurong Bird Park while you are in Singapore.
,,Different birds at one place,3.0,,"This place is good for natural lovers, as one can find different birds and there research. It is accessible through metro and bus station."
,,Beautiful human friendly Birds,5.0,,"I had always dreamed some day birdrs should eat from my hand and my dream came true when I visited Jurong Bird Park. Lot of birds around you, Flamingo to see all together is also an awesome experience."
,,Expansive!,5.0,,"It had many varieties of birds and was expansive. We had taken a 4 park pass (Park Hopper Plus) which included tram ride. Tram has 4 stations and goes by frequently. Given the amount of walk required, its a good idea to take the tram ride especially if you have kids. Our favorite was the Lorry feeding where we fed the birds and they sat on our hands, shoulders and even head!! Among the shows, high flyers show was wonderful. We enjoyed the birds of prey show too.

You can carry food and water inside; though there are water dispensers around. There are a few eateries inside and to our surprise; one had biryani too. Both veg and non-veg biryani were decent (~10 SGD) and the quality was large.

We took a cab to go there because we didn't want to spend time travelling on metro (it would have taken 1.5hrs from Little India after changing lines twice and taking a bus). While coming back, we did take a bus + metro route. Its not strenuous; though time-taking. Bus stop is outside the bird park on the main road."
,,A park with many species of birds and exciting activities,4.0,,This is a must see if you are visiting with kids. The talk shows by the birds are enchanting and some thing new . Lot of fun filled activities for the children.
,,Best collection of birds from around the world!,5.0,,"The last of the 3 major attractions (Singapore Zoo & Night Safari) in Singapore would be the Jurong Bird Park. It is now the world-famous bird zoo where there are specimens of magnificent bird life from around the world, including a large flock of flamingos.

It is currently the world's largest bird park in terms of the number of birds, and second largest both in the number of bird species and land area. There are about 5,000 birds and about 400 different species residing in Jurong Bird Park, of which 29 are of threatened species.

This place is great for picnics with the family as well as the many activities that are available and fun to attend to!

Great place for your foreign friends that you should bring them to as well!"
,,JURONG BIRD PARK,5.0,,"JURONG BIRD PARK is a must visit attraction in Singapore & whether old or young is absolutely a fantastic attraction & possible the best bird park in the world. The huge numbers of bird species you can see up closely is fantastic. The avaries are in deed huge & so well appointed. Same with the enclosures you can walk in & be up close & personal with the birds. Beautiful, clean outstanding.
There's a huge man made waterfall in a jungle setting & it's truly unbelieveable. The photo's you can take will give you amazing memories of Jurong. The walkways are safe & easy. Steps easy to climb, even for an oldie like me. But, for $5 extra when paying for admission to the park you can travel around & see the park at ease. Hoping on & off at different stations to then look at the birds on display."
,,One of best experiments of life,5.0,,"I love this place - it's a sanctuary ! It's sad to see birds in captivity but this is the best place there is for birds in captivity.
The high flyers show is jaw dropping - these birds are so well trained it's unbelievable. You will get to see such an amazing collections of birds. I have never see so many different kinds of birds before and not known their names as well. It was a knowledgeable experience for me.
Birds are pretty- you will love this place.

This is a whole day activity make sure you go there from the morning and spend the whole day because this place is massive. Take your time to explore. There are plenty of places to dine in so don't worry about food. There are transport inside the place if someone has mobility issues they can just hop onto their park bus (I don't remember their exact name).
A must see place of Singapore highly recommended it."
,,Up close with birds,4.0,,"I picked up a leaflet for this park at another attraction I was very pleasantly surprised at work inside up close and personal with the birds. For a nominal fee you can buy some food and encourage the parents to interact with you. I watched and into resting talk about pelicans and learnt many new fact I didn't know, there was a flying display in a specially built amphitheatre, with birds flying low over the audience heads. The only thing I didn't like about this parkwere the birds classified as raptors like vultures were in very small enclosures and we're pacing in boredom. When you compare it to the rest of the park kind of feel that maybe they need to deal with the situation. One of the walking aviaries included a waterfall, and the whole aviary seemed bigger than our local park. Great park I would give it five out of five if it sorts out it's raptor cages."
,,Must visit place,5.0,,"Amazing place so many species of birds , different types of different birds , must visit if you are visiting with children's !"
,,Great for kids,5.0,,Went alone but all could think was visiting the place again with my son .Absolutely must visit for a perfect family day . Many bird shows and you can feed them too
,,Lovely place to visit with kids,4.0,,"We visited the bird park and didn't regret it at all. Some of the sections worth visiting are breeding section, ostrich, swan / ducks, parrots,penguins. Some sections like Vultures can be avoided. Do not forget to take tram pass, as the bird park has elevations to travel. Souvenir collection is good. Photo shoot with birds are also nice."
,,Must do for families,4.0,,"If you are traveling with your family, this is a place one must visit. The Bird-show is a visual delight. The souvenir store is slightly on the expensive side."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"If you love birds you have to come here. Plenty of the usual water birds, flamingoes, pelicans, etc, but the highlight are the free flying enclosures. Feed the parrots and have them land on you, especially your head."
,,Lovely place. Must visit,4.0,,Beautiful place and extremely well maintained. Exciting experience of feeding beautiful birds who sit all over your hands and shoulders as you feed them.
,,Bring SWIMMING COSTUMES if you have kids under 12 years,4.0,,"There are lots of birds, from penguins to owls, hornbills, flamingoes, lories, ibis, ostriches... High Flyer Show at 11am & 3pm daily, and Owl/ Vultures/ Condor show (forgot the name) at 10am & 4pm daily...

For kids under 12 years, there is also a water play area called Birds of Play... PARENTS PLEASE BRING SWIMMING COSTUMES for your kids... the lifeguards do not allow kids on the slides if they are not wearing swimming costumes. Especially parents of girls, if you forget to bring, there is a shop nearby to buy swim wear. Please note that there are lots of male strangers in the play area, so it's not good for girls, especially older girls, to be topless. I'm highlighting this because everyone just associates the Bird Park with birds (naturally) but when kids see the water play area, they will definitely want to head in. So parents, please be prepared.

The other thing to note is that there are lots of mosquitoes. Please prepare your mosquito repellents and tiger balms. Maybe there are more mosquitoes this month because its rainy season."
,,High Flyer show,5.0,,"It's good attraction for kids, they have tram ride and various shows, better to select proper shows as per timing. High flyer show is must see"
,,Close to the nature,4.0,,Fantastic variety of birds and shows . Up close and personal experience feeding the lory and other beautiful birds of feathers
,,Educational Experience,4.0,,"The Bird Park was not the top of my list of things to do in Singapore; however, I am glad I experienced it. The park includes so many different types of birds that it became an exciting educational experience for me. It was very hot in the park. To tour the entire park too about 3.5 hours with out the use of the tram. Some of the most beautiful and exotic birds in one habitat. Worth visiting. Be sure to stop at the Jurong mall on the way."
,,nice place,4.0,,Nice park with lots of birds to see withh well maintained place . staff are having great time with birds.
,,Loved it,5.0,,"Had been to the other 3 zoos and finished off with the Jurong bird park. Initially, wondered if it was worth it ( as takes a while to get there on train and bus ) but so glad that I did. Was well worth the travel time and effort.
If you take public transport, make sure you know the bus number as its not signposted like the other zoos and ask the driver where to get off as its en route, not at the end of the bus line like the other zoos.
Saw some amazing birds. Beautiful colours of all the birds, especially the parrots. There are several walk through aviaries and an amazing enclosure with huge waterfall and abundance of beautiful coloured birds inside. Saw some birds that I has never seen before - a toucan, some hornbill ( amazing looking creatures ), amazing snow owls, bright flamingos.
Make sure that you see the parrot show - these birds are so clever, so colourful and just amazing to watch. Was lucky enough to get one to sit on my arm - was the highlight of my trip there.
It takes a good few hours to walk around and really appreciate the beauty of the environment and the birds. Well worth the effort and highly recommend it."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Amazing Experience. My both Kids enjoy a Lot. Amazing Experience to remember of Parrot Food Feeding. Great Bird Show. Amazing work by Staff of Park
,,Birds Birds and more Birds,5.0,,"Excellent excursion if you are with young kids. The place is spotless, birds are well managed and the shows are entertaining. A must visit for young kids and families. Do take some more time on hand to visit this as the place is huge. We loved the Flamingos."
,,Beautiful birds never seen before,5.0,,Singapore has specialty in keeping the best of animals and birds. Do visit the Jurong Bird park if you are bird lovers and even if you are not as they have unique birds and big ones too. Eye catchy and photogenic.. specially the Owls were so good that we kept staring for long mutually.. hehe
,,jurying bird park,5.0,,beautiful place . loved all the exhibits specially the penguin area and the artificial waterfall made...... can get a little tiring on a hot day but the birds just take away your tiredness. kids and adults both have equal fun.
,,Fantastic for bird lovers or just animal lovers,5.0,,"Unfortunately it was pouring with rain for nearly all of our visit here, however we tried not to let this affect our visit too much. The birds certainly didn't care that it was raining. I was so impressed with the way all the exhibitions were put together, all of the birds had ample room in their aviaries and looked very well treated. There was a lot to see. The lorikeet area where you could feed them was a highlight, the birds are quite tame and cheeky, one decided to sit on my shoulder for a good ten minutes and give me a new hairstyle. They have photgraphers in the area and you can buy the photos they take, I ended up buying one as it was very good.
We didn't get to see the shows due to the weather however I am sure they would have been good."
,,Worth a visit to the bird park,5.0,,"Bird park is set within lovely peaceful gardens. There are a lot of open aviaries which tourists can walk through and get a closer look/ interaction with the birds.The highlight was an aviary with a very large man made waterfall, beautiful mountainous foliage and birds flying free. There is also a lake with many flamingoes and Pelicans. Also, plenty of cafes/ restaurants to eat ,some allow interactions with parrots."
,,Wow place...,5.0,,"The birds are not in a cage, but in open enclosures. That way, if feels more of a natural habitat rather than a zoo or a cage.

The shows are fabulous. You can even volunteer in one of the shows. My wife did so, and we managed to click some awesome pics.

Word of caution. It can be quite humid. So keep your self hydrated."
,,Good park,5.0,,"My daughter loved this park especially the lory loft where you can feed the lorikeets and they land on you. I have not seen such a big smile on my daughters face in a long time.
The park is set in spacious rainforest type gardens and its amazing how many flamingos they have.
Its a pity the park is moving to the Singapore zoo area as I cant see them devoting the space the park currently has so it will possibly not be as good once it moves."
,,Amazing experience!,5.0,,"The park is beautifully done and has good connectivity through a buggy ride which halts at appropriate point for visitors to refresh and have snacks. The buggy has an audio system as a guide and gives you a real time updates as you move through the park!

The park also has a hanging bridge and you can also feed the beautiful birds! A highly recommended visit, if you are in Singapore!"
,,Nice Place for Bird Lovers,4.0,,Nice place for bird lovers and children will specially enjoy since there is a place in the park for them too.
,,Great bird park,4.0,,Pretty great bird park enjoyed the show they put on. Spent a couple of hours here. Lots to see! We enjoyed the various toucans and birds of prey. Lots of walking though even though they offer a few tram rides.
,,Great shows!,5.0,,"Had a great day watching the bird shows and feeding lorikeets, plus heaps of displays that are well done, very enjoyable"
,,Great for kids and adults alike,4.0,,Highlight was feeding the Lories. Keep 3-4 hours to do justice to it. And the hop-on hop-off train is a must do - great way to see the whole park.
,,Apart from bird feeding not much for small children,3.0,,"We were there on rainy day. Most shows were canceled and birds were not visible in most places. Bird feeding experience was nice, but most birds are overfed and show little interest. Kids would enjoy. Lots of walking. Wear good shoes."
,,Great day out,5.0,,We had the 4 park pass and this was our first stop. The park has a great layout and such a huge range of birds to see! The shoes were fantastic especially for kids and there was plenty of places to eat and drink on site. Highly recommend.
,,Great fun!,5.0,,"While the park is located quite far from the city center, it is well worth it and plan to enjoy half a day here. The waterfalls and aviaries are great! There is a taxi stand just outside if you want to then move along to another sight in the city or just back to a subway stop."
,,Sweet lories,5.0,,"I loved flamigoes, parrots and the colourful lories. You can feed birds and let them eat from your hand."
,,Fabulous half day activity for bird lovers and families with children.,5.0,,"This Asia's largest bird park houses collection of over 5,000 colorful birds from 400 species, across over 20.2 hectares of exploratory landscapes, naturalistic environments and giant walk-in aviaries. Park opens 8:30am-6:00pm daily. If you're coming with children, don't forget to bring along their swimwear so they can play freely at the Birdz of Play wet-play area (11:00am-5:30pm (weekdays))."
,,Good Bird Park,5.0,,"This Bird Park is one of Singapore's 4 zoos, and it's a bit smaller than Singapore Zoo. There's a tram ride that takes you around for an overview of the zoo (we got 1 round trip only), so I guess it's better to just walk. Allot a half-day for walking through all the areas."
,,Outstanding,4.0,,"Spent a couple of wonderful hours with my young family exploring the park. My children never lost interest as there was so much to see and do. The 11am show is outstanding.
I went to the park many years ago and was then far from impressed. The changes have made the bird park world class.
A well worth visit"
,,A wide variety of birds in one place,4.0,,A great experience to see so many different kinds of birds located in one place. Both adults and kids will enjoy visiting this park. There are bird shows at 11.00 and 3.00. Plan your visit to see any one of these shows. For people who cannot walk the entire park there is a tram(charged) that takes you to the various points in the part on a hop-on-hop-off basis.
,,A great day out if you love birds,5.0,,"I have been here a dozen times with my daughters - there is so much to do and its a great attraction. There are lots of shows and if you are keen, you can get up on stage. The birds are wonderful"
,,Excellent Day Trip For Kids and Adults,5.0,,Excellent Day Trip For Kids and Adults. Kid's park is evening more amazing. Colorful birds and good shows. A Must See.
,,Famous bird park of Singapore,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is one of the most famous international attraction of Singapore. The park is very big and has monorail for going from one part to another part. It has big collection of birds. Also, there is a one hour show which is organised everyday to show case amazing plays done by the birds. Option of Night Safari is also available and is linked by many visitors."
,,Great variaty for bird lovers !!!,5.0,,"Definitely a highlight of my trip through Singapore.

The parks variety of bird species was truly magnificent. Loved the Asian walk through aviary and the beautiful waterfall aviary. facilities were all clean and well managed. If I was to fault the park it would be on the general signage for a lot of the enclosures which seemed to be a theme in Singapore but a lot of the species I photographed I still do not know.

This is worth a trip to Singapore for any bird lover"
,,Fab experience,5.0,,"We caught the MRT to Boon Bay and then the bus to the park, bus ride was about 10-15mins, not long. The bus stop is just within the MRT station, no need to go outside. We caught bus no 194
The park is huge, we went at 2pm, and was done by 6pm, maybe if we went early then a play area for kids, we could have made a full day of it."
,,Nice place to spend time,4.0,,I viewed this place last year November afternoon with wife and small kid. Excellent place to spend wonderful halfday.
,,Must do for children,5.0,,"The chat with pelicans was great! The waterfall area was awesome as well. A well maintained and nicely organised bird park. The usual suspects like penguins, ostriches and pelicans are all there and some unusual ones like the largest pigeon!"
,,Over hyped place,3.0,,We had great expectations from this place but were disappointed. May be because of the heat. Nothing great.
,,Good place to spend fun time with Family!,4.0,,I visited this place in June 2016 with my parents and my 3 year old daughter. The park has lots of varieties of Birds. I especially recommend the Bird shows (High Flyers Show ) and Bird feeding programs(Lorry Loft). My Daughter and parents thoroughly enjoyed there day. There are lost of ice-creams stalls available to keep the heat down. I recommend this place to people. Also there are good restaurants available. This place can be fully enjoyed if you spend at least 4-5 hrs. All in all it is an interesting place to visit.
,,Lots of Birds !,5.0,,"Excellent Bird Park. Well maintained park with several opportunities for air conditioning rests. One downside is many of the birds are in cages that don't give you good photos of the birds. However, there are many, many places to enjoy the birds in the large expansive aviaries with the birds. Excellent and well worth it. I chose this over the zoo, for time and feel satisfied."
,,strongly advocate not to visit,1.0,,"About 10 years ago this was a very well maintained park. But when I went there this time (2016), I was extremely disappointed. Still it is an nice experience to go into this huge bird cages and to feed the parrots. But all other installations and cages are way too small, run-down and dirty. There was a larger lake that became a stinky green swamp with a way too large crowd of Flamingos. Many cages are empty and nearly all cages are too small and dirty. It is unbearable to see the beautiful Aras, Parrots and the large birds of pray being kept in this small cages. Without going into the critical issue of zoological parks, this park particular became unacceptable. I strongly advocate not to visit the park and not to support this abuse of birds with buying a ticket."
,,Good time!,4.0,,had a lot of fun at the jurong bird park at singapore. loved the birds and also clicking pictures with them.
,,Just amazing if you are a bird lover,5.0,,"I would rate Jurong Bird Park among the top tourist destinations of Singapore (which boast of a long list) and should not be skipped at any rate.

The variety and number of birds are just mind blowing and you can spend the entire day hoping around from one bird zone to the other till you can walk no more but there are more to see.

It is very difficult to choose which I liked the most, all of them are fantastic, but probably ""Lorry loft"", ""Horn-bills and Toucans"" and ""Heliconia Walk"" deserves special mention and do plan yourself not to miss the ""High Flyers Show"" - just amazing.

Again please don't plan for half a day tour, you would miss a lot if you do so. Plan for full day tour and there is decent restaurants inside which serve good food."
,,Interesting and very good displays,4.0,,"Firstly, if you go make sure you wear mosquito repellent! I ended up with 11 bites after a few hours there. But my fault for not wearing repellent. Having said that it was very interesting and the displays, although quite Americanised, were very entertaining. There are a few cafes dotted about for drinks and nibbles. You can walk round or get the tram. There is a bit of an incline as you go thunder but it was easily manageable for a 58 and a 60 year old!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Very neatly maintained aviaries. Some of them are like natural habitats. The tram service helps avoid sore feet. A great variety of birds, flightless birds etc. Live shows are great. The bird trainers are very knowledgeable."
,,wow,5.0,,great collection of birds and awesome experience if you have a family with kids. lots of walking but overall a great experience
,,Most underrated park in Singapore.,5.0,,"Singapore Zoo and Night Safari are great, River Safari not so much...The bird park however is underrated, it is well worth a visit, even thou it is not located with the rest. Excellent collection of species and good shows."
,,"you name it,they have it! all the birds!",5.0,,"beautiful birds,well organised area,large enclosures,perfect trail,clean washrooms! it requires good 2-3 hours to explore the entire area! but its totally worth!"
,,Umpteenth trip to this attraction,5.0,,"Be prepared to allow four hours for this west of Singapore attraction. Served by buses (connecting to the Nearby MRT) and taxis.

Greeted on entry by penguins right and left. You can tour clockwise (most people go this way and so does the transport for those who find walking in 30 degrees celcius and 90% humidity).

There are many highlights- 3 or four shows. Feeding the birds (penguins and Loris are recommended). Walking inside the huge aviary is a good way to get up close and personal. Check out the characters in pink (flamingos).

There is a good variety of food and beverages near the entrance after the shop."
,,family picnic place,4.0,,many varieties of birds to see.bird feeding and some shows are awesome.i suggest two to three hours is enough for this place.normally smal kids enjoy here.
,,Bit run diwn,3.0,,I was a bit disappointed. I thought there would be more walk through and more hands on. Most are in cages and the shows are their attraction. On entry you can have your picture taken but not with the macaws. As I own a macaw(12mths old) I wanted a pic with the red or blue but that was a no go! Extremely disappointed.
,,Nice place especially for the family . But have to bear the heat under the hot sun.,3.0,,Visited there as kids enter free for this Oct. Nice place especially for the family . But have to bear the heat under the hot sun . Foods Inside a bit expensive.
,,a park exclusively for birds!,5.0,,it's really wonderful to see all different birds all at once. there are places that you can feed the birds as well. Too bad that it will be closed for a while due to moving but I'm sure it will be better than it was.
,,fabulous place for bird lovers,5.0,,"you will love this place if you love birds, beauty of nature, varieties of colorful birds, you can feed few, good place for family and kids, the place is bit out of city but worth visiting once."
,,a Wide variety of bird species,4.0,,Houses a wide variety of bird species . Collection of rare interesting birds . Must visit for a Nature loving person to see the wonders of nature. A bit far off from the city.
,,Family fun,4.0,,"Its really an attractionsfor family, you can teach your children about bird, such pinguin,parrot etc And you can feed the parrot, just buy the food 3$"
,,Highlight of Singapore,5.0,,Amazing place especially for bird enthusiasts and children . Remember to take tram tickets along with Visit tickets . On hot day it would be very difficult to bear heat . Try visiting as early as possible. Take juice and snacks if you are with kids . Inside its little expensive. Avoid paid photo with birds as it is at a nominal cost anyway
,,so so...,3.0,,it was ok. please skip the lunch with the parrots. that was just terrible. and the food was inedible.
,,Wonderful day out,5.0,,"This is a fabulous day out and should not be missed. Beautiful facilities, amazing variety of birds and a fabulous play/water park for the kids. Don't miss it."
,,Surprise with unexpected fantasy of birds,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is most oldest zoo in Singapore.

It was really awesome that so many kinds of birds were living in one place.

And you could play around with birds by feeding them some snacks.

Hope the nature here would really relax your minds and refresh everything.

This place will move right near to Singapore zoo by 2018, so no longer you could see the birds there.

Hence, get the ticket and run on immediately."
,,Vast range of birds to see,4.0,,"If you like birds, this is a must-see! The park was built quite a long time ago and it does show it's age, but it was still a charming and wowing experience. Wouldn't recommend the shows, just explore and enjoy seeing heaps of birds you probably haven't seen before. Transport to and from the park is fairly easy from Boon Lay bus interchange."
,,"Under rated , but a fantastic place",5.0,,"It is a great park . For people like me from India , it was a unique experience . The larry loft (which allows you to actually feed the birds ) is the highlight . Well maintained and some of the species there are rare and views are excellent . Should spend 3-4 hours here to experience it perfectly. genrally you will get combined online passes for Jurong , zoo , night safari and river safari/river cruise"
,,Superb Day Out,5.0,,Enjoyed our visit to the Bird Park. To see birds from all over the world and learn about the pet trade and other educational things about the birds of world. The staffs knowledge is great and they are all willing to answer questions and are quite obviously happy at their work.
,,Best Bird Park Ever,4.0,,"It's really amazing and the kids love it we attend one show at 4pm for king of sky and was excellent
The have penguin and flamingo lake so romantic and the best thing is the waterfall area very beautiful we spent 25 minutes there watching the beauty of nature there is also tram if you get tired specially with young kind we enjoy for 3 hours we set in the coffee to eat ice cream and little snack

You should see it"
,,Expected betger,3.0,,"As quoted,most spectacular bird park in the world,it's definitely not. Most of the birds were ill fed and were crying vociferously for food. Their boisterous noises were evident of the fact that park keepers definitely didn't look after them well. Not the best collection and definitely not a good outing for a sunny day. Prefer winter season to visit here and is steep priced for what they offer inside. Not happy."
,,An oasis of paradise,5.0,,"This is a wonderful park; so many beautiful birds, and the location is lovely. They are interested in conservation which is so very important. There are wonderful things for young children here too, so for all ages this is a must."
,,cant imagine what these birds can do.. too good,5.0,,we were astonished by what we saw at Jurong bird park.. the Bird show was amazing.. it so good to see how they follow instructions.. and Lorry Loft was an ultimate experience of how we feed birds.. to good
,,A poorer cousin to the other attractions,3.0,,"Suggest to go to this place first before others. This bird park had been around for more than 45 years and it's showing ... though you can tell a lot of effort still goes to the feather friends to maintain an enjoyable visit. Also u can tell there have been constant upgrading to upkeep the interest of this place. The two shows are alright, some parts are actually quite impressive but pale in comparison to the zoo and night safari. Also little interactive between the birds and visitors. The children water play and playground are loads of fun so do plan extra time. We went at 2pm, watch the two shows, spent an hour in the water play and left with very little time to explore and understand the birds. The park closes at 6pm. Looking forward to the move to Mandai, u can bet it will be exciting. So come back in 2020!"
,,A re-visit after 10+ years,3.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park has been renovated some time back and it is definitely not the same when I visited during my childhood time.

It has much more varieties and more organised. It also has playgrounds and water playground to cater for the not-so patient kiddos.

Worth the visit!"
,,Excellent bird park,5.0,,Should not be missed went there as part of 4in1 park hopper plus ticket on a Saturday. Will advise taking the tram and then walking the enclosures. TIP- Get at last stop and walk downhill at last stop and take the tram back from station 3 to the gate. Shows not to be missed.
,,Excellent old-established attraction,4.0,,Jurong Bird Park is a long established attraction with an excellent collection of birds from around the world. A good half a day or even a day visit with frequent buses (Route 194) from and to Boon Lay MRT station.
,,Its good but not excellent,4.0,,"First of all the place is very far from the city and one has to walk a lot to see entire park though there is a tram facility. The main attractions are Eagle show, Penguin Feeding and Parrots/Flamingo Show, apart from these shows the rest may not be that interesting."
,,Embracing the Nature of Birds,5.0,,"I've been to this park five times and I still love it. It is a great fun for families with young children. The highlights of the park are the shows. It has two shows, High Flyers show and King of the Skies show. The shows are breathtaking and unforgettable, especially for me was the part of the High Flyers show when a parrot sang three songs in three different languages. This park contains lots of species of birds and trust me when I say that the Lory Lofts are not to be missed. Visit it if you're in Singapore and I'm sure that it will be a unforgettable memory."
,,"Flying high, enjoyable..",5.0,,"This conservation park is very similar to the world-class Singapore Zoo except that of course it specializes with Birds of unimaginable kinds. Definitely you will find some species that will be a first for you to see making your experience more memorable. Enjoy the hike, just be sure to wear comfortable shoes and clothes as this bird park is huge. And here you will also wonder why some birds don't fly when you know that they actually can. Hmmm? And weather in SG is unoredictable, it usually rains in the afternoon even if it's very hot during the day so better bring an umbrella, it will be very useful. Enjoy the birds!"
,,Wonderful outing,4.0,,"The bird park is very well maintained and it takes about half a day to go through around. On the day we were there, the cool weather was also pleasant for us to walk along the trails. Try going for those shows, they're very nice!"
,,Beautiful Birds,5.0,,"This bird park is huge and should be planned for 1 day.
You have options to feed the birds and take their photographs. Its a great experience. I have never seen such variety of parrots and specifically the 2 bird shows conducted are really fun to watch."
,,A must go with or without kids,4.0,,I am not particularly an animal or bird lover...but this place made me discover my bond with these amazing co-dwellers on this planet of ours...Birds! Do not miss the Lorry Feeding experience....Manage your visit timings to catch the bird shows...you'll be amazed by them!
,,Bad experience at Lunch with Parrots,1.0,,"They took my booking for a Lunch with Parrots. They closed it down for renovation without informing. They did not even refund. They converted it into a parrot show - like one of the free shows. and a separate buffet lunch. The food looked really bad. When we got to the lunch, it was closed.

Also very limited eating options there. Found a burger place there but nothing beg. Vegetarians carry your own food."
,,Birds in Paradise,5.0,,"This is a great place to visit for families or for anyone who wants to see birds in all their wonderful variations. You need about 4 hours to wander around and see everything. Definitely get there to see the bird shows. The one at 11 am with the macaws, parrots etc is worth the price of admission alone. Don't worry about catching the train around the park unless you have difficulty walking. Get one of the 2 or 4 park passes if you have the time to do all the attractions, it will save you quite a bit. Make sure you check the web site for what's currently on. When we were there recently the panda attraction at the zoo was closed. Also if you want to do a night safari, you need to book way in advance. Don't expect that you can just land in Singapore and book it the next day. Pick up a brochure to the park at any tourist place or hotel. Instructions for using the SMRT to get there are on the back of the brochure and they work perfectly."
,,Beautiful Sanctuary,5.0,,"Beautiful day out for families or couples, we recently spent about 4 hours walking around and seeing all the beautiful birds. The enclosures are huge so the birds have lots of room to fly, everything is very clean and well maintained"
,,birds and their shows,5.0,,"be in time to see the bird shows.they r worth it,beautiful.visit every bird section,give yourself time to enjoy their habitat.their food shows r a must and the penguins r the cutest.I enjoyed the 4 parks pass and that proved very cheap but book on line."
,,Pleasant Place,5.0,,"Great place for bird lovers. You can feed birds, put on your hands and click pics. A full day visit is recommended to enjoy all activities. You can relax here as long as you can and should not be missed."
,,A wonderful day,4.0,,"My daughter (8) and me visited the Bird park today for the first time. We spent more than 4 hours there and never got bored or tired. Beautiful enviroment and the most beautiful birds! We enjoyed the shows very much! Try the get to see them all! We didn't take the train that commutes from one part of the park to the other. It's no problem to walk.
We will definitly return one day!"
,,Closer Encounter with the Birds,4.0,,"This review is quite late. The Jurong Bird Park is a good spot for people to interact closely with birds. Shows not to be missed include the Kings of the Skies Show, High Flyers Show, Lunch with Parrots, and High Flyers Show."
,,Amazing Experience,4.0,,Great experience and its amazing that I can see such a great variety of birds in such a small place. High Flyer show is a must-watch! It was so entertaining.
,,Birds! Birds! Birds!,4.0,,This place is for bird lovers! And the bird show was great! There are lots and different kinds of birds to see here. I so love the pink flamingos. They're so lovely to look at. Bring a camera with good lens focus so you can take photos of birds even from afar. The place isn't that big so half a day here would be enough. Better catch the bird show in the morning or you'd wait for the next.
,,First Day Visit,4.0,,We made to this place on our first day as it was too far off from our hotel. We took and MRT ad then a bus connecting to Bird park. It is woht to visit with family and children's. There are lot of attractions within the premises.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"We had visited the bird park some 38 years ago and decided to visit again. An excellent day out.

We decided to spend a few extra $$ and use the Bird from Above tram tour. (Well it was quite a bit more expensive), but very worth while, rather than just seeing the birds our guide stopped at a number of locations and gave a full briefing on the bird, habitat, etc. Added a lot of value to the tour, would highly recommend.

The various shows, ie bird feeding, birds of prey and the others were all worthwhile. The bathroom facilities are very clean and well located.

Highly recommend"
,,wonderful bird park,5.0,,"We go to Singapore each year and have been to this park at least 8 times. Both the adults and kids love it. Like the zoo, the paths provide some nice shade and reasonable amount of walking. Highlight is probably the feeding of the lories which can get a bit crowded on the weekend. We never use the tram and prefer to walk around.

There is a small water park for the kids to cool off in as well.

Buy tickets online to get discounts and save time."
,,Amazing,5.0,,If you are not afraid of birds this is the place to go. You can purchase bird food and watch the birds happily sit on you while feeding.
,,Amazing Experience and a treat to eyes.,5.0,,"You get to unwind your inner child at the bird park with so much colourful birds and the High Flyer show at the pools amphitheater, you forget you are an adult. Lory loft and Owl Caves are a must visit."
,,My 2nd visit - I love it,5.0,,"This place is better than the zoo and night safari, but perhaps I'm biased because I LOVE birds.

I really like seeing the hornbills close-up in the breeding programme. LOVED the owl exhibit too!

Unfortunately many of the birds exhibited were without an informative blurb tablet, so I was disappointed to not be able to identify what I was seeing.

The lorikeet loft walk is lovely when the birds come and eat the nectar from the purchasable cup.

We saw the birds in flight show and it was corny as expected but amusing. Amazing just to see the Hyacinth macaws in flight.

We caught the MRT and then the bus to the attraction and it was easy and cheap.

We found it cheaper to book this attraction online in combination with another park."
,,Good,4.0,,You have variety of birds and most of them are trained. Enjoyed our visit and good place to visit. We have enjoyed the two shows which was great.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,So many birds from parrots to flamingo to ostrich and eagles. All are here and a beautiful presentation in a quiet place. Recommend for all nature lovers and families
,,The best bird park I ever visited,5.0,,There are many kind of birds protected in a natural way. one day is not enough to view this park fully. The show at Amphie theater is superb. My family absolutely loved it.
,,a good day out!,4.0,,it was really fun and cool to see all the birds fly around and feed them even though it was scattered witch was a problem but anyway it was a great time! we will come back!
,,"It is ok, if you look for number of birds, excellent if you like how they promoted it !!!!!!",4.0,,"Ticket: I suggest to buy combo ticket for parks like, Jurong bird park and singapore zoo. You get at discounted price and quite flexible too.

Reaching Jurong park- Suggest to use MRT and Bus combination, quite economic and easy to reach. Taxi would have costed me 30 $ one way, however i spent 5 $ by
MRT and Bus combination and reached the destination in less than 45 minutes.

Nearest attraction near Jurong Bird park- Science center.

Jurong bird park is well maintained bird park with lot of customer friendly facilities, excellent infrastructure, and lots of activities which are thought provocative.
Once you reach park, I suggest you to take a tram ride to understand the geography of the park and shortlist the attractions you would like to focus.
Please go through the activities list and plan your activities in the park.You could walk at leisure and enjoy hopping tram ride to various attractions. Don't miss Wings of Asia, which is very nice and the guide will explain neatly at free of cost.
Food in the park is bit expensive, which is norm in all tourist attractions.
This is in total 3-4 hours activity. Please reach latest by 9 am to park and spend time till 1pm and have lunch to proceed to science center which is 15 minutes drive from taxi at aorund 8-10 $ or by Bus/MRT around 2 $ which takes around 45 minutes. Reach science center by 2 PM."
,,The average attaraction...!!!,4.0,,Crushed my expectations….The birds are looks like trained for human friendly. The bird shows were really interesting…The kids had enjoyed the feeding of birds.
,,Ok,3.0,,"When I heard there was a bird park in Singapore I was excited, as I love birds. I was a tad dissapointed whilst wandering around though honestly. The food was very overpriced, although it did come with a souvenir cup. The park itself was large, and had a few hills. For someone like me who has physical illnesses, I found it difficult in the heat. I did see transportation go past in the grounds, but I couldn't see any signage around as to what it was or the cost if any. I did however see the bird park had wheelchairs and prams for rent which was great. As for the birds, 8 felt a bit sorry for them. Their enclosures seem to have everything they need in there, but some of them seemed a bit cramped. The bird show I saw was good, but it wasn't very interactive with the audience which was a shame, and it seemed that if you got there early and sat up front, then you were punished by not being one of the chosen few who got to interact with the birds. They did however offer free photos at the end, but tbh It felt as if you'd be giving them the rights to use your image by letting them take your photo, and so I sadly declined. Jurong bird park has the makings of a great place, and the staff were lovely for the most part. I hope peoole see the potential in this bird park, and it continues to grow with time and money invested."
,,Hated it,2.0,,This was a huge disappointment. Most of the birds looked stir crazy with not a lot of room to fly around. Smelly and quite dirty surroundings.
,,Suprisingly clean and fun if you love birds,4.0,,"We got the ticket because we bought the 4 for 2 pass and were a bit afraid of stories from people that told us it was a bit outdated and it smells. It was a hot day and I have to say I only smelled the birds once at the flamingo's and the rest of the park was perfectly fine. I also didn't notice too much things were worn off and I think they have put some work in upgrading. What could improve is to make some more water refill stations, especially for hot days. Also don't keep selling the bird food on busy days (weekends) as the birds are overfed and it will be a waste of your $3.- despite what others say on this forum. My 3 and 6 year old were very disappointed with this. For the rest, they had lots of fun and enjoyed it."
,,Great day out,5.0,,A fantastic park for a great day out lovely and shady lots of different bird life avieries to walk through and feeding of birds fantastic.
,,Amazing bird park,5.0,,This place is a must see! One of my favourite things I did in Singapore. The amount of different types of birds is insane. Do not miss the bird shows. They are very impressive and obviously have the birds very well trained.
,,"Wow,great experiance",5.0,,"The best thing I enjoyed in Singapore.The whole park- the landscaping,the aviary,collection of birds all were amazing.Got to spend only one day in the park nd surely will go back soon in my next trip.a must visit place for all who visits Singapore."
,,Interesting bird park,4.0,,"Varieties of birds available. Owls are so beautiful! I reach early in order to finish the park and go for show. Sadly, I didn't manage my time to walk the whole park by foot in order to get closer look for all birds because i took the tram ride. It is due to that day it has heavy rain for a short while, we running out of time for the show, so i decided to go for tram ride. Make sure you bring enough drinking water, umbrella (as there do not have much shade to cover) also a pair comfortable walking shoe. The show is great, i manage to take picture with a herd of flamingo. Tram ride first stop is able to let visitors to feed the bird (bird feed S$3), friendly birds are cute and touching the birds are not advisable as per the park."
,,Exciting variety of birds,5.0,,"As the Park is a distance out of central Singapore, we were pleased that we could use a coach pass for the travelling. The Park is very well laid out and the information on the birds is excellent.
I suggest using the free 'train' to do a loop of the Park to have an idea as to where everything is first. Do not do as we did - start walking, as it is uphill, the weather was hot and humid.
The flamingo pool was a colourful delight. The display of birds, many parrots, a short distance from the flamingo pool, was entertaining, and the birds seemed to enjoy showing off their tricks.
This was an interesting and very well run Park to see a wide variety of birds that I had not seen very often before."
,,Great place for a family day out,4.0,,"Great place for the whole family, seen lots of different birds species.The place is clean and neat with a lot of seating areas. Highly recommend the bird show that runs both in the morning and afternoon. My 3 years old daughter loved the interaction with the birds, the swan lake and waterfall."
,,Just amazing,5.0,,"My son is very fond of birds and animals so it was in our ""must do"" list.but we all enjoyed a lot.especially the pelican feeding show and open theatre show.feeding the parrots was also very interesting.we even took photos with flamingos.
The tram ride is very helpful.
Very few food options are available but u can take your own.
In most of the attractions in Singapore we were not allowed to take pics(very special ones)as they have their own photographers and one pic will cost u around 20-30 SGD which is really heartbreaking.
Other than that it was overall a nice experience.
If you have kids u shouldn't miss this or else u can if you are there to have fun in Singapore."
,,Beautiful Bird Park,4.0,,"The Jurong bird park is very well maintained and suitable for a half day activity. The bird shows are amazing and entertaining. We missed the 10am birds of prey show but managed to watch the high flyer show at 11am, it was very entertaining and interesting where birds were trained to do tricks. There is a tram ride available to get around although only one ride is allowed for free, so I would recommend first getting on to the tram as soon as you enter and go along its route.The array of different birds is phenomenal and the bird show tops it all off.

The S$ 25 for the photos with the birds I thought was a bit too steep. The location is a little far though transportation is not an issue, we took a cab from the center of town which cost us S$ 24. All in all a good day spent & my son enjoyed the experience."
,,Nice to visit on weekdays,4.0,,"I recently went over here by car with a 8,5 month old and a 2,5 year old, so quite a challenge, but since it was a weekday it was relatively quiet in the park. I thought it would be kind of boring for my toddler, since birds are less appealing to that age group. However the way the park is organized and all the activities that are set up it suitable also for toddlers. Loved the bird feeding. Less conveniet with a stroller though this park. Water play park was more than excellent!!"
,,Great park,5.0,,"Buy your ticket on line and skip the queue at the entrance. There is a little train to the right of the entrance that costs SD5 extra but well worth the price. It takes you around the park and gives you an idea of which parts you'd like to visit again once the tour is over. Everything is very tidy and well kept, and they have an educational message about our environment to my liking.
There is a nice bird show a couple of times a day at the amphitheatre close to the entrance."
,,Interesting Family Adventure,5.0,,The bird park is all what you expect it to be. You will learn a lot and enjoy the day with the birds and wonderful flowers . This is surely a family fun day event. Kids will learn a lot. Price is reasonable for a day tour.
,,Day visit,5.0,,"Best to see birds in very large aviaries , many free flying including bird shows at certain times of the day. Easiest way to see many varied birds in one place. Birds are kept in spacious wonderful surroundings keeping them happy!"
,,Great Bird Park,5.0,,"Amazing exhibit of amazing birds, the flight show is special. $20 taxi ride from the city, $25 admission"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Amazing animal park, enclosures are really large and clean. Huge variety of birds. Live shows are entertaining and engaging. Loved the wetlands area, even had free ranging iguanas. Easy to get to using public transport. Variety of food to buy with good range of prices."
,,Very fun place for both kids and aldults,5.0,,There are not only birds but other animals and beautiful gardens too! Bring hats or umbrella as it's hot out side; you may need water and comfy shoes as well...log walk around the park
,,Must see attraction,4.0,,Get down at Boon Lay (EW27) MRT and hop on to Bus No. 194 From Boon Lay bus interchange to get to this place. A recommended attraction of Singapore. One can see lot of different birds and don't miss the shows. Suggest to take the tram ride first to get a sense of the entire park first and then head straight to section of your interest first. Please note down all the show timing at the entrance itself and plan. One needs to be ready to walk and explore this place.
,,Must visit place in Singapore,4.0,,"One of the prime attrition for Singapore visitors, for those who might visited KUL bird park you might find this being smaller size, however this had a reasonable space to attract. since most of the places in Singapore seems like a rain forest this attraction had its own views and space for nature. you should buy this ticket with other attractions to save on expense. This is out of city, hence ensure you allow a half day during your visit."
,,A nice place to spend time on.,4.0,,The park is near Jurong Point shopping mall so i should recommend to take the morning in the park and go to Jurong Point and have your lunch there.
,,wonderful place to visit with kids,5.0,,"good place to visit when you are with kids. They loveeeee checking each spots and looking at all kinds of birds.
Be sure to bring a comfort walking or even running shoes, tissues, umbrella, and spare of t-shirt. especially, be sure to bring your camera. lots of pictures to take. you can also feed the birds"
,,Amazing world that you will fall in love with,5.0,,"The bird park and the varities of birds was amazing... i had a wonderful time learning and seeing them... it was a riot of colours, sizes and behaviors...the bird shows were mesmerizing for both adults and kids to enjoy together."
,,Regular visits by our kids!,4.0,,Took the SG50 offer for the annual pass. No doubt this is the older of the all the wildlife attractions of Singapore. There are still hidden gems to be discovered. The barn owl & snow owl in the dark is often missed. The penguins are always enchanting. Love the collection of all the pink colored flying creatures (so many of them!). The research center is great way to see little baby birds get fed. Great walk in the late afternoon and early evening. Not to mention the bird shows and water play area for the little tots!
,,bird lovers!!,4.0,,"this place is for bird lovers! lots of variety of birds,great visit with kids.well maintained,must visit!!"
,,A day with the birds,4.0,,Government has spend a lot of money on reclaimed land to develop this large bird cage Worth seeing and the birds of prey show is good entertainment
,,Great place to go if you love birds!,5.0,,"Great shows that focus on conservation efforts, informative sharing and feeding sessions, friendly and helpful staff. Wonderful place to go if you love birds and want to learn more about them. Dont miss the King of the Skies show and the High Flyers show. Really engaging, fun and educational shows!"
,,Singapore Odyssey,5.0,,First Rate.If I had only 2 days in Singapore this would definitely be part of the top 5 Attractions.Very large open netting suggests the birds are free.The best bird attraction I have attended.No cramped cages here.
,,Funny place,4.0,,"When visiting SIN and you are a nature lover, besides Zoo, Orchid Garden and Bird Park you have to go. Is not a place for kids only."
,,Make sure you go for the Penguin feeding,4.0,,"For a bird park, Jurong Bird Park is pretty good. A little far out, but nothing is really too far in Singapore. We arrived in time for the Penguin feeding, and were able to feed the penguins some fish ourselves. It was a great experience."
,,Nice experience with parrots,5.0,,"It is quite a journey to the west of Singapore judging by the fact that we stay at north east part. It took us 45mins by driving with jam along CTE. We missed the 10am show but managed to watch the high flyer show at 11am, it was very entertaining and interesting where birds were trained to do some tricks. I guess the other show would be the same as well. You don;t want to miss these 2 shows. The park was quite small comparing to the zoo, so pls don;t waste your $ taking the tram ride, you can walk around the whole park without feeling tired at all. Do watch out for the feeding time for various birds, it was fun to watch as well. The highlight will be the Lory Loft experience, you can have the birds standing on your fingers or even shoulder. You can feed them and they seems like very friendly and do not scare of humans. This will be the must visit areas of the park. Do bring some insects repellent for your visit. Overall it was very fun and worth the visit."
,,Great bird park,5.0,,"Jurong bird park was great fun. The shows were excellent and educational. It is a distance to get too as its not near the city, although well worth the travel."
,,Seems they are shifting!,2.0,,"Most of the exhibits were closed or in run down condition. Access to the park itself was very difficult with no signages. The SBS bus driver who drove our bus could not speak a word of english or may be he did not talk to people. Shows were excellent tho. some dead birds were not removed and children were shocked to see them. Feeding the lorries was exciting. But my point is if you are shifting say so, donot take our money."
,,Hilarious bird show,5.0,,The highlight of our visit to the park was the bird show. It was really done well - entertaining and funny. They have the Macau talking at the end of the show and it is just priceless to listen to. Go just for this show - it was great.

,,World of Birds,4.0,,This birdpark is very well maintained and suitable for a half day activity. their shows are amazing and entertaining. There are free shuttlebus to MRT stations and even easily accessible through public transport.
,,FANTATIC does not begin to describe it. And easy to reach via public transportation.,5.0,,"We had visited maybe 15+ years ago and again last week- it's more incredible than ever. The grounds are Gorgeous, and our feathered friends really shine here- stunning photo opportunities. We chose to ride the tram (its $5 Singapore/ (about $3,70U.S.) and a great overview to see the sheer vastness of this place and to give you an idea of how to pace your stay and proximity to the 2 shows- both of which are not to be missed. They had not had the waterpark for kids before so unfortunately we did not have swimwear for our grandson with us but its a huge area and looked amazing (included). Our 6 yr old was dying to go again while we were in Singapore, he loved feeding the lories and every bit of his time here.
Very easy to do on your own, its about 30 min out of town- its a huge area, and easy to take the East West MRT (green line) to the Boon Lay station (EW27). I believe you can actually exit into the bus interchange but we did not spot the sign and came out at street level right on the corner. The Bus #194 is right across the street in the back of the mall. Just go IN the mall (not around it)- tons of buses depart from here and there are permanent lines for each- and signs to let you know when the next one is departing. Since the bus originated here we only waited maybe 6 min and everyone got a seat.
When we went the 1st time the bus stopped right in the parking lot so we were not watching as diligently as we should have, it stops on the street now about a half block before the entrance. Fortunately the Singaporean people are beyond kind and we obviously looked like tourists- camera and go pro were probably a good hint :0). They asked if we were headed for Jurong and the driver paused long enough for us to bolt off, but it was maybe 15 min bus ride. For the return, this was a one way street, if you walk through the covered arch to the street heading in the other direction- you will see the bus stop for the return- could not have been easier. We had the day to spend as much time as we wanted. Definitely one of our favorite things to do in Singapore- we were a family from age 6 to 77. Try to go on a day when rain is not a major factor, the birds don't fly when it rains :0)"
,,Amazing world of Birds,5.0,,This is certainly am amazing experience and more so the show of birds is outstanding. The masters have done a wonderful job in training birds and show case bird brain and talent.
,,Flyer paradise,5.0,,"Initially, i was in dilemma to visit or not , but it is very good and nice experience specially the show hi flyer at auditorium at 3 pm was really good. waterfall view again nice"
,,Worth a visit when in Singapore.,4.0,,"Good bird park with many to see.
Does take a lot of walking to get around but there is a tram to help you get around.
The bird shows are really good and a must see.
Feeding lorikeets is the best fun and funny when they try to nip you.
The park is not really near any other attractions so you need a taxi."
,,Good birds show,4.0,,Bird show they host is very good. Never realised what birds can be trained to do. Wide range of birds are present here.
,,Slightly boring,2.0,,My children found this park a little boring. There are things to do but I would always prefer Singapore Zoo if you had to make a choice.
,,Seems like we were in India.....,3.0,,Surrounded by Indian nationals on that day...Really feel like we were in India.... couldn't even find an ATM that I could use as the only ones available there is from the State Bank of India.
,,Interactive,5.0,,Such a wide variety of birds. A lot of them are able to be seen up close and personal and there are some interactive areas. Glad to see that they are doing more upgrades too. A lovely day out.
,,Kids and adults loved it,5.0,,"We have birds at home so liked this more than others. On tour trip to get there and good,access in. Caught the tram ride to stop 2 then went inside the massive bird enclosure with Aussie birds, get some bird food and feed the birds , parrots. Great fun and photos. Then get out and walk the rest. Plenty of birds and waterfall enclosure was great too. Man made waterfall then plenty of bird. This attraction was a good surprise."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,This bird park was fantastic. Anyone going should definitely watch the amphitheatre because the show is amazing and the birds themselves are the main stars!
,,Must Visit Place!!,5.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is really well maintained, with a high quality of cleanliness and hygiene. They have such a wonderful and exquisite collection of birds of different species, sizes, colours, etc. You have the liberty of even feeding the birds of your own hands, a feeling which an individual will always treasure!! Travelled in the year 2010 (not available in the dropdown)."
,,best location for child enjoy,5.0,,giving good knowledge to child for see different types of bird and good location for morning time spent. child really enjoy this place.
,,Better things to visit in Singapore,3.0,,"My children were looking forward to seeing the park but even they were left a little deflated. There are some very good exhibits like the waterfall aviary and the pelican grove but the lory loft and penguin coast were a let down. The Penguins reminiscent of a scene in Happy Feet stuck behind a glass window was rather boring and the lory loft was saturated by far too many people. Like most attractions in the world, visit this place during the week to get the best experience.
The aviary waterfall was amazing and peaceful, also the birds inside were very colourful. There is another exhibit called Jungle Jewels, that is worth visiting too and much more to look at than the lory flora and fauna was exemplary too, lots of lovely trees and flowers to look at and take pictures of.
Overall the place is clean and tidy but the exhibits could, or should, be more spacious for bigger birds. Staff are very friendly, like most of Singapore, and could find smiles out of the grumpiest people. Didn't have any food as brought own in and plenty of water fountains to fill up from."
,,Beware African Grey parrot,3.0,,"Went here with my friend as we both like bird watching. All was going really well, seeing native birds getting some easy food, until we went into the large aviary. Yes it is big, yes it has an amazing waterfall but it also had a parrot. There was an African Grey parrot which decide to get over friendly with my friend. Kept trying to land on her and if you have ever got close to a parrot you will know that their beaks are very strong. Nothing we did would deter the beast so we had to leave.

I sent the park an email but have heard nothing. Just wonder what would have happened if that had been a child on the receiving end??

The rest of the park was lovely but that incident had left a bad taste."
,,"Nice and clean, feathery friends!",3.0,,"It was a hot sunny weekend when I visit the park. It is advise to visit early when the park first open as to avoid the hot sun.

You could take the tram ride around the park, o4 like what we did stop at station 1 and explore the birds around that station. The one I enjoy was the canopy area where the birds roam freely within. You have an option to buy some food and feed the birds at sg3 each cup.

The park size is walkable I did walk the rest of the way around the park from there on. Enjoyed the parrot, Eagles n vultures. Flamingo are pretty too.
Don't forget to get some chilling air on at the penguin station. Over all, It was fun n relaxing."
,,Bird lovers Paradise,5.0,,A wonderful place for viewing loads of colorful birds and hear about then and experience them in nature ..
,,True Story: Macaws Do Lick Salt ... From Your Finger Off Your Brow When You're Not Used To The Humidity & Sweat,4.0,,"Visited 12APR14 What a huge amount of variation in the exhibits, not only birds on display but the way they're displayed. What wonderful shows to pause for a while and enjoy. What a wonderful young childrens water playground to cool off in (Note to others: Take bathing suit for children if you wish). What a wonderful opportunity to learn about SO many species we share this earth with. With sincere thanks Jurong Bird Park we thank you for a wonderful day."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Beautiful park with a vast number of bird species. Must visit for any nature lover. There are some open enclosures where you can come n direct contact with birds which was an amazing experience. To see the whole park would take you at least three hours i.e. without catching the shows.

Find out the show timings beforehand and plan your schedule appropriately, don't miss out on the ""Lory Loft"" where you can hand feed the birds. I recommend the tram cause walking the whole thing would be very tiring."
,,A lovely bird park with a lots of variety,4.0,,Interesting day trip to see a wide variety of birds in a well laid out setting. They have a interesting walk through aviary plus the usual bird shows.
,,Perfect for kids,5.0,,"My 2 years old son enjoy this place so much that we need to go, at least, once a month! A wonderful place, much bigger than you would expect!"
,,Good place to see different birds and get to know more about them.,4.0,,"Do check for the show timings and ensure not to miss any of them, this place is not a choice on a rainy day as the shows get cancelled due to rain.
It can easily take 5 - 6 hours so be prepared, plan accordingly and go slow enjoying the place.

Don't miss the one to feed birds, it is a real good experience."
,,Good,4.0,,Good place to visit. Lots and lots of birds and shows r also good. But it takes at least 5-6 hrs to see the same. Don't miss the waterfall
,,Beautifully Birds,5.0,,The layout and the design of the whole facility is excellent. Its very child friendly and enough things for toddlers and above to do. Very informative and focus on conservation is something I liked. Try to eat with the Parrots. Its fun and different.
,,Family vacation @ Singapore,5.0,,"Excellent and well maintained bird park. Visited again after 13 years....great improvement. Bird species from all parts of the world. Wheelchair available for all ages (for free). Do not miss the amphitheatre show at 3pm, well executed show by Sheena and the birds. Value for the money. If you are a vegetarian pack some food very few options for veg. First do the tram ride to get an overview then go by walk for your preferred exhibit"
,,Not for you if you aren't a true birds lover,3.0,,I went there because of my wife and kid. I am not really a bird's lover but was really amazed to see some of the birds inhabitant there. One of the best things were many of the shows which happens there. They all are amazing shows. One should really watch all the shows. I found these shows better than visiting birds at their cages.
,,Interesting and good for kids,5.0,,"Many people choose to skip this attraction.But i advise that it should not be missed as you will rarely get to see penguins which is one of the main attractions here.
There are lots of birds and of different species.
The moment you enter the park you will greeted by the pleasant chirping of the birds.
There is a tram service which can take you around the park.
You can also feed the birds.
You click pictures with the birds.
There is also a bird show at specific timings
Very good experience for the entire family"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Special attractions in the Park: Helix Bird Show is simply awesome. Should not be missed. They will conduct two shows per day. Waterfall Aviary is also very good
Jurong Bird Park is located in a remote place in Singapore. Not easily accessible by Public transport. Better to take a taxi."
,,Entertaining for adults and kid,5.0,,Brought my little boy (2 year old) and he was totally enthralled by the Wings of Life show. They have two shows - 11 am and 3 pm. It was raining but the amphitheater was sufficiently covered and no one got wet. Do make a trip down to the bird park!
,,Very engaging,5.0,,"One of the prime attractions in Singapore, do not miss this. Their collection of birds and well maintained aviaries make it worth your time and money. One can feed the birds too.
I suggest you collect their map and schedule at the entrance and plan your route accordingly. That way you can attend all the shows too. We managed to cover all. One can take a pram inside."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Please visit especially if travelling with kids. They have good strategies for interaction with the feathered friends. Tram ride is available to get around although only one ride is allowed for free, so I would recommend first getting on to the tram as soon as you enter and go along its route. The shows are also very good with nice audience interaction."
,,Winged delights!,4.0,,"It is great fun to see all the birds in here.. However I must share that in some places it was sad to see the birds caged up like that! Some birds were left in the open and were flying around and would come back. that was pretty decent.
The S$ 25 for the photos with the birds I thought was a bit too steep and not worth it!"
,,One of the largest bird park in Asia,5.0,,"Jurong bird park is location where you can see almost all the varieties of birds across globe.
Bird park has huge area and Mandai river nearby will add value to this attraction.
Must visit if you are family, good for kids and many other.
You will get all facilities such as food, ample toilets, rest area and many more.
There is also bird feeding and lunch with birds show. For details please visit bird park website."
,,Birds beautiful birds,5.0,,I went here with family and friends and we had the best time. The array of different birds is phenomenal and the bird show tops it all off. I would highly recommend this attraction to young and old alike there is something for everyone to enjoy here.
,,Wonderfully made,5.0,,This a must see whilst in Singapore. The variety of birds are great and the walk thru bird aviarys are well done. There is a fabulous water park for young children to swim and play at also.
,,Birds from everywhere,5.0,,You will see birds from all over the world. There are so many. It is a long walk so take the cars they offer.
,,Much better than expected!,5.0,,Impressive! Species you can't see elsewhere! There are birds that look prehistoric like they belong in jurassic time frame. Highly recommend a visit to this unique park.
,,"nice to meet parrots, and nice place to climb..",4.0,,"if you like climbing, I really recommend!! If you aren't afraid of birds, you can go, It's so coooooool! however, you should really take care of mosquito bites!"
,,Wonderful morning at the bird park,5.0,,"The bird park is smallish to walk through but full of incredible birds. The variety is incredible and you can get so close to some of the birds. The staff all seem happy there and it has a great atmosphere. The birds enclosures are really decent and very clean and lush. The bird park has great shows and experiences- like feeding nectar to lorikeets and having them climb on your hand and watching hawks being fed and learning about them up close. The highlight was the bird show with the show being so entertaining and being so close to such beautiful animals. The highlight for my children was the playground and waterpark. the playground is full of great activities and the waterpark is good to wander in, during the heat of the day. Singapore should be really proud of the birdpark - its lovely."
,,Great place take a camera,5.0,,Best place ever for bird lover need a really good camera and take your time bird from all over the world very impressed
,,For bird lovers,4.0,,It was good. We were started with an eagle show. Then we moved on our own to explore that place. Many types of birds were there. Many of them which I saw for the first time. It was too humid that day. And i returned from there after one and half hour..
,,LORY LOFT!!!,5.0,,"we loved the park, our kids went berserk feeding the lorry birds at te lorry loft. This was simply the start attraction for us. We also enjoyed the tram ride, various exhibits and the high flyer show but regretted our short visit as we would have loved to spend more time at the Lory Loft."
,,LORY LOFT ROCKS!,4.0,,"While we thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Jurong bird park (extremely well maintained,large and varied exhibits, loved the high flyers show!) the clear STAR for our kids was the Lory loft where you can feed the lovely little lorry birds right out of the palm of your hand. Our kids went crazy attracting the the birds to sit on their hands/heads. We could have spent hours here alone but sadly did not get enough time due to a short visst. Till next time!"
,,Enjoyable Day at the Bird Park,5.0,,"Visited with bird park with young children on a recent trip to Singapore. Took a taxi ride from Little India which cost 20 SGD - 25 mins. The attraction is reasonable priced at 29 SGD for adults and 19 SGD for children.

Recommend getting there early to avoid the unbearable heat off the afternoon. Must dos:--

1. Lorry Loft - The MAIN attraction - Simply loved feeding the Lorry's honey in the Lorry Loft. Very well constructed and a massive collection of Lorikeets. Great opportunities to take photos - they are so colourful and pretty!

2. Waterfall Aviary - Another very well contracted area with a huge waterfall and flying birds which makes it an experience to cherish

3. Parrots Paradise - Great collection of Macaw's (simply love them), different coloured parrots/ Lorikeets. Enjoy!!

4. The two birds show are definitely not to be missed - Enjoyed the High Flyers show more than the King of the Skies Show but both worth watching. How they train these birds is amazing. Get a seat in the middle rows in the High Flyers show and you will get a chance to participate in the fun….

Drink plenty of water/ cold drinks to keep hydrated during the day. The Bird park itself will take around 4-5 hours.

Improvements however need to be made to the provision of taxis from the bird park at the end of the day. Had to wait 40 mins for a taxi as taxi drivers don't like coming to this part..Eventually this site will be closed and the Bird Park will be moved closer to the Zoo but until then the park authorities need to sort this issue out"
,,It is a must,5.0,,"Every time I visit Singapore , I have to give this place a visit , I love the Lorry Loft and the Waterfall Avery , also the hilly nature of the park make it a challenging walk especially if you are pushing a stroller !
I also love the Birds of Paradise and the Victoria Crowned Pigeons , also the new Parrots Paradise is really nice though it is a racket trying to walk through it ."
,,Beautiful birds,4.0,,We loved our visit. Took about 20mins to get there from our hotel on orchid. There is a lot of walking to get around but can hop on the train. The bird show was brilliant. Huge variety of birds an they look to be happy an well maintained in their enclosures. Had our photo taken with birds :) plenty of food choices and a beautiful gift shop. All round nice visit
,,Birds n birds !!,4.0,,"Birds viewed and felt from the close range.. You can feed the birds, play with them and enjoy the company.. Amazing and must for children, they are gonna love it !!"
,,Not a nice place,1.0,,Don't good there it's no worth it waste of time the place is not organized and there no birds to touch or to take a photo only few
,,Good experience,4.0,,"You need a day in the bird park. It can be accessed easily. Take East west MRT(green line) and get down at Boon Lay station. When you exit, you can see a complex on your right side. Go to the complex and take right. The bus number 194, take you to bird park.
There is a tram which has 2 stops. So you can get down at each stop and walk nearby attractions. You need to walk a lot here. There are 2-3 restaurants inside. It is good to keep some snacks and food with you and of course water too. The shows are really good and dont miss it. That makes the trip worth. You can take the same route to come back. Come to the main road where you got down. Cross the over bridge to reach the other side of the road, you will see the bus stop. Catch 194 which will drop you at the MRT,"
,,Lots of walking.,3.0,,"Hmm this place is a little overrated, I love love love birds and was looking forward to visiting the bird park all week however felt it was a bit disappointing. Maybe I hyped it up too much, but it all seemed too large and empty. We fed the lorikeets in the enclosure but left rather early after 2-3hrs even though I thought we would spend the whole day there. Be prepared to do lots of walking."
,,One of the best bird parks,5.0,,"When there is a bird park in the vicinity, I just must go visit it. And this is the best bird park I've visited so far!
The selection of birds is splendorous.

Only minor I could find is that they ought to update more of the cages with glass facades so you have a more unobstructed view of the birds."
,,quite interesting,4.0,,It is good park for family if you are animal lovers. There are several shows which you shouldn't miss.
,,beautiful birds park ever,5.0,,very nice place for both kids and adults. variety of birds. nicely presented. enjoy and spent your time in Lorry Loft. Kids loved to feed colorful parrots.
,,Water play area too,4.0,,There's a water play area here similar to the Singapore Zoo but I think slightly bigger. The pelican feeding is a must
,,Nice shows,4.0,,"We love the birds show time, cannot be missed. It have audience with interactions with birds. Only weather is hot n humid in spore"
,,Take the kids.,5.0,,"Great entertainment. The kids will love it. Feed the birds out of your hand. I have the best photo of two little chinese girls feeding the birds, the look on their faces is priceless."
,,nice place for bird lovers,4.0,,"covered in 1.5-3 hours, a must visit place for bird lovers. the kids will love the shows the park offers. do carry water/juices with you for a sunny day. we loved the bird show and the parrot paradise."
,,Birdies,3.0,,The location is quite distance from the city and can be reached by taxi. The bird park is not massive but they have a selection of bird that taken a good care. I like the waterfall the most. The walk can be done in a short time. Another interesting species live here is the penguins. They look healthy and taken a good care not like in the other bird park where the bird was look pitiful.
,,👍,5.0,,"This park is an excellent place to spend 3-5 hours. Huge territory, populated with hundreds types of birds, will make your journey across the birds world unforgettable."
,,Beautiful Colours,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is so full of beautiful Birds of every colour you really dont know where to look first. Well laid out and so much to see.
Take the Tram ride and get on and off to see all the exhibits - Look out for the Toucan's their snap happy.
Great day out, kids will love it."
,,One of the best places to visit and see amazing birds and bird shows,5.0,,Good for bird lovers.. the parrots literally come and sit on our hands and heads if you buy a food packet for them.. The bird shows are worth watching... Is a must visit place if you plan a trip to Singapore
,,Children's paradise.,4.0,,"Jurong birdpark hasn't changed a bit in the last 20 years. I went there as a child, and now visited as a parent. Its an awesome day trip with kids, We could watch the shows and take the tram to go around the Park. Walking into the tropical forest and being able to feed the birds was a refreshing treat to all senses."
,,Naturally beautiful,5.0,,"If you are a nature-lover, you really should come here. Jurong bird park is very clean and beautiful, has so many birds from all around the world."
,,"Good, but not quite what was expected",4.0,,"To be honest, this attraction didn't lived up to its mark. Maybe because we had too little time to really 'explore' it. The tram ride went too fast to actually able to see the birds.
The best thing about it was the Bird Show; really enjoyed seeing huge cockatoos and macaws flying overhead."
,,Unique park for Birds,4.0,,"Beautifully set-upped park for birds, here you can find almost all the species in world... They have a large collection of orange flamingos which was a treat to our eyes......."
,,Nice but HOT,4.0,,Spent half a day here but in the end the heat got to us! Lots of amazing birds to see. We caught the little train around the park as it is fairly large so take comfy shoes.
,,Not as good as it used to be but still worth a visit,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is unique as there are not that many parks dedicated to birds. Like Singapore itself, this park is being renovated constantly. Sometimes for the better, sometimes not so. Besides the variety of species, it also offers some fun performances by the bird whispers and their ""students"". I missed the days when some of the very charismatic hosts were presenting the shows. Now, the chemistry between the hosts and audience is not as obvious ..."
,,"Loved the owls, bird shows and waterplay area!",4.0,,"We went to Jurong Bird Park as part of the four-park hopper pass so was very good value for entry price.

We absolutely loved the owl display-there were many different types of owls to see, including three majestic Snowy Owls so that was pretty special. The two birds shows were also very good and showcased a range of small, large and fascinating birds.

Definitely pay extra for the train ride as it goes around most of the park and is very scenic. We also had a great time at the Birdz of Play area with our 2yo son-such a welcome break from the heat!

If you love birds, you will find every type of bird imaginable here and it's a lovely setting. For us, half a day was enough to see the shows, our favourite birds and play at the waterplay area.

Jurong Bird Park is a fair way out of town so we made a day out of it by stopping at the Snow City/Sciencentre precinct on the way back (via taxi)."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"We loved the Singapore Zoo and the River Safari, so we had high expectations for the Jurong Bird Park (JBP). It did not disappoint. We took the MTR, with no problem at all. In fact we stopped at a small shop in the Boon Lay station and purchased 3 chicken rice meals to bring with us - they were awesome. The bus ride was easy.
We ended up taking family pictures as soon as we entered the park. If you do this be sure to ask for different photos (Ex family, parents only, kids only, etc) and ask for the digital copy of the pictures. The park itself was easy to navigate. We missed the first bird show so we hopped on the tram. As we went around the park the driver stopped and told everyone to get off. We were confused, but then he explained that we missed the bird show so we should go into the Lorry Loft while it was not crowded. That was the best advice we could have gotten. We ended up buying 4 cups of the bird food and taking lots of fabulous pictures with the birds. They were all over kids.
We walked around the rest of the park. It was really interesting to read and learn about the birds.
Lots of clean bathrooms spaced around the park. Waterfall Station was outrageously beautiful. Funny-we saw another family eating the same chicken rice packets here!
They have a water play area for kids. They also have an air conditioned room here if you need to get out of the heat.
Expect to spend 6+ hours.
MTR was easy. It takes 45min - 1 hour, but for the price and to watch the scenery, I highly recommend it. Bonus- chicken rice in the station and they have a mall with an amazing food court. We ended up eating there when we left the JBP."
,,Superb trip.,5.0,,Good for a day. U can actually walk with the birds all around u A tram ride gives u an overview of the park and then u can cover individual areas which u like during the tram ride Variety of colourful parrots and other bird species. Please make a note of their bird shows which has particular timings Indian food was out of stock at their restaurant just outside the enterance to the bird park We got Coke at the souvenir cup at the bongo burger joint at 50 percent less Good deal. A must visit. Much less crowded than zoo
,,2nd Trip to The Zoo,4.0,,My experience here was very enjoyable. The staff was very friendly and it was nice to have a tram ride. The show we saw was spectacular and I can't describe how awesome it was. The most fun place was the Lori Cage. You can buy food to feed the bird and they will almost certainly fly to you.
,,--talk with nature-without speaking!!,5.0,,Pls do not miss it!-i know its tuff to getup early morning-whn you are on holiday!!-but then -it will only do good to your eyes-then to mind-and your heart will be happy!-jus by being there-joy is the word--and you will enjoy!!
,,Best Bird Park,5.0,,This would be one of the best bird parks I have been to. Well worth taking time out to observe the bird life in natural habitat.
,,Great Photo Ops!,4.0,,There are many gorgeous birds here who seem to be happy in their lovely bird park. There are bird presentations and opportunities to take your own photos with these exquisite creatures sitting on your arm.
,,Nice Bird Park,4.0,,"Amazed at the many different species of birds found here, definitely an eye opener. Visit before this park moves!"
,,"Wonderful aviaries, no crowds",4.0,,This was easily reachable by taxi for about $S20 (there is a bus - see the website for the Park). We spent the morning here on a weekday and there were no crowds. Particularly enjoyed the open walk-through areas where you could get up close to the birds. Great photo opportunities. Would have liked more explanations about the birds and where they are found - signage was a bit scarce in certain parts of the park.
,,Great place to spend a half day,5.0,,"We had a great visit to the Jurong Bird Park -- after visiting the Zoo, Night Safari, and the River Safari, it was hard to be impressed, but yet, we still really liked our time at the Bird Park. Loved the large aviaries where birds are flying freely over your head. Saw a few shows which were great, if only to see the birds in full flight. It's a well-organized place, like its sister parks, and easy to navigate. Also like the other parks, the food options inside the park are expensive and probably mediocre in quality, so if you can plan for it, bring lunch (we bought sushi and bento boxes from the ""Japanese Street"" area of the mall (B1 level) where you make the change from the MRT at Boon Lay station to the bus (bus 194)). Taking public transport there could not be easier - at Boon Lay, you follow signs for the bus interchange, which is right through the mall, and then the bus lines are clearly marked.
There is also a water play area for children which is really nice - has a large play structure with slides, spouts, tipping buckets of water, etc. Great way to relax after a long, hot day. Bring bathing suits for this. It's included in the ticket.
We happened to accidentally leave one of our cameras at the park, and miraculously, it showed up at the member services area. We called ahead of time, found out it was there, and picked it up, overjoyed to have retrieved the photos we had taken. Spoke volumes about the excellent service and organization of the place.

Tips:
1. Bring bottled water and refill near the bathrooms. Having actual water refilling stations would be good, and would be in keeping of the Reduce, Reuse, Recycle theme. Plus, water is $2 a bottle there.
2. Bring lunch and some snacks
3. Take public transport, which is easy and comfortable
4. Bring bathing suits if the kids want to participate in the water play area"
,,Colorful and Chirpy,5.0,,Very well maintained park. Must do when travelling with kids. The souvenirs are expensive though.The birds are beautiful.
,,Very beautiful park,4.0,,Juror get bird park is very well laid out and beautiful. We are not major bird lovers but enjoyed our selves. The tram is great to get a good look around and to get off and explore in more detail
,,"Almost like a full blown zoo, hghly recommended!",5.0,,"The bird park is worth a lengthy trip by public transportation. Steer clear of travel agencies that offer a 3.5 hrs visit, plan instead a whole day to enjoy the beautiful birds and reptiles."
,,Wonderful way to spend the day with Family and friends,5.0,,This is a magnificent park. so beautiful and the birds are amazing to see. So well done and lots of pretty flowers and greenery everywhere. Very paradisaical. Loved it
,,Great place for families,5.0,,"This was our second visit and there have been a lot of improvements since last time. The kids wet playground looked great! The bird shows are well done - make sure you get to them during your visit. It is easy to get there by public transport, but allow about an hour's travel time from the city centre."
,,Asia's largest bird park is absolutely delightful! :),5.0,,"Out of Singapore Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park, Asia's largest bird park is definitely my favourite out of the four wildlife attractions in Singapore! The open plan nature of the attraction is absolutely delightful for enjoying the natural behaviour of the birds at their very best and fantastic for educating kids (and adults!) about the ecosystem. The birds here are very well taken care of and all of the birds I saw looked very healthy and happy :).

I had a thoroughly good time at all of the bird shows especially the ""High Flyers Show"" where I volunteered myself to hold onto two toucans on each arm while they performed some acrobatics. ""Lunch With Parrots"" (it costs about 25SGD for the buffet lunch and to see the show) was also very fun where I got to dine al fresco and watch parrots do some abstract painting haha.

You will need at least 3 hours in Jurong Bird Park to be able to see all the shows and exhibits without rushing. Bring a bottle of water with you as it can get very hot walking around the park and some mosquito spray to ward off the mozzies. I definitely recommend a visit to Jurong Bird Park when you are in Singapore! :)"
,,Vibrant and fascinating!,5.0,,"We had a very fun time visiting the JBP. It was not very crowded, as we visited during the morning of a weekday. The staff were mostly friendly and helpful, and the birds really made up for those who were not. The lory feeding station was very fun, but with the rate at which people feed them, they may not want to eat from your portion.
The tram ticket is worth getting, as the stations has already all been planned out carefully.
Also, I highly recommend that you check the showtimes before visiting, as they are really thrilling!"
,,Must visit✅,5.0,,We've been here back in 2013 and loved visiting this huge park with family and really enjoyed here. Undoubtedly one of must visit parks in Singapore💚
,,Huge bird park... Must visit,4.0,,"Flamingos,swans,penguins ... You name the bird , they are there. Better to take the tram , which has convenient stops. There is huge and beautiful water falls and an aviary around. This 100 ft falls is supposed to be the tallest man made in the world."
,,Dated and not improving,3.0,,"Rumor has it that the Jurong Bird Park is slated for moving closer to the Zoo area in the next few years. Because of this, there has been no new exhibitions for some years and the park is looking very dated now. Still an interesting place to visit and worth it if you get a 4 park ticket for the Zoo/Night Safari. Still, traveling out to Jurong can be difficult for those who do not know their way around Singapore and hopefully in the coming years the Bird Park will shine again."
,,Bird deal trip,5.0,,Very clean and friendly staff. The performance is great. Keep it up. The birds is having a good accommodation and food! The penguins are cute!!
,,Rain day out,3.0,,Was a pleasant day out. Not as much here as I thought there would be but over all it was nice. It was great to see but once I have seen it I don't think I would hurry back.
,,Check Promos on Website,4.0,,"Pros:
1. It is easy to get here via public transport. Exit Boon Lay MRT Station, then enter Boon Lay Bus Interchange and take bus 194 for 1 stop to alight at Jurong Bird Park.
2. There are sufficient public amenities like washrooms and F&B outlets. Alternatively, have meals before / after your trip at Jurong Point Mall located at Boon Lay MRT.
3. The Lory Loft and Waterfall Aviary are 2 large enclosures which mimic natural environments. They also allow visitors to feed and interact with the birds, providing great fun and photo opportunities.
4. There are some informative areas, such as the Discovery Centre as well as the Breeding and Research Centre.

Cons:
1. Other enclosures did not particularly impress me. Some enclosures were small or had pungent smells.
2. The Birds of Prey show might be disturbing to some visitors (e.g. young children), as there is a fake bloody carcass which the vultures fly to and pretend to feed on.

Tips:
1. Locals can download a voucher from the Jurong Bird Park website to enjoy 51% off the admission. This National Day promotion is valid from 1st to 31st August.
2. The circular path around the park can be completed by foot at a leisurely pace in 3 to 4 hours.
3. Pokemon Go players can find many Pokestops and Pokemons here. That said, do be safe and take time to enjoy your surroundings!"
,,Best bird park experience!,5.0,,"Before I visit Singapore, I was debating between bird park, zoo, night safari and river safari. I chose this place since I have a toddler who loves birds, and there are many zoo but not many bird park. It turns out that this was one of the best place to visit in Singapore. Two shows they offer are the best thing, so you need little planning before you go. Also, lots of feeding opportunity which is great fun for not only little ones but for adults too. The buffet lunch offers OK food, but the show was great. The tram ride is nice and short, so you can do it at the beginning or at the end. Overall highly recommended."
,,great day with the family,5.0,,We visited here with our nieces and nephews and what a day it was! There are many shows here running through the day. We picked some shows and walked around the park in the intermediate times. The shows were very well planned and humorous too. Lot of interaction for the kids. Nice places to eat ( though a bit expensive) and everything was spotless. We travel to singapore a few times a year from USA and make this an annual event.
,,"If you've been to the zoo, give this a miss",2.0,,"If you've been to Singapore zoo, there is no need to come here. The smells are overpowering and and really not what the kids signed uo for when they said they wanted to go to Singapore."
,,"Nice place, poor birds of prey",4.0,,"It broke our hearts to see that the biggest birds in the park got the smallest cage. A humungous condor can barely spread his wings and jump from the ground to the nearest branch. Eagles, voltures... crammed together under a low ceiling. Terrible sight. Tough for the eyes of animal lovers, and quite cruel (!!)
We think this situation needs to be rectified urgently!!

Other for that, the place is nice."
,,Bird on the head!,5.0,,"Visited this attraction with my daughter. The falcon and parrot show, ending with a chance to pose with flamingos was amazing.

One gets a chance to feed birds inside the aviary. Unique experience. We were lucky to have a bird actually sit on my daughter's head!"
,,birds from across the world!,5.0,,"If you are a bird lover, this place is amazing. You get to take pictures with colorful parrots, who sit on your shoulders and the pictures they ale are irresistible. we have some lovely family pics taken by the staff there. All shows are entertaining. Go Early!"
,,Average,3.0,,"If you a bird lover or want to watch different kinds of birds, then this is the place.

As I am not a big bird lover, I just visited for the sake of it and it didn't disappoint me. Lot of shows and also you can have lunch with parrots, but everything is charged."
,,Bird Park,4.0,,"Went to Jurong Bird Park today and it was pleasantly enjoyable Highlights - the two shows , quite interactive and enjoyable (one is high flyers and the is birds of prey )"
,,"For bird lovers, not for tourists who expect entertainment",5.0,,"Jurong bird park houses a variety of birds, from parrots to owls to penguins. It has many sections and areas that depends on the natural habitat of each one. Though some areas are small and old, like the Penguin Coast and the birds of prey cages, I believe that the experts know very well how these should be addressed. My review is based on my observations and enjoyment inside the facility.

My beau and I spent an entire day in the bird park, the most enjoyable moment would be feeding the Lory birds in Lory Loft. The nectar is S$3. I also fed the penguins, with fish. The fish plate can ve acquired by donating S$2 to the Penguin Coast. I enjoyed sight seeing birds and enjoying how marvelous they flap their wings or clean their feathers, the trail can be by foot or by unlimited tram ride for S$5. I also suggest going for the bird shows. Make sure you read the schedules.

The washrooms are clean, sinks and wash areas are available at every area, there are food places outside the park--the staff will allow reentry, they will stamp you. The food served in Bongo Burgers are great and are somehow worth the pricing tho it has theme park price.

For kids, I suggest to let them stay with a guardian at the Birds of Play area. This is a playground. I suggest this better than bringing them to see the birds. Birds are sensitive and do not respond well to noise and rash behavior, toddlers will also not benefit in seeing them. The park is most welcoming to ages 10 and above.

My ratings are as follows:
Scope and variety - 5
Bird areas - 4
Cleanliness of facilities - 4.5
Availability of water, washrooms, food stalls - 5
Photography worthiness - 5
Bird interactions - 5
Bird shows - 5

Ps. Check the temperature and weather in Singapore before you plan your visit. Wear light clothing."
,,"Dont miss the bird show, best part of the bird park",4.0,,"Unfortunately it rained heavily when we visited this time. It stopped after a while just in time for the bird show which was really interesting. We then took a tram ride around the park. A good place to take photos at the entrance with birds, it does come out well and worth the money."
,,excellent,5.0,,a must see for bird enthusiasts or bird watchers and a great place for kids to learn about the bird kingdom
,,"Lovely birds, lots to see",4.0,,"A must do if you have the time in Singapore. Easy to get to on the MRT to Boon Lay station then bus 194. $29 for admission + $5 for the train ride, you can get discounts on-line and from a few travel agents (we got about 10% off buying tickets at the Chinatown Visitor Centre).

Plenty of birds here, mostly Asian, but also from Africa and the Americas. Many tourists don't get to see everything as they just get on the train, but it does not stop at the owl house, or the house with the huge pigeons. We walked around the loop first, took about 4 hours, and then caught the train for a short ride around again. If walking be aware that there are some steep up and down sections. But worth it to see the birds.

Stop at the Lory Loft and hand feed lorikeets, great fun, very interactive. We had lunch at the waterfall cafe in the waterfall aviary. The food was basic - hotdogs or snack food, although there were some nice looking fresh salads. Prices were ok. The shows appeared to be popular - free flight etc. There's a souvenir ship at the exit, plenty there but we were really surprised that they didn't have any books about Singapore birds, they're missing an opportunity."
,,Beautiful birds,5.0,,"There are a lot of beautiful birds. A palace of birds, We can feed the birds. A place you must visit."
,,Average!!!,3.0,,Really disappointed as had read real Gud reviews n was really expecting a lot of interactive sessions as well variety like they had a few years back..Kuala lumpur bird park is far superior..The bird shows are average..You have to pay for everything...The lunch with parrots is a real hoax as they do not bring d parrots anywhere near you n incase you want a picture you have to pay 10$ after paying 25$ for lunch..It should be more clearly defined..Really disappointed!!!
,,Nice place if you enjoy watching variety of birds,3.0,,"It is a nice place where you will find loads of varieties of birds. Really loved watching the orange flemingos..they were just awesome! If you are going with children, let me warn you there is a lot of walking and it is tiring. So kindly plan accordingly."
,,Must try,5.0,,The only experience is I have ever had in the bird part is feeding to parrot. Must try kids will love it and other things is penguins.
,,Belongs on the bottom of the to do list for a tourist,3.0,,"I found this park to be old , tired and quite anachronistic in it's layout and it's birdlife. Bird in cages are no longer appropriate and the park needs a massive revamp."
,,Amazing must see park,5.0,,"We luckily visited on a non rainy day. It was cloudy as well so there was no sun. There's too much walking, sometimes uphill. But there's a shuttle available. It's free if you have purchased the 4 park hopper ticket.

Too many birds to see, we arrived late around 3:30 PM so some shows were over.

You get to interact live with the parrots and feed them.

Lots of preying birds and all sorts of owls to see.

We had lunch at bongo burgers which was fine."
,,Lots of surprises,5.0,,This is little bit cozy but worth to go..I saw all the birds that I was dreaming to see in one day. amazing ...lots of walks and man made waterfall.. live bird concerts and many more..you can see birds from all continents..yes there are penguins too
,,Must visit!!,5.0,,Have to visit once in Singapore. There are very nice shows and bird displays. You can also feed birds at park. Full day well spent.
,,Amazing Park...,4.0,,We took the Tram around the park and got down at each station to explore the area around it... Birds show was also nice... After 2pm u can Tram unlimited times...u can cover the park within 2 to 3 hrs.. For those returning by MRT jurong point mall is a good place to hang out thereafter.
,,The best bird park i have seen,5.0,,"i was apprehensive when i started out but the Bird Park turned out to be excellent. The birds were found in very clean and shady surroundings and the shows conducted with the birds turned out to be extremely entertaining, informative and interactive. The efforts taken to maintain the bird park are laudable. A little far from the hotel but with well connected transport systems which is a hallmark of Singapore, the journey was smooth. However, the visit took almost an entire day. Remember to use the transport available at the bird park or it becomes very tedious especially with children and senior citizens. Stay hydrated and dont forget to always carry your umbrellas!"
,,Dont miss the owls,4.0,,"We bought the discounted ticket for this park and the night safari together online and I seriously regretted not doing the two on the same day. Even though the way to the JBP is a bit out of the way, with the MRT and the bus system it's quite cool. A cab driver told me that the JBP is moving closer to the night safari area so it'll be more convenient. If you have kids, they'll love this place but we didn't enjoy it as much as the other animal stuff because we just don't like to see caged animals. One can club other river safari with this as well and spend the whole day with birds and animals. If it's a hot day, I'd recommend the tram or head out wearing caps and with water to avoid dehydration and fatigue. The owls and penguin exhibit is really cool."
,,Beautiful birds,4.0,,"For me it was all about the Macau's. In which they had plenty ! See the show, you may even get the chance to be a part of the show and interact with the birds ! The grounds are clean and the birds seem very well taken care of."
,,Good fun.,4.0,,"We spent an enjoyable afternoon here. The highly entertaining bird show left us frankly open mouthed as we watched parrots hornbills and even Pelicans perform perfectly on command. You can walk through a massive avery of lories and lorikeets which was brilliant fun and also see simply stunning parrots. The only negative is that they do have large birds of prey e.g. Andean condors living in averies which I find rather sad.
This is a big place and is quite a lots of walking especially as the weather is hot, a bus is provided."
,,Picnic spot.,4.0,,"The birds in the park can be seen all over. But the 11 am show of birds talk, listening to trainers orders, queuing in the end by all birds, etc is a treat to watch."
,,A chance to stand very close with Birds.,5.0,,"It was fun there, so bad it was rainy during my visit and the park was so big and i was so tired and i kept looking for my exit gate because i have to rush to airport. Definitely will backk again and take Tram ride."
,,Better than expected,5.0,,"After reading some of the reviews I was not sure wether to visit. I'm so glad we made the visit. Taxi fare from Clark a Quay was $23 and we purchased the Park Hopper for 79 which entitled us to visit the 4 parks, tram rides and boat ride. The shows we're entertaining and the grounds were well laid out. Staff very friendly. It was raining a lot so it made it difficult to see some of the birds. Great area for the children to play in as well."
,,Family Time!,4.0,,"This is one of the attractions we went with my children. They really enjoyed the birds and the view. Even though it was very far from our hotel, we still manage to go and enjoy."
,,Best experience,5.0,,We had best experience with birds uptill now..... All the showz r must attend .... Staff is very friendly helping and good ..... Lory loft is superb ..... All birds r so beautiful .... Must nt miss in singapore if ur goin with kids......
,,Great trip even for young children!,5.0,,"I never thought a bird park would interest my 3-year-old son who barely batted an eye at the River Safari (especially since he was too young for the boat ride), but since he requested it for his birthday... ... But I must say that I was dead wrong. I thought the small birds would be far away and unattractive to a young child, but the enclosures were actually well-planned for ease of viewing. Stand-out attractions like the Lory Loft were of great interest to my kid (and me) too. I loved the interactivity of some of their attractions, e.g. penguin feeding (you can donate S$2 to get a tray of small fish to feed the penguins, and even my rather-cautious kid enjoyed it) and lory feeding (again, you pay to get a bowl of nectar mix) - it really engaged the child and the child-in-me. The bird shows are not to be missed. I would put this way up above the River Safari for a young child. Also, prepare wet gear if you want to let your kids hit the water playground - we didn't because we hit nap-time! (There is also a dry playground!)"
,,A Great Place for Toddlers,5.0,,"This was a good spot for us and our 17 month old. They have frequent bird shows that vary and bird feedings as well. These were fascinating to our daughter. There is also a tram that goes around the park so you don't need to worry about walking with your little one very far between attractions. We paid for the tram ticket ($5 online) but they never asked to see our tickets as a heads up.

Also, for small kids, there is a water park area which is free and open till 5pm or so. You need to bring swimwear though so be forewarned. It looked amazing but we didn't have time to go in since it was close to closing time. Additionally there are eateries on site and basically it's just a relaxing place to spend an afternoon. Well worth checking out if you have little people who are into birds like ours!"
,,An interesting catchup with an old place,3.0,,"I brought my mother and sister here to celebrate my mother's birthday (Singaporeans get free entry on their birthdays). Service crew were pleasant and welcoming, and pretty professional too.

Park space, though small, was well utilised, with many exhibits presented nicely. Do not underestimate the size of the park: there are actually many exhibits to cover amongst the hidden pathways! Over so many years (last I visited was over 10 years ago), much of the flora and fauna have matured, lending a natural touch to the park's atmosphere.

My gripe is that the park is not easily accessible, and that ticket prices are not actually attractive enough to encourage repeated visits, especially for locals. Its a pity that the monorail could not be retained. I could see that the stations have been repurposed though.

Overall, it was a nostalgic visit that allowed me to relive my childhood days. Good for a one off visit, but it will be a while before I return again."
,,Must visit attraction,5.0,,It's a great outing with family or friends or as couple. People of all ages can enjoy equally. Especially kids. They house a wide variety of various species of birds al in their natural habitat. There are various highlights in this place like the bird feeding area wherein u can feed the tiny parrots and other birds yourself. The other major attraction is the bird show! Do not miss it! There is this tram ride also which you take along. The bird hatchery is also quite interesting.
,,Best bird park,5.0,,Amazing! Some much to learn. Perfect way to spent your morning! Bring your camera cause you are going to love every exhibit personally I love the Lory loft the best one by far.
,,Great day out,4.0,,"Visited the bird park with family. Have been before when we used to live in Singapore. Daughter wanted to spend most of the day in the water park area which wasn't here when we visited last but we did go to the Lorry loft so she could feed these beautiful birds and visited the penguin area twice. Other exhibits were good and the park puts on shows which you can watch.

Great day out for families as it doesn't feel as busy as the zoo or other attractions."
,,Visit,4.0,,Went to visit this place and it's nicely set up with tram service so that you don't need to walk all the way to various stations to get hold of the sights of birds and bird shows. Lovely birds!
,,Another Theme Park,3.0,,"I ended up there only because of my sons interest in birds. As far as Zoos go it is well set up with a good collection of Hornbills. I just don't like any animal locked up behind bars, but if you have no opportunity to see them in their habitat, it is a fair substitute."
,,Great family day out,4.0,,"This is a great all around family day out. Although I wondered are some of the enclosures WAY too small for the birds, such as the penguins and the birds of prey. There are lots of things to do for the children, including a splash zone, so take their swim gear/sun screen. Also, the food is terrible, so pack a picnic."
,,Lovely Bird Park,5.0,,"There are so many species of birds here, a huge man-made waterfalls...you can walk alongside the birds...hear the parrots chirp and chirp and get so much knowledge about birds!!"
,,Fabulous morning out.,5.0,,"We had a fantastic morning at the bird park! We enjoyed the lorry lift , where you could buy food for the lorikeets. The lorikeets weren't shy and you would find yourself with about 5 or more birds hanging off your hand trying to get food.
We also enjoy the bird show it is well worth making sure you have time to see it.
We walked around but you can catch a tram around it you prefer.
If you are planning on doing the zoo as well it's worth buy the park hoppers for 2 or more parks."
,,High Flyer show great,4.0,,"Interesting ""shows"" available at various times. Free tram transport around park with 3 stops. Loved the penguins and polar bear enclosures. Also enjoyed the High Flyer show under cover from the rain!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Great time...a must visit place if you are a bird lover and like to spend a quiet and lovely time among birds chirping...so much greenery in the middle of the urban concrete jungle of Singapore
,,surprisingly very good,5.0,,Excellent number of hours for all members of the family - there is even a little tram you can take around. Also good value. extensive amount of bird life around and I would recommend the Falconry exhibition and the parrot show - both well worth attending
,,Good for bird lovers,4.0,,"With a wide variety of birds, the bird park will appeal bird lovers. The park will be renovating soon, and I look forward to a great makeover."
,,Disappointed!,2.0,,"This was my second visit and was travelling with kids, I find there were few birds than the last time, shows was also not that great and it has become very pricey. More commercial. Would rather suggest to skip and go to the zoo instead. Not worth it!"
,,Family oiting,3.0,,"Jurong Bird Park being one of the must go Tourist attraction in Singapore, has been a wonderful attraction all these years.
Went there again with my kids and wife. Honestly speaking, they haven't do a facelift or improvement for many years. I seriously feel they ought to revamp the park, to keep it up to trend. The huge indoor aviary has always my children's favorite spot in the park. That is something you can get up close and personal with birds in there.
Food & beverage in the park not worth the value spend. High priced or over priced food without quality. We had to eat there just for the sake of the children."
,,Who said Birds do not have 6th sense ?,5.0,,"Come to Jurong Bird Park - and you will realise that it is a paradise by itself and birds do have 6th sense and more. Eagle shows, Parrot singing in 3 different languages- chinese, singaporean and english with a birth day song as well ... The penguins living inside the bird park - were at home with antarctic like glass enclosure filled with snow and natural settings @ minus degree temperatures"
,,Look forward to this visit but left feeling disappointed,2.0,,"My wife and I had looked forward to our visit so much, particularly to see the flamingos. However it was very disappointing. The exhibits did not seem well kept and the water seemed quite dirty. In one area there was a dead bird just decomposing in the water. Even some of the birds did not look healthy. The penguin exhibit was the exception and was very good."
,,Visit before its gone (relocate),4.0,,"The park is located in the western part of the country but is very accessible. Alight at Boon Lay (green line) and head towards the bus interchange inside the shopping mall (Jurong Point) which is next to the train station.Take 194 to the park and the bus driver will alert passengers to alight at the bid park stop(most people will alight too). To go back, you can take the same bus from the same bus stop (which will make a short u-turn) or go to the bus stop across the road. The entrance of the park is a short walk from the bus stop (5 min walk). Just walk straight in-front along the direction of the road and you can see the signage.

I spent half a day walking around the park. You can take the tram if you are tired which will stop at the various key stations. do plan your trip well so that you can enjoy the bird show."
,,Lovely place for nature lovers,5.0,,"A stress free , calm place. You can find a huge variety of birds. A vareity of birds from one family. A definite place to visit."
,,kids will enjoy,4.0,,kids will enjoy this place very much ..its really interesting. very clean and good atmosphere ..kids will feel this place like heaven...i am sure every one feel happy by visiting these place ..all the best
,,great collection,5.0,,so many birds and so well maintained...it is amazing and that too so well organized.there are a lot of lessons to be learnt here in terms of putting things together.
,,Great fun for family with Kids,5.0,,"We had an awesome day there. The Lori bird feeding was an awesome experience, and the bird show was good too. The weather being hot was a pain, but the water park for kids is the perfect thing to make the tour complete and memorable. Include the Tram ride, it really helps."
,,Interesting if you are a bird lover.,4.0,,"You get to see birds you haven't known to be existed. Try to catch the bird shows which are more entertaining.
It is a bit far from the central and need to take a day out for it (No other attractions nearby)
Don't take the tram service, just walk the whole place and see as much as you can."
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,We are waling with the Birds. which is really exiting. Safe and enjoyable. We really enjoyed walking through.
,,fun place,4.0,,"the bird park is good, can see a variety of birds, i recommend to come early in the morning as the air still cool down, and please take a ride in the park, bring hat, umbrella incase of rain.

travelling with 2 years old daughther, can watch the bird show in the park which the show itself is nice, food and beverages serves near the entrance. from jurong station you need to take a bus, but i recommend by taxi if you're going with young children. thanks"
,,"If you love birds then this is a place, otherwise it's just OK!",4.0,,"It is really hot so if you have small children remember to bring water and umbrella.
Don't miss the bird show, because we all came here to watch it, the only fun activity to me.
You surely can take picture with bird later on after the show, of course you must pay for those picture too.
However, we don't feel it was fun enough to come back second time, it is far from the central."
,,Good place to see birds,4.0,,"With plans to relocate this park soon, it is really a must to visit really soon. The place is very well maintained. Lots of variety of birds. You need to really walk to see all the different birds in the different enclosures. The tram rides don't really do justice to the park. I love the Lori enclosure and the Parrot enclosure the most. Food and snacks are overrated here. Best to bring your own food. Umbrella and cameras are a must. If you must go for the shows, best to do them on 2 days. One day for the show and the other for the real walk around the park."
,,very nice place to enjoy with the kids,5.0,,"very funny place to look for nice birds, we enjoy with the family and we went there several times. good deals available via their website so don't forget to check. and last but not least bring your camera as if you pay attention you will find a lot of lezards hidden in the herbs or the trees."
,,Pleasant in fine weather.,3.0,,"The bird park is nice but not in wet weather, so make sure you take an umbrella as storms eventuate quickly. The exhibits are lovely and the greenery is so beautiful. Several eating spots within the park are good to take refuge when it rains."
,,Just Fine,3.0,,Bit far from the central. Quite big park and very clean. Have monorail to trip around the park from the above. Birds shows quite ok other than pretty standard nothing too special too.
,,Always good fun,4.0,,Came back here yesterday for another visit (making good use of the annual pass). This time we decided to miss the shows and just walk around the park to see the various exhibits. Continues to be interesting and entertaining for the kids. No doubt we will be back for more.
,,More for kids,4.0,,Very good place to go to if you have kids or unless you really like watching birds of different kinds.
,,Huge park and great bird show,4.0,,"Visited with 1 kid and 1 infant. One of the best place to spend a day in singapore with kids. It was super hot muggy day but felt worth after watching birds show. It ******* show. Must watch.

Park is really huge so be prepare for it. Found few restaurants but little disappointment since expensive and food was average. Ended up eating Sandwitchs and lots of ice creams.

Recommended. Do visit.
Caution: carry couple of drinks with you. Drinks are quite expensive here."
,,Fantastic bird park,5.0,,"Amazing atmosphere, topped with excellent guide made the trip worth all the challenges amidst rain and hectic schedule."
,,Jurong bird park review,2.0,,"Among all places of interest, this would be one of the most boring and it is located on the west end of island.

Not elderly friendly, lots of uphill walk. Even for middle age can be quite tiring. Get a tram instead. The environment itself is not as fascinating. When it's humid. It's even hard to enjoy with limited shade. Suggest this the last choice of your list."
,,A fantastic way to spend a day; beautiful birds and very clean.,5.0,,"Always worth a visit when in Singapore, especially if ticket is purchased online, combined with the Zoo and Night Safari as you get a good discount for all of them together."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,The most memorable experience my 6 year old will carry with her.from the word go ..the staff with warm welcoming smiles...till the end everything was perfect.the most colourful and yet the cleanest bird park i have ever visited. Amazing!!!
,,Must experience. ...,5.0,,The place is huge and with so many birds to see of different species...is amazing. I believe they have the largest collection of Toucans and hornbills in the world. Please keep some spare time for the visit. .because the place is big and worth visit every corner. The shows which are held at scheduled timings are a must see. Ensure you see all of them.
,,"Good fun with birds, even if you are not a bird lover",4.0,,"We went there with my 4.5 years old daughter & we had loads of fun.
We can actually enter the bird cages & see the birds in front of us (without cage or glass)
Lory loft is great fun where you can buy bird food for 3SGD & then all the parrots will come near you to taste it.
Its great fun with kids.
If you have very young kids (may be ~ 2years or so) I think they may not enjoy the park. This is because, for young kids, its difficult to locate a birds which are at some distance."
,,excellent learning for kids,5.0,,kids were so excited and learnt so much in one visit! the bird shows are not be missed. the waterfall is nice to visit.
,,Excellent for Kids,4.0,,"A wonderful and excellent place for kids to know about the Birds.. shows are excellent.
When we visit it was very humid, thanks to the Tram services, it wasn't that much tiring. You would be able to see lots of birds really up close and if you are there during the feeding time, its the best time to see the birds real close.
Dont Miss the Photo opportunities with birds"
,,Don't miss the bird show,5.0,,I went with my wife and after being here and specially after watching the bird show I would say that this is a must visit place! There are exotic birds and especially if you have kids they would love it to the core! The bird show and the environment awareness is what makes this place for me good!
,,Man make waterfall is over rated,4.0,,"The flamingos display as well as feed the penguins are fun areas for the kids. The water play is definitely a big win as well. The show that they have, the children loved them and it is amazing to see how they are able to train these birds. I personally love the snow owls. However, I am surprise that for the tram rides, we are only allow to get on once, at the beginning point, I would have thought it should have been unlimited. Children's fares are a little steep if all the displays are not open."
,,Amazing and Mesmerizing Experience,5.0,,"Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, Jurong Bird Park is just a place where one will forget the time and take an enjoyable stroll in the park. Its a great park for all ages of people. Filled with a variety of birds which are kept in their natural habitat preserved from the outer world. Once you enter the park after buying the tickets you can take a tram ride across the park. The ride stops at the major attractions in the park with running commentary all through. On the way you can see a variety of birds on the road. One can hop on and hop off at the desired location. The best part in the park is the Feeding the LORRY bird. You can buy their food for around $3 and enter their zone. The birds will flock you, will even sit on your hands and eat their food. It the most beautiful experience as you are one on one and closest to the nature. The other attraction include the several other bird feeding shown which are done by trained professionals. Another Major attraction is the BIRD SHOW that takes place at the Amphitheater located just near the entrance of the park. It just fabulous and mesmerizing. You will keep thinking of how would they have trained the birds. The staff inside the park is very cooperative and helpful. One can find soft drink vending machines all over but food is only available at the entrance or at major halts of the tram ride. Just a note of caution, one will have to walk a lot to catch up with the fascinating world of beautiful birds."
,,Birds everywhere,5.0,,"Birds everywhere and you even get a chance to interact and feed birds in the aviary. if you have kids, a place not to be missed."
,,"family vacation, great place to engage with kids",4.0,,very well laid out. Don't miss the bird shows in any case... must go place for kids to tell them how our plant should be treated...
,,Lots to see but book a taxi back!,4.0,,"This place has so many birds and in such a good layout. The feeding sessions are particularly good. Watch out for the prices of food at the entrance and if you live local or will be a regular visitor to there or the Singapore zoo parks which there are three other then consider an annual pass which also gives you 50% off food vouchers

I would say that there were bits we got caught out with a push chair and had to lift it up or down steps but there were probably ways around we didn't see.

Overall if you want a nice easy day enjoying the different species then go for this. But do not wait in line for a taxi there, they never come it's so out the way. Either use a bus or better yet use a Singapore taxi app or ask locally/call one up you will wait ages otherwise"
,,Must visit for kids and adults alike....,5.0,,"This is a great place to visit when in Singapore. Kids will enjoy it as will adults too. Highlight was the bird Show and the free feeding zone. It is a full day activity if you want to see all the shows at the Bird Park. A large variety of birds at the park on show and very informative.
Recommend the penguin feeding- kids really enjoyed it.
Tickets are available at klook.com at a discounted price- check it before you buy."
,,Big Bird Park,4.0,,You can see all types of different birds in this Jurong bird park.Nice view and youncan take photos here
,,"Better than I expected, worth going!",4.0,,"We have toddlers, so it was tougher than others with more grown up kids. But it was pretty good, and we really enjoyed it. I would go again once kids are older, or if visitors come."
,,"Not boring at all, even if you are not into bird watching",4.0,,Actually you don't get to walk that much: You just hop from one attraction to the next. So surprising so many people take the little train. So surprised also to see birds so close and not afraid of men.
,,Must visit for kids and bird watchers,5.0,,"An excellent bird park with different varieties of birds. Penguins and Pink Flamingos (Caribbean Flamingos) are must watch. The best way to travel through the park is using the tram service, get down at different stops, and explore the areas surrounding the stop. One can feed the birds at the lorry loft. We missed the bird show."
,,Birds and then some More birds,5.0,,"This is one place which was on my list for quite sometime. If you can't go to Antartica to meet the Penguins then this is the place. It has some fantastic varieties of birds and in separate sections. There is a small train that is available for the lazy ones or people who has taken the group tour option but this is not a place for it. Instead Take a walk and spend time at each section. The most time I spent was at the Predatory Birds. My daughter loves them. If you are with your kids then it would be advisable to carry pen and small writing pad in case they want to jot down something. Though all the info can be googled but the experience of watching them live and taking notes is fun, believe me you won't repent it. The work that has gone into creating the artificial habitat is really commendable.

For the grown ups - if you are a bird lover and dont have time/patience/money to visit various places, then this is THE place"
,,Not just for bird watcher.,5.0,,Absolutley wonderful. Bird show is top rate. Give yourselves a few hours to fully appreciate all the aviaries and species on offer.
,,Amazing Birds in the park,5.0,,This is a must visit attraction of Singapore where you can have various birds giving their best in the Flying show.Penguins are very exclusive watch in the park.Highly recommended specially for Bird lovers.
,,Wow!,5.0,,"It's been more than 3 decades since my last visit and the gardens have matured beautifully. Catch it before it moves to Mandai where it'll need a few decades to mature. The shows were fantastic. Make sure you pop into the various aviaries, where you'll be spellbound by the denizens."
,,Birds around,5.0,,"Place to be visit, nice variety of birds enjoy walking and view of the birds. Some of them free walking around you some not. Pigeons are amazing and so beautiful colours that I did not know that there are so many different colours on those birds."

,,Good place for kids and bird lovers,4.0,,"The bird park is a good place for kids and bird lovers. The shows are good, do not miss them. The water park is small, but kids would love it, so pack some swimwear for them."
,,must visit for kids who love birds,5.0,,"lots of varieties of birds.will get a map from entrance.All the show timings and feeding times are mentioned in that.Lorry loft is the highlight in which you can feed lorry bird by youself.it may come and sit on your hand and eat.my son enjoyed it.wagons and prams are available for rent.If you can better to carry water and some fruits with you.Inside the park, food options were very limited as well as expensive"
,,Kee Kee,5.0,,We visited a bird park last year in Brazil and it was not half as nice as this tour. The separate bird shows were fantastic. Even the penguin feeding was a hit to watch.
,,nice collection of birds,5.0,,"the bird park has really upgraded itself since i last visited them a couple years back, the show still remains the same and the tram visit is a relaxing way to go around the place without stressing your feet"
,,why not the bird park?,5.0,,"Far too many visitors by pass visits to such places as the Jurong Bird Park and I always wonder why. This bird park is different to any others I have been to. The Jurong Bird Park is an ideal venue for wandering around, having a picnic, enjoying the day with friends and getting to know the birds of our region .....

Jurong Bird Park needs to be on the MUST SEE list for all visitors to Singapore."
,,Interesting birds which you won't see them outside,4.0,,"There are many special birds, I love the penguins! The shows are nice too, just wondering how the trainers actually managed to train the birds. You have to go in the morning and most probably you will take more than half day inside in order to see the shows. The show have different timings. It is better that you take a piece of the map when going in."
,,Great day out,5.0,,"Bought the four park ticket, and bird park is beautiful. Set in a tropical rainforest location. Beautiful birds and a funny show with the flamingoes and Pelicans. Can get there by bus so get the passes to get around the city"
,,Best day of my life!,5.0,,"Disclaimer - I am huge fan of birds. For me, they are the most glorious of all creations.
So it should not come as a surprise that I will be gushing about this place throughout the review.

Location:
Reaching Jurong Bird park is not difficult. However, being located on the outskirts of the city, it requires at least 1.5 hours to reach if you are using MRT and bus service. Simply follow the instructions on the website on how to reach there and you will be fine.

Tickets:
We purchased the park hopper package, which included entry for Jurong Bird Park, River Cruise, Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, which costed us SGD62. I will strongly urge everyone to do the same, as this package is discounted compared to individual tickets (even if you plan on going to two locations, it still works out cheaper)

Zoo Premises:
Zoo itself is vast and large, with a tropical setting. It gets hot and humid during afternoons. Wear light clothes. To go around, you can either walk, or use the tram services, which cost around SGD10 for 2 people. Once you enter, a bunch of noisy parrots greets you, raising all sorts of hell, chattering really loud. For me, their noises were pure music. They sit on a perch with trainers and visitors are encouraged to take pictures with them. You can't have one on your shoulder or anything, but you can hold a branch on which several of these birds are perched. You will also have those red plumed macaws around, but you can't interact with them because they are not used to different people touching them. Once you take the pictures, you can buy them from nearby kiosk at an exorbitant price. That was real money gouging tactic employed by the management of all the zoos in Singapore. We gave it a pass.
There are several enclosures housing amazing exotic birds. My favorite ones were Birds of Paradise and Parrot and macaws enclosures. The zookeepers seem to take great care of the birds and have great love and respect for them.
Zoo also has one of the largest Aviaries in the world, which houses the most talkative of birds I have seen - Lories! You can buy a sugar solution for SGD3 and feed these amazing birds as they perch near you or on you! I enjoyed every waking moment in that place and my wife had to throw a tantrum to get me out of it.
For me, the high point of the visit was the High Flyers show, where i got to interact with a bird when it flew up from its trainer, took a SGD50 note from my palm and flew back to its trainer (money was of course returned by the same bird!) That incident was one of the best moments of my life! The King of the Skies show should also not be missed.

Make sure that you spend an entire day at this amazing place. Anything less, and you are not doing yourself any justice.

Also, if you are on a tight budget, make sure that you come to the place stocked with a few supplies - like water bottles and some food / snacks like sandwiches. The water is upwards of SGD3 (500ml only) and a quick bite for a single person will easily be SGD15. You will find a couple of places in the park where you can stock up on your water supplies, but it won't appear on the map. Ask someone from the staff. One place I definitely remember is the Waterfall Aviary."
,,A very special place.,5.0,,"My husband and I spent most of a day here with friends, while stopping in Singapore on a cruise ship. What a fabulous place! So much to see; stunning birds and gardens, and several entertaining performances - I have never heard a bird sing ""happy birthday"" before! This is a huge park, so allow yourself plenty of time to meander around and see it all. It was not at all crowded. In fact I'm surprised it wasn't busier. We took a taxi to the park - it's a bit out of the city centre. Well worth a visit!"
,,Nicely done.,5.0,,"I hate seeing animals in cages and usually cringe at zoo's so the thought of a bird park had me a little apprehensive... but it was very well done and we had an enjoyable day.

If birds ""must"" be put in cages it's done as well as possible here."
,,Jurong bird park,5.0,,"Jurong bird park is located at Jurong Hill ,halg hour side from Singapore.
It is the world's largest bird park .
You have a mni-train to get a park ride.
All areas are worth watching- Parrot zone, eagle, flamingos, Ostrichs,
The variety of different species from all over the world is worth watching.
Penguine experience is the most thrilling one.
One must visit Jurong bird park during his stay at Singapore.
There were a couple of a very good shows with flamigos ,vultures & eagle."
,,JBP !!!,4.0,,"Loved watching different variety of birds !!Loved the high Flyers show!! But some thing within me said that the Penguins are not kept properly like the way they have to be treated , could find them very dull enough. Hope these birds are not used for our happiness !!"
,,Far away from the city centre,4.0,,The location is a bit far away but it was nice to visit it once. I can't say we saw something incredible probably just like in most tropical birds parks.
,,Fabulous experience/ great opportunity for self exploration for kids,5.0,,"Visited the Bird park with my 7 year old daughter after 2 years of Singapore stay... realized that this was a treasure I undervalued so far.... ha ha.
Tremendous opportunity for kids to self explore nature/ conservation/ learn about wildlife... Avoid the tram - they will miss out on all the experience...
The shows were fantastic (apart from the paid lunch for parrot talk, unless u buy the package).. don't miss the shows.
Explore the breeding & research centre for sure.. lots to learn for kids.
Take sunglasses/ hats/ water & plenty of cash (no ATM/ most of the kiosks don't accept cards).
Enjoy the experience."
,,Not worth it!!,2.0,,"We went after the read up on the website sold it extremely well. We turnt up and it seemed lovely at first. The shows were great but the Rest of the park was a wash out.
We paid extra for lunch with the parrots. The show was basically the same as the free one and the food was very limited and not very nice at all.
The saving grace was the kids water park."
,,Bird lovers paradise,4.0,,Good place in singapore for bird lovers. Kids will enjoy much. Well maintained place. Taxi stand is near by main enterence.
,,So so,3.0,,"Perhaps we were visiting at the wrong time,it was raining. Nothing much to see. Even my 4 years old daughter were asking where are the birds inside the cage,most of the cages looks like empty. Perhaps the birds were sleeping or just hiding from the rain. But,i still recommend this place,it is to support wildlife reserves."
,,"Birds, birds and more birds!!",5.0,,"We went their in the morning, started with feeding the african penguins ...they were adorable...the birds show specially the kings of the sky show was too good...overall morning spent well :)"
,,Excellent place for everyone,5.0,,"Located just 15-20 mins from Boon Lay MRT, this place is paradise for kids & all birds loving ppl.Reach here early to enjoy all the shows & don't hesitate to be a part of the volunteer.The acrobats done by the birds will make you nostalgic.
A very nice experience - Don't miss it."
,,JURONG BIRD PARK (MUST VISIT),5.0,,"One of the Best man made aviaries in South East Asia or probably in the World. MUST VISIT with family of any age. Children really enjoy the Bird Shows and Monorail Ride. Very well maintained, just Superb. This spot is Sr.Citizen friendly, clean toilets, nice and easy walkways which can accommodate wheel chairs."
,,visit if you have kids and time,5.0,,A good place in Singapore to spend your time with kids and make them feel the real nature all around
,,I dis not enjoy,2.0,,"Felt really sad to see some of the big birds stuck in sad cages...not allowing enough room to spread their wings properly...i think I was comparing it to the fantastic zoo...it does not compare.

A very depressing outing and quite far out from everything - have to drive or take a cab!

Ill skip it!"
,,Amazing place,5.0,,They have sooooo many birds. We covered the entire park in 2.5 hours but you can easily spend more time. They have many activities- from feeding birds to shows. Must visit in Singapore.
,,Truly Paradise,5.0,,"A very beautiful nature park with tons of free ranging birds flying everywhere surrounding us.

Feeling so small around all the majestic and colorful spp of birds, never a dull moment.

Truly a wonderful paradise, would be a pity to shift the Bird Park to Mandai when the existing one is so awesome.
The birds are awesome, the show was great, the scenery was amazing with all the landscapes enhancing the whole park.

Everything is so peaceful and grand.

We felt like we have really stepped into the the dinosaur era when we were at the Dino Descendants aviary.

A small letdown was when we realized many guests actually ride the tram for free because no one was checking on them.
It was unfair for those like us who bought it at $5.

Hopefully the management can look into this issue.

Overall an amazing paradise where we will be revisiting again and again!

Must Go :
- Lory Loft
- Waterfall Aviary
- Dinosaur Descendants Exhibit
- Horn Bill & Toucans Exhibits
- High Flyers Show

Tip :
Do expect to spent 3/4 day in this park so you wont rush to see everyhting, we spent 1 whole afternoon and yet missed a few exhibit!"
,,A Fantastic Range of Birds,5.0,,As a bird nut this was a really impressive experience. There is a really impressive diversity present. I would warn against the shows however. I may be a bit of a snob on that account but I found them a little disappointing in comparison to other similar affairs I have seen. I would also not suggest eating there as there are better options elsewhere.
,,Beautiful day with the birds.,5.0,,"we spend about 3 hrs here, but i think if youd like to read about all the birds you see you d want a little more time. It was a beautiful clean park, and all the birds looked very happy and healthy. food and drink can be purchased, and you can have your picture taken with some large birds for a small price. There is a bit of walking but theres also a cart that takes you around the park if needed. The bird show is very funny. The birds are very well trained & are so clever. its good the audience can interact as part of the show also.
A worth while place to visit for sure."
,,A Not to miss out place,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park have wide range of species in the world. don't miss out the High Flyes and Kings of skies show, Both the shows are well conceived and presented and interactive mode. Don't miss the Penguin Coast, water fall aviary, Lory Loft, Research & Breeding Centre, Park is well maintained. staff are friendly, informative."
,,Kids will love it,4.0,,"Good collection of birds and spacious park to roam around for a day. Shows organised by the staff was very good, which involves the viewers also. I have seen lot of kids enjoying the show. Worth a visit."
,,Awesome place for aviary fans.,4.0,,Beautiful indoor aviary and bird park with thousands of colored examples of flights nicely situated among trees and well apointed landscapes. Walk around with awe aspiring photo ops fir shutterbugs...great place to spend a few hours.
,,Pretty good,4.0,,The park is pretty well spaced out and you can go for a walk in the morning. The afternoons are really hot so the transportation provided between attractions is useful. There are snack shops in between so you are always close to food and water. In some areas you can get really close to the birds and it's really good. In some others it is pretty difficult to spot the birds. The birds of prey show was really good.
,,Good collection of birds,5.0,,It is fun place for children and adults equally.Birds have been collected from across the globe.Colourful parrots from Latin America are real delight.
,,Well managed park,5.0,,Spent an afternoon here. It has plenty of birds to see. It has a nice kids section with a water park there to cool them off. The live show was great.
,,Excellent Place for a Family Outing,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a must visit place in Singapore. The bird park spread across acres of land. It is divided into multiple zones. You can either walk or hop into one of the electric carts run for the tourists. I also saw a small museum located in the premises along with two love shows, one was exclusively on raptors, the other show had different types of birds play acting their parts. We also clicked pictures standing behind a flock of pelicans. At the entrance pictures can be taken with parakeets. You can pay SGD 25 for instant photos or ask the photgrapher to click your photos in your digicams or phones"
,,Avain Theme Park - lots to see,4.0,,"This is an attraction for all the family...plenty to see - take your time to wander paths and exhibits to see a huge range of birds that are not readily seen by city dwellers.

The park has a bird conservation program and helps with endangered species.

There are a number of shows morning and afternoon with trained birds of different breeds entertaining park visitors.

The complex is not particularly large although a basic fitness level would be good as the park is quite hilly.

There is a small tram that runs around the main path, there are only three stops where maybe ten or twelve would give flexibility to elderly or special needs guests.

I would have seen more - after walking and exploring the first third of the park I had to catch the tram and missed out on some really nice exhibits.

Recommended....its easy to get to...take the SMRT to Boon Lay interchange then catch bus 194 - very simple,."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Go and visit and come back with great memories. We went by the SMRT and it took about one and half hour to reach. The park has many enclosed caged birds of different types. The best was the bird feeding. There is a small water play area for children as well.
,,Well worth it for bird lovers,4.0,,"A good variety of shows.

The larger, walk-in aviaries allow you to feed and get right up close to the birds.

Some of the other aviaries could stand to be a bit bigger though.

Go in the morning, as the feeding trays are removed about an hour before closing time, so it will be harder to see the birds.

Don't come on a rainy day though, as the birds will be mostly hiding undercover as well."
,,Must for children !,5.0,,"Jurong bird park is far from usual Singapore attractions. The park has so many birds that you just give up after watching some exotic ones. So my advice is ...plan carefully. Reach there by 10 am ...start with the penguins.... watch the show in the auditorium... Do the photo shoot...resume again...take a break at the lunch with birds. There you can have a personal parrot show while you lunch. They offered chicken, fish, some kind of veg ...fruits, ice creams etc. There you can get that much advertised photo of parrot sitting on your hand. There is one small platform...Lorry loft... where you buy some bird feed for 3S$ and feed the small birds. Be sure to reach there early otherwise these small birds don't come near you once they are full. Children do enjoy it very much. And if you are old and no mood to walk...then there are carriages you can use...but you don't get to see all the birds from the vehicle."
,,amazing bird show,4.0,,The 2 shows they put together is spectacular and educational .Even though you take buggy ride you will not see all the exhibits and the man made water fall . If you have to see that you have to brave the heat and irritating perspiration.
,,"One of a kind, don't be surprised to see birds walk in front of you",4.0,,"We are a family of 3, with a 6 year old child. We visited the bird park on 08-June, part of our full day coverage of all the 4 parks.

TIckets: I strongly suggest you buy them online, there is a 4 park hopper which we purchased. It saves a good deal of money & covers all the parks. Pay that additional $5 SGD for the tram ride, it's an saving grace from the long walks in an hot weather.

Experience: Fantastic. The park is very well maintained, the tram ride plays an audio of which side to look & what type of birds do you see. There are stations which you can hop on & off.
Bird feeding, I strongly recommend it. Buy the feeding cup & walk along the bridge, waive the cup & wait for a bird to come. The birds need to feel safe & trust you to come that close, most of them are very small and delicate. Keep your hand near the railing so that they can get some support to stand and dip their tiny tongue into the cup. It is a surreal experience of kindness & connect.
Rest of the experience is walk, observe, click & connect to nature.

Traveller Tip: a) If you have booked online, simply show the pdf ticket at the entrance for scanning. b) Check the weather for a 7 day period before you book, monsoon can be a bummer. Your tickets once booked are valid for 7 days from issue. c) They have free shuttle rides to connect you with the zoo, find out the timings from the counter"
,,Natural reserve of Birds,3.0,,A nice day activity for children and adults lots of birds in natural habitat. Lot of shows happening around the day. Artificial nature at its best.
,,A fantastic place for kids,5.0,,"Kids will definitely love this place. It's a very well laid down Park. The variety of birds is amazing. The best way to visit the park is on foot as the tram simply takes you to the aviaries, bypassing all the remaining exhibits.
Apart from the bird exhibits, our favorite was Lorry Loft Aviary Penguin Coast. Lorry loft aviary is a covered jungle giving birds a natural environment to live and breed. The most fascinating part was feeding the parakeets by hand.
Waterfall aviary was equally good experience.
Penguin Coast gives an opportunity for a close encounter with the Emperor Penguins.
Flamingos were beautiful. Birds of prey exhibits were very good.
The bird show was the best part.Just checkout the show timings from the park's website.
Being vegetarian , we got veg biryani in Hawk Cafe. It cost you SGD 8, but is was really good.
The best way to reach Jurong Bird Park is by MRT. Get down at Boon Lay MRT station and take a bus from there. The bus interchange is exactly adjacent to the MRT Station so it is going to be very convenient. From there it's just a 10-15 minutes bus ride to the park."
,,A great range of birds,4.0,,A very well laid out park with the greatest range of birds I have seen anywhere. The shows are both educational and entertaining. The only issue I had was the amount of walking distance between cover when raining.
,,Family visit,4.0,,"We went to see the bird park thinking it was attached to the Zoo, which it is not! In fact they are far apart. but the kids enjoyed the walks and the birds and most of all the little water park inside where you can also sit and get a nice cold drink and snacks."
,,Various interactions with Birds,5.0,,"Excellent for Bird lovers, wildlife enthusiasts, kids in general and family visits. Talking birds, colourful birds, birds that eat food out of your hands, Singing birds and much much more. Extremely well maintained. One of Singapore''s best. Inculcates in you a love for animals and birds with just one visit. Dont miss this."
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,The Bird Show is a highlight. Well organised and entertaining. Looking down on hornbills and macaws in flight is a very rare and colourful experience.
,,Another brill day out with teenagers,5.0,,We were lucky that we arrived just in time to view the bird displays which were amazing. Very intelligent parrots etc who all seemed to thoroughly enjoy showing off. Free flying and taking part in a display which surely must have taken many hours to arrange.
,,"Nice, but not enough for one full day of exploration",3.0,,"It has been quite a few years since I have last visited Jurong Bird Park. I decided to bring my family to visit during the school holidays. First of all, it was not crowded. I suppose the travelling distance is a key consideration. Second, the exhibits were quite spaced out, and there's a lot of variety of species to view. That's good for avid fans. Third, the walking can be quite tiring. You need to be prepared to walk around for quite a bit. There are not many places for people to rest. Fourth, the shows are not really that fascinating. I must qualify that I have only seen two shows - high fliers and birds of prey. The first one was not that bad, but the second was a little dull.

I guess I may be a little more picky because I was comparing this with the Zoo, which offers a lot more different animal species to view and learn about. But it's still worth a visit with your children, especially if you want them to get in contact with nature more often."
,,Super place to visit,5.0,,Great place to visit. We love looking at all the birds and it is in such wonderful rainforest surroundings. You get chance to see beautiful birds up close and can interact with them. It is so exciting feeding the Lorys with sugar water as they come and perch on your arms. So much to see and do. Plenty of shops and food outlets.
,,A memorable experience,5.0,,"I was not very willing to go here but went because of my daughter. I must say that the visit to the Jurong Bird Park is among my most memorable experiences.

Positives:
1. So many variety of birds
2. Well-arranged
3. Shows are the highlights
4. Kids play area is also one of the attraction

Negatives:
1. Connectivity to an extent as you can reach their only by MRT+Bus combination (public transport)

Please visit and don't forget to watch different shows."
,,Lot of Hype,2.0,,The facility has deteriorated since my earlier visit about 10 years ago. Many birds look sick and are put up in small cages.
,,Very good,4.0,,We had gone in the afternoon so most of the shows were around the time we visited the park.We thoroughly enjoyed the shows and what lovely birds.
,,Birds of A Feather,5.0,,I was impressed to see a huge flock of Flamingos at the park.The Birds of Prey show was an interesting aspect to our trip too.Plus the underwater viewing of turtles was another plus.Very worthwhile day out for families.There is also a water playground for the children which definitely proved a popular activity with the kids
,,Interesting array of birdlife,4.0,,"We have had several trips to Singapore, and had yet to visit the bird park.
We booked our tickets online, which creates a small discount, and just used the image on the iPhone to get in (very easy!).
We sat in on two show attractions, the Birds of Prey and the High Flyer Show, both fun, entertaining and informative.
The habitat displays are great with an interesting collection of birds.
Certainly worth a visit!"
,,Must See for Tourists,4.0,,Jurong Bird Park needs at least 4 Hours to properly enjoy. First check for the show timings before you start your tour of the park. Do not miss the Bird Show at the amphitheatre. Also do not miss out the walk into the enclosure of parrots and parakeets where you can feed them and take pics with them. The tram ride is useless. The souvenirs are all exhorbitantly priced.
,,Superb and Real Treat for Bird Lovers,4.0,,"Had a very good experience with the Birds in the park Staff was very encouraging and enjoyed holding the birds in my life, could never had a such a good expereince with birds
Must visit for Photos Hops and Bird Lovers.
Half day is sufficient to cover the bird park completely"
,,First class,5.0,,"With a wide variety of birds from all around the world this park is a must see. Large walk in Avairies, one with a 100 foot waterfall inside, present the birds in their natural habitats. No expense has been spared in presenting these birds, or maintaining the enclosures and grounds. Two different shows containing free flying birds add to the experience. We spent 6 hours at this park"
,,Beautiful Animals,5.0,,I visited with my 21 year old son and we loved seeing the many variety of birds and learning about them. The trails are easy to walk and if you prefer to take the tram it came around regularly. A great way to spend time with family!
,,Always a fun visit,5.0,,"Have been to the bird park 3 times and it's a great place which offers close encounters with birds. I never get tired of the Birds of Prey show involving eagles, ravens and vultures. The show at Pools Amphitheatre is a must see as well. You will be blown away. It was amazing to see the owls too and my absolute favourite was the snowy owl."
,,"Still fun to go there, but a bit dated.",3.0,,"Great variety of birds, lots of attractions, tram to take you around. Trails are walk able but strenuous for those with disabilities. Some cage displays are too small for the animals."
,,Bird Shows,3.0,,"The JBP is like any other Bird Park, with some exotic Bird collection. Best is the two type of Bird shows conducted at fixed timings. Amazing to see the Birds so well trained, and at comfort among public."
,,Lots of fun - but not everywhere state-of-the-art,4.0,,"We visited as a family with teenagers and had a lot of fun in the large aviaries. No problem to reach the park with a direct bus from a nearby MRT station. While the outdoor enclosures and few large aviaries are quite modern and fun, lots of birds still have to live in old-fashioned cages of very limited size. The ticket is not cheap, you should use the ca 10% discount when you book in advance on their Internet site (mobile ticket OK)"
,,Kids enjoyed lory feeding,5.0,,"Lory Loft is definitely the star attraction in Jurong Bird Park. My kids enjoyed the close interaction with lories through feeding them food. Also, in our previous visit, we were given 1-year unlimited entry to the park for the price of 1-day ticket."
,,Only worth the shows and nothing else,3.0,,"The place is packed with birds of different sizes and colours. But apart from the shows like the High Flyers Show and others, there is nothing much to see in the area. The whole park can be completed in one hour. Certainly not worth the travel. Only buses go there, and they take a long time to come."
,,Entering to the world of Birds!!,5.0,,"It's a beautiful bird Park with lots and lots of Birds. My 3 year old son enjoyed to the fullest, the water splash was added fun in hot summer . Overall an amazing experience, the bird shows were amazing so a must watch."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Lots of birds and watch out for the show timings. IMO the bird park by itself needs better part of a day to watch these beautiful creatures. There is a bird nursing area where u can watch the young chicks being taken care of. Must for family with young kids.
,,Must go,5.0,,"You can't miss jurong bird park if in Singapore. Please take time to go there especially if your with kids . children will really enjoy the shows.
Take a map from the ticketing area and check the show timings so you plan your time inside the park. Don't miss the shows especially the ""high flyers "" where they show the different macaws. Macaws are so beautiful and colorful.
The bird park is clean, kids friendly and safe as you can see pics. Strollers and wagons are available.
There are places to eat inside the park. Drinks are available at most points and tram stations in the park.
You can also take a tram ride inside the park first so you get an idea of what's where. You can also get down near the show areas or places of interest to you.

There are different feeding and you can purchase food to feed like flamingo. Then there's pelican chat.
Shows are in two places: hawks arena and pools amphitheatre (the vulture eagles show).

You can purchase parkhopper tickets at great discounts and tickets are valid for 7 days so even if you can't make it on the day you plan you can still go another day as long as it's within 7 days of purchase.

You also get extra 10%off if you fly silk air."
,,Far from the city but worth it to visit!,4.0,,They have trams but you could enjoy better if you walk on the trail. We consume almost our whole day visiting this place so you could watch all the animal show. This is worth to visit if you are animal lover.
,,A nice day at the Bird Park,3.0,,"We arrived just before midday, and was disappointed to find that the shows are in the morning and late afternoon, so as we had to return to our hotel by 4, we missed out on all,shows. We felt some aspects of the park disappointing. the large eagles and vultures were in a small enclosure, and there were many Penguins in what seemed such an unnatural setting, with not much room to swim as they would in the wild. I rate the park just ""ok"""
,,Too hot but too good,4.0,,"If you are bringing kids, make sure to bring swimming attire. The water park inside is great. Bring snacks to save money and dont miss the show!!!"
,,Must see if ur in Singapore for 1st time,4.0,,Located 23 km from little india it is a unique park where u can see various birds from various part of the world .The park authority tried to create natural environment for them.The bird shows are very interesting.u can also njoy the tram ride.It cost 35 Singapore dollar per head including tram ride.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Plan for a full day to really enjoy the experience, don't miss the bird shows. Kids had a great time"
,,Kids will love it...,4.0,,"If you are with kids then only go, otherwisw give it a miss. there are birds show, check the timing before going."
,,"Where lives colour - pretty, exotic birds",5.0,,"First view was of the Penguins (emperor, king, humboldt, macaroni, african) in a cooled tunnel like structure. Watched them waddle clumsily and cutely across land and glide gracefully inside the water and also a couple that seemed to be a deep conversation (a tad tending towards acrimony I felt, with one of them gesturing pretty wildly with its flippers to the other one who was equally vocal in its response). They typically slide down a slope and land on their cute bellies which is called “tobogganing"".
Followed this with a penguin feeding session where we could experience feeding them small fish. Went on to some colourful macaws and a group of flamingoes (more orange than pink). Visited the bird breeder where they kept exhibits from the time an egg is hatched to the bird weaning, preparing food for the birds, the bird feeders, incubators and finally releasing them into the park. This was followed by the show ""the king of the skies"" where birds like eagles, hawks, owls and vultures were made to fly around an arena covered with spectators. The birds of paradise show featured exotic birds like macaws, toucans, pelicans, talking multi-lingual amazon parrot 'Amigo' who even sang Happy Birthday in English and some malay song and the cockatoo. Walked through some enclosures that housed the king fisher, the crowned pigeon, peacocks and peahens, starling, pelicans, spoonbills, hornbills etc. Took the tram to cover the remaining zones covering the lory loft (several small lorries that were being fed through small nectar bowls with people walking across suspension bridges with many birds flying close to us), the flightless birds - ostrich, the emu, cassowary and the graceful swans gliding over the water and then a walk through the waterfall aviary that housed the largest man made waterfall in a bird sanctuary."
,,Wowow!,5.0,,"This is a park which you must not ever miss. As soon as you enter, you can take pictures with parrots. They are so cute and adorable. Next on the agenda are the shows conducted by the hawk/vultures. It is beautiful to see them so well trained. As you go around the park, there are flamingos which are pink and so beautiful. The park also has an area for nocturnal birds and there you will see a unique owl called as snow/white owl. It is beautiful. Ensure this park is on your plans when you visit Singapore."
,,Love birds,4.0,,"Another great place to visit in Singapore. A short bus drive and you are there. What I loved about this bird park is that most birds are in walk-In-aviaries, so you are up close to them. Great photo opportunities without the cage wires getting in the way of that perfect photo. The bigger parrots are caged. Their enclosures are nice and big for them to fly around."
,,Beautiful Birds at Jurong Bird park,5.0,,"If you going to Singapore, this is one place you must visit. Take a map at the entrance and check on the timings of the show. There is a tram that takes you round the park. We reached in time for the bird feeding. It was a fabulous experience walking around and letting birds peck on the worms. Parrot paradise, penguin coast and flamingo pool should not be missed."
,,Be free with the birds,5.0,,Enjoyed having few parrots sit on my hand and sip the nectar out of a cup. Once a in a lifetime experience!
,,Huge birds all around,4.0,,"The Jurong bird park has on display a wide variety of exotic birds and some of these are really huge and wild. They would definitely attract you with their colours and sounds. There is also a place where you can have trained birds come very close to you under the supervision of a staff. At another place, trained superstar birds exhibit their painting skills, speaking skills and IQ skills too. Children will love this place."
,,Awesome family Outing,5.0,,Spent wonderful time with my wife and kid. High Flyers Show is the Must see and my best activity at this place.
,,A splendid collection of a large variety of birds,5.0,,"This Bird Park has a large collection of birds wherein the inmates are so beautifully taken care of. You can actually see the love and care the handlers have for the birds when they interact. The enclosures for each category of birds are great and they are maintained very well and clean too. As you move around the bird park, it gives you a feeling of tranquility. The Park has a huge man made waterfall.

The staff are cordial and courteous.

The trams are very convenient. The Park offers wheelchairs for free on a first come first serve basis. they also offer strollers/wagons for kids, albeit at a price.

There are 2 bird shows twice in a day. Both the bird shows are very interactive and informative. each show is for 20-30 mins.

An absolute must for kids and for a nature/bird lover. For a relaxed visit, keep aside at least 3-4 hours.

Try and visit the tourist places in Singapore when the Schools DONT HAVE HOLIDAYS as that would be the time when the attractions would not be very crowded. you can get the school term dates on the internet. We visited on a Monday in the third week of May."
,,Mind relax & Must add as favourite place to visit,5.0,,"The place where I prefer to visit again and again, even visiting Singapore to spent some time in this place is my wish."
,,must see,5.0,,"very well planned and gives us a glimpse of all the birds of these region, and natural habitate is provided and all the information is well displayed, the tram provides good access to all the areas"
,,Short trip,3.0,,"Brought my 6 year old to the bird park for a walk. It is quite refreshing to be away from the city. However, in my opinion the birdpark does need new and fresh ideas to invigorate the park. The park itself has great potential to inspire interest and love for birds."
,,"Unique, interactive bird park!",4.0,,The bird shows are the highlights of this place. The painstaking efforts taken by the team shows in the exemplary show that is on display. The final fashion parade by the birds is an ultimate climax.
,,"Birds are zoo filler animals, this place was a filler park. Worth going once.",3.0,,"I love zoos and all other attractions (Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and River Safari) are excellent but this was just ok. Birds are the animals you look at in between the other cool animals, they're filler. My mother loved it but she is 62 and talks to birds all day long. I enjoy a good Hornbill and there was actually a good selection of different species of those.
Overall, it is worth a visit once. Good ice cream in the food part."
,,Bird Park,4.0,,"If there's direct MRT station to this park, it would be more fantastic.
The park is quite complete, many kind of birds. And what I love the most from this park is it is not smelly and it is clean!
There's bird show in particular time. Make sure you don't miss the show.
There's also man made waterfall. Quite nice.
Overall it was an amazing experience"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The bird park is an attraction in Singapore you cannot miss in your itinerary. It is a very big area, but a paid tram service is available to those who cannot walk. There are beautiful colorful birds, flying freely in big open cages. From penguins and emus to macaws and vultures, his bird park has it all. In fact, there is also a feeding time, in which one gets to feed the flying friends. I recommend that you have an entire day to see the bird park, because you will need some time to digest the beauty of the birds.
The best part about the park however, is the bird show at the end. You cannot miss the bird show at the end. It is an interactive entertainment session with the audience, with trained birds acting to the trainers will. It has plenty of entertaining content, like parrots singing, and parrots playing competitive games against other parrots."
,,Spectacular display of a wide variety of birds,5.0,,We spent an entire morning wandering around the bird park admiring the wide variety of birds (which you can actually see) and taking in two of the free displays that were both educational and visually spectacular. We chose to take the train and connecting bus which was very cheap.
,,Worth a trip,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is great for anyone who enjoys zoos. Like all the zoos in Singapore, the park is clean, the scenery perfect for photography lovers, the animal shows are informative, and there is a small splash pad for the kids to cool off after 1-3 enjoyable hours walking around the park, depending on your pace. Make sure you bring swimsuits to change into as there is a changing room available. Parents can sit next to the splash pad in the shade and enjoy an ice cream while they wait for their kids."
,,Wonderful,4.0,,"The park is home to variety of birds and even houses an amazing artificial waterfall. Try to walk it up, its not as big as the zoo. Start early, if you cant do the entire park then wait for the tram at one of the stations. Walking gives you a better view of the birds. The bird show starts at 11.00 a.m so be sure you complete the walk before that and are at the show which is to your left."
,,Bird Park,5.0,,"While we were in Singapore we caught the train and connecting bus to Jurong Bird Park, easy to do. We walked for a few hours around the park and enjoyed it. The birds are really lovely we especially enjoyed the flamingos they are really colourful. The weather was great too"
,,Amazing bird park,5.0,,A good bird park with lot of birds and you can enjoy the nature. Its little bit far away from the city. However its very well connected through MRT and taxis are easily available.
,,Very very impressive!,5.0,,"Do not miss their shows at 3 pm and 4 pm in the open amphitheater. Very beautifully trained birds and must appreciate the skills of their trainers. For all the age groups and definitely not gonna make you regret.
Easy to reach by green line of MRT at Boonlay and take a bus number 194 to reach at the entrance of this park.
Better to visit from 11 am so that you can participate in the various activities like bird feeding and all which is very interesting.
Must visit place in Singapore at least for the bird shows if not whole day."
,,The bird show is lovely!,5.0,,"There are a variety of bird performances - by Macaws, Hornbills, Flamingos, Pelicans and others. Kids will love this. An Amazon bird even sings and counts!"
,,Great Birds Collection,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Parks is one of the popular attraction in Singapore. This is my third visit, and the first one was in 1981. There are so many birds species from around the world. The park was very well organized, clean and well maintained. Very good park for family and kids."
,,Very good,5.0,,I liked the bird park..this is my second visit first being in 2006..for photography the bigger birds are not given any more...but still the park is worth visit totally...Worth the mention is the photographer who clicks photographs with birds near the entrance...with so hot and humid climate and so many people coming he had the same level of enthusiasm from morning till evening...really did appreciate the nature of people there
,,Get closer to nature,5.0,,Learn all that you want to learn from visitng this park. I would love to post few pictures may be later. But go with your families and enjoy every kind of the bird species.
,,Birds from everywhere,4.0,,"We caught the MRT and then connected to a bus which took us straight to the entrance of the park. We were planning on spending the whole day there and we certainly did. There is so much to see, an absolutely magnificent display of birds from around the world. I was especially excited to see a toucan in real life, they are so beautiful. We managed to catch the Kings of the Skies show and the High Flyers show as well as the Pelican Encounter and enjoyed them all, and it‘s nice to get up so close to the birds. We also had tickets for the tram which takes you all the way around the park with various stops along the way for you to hop on and off."
,,Amazing birds,4.0,,"Nature beauty great way kept, hats of to effort to maintain so beautifully so ,any birds, also no birds will come to you,"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore, don't miss it. Please visit lorry loft and don't miss the shows. I visit this place once in 3 months and love to spend whole day. Not good for rainy day."
,,Educational,4.0,,Kids and adults will be very amazed with the bird show and all the attractions catered. A pity it was a rainy afternoon thus we were not able to explore everything inside park should book 3days beforehand for the tram tour to check availability for those with aching legs like me
,,wonderful,5.0,,worth for the money. excellent for children. water play is also there for children. need whole day. bit far. but easy to travel and can see Singapore around.
,,worth visiting,5.0,,wonderful place with colorful birds...we went on jurong bird park's 45th anniversary and got a special goodie bag too ;) The bird shows are amazing..outside food is allowed..
,,Flamingo's beautiful,5.0,,It is worth visiting the Bird Park if you only go to see the birds singing and counting etc. Many other things to see
,,Good,4.0,,"If you don't want to spend all your time trawling the shops etc, then this is a nice half day out, especially if you like birds! We got there by MTR and bus, fairly straightforward journey though you do need to make sure you have coins to pay the bus fare.
Some of the enclosures look a bit sad and neglected , others are delightful. We didn't see any of the shows they put on, am sure for families it is great fun."
,,Amazing place for my family,5.0,,"Amazing place to visit with family...We had witnessed beautiful birds and different kinds of birds as well...We also saw how these birds laid eggs, how they hatched, were feeded, foods they eat, different kids of eggs etc.. It was simply great with our family.. You could use the tram as well if not willing to walk for long distance inside."
,,Good collection of birds,3.0,,Good experience. The bird shows conducted in the park is unmissable. Appreciate the efforts put in to train the birds
,,Kids will be amazed,5.0,,Nice place to bring your kids to. My kids were so in awe looking at the show and at the variety of birds available. They were tired but I know the trip was worth it.
,,Hot!,4.0,,"My goodness, it was really hot.
Nothing can compare to the original-Singapore Zoo. But this park isn't bad.
Remember the following:
1. Stay hydrated.
2. Take the tram rather than walking. The park consists of rolling hills so it's tough for kids.
3. Go to the shows. They are interactive and they're fun.
4. Stay indoors between 12-2. Or go to the built in water park to cool down.
5. If you're into buying souvenirs, wait for the end of shows. They sell stuffed animals after the shows on special."
,,Extensive range of birds but outdated park,3.0,,"The place is in industrial district. They plan to move it in the same area as the zoo. The place is not that big. The ponds are very dirty (with algae, not trash) and smelly of animal poops. The species list is quite extensive. There is few domes where we can get super close to the birds. There is wet area for children. Few restaurant, mostly Indian food for some unknown reason. There is a tram going around the park which you can ride one time before 2 pm and multiple times after 2 pm. The bird shows are must-see events and the bird talks are very educational."
,,Must visit for bird lovers,4.0,,Amazing collection of different types of birds. Don't miss the bird shows. Its better not to visit during hot day or a rainy day.
,,Vast Variety of Birds ! Must Visit for sure!,5.0,,"Like to see many coloured wings - Head to this Jurong Bird Park.
1. The way the whole park is organised is wonderful.
2. Please do check the Bird show timings and be present for all of them, its a treat for sure for all age groups.
3. There is a place where you can feed the parrots, these nice creatures come and sit on ur arm and eat the offered feed.
4.Take pictures, i can assure you of loads of colours ( Like my pic below)
5. Please don't miss the education center, they have a display of hatching egg's, they display just born birds, the feeding, the food making, the weaning of birds. Its a treat to watch this.

In a nut shell- Do Not MISS this park."
,,Great Variety of Birds,4.0,,"This park is not in Central Singapore but it is easy to get to. The concierge at our hotel advised us to take the MRT to Boon Lay and then to take a bus. We took the time to look around the Boon Lay shopping centre, a mixture of high end and local shops and also a small local market. We decided to take a taxi (a short ride) to the park. The entrance area is welcoming with orchids growing over the archways. Inside we took a tram up the hill as it was very hot. We stopped at the rainbow lorikeets where our grandson fed them with nectar bought in the enclosure. We enjoyed looking at the brightly coloured macaws, the birds of prey, flamingoes and birds in the waterfall enclosure. The tram allows you to see what is in the park but you need to walk if you want to see the birds close up."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"A bit out of the way in Jurong... we had to go there by taxi because I don't think there's a convenient MRT station nearby. But worth it. Lots of exotic birds, and they put on some good shows at specific times."
,,Lovely bird park,5.0,,"This bird park is little far from Singapore city . Lots of colourful parrots , birds , penguins are there . Very well maintained , eagle show and the bird show are worthy to watch , there is a waterfall too in this park , a play area for kids and lots of small eat outs too , quite Sunny and tiring to walk around so we took a tram ride to go around the park . A park for nature and bird lovers ."
,,Colourful and informative,4.0,,"We came to kill time before our flight and fund a remarkable range of birdlife with unusually large aviaries and some information about the conservation work undertaken by the establishment. But the show with birds trained to fly through hoops, etc., made me think more of a circus and it is a shame that seemed to be what the crowds (particularly the locals) wanted. A train was available but sped past many aviaries so we disembarked and walked - good pavements and roads but it was hot and very humid."
,,HAlf day activity,5.0,,"Its very close to the singapore zoo, Its a nice place to goto if you like birds, Different species of birds are there. Also feeding shows with birds can also be done."
,,Good Park that got bad d/t 1 cashier girl,3.0,,"My family experience in this park is really awesome, the park is clean, the bathroom is clean and the tram mais really handy.
What's not gods of it is the service.
One of the waitress (near the amphitheater!
She can't really speak nicely and she even scolded my sister in law, when she asked if
She can have the hot water for the kids milk.
I really hope the bird park can be develop better and staff can be more friendly"
,,Why do people scream and shout when a parrot lands on your shoulder?,4.0,,"Roll the bird park ticket in with the zoo and save some money, use a taxi to get to and from the place, easy and less than $20 SGD so really cheap. Covered walkways are hot, some amazing birds, take the time and in a lot of cases a point and click camera that you can fit around the wire mesh to get uninterrupted photos of the birds (DLR camera's want to focus on the wires). This was my 4th or 5th visit, I keep coming back to this place every time I visit. A 20 minute snooze in the taxi from the zoo, allow 3 hours plus."
,,WoW place to have close encounters with variety of birds,5.0,,"Wow place to have close encounters with variety of birds. Firstly go for parrot feeding session where you need to buy honey/nectar for 3$(SGD). Once you have the cup in your hand, parrots will start coming to you to feed on the honey/nectar. But be very careful as some birds are very adamant to get them and they might end up hurting you by holding your arm, shoulders firmly with their claws. Later do not miss the wings of time(Kings of night) where we can see vultures, eagles, hawk show which is worth it. Really a full day place to be visited. Kids will really enjoy this."
,,A bird show you will never forget,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a Singaporean experience you will never forget. The birds come in array of colours, shapes ands sizes. The Birds of Prey show is he best, you will never forget it. Thhe Jurong Bird Park has been going for a long time but visitors never tire of it."
,,Definitely worth a visit but bring a mosquito repellent!,5.0,,"It is a great place to visit for adults and kids. But make sure to bring anti mosquito spray. ( I haven’t had problems with mosquitoes anywhere else I have visited in Singapore apart from Jurong Bird Park, literally got bitten more then 20 times in a space of 15 minutes). If you forgotten one, there is some available to purchase from the gift shops around the park.

The park itself is very pretty, its big enough, and well kept. There were a lot of birds on display that I have never seen before, which was a treat. Be Ready to spend 3-4 hours in the park, to see it all!

I loved the bird show. Visitors can participate in the show, by holding different objects for the birds to fly through or to land on them. ( I got chosen for one of the parts, it was quick but fun! ) If you would like to participate, make sure to sit in the middle aisle (section). There is also a place where you can feed the parrots ( Lorry Loft), which is fantastic experience & great photo opportunity. Feeding the birds at The Loft was definitely my favourite memory of the park!

Ticket for the park is SGD$29, but if you book online there is 10% discount. You can also get ‘Park Hopper’ ticket , which allows you to pick from 4 different parks: Jurong Bird Park, Night Safari, River Safari or Singapore Zoo. Again if you book online there is some sort of discount.
There is a tram that goes around the park, and the tickets are about $5. I personally felt that there was no need for it, even though I bought a ticket and took the tram, I felt like the stops were not well positioned, and that I kept missing parts of the park, so I end up just walking around , which was more enjoyable for me.

To get to the park you will need to get MRT & the bus, and it is quite a long journey. We stayed at Bugis station, and it took us I think just over an hour each way. We got MRT green line to Boon Lay, ones of the MRT, there is a bus Station within the Boon Lay Shopping centre. You can buy tickets for the bus on the bus ( will need exact change) or at the machine. I can’t remember which bus number I got, I just asked at the information point."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,To see so many birds with so much room to fly free was terrific The sight of mouse deer a real bonus I was a little sad to see the Snow Owls in a small enclosure with other birds having so much freedom.
,,absolutely wonderful!,5.0,,"my husband and i are still in awe at how well-maintained the park is. All animals look so healthy, the color of their feathers are magnificent. Each section smells clean and there was enough room for the birds to fly around.

the shows were fantastic. High flyers show was very entertaining but i enjoyed the King of the skies show more. The size of the eagles and vultures they have were glorious. the close relationship of caretakers with the birds was apparent which shows how happy the birds are though they are in captivity. the zoo is equipped with research,breeding and feeding labs.

take the tram ride ($5) to go around the park with ease but make sure to go down at every station and walk around so that you can see the birds up close. There are several benches near the birds' habitats so that you can just enjoy observing them.

bring an umbrella and a bottle of water cause it can get really hot when walking around especially around noon to three in the afternoon.

do consider going early so as to see all the birds and you can spend more time learning about them.

i'd say this is definitely one of the best places to visit for bird lovers. :)"
,,Short and Sweet visit,5.0,,Quite amazing bird show are major attraction. Highly recommended Bird feed. Take about half of the day only.
,,interesting... better go if you have kids along,3.0,,nice place with many different species. a must visit place if you travelling with kids else can give it a miss if you are not a bird lover
,,Feed the penguins!!!,4.0,,My kids (6 and 10 y/o) enjoyed their experience of feeding the penguins. And the long-legged pink flamingos are lovely to look at. And they have breeding station for the birds and bird show which is very informative to the children.
,,Awesome Bird Park,5.0,,You need at least four to five hours to cover the entire area. Make sure go on your own. If you go through guided tour then they hardly give you 1.5 hours which is inadequate. They have trams to take you around and one should take the tram ticket. There are four bird show and one should not miss them. Feeding birds is also something out of the world. Make sure you have good camera and reach park by 10am. Lot of eating joints inside. Do not forget caps or umbrellas.
,,Go straight to the lory loft,4.0,,"Don't bother about any other exhibits, just go straight to the lory loft as the place is worth the entire entrance fee. Get up close and personal with these brazen and bold birds. Buy the feeding cup and wait for a few seconds to be covered in lory. Literally."
,,Relax with the Birds!,5.0,,"It's an experience of a lifetime to come close with the colourful birds. You can feed , touch and feel some of the birds. Children above the age of 6 years will surely love them! Walking through the park gives a relaxing and refreshing feeling. Carry an umbrella as it comes in handy whether it rain or shines!"
,,A lovely afternoon,5.0,,"The show in the amphitheatre was absolutely brilliant, by far the best of all the ones presented in the zoological parks. The birds are in beautiful, very spacious enclosures."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Awesome is the word, should not be missed especially when you are travelling with your family, fun treat"
,,The Bird show is Unbalivable!,4.0,,This attraction is not good for rainy days. Please take your insect wipes with you as I got bit many times! Expect to see many birds that takes you to the time of dinosaurs!
,,Good but not better than KL Bird Park (Malaysia),4.0,,"Before visiting this attraction many of my friends recommended me that this is the best bird park in Asia but i felt it to be just decent . The reasons are as follows
1) lack of interaction with the birds , (malaysia -KL bird park i could interact with most of the birds and even bird feeding was free , here it was charged at 3SG$)
2) most of them are caged
3) very big enough (4/5+ hours minimum to cover the entire bird park if you attend the shows happening on each day)
4) the photo frames are expensive ( 20SG$ minimum)
However the good things are kids are definitely gonna love this place . With kids , one should never miss all the shows happening at the bird park . There are about 10 attractions in the park and on each day atleast 3/4 attractions have shows .
Make sure to reach the bird park as early as 9 am to visit all the shows .
Some shows are exclusively alloted for weekends or particular weekdays

Pricing : We took the 68 SG$ pass ( Bird Park + Zoo + River Cruise + Night Safari) and i would recommend everyone to take this as its cheap
There is a mini VAN kind of vehicle available in the bird park where old people can sit on it and tour the entire bird park without walking . i Guess it was 10 SG$ to use that facility

The bottomline : Irrespective of whether you love birds or not , It is one the must see attractions in Singapore"
,,It's still a good place to visit,5.0,,"Catch the train then bus out to the bird park , it's worth the trip , plus the line goes above ground for a while so there's something to look at . The park itself is very well maintained and the birds are very well looked after , the highlight for my 8 year old ( possibly for the whole trip not just the bird park) was the parrikeet enclosure with all the birds landing on him so they could be fed . The eagle and anaconda show was good as well though clearly tried and tested by all participants ( humans and birds ) . With kids you need to allocate a few hours to get around. Very well worth it ."
,,Bird park - you will remebre for long time,4.0,,"Collection of numerous birds and attractive bird show, you will remember for long time. You will come across one of the highest manmade water fall in this bird park"
,,The largest collection of Birds,5.0,,"Jurong Birdpark is a paradise away from the main attractions of Singapore and i was thrilled to be able to come back and visit this attraction and the condor, owls, penguins and eagles. I was disappointed to see the monorail gone and replaced by trams."
,,Great Place for family and kids,5.0,,"I have been to this place twice in a gap of 6 years. Though not many changes, the place is still great to visit. Kids can really enjoy. The shows are not to be missed."
,,A good place to visit,5.0,,"Yes, its a beautiful place to visit especially if you are with young children,even if not it sure is an experience for a couple of hours.
I'd again suggest to match your timings with the couple of shows they have in certain hours of the day. Its best to visit during the hour,watch a show tour around the vast area and check out the birds and then dine somehwere in the many restaurant options available.
Do wear comfortable shoes as it will take a toll on your feet. You do have the option of choosing the buggy ride but then whats the fun there?"
,,Kids love it,4.0,,Very nice place to go with family. Kids and elders loved it. The bird show is amazing. A must visit. The place is huge with many attractions. Developed a interested in birds in the children.
,,Stunning birds,4.0,,The park is well laid out with train to hop on & hop of if you don't wish to walk but you do need to hop of to see the birds in their aviary's. It was a hot day when we visited which made it a bit uncomfortable but the birds made up for it.
,,Well worth a look,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is an easy way to fill in a half day in Singapore, and well worth the effort. The enclosures are large and the birds seem at ease and healthy and there is certainly plenty to see. There are a couple of shows - again worth a look, and the ""lunch with the Parrots"" was a highlight for us. It was a bit pricey at $25 over the admission ticket, and the buffet lunch that was included was horrible - so bad my wife wouldn't eat, but getting up close and personal to macaws was worth it. Overall it was a great experience. We caught a cab, which again, by Singapore standards was a bit pricey at $26 - largely due to it being peak hour, but I'm sure if you wanted to tackle public transport you could."
,,One Of The Best Collection Of Birds In The World.....!,5.0,,"A must if you love birds, don't miss the shows and take the morning tour and do take a bird guide book along as the collection is huge."
,,Fascinating Asian birds,5.0,,"Bit Toursity but well worth a visit. The Asian bird sections and aviaries are well worth it to see rare species. We liked their awareness of the bird trade, lots of notices making people aware how horrible the human race can be.."
,,Nice Day Out,4.0,,Really interesting place to visit. No lack of birds. A bit humid after 3 hours but well worth a visit
,,"""A bird in the hand!!""",4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park-The park is very good, wonderful number of birds in some beautiful area's. To get there you most likely will need a taxi, we came from Orchard Road, at $17, entry for adults is $29, now it clearly states that pensioners price is $13, however that is only for Singaporean seniors!! but does not state that anywhere. Generally it is certainly worth going, but one word of advice, take your own water/food, trust me!!"
,,Interesting visit,4.0,,"We ventured to the park after a torrential downpour, don't let some of the reviews about the park being a distance away turn you off...public transport in Singapore is so efficient and the whole trip from hotel to park probably didn't take more than an hour....(and there is always something to look at on the way) !! We opted for walking the route of the park (don't waste money on the 'train') which is about 1.5 km and took us about 4 hours after we went in to all the enclosures etc. Some of the cages are on the old side but the staff are very caring and the animals don't seem distressed at all. A lot of signage about the illegal wildlife trade so it was good seeing the park trying to do its best to educate the public. The 'Lorry Loft' was our absolute favourite...coming from Australia we are a bit partial to the lorikeets and these guys were great !! We found a feeding container left by someone (usually $3 SGD) and the teenage son had a great time with the birds following us around !! All up a great day for the family....xxx"
,,Not as good as it was several years back,3.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is not as attractive and good as it was few years back. The Bird shows are more commercial now. The tallest artifical waterfalls fails to make an impression. Have been here in 2001 and 2002. The varities of birds on display and the shows were more realisitc. Even the photos that we take with the birds at the entrance are not appealing.Earlier we were permitted to hold real big colourful birds on our hands and take photos. Now it is like small love birds are made to sit on a holding stand and we have to take photos with them. There are not much takers for this now. Another important aspect noticed was the toilets maintanence. They were not upto the Singapore standards. Very untidy, No tissues in some rooms. And no food available for vegetarians. We and our children had ice cream for lunch as we are pure vegetarians. On the whole was not impressed much with the Jurong Bird Park."
,,A big cage is still a cage!,3.0,,"If you have a healthy heart- ditch the tram! JBP has attractions on either side of a trail-you can thus walk and stop at each attraction, tick it off your map and be done in 3 hours! The tram bypasses lots of the attractions (takes you to key stops)- you would then need to backtrack to cover the rest- which ends up being a pain! You can make it as leisurely or as rushed as you want it.
Still- the lory loft is adorable coz the lories are brilliantly colourfully friendly! The large aviaries are wonderful just because the sight of birds flying uplifts you after the cages! Waterfall aviary is impressively man-made. Penguins are an adorable must see!
It can get hot, very sweaty and dehydrating. Take sunglasses. The gift shop is a joke (stuffed animal toys) (what!?!).
PS. Closest MRT is Boon Lay. Bus 194 from there to park. Cross over to the other side for return bus stop!"
,,An Average Place,3.0,,"Visited Jurong Bird park on 6th April, it was really hot & humid out there, Place was not bad at all but due to hot weather we were not able to explore the place."
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"My family of 4 adults and 2 young kids visited the Jurong Bird Park located in Boon Lay, Singapore. Jurong Bird Park occupies 20.2 hectares (50 acres) of land at the western foot of the Jurong Hill and it has more than 300 species of Birds from all over the world.

One of Jurong Bird Park’s attractions is the Water Fall Aviary which is the second largest walk-in aviary in the world with free flying birds and it houses a 38 metre tall man-made Waterfall which is one of the world’s tallest.

Visitor to the Bird Park has a choice of taking the tramp to maximize the area coverage of the Bird Park or take a stroll to browse the many exhibits. We enjoyed our outing at the Jurong Bird Park. Worth spending a day at the Singapore Jurong Bird Park if you have the time."
,,Away from city,4.0,,it is located far from the city takes nearly and hour by bus to visit there from the MRT. lorry loft is the attraction to visit lots of parrot in there. variety of birds to see there.
,,Massive,5.0,,This place is huge. Took my 2 year old son and we saw less than 50% over three hours. I would love to go back alone with the DLSR.
,,Birds Galore,3.0,,"Some how this attraction slightly miss fired for me. Whilst the massive thunder and lightening coupled with the rain cancelled the afternoon shows, one can't blame this on the park. Staff, very correctly, were concerned for the public's safety around possible lightning strike. Whilst it is always difficult to make enclosures larger enough for high flying birds I feel the enclosures are getting a bit tired. Still a worth while visit with thousands of different birds and the waterfall is impressive enough in it's own right. Children would be enthralled. mention has been made to relocate the park to Mandai along side the other zoos, a good move I feel."
,,Great family day out,4.0,,We loved the bird park. The range of birds in the collection is amazing and the setting is perfect. There are multiple interactive shows and plenty to keep the kids happy. Food options are plentiful and moderately priced. We all agreed that we would happily return to spend a little more time exploring.
,,Take your camera,5.0,,"We went to the Bird Park on a tour, if I go again I would do it as a couple as there is not enough time on the tour.

Lots of colourful bird which you can feed.
We both loved it there even though it rained.
The only problem if it does rain they may not run all the bird shows."
,,South east asias best bird park,4.0,,This world reknown institution shows everything frome bird of paradise to the maybe the worlds best horn bill collection. Mostly you wonder free arround birds and a parrot might land on your shoulder. The noctural house with owls is interesting as are the king penguins in theire big enclosure
,,Fun for children and adults alike,4.0,,"One would think this a place that would only be popular with children but adults have a lot of fun too. Lory feeding, watching the beautiful Pelicans, Flamingos, Parrots. There are unusually interesting places to go to like aviary where birds move around you without being scared. The pretty waterfall is nice too. The bird shows are good, but do note and plan to be there on time. They are punctual and you will miss them if you are far away. Last but not the least buy the bundle from the internet - you get 10% discount and can add tram ride to it."
,,Visit before it relocates.,4.0,,Apparently this park is moving closer to the zoo area later this year so I just hope an established area of greenery has been found for it: today walking through the mature and lush forestry is a delight. Booking through Viator was easy and e tickets were confirmed the following morning - we wanted to visit within 18 hours of the booking. Viator was also much cheaper than other suppliers and used East tours to pick us up and drop us off - $34 for transport entrance and train! The sky rail no longer runs but a mini train does. Shows can be rained off be aware. Overall very pleasant to walk round.
,,"Dull, boring and nothing like photos on their website",2.0,,"We visited this place to get to all activities as per their website, but JBP has nothing except closed enclosures of birds from all over the world. Except the birds there was nothing else to look out for. The whole park can be combed in a hour and travelling 20kms away from the city just for this was not worth. we didn't feel good about this place though. For kids, it could be great though.

Lunch with parrots was a sham when left over food/ordered food was just picked up by birds that flew into a dining hall !"
,,A wonderul family outing,5.0,,A fascinating experience with children. The birds are tamed so well that you keep you smiling all along. Spend atleast 2 hours there.
,,good place other than the zoo,5.0,,other place than the zoo is the birdpark where we can hold the parrots and set the selfie.then have food and enjoy along with the birds
,,Kids and the birds,5.0,,Its a wonderful park with different variety of birds from all over the world. It was quite a rainy day during my visit so I could not enjoy some of the birds. Its a must visit place if you have kids or you are a bird lover.
,,"Not an animal lover, still loved it!",5.0,,"Parrots, Flamingos and owls were the main attractions to me. Do not miss Lory Loft where you can feed the birds yourself. The High Flier show is a must."
,,Very far from the city but its worthed for visit,5.0,,If you bring your kids to Singapore you must visit this place. So many birds there and good attraction also.
,,Certainly one of the best bird parks in the world!,5.0,,"A day away from the bustle of the malls and everyone rushing aimlessly clutching a mobile device - watching the screen instead of where they are going! Jurong Bird Park is the perfect destination for the nature lover.
From the largest waterfall aviary to the immaculately cared for flamingo, pelican, parrot and lory areas, the twittering and chirping with make your heart sing and give your spirit wings on every visit here!
The feedings and shows are certainly worth attending!
The entrance fee is a bit steep, but the facilities and the feathered exhibitionists are worth every dollar!"
,,A day at the bird park,5.0,,Spent all day at this bird park. The shows are all great. The layout is easy to get around and the birds ver accessible. We really enjoyed it.
,,Very good place for children and family too,5.0,,"Don't miss Jurong bird park, its worth to see all birds and some events. Please check the website for the events date and time to plan your trip. Children those more than 3 years will enjoy a lot. Check the promotion also like weekdays or credit card promotion may be cheaper than usual."
,,Amazing Jurong Park,5.0,,How lovely to hear parrot speak like a human. The parrot can even sing. The bird show is great. How I wish I could have interacted with the birds. Flamingo reminds of shows in New York. The women dances with feathers on their back. It is a fun filled activity for the whole family.
,,Lots of fun! Great family outing but HOT!,4.0,,Great place to take the kids but be prepared for the outdoor sweltering heat of Singapore. Take swimmers to cool down at water park toward the end. A great day out and i definitely recommend it.
,,Place for a kids and bird lovers,5.0,,"Kids can enjoy a lot with birds, feed and play with them. Dont miss the bird show here... Birds can do a lot...."
,,2 time,4.0,,"We was here for 6 years ago and our daughter is now in a good age to get a better experience and she was very happy. There is not so much new here, and the family better like the birdpark in KL,"
,,I have no words!!!,5.0,,The jurong bird park in Singapore is an entertaining treat for the entire family.. The bird show is just superb... The bird actually speaks and entertains you with much more!A day aside for this is a must in your itinerary!
,,The shows are good,4.0,,The park is a good place to visit if you are in Singapore. Specially enjoyed the Birds of Prey show . The only thing that you need to be vary of is that it takes some time to get to jurong from most parts of the city. Took us more than 30 mins from MBS
,,Bird display,5.0,,This is the best display of birdlife I have ever seen. I would recommend this as a must for families as there is so much to see as well as a water park to keep the kids cool in this oppressive conditions.
,,Must visit if you like to see birds or have kids with you,5.0,,"This place is just amazing with all its colorful exhibits and very well planned shows which are interactive and educating. If you love birds or if you are traveling with kids then this is a must do attraction.
Go to lory loft and enjoy feeding sessions to birds, this is a must do activity here. The joy you get on seeing those amazing colored birds all over your body is beyond words.
They have some of the rare species of birds kept in a well maintained environment/enclosures.
Be prepared to walk long distances on hilly terrain, but its worth it."
,,Jurong Park for Bird Lovers,5.0,,"Jurong Bird park is a must visit place especially for bird lovers , 
i bought combo tickets Hopper Pass online for Jurong bird Park, Singapore Zoo and night Safari with Tram ride for 88 SGD.

I took train MRT from Bugis to Boonlay MRT Station then i took 194 Bus to Jurong Bird park.I reached Biird park around 8:30 AM and the weather was pleasant , 
i was astonished to see Penguin in the park and bird eggs in incubators and breeding lab and eggs hatching unit.
The park was divided in several zones of varous types of bird , hornbill , flamingos, parrots , pigeons , duckslot more...
 the park is well maintained with natural environment like water falls , lakes small ponds and there was an amphitheater
for performing shows, there was an wal way aviary to feed the birds and small childerns park was there .I took two hrs 
to look around the park by feet
since i went morning it was less crowded and i rounded up quickly as i ve to Scince Centre Singapore and then to Singapore Zoo.

We can also take nice captivating photos with parrots and hornbill birds.
The chirping of birds is heard everwhere in the park and its really a loovely place to spend a day out. 

I came out with the fond memories and the colourful birds  scene in my eyes."
,,Must Visit for Bird Lovers,4.0,,This bird park is an excellent one. You can find different varieties of bird species. There are few shows that you can enjoy. The bird feeding sessions give you a good experience.
,,Enjoyable place for kids,4.0,,Nice place to visit and will take about 3-4 hours to visit the place. There is a bird show at specific times and don't miss it. Kids will have a great time and travelers of all ages will enjoy this place.
,,A must visit!,5.0,,"We recently visited Bird park and it is worth the time! Flamingos, Swan, Toco toucan, all sorts of birds are super amazing to view and click. I simply loved the Penguins. The closest and first time I saw them. Few of them appeared to be statues initially but later moved, few were swimming. A click with Parrots is signature Bird park pic! Could see so many birds that we see in Books.

At one section, the birds are open and you enter big cage kind. Crown Pigeon was roaming freely. In another big enclosure, birds fly and come to you and you can feed them. It is a unique experience in itself. My kid simply loved it.

Its a must visit place for adults, kids, aged people. It is worth the time even if you are not with kids!"
,,Bird lover's paradise!,5.0,,"The huge variety of beautiful birds was wonderful. The bird show featuring colourful Macaws, a cheeky cockatoo and an assortment of other birds is not to be missed. The open avairies were a particular delight - much nicer than than seeing the birds through wire."
,,Good for at least 1 visit,3.0,,We really good time at the birdpark. Like all other attaraction in Singapore - the birdpark is really clean Over all its very nice to visit at least onece if you are in singapore
,,Bird lovers paradise,4.0,,Well run park with large variety of different birds to see. Make sure to see the free shows that are on daily as this allows you to see the birds in action rather than just in cages. We spent 2 hours there but it was a rush visit. You probably need a half day to see all exhibits and shows
,,"Nice area, a little huckstering but overall good",4.0,,"We visited the bird park. They do a good job of displaying many different types of birds with an emphasis on tropical birds (luckliy). Some of the species from more tempeate areas were having trouble with the heat. Otherwise the staff is excellent, friendly and informed. A good day out."
,,Excellent place,5.0,,"I have visited in april,2016 and really good time to experience this place. If you are stay long in Singapore i would recommend to wait for two to three days because for rain to fall after that you ll have beautiful greenery for photography and mother nature love.
There are many attraction points but i loved lory loft, waterfall aviary and birdz of play. The high flyers show and kings of the skies are very well played and managed as well.

Over all its very nice to visit at lease ones if you are in singapore"
,,Not overly impressed,3.0,,"My Fiance and I went to this attraction, because he has been there before and was amazed. The small birds had heaps of space which was great to see. However, the bigger birds including the owls, and the ostriches (which lost most of their feathers due to stress i assume) have small spaces. I am usually opposed Zoo's as it is often a miserable view on animals in too small spaces. I wouldn't go again, as besides the small birds, the other birds barely have any room."
,,Not as good as we expected,4.0,,"A little disappointed by the bird park. We were really looking forward to going and some of the displays were great, for example the flamingos as soon as you walk in were beautiful. Others were a little tired and dirty looking. We did see our first real Toucan which was a highlight of the trip and some of the other birds in the toucan/hornbill section were worth the visit as well. Perhaps coming from Australia where we see the lorikeets and parrots flying free, it just wasn't the same. The large aviaries that you could walk through were well done, and the birds have plenty of space to fly around. We did think it was strange that walking around, we never saw a single keeper or staff member (other than in the cafes of course!)"
,,Cute,4.0,,"Cute park, loved the live bird show ...specially my son enjoyed it a lot and the trip was worth it.. The park is really clean and well maintained. Good attraction"
,,Mesmerizing Birds,5.0,,"This place is great especially if you have kids but even adults can enjoy and more importantly learn a lot about various species of birds. This bird park is on the jurong Island but very easily accessible by taxi and by bus. By taxi it takes 22 Singapore dollars. As you enter you have an opportunity to get close with some birds and take pictures and then you have two options. A ride by tram which takes 20 minutes around the park.There is commentary so one can know what one is seeing. one can stop at each junction and visit the birds before getting on the tram again. The other option is to do the entire stretch by walk which would be my recommendation so one can take some great pictures of the birds up close. so, start your day early incase you are planning to visit this place. In addition, there are two shows-king of skies and birds. both are recommended as its fun to watch. The message of conservation, environment protection was very clear in this park. Must see in Singapore. One can visit this park separately or buy combined tickets for the zoo and the safari and the bird park."
,,An Excellent Weekend Trip,5.0,,"If you have kids this should be the first on your to-do list and even if you are visiting without kids, this place is a must visit for people from all age groups. The park has a big collection of tropical birds and the whole place is a riot of colors, with pink flamingos to bright colored macaws. For a sum, the handlers will allow taking pictures with the macaws as well as feeding some of the birds (you will have to buy bird feeds). Overall, a really enjoyable place."
,,Great with small ones,4.0,,Great day out with little ones (3 & 5)! Enjoyed the birds and specially the mini water park! Thank a lot!
,,Excellent especially if you have kids,5.0,,"I have two kids aged 4 and 7 and trust me it was a great decision going here. the park is big so remember you can spend almost a day here as you certainly do not want to hurry and rush. they have a great map which tells you exaclty what are hte various shows etc so you can plan your day in the park keeping this in mind. also when you buy the zoo ticket, hte tram ride is free so we hopped on this and familiarised ourselves with the entire park first. after this we then got down where we wanted to and saw what we were interested in seeing. we went for the birds of Prey show and that too was very nice and entertaining."
,,A nice place to take kids!,4.0,,"After a busy few days I decided to take my 2 boys here for a nice quiet morning but we ended up staying most of the day! Nice and clean, birds well kept and great sh0ws! great waterfall and great gardens, very pretty"
,,Overpriced but a nice place.,5.0,,I found it a little over priced but the place was nice. I liked it really. If you have kids you should definitely take them there once.
,,Ultimate bird park,5.0,,There are macaws that you can get close to and other birds that fly in the cage where you can get inside. This is as close as you can get with birds. The Emu and Ostriches are aplenty as are the magnificent flamingos. The bird park is must visit for bird lovers.
,,Largest Bird Park in Asia,4.0,,"The park is away for the main city. Unfortunately, the day we visited the park it was raining.So all the birds were hiding & were difficult to locate.They have a few bird show that have specific timings & one should not miss these show. Lot of walking to be done, however there are shuttles available."
,,Outstanding experience!! Must visit place,5.0,,"If you love birds, then this is the place to go. Amazing shows on birds!! Very well maintained place...liked the interactions with parakeet...there couple of them on my shoulder and couple of them on my hat...it was breath taking experience!!"
,,Amazing experience for young children,4.0,,"India
Reached at 10 am...min 3 hours needed..inside it section Lory loft is amazing u can tough birds ,feed them can sit on u ..fantastic to watch white speaking parrots..u can feed penguins....there is also a small pool with slides small kids can njoy,carry swim wear"
,,Really cool!,5.0,,"I included this place in my itinerary instead of the zoo and the night safari because it's very unique (and I'd just been on an actual night safari in Africa a few months earlier) and not something found in just any city. It's a bit of a hike from the city on public transport, but easy enough. I watched the hunting birds show and some of the talking birds, but also really enjoyed the flamingos, parrots, and the feeding area with the waterfall. The pelican area and one flamingo area were in need of maintenance/cleaning, but overall this is a great park."
,,Amazing place,4.0,,"In a very small Park, they have managed a variety of birds and the waterfall and the burden show are not a miss."
,,Glad we visited,4.0,,"This was our second visit to Singapore. We missed the Bird Park last year, so it was high on the list of spots to visit on this year's return.

I understand now why many reviewers suggest that if time is limited, see the Zoo and skip the Bird Park. We did enjoy the Bird Park very much, but it is less extensive than the Zoo. If I was traveling with children and could choose only one site, the Zoo would win.

Having said that, the Bird Park was impressive. We enjoyed The High Flyers show very much. The Bird Park might also be an alternative to the Zoo if time is short. It could easily be thoroughly visited in 4 hours, the zoo takes longer.

It was very interesting to me that several acquaintances in hometown Chicago mentioned enjoying the Bird Park. Their visits were years ago, but the attraction remained impressive in their minds. I can now understand why. I would return."
,,Great for an afternoon visit but that much to see,3.0,,Pleasant park - small but had a tram to take you around with a couple of stops. Birds were interesting and varied. The bird show was shorter than expected but the parrots did some clever tricks.A good afternoon visit but not for a whole day.
,,Top notch experience,5.0,,"You will get to read a lot of good things about the place. Well maintained, informative and entertaining place. Good for all ages.

Tips for visitors:

1. Avoid short clothes as mosquitoes are going to haunt you.
2. Wear comfortable clothes as you need to move around.
3. Reach the place by opening time. They have a couple of events. All are worth watching.
4. There is no MRT station close by. Hard to find a taxi for your return. But many buses ply from this place which connects to the MRT.
5. Just carry a bottle, you can refill it at many places in the park."
,,Unique Experience !,4.0,,"Got an opportunity to visit this park while on a trip to Singapore. It was a truly unique experience to see so many bird species in an open environment, all in one place. Especially enjoyed the interactive nature of most shows and attractions within the park. This is a must see, especially if you have young children in your party. Some tips that might prove helpful :

- The park is quite big so plan a 2-3 hour visit (Will suggest starting in the morning right when the park opens)
- Do not miss the shows - They take place at various locations around the park at specific times so allow yourself enough time to walk/take the tram and get good seats
- Check the weather - Shows may get cancelled if there are heavy showers so check the forecast before you plan your visit (Tickets are expensive so you will want to see as much as possible in one visit)
- Be mindful of the interactive nature of the park. The birds can get quite close to you and may even perch on you in some attractions (Aviary) so be cautious especially if you are bringing along a toddler or baby
- If you have kids in your party, you may want to keep some extra time at hand to splash around the water park before leaving"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Excellent way to spend the day. Visited with in-laws and kids.
Really nice place, clean and plenty of room. All creatures well looked after. Bird show was great.
Tram ride was included in ticket price as we purchased direct from website.
Wet play for the younger kids was great.
Well worth a visit."
,,A paradise for all,5.0,,We had an amazing day getting really close to the most exotic birds. Just a lot of amusing things that keep you entertained. The best part for me (as a bird-watcher) was the brilliant conditions all the birds were kept in. Their environment was as close to the natural habitat as possible. The birds (most of them) were not confined to a small cage which was good. Definitely recommended.
,,So many birds!!!,4.0,,"An excellent park, full of hundreds of birds and animals. The shows were great, exciting and colorful. The animals were healthy and in nice enclosures. Quite easy to see all the animals, including a lot you don't see often, like the different varieties of parrots and toucans. We paid for the bird lunch - the show was good, but the meal was absolutely horrible - food was slow to arrive and not very appetising, there were tables of dirty plates, the staff were rude and inattentive, etc. However, everything else was great, easily spent the day here and would do so again."
,,Jurong Bird Park Over 9000 Species,5.0,,Decided to take a private tour of Jurong Bird park which was well worth a little bit out of the center of Singapore Delighted at the time spent well worth
,,A must Visit while you travel in Singpaore,5.0,,"A must visit place for all age group people. Located near to Boon lay MRT in green line(east west line) . Take 194 bus from bus interchange located down of MRT station. it will drop outside jurong bird park.I recommend at least to spend 4 hours in the park and one should try to go early in the morning to avoid the sun. ( park opening time is 8.30 AM)

Park is not that big but Plenty of wide variety of birds. Both the shows The High Flyers(11 am, 3 pm) and the Kings of the Skies (10 am, 4 pm) are must watch. Even the bird feeding event is very good experience.

Single adult entry ticket is 26 SGD but If you are planning a Zoo visit or wildlife safari then buying a four park pass might be the way to go as the individual ticket prices are significantly cheaper when buying a multi park pass.(approx 62 SGD , 4 parks).

The tram is useful to get an overview of the park or take a break from walking for a while. Shuttle service will drop you to Pioneer MRT while leaving.
Recommended for anyone who visit Singapore for few days."
,,Lots of birds!,4.0,,We liked the bird park. We took the MRT to get there. Lots to see with quite a bit of variety. Put on the bug spray and bring a hat and a couple of bottles of water.
,,Lovely activity for small children,5.0,,A lovely place for small kids. Would defiantly go again. Surprises around every corner. Go as early as possible to avoid the crowds.
,,Birds,4.0,,This is a very good bird park not big but lots of birds.A very well designed and maintained park.Lots of people but worth the visit.
,,A bird lover's paradise.,5.0,,"The Macaws that invite you are just a teaser. Then you encounter well trained birds of prey and all sizes of them, The show was dramatic as awe inspiring. The different birds show from amcaws to parrots to flamingoes and pelicans and toucans and hornbills are well trained and show off their skill with perfect strangers from the audience. The tram ride is good for short time travellers who pack a lot into their day. otherwise walking around makes the experience good. The lorys and the Waterfall 100ft high are a must see. just dont miss it."
,,"Enjoyed the Bird Park but not ""Lunch with the Parrots""",4.0,,"We caught the MRT to Boon Lay MRT Station and then the No. 194 bus from the interchange bus station adjacent to the MRT and mall. It is very easy to spot the Bird Park and know when to get off the bus because nearly everyone will be alighting there.

We saw both shows, the High Flyers and the Kings of the Skies. We thought that the presentation was excellent and it was mindboggling to think of how many hours must have gone into training the birds to achieve such feats.

After the shows we visited the penguins at feeding time and for $2.00 I was able to purchase some small fish to throw to them.

We found the tram very useful for getting around as the terrain is quite hilly and the weather was very hot and humid. The frequency of the tram was very good.

After the shows we attended Lunch with the Parrots ($25.00 p.p.) which I booked online prior to our visit to Singapore. This, unfortunately, was a disappointment. It was very poorly organised and the service and quality of the food was mediocre.

We arrived at the restaurant exactly on time, and the sign at the entrance said ""Wait to Be Seated"", however after quite some time waiting, no-one showed any interest in us so we made our way through all the tables of people already eating from the buffet. When we asked at the counter what should we do, the waiter nonchalantly replied ""sit at any of the tables with a 'Reserved' sign on them"". The waiters in general didn't seem to be doing anything other than standing around or wandering around aimlessly. No-one appeared to be giving any direction and my daughter saw two waiters flicking something at each other and laughing.

The food selection was very limited and poor in quality. There was no water and the only other drink apart from tea and coffee was orange cordial. I was somewhat heartened when I found out there was ice cream, however someone had left the lid open and it was melted.

The bird show was entertaining and the presenters were personable and did a good job.

I would visit the Bird Park again, however I definitely wouldn't do ""Lunch with the Parrots"" again."
,,Bird Park,1.0,,"Needlessly, outrageously expensive. Ok, I paid $80 online which is a bit cheaper, for 3 adults. Considering it is Singapore, that is par for the course I guess. But paying $60 in the Bongo Restaurant for an order of chicken nuggets, 2 orders of chicken wings and 3 ice filled drinks is over the top. Seriously, $20 fast food burger meals? Typical Singapore gouging."
,,Ignore the map!,1.0,,"Not having been here for more than thirty years, we really wanted to revisit the birds. Using the Singapore Concierge Map as a guide, we dutifully took the long ride to the end of the line, AS SUGGESTED ON THE MAP. The problem is that you can't get there from there. Attempts to take taxis were futile."
,,Great Fun!!!,5.0,,"Watched the bird flight show - great fun.
Pay extra for the tram ride. It makes it easier to get around. Take plenty of water and a hat, you'll need it in Singapore's hot and humid climate. The water fall in the free flight aviary is a nice place to cool off.
Well worth the visit."
,,Enormous Collection of Birds,4.0,,"The Jurong Bird park is a must see for lovers of the feathered wildlife. There is an enormous collection of birds that come from all over the globe, my favourites include the hornbills and birds of prey. There were a couple of shows held throughout the day where you can watch the birds flying and performing for the crowds.

There is plenty to see and do, the attraction is reasonably priced, however you should think about what you want to see and visit when in Singapore as there are big discounts on multi park ticket purchases. If you are planning a Zoo visit or wildlife safari then buying a four park pass might be the way to go as the individual ticket prices are significantly cheaper when buying a multi park pass.

The bird park is child friendly and we saw many local and international families having a wonderful time, I would recommend this attraction to anyone who has a few days to spend in Singapore."
,,Bird World Species,4.0,,"Well maintained park , it contains majorly all world species and afternoon show is a treat to watch.Take MRT and then bus to Bird Park"
,,"Awesome experience at the start, and then very boring",4.0,,"Well it's surely an experience. We all were very excited at the start, and the bird show is surely a great watch.
But after a bit your get tired of seeing buyers in cages.
We went there for the kids, who got tired very quickly and then it was quite a drag.
A great place to tick the box, but not for long stays."
,,A great day out,5.0,,"A great day out for adults and kids alike. Easy to get to via MRT and bus. Reasonably priced considering the size of the park, though the food outlets are a bit exorbitant. The tram is useful to get an overview of the park or take a break from walking for a while. There can be a queue for the tram at the main station, but from the waterfall station it is was very quiet. Some of the birds are in cages, but there are still plenty of great photo opportunities. The Kings of the Sky show is highly recommended."
,,Good for Children,2.0,,"Ok, not so good and not so bad, two shows everyday morning are very good. Artificial water fall is good."
,,Great family day out,5.0,,"This was on my bucket list and was so glad I got to experience it - after reading a few negative reviews I was a bit hesitant but it is a fabulous place. Lots of walking and it was very hot but well worth it. The staff are so friendly and very knowledgeable.
Getting up close with the birds in the aviaries was great. Great photo opportunities.

The man-made waterfall was great, perfect location for pics. We walked from here back to the end location allowing us to see more things we would have missed by taking the tram, only a 15-minute easy walk and well worth it.

Worthy of a visit if you love birds, kids will just enjoy themselves here as well as us big kids. The highlight for me though was seeing the amazing pink flamingo's - they were just breathtaking."
,,the best,5.0,,"the best ever day out lots to do lots to see. good value exciting day.Great staff help you all the way go beyond what they need to do,great people"
,,Lovely,3.0,,We went to jurong bird park during our family vacation...and it's a very charming beautiful place to spend a day! Yes it took us an entire day to see the park but it was worth it...they have the whole place done upbeat tidily with lovely migratory birds and have a wonderful bird show which was very exciting for my four year old daughter...carry some air fans as it tends to get very warm but this place is a must visit!
,,Family Trip,3.0,,If you are bird lover then you need one complete day to visit Jurong Bird Park. There are 2 live shows which are worth watching and man made tallest waterfall. If you have enough time please visit
,,Nice day out,4.0,,My husband visited this park 30 years ago and always had fond memories. We used the MRT to get there which was so easy. It is a lovely park well maintained and quiet inexpensive to enter. Great for families or anyone that likes the outdoors. Well worth the trip.
,,Most exotic place I've visited,5.0,,Great visit - open air park with birds all around. Paid for tour - guide was wonderful and knowledgeable re bird lore & habitat as well as stories about how birds bond with keepers. Grace (her name) was very helpful with picture taking too. Parents should instruct children not to chase or harass or scream around the birds as they will harm future interaction with other visitors.
,,Superbirds,5.0,,"On an organised tour, your coach guide takes you around the park partly on foot, partly by tram. This is most informative, but can feel rushed. It is some way from the city if you want to stay longer and make your own way back. Apparently the Bird Park is moving to near the zoo next year or year after, so you can probably visit the bird park, zoo and Night Safari all in one excursion."
,,Great for kids,4.0,,The park presents especially the kids with great shows and adventures. The highlight of the day must be feeding the Lori.
,,Lots of Birds,4.0,,"If you are a bird lover - you will enjoy this. While some of the exhibits are not very exciting, it was great to be able to see toucans and hornbills. Is hard to take photos as there are a lot of cages and bars in the way, but great to view."
,,Day spent amongst Birds,4.0,,"Can see about 5000 birds of 400 species.High Flyers Show brings largest collection of birds together for a spectacular show. Birds are trained to pick currency from the hands of volunteers and bring them back later. They are made to compete and play games. Made to go through the rings of different sizes.

If you love birds, this is the place you have to be."
,,Must Visit for all age groups,5.0,,"Try to reach in the morning so that you have full day with you. Carry some eatables to avoid buying expensive meals at the venue. Water fountains are available hence getting portable water is not a problem.
The bird show is excellent and should not be missed.Take the tram initially to get a feel of which birds are situated at which place in the park and later by walk have a closer look."
,,Jurong Bird Park is indeed good!,4.0,,"Very good varieties of birds from the very little ones to the monster scavengers. The amphitheater bird show was awesome as was the big birds show at the Hawk arena. The way these guys have trained the birds to do the things they say is truly remarkable. There is a tram service available inside the park which will take you for a ride inside the park if you don't want to walk all the way inside the park.

Make sure Jurong Bird park is in your 'to-do list' if you intend to visit Singapore"
,,Great birds to see in good surroundings,5.0,,If you want to see birds in as near the wild as you are likely to then Jurong is a the place to visit. In particular the pink flamingos are worth the visit all on their own but there's lots more to see besides.
,,Eye popping bird displays will enthral you.,4.0,,"A short MRT & bus ride gets you to the Jurong Bird Park and once there you will not be disappointed and I'm speaking for three adults....kids will love it.
The park is well laid out and a regular land train traverses you up some steep hills (we went on a VERY hot day, so it was a god send).
Must sees are the wide ranging bird display in the auditorium, the parrot area and the cages of huge predators.
Food on offer was not great, so either bring you own or eat before/after."
,,Great for bird lovers,4.0,,"Can't understand why so many people don't think much of this attraction. It is exactly what you would expect, a lot of different birds in a park!
There are the usual sorts of shows and displays, and a tram to get you up the hill gw the heat of the day (although this does cost extra on admission). The larger aviaries are impressive, some of tho smaller cages seem a little cramped, notably the penguins as the first attraction you see, but all in all the birds seem content.
They advertise the conservation work they do, which makes tho visit all tho more worthwhile. A trek out of the city, we went with Uber and it was $20 from Marina Bay aon 20 mins. Then bus and mrt back took around an hour."
,,Lovely place to spend the time with birds,4.0,,"Ultimate destination for bird lovers. Use feedings to view the birds closely. Can either take the tram or use walk trail if want to spend more time with the birds. Do watch the birds show, it is just amazing."
,,Awesome experience,4.0,,"It was awesome experience. Dont miss Lorry Loft. you can feed the birds . Its better to go around 9 AM , it will be less crowded. Even birds will be hungry and they come and sit on your hands , head. After 12 PM , birds start hiding and even it will be crowded. Dont miss the shows. They are fabulous"
,,A wonderful bird attraction,5.0,,"At the recommendation of my sister I visited the Jurong Bird Park today and very much enjoyed my visit. Much like Singapore Zoo, there is a tram/shuttle on-site with several stopping points around the park, and as the site is located on a hilly area it's worth catching. I wished they'd had extra stops with this service mind you, a number of their attractions you just drive by and miss, so you must walk back to if you have time, or forego if on tour, such a pity.

Getting up close with the birds in some aviaries was quite cool, allows for some lovely photographs to be shot. The park has a few photo opportunities that you can purchase if you desire.

The man-made waterfall was great, perfect location for a snap. I took a walk from here back to the end location allowing me to see a few extra birds I would have missed by purely catching the tram, only a 15 minute easy walk and well worth it. The visit was ended with a 30-minute bird show with many impressive bird flying in and on those willing to volunteer.

Worthy of a visit if you love birds, kids will just enjoy themselves so much here I'm sure."
,,A wholesome experience at one of the world's best bird parks,5.0,,"The bird park is very well maintained and has some exciting bird shows and bird feeding sessions. Tip - don't forget to ask for the map of the bird park to visit all the areas and explore the bird park to the fullest. the Bird park has a vast expanse and can take anywhere between 3 - 4 hours to see the whole park - so keep sufficient time at hand, especially if you enjoy bird watching!"
,,Great place!!,5.0,,"We had a wonderful time here. The birds are amazing. Try to catch the feedings to see the animals up close. We bought the nectar to feed the birds and one took a serious liking to my husband and wouldn't leave him. SO funny, even left a little remembrance of himself. They had a sink with soap to clean up though. Top rate place!!"
,,We love birds,4.0,,"We stayed at the Marriotts for four nights, tired of the daily Orchard road environmemt, we took a cab and spend six hours in Jurong Bird Park.
Great places with lots of rest places with celing fans along the long sunny and humid walks around the different birds species locations.
One remark I have , at the last nightbirds (Awls) dark and airconditioned place at the entrance it said : please be quite, do not take pictures and or your flashes as it hurt the awls eyes...guess what..a bunch of noisy locals walks in with kids shouting non stops, they took loads of pictures with flash..so noisy and ignorant those peoples are.
So suggestion: have a security guy there at all time to stop those ignorant peoples hurting your sensitive birds.
Otherwise great adventure for a day trip."
,,Best value with Parkhopper,5.0,,"If you plan to visit Jurong Bird Park along with any of the parks at the Singapore Zoo area, check their website first. They have excellent deals that includes discounts and freebies.

The birds are very healthy and the bird shows featuring the raptors are worth waiting for.

Also, like the Singapore Zoo, the cafeteria is quite good and prices are reasonable unlike in other themed attractions.

You can get here via MRT via Boon Lay but you still need to change to a bus (251). If you're with kids, it's best to get a taxi or Uber from the city center."
,,Good variety of birds to watch,3.0,,We had a close view of some birds. Must visit for bird watchers. The shows are good. Not very crowded.
,,One places to see birds for all parts of world,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is an ultimate destination for Bird lovers, its One places to see birds for all parts of world. It was lovely walking round the bird park and the bird seemed well cared, happy and freedom\n It has variety of Birds inclusive of some of the most exotic birds from tropical forests. This garden has over 8000 birds and 600 different species of birds in this park"
,,Truly Exotic Paradise!!,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is an ultimate destination for Bird lovers. It has variety of Birds inclusive of some of the most exotic birds from tropical forests. The Aviary is very well kept. it's a full day excursion thru the park and don't miss the bird shows.
Children will love this place and adults too... A must visit place!!!"
,,Must come!,5.0,,"It was lovely walking round the bird park and the bird seemed well cared, happy and freedom.. the bird show was good and fun. It is a huge place and you need spend a day to complete the entire park.."
,,Bird Watchers Delight,5.0,,This garden has over 8000 birds and 600 different species of birds in this park. One of the popular and most frequented attractions in Singapore.
,,Juran Park... kingdom of Birds,5.0,,"Want to see in one place all the birds, then Jurang Bird Park is the place, Kids , teens or adults everyone will enjoy here. Dont miss the bird shows especially the flamingo shows. Has vast variety of birds to see, plan your time inside properly.

The bird park is little away from City , the trains are best way to go there and then catch a bus to go to the park. The food and other stuffs expensive inside. Take the pass for all 4 parks ( Bird park, zoo , Night safari and river safari), you will save."
,,Nice for tourist attraction,3.0,,It a nice experence for a tourist to visit singapore. Can have close view of the bird and interative with the birds during the show.
,,Awesome - Good for bird watchers,5.0,,"Spent a day at the park with my 6 YO & wife. Awesome collection of birds.

Bird shows are not to be missed. Amazed at what they can get a bird to do.

MCaws were huge n scary but with beautiful colors.
love to do it again."
,,Birds of paradise,4.0,,This place has a huge collection of birds in captivity but they are very well taken care of. Visit on foot and don't miss the regular bird shows.
,,Beautiful Aviary,4.0,,"With uncountable exotic birds from all over the world, this park offers hours of enjoyment. However, I tried to get a taxi back to the apartment and discovered that, due to some problems with migrant workers in the Jurong area, taxis won't pick people up there. Fortunately, a man driving a video delivery van gave me a ride back and even offered me some of his lunch! He refused to take any payment."
,,ADULT AND KIDS ALIKE,5.0,,We had a full day to waste and we decided to try park. and what a decision it was. The park is full of wonder left and right. Just get some seeds and wait for the birds to come to you. This park needed a good 3-4 hours to enjoy the whole thing.
,,Amazing shows of birds,5.0,,The shows are the major attraction of this park. Must not miss any shows. Kids to elders will all enjoy it.
,,Beautiful Bird Park,5.0,,Good visit along with the family and nice time watching different shows and feeding time activities. This is a must for all the Singapore Tourist.
,,Birdy,5.0,,This was the best attraction i had in Singapore and specially the show not to miss any. Its a must go and experience it.
,,Not as good as I remember,3.0,,"Last visited around 2002 when they had a monorail taking you into the park. I felt it lacked something and we did not feel there were as many birds in the huge aviary as we remembered . Those making a first-time visit will probably enjoy it, though."
,,Fantastic place for everyone. Be amazed with the life of birds,5.0,,"We recently visited Jurong Bird Park for the eighth time, we just love it there.
Jurong Bird Park has improved since our previous visit. It is a great place to take the children, or anyone, for an insight into the lives of birds.
The Lory Loft has bright colourful exotic birds that will sit on your arm eating their nectar food. Up so close, you just can't get that every day!
The Bird of Prey show is one of the greatest bird shows in the world. Don't miss the free flying parrots either.
The other highlight is the baby bird rooms and incubation centre, it is fantastic to see nature up close. It is so clean and just nice being there, like a baby human nursery.
Thank you Jurong Bird Park people for having such a fabulous place, keep up the good work and we will see you soon! Just a bit less vegetation so we can see the birds easier please."
,,Nice Place to Chill and spend a day with your loved ones.,4.0,,Nice Place to Chill and spend a day with your loved ones. Look for the place you can get to feed the birds. Bring your own camera.
,,Good park but over rated..,3.0,,"There is a smaller than expected collection of birds..

this makes it a bit slack so while it is great but lets not over rate it...

the idea is definitely unique and must be promoted

the last segment of play inwater should be promoted to inform travellers beforehand to bring in swim suits for kids..the store selling stuff is pretty expensive."
,,Interesting and varied range of bird life,4.0,,"Loved the show - the parrot was especially clever with his counting and singing abilities in different languages. Catch the tram to stop 2, as the walk is quite steep (thanks to our lovely guide for that tip) and the humidity will make it more miserable. Even if you're not in love with birds, it's a good place to visit and spend some time."
,,average,3.0,,this place has great variety of birds and you also get an opportunity to feed them and take pictures too. but it also gets quiet boring after few hours. if you dont have anything to do for half day then you can visit this place. if you skip it too then also no harm.
,,Fabulous bird park with good free flying areas,5.0,,"We spent an afternoon here and really enjoyed it
The park has a huge number of our feathered friends of all different shapes, sizes and colours
The park has different themed areas and large free flying open areas where you can watch the birds in a very natural environment"
,,Great variety of Birds,4.0,,Park has extensive species of birds covering the globe. The bird shows add the extra entertainment to the whole package. Minimum time required 60-90 mins to cover the park.
,,Unique Idea!,5.0,,"A place that every member of a family enjoys. Children enjoy it best. The tram service inside makes the walk easy. The tram has three stops. Once you pay for the tram, you can avail it as many times as you wish. The bird show at four PM is the highest enjoyment. We get all the prominent bird variety. The birds get enough space and are happy to be there except the great Hornbill perhaps. The Waterfall aviary is an exciting place where the birds are very nearer to you ."

,,Don't miss the shows!,5.0,,"If you live in Singapore - go for the annual pass in the same price as a single tickets. It's worth it - the place calms you down, with all the amazing birds and information it has to offer. For sure, the highlights are the shows - don't miss them! And for kids - feeding the birds. It gets crowded during public holidays, so you might get pretty annoyed. Apart from this, the park provide the free shuttle to the neared metro station."
,,Great family outing,5.0,,Great place to watch and get close to all feathers animals. An enriching experience about different types of birds. Worthwhile visit. Been there many times.
,,Great Birdpark,5.0,,"We make point of visiting bird parks when we travel and this one was well worth the effort. Well laid out and maintained, easy to get around and a wide range of birds in big aviaries. Recommended"
,,The beautiful bird exhibit,4.0,,"Despite being a day of mammoth proportions heat and humidity wise, we still enjoyed our visit to Jurong Bird Park, although we did shorten the length of our visit. We caught a taxi out there, surprisingly the taxis in Singapore are very reasonable ($25 for a one way trip for four of us, would have added and extra $100 if it had been Sydney !) but all worth the trip. The penguin sanctuary is a pleasant surprise, the flamingos beautiful, but the parrots were just breathtaking. Family facilities for young children with lots of water features, but make sure you cover yourself up well, it was hot !!! Perhaps the wrong day to go? Despite all that, those parrots and their colours were worth it all."
,,Jurong bird park.. Near BOONLAY MRT,5.0,,We took bus no 194 from BOONLAY MRT station... direct to jurong bird park.. we visited the place on 4th march 2016 before check in cruise on harbourfront.. we reached jurong by 8 in morning to watch most unimagined show kings of the sky.... @10 a.m. must must watch... it also done in evening @4. We tried tram to watch all the jurong... because we were 6 pax with 4 senior citizen.. please take a walk ride to look the park .. it is really beautiful.. I liked bird research development area a lot.. and also children park located in park... they are researching on each bird and taking superb care of all birds... we never seen these much types of birds before... the second show @11 is also must for parrot lovers... singing parrot can be seen in these show.. panguine area was superb too.. food available... soveniours also available in jurong... we check out @1 to reach harbourfront MRT to take cruise.. super class experience.
,,Visit this place if you love Birds.,5.0,,"You will find birds, Birds & birds of all feathers except the ANGRY BIRDS. There is a toy train which moves arround and stops at stations within the park. Its a zoo of birds."
,,well worth a visit,5.0,,this was one of the main highlights of our holiday.Its an amazing attraction and the shows are seen to be believed.I have never seen so many beautiful birds you could easily spend the day there.
,,An oasis of peace,4.0,,"A place for young and old , where everyone will feel good . From subway station is about 10 minutes go by bus , but the distance is big enough . To reserve at least 2 hours for this park and have the battery charged in camera. For cost , can buy food for parrots to feeding ."
,,Birds of a feather ...,5.0,,"Ten years ago, on our last visit to Singapore, I was bowled over by the wonderful experience of feeding the brightly coloured lorikeets in the Lory Loft - so we simply had to go back and do it all over again! To be honest, these birds are not overly shy, and it's possible to get close to them even without holding a cup of nectar, but it's quite something when they actually hop onto your hand. One bird near the entrance to the aviary was quite keen on pecking at our heels too!

The staff will take photos of you with the lorikeets but be aware that these are $20 each to buy; photos with the macaws and cockatoos at the entrance to the bird park are $25 each.

We also enjoyed watching one of the hornbills being shown off and fed what I think must have been mealworms.

Another place to get very close to all sorts of birds is the Waterfall Aviary, where you can not only rest and have a snack - they sell pots of fruit which are very refreshing on a hot day - but take photos of superb starlings and the spectacular crowned pigeon (which doesn't much resemble the pigeons we know back in the UK but is much more glamorous).

We also saw the cassowaries with their bizarre and fantastic casques, and even spotted some green iguanas making their way around the grounds.

Definitely a day well spent and easily accessed from the MRT system and then by the connecting 194 bus which drops you right outside.

Entrance is $28 but it's a pity that the reduced entry fee of $12 for senior citizens only applies to Singaporeans, so that us oldies from other parts of the world who have made the journey have to pay full price ..."
,,Back again,4.0,,"Came back here again today after a break of maybe 6 months or so. The annual pass for the same price as a one-day ticket makes it quite an attractive choice with young children, although seeing the same regular shows time after time can get a little dull."
,,A day well spent,4.0,,We decided to venture out one of the famous Singapore attraction. This place has some rare species of birds like vultures and few others. The park visit is a little pricey but you can easily spend the entire day. There are few bird shows as well and the waterfall is good
,,A must for anyone who likes Birds,5.0,,"I thouroughly enjoyed ""the Bird Park"". We were there in November. Singapore is very hot, being right on the equator. So get anywhere outdoors early. Really enjoyed ""the Macaus"" Lorikeets and Bird show."
,,Only for bird lovers,4.0,,"Fantastic place for bird lovers. But if you are not, I do not suggest. Little bit far off from the city"
,,The colourful and intelligent world of Birds,5.0,,"As a bird lover I was very excited to visit this park. It certainly did not disappoint. An amazing number of all types of birds from around the world. Well cared for and looked after by their keepers. Plenty of room for flying and roaming. Even my non bird loving friends loved this attraction. I could have spent all day but had to leave around 2. Get there at 830 when birds are active or early evening. The two shows we saw were highlights. Birds of Prey show giant bald eagles, vultures, condors, kites, owls and a cheeky kingfisher who kept stealing their treats. Simply amazing how well trained these free flying carnivores were. Soaring directly over the audience it made me cry with joy! The High Flying show was for the waterbirds (comic relief) and the super smart parrots. Macaws, toucans, our Aussie cockatoo, hornbills, amazons etc. showing off their intelligence and flying skills. All the birds were simply mimicking their natural foraging, flying skills nothing that any of them would be uncomfortable. I really liked that the birds were not used as play toys for the public and not handled by anyone but their keepers. All ages would love this park."
,,Great family friendly location,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a great place for family gathering and have fun. There free tram service with 3 stops that bring you to parrot feeding and the man made waterfall.

The parrot feeding is a must try and you cn buy the food for feed at S$3 per cut and all the parrots small nd medium size ones will start to come to you. Get ready your camera!

The man made waterfall is nice photo taking location with birds flying freely inside the enclosure. However there are mosquitoes, prepare insect repellent.

If you are bringing you kids, bring along swiming suits for them, the waterpark is quite nice for the kids to run around and have fun. There are lifeguard to ensure kids are having fun safely."
,,Wowwwwww !!!!,5.0,,This place is one of my favourite. I was not in a mood to exit this place. So much to see and absord. I have not seen such a vast variety of birds at one place. Colorful and Exotic. Birds carrying out so many activities was highly memorable. Still cherish the moments :-):-):-):-)
,,Great.,5.0,,"Booked park hopper packace via Singapore Zoo website and Jurong Bird Park was the first. Great place with beautiful birds, worth to visit for everyone who loves wildlife."
,,Thousands of Birds,4.0,,Large collection of birds although some of the older structures seem small and the birds seem stressed. Both the entry fee and food concessions are expensive. Would we return? Probably not.
,,Extraordinary Bird Part!,5.0,,"What a fabulous place!
You will spend a fabulous half or full day seeing all the wonderful birds - from all over the world.
The bird shows are amazing. Birds of pray - impressive and then the colourful tropical birds, one an even sing!
Kids and adults will love it alike! A must do in Singapore!"
,,Great for interactivity with children,4.0,,"You can easily reach the Bird park on the MRT and then on Bus 194 direct to the park. The park is huge and requires a good part of a day to visit and enjoy properly. There are enclosed open flying cages, demonstrations at various times, and birds in closed areas.
The one with most interactivity is the area wit the wooden suspension walkways where you can feed the small parrots and have 5 , 6 or more fly to you. We watched as one parrot tried to unwind an elastic hair band on a young girl as her family watched taking photos.
Along the path, we watched a lizard eat foliage from a plant alongside the trail.
You do need time to visit here and enjoy the sites."
,,A bird in the hand.........,5.0,,Obviously we prefer to see birds in their natural habitat but this was the next best thing. Very well laid out and signposted. We walked but their is a train for children or people with mobility problems. The Owls were my favourite. The open aviary was really large and great to be so close (on your hand) to the parrots.Good displays throughout the day for all the family ie penguin feeding. Really enjoyed the nursery too seeing the recently hatched chicks. An excellent day out for all the family and very accessible by public transport.
,,birds zoo,4.0,,"variety of birds are all at one place, half day is enough to cover everything.carry hat/cap as need to walk under sun for 3-4 hours"
,,Relaxing experience,4.0,,"Easily accessible by public transport. Beautiful place to walk around, the hornbill collection is especially strong. If you're planning on watching the bird show, I recommend insect repellent."
,,Not like the other zoos,2.0,,"Big disappointment! If you've been in the Kuala Lumpur bird park don't even bother to come here. It's far from the city and less fun! The birds are kept in relative small and crowded cages contrary the other zoos in Singapore. We saw birds trying to fly but were immediately hit themselves on the roof, couldn't even fully stretch their wings in the process. The park itself is big, has a lot breeds a parrot aviary where you can feed lories and a waterfall aviary where some birds can fly freely. But it's a pain to see the others in the little cages. It should be like in KL where a huge park is covered with net and all the birds are free to fly. If you haven't been in the KL Bird Park and have a half day for it, then maybe you can visit it. Otherwise it isn’t really recommended."
,,The zoos poor relation,3.0,,"We visited as we bought the combined ticket from the zoo, although interestingly it's practically Empty here in comparison. Also had we realised the effort it takes to get here we wouldn't have bothered. It's 1 mile from the nearest mrt across very busy roads so we got a taxi for $6 there but getting back we had to ring for one (God know how much that cost me) as they don't stop there and this added $2 to a $10 taxi fare as it was rush hour going back. Some bird displays were great and felt like they were at home but others were in very small cages."
,,Great bird show,4.0,,"Easy travel by train and bus. Need to cross the other side of the road for the return bus trip but not clearly signed. Good variety of birds and great live show with all forms of parrots and others. Missed the show with the Hawks due to rain. Great way to see the park is from the open bus and get off and back on at main stops. Or do as I did with a full circuit on the bus that also gave commentary of all the exhibits, then walked around to have a better look at my own pace."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"Love the bird shows, feeding the Penguins, tram ride, Lord loft, waterfall aviary, research centre..overall lovely day to spend"
,,Great place to see beautiful birds from all around the world !!,5.0,,"Jurong Bird park is a beautiful place, for people from all age to visit, it has Macaws, flamingos, egrets, swans, duck, parrots and beautiful birds in open and some in enclosures and cages too ... : ("
,,Worth a trip even for an Aussie...,4.0,,Although there are lots of Australian birds there that we are fortunate to have in our back yards. The park was a lovely restful place and if I was a bird I wouldn't mind living there at all!
,,Great variety,5.0,,Lots of varieties of birds - plus all creatures great and small. Good fun. My favourite has to be the birds of Paradise. Wonderful enclosures to walk through.
,,Lots of fun,4.0,,"The bird park is a fun place for all. There is a huge collection of birds. Visitors even get to interact with the birds which are in the open. Visitors have the option of feeding the birds and at that point they come and sit on top of you. Various birds right from flightless birds like penguins to Eagles and Vultures are present. There are different shows in the park and the high fliers being the best.

Children will have a lot of fun there"
,,great birds and lovely setting,4.0,,"An easy taxi ride from downtown, the birdpark is a peaceful oasis. A nice selection of birds most in pleasant surroundings. At selected times there are outdoor shows which are relatively short and fun with some useful facts on the birds. The best way to visit the park is to walk around, but the heat and humidity of Singapore can make that a bit tiring. Be sure to bring a hat and hydrate."
,,Great Place,5.0,,"We spend full day at bird park, it has a very beautiful man made water fall which is close to 100 mtr tall. It has got very wide variety of birds species, specially I like the dark world section which has owls."
,,Colourful park !!,3.0,,"A peaceful and enjoyable place to visit with nicely maintained park surroundings.
The setting is nice, dream place for photographers. It would roughly take 3-4 hours to visit the entire park.
There is tram as well which drops you to different station and from where you can visit all birds etc. But prepared to walk a little.
Lots of hornbills around."
,,Quite an attraction,5.0,,This is a place to visit in Singapore. This takes a day to go round comfortably. It has few shows which happen at a fixed time starting from 10am to 11.30 am. You get to witness some amazing birds so well taken care there. You also have carts to take you around if you need assistance and also the baby strollers are available on rent. we had around 3 hours of time so could not cover complete park.
,,Great range of birds you have probably never seen,5.0,,"A bit of a taxi ride from town, but worth it if you like birds. Huge range of toucans and hornbill type birds, parrots, etc. The shows were also quite good. The place is very clean and the birds all appear to have good facilities and be well looked after. It was almost empty while we were there which was surprising but it was wet season during the week."
,,Pricy!,2.0,,"This is a very expensive venue and was not for us. There will be those that disagree and say the upkeep of all the birds will justify the admittance fee. Maybe so, but not for me."
,,"Obviously good if you like birds,",4.0,,A peaceful and enjoyable place to visit with a good bird show and nicely maintained park surroundings - some transport available to get around but be prepared for a walk.
,,Amazing Array of Asian Pheasants!!,5.0,,"Absolutely loved this park! Bring an umbrella, bug spray and water! Expect to spend 3 hours. Had never seen such a variety of Hornbills and Pheasants/Doves in one place."
,,BIRD PARK,5.0,,I love going here again and again... This is one of the worlds best bird park where you will find varieties of birds including some animals too... The highlight of this park are the various shows throughout the day which should not be missed. The best thing i enjoy the most is feeding the birds with your own hands.
,,Lots to walk.,3.0,,The shows are good but the park is vast and has lots to walk. The collection of birds is nice though.
,,so much bird to see that it is so excitiing to go again and again,4.0,,"as I got so happy and fun and love the nature of the birdpark which is colourful and so much bird to see, keep come back and worth to get the yearly pass for multiple visit in the year. many shows to see and nature and the waterfall area also so cooling if get too warm."
,,Some fascinating displays,4.0,,"The park is easy to get around, thanks to their trams, and displays are very good. The penguins are very interested and the waterfall is quite impressive."
,,Birds Galore,5.0,,"Great place to visit. It is a little way out, so we caught a taxi. Had a great day there. Loved the show and all of the different areas. It is so well kept and the birds looked healthy. Got to see so many different species, especially loved the pink flamingos. And enjoyed the nursery looking at all of the babies and how they were being so expertly looked after. It is a fairly big park so there is a lot of walking to do. Or you can pay extra and jump on the little tram. The waterfall is amazing. Spent most of the day there, so allow plenty of time. Discount available if you show your Singapore Airlines boarding pass. Highly recommend."
,,Great place to spend a few hours,3.0,,"The setting is wonderful and a great place to walk around and enjoy all the beautiful birds. A photographers dream place, we spend a few hours and really enjoy our time here"
,,One of the best Bird Park in the world,4.0,,Jurong Bird Park is definitely one of the best Bird Park in the world. Visitors are encourage to go for the 2 Free shows by the birds which is one of the highlights
,,Unexpectedly excellent,5.0,,"Not usually my sort of thing having seen many birds in the wild around the world, but the Jurong Bird Park is really well constructed, the birds well kept and visitors well cared for. Well worth a visit."
,,"Date with Flamingoes, Hornbills, Lories, Ostriches, Penguins et al @ Jurong!",4.0,,"The weather was great and we arrived at 9:30 a.m with online tickets. Being a weekday, there were few bird enthusiasts around so we had a great start, meeting the Penguins first. It helped to check the weather forecast and to plan the trip in advance for an early start.
The first show of the day, Kings of the Skies began at 10 where the Eagles, Falcons, Vultures and Kites lined up to perform. After the show we found ourselves amidst a lively Flamingo Pool and were on time to see the penguin feeding and caught up with the much talked about High flyers show at 11.
After the show move on at your pace. Have a great time feeding the Lories at the Lory loft and be ready with your cameras for great shots. Save up on the tram ride since the enclosures are quite near and you may have to alight and walk the same route up and down for a closer view of the birds. Have a great time!"
,,Lory Loft is amazing,4.0,,The interactive activities are great. The Lory Loft is crazy and a must see. Unfortunately many of the birds have very small pens. But hopefully the park is doing lots of work to help wild birds.
,,Delightful place to spend the day,5.0,,"The bird park is strangely located some ways out of town and accessible by bus, taxi or car - no MRT. It is surrounded by industrial parks but you don't feel that once inside the park.
The enclosures here are cleverly designed to suit the types of birds kept; there are several walk-in aviaries that enable you to get closer to the birds.
The penguin exhibit near the entrance is spectacular and there are king penguins - smaller cousins of the emperor penguins - which are absolutely delightful,
There are a number of shows and feeding sessions which are informative and fun. There is a tram service but it's not really necessary.
When we visited, the bird park has a membership campaign - for the price of a day's ticket (for Singaporeans), one can be a member and gain unlimited entries for the year! If you visit with a Singapore resident, there's also a discount on the entrance fees.
A welcome development, but sadly shows how desperate this excellent park is to attract visitors, compared to its more popular cousin, the Singapore Zoo,"
,,Excellent!,5.0,,A must visit for all age groups. Beautiful colorful birds..bird shows and lots more...You can feed the colorful parrots...a nice thrill. the kids around seemed to have loved and enjoyed the activity. good experience. value for money.
,,The biggest bird sanctuary in Singapore,5.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park at Bird Park Drive is under the management of Wildlife Reserves Singapore. The park covers an area of 49 acres and was first opened in 1971. To reach this park, take the green line and stop at Boon Lay MRT station. Then take bus 194 which brings you to the park. Bus 251 was withdrawn and now it does not reach this park.

The park has 600 species of birds including hornbills, owls, penguins, pelicans, flamingoes, macaws and lories. The entrance fee is $28 for adults and $18 for children below the age of 12. For seniors above 60 years, the fee is $12. The park opens from 8.30 am to 6.00 pm. There are train rides available and if you are hungry or thirsty there are cafes and restaurants galore.

The penguins are housed in an air con enclosure and they have a pool to swim and exercise. The nocturnal birds are housed in another enclosure where only dim lights are provided. There are also bird shows where the trainers command the falcons to obey them when they are signalled to do so. The bird show is an attraction for all visitors.

There is also a man-made waterfall reputed to be the tallest in south east Asia. The Lory Loft has a good collection of colourful lories and there are many macaws in some of the cages.
The bird park is worth a visit if you happen to be in Singapore ."
,,Great Experience,4.0,,was visiting a bird park per se for the first time and it was a really good experience.. the bird show was quite good.. the high flyers especially and everyone should watch it if going there.. a better experience than the shows at the night safari where I went later in the day/night.. variety of birds here and also the place has been beautifully done up
,,Excellent place..a must visit,5.0,,"It's a beautiful place to start with. So many species of birds are present there. If you are a bird lover this place will make you do all the sections and enjoy it. In Lory loft section you can feed the birds they will sit next to you and enjoy the food. Also the dark world having owls is nice to watch. If you go there don't miss the two shows, one is in amphitheatre and another in hawk arena. Tram is nice to have with hop on hop off service at each station."
,,Worth an afternoon visit,4.0,,"Vast number of different birds from all over the world.
There is a chance to hand feed small amazingly colourful parrots, but be careful if with small children as the birds can get feisty and their claws are fairly sharp. Also, watch out for the excessively expensive photos on site. The price changes every 10 seconds...

Very nice surroundings and well kept grounds. Set aside at least 2 to 3 hours to do the full visit comfortably."
,,I love this place 😍,5.0,,For bird lovers this is a 'the go to' place..the 2 bird shows are not to be missed either..the tram ride is not so great as it is a fast walk through and is a 15 min ride..check out the lory bird place where we can feed the birds..
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"Absolutely loved the bird park, there was a huge variety of birds in the park, as expected. It made me really happy to see how much they are promoting conservation abroad. The park was extensive and enjoyable."
,,Very intersting,3.0,,Very interesting place specially for children. You have to attend both shows offered. Ideal place to spend three hours in a good-weather day.
,,Long queue spoilt the visit.,4.0,,"Unfortunately, a half-hour wait to get a ticket spoilt our visitor experience of this otherwise excellent bird park. We visited during the half-term holiday, and there was only one person on the ticket kiosk. Recommend you get a ticket online in advance. The birds are great, though, especially the hornbills. A must-see for anyone interested in birds."
,,Its a must to those Bird Lovers,5.0,,"I enjoyed myself there and one of the memorable one will be at the Lorries. You can buy food to feed them and they will come over you to sit on your shoulders, hands and sometimes on your heads. You can take photos with them using your own camera or the guide there will professionally take photo of you with them. Shows and feeding time are one of the must things to do."
,,Its quite a long way from the City.,4.0,,"Having visited many of the attractions previously in Singapore decided to give this Bird Park a visit as keen photographers. If you like us have to get a taxi to here and then pay for the entrance fee it can be a fairly expensive day, Its not overly large but when its so hot and humid you feel its larger than it is. It does have a tram you can pay extra for and get on but this only stops at three or so stations. Children would no doubt enjoy the animals but in my opinion they would not be bothered about looking for birds which we wanted to photo. The Singapore Zoo is a much better option for children. We stopped at one of the eating places which was at the Waterfall and had the most disguisting and messy hot dog I have ever had. Had a couple of mouthfuls, got covered in tomato sauce and water from the sausage, so it went straight in the bin. Like many of the places of its kind food is on the expensive side. Will not be visiting again."
,,Kids Paradise.,5.0,,Went back the second time. It is a beautiful place. The lory loft and pelican feeding are great attractions.
,,Up close and personal !!,5.0,,"Children of all ages will love this park. I especially like the lory feeding programme whereby you can buy cups of nectar to feed to the lories at the open air aviary. However, the 1/4 cup of nectar is quite expensive at $3 but its towards conservation purposes. My daughter was absolutely fascinated by the sight of these birds feeding. Also don't miss the shows put on by the park rangers as they are quite impressive, especially the King of the Birds show. This showcases the various types of eagles and vultures found in the park.

I would strongly suggest buying the tram ticket (they are sold separately from the entrance tickets) as the park is situated on a hill slope. It's quite a grueling walk uphill to reach the major sections of the park. All-in-all, this is one of the best bird parks I have ever visited."
,,Bird park visit,4.0,,"This is an wonderful place to visit with family. The penguins, the sky train and all the other colourful birds provided a great entertainment. I wish to come here again and again."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Nice collection of birds and few are exotic too. Tram ride is also a good option if you do not want to sweat it out.
,,Lots of Beautiful Birds,4.0,,"We spent a few hours here and really enjoyed it. The tram ride gives a good overview of the park. We especially liked seeing the lorikeets, Cassowary, ostriches, eagles, vultures, parrots, and toucans. Our timing wasn't good for seeing any of the shows and we had limited time"
,,The best Bird Park,5.0,,This is by Far the best bird park that I have seen. Has a great collection of birds from around the world. Especially the beautiful parrots which are in the open. Dont miss the shows. A Must see for all tourist young and Old.
,,Famous Bird Park,4.0,,This Bird Park offer us the view from many birds. The Cages is big enough to fit so many birds inside. For children or even adult this is a good place to visit and enjoy while learning for the children to know kind of birds. This park is so well organized and very clean. If we are hungry there are some place to buy some food and drinks.
,,Excellent bird exhibits,4.0,,I just love hornbills and here there are so many different ones - and they are mostly very easy to see - even better at feeding time.. The keepers are passionate about their birds and their talks are so interesting. Across from the toucans are the Birds of Paradise - again from many countries. The Park had the first recorded case of captive breeding for the12-Wired Bird of Paradise in the world. Of course the Lory loft is delightful - you can see the crazy Aussie Lories up close and personal!
,,half day visit is sufficient,3.0,,"Some nice bird shows. You could possibly see most things in half a day. However, if you want o have an depth view on the birds, you may want more time."
,,Great Interaction With Nature,5.0,,If you love all types of birds then this is the place for you to visit. It is quite easy to spend a whole day here checking out the shows and seeing all the different varieties of birds.
,,Loved it,4.0,,"It took considerable efforts on my brother's part to persuade me to visit this place,but it was worth it.I saw penguins for the first time,and also ostrich,emu, cassowary, hornbills, emu,flamingos, pelicans, cockatoo, turacs and numerous other species of birds up close.The water safari was a total hit with my 3 year old nephew.Must visit for kids."
,,Beautiful world for nature lovers !,4.0,,"This is another major tourist attraction of Singapore which keeps on the excitement and amazement of how birds can be so beautiful and trained for the amazing acts performed by them at this place . We got the opportunity to be a part of the bird show conducted at 11am.
The birds could be see performing acts one couldn't have imagined of .
There is a regular tram service available for the tourists for those who cannot walk a lot can also see each and every part of this park .
The lake and the waterfall are another major attractions of this park . Clean toilets and good number of canteens on the way made our day at this place all the more comfortable .
Would recommend this place to all nature lovers !"
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is a sprawling, well landscaped park, offering a plethora of beautiful bird species. The caged areas are generally spacious, however the parrot cages are definitely too small. They can barely fly within their confines. You could see the birds were bored and lethargic. We attended one bird show which was fun. The halk show was full. The management promised a repeat but really had no intention of doing the extra show. Several of us returned at the appointed time and no one had the decency to tell us it was cancelled. The feeding stations were fascinating, an opportunity to see the birds at close range. Highly recommended."
,,Must Have If You have Sufficient Time,5.0,,"Firstly I want To tell you that this Park is Asia's Largest Bird Paradise in which you get more than 400 Species of Bird..
After Entering into the park you have on the right hand side Penguin coast in which you can see more than 50 Penguins across 5 Species to roam around & take your senses if you have not seen it yet.
After that you walk to the straight & you see the beautiful ostriches roam around freely with their Chirping Sounds.
After that you can see the show King of Skies in which you can see the Flying Hunter Eagles Flying above your heads.
After that you can see Different Species of Birds of your own or take a Tram to see the whole Beautiful Bird Park..
Please note the Timings of the best show you have ever seen which is the High Flyers Show in which lot of Colorful Birds & Flamingos are Flying Freely above your head which is Beautiful...
In this Bird can talk, sing or count even 1,2,3 also...
So Overall a must Have place to see if you have a Time & You are Bird Lover & If you are not a Bird Lover then Definitely You will be Fan of These Beautiful Birds.."
,,"Vast collection, many unseen species of birds. Shows are good too",4.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is very well maintained with a vast collection of birds I had never seen before. The way they are kept is also good. Loved the Larry Feeding. The shows (I attended the Kings of Sky and High Flyers) are super awesome. Overall, it took us about 3 hours to complete this.

To reach here, we took the mrt, alighted at Boon Lay and took a connecting bus."
,,"Nice place to visit, not that spacious",3.0,,"I have visited this place perhaps three times in my life. Nothing much have changed since my first visit. Unfortunately during my last visit, a lot of attractions were being renovated. We can't even see the penguins during the visit. The shows were nice and well orchestrated. But it might only took you less than 2 hours to explore the whole area due to the space constrains. Compared to the zoo or river safari, I think this park is relatively small. But I have to say, they tried their best to make full use of what they have.
To be frank, the ticket price is relatively expensive. So try to get some discounts buy buying a whole package of zoo, river safari, and bird park at the same time. In that way you can enjoy the park with a better price."
,,Peaceful day out for families,4.0,,We were on a tour to the Jurong Bird park.. sadly it rained when we were at the last bird show but staff kept wiping down chairs and we had umbrellas from our hotel to keep us dry. They needed more trams to get you around as each time it came a large group of people filled them wanting to get to the bird shows. IT took us 4 times to finally get on a tram. The two shows we saw were wonderful but went far too quick before we had to leave. Recommend to allocate the time to go and stay for a few hours especially for families
,,Amazing place..,5.0,,"This is a must see place,especially if you have kids. The kids would enjoy this place a lot specially the Penguins and the parrots. There is a kids water play area , that's fun. Ensure to apply mosquito and insect repellent."
,,Very good place to visit with family,5.0,,Enjoyed the trip with family very much. We had taken very good pictures and will remember the trip for a long time.
,,Flocks of Flamingos and Pelicans,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park isn't close to the city, but completely worth it, don't miss it. We travelled by train to the terminus and then a bus that stopped directly outside it, very easy.

Like everything in Singapore, there are lush green gardens here. Take note at the entrance as to what interactive displays they have with the birds and at what times. You can also pay to take a small train around the birdpark if you wish, but really you won't get to see much that way. There are birds in the usual large cages and then large ponds with large flocks of flamingoes, or pelicans that are stunning.

There are icecream stands inside if you're feeling hot. There is a restaurant inside, but it looked expensive, best to eat at the two places at the entrance. Look at both food shops before you decide though, one has very western burger style meals at around $15 and the other attached to the gift shop has lovely set meal options at around $6, which is where we had a sit down meal."
,,A Must See,5.0,,"This is a fabulous bird park. There is so much to see here and plenty of activities for children. I often go bird watching and love birds so have mixed feelings about caged birds - but it is clear the Jurong Bird Park staff take excellent care of the birds and are involved heavily in conservation work. The birds have plenty of room except the hornbills. I have seen hornbills in the wild many times and they need about 10 times the space they have at the Park as a minimum.

We thought the quiet dark area where the astonishing owls are should be patrolled by the staff as people were very noisy despite the signs telling them to keep quiet!

Other than that the variety of birds and the beautiful lay out of the Park make this a really wonderful day out. It's fabulous.

Go early to catch the shows. The website has details of all the current shows.

Practicalities (1) You need comfy flat shoes (2) The best way to get there is by MRT to Boon Lay and then the 194 bus. To get back just go to the 194 bus stop where you got off, the bus carries on for about 5 minutes and then goes round a roundabout and down the other side of the road. This is easier than crossing the very wide busy road via the underpass. (3) Spray with citronella or some other ""bird friendly"" anti mosquito stuff if you are prone to getting bitten (4) Book in advance as we queued for quite a while on a Thursday morning (5) There are lots of places to shelter if it rains.

You will love this place. Highly recommended."
,,Great,5.0,,"We arrived in time for the bird display held at 11-00am. A must see. Then a lovely walk around the park, visiting all the aviaries. I am a keen bird watcher, so normally, the idea of birds in captivity is not something that I would enjoy. I have to say, all the birds look healthy and content. Do have on and take some anti bite stuff though.
The one thing that does get to me.. Why do people spend their time ' selfie' ing themselves, standing in the way of everyone else and expect us to give them space for self posing? They would have been much better enjoying the birds instead of themselves!
This place deserves better."
,,Truly 5 star experience,5.0,,"What an amazing experience. Just like the zoo, this is one of the best bird sanctuaries in the world. Had been to one in Malaysia as well, but this one takes the cake. The shows were special. The overall look and feel is awesome. Birds are treated with so much love and care."
,,Wide Range of Birds,5.0,,"The attraction is getting better and better, the restaurant is not so big but offer foods that acceptable for the whole family. The tram service is nice."
,,Really nice half day visit,4.0,,"I really enjoyed this. I arrived in time for the 10am eagle/hawk show, followed by penguin feeding and then the highflyers show. Really well presented, although I would like to have seen more empasis on conservation and educating people that keeping birds in cages is destroying the birdlife in its natural habitat. Exhibits were well laid out with good signposting. I didn't use the tram - it's not that far to walk around. The day I went was overcast with a couple of showers but there were places to shelter so it wasn't a problem and did make it cooler. Recommended."
,,Amazing Park,4.0,,Not to be missed by any lover of birds. You can easily spend more than a day here and has something for all ages.
,,good one time experience,4.0,,The hawk eye and pool amphitheatre shows are the highlight of this park. Its well maintained and can be traversed on foot or tram. Kids will love it.
,,Nearly had memorable as the zoo!,5.0,,What a great park. So many great bird shows. Beautiful enclosures. Huge collection of species on display. A must see
,,Mixed Feelings for an otherwise great attraction,4.0,,"As a local, I find that it remains a captivating experience to visit the JBP. It's an ideal size that will not tire out people, yet provide enough sights to delight. The main show is awesome, however many times I've seen it.

They've made the effort to revamp the place in shades so that it always feels a bit new. I like how they have set up mobile snack points, albeit in need of healthier snack options as well.

Yet.... I cannot help but feel sad walking around. Such beauty belongs in the wild (yeah, I'm a bleeding heart) and space limitation (and zoo animal management) requires that some of the creatures are confined to an area that inhibits their natural behaviour. This was exhibited by the fact quite a few animals were showing signs of stress, and depression.

It is a mixed argument about this. I do wish visitors will find out more about conservation and pass these precious lessons to their kids - there isn't a more fantastic place to do that."
,,Good day out,4.0,,"We have been before but this time was better. Kids ages 1 5 & 7 all had lovely time, especially feeding the birds and at the water park area. Oh and seeing the flamingos, great day out.. Cant comment on the food we took our own healthy snacks :)"
,,Strutting birds Beautiful Park,4.0,,"I visited here with my niece , where we see African Waterfall Aviary, the hornbill and toucan exhibit,Flamingo Lake , Penguin Coast. The water fall is manmade. Lake full of hundreds strutting birds. The park have beautiful area colorfull birds.. Definately visit again here..."
,,Eagles and Emus!,5.0,,This is a good place to see lots of birds. You can even feed lori birds in a big aviary. Lots of fun for the kids. You discover the diffrent personalities of birds. They can be quite charming!
,,A fun day out.,4.0,,"This is a great day out especially for families. Lots of fascinating things to see, loved going on the little train which took us around the park.We ended up seeing a fantastic bird show which was great for everyone of all ages."
,,"Big Park, perfect for long walks and bird fans/entuthiasts",5.0,,"My husband love birds, he wanted to see birds so we went, and we really enjoyed, the problem is to be able to get a taxi when closing time, huge queues! It's pretty accessible from city center by train and bus. We loved the waterfall and the colorful birds around the area that look like peacocks. There were some big lizards nearby the big pool with some cranes. We missed the shows but they seem to be great for families with children. Wear comfortable walking/trekking shoes since you'll probably be walking lots! And also you'll be walking and sometimes climbing up in some wet parts so I would avoid high heels and loose sandals."
,,Worth spending 3-4 Hours from your Singapore Itinerary,4.0,,"Better than Bird Parks of other Far East countries like Malaysia or Thailand. Align your visit with their fixed time bird shows. Kids would enjoy it more than once but for adults, you could give it a miss if you have already seen similar bird parks else where. It takes up lot of time and money to reach there since Public Transport is not so convenient and Taxis are expensive. Jurong is kinda outskirts so the only destination you will cover is this Bird Park so the effort to reach there cannot be optimized by clubbing anything else on this trip."
,,Big Place and Great Experience,4.0,,"One has to buy an admission ticket for this place. Get here around 10.30am to catch the High Flyers Show(@ 11am) and some front row/preferred seating. You'll experience various bird flights i.e, parrots, horn-bills, and also a singing episode by a cute parrot. Then, you'll finally see the flamingos that would amaze you for sure. Don't just turn back ones the show comes to an end, as you can grab a chance to take snaps with the flamingos.

The show lasts for around 20mins.

Then you may take the tram and go around the park. This is a hop-off and hop-on service. A must hop-off place is the Lory Loft. Get in and try feeding the parrots. You'll just love the experience."
,,"Great collection of birds, well presented",5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park has excellent collection of birds. Loved their ""Lory Loft"" and ""Parrots Sections."" Good shows. It gets tiresome to walk in hot weather at times. Tram can be availed but at extra cost and it could show only what is visible outside."
,,A Must Visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Great place, with lot of activities to do, love feeding the birds. You'll love to take pictures with birds and enjoy the mother nature beauty. Birds are free every where, where pleasant view for eyes. Really amazing place for mind & Soul peace."
,,Amazing Aviary,5.0,,The place is immaculately planned sanctuary for birds. Birds from almost all continents are reared with great care. The environment & vegetation of the garden looks natural.
,,Awe inspiring birds and bird shows,5.0,,"When we were planning to visit this place my friends told me that its for kids. After visiting this place I am glad to say that its for everyone, irrespective of the age group. The bird shows are awe inspiring and so is viewing so many different species of birds from different parts of the world. I specifically loved the flamingo pond, and the creatures of the darkness (10 different types of owls housed in different chambers in a big dark room). Also, its commendable how the management team of the park is focused on conservation of rare species of birds, and also caring about each and every bird. I would like to bring my parents and in-laws and everyone I can hundred more times to this park. Kudos!!"
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"Amazing...you can take pics with birds sitting on your head, hand, shoulders,.. lovely birds..one can take the tram to cut on the foot travel"
,,A Paradise for bird-lovers,5.0,,"Jurong Bird park is located a bit outside the city center and it’s better to take a cab to reach there. But there are also buses that pick you up from both the city center and at the Singapore Zoo. The nearest MRT station to Jurong Bird Park is Boon Lay on the East-West (Green) line and from there take Bus No. 194 that will take you right to the Bird Park.

The Park has one of the largest bird collections in the world. The park is open daily from 8.30 am to 6pm and tickets are priced at 18 SGD. The Parkhopper card includes entrance into Singapore Zoo, Night safari and Jurong Bird Park. If you want the train for going around, it will cost you another 5 SGD. Please note that even if you take the train, you will have to get down and walk to see the birds closely. If you want to see the park in full, you need to walk through the entire park, in which case you don’t have to go for the train ticket. But, if you have limited time and want to see only selected places, then you can go for the train ticket.

This is a sprawling bird park, where you can see parrots, macaws, pelicans, vultures, eagles, swans and ostriches. The penguins are kept in an air-conditioned room with ice added to the water.

The Lory Loft was interesting for kids and adults as well. Here, for a small fee, you can feed the lories eat out of your hand. If you don’t want to pay, you can use the used cups lying there. Even without food, we had these birds all over our body and we had to put them off from our body to move out of this place. It was really amusing.

There are bird shows in specific places. Try to catch the High Flyers show at the Pools Amphitheatre, which is held twice a day, at 11am & 3 pm, and is included in the admission price. The performers included hornbills, toucans, parrots, flamingos and cockatoos. You can watch Macaws playing basketball and Amigo singing a song. Birds fly over the audiences heads and some items are involving the spectators.

Other interesting places and activities are Flamingo Lake, Pelican Cove, Penguin Coast,, 'World of Darkness' owl exhibit, Parrot Paradise, ""Lunch with Parrots"", High Flyers Show

A Singapore experience wouldn’t be complete without a day at the Jurong Bird Park."
,,Birds Birds and Birds,5.0,,"Play with birds, dance with birds, eat with birds. Take photograph with birds. have breakfast with birds .Do whatever you want to do with birds. Its must for kids and family."
,,Beautiful Bird Park,4.0,,"My previous visit was MANY years ago , but the Park is as delightful as I remember it . Sadly . the monorail circuit I so enjoyed then ( to the background music of ''Swan Lake'' I seem to recall ? ) no longer operates , but the beauty of the location remains . The waterfall remains spectacular , and the birds are still fascinating . Unfortunately a rain storm caused the show with the Birds of Prey to be cancelled , but the other show was all that I remembered it to be , both charming and amusing .
Wanted to avoid the standard half day organised Tour this time . I found this Tour too rushed and regimented , with insufficient time allowed to amble around and enjoy the tranquility of the location . So we did our own thing to allow ourselves a more relaxed time at our own pace .Therefore , took a train to Boon Lay station . Here is the very large Jurong Point Mall , supposedly the largest complex of its type in suburban Singapore , and undoubtedly an attraction in its own right. Getting a taxi for the short ride to the Bird Park from here is simple . However , we had to wait some considerable time for a taxi for the return journey to Boon Lay . This may have been due to the fact that the afternoon rush hour had now arrived , and it was still raining heavily ."
,,go for the experience loved it,5.0,,This was an interesting place to visit lots of birds and lovely setting.adults and children will love it. would go again when in the future.
,,Lory Loft is a treat!,4.0,,"We loved the whole atmosphere in the Jurong bird park. Amazing fun! Lotsa different birds from across the world. They have a tram / train that drops you to various points. For us the highlight was the Lory Loft. Amazingly done and a lovely place to feed the birds, have some fun clicking pictures with them. There is also a rope bridge which you can walk down to. Nice place! Loved it. Some very good bird shows too incl the Birds of Prey. Go a few mins early to catch a good place. Sit opposite the stage so you can be picked up for some tricks with the birds ;) Great for kids to watch, learn and discover the diversity in these wonderful colour ful creatures."
,,"JURONG BIRD PARK, GREAT FAMILY DAY OUT",4.0,,"really enjoyed a day out at Jurong Bird Park - go during week, not as busy, lunch is average, but has a bird show so that was good for the kids, as they could participate.
park itself is really good, good variety, and feeding birds is the highlight. would go back again, and dont go on a hot day !!! as it's all outdoors (obviously)
great for kids, families and couples. - enjoy"
,,"Great collection, must see for families",5.0,,"Got a chance to visit during a business trip. Amazing collection of birds, including a great owl house. If you're in Singapore, this is a must see, especially for families."
,,Magic of color and nature,5.0,,"It is the really magical place which these birds have this shining colors and amazing shapes, it is great place to learn and connect to nature."
,,A massive collection in lovely grounds,5.0,,"Although we'd been to Singapore a couple of times, we'd never visited Jurong, mainly due to experiencing the delights of the KL Bird Park and also feeling that the Zoo offered a more rounded experience. We took the opportunity this visit though and were certainly not disappointed that we went, particularly as we hear that it may well be relocated in the future nearer to the Zoo. It was easy to get to, Boon Lay Station (EW27) on the MRT and then the 194 bus from the interchange in the shopping centre. It's a big park and would recommend taking in the shows, mainly to get the most out of the visit particularly if you have children. We felt that children and adults without a real interest would soon be bored. I've never seen such a comprehensive collection of horn-bills & toucans, but can't imagine all being as thrilled! The Lory Loft was good fun but beware as there are larger parrots in here and although a Lory will give a nip, these larger birds BITE! Some of the aviaries are tired but in general we found the conditions good. Of the enclosed aviaries the Waterfall one is lovely, but there's never the sense of freedom or space that one feels in the KL Bird Park. We found the World of Darkness very poor however and what could have been the most interesting area for us was the worst. You couldn't really see the birds and I don't think they could have been comfortable in the conditions. Containing a bird is one thing, but denying it natural light and habitat is quite a different matter. There were diurnal birds of prey kept in this perpetual midnight state. Skip this if visiting; you won't be missing much and will have a better experience. This negative aside, if you like birds, it's a lovely place to visit and we were particularly impressed with the Bird of Prey show which was very nicely done. Don't forget your mosquito repellent and allow yourself half a day."
,,Pleasant morning with the birds,5.0,,"My husband and I spent 2-12 hours one morning here. The aviary with the 100 foot waterfall, flamingo lake, and lorries feeding aviary were really fun. Everyone who likes nature and birds will enjoy the park a lot!"
,,Great with the children...,3.0,,They take out most of the bieds from the zoo and made this park... because you wont find any impressive birds left in the zoo... Go early... Transportation is not good... Take a taxi... I had a hard time finding taxi back in the evening
,,Fun and exciting for all ages,5.0,,the birds are too colurful and interesting.. the best part is feeding them on your hands and they just keep on coming back flying around you.. the entrance fees and the restaurants prices are acceptable compared to sentosa...
,,One of the world leading bird parks,5.0,,"Imagine my surprise when having travelled the world I found the best most professionally run bird park in this small country of Singapore! Everything is excellent here. The shows are extremely entertaining and some down right hilarious. All the shows are very creative, superbly timed, with highly trained staff and animals in excellent health and condition. We saw the show with the Eagles and both my son and daughter participated in it and loved it!! Another show was with birds showing flight agility intelligence and understanding. I think it was called high fliers, not sure though. All the shows were marvellous and will leave you gasping at the skill of these trainers.
I came away from the bird park with awe, admiration and kudos for this country which has quietly risen from the back to become a leading power in finance, biotechnology, education and now also ..entertainment. Hats off Singapore! Well done jurong bird park, I will visit as often as I can, when I am in Singapore."
,,Lovely place to visit,5.0,,Had excellent time at the bird park with my daughter! We love to go back every 6 months. the shows are awesome and up close and personal with the rare birds!
,,"Awesome shows, lot of birds",4.0,,"Positives- Lot of birds (including a huge collection of hornbills, has birds of paradise, bali mynah etc) with awesome settings that allows you to view them up close whenever possible. Great shows to impress even those who aren't really into birds.
Negatives- Had to cover a long distance around the park walking, the train had only four stops which implies you have to walk all the intermediate regions. They should probably have more stops. Also, some exhibits were closed on the day we went, which weren't mentioned on the website.."
,,For Bird Lovers,4.0,,Even if You Have Visited Safari The Bird Park is a Must for Bird Lovers There is also a small amusement park for kids which they can enjoy in the heat and you can go for bird watching
,,awesome,5.0,,"A beautiful bird sanctuary , amazing aviaries and species of birds . Well worth a visit, made easy by the great Singapore transport system !"
,,A nice place for a few hours,3.0,,"We took a taxi from hotel near Brash basah station. It took about 30 minutes to get to Jurong, was quite cheap.
Jurong was a nice place to stay for few hours, not any longer.
We bought tickets to hop on-hop off train (few dollars more) which was good decision,because of the heat! Then we decided places we wanted to see better,and check them out.
There was beautiful waterfall and beautiful birds! Restaurants, toilets and the smoking area outside of the park. One restaurant inside the park.
Didn't like the fact that parrots was kept on small cages.."
,,An Avian Kaliedoscope,5.0,,A beautifully landscaped abode for birds from all across the world right from dinosaur descendants and parakeets to penguins of the poles. A walk through the Lory Loft would be a memorable experience feeding the parrots and macaws.
,,"Nice bird park, but some of the enclosures were disappointing",3.0,,"We had an enjoyable day at Jurong, with the highlight of the day being the High Flyers bird show which included low flying, talking and singing birds. Some enclosures were spacious and enabled visitors to see the birds clearly. Others unfortunately were surrounded by thick wire, with visitors kept at least a meter from the enclosure, which made taking photos and seeing the birds clearly difficult. Other enclosures were quite smelly."
,,Needs an Update,3.0,,"On this visit to Singapore we visited Jurong Bird Park again. The park is easily accessible by Metro - to BOON LAY station on the east west line then transfer to the bus interchange to Bus No 194 which runs a regular service to and from the bird park.

At the bird park we noted that once again Singapore has introduce multiple pricing for locals and tourists - for tourists the entrance fee was $SG 33 (no discount).
Several areas of the park we closed for renovations.

There is a tram service around the park which stops at three stations - Main Stn, Lorry Loft - well worth a visit to feed the lorikeets and Waterfall stn to visit the indoor waterfall .

The park has a huge array of bird life - but on this visit we noted that the park has a run down appearance - needs a coat of paint in may places and many of the aviaries require updating - in fact some of the birds appeared distressed especially in the parrot exhibits

There are various areas for having a meal - we had lunch in the BONGO BURGERS restaurant - well worth a visit

The main impression we had of the park in this visit is that the park requires an update/renovation"
,,so many cute clever birds.. fell in love with them..,5.0,,"this is a vast area and takes good amount of time. U need to plan better if u want to cover things at the shortest time.there are trams taking you thru the park at certain intervals.
you will have to time the shows and the visits.
there are show like high flyer show,king of skies and lunch with parakeets. tip:ensure to sit in the front rows for king of skies show especially ladies will get to volunteer. my wifey got lucky. and kids for the high flier show. gents should sit in the centre of right side of left side or the central portion for maximising the chance to volunteer. believe me its an awesome chance to interact.
and feeding times for lory loft feeding, penguin feeding etc.
you need to get the show timings and adjust your tram journey accordingly.
the tram stops at different stations like lory loft , water fall aviary etc. so u can go multiple times in the tram go around one stop and come back visit the planned show hop back in tram and visit the next station for a stroll.
this way you can minimise your time and won't miss a show.
they do have rental prams for kids.
they is a restaurant in case if kids are hungry."
,,Not very exciting place to see exotic see birds and expensive entry fee,3.0,,"Not very exciting place to see exotic see birds. Entry fee is expensive and pay extra for a train raid around the park. Entrants not allowed to take photos with exotic birds, only if entrants have the photos taken by the park's photographer at the entrance of the park. You need to buy feeds to feed rainbow lorikeets."
,,Jurong Bird park is for kids,4.0,,"We visited Jurong bird park on Jan 16, 2016. There is no crowd as such, although lot of people were there. They are too many variety and you can easily spend half day there. There are two shows there. Shows are ok type.
It is very convenient to reach Jurong bird park with public transport. Just alight at Boon lay MRT and as you get down, right there is bus interchange, you can get Bus no 194. At very first stop in bus, Jurong bird park is there. It can be quite a task catching taxi back from Jurong Bird park. There was a long line. But it was easy with public transport. Just at the opposite of park catch bus 194 for Boon Lay MRT.
It is very expensive taking your photo with birds at the entrance of park. 35$ for a photo with birds on your hand was too much for us. But this is everywhere in Singapore."
,,Not much too see,2.0,,We were a bit dissapointed. The place was very far. Not so many birds we could see at that time. Restaurants inside are insanely expensive for what it is (fast food for one menu is aroind sgp 22).
,,If you like birds - Go!,4.0,,A lot of interesting birds to watch. The best places is the large open cages were you walk inside and have free view to the birds. The tucans and parrots are caged in so they are difficult to take pictures without getting the fence in front of it. All in all a good experience and will go there again.
,,Lots of hype,2.0,,"We felt it was a lot hyped place than real... there was a decent queue for tram and it does not serve much purpose as most of the times we end up walking back to see what came in between. Places was not really clean and stinky at places.
It has some good birds and you find lot more birds in other zoo which are not so famous. Overall, I would recommend to go there only if you have spare time."
,,A place where all birds gather. Interesting.,5.0,,"Like the zoo, interesting place to be, especially the section where you get to feed the tiny parrots. They simply walk up to u and start feeding from your hand. Was a great experience!"
,,The Birds,5.0,,"Most interesting place for people of every age group. So many different things going on . Shows with the birds was truly amazing, never would have believed what things even toucans can do. A MUST DO"
,,Personally we were disappointed by our visit,3.0,,"We took the MRT from the city to Boon Lay, then we crossed the road to the bus station to get the 194 bus, travel taking circa 90 minutes. Cost to enter the park SGD$28pp.
Many of the birds are hard to see as the cages are old, with old thick wire restricting view - no chance of clear photographs as the cage dominates. We appreciate securing the birds in space that does not stress them is essential, but we have been to many bird parks where the cages are much more viewer friendly. A number of displays were closed for improvement work (which is hopefully good news, given our previous comment). We watched one of the twice daily bird shows which was limited and disappointing, having been spoiled by the high quality of a similar style show at Taronga Zoo in Sydney. The talking parrot was amusing and the flamingos walking on stage at the end were the highlights. The walk through areas had few bird species that are rare or excite. Staff were not engaging, unlike the staff at Singapore Zoo.
Coffee just before we entered the park was good, but all in all we left feeling disappointed with the visit and value for money."
,,Very nice,4.0,,This is an amazing place. Please make sure that you watch the shows organised by the organisers which are held everyday at particular time. Also try to feed the birds as they come over your body and it is an amazing experience all together
,,Super shows,5.0,,"Attended two bird shows - Kings on skies - Pools amphitheater Both are stupendous, well trained birds and organizers.. must visit."
,,Amazing place to visit in Singapore,5.0,,"We took the MRT! Kinda far, but hey, how far can Singapore be! So I went there with my boyfriend and definitely a place to go to see some exotic animals."
,,朝から行くことをオススメします！,5.0,,"旅行でシンガポールに訪れたときに、行きました。(旅行日程を最後に載せているので、参考に)

朝から行くことをオススメします。
なぜなら鳥のショーや餌やり体験などは、午前と夕方の時間に固まっているからです。

せっかく行くのなら、ただ鳥を見学するだけじゃなく、ショーや餌やり体験した方が楽しいです。

★オススメポイント1:Show
ショーも、基本的に参加型で、客席近くを鳥が飛び回ったり、会場全体を使うので臨場感があります。
英語が少しできるなら、ショーの途中で、選ばれた人だけ肩に鷹を乗せたり、蛇に触ったりする体験があるので、おすすめします。

★オススメポイント2:Feeding
餌やり体験は、とっても楽しいです。
私たちはオウムの餌やりをしましたが、餌が入ってるカップを持っているだけで、たくさんの鳥が集まってきました。
頭に乗ってきたり、iPadに止まってきたり！
友だちや周りの参加者と、きゃーきゃー言いながら楽しみました。
時間ぴったりに間に合わなくても、餌を売ってくれるので大丈夫です。

★オススメポイント3:Watching
日本と違って、とにかく柵がないのが、シンガポールの動物園の特徴だと思います。
のびのびとした環境だからか、動物たちも元気に飛び回っていたり、鳴いていたり、見ている方も動きがあると楽しいです。

☆やらなかったこと
確か、鳥たちと一緒にレストランで、ブレックファースト、ランチ、ディナーを出来る体験があったのですが、私たちは、翌日にシンガポールズーでオラウータンとのブレックファーストを控えていたので、時間とお金の節約のため、やりませんでした。
なので、感想は言えません。

★アクセス
朝から楽しく遊んで、ショーも見て、餌やりもやって、満足したので、
昼過ぎくらいの無料シャトルバスに乗って、リバーサファリに行きました。

(ちなみに、行きは、シティ近くのホテルからシャトルバス出てるようですが、
私たちオープンに合わせて入場したかったので、ホテルからタクシーに乗りました)

★チケット
事前にネットで、買うとお得です。

シンガポールズー・リバーサファリ・バードパーク・ナイトサファリをまとめて購入しました。

★まとめ
ショーや餌やり体験が魅力的なので、シンガポールに来たら行った方がいいと思います。
時間的には、一日中かかるわけではないので、(私たちは朝から1時半くらいまでで全部回れました)午後から他の用事を入れることもできます。

,,Good for a couple of hours trip,4.0,,"Visited on a rainly day; slightly drizzling. Lots of birds are there; but some varieties were repeating. The waterfall was nice. We didn't get chance to go for the show. If you like to see the show plan early about the timing.
Overall, for the 1st time visitor it woyld be good experience, but we felt it is bit overpriced while visiting 2nd time."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"This was highly recommended by friends and family and we were not disappointed. The park has a large variety of birds and we got to learn about so many exotic species. Some of the hornbills looked too good to be real!

The tram was very useful especially since there were heavy rains when we visited.

Do not miss the High Flyers show. It is a very charming performance put on by macaques and several other exotic birds.

The Hawk show is also supposed to be good but we couldn't see it because of the rains.

There is wet play area for kids which has many fountains and slides. This was just the icing on the cake!"
,,Well maintained bird park,5.0,,Be prepared to walk a lot. Too much to see. If you have little kids visit the star attractions first.
,,This is one of the best experiences on our trip to Singapore.,5.0,,A great attraction. Well worth the value. One of the best attractions in Asia. The shows were especially will planned. The staff are passionate about their work and it shows.
,,Good tourist attraction!,4.0,,"Visiting Jurong bird park is a great way to spend a day in singapore. I always check out zoo's and national parks when abroad and i must say that the jurong bird park is truly unique. Very well made with a lot of different species of birds. I would recommend to firstly taking the tram to get a good feel of the place. You can hop on and hop-off several times on the tram so one doesnt have to cover the entire park on foot. As soon you enter one should find out the various timings of the shows and encounters and plan visiting the other sections accordingly. Feeding the birds at lorry loft was awesome fun!! Dont miss that. Let the birds sit on your heads, shoulders fingers etc. They are totally safe and playful. Total duration was about 3-4 hours."
,,Beautiful Birds !!! Pleasant Park !!!,5.0,,"We can see many variety of birds not in cages but in huge open enclosures flying freely, the top attraction being pink colour cranes and speaking Macawos at Songbird Terrace.

We can feed the parrots at Port loft, the stroll along the suspended bridges was fabulous, it was a absolute treat to our eyes.

Falconry show was one of the most important show and the walk along the man mafe waterfall Aviary was memorable, took some wonderful photos and videos to cherish for our entire lifetime.

Must visit for all age groups when we are in Singapore, children will enjoy a lot, though the entry fee is High, it's worth spending for the experience we get."
,,An Interesting Watch,3.0,,"This bird park was superb in terms of their collection and display of birds. The high flyer show was quite impressive. The white owls, the flamingos were superb &,lory feeding was worth doing.. Very clean and green surroundings."
,,Real Fun,4.0,,"My kids enjoyed the Bird Park, especially feeding the birds/parrot,peacock and waterfall.There were show but the timing of the show was not able to cover in 2 hours."
,,Much more than a bird park !!,5.0,,"Gardens, scenery, variety of bids unbelievable !!. Flying displays fantastic. A parrot who sings an opera - weird and wonderful. Don't miss it - it's not just a "" bird park "" Fred from Liverpool Jan 2016"
,,Excellent bird park for both tourists and locals,5.0,,"Being a local, we don't often visit local tourist attractions due to high cost. Our last visit to the bird park was 10 years ago. It was pretty good then. Recently, my family revisited the bird park in conjunction with the park's 45th birthday and what a wonderful surprise it was. The bird park is very beautifully planned with lots of exotic birds. There is a very large children's playground with water play structures. If you are visiting with children, bring an extra set of clothes as they will enjoy getting wet in the playground. The shows are a must see - so remember to plan your visit to coincide with the show timings."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"This is one of the best bird parks I have seen. There are not only birds that are part of the bird park but they also have a lot of wild bird visitors.

It is really hot and humid especially in the Waterfall Avery but it is all worth it. The parrot paradise is also a great experience because you get to walk around the area with parrots flying around you. Very very good experience.

I would definitely recommend this and would definitely do it again."
,,A shame the tour was dreadful,4.0,,"We booked a tour to go the bird park before we left Australia. Unfortunately this was a disaster. We were picked from the hotel and them taken to the transfer station. The bus was delayed leaving due to a truck being stuck at the exit so no buses could arrive ore leave. After a hour and half late we finally left to the park. The tour guide was not very friendly, She informed us when we finally arrived that we would still be leaving at the original time set, this gave us 2 hours to spend at the park. This was definitely not long enough to see the whole park. We didn't see most of the park, which was a real shame it looked beautiful. Once we returned back to our hotel the bus driver dropped us off on the other side of the road in traffic with 3 children. I would recommend you take a taxi and spend as much time you like there, that's what we will do next time. Taxis are very cheap."
,,Nice Place,5.0,,"Its a beautiful place. There are all sort of birds. I visited this place with family in December 2015. There are good notes available at every place so people can get information about the same. During weekends, there are good number of activities for the kids. Overall nice place to visit.. You need one full day to cover it. There is thrilling dolphin show also."
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park has almost every species to impress avian lovers, along with fun exhibits, interactive shows, and of course, its charming residents."
,,Getting Close to Birds,4.0,,"Quite lots of birds kinds here. My husband is birds' lover, so the forest conditioned place with so many free birds which we can touch and feed, amused my husband so much. The mini human made fountain is great to enjoy."
,,A nice experience,4.0,,My girlfriend and I spent a couple of hours in this place. There is enough birds diversity to satisfy even the pickiest visitor. The food in the restaurants was a little pricey...
,,If you love Birds ....,4.0,,"This place is for you, if you love birds. Hundreds of them and mostly free. Don’t miss the shows and check the show timings when entering the Park. Spend half a day specially with kids , They would love it."
,,Big park with lots of different birds,5.0,,Grab a map of the park ! It's rather big !! I Was able too see all the birds I wanna see and Many others I have not seen before..the lorikee feeding bridge enclosure is a must for taking up close pics.
,,Happy 45th Year,5.0,,We had been 5 years before and came with our 8 year old. A great collection of birds and some entertaining shows. It was great to see the Toucans and enjoyed the option to feed the parrots.
,,Good but need to be in an different location,4.0,,Nice but i would prefer it to be an little more pivacy in those park as like zoo ! i can hear the souds of the constructions happening near by thats no good Must see all shows there
,,For Bird Lovers,5.0,,"Being a bird lover, i thoroughly enjoyed this place. The shows are fantastic. I had lunch with the parrots. Pikasso does a great job painting. Lots of different birds to view. trams to take you from 1 stop to the next. Envolves walking. Take the aerogard"
,,Huge collection of birds,4.0,,Expect one day in the park as it has great collection of Birds to see. There are plenty of food places and restrooms. Great for the whole family and kids will surely enjoy.
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"A must visit attraction in Singapore. Lots of species of birds with an excellent bird show, check the timings before you go on their web-site. Good for kids and adults alike."
,,Excellent Habitat for the Birds,5.0,,"This an bird park unlike any I have seen. Usually birds are cooped up in unattractive cages. Here they fly freely thanks for a vast net over the whole area. As a result, the happy birds are able to flit around doing what birds love to do. It was delightful being so close and personal with many attractive birds. I strongly recommend this attraction."
,,thrilling,5.0,,a must visit if travelling to singapore you can see a variety of birds.. very interesting and infirmative highly recommended
,,Up Close and Personal,4.0,,"If you love birds or perhaps, ornithologist is the dream, You cannot miss this.
The experience on some of the attractions within of course is fantastic, that'll you'll probably not forget.
Like Singapore's Zoo, it too is built with great convenience for the tourist in mind.
Pleasant paths with peacocks and jungle fowl roaming freely."
,,Good for families,4.0,,"We visited here in January, we were impressed with the overall park, it was spacious, lots of greenery. Some of the birds were impressive, although, I did think how sad it was that these amazing birds, like eagles, didn't have much space to really spread their wings & fly.
The show is entertaining, its free & outside."
,,Fun for the Family,4.0,,Nice colorful birds and nice shows. The kids will really enjoy. Birds are kept in hygienic and open air environment.
,,Nice big park,4.0,,"Big park with large variety of birds.
Many children play areas too as well as restaurants and snack / drink stalls.

Plan to spend at least couple of hours to cover all the displays.

Parrots section is probably most impressive as so many colorful birds are on display.

One thing which I didn't like is that some of the cages and enclosures seem too small for the birds and seem birds are rather miserable (particularly night owl section)."
,,A wonderful park dedicated to birds,5.0,,Jurong bird park is a zoo dedicated to birds. It is well organized. The shows are a must. You should take time touring the bird park as there are many different types of birds. You should also splurge to take a picture with the parrot (macow). You should definitely not miss this attraction in Singapore.
,,Family visit to bird park,3.0,,"Bird park along with zoo and night safari vwere part of the planned holiday trip. The web page mentioned 45%off on third January, however it was only for locals and foreign tourists were excluded. This was unfortunately only mentioned on another page.
Word for advice for tourists is cto buy tickets online. Take a park hopper if planning to visit all the parks.
Now for the bird park, its relatively small, but can be very muggy and hot if there is no wind blowing. The shows are good and the highlight. Previously there was opportunity for having pictures with birds sitting on shoulders and hand. Unfortunately they only put small birds on a wooden stick and ask you to hold the stick.
The park is in a different location as compared to the zoo. If four poeple then take a taxi. Average fare would be 20$ if coming from the orchard area."
,,i had a different idea...,2.0,,i thought the Bird Park essentially promotes natural habitat and freedom for birds... not so... almost all birds live in small confined cages... some cages have almost a 100 birds cramped in and the owl enclosure is the size of the back of a pick up.. pitiful.... broke my heart to see the birds like that.. i will never ever pay money to visit and promote that again...
,,Average!,3.0,,"We found it quite average. Varieties of birds are just ok, not so great! Overall the park is maintained very well. Could not see the birds' show, so cannot comment whether that would have been a differentiator!"
,,The very best bird park! Feeding lories is a lot of fun,5.0,,"I visited the Jurong Bird Park with my 20-yr old sister and parents (both aged 50+). All of us thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I've visited zoos with birds and bird parks before, but this one is just the best. There are bird shows at specific times each day. Grab a pamphlet with the directions and showtimes before you start exploring the park. Plan your timings for the shows and do not miss them. The high-flyers show was fantastic. Do not miss the Lory Loft where you can feed to lories. You must buy bird food for 2$ from a stall there to feed the lories. The parrots paradise was wonderful with parrots in all Colours and sizes. It would take you 4 -5 hours to look around the park. You can choose a tram ride if you prefer not to walk. Wear comfortable running shoes if you are going to walk."
,,Better than expected,5.0,,This Bird Park exceeded our expectations. If you like birds then this is a must do attraction whilst in Singapore
,,Impressive Bird Park,5.0,,"The family and I were all very impressed with the Jurong Bird park. Full of colourful species, lushous gardens and enclosures. The high flyers show is a must if you pay the park a visit. Only negative was the bongo burgers for lunch on the way out, give that a miss."
,,Good 45th birthday celebrations!,4.0,,"We went to the bird park on 3rd Jan when it was their 45th birthday celebration and so we recd a 45% discount on the entry ticket, so worth it! nice shows and bird exhibits and feeding, Children loved it, so did we!! Don't miss the breeding and incubation centre, so informative and such cute baby birds there. Re: Transport there is a free shuttle bus to a closeby MRT"
,,Recommend Lunch with the parrots!,5.0,,"The lunch with the parrots was amazing, very audience friendly, with the opportunity to buy paintings drawn by the birds. On the day we went the power had gone out, so we did wait a bit to get photos taken, but we were not in a hurry so were not bothered by the delay."
,,Good experience with birds,4.0,,You can feed lory and take a picture together. There are so many and various birds.. The tram is convenient to go around the large park under the hot weather.
,,Short 2.5 hours visit,4.0,,"Visited Jurong Bird Park when I was very young and came back again after almost 2 decades. Much probably has changed and it was a great, but slightly tiring experience due to the pace as a result of limited time available and the heat during our visit.
The park offered many varieties of animals in different setting with great explanations.
We didn't use any of the eatery or watched any of the shows, however. All in all, it was a great visit, but make sure dress comfortably with good shoes and comfy clothes"
,,Best Bird Park!!,5.0,,"This place is very large and different types of birds can be seen here. Large and different color Parrots are not to be missed. ""Quincy"" is the parrot which speaks and sings too, you can see her in the show. Tram ride is available to see the complete park. A must visit place with youngsters and kids."
,,Suggested only if you are a bird lover.,3.0,,"There are lots of varieties of birds here. But I personally am not too much into birds. So I didnot want to watch all different species of birds except the ones which were famous.

There were shows like lunch with parrots and a bird show too. Bird show was good. We didnot try lunch with parrots as we arrived late.

There was a separate section for penguins . Penguins were kept in an artificial ice cove. A man went and fed penguins morning and evening .

There was a man-made water fall which was highlight of the park. It was very pretty. On our way back from waterfall, we fed some birds with worms which they charged .

People who are not much into birds can give it a miss because Singapore has lot more to do!"
,,A beautiful bird park,5.0,,"I've been to many bird parks around the world and I can say by far this is one of the best. The grounds are clean and green, and there are many gorgeous birds to see. They are very well looked after and seemed quite happy in their environments. The park is quite big and you need a few hours to walk around. There is a little train for a small additional cost if you get tired, but need to pay this on arrival. The waterfall aviary is beautiful, and the lorikeets were so much fun to feed. We went by taxi from the city, and had no problem getting one home again. The high flyer show was great and the birds were enjoying the attention. Young children would love this."
,,Enjoy the Show,4.0,,The park is a beautiful space and home to many exceptional tropical birds. we especially enjoyed watching the show that the staff puts on daily.
,,Awesome place,4.0,,Don't miss the high flyer show. It is awesome. We ran out of time so could not cover the whole park. However whatever we could cover blew us off our feet. The birds of Paradise section has some beautiful birds. The tropical aviary really transfers you to another world with birds of all sizes and colors all around!
,,Needs Improvement,3.0,,"Monday visit to the park on 21st December. Park entrance was beautiful with all the flora and fauna display. Noticed that most of the birds display are have overgrown vegetation. I don't know whether is was meant to be that way as to simulate a wild habitat, but as park visitors we are not able to see birds clearly. Disappointed! If we want to see birds in their wild natural habitat, we can just visit nature reserved to see. Remember that it's a park and we pay good money to see the birds exhibit."
,,Jurong Bird park Singapore,5.0,,Excellent Bird park to visit bit away from the main city but is excellent place to visit as we can see lot of tropical birds in open spaces and there are shows with birds which are trained well to perform acts. Passes can be booked on line and can be collected at the counter as well. there is a roaming train with thin the park which helps take you in different segments of the park
,,World of birds,4.0,,Very lovely staff the way they take care of the birds are tooo good. We can feel the love they have for them. Way to go. Dont miss the shows they have.
,,Colourful,5.0,,"Great day out one of the oldest and most famous attractions in Singapore the beautiful gardens the gorgeous colourful birds and the gardens , bird shows great day out foe everybody"
,,Excellent and kids loved it,5.0,,So many species of birds and variety and the shows were excellent. My wife actually volunteered and had a vulture on her arm. Amazing!!!!
,,Green paradise..,4.0,,"Extremely pleasant and cool bird park with many varieties of birds. The Bird show in the evening was thrilling and very well organised. The flamingoes were super, and Lori Loft just cannot be missed. Worth the visit!"
,,Awesome Day Outing,5.0,,"My son had a great time at the Jurong Bird park. There are plentiful birds and most of them can be exotic and never before seen. I especially loved the Different kinds of Horn Bills and also the aviary where you can really get upclose to the birds. The shows that occur at various points in the day are a must watch, especially the eagles and owls show!"
,,A great place to visit,5.0,,I am always proud of our Bird parks but if have more package or discount for local will be great as it is getting a little ex for us Singaporeans to visit plus only can use taxi to visit with family.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,A life time experience. I love all the bird show. Cage full of colorful birds. cranes are wonderful.
,,Birds were Stunning!,4.0,,Surprisingly not so warm weather place. Stunning birds to see and in close range. The park is located in an easy accessible location and out of centre of Singapore. Spending 2 to 3 hours easily and stop.
,,Amazingly colourful encounters,5.0,,"Love this place so much that I have ended-up visiting it almost 5 times in one year. Lorikeet feeding is my favorite part. There are innumerable kinds of birds and we usually cannot see all of them in one go. The walking aviary of southeast asian birds is really cool.The macaws and cockatoos are simply awesome, though I always feel sad to see such intelligent birds in cages, though, to their credit the Jurong bird park keeps them in huge ones. The Singapore zoo seems a bit dull after watching these vibrant, rainbow-like feathery kinds. Do not miss it!"
,,Worst possible service,1.0,,"These people need to take lessons at a well managed park! Ridiculous and unnecessary queue just to buy a ticket. 3 people working, 1 cash register in operation for the usual ticket buying family. They'd then spend endless time acting as an info center while the queue grew out to the street!

Inside it's just as bad with insufficient trams running. Plan to wait....

Birds and some of the exhibits are of course nice to see.

Doesn't have to be like this and it's time JBP gets like the rest of Singapore and puts some planning in place!"
,,Well worth it,5.0,,"We loved the bird park! Is quite a way out - we went from the zoo. Well worth seeing all of the wonderful birds they have. If you like birds I would recommend going here, is amazing!"
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,Great chance to see so many different species of birds and wildlife.Some fantastic colours on view.Enjoyed it.
,,Worth the combo with the zoo,4.0,,"After two years of trips to Singapore, we (me, wife and 2 daughters) finally visited the bird park. We used the combo pass with the zoo to save a few dollars. We arrived around 0900 and spent 5 active hours. I rate the bird park a 4 because the zoo is a 5."
,,Much better than expected,4.0,,"With a few exceptions where birds are kept in old enclosures that seem too small and are difficult to see into, this is generally a wonderful place, with a couple of massive aviaries where the birds are free and have plenty of space. If you love birds it's worth a visit."
,,Fascinating place to see Beautiful Birds,5.0,,Great place to take the family. Green and luscious with lots of beautiful birds. We loved the giant avery.
,,great bird park,4.0,,The bird park is great. The selection of birds is fantastic and most have very large areas to fly about.
,,Jurong Bird Park- Singapore,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park- Singapore
One of the must visits when in Singapore if with children
- Can spend hours walking around
- Eating options
- Very affordable
- Kids can keep coming back ( great option to get a pass)
- Clean - Well maintained

Can spend whole day if you wish
else keep 2-3 hours minimum ."
,,"the owls, penguins and little parrot",4.0,,if you have never been there yet you should go. there are so many birds and facts for you to discover here. i especially like the owls and penguins. and there is one place you can get really close withe the parrot.
,,Worth a half a day tour,4.0,,The place as such is quite far from the city . Nearest MRT is Jurong east . You will have to take a bus from there to boon lay. Take a tramp as you might feel exhausted walking all the way around the park. Must see show is high flyer .
,,Encounter with exotic birds,5.0,,"This attraction is one of my favourites in Singapore for its wide variety of exotic birds that you cannot lay your eyes off! A highly educational and fun trip for the kids and adults alike like the zoo. Enjoyed the various bird enclosures and the enjoyable shows too- try to catch them. From a tete to tete with the talking parrots, snaps with the various birds, photographing them and seeing them perform was really satisfying. A proud peacock even posing for you in all its finery was like the icing on the cake! Dont give this one a miss. Leave early as its far from the main city and save on travelling time but opying to go by cab/ coach. Its cheaper to buy tickets for all the3- 4 parks together if you plan on seeing all or most of them."
,,Revisit,4.0,,It was 20 years past since I last visited the park. It was one of my favourite place in Singapore and is the best bird park I been. Place is still the same except is smaller.
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,The variety of birds is astounding the special shows are a worth watching don't miss it. Take the battery car ride as it is difficult to cover by foot if you have small kids around. The eatery near the entrance serves Indian Biryani (Veg and Chicken) which is quite good.
,,Visit to Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"We went to Jurong Bird Park on 21 Dec 2015. It opens every day from 8.30 am to 6 pm.

I have not been there since visiting it when I was in primary school. I remembered doing some projects that require us to investigate more about birds and that would be a wonderful place for learning to take place.

The tickets cost as shown below (at normal rate):
Admission Fee $28.00 (Per Adult) $18.00 (Per Child(3 - 12 years old))
$12.00 (Per Senior Citizen who is a Singaporean or Singapore PR)

It was an enriching experience. We managed to visit enclosures such as 'Hornbills and Toucans', 'Lory Loft' (where you can feed the lories) and 'Waterfall Aviary'.

We went to the bird shows at 3 pm (High Flyers Show) and 4 pm (Hawk Arena). There is also a wet area for kids to enjoy getting wet!

There is a tram that brings you to 3 different stations in the Park. Hope you can visit them when you are here in Singapore.

The only issue I hope that the management may implement is to reduce the prices of food and beverages in the Park and in other tourist attractions as well. I had the premium 'Going Bananas' (close to Banana Split) ice cream for nearly $18. *Gasp!*
With the reduction in prices, more visitors will puchase their food and beverages and this should help to add to the Park's coffers for maintaining the Park and provide nutrients to the birds under their charge."
,,Best bird park,5.0,,It's one of the best bird park I have seen . All the birds are unique well cared for the nets are so high that birds get enough space to fly . The amphitheater which shows the bird show is spectacular. Every time I visited Singapore I have visited this place . The parrots the small yellow birds which sit on your shoulder is fun for children . Make sure you also visit the other safari in the same complex they have a restaurant which serves Indian food . I think it's the best place in Singapore. Nature at its best
,,All kinds of birds,4.0,,First time to Jurong Bird Park and we see different variety of birds. You can get very close to the parrots and feed them for a fee. There is a kids water playground which my kid enjoyed. The journey to the birdpark is very far at Boon Lay but easily accessible by MRT and bus.
,,Absolutely Magnificent,5.0,,"I have not visited many bird parks, but visiting this one was a blast.
At the entrance, they allow you to take a free picture with parrots on your hands. That was nice!
Overall, the park is full of colorful birds.
If you plan to visit, please check the timetable for bird shows that hold regularly in the park at certain times of the day. Birds do activities that might amaze you too.
Overall, highly recommended."
,,The Best Bird Park Ever?,5.0,,"Cannot imagine that there is a superior bird park anywhere. If you think you might want to visit, then definitely visit."
,,Bird park,5.0,,The kids enjoyed it especially the shows. Recommended educational experience for the young and old. You can go around in the tram and see all the different birds in their natural surrounding.
,,WONDERFUL JURONG BIRD PARK,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a landscaped park in Singapore and is. It can be called bird zoo as there are specimens of bird life from around the world, including flamingos. It is claimed to be the world's largest bird park in terms of the number of birds. The bird show everyday at the amphitheatre is a truely nice experience, not to be missed at any cost!!"
,,A place to return to,5.0,,"My family enjoyed the exposure we've had with the animals. However, it seems that my dad enjoyed it the most because he purchased membership in said bird park. He's a photography enthusiast and found the bird park to be conducive to honing his skills. Great subjects!"
,,Jurong birds park,5.0,,This is the best bird park I have visited . Go early to enjoy the bird show and note the feeding time . Go around in the tram and get down on different enclosure .
,,Awesome time for kids,5.0,,"Hi am a frequent visitor to JBP as I love birds. My father has a bird farm with African parrots and cocktails, since young I have been with them. So I happen to visit often. Also I got the feather member ship program for me and kid which helps you to visit the JBP any time with unlimited entry for 1 yr with one time pay. Offer ends by Dec 2015.
If you can start early and reach there by 9.30 am. It's good. You can catch both the shows on time and take a tour to see the flamingos, wide range of African parrots, cockatoo etc. Also can see the eagle family, toucan, horn bills and ostrich. I think the dark world which contains owl and barn are under maintenance.
For children they will love the water play area which is maintained well with good wash room facilities. I suggest kids to have swim wear. After play they can have shower which is open near female rest rooms. There is a separate children's bathroom with restroom.
Don't miss the lorries feeding session. For 3 dollar you get a cup of feed. Once you have the feed in your hand , you will be surrounded by the little lorries. Care to be taken with children as birds sit on head , shoulders other than hand. Be careful with the birds toe nails while feeding.
Have a photo session with parrots if you do like it. Try to stay hydrated if you want to tour around. You can also opt for tram ride. Wheel chair and prams are available on rental for elderly and kids.
The nearest Mrt is boon lay which has bus 194 straight to JBP."
,,The shows are not to be missed,4.0,,"The bird shows are simply amazing.
It is a little bit of a drag getting to this place - though it is actually well connected.
But once you are there, the shows are really good.
Singapore rain can interfere with your plans but still this place is worth it."
,,Unique Park - especially great for kids,5.0,,"My kids loved the park. Especially the the pavilion with parrots. It is really exciting to feed them by hands when they fly over your head and sit on your arms. The waterfall was outstanding - beautiful oasis in a big city. We also enjoyed the shows with the pets.
Flamingos are our favorites!"
,,A GOOD HALF DAY OUTING,3.0,,"My wife and I together with my sis in law and niece had a half day outing to this bird park. We have been there many times. It is a good place for family outing. However, I felt this time round, there seems to be less to see. The bird show was very brief. We also did not see visitors feeding the parrots which I found very interesting to do in the previous visits. May be it was because it was drizzling a bit. Visitors should do this and take photos if it is still on."
,,Not worth it.....Too far out of Central Singapore & Viewing Caged Birds Not Too Enjoyable.,2.0,,"Been to other "" zoo-like"" parks and this one was disappointing. Most the birds are in cages and hard to see ( from the fast-moving Tram)...Perhaps better if you walk, but I doibt it.

Vultures out numbered other birds...except Pelicans and Flamingos...but truly...not worth your precious time, if you're on a limited time schedule...Go to the Botanical Gardens instead."
,,Some spectacular birds but some cages made it difficult to see the birds,4.0,,The shows were great to watch and the variety of birds excellent. However some cages were quite old and bars thick making it difficult to take photos etc. Apparently the park is moving closer to the zoo soon so there maybe new cages for some species. Some of the walk through aviaries were great as was flamingo areas.
,,Not too bad,3.0,,"Been here a few times. The only sad thing about my last visit is that many places are under renovation so we were not able to visit many of the birds, like the owls, the peacock family.

It is best to always bring an umbrella when visiting this place since it's either too warm or it suddenly starts to rain."
,,Must do for bird lovers,4.0,,"Great day out, Lory loft waterfall aviaryand bird shows not to be missed. Best go during week when tram rides are unlimited."
,,go there if you just went to singapore only not singapore and malaysia,3.0,,there is no point in going to jurong bird park if you will go to malaysia kuala lampur also with singapore because kl bird park is much larger and with a lot of birds variety much more than this bird park also because you are in singapore so the ticket for sure will be much expensive than malaysia. for me i went there and did not enjoy my visit there but enjoyed a lot with both my two visits to kl bird park.
,,Awesome place,5.0,,Must visited place..if kids r there they ll loved it..just entered n ask show time first then go for tram ride..n back to right time for a show..awesome show must see show..there r 2 shows 1 parrot show n 1eagle show..loved show n enjoyed it..rest there r many species of bird which make ur eyes open
,,"At the far end of the island, but well worth a visit",5.0,,"The bird park is ... a top-quality bird park. To visit on a budget, take the MRT to Boon Lay then change for a bus or short taxi ride. The bird park will soon move to a new location, so see the original before it's gone."
,,"Amazing, Beautiful Bird Park - Must Visit",5.0,,"This is an excellent place to spend a whole day watching birds and reading and listening to and about birds of different sizes, shapes and colors.

The closest MRT station is Boon Lay. You will need transport from Boon Lay to the park - regular connecting buses are available.

The park has an entry fee - slightly steep, but well worth it.

The park is divided into many parts, each devoted to a certain theme like 'birds of prey', 'lori loft', 'spoonbills', 'swans', 'flamingo lake', 'parrot paradise', etc.

You also have shows where birds display their talents, guided by trained handlers. The shows I saw were 'High Flyers' and 'Kings of the Skies'.

A visit to the Waterfall Aviary is worth it.

You can click photos to your heart's content.

By the way, it is really great to see so much nature packed into an urban space like Singapore - also that it continues to be maintained so well."
,,Great place for a day out,5.0,,Half a day is needed for Jurong bird park. It's huge. So many different kinds of bird. Take a guided trip of the park so that you don't miss anything. Must in Singapore.
,,Bored,2.0,,"Never been so bored visiting an attraction. Nothing special about the place, was just 1 big park as you walk and walk. Nothing worth mentioning and thus a waste of money."
,,Waste of Time and Money - especially the Train!,1.0,,"We visited on the 26th of November 2015. It cost $28 each to enter. We upgraded our entry to include the train ride around the park, this cost $33 each. I thought this was a lot of money but gave it a go anyway. Top tip of the day- train ride a waste of money! Jumped on the train, got to the next station and then was told that it was terminating. Walked up to the next stop but found that there was that many people waiting, we would've been lucky to get on the 2nd train to arrive. We were told walking the park in total would be 1.7km and that's what we did in the end. The variety of birds were disappointing - Pelicans are beautiful birds but are very common. Saw the flamingoes, saw the bird breeding program, a couple of bird enclosures and these were ok. We saw the end of the bird show and again I would rate it as just ok. Just found this park lacked variety, was too expensive and was overrated."
,,Very educational for the kids,5.0,,"This is one trip that our kids will always remember. They were very happy to see that the birds were well-cared. Great for them to see some ecosystem.

As it is a long trek up and around, it is a big relief to find and cool down in the resting areas."
,,A normal One,3.0,,"Its a normal one. We went to the theatre show. It was good but not comparable to others. It,s not at all a rainy day activity"
,,Great setout,4.0,,Jurong Bird Park was hard to get to using public transport train then transfer to bus but not having been there for about 20 years well worth the trouble but it pissed down rain so didn’t get full advantage.What we saw on the complimentary train circuit was enough to make us want to return
,,"When you love birds, you will love this park.",5.0,,This park offers great views of colourful birds in a natural setting; you can wander on various places amidst flying birds without being disturbed by fences.
,,Beautiful Birds,4.0,,"If you love or even like birds you won't be disappointed. The park has hundreds or varieties of birds of any color you can imagine and from small to very large. Many of the birds are in open areas with hedges or fences to keep people out (I don't know why they don't just fly away). There are also many that are kept in cages and my favorite part...two large giant bird cages that you walk into and see the birds up close and personal. The birds are accustomed to people so as you walk around, the bird more or less just ignore you....except for one blue one that kept following my wife. This was excellent way to spend the day.

Visited the park with my wife....we went to the park and returned to our hotel via taxi...MRT doesn't really go close and buses are a hassle for tourists. It was warm, so go early. Also, lots of kids were there from various schools and lots of families. Weekdays probably a little less crowded."
,,Amazing shows,5.0,,2 hours attraction.. dont miss the bird shows.. tram ride is useful to cover all park.. dont miss photo opportunities ..
,,Exceptionally good,5.0,,"Simply outstanding, must must must visit. Kids will love it, elders will enjoy it. Don't miss the high flyers show."
,,Great day in Birdpark,5.0,,This is one of the best park I ever visited around the World.Its a great place for Children to experience the bird life and to get more knowledge about birds. The open air aviary let you and your children feed the parrots right from your hand.Excellent bird show will blow your mind.Also the children water and play is a best place for Children to cool down don't forget to bring along a swim suit and towel .Its better to bring some food and water as the food and water is slightly expensive inside the park.
,,One of it's kind...,4.0,,"An attraction on the western part of Singapore which can be reached via Cab or MRT/Bus(green line till Boon Lay,Bus 194).
Whole family will enjoy a trip to this Bird Sanctuary in Singapore, which also get some upgrading this year.Prepare yourself for some travel time of 30mins Taxi-60 mins Public transport,est."
,,Such a variety of birds in 1 park !,5.0,,"The park is beautifully landscaped.It's such a pleasure to walk on the pathways through a variety of plants and trees, something Singapore does so well! We loved the learning centre where you can learn about the breeding of some of the birds.We could watch the preparation of food,the incubation of eggs as well as a bird trying to peck it's way out of an egg....amazing! There were a lot of facts to read and learn which was really informative.
All the birds had so much space in their enclosures, such a relief to see the way they are being treated.The flamingo's and the waterfall were our favourite!
An experience that can't be missed! Great for all ages."
,,Mistake if you skip this Singapore,5.0,,Opportunity to see various Birds closely.... Their live shows... Feed small parrots... hang out with birds on your shoulders !! .... Fun to be around....
,,birds of a feather flock with us!,4.0,,"this was our second time to this lovely park, it was Me, my husband and our 4 year old son.
being our second time we basically skipped all the water birds because they smelled like fish which was not our sons thing! lol
anyways, this place is great for families and amazing Photo opportunities for photographers! the bird show around 4PM i highly recommend ! just because the show they put on is fun and musical. also some talented Amazon parrots there

bring an umbrella because not much cover is available !"
,,A Kaleidoscope of Colour,5.0,,"This open concept bird park enables you to get close to those feathered friends. The sanctuary houses some of the most colourful avian species with over 5000 birds that span across 400 species. With various exhibits, feeding & encounter sessions you'll literally be taking flight with the colourful array of birdlife within its natural habitat. There is a great water park area designed for kids, but perfect for the whole family to cool down from the heat. the Hop on trams take the sweat out of the feet."
,,Must visit attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"We visited Jurong Bird park this month with family. It's a well preserved nature reserve with lots of birds. Particularly we liked the feeding sessions of various birds where we can feed them with our hands and click pictures - especially the kids love this
And above that threw were shows like the vulture and Eagles etc
Overall this is highly recommended site to visit in the beautiful city of Singapore"
,,Short Stay on SIA Package,3.0,,"While a lovely setting, the park has a lot of thick tree growth which is great for the birds but harder to actually see bird life, particularly near the waterfall area.

It is a little way from the city by public transport so allow about an hour if travelling by MRT and the a short bus trip to the bird park.

We didn't have long to visit, so staying longer may have made this a better tourist attraction for us. Also coming from Australia and doing many bush walks, we are probably a bit spoilt for seeing bird populations in the wild."
,,Very nice place for an outing with kids,5.0,,"Singapore's maginificient planning and cleanliness shines through at the Singapore bird park as well. The timed attractions were a big hit with kids and even my mom enjoyed the trip. Convenient tram rides, food & beverage and helpful ushers made our trip memorable. Great collection of birds and they look well taken care of."
,,Worth visiting for a close encounter with birds,5.0,,A good experience where birds are so near to you.. You can feed the birds also and if you are lucky it will sit on you also for some nice photos.. Really enjoyed a lot.
,,Great entertainment,5.0,,This is our second visit to Jurong. Birds from every country. The free flying displays are amazing. My favourites are the Macaws and the pink Flamingos. The Avery Waterfall is spectacular and a great photo opportunity. Lots of birds just wandering & flying in a massive open space. We took our grandson who was enthralled all day. A must visit while in Singapore.
,,Planet of the Birds,5.0,,Some of the best birds I had ever seen in many of the bird parks I've visited.In keeping with the array of colours that characterizes Singapore. Loved the monorail that takes you through the park. The parrot and bird show is one of it's kind in the world. I still have my two pet parrot souvenirs to remind me. Incredible tourist attraction never to be missed.
,,Must see for the people of all ages......Superstar birds,5.0,,Shows are awesome...Pink flamingos.....egg hatching centres.......lori feeding.......altogether an awesome experience for all ages. Penguin feeding was again a highlight. I was amazed by the environment these birds live in....so quite and green Love the place...will surely come again
,,Excellant plus plus,5.0,,I visited several time and it enjoyed my mind. All the animals are so lovely . You can pass a nice time without thinking of the world
,,Good fun for kids,4.0,,The bird show was good and so was the travel across the bird park. Recommended for everybody. The bus arrangement helps one to travel.
,,Worth Visiting Bird Park,5.0,,This is very nice Bird Park in Singapore. This is very nicely arranged and having very vast collection.
,,Stunning bird shows,5.0,,The highlight of you stay will definitely be the shows. Birds performing a variety of tasks will awe you. Excellent for families. But the place is not easily accessible by metro.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Great bird park, fascinating. The free train around the complex was great and the bird show quite brilliant"
,,close to the birds,4.0,,"large gardens with some massive aviary cages where the birds fly free in the native bush growing in the cages. Walkways at treetop hight allow uninterrupted viewing of the birds some of which will visit you. A wide variety of birds kept in more conventional aviaries, all very informative and interesting."
,,Mesmerising & Magical! A real treat for kids and adults alike!,5.0,,A must go attraction and worth repeating if you can! Get the annual pass as it pays for itself after the second visit. Best kept secret to wind down after a full day in the heat is the water park right at the far back. The kids love it and so will you! Highly recommend the High Fliers show (including a parrot the sings!) and other shows. Best to pace your day around these shows and feeding sessions. Beautifully set up and an all year round attraction! Don't miss the highest indoor waterfall - a really cool spot especially on hot days!
,,Huge and very informative,5.0,,Jurong Bird Park is a wonderful way to spend half a day (or maybe more) in Singapore. It has a huge variety of birds. and various programs keep on happening at different times of the day. Must visit - specially if you are travelling with young children.
,,The best attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"We spent more than half a day at this wonderful place. Birds of all feathers, colours, nature are all here. Its wonderful to walk through the aviaries and the food at the waterfall cafe was awesome. We managed to catch up on two shows in the morning, which were excellent. Definitely recommended."
,,Very cool,5.0,,Awesome variety of birds to view. Great shows and the staff are very knowledgeable. You can also feed the birds although there was no staff Manning that area when I visited
,,Bird Lovers Paradise,5.0,,Jurong Bird Park never fails to enthrall visitors. The park is home to a wide species of colourful birds. Proper planning would ensure all of the wonderful shows and feeding activities are not missed. Not to miss the lori loft feeding and the bird show at the amphitheatre which the kids would definitely enjoy.
,,A great trip!,5.0,,"An outstanding experience. The displays and the shows were amazing! The locations maps are self-explanatory and hence getting around is easy. The staff is knowledgeable, enthusiastic and fun."
,,Must visit,5.0,,One can spend one complete day in this park. Many unique and beautiful species of the bird can been in this park. They have train inside park which keeps moving around park every 15 mins. There are also great bird shows which no one should miss. All show timings and schedule can be easily avail in the park.
,,Best bird park in singapore,5.0,,This is the best bird park in singapore with lots of exotic birds parrots etc . Good to go with kids so they can enjoy nature and bird life worth a visit at least once
,,Bird Park stands the test of time,5.0,,"The Jurong Bird Partk has been around for a long time, but it is still fascinating. As with most such things, its the raptors -- birds of prey -- that inspire awe. Singapore is occasionally slammed for a lack of tourist attractions. If so, they haven't seen the bird park. The commentary is an interesting exposition on the birds and their lives."
,,Beautiful Park,5.0,,"My son celebrated his 3rd Birthday in the park and it was a blast! Very friendly staff, good food from the restaurants inside and i was amazed by the varieties of birds that they have."
,,Birds By The Hundreds!,5.0,,"Very glad we went to Jurong Bird Park, a great place to spend a morning or afternoon walking through the many free flight aviaries that abound this great park. Very easy to get to via the MRT and a connecting bus, but try to go before it gets to hot later in the day. Food is usual tourist prices of course, but you can take your own snacks if you want. Well worth the cost of the entry, which was pretty reasonable, a must do when visiting Singapore."
,,Not very enthusiastic,3.0,,You need to check your own interest and enthusiasm before planning to visit this attraction. Post the attraction i realized that it was not of my interests so i had an average time.
,,Plan a whole day for Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"Very interesting to see different kinds of birds. Jurong Bird Park is relatively big, so plan your day well, would say good half of the day can be spent here. Bring your camera and lots of water, as the walk around the park can be very tiring, although there was a hop on, hop off tram going around the park anyway."
,,Jurong Bird Park - Left gasping for more,3.0,,Found the place over rated and expensive. The species of birds were also not many and the tram experience was a drudgery. Bird Show as an attraction was the only saving grace.
,,close bird encounter,5.0,,"beautiful bird park, very friendly for kids. entrance is a little pricey i think we paid 27 singaporean dollars per head but there's a discount for children and senior citizens. just bring any valid ID. BUS ride is needed if you go for public transportation which during holidays gets reallyy packed!! we went on a weekend holiday on a sunday and the bus line was soo long and the bus was soo packed as well as expected. the Park rangers were very friendly and accommodating. i was impressed at how close a tourist can go to see and experience the birds in their habitat. there is a free bird show at around 11. tip: stay at the bottom in the center so you will have a very high chance of being picked to volunteer for some parts of the show. i really enjoyed the show. made me realize the value of birds and how they are rapidly diminishing with fast deforestation globally. outfit: wear comfortable shoes, a hat, bring water with you because its very hot. bring extra clothes for children (there's an exclusive park for children and it looked very fun with all the water bucket falling and fountains, slides etc.. which made me wish to be a kid once more). there are a few restaurants available around but it is also ok to bring your own food. water fountains, and toilets are available too and well kept. will i come back to this place? definitely and ill bring my nephews and nieces along :)"
,,Best Bird Park,5.0,,"Visited this park with Family and you could see variety of birds at one place, great experience and learning. Need to give 4-5 hours for this park visit. We love this place and would visit again, when in Singapore."
,,we loved it,5.0,,"Great setting for an amazing collection. Birds were nearly always visible in every cage, even though there was appropriate foliage provided."
,,Introducing kids to Birds,5.0,,"When you live in metropolitan cities, it is difficult to explain to children about the variety of winged species inhabiting this planet. One cannot go beyond the homely sparrows and the noisy crows. But the saviour comes in the form of Jurong Bird Park. The birds are caged, which is a sad thing. But it is better to be cage and living rather than the fate which awaits them outside: extinction. We saw many rare species of birds. Saw the conservation efforts and the hatchery. We saw myriad varieties of parrots, cockatoos and swans and pelicans and penguins. The kids were thrilled to see the birds which they had hitherto seen only on Discovery / National Geographic. A must visit for all those travelling to Singapore."
,,Best bird park,4.0,,"I visited this place on 2011 with my family... This place was so good for children to learn about many kinds of birds... We can interactive with bird, feeding bird directly it was great experience... We love to visit here again, when in Singapore..."
,,A Wing of Paradise,4.0,,"On our 3 day MRT Tourist Pass, we took the MRT on the EW line to Joo Koon station and found that we should have got off at Boon Lay (EW27). There is a bus (194) that is specific to and from the bird park.
We paid the additional S$5/person for use of the tram/trolley to get around the park as it involves some hills and the weather is hot and humid. Take note of the special display shows which are interesting.You can walk the areas nearby the entrance but the rest involves some distance. Yes the birds are varied, plentiful and although caged seem to have a well fitted out area albeit some seemed on the small size for especially some of the larger birds.
For S$28/person is takes a minimum 2 hours and is good for everyone although wildlife and bird lovers would find this a must."
,,Only for Kids,3.0,,"We visited this place with my family. There are a lot of sections with different birds, and it is a good experience to look at different kinds of birds.

You can take a walk around the whole park or else if short on time, just take the tram and visit the main areas as well as enjoy the show."
,,Colorful birds,5.0,,I have never come across such a lovely place. Greenery all around. Beautiful colorful birds. Endless friendly birds and speechless bird show
,,Great for viewing birds,4.0,,"Spent morning here , got too hot after midday 2 shows are good, lots of birds we don't see in NZ, $15 taxi fare from orchard road to park, quicker than train"
,,Nice,4.0,,"A little out of the way but a nice way to spend the morning. My 4 year old loved the bird show and the water play areas. Be prepared to walk around the park even if you take the buggy ride as it stops only at 3 areas. Carry plenty of water and snacks, the latter especially if you are vegetarian."
,,Nice place!,4.0,,Its a good place to visit. If you do not miss the bird shows that they have! what a wonderful experience & sight.
,,Birds galore,4.0,,The Lory pavilion brings beautiful birds to you. Many others in open areas and good shows with various species through the day
,,"“Fun with feather friends for Kids""",4.0,,"Took the tram ride to the 1st stop then walked to the 2nd stop . Watched the Pelican Show which was very interesting. Then hopped on the Tram again and did the full circle of the park again. Loved the Toucans and the Hornbills, kids will love the shows, specially the morning shows with so many birds flying around the audiences. Kids zone is also another attraction inside the bird park.Feed the birds at Lory Loft, feed penguins, attend a show, and bring your swimmers for the waterplay area."
,,I'm back.. Again!,5.0,,"#Howtogethere#
I have been here many times. In the past I just in & out by Taxi which cost me approx 55-60S$ round trip from Novena.

This is my first that use public transportation. I'm start from red and change to green line at City Hall roll out @ Boon Lay St. Exit B and walk thru Jurong point mall to Bus Int go to gate no. 8 and get on bus no. 251. It's only 1 stop 11 mins drop me right in front of the park. After you cross the road from place you drop off to catch same bus on opposite side. No. 251 will bring you back at Jurong point mall as same spot.

#PlacetoEat#
This place have 5 choices for food. There's lunch buffet, local foods, sandwiches, burger etc. Two of them is outside the entrance gate. If you want to go out to eat and come back in ask gate staff to stamp on your wrist. I went to Hawk Cafe for lunch and tried chicken rice. It was average at best.

#TheshowIlove#
11.45 a.m. birds show
4.00 p.m. Hawk show

#Feeding#
10.30 a.m. & 3.30 p.m. Penguin feeding.

We always enjoyed our time here in JBP. Lots of birds. The place is well take care. Toilets were clean. Staffs spoke good English and quite friendly.

Tips : Buy tickets from agency counter (near mrt Chinatown, Farrell Park, Lavender). If you're tourist you could buy E tickets from agency as well. They will sent you an email and you print it out. I got 2 tickets for 41$ including tram ride (full price was 66S$ if buy at the park) . If you're holding work pass and have posb can go to their website and get 30% off. Master card for none work pass will get only 10% off. The best deal is agency website /counter. In the meantime you can also buy other attractions from them eg. Flowers dome+Cloud Forest for S$19 (adult) and etc.

Enjoy!"
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"We went there bringing our 3 yr old and our 8 month old baby. Both were amazed with the bird show. Lots to see, baby facilities were available on site so nothing to worry. Snack stalls were available throughout the park so you wont go hungry. Try getting the combo tickets if you are planning to go to more than one park so you could save some money too."
,,jurong its just amazing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5.0,,"when I visited jurong I visited to see all the birds and my experience was just amazing and all the surrounding are clean and its good for whom who love the nature and birds and specially children will also like it
I would definetly recommend this place for those who are visiting singapore"
,,Bird lovers paradise,5.0,,"Jurong bird park is a nice attraction and can be covered in half a day. Kings of the sky show is good. There are not much birds around and renovation work also is going on. I tried Lory feeding and was fun. The charges for souvenir photos are too high and should be reduced, but hardly anyone can miss having one with birds. Overall, Jurong is a must watch for families"
,,Nice,4.0,,"I enjoyed this zoo it was nice zoo, hard to take good pics from cage. Weather always hot two times I go jurong just not my luck:-D"
,,Great for Family!,4.0,,"The best bird park ever. Nice environment and trails. Easy to orient around with trams. My family like the Lory feeding area. The performances are fantastic. However, the park is a bit dated and need to be injected with new facades and upgrades."
,,Fun Experience With Kids,4.0,,"We decided on this park over the zoo because it was simpler and both of our kids (ages 2 and 4) love birds. The wide variety of species was impressive, as were the shows. We also took part in the bird feeding inside the Waterfall Atrium. It is a perfect activity for younger kids and since it's donation based it's inexpensive. Warning: if you are grossed out by live mealworms, skip this part! The Waterfall Atrium is very beautiful and fun. We also paid for the lunch buffet/private bird show. It was just okay, but ultimately worth it. This is about a 20-25 minute taxi ride from the city center, and about a 10 minute taxi ride from Jurong Station."
,,Expensive and not many birds,3.0,,"We caught the MRT TO Boon Lay and bus 194 to Jurong Bird Park. I have been to many parks like this and found this one not too good. It was dirty, slippery in the wet and hardly any birds. Cages needed cleaning as well. It was not worth the effort or expense."
,,fabulous day out,5.0,,What a wonderful place for a thoroughly great day out. The bird show was a highlight. The trained Amazon parrot sang songs in 3 different languages. Beautiful surroundings
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,A great day outing. Well worth the visit while in Singapore. A massive amount of Bird Species. We were in time for a Bird show. What an extravaganza. The Horn Bill birds were out of this world. A must see. The grounds even look Botanical.
,,Little disappointed. Average,3.0,,Amongst all the attraction in Singapore if you are running short of time then you can give it a miss. since all the birds are in cage if you are going for a zoo this could be skipped
,,Excellent birds park,5.0,,This is a good place for bird lovers. There is a huge collection of birds in this park. We thoroughly enjoyed half day in this park. The birds kept in this park are collected from all over the world. This is a must to do in singapore.
,,Great fun !,5.0,,"We loved the bird park. The open air aviaries were just huge, and the birds who flew right up and landed on you to eat were great fun.

The big aviary with the waterfall looked magnificent, as did most of the attractions around the park.

It's not a big place by any means, but big enough to spend a few hours with the family. A little out of the way, but worth the visit."
,,Awesome Place,5.0,,"Best place for bird lovers, Hell lot of species. A total one day affair to look at no. of birds at least once.Can be very hot during daytime but need at least 6 hours to enjoy."
,,"World class, a top park , a must to visit",5.0,,This park displays one of the best collection of our feathered friends to be found anywhere. A liesurely stroll through finds happy well cared for birds in well thought out surroundings successfully emulating their wild habitats. This park both educates you and enthralls you and is actively breeding endagered species which is an indication of well settled they are. Highly recomended.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Had a great time here! Make sure you check the show times as they are a must, especially if you have kids. Great collection of birds and we'll laid out"
,,Awesome place for nature lovers,5.0,,Being very literal - Jurong Bird Park is a bird watchers delight! The sheer variety of birds that one encounters at the park and the serenity of the surroundings makes one feel that this is a place that is worth a visit ove and over again.
,,Brilliant day,5.0,,Went there last week.Better than the zoo.The two displays we went to were the best we have ever seen well worth it.Take water as Singapore is always warm.Would visit again.
,,Good place to hangout with birds,4.0,,"Visit to this attraction will take around 3-4 hours. I would recommend to either pick first half (till Lunch) or second half (post Lunch), not in between mainly due to timing of Bird shows. Both shows are worth watching. We have taken the tram pass which helped a lot during hot day. Overall it was a good experience. Only bad part is taxi connectivity, we have to wait close to 30 minutes to get a taxi as this attraction is far from city."
,,Don't miss the High Flyers Show,5.0,,"If you are planning to visit Jurong bird park, make sure that you plan your visit timings around High flyers show. We didn't enjoy kings of skies as much. The aviary behind the restaurant is also worth spending time at."
,,Let's feed the bird,5.0,,Here is the bird park that is outside town and it's the biggest bird park in SEA here is great if you come with family and children they will enjoy with lovely bird that's fun when you feed them by urself
,,Not very impressive,2.0,,"Not to impressed, stuck out to the west of Singapore in industrial land the bird park did not come even close to the advertising. I just felt they were trying too hard to promote an OK bird park as something special. It is not special - interesting perhaps but IMO not worth the effort to get there,"
,,Some of the birds looked stressed,4.0,,We took the mrt and bus here and it was easy to get to. Some of the birds such as the big eagles and toucans were in too small cages- one toucan was flying in circles and hitting the walls of the cage. The waterfall area was a bit run down and I think it needs some upgrades. For $56 I was expecting a bit more.
,,Worth a visit!,4.0,,"We have visited the park several times, and enjoyed our day there. It is very well set out,with lots to see."
,,This is actually one of Singapore's best kept secrets.,5.0,,"It's a Bird Park. Actually, it is an excellent for a walk and a picnic too. There are plenty of wide spaces, lakes and ponds. The walk-in aviaries are an experience to behold. This is actually one of Singapore's best kept secrets."
,,a must visit with kids,5.0,,amazing bird shows and lovely experience ! a lot to roam around and not to miss! kids are going to love the place
,,The World of Birds!,5.0,,"Another popular Singapore attraction which I always wanted to visit. Its a huge place teeming with birds from around the world!
The park opens at 8:30 am so try to reach there as early as possible to avoid queues and crowds (we reached exactly at that time and were first at ticket counter)!

Get the map and try to explore the park on foot, explore every aviary and exhibit. There's a tram too but saw that it doesn't stop at all the exhibits so unless you're only for the show you can hop on it.

Don't miss the shows, its super fun as well as educative especially for kids. Try to watch the different feeding times.

Nearest MRT is Boon Lay from there you need to catch a bus (194/ 251)."
,,Relaxing tram trip with plenty to see,4.0,,"The bird park hosts a couple of shows daily and has an owl house and penguins as well as a beautiful array of birds, water birds and birds of prey. A tram runs through the park and you are able to get off at any station you wish to explore and even to feed the lorikeets. The first section is a little steep (near the kingfishers) so it is better to stay on the tram until the next stop and then walk back downhill if you have mobility issues. Food, photographs and a gift shop are near the entry, as are clean toilets."
,,Amazing bird shows,4.0,,"Please do not miss the bird shows here ...they are simply amazing.. We saw two shows one was at 11am and one at 4pm . I recommend taking the tram tickets, the tram stops at 3 points ..from there you can walk around ..good collection of birds ...do not miss the lorry loft( be prepared to spend 3 dollars for a small bowl of food for the birds at lorry loft only if you have a bowl they come to you and kids pressure into getting it ). There is a small play area for kids so get change of clothes and swimming costumes."
,,Simply awesome,5.0,,"It's one of the best place to go in Singapore.. Reach there by 9am and spend the entire day.. You must attend all the shows specially the High Flyer Show (11 am), Flamingo feeding (1:30 pm), Pelican Chit Chat (2pm), King of the Skies (4pm)... The best part of the park is the Lorry Loft where you can actually feed the birds... You must buy a bird meal for 3 SGD and feed the birds... It's the best memories that you will carry back... Waterfall Aviary is simply awesome and you can spend at least half an hour there from 3pm to 3:30 pm before heading straight for the King of the Skies show at the Hawk arena"
,,Awesome,4.0,,"Loved the place. The highlight is where you take the bird feed in hand & all these beautiful coloured birds swoop down to eat from your hands.

The park itself is huge & very nicely maintained. A hop on hop off vehicle can be taken at a fee to cover the entire place.

Wide variety & excellent photo ops."
,,the best,5.0,,"The Jurong bird park is one of the major attractions of Singapore and a visit to Singapore cannot be complete without visiting this amazing place , which is beyond one's expectations and imagination. The waterfall at the park was mesmerizing. The birds in their serene, man -made natural surroundings are beautiful and if one is a bird lover, it makes one want to be amongst them forever. It was truly a memorable visit to the park."
,,Colourful Birds,3.0,,One can see a variety of colours of birds here. Pretty small park and can be covered in 2-3 hours. Must note the feeding and show timings and plan well.
,,Great attraction,4.0,,One of the Best bird parks I have been to. It has divisions based on the area where the birds naturally belong. has one of the highest manmade waterfalls in the world. Excellent & entertaining shows. Overall Good
,,Endless collection of birds,4.0,,"Alas we did this at the end of our Singapore tour, by then our energy was low. But their amphitheater shows are worth your time. Also they have just too vast collection of birds. This park needs more energy so do not keep it at the end of your trip."
,,We loved it,5.0,,"I am an avid bird watcher of late and hence it was a given I would love it, however, even if you arent into birds this is one place that might just get you started getting interested in the wonderful world of birds. A huge collection of Hornbills and Tucan's and so many other species. The best part is you get to go inside enclosures and get up close to the birds without actually harassing them.

The shows are wonderful, very well maintained enclosures, full of birds at no point did we see an enclosure where we didn't see birds. My 11 year old son absolutely loved it.

Many people had told us to give this park just half a day, however, we gave it a full day and that way we could actually see all the birds with much more peace."
,,Awesome Experience at Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"This place is paradise for bird lovers. In fact, this place will make everyone to fall in love with birds. I haven't seen such a huge collection of birds, specially rarely seen like penguins, vulture family, owls, ostrich, etc. There is a show called ""High Flyers"" which is again very awesome. The place is very far from the city and one has to drop at Boon Lay MRT on the Green line."
,,Great Show,5.0,,Jurong Park visit has been memorable. Staff were very friendly and imparted knowledge about birds and their habitat. Beautiful plants with lush green foliage are good to watch.
,,Awesome,5.0,,I like that we can rent strollers or pull-along carts at a flat rate for the whole day. The experience was awesome. And there was even both dry and wet playgrounds for kids to play in. So remember to bring extra set of dry clothes.

,,An amazing accomplishment in the Zoological Engineering Arts,5.0,,"This is almost worth the cost of the flight to Singapore by itself. Bring your camera, you will get some amazing shots of every different kind of bird. The place is sprawling and expansive. You can spend a whole day here, and not see everything....More"
,,Lots of Birds I'd never seen before,4.0,,"This wasn't quite as exciting as the Zoo in my opinion, but it is definitely something you have to check out if you are a bird lover, or even just an animal lover. There are many different species that are well organized into different habitats....More"

,,Good Shows!,4.0,,They have two good shows. Kids will enjoy it! Got to see birds that you don't get to see very often.
,,Wonderful day for the whole family,5.0,,"The bird park is a beautifully landscaped garden with lots of beautiful birds as inhabitants. Most of the birds are free roaming and even allowed to wander freely among the visitors. I could see some flying up to the tall trees and I wonder how they keep them from flying away! The food and caring love must be excellent at the bird park, that they have no desire to fly away.

The staff are very warm and helpful, even though they have to work all day in the heat and humidity. They always greet you with a smile.

I highly recommend the African penguin feeding at 330pm. For just $2 you get 3 huge sardines to feed the Penguins yourself. But there is limited supply - I estimate the bucket holds no more than 20 sardines. So you have to be quick otherwise the fish runs out. I guess they don't want to overfeed the Penguins.

Remember to bring bathing suits for the kids as there is a lovely water park with 4 water slides and other play areas. Suitable for younger kids as the water level is no more than 1 feet at the deepest pt. There is the ever popular huge water pail which dumps a huge amount of water every 3 mins. There are always screams and laughter here. Adults should bring swim wear too so you can play/supervise the kids.

Enjoy!"
,,enjoyable outing,4.0,,"My second visit to this bird park, and it was just as enjoyable as the first. Its set over a large area so takes some time to get around which in the heat can be a little tiring, so its best to allow plenty of time to take it in and rest in the shade when you can. There are many species of birds in well set out enclosures as well as a couple of 'shows' and although I didn't watch them, some people with children that I spoke to told me the kids loved it."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"i never imagined a place like this could exist where birds present shows. they act and sing, perform tasks. i have seen shows where birds and animals follow the instructions and one always think how they would be trained (treated) but this was amazing. apart from the shows they put up. Its a beautiful place."
,,Waterfall in park,3.0,,There is a nice waterfall in the park - birds fly around it freely. Good experience - enjoyed the visit.
,,the best birdpark in the world,5.0,,"i visited this place twice. it is just wonderfull. everything is done so proffesional and the birdshow is a must see. if they want you to join,put up your hand. great fun for the family."
,,Bird show!,4.0,,The bird show is the highlight of this park - do check for timings at the time of entry into the park. It is advisable not to purchase tickets for tram as you will not be able to see various bird species through that.
,,Pretty Birds everywhere,5.0,,"This is a lovely family day, beautiful birds of all colours, can be very hot so take water and your camera"
,,breather from the concrete jungle,4.0,,"it felt good hearing something natural like birds singing, chirping amidst the concrete jungle like singapore. the shopping might be good but sometimes you need to get away from it all. this is a great place. the flamingoes are quite a spectacle!"
,,Colourful,4.0,,We thoroughly enjoyed the day at the bird park.There so many different types of birds to see and get close to.There are many opportunities to take close up photos of many colourful birds.
,,An ideal location for a family picnic,5.0,,"If you love birds and want to see them in natural surroundings then Jurong Bird Park in Singapore need to be on your must visit list. It's an ideal location for the entire family to spend at least half a day. The birds from different continents are kept in natural surroundings and it is a treat to see & observe them at close quarters. There is an entrance fee of 25 Singapore Dollars and one can take a tram ride inside the park by paying additional 5 dollars. There are bird shows of about 30 to 40 mins at regular intervals. It is also interesting to observe the birds at the feeding time. I loved seeing the flamingos, pelicans, spoonbills & the owls. A visit to the Aviary is an exhilarating experience as it houses one of the tallest man made waterfalls."
,,Must visit,4.0,,"The best from the city for all type of age group,I myself enjoyed a lot feeding the birds and birds show.It was a great experience,beautiful birds and the staff is very nice as well,they are always their to help,if anything needed,In my whole trip to Singapore,I loved being here."
,,Fun with feather friends,5.0,,"Things not to miss in Bird Park: feeding in lofty valley, feeding program in Waterfall avary (with live worms), Pelican chichat, King of the sky show.... The water park is great for kids."
,,Great Park and Bird Show,5.0,,This place is accessible by public transport. Catch the MRT (Green Line) from the city to Boon Lay Station and then jump on bus 194 which will take you right to the entrance. The Park has exotic birds from all over the world. You can walk and/or use the shuttle to get around the park. Be sure to carry plenty of fluids because it gets quite hot. The bird show is spectacular. Here we had the best Haianese Chicken Rice Dish. Highly recommended especially if you have kids
,,Good experience,4.0,,"This is a must do in Singapore as the bird shows are really great. The collection of birds is good with nice collection of penguin, pheasant, wild birds. Expected more of colorful macaws, parrots, small birds."
,,Enjoying the company of our feathered friends,5.0,,"Visited on a Monday in October, and spent most of a day wandering around admiring the birds. I'm no ornithologist but rather enjoyed the simple pleasure of the colours and sounds of the park's inhabitants. The shows are good 'infotainment' - and it was good to see a direct link made to people's consumer choices and impact on bird environments, simple science without being preachy."
,,Best attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"Crazy hot and lots of hills to climb but the birds were just fabulous. For $3sgd you can feed the lorikeets, but be warned… they will perch all over you. In the walk through avairy a parrot also landed on my husband and seemed quite detemined to stay there. Good fun if you like birds.
The waterfall section was hottest of all and we couldn't handle it for very long but was absolutely beautiful."
,,Interesting to See the Conservation Efforts,4.0,,"Pleasant way to fill in a good half day in Singapore. Well laid out with some very good exhibits.

Daily shows at various times but highlight would be the falconry along with the owls.

Good to see the Bird Park is very proactive in conservation efforts for our feathered friends."
,,Loved the Toucans and Hornbills,4.0,,"Sadly the day we chose to visit Jurong Bird Park was one of the worst days for smoke haze so no views at all and very humid. Took the tram ride to the 1st stop then walked to the 2nd stop . Watched the Pelican Show which was very interesting. Then hopped on the Tram again and did the full circle of the park again. Loved the Toucans and the Hornbills, something we don’t get to see in NZ. Don’t bother with the MRT or Bus just get a taxi, it’s much faster, easier and more cost effective for a family of 4."
,,"Kids Love, so do the adults",4.0,,"Amazing place, well maintained, kids will love the shows, specially the morning shows with so many birds flying around the audiences. Kids zone is also another attraction inside the bird park."
,,Nice,4.0,,"next to zoo, this was my favorite tourist attraction. Good collection of birds, can reach them and see fairly close. Well arranged bird shows. Again, transport may be a small issue owing to the remote location."
,,Great place to spend time with your children,5.0,,Went to Jurong with my 3 yrs old daughter and she loved it. She especially enjoyed the interaction with the birds during the bird feeding sessions at the sanctuary. A must visit for a family outing day
,,Kids love it!,4.0,,"We used to have an annual pass to the Bird Park - that's how much our daughter enjoys visiting. Nowadays, with school activities, we don't get there as often as we'd like. Feed the birds at Lory Loft, feed penguins, attend a show, and bring your swimmers for the waterplay area. Shame that they've done away with the monorail."
,,Tweet tweet,4.0,,"If you love birds this is the place for you
There are thousands of them from all over the world
You can feed the lorikeets- great fun as they land on you
The birds of prey show is not to be missed- they fly right over your heads
They are also in huge free flying aviaries so you don't feel like they are trapped. The biggest aviaries in the world, I believe"
,,Family trip,5.0,,A great visit for families. Lots of fun. You can take the train or just walk around. Very educational.
,,Good experience,4.0,,"We could see many different types of birds. Very beautiful birds ...
There was a bird show which was pretty good . Small kids may like it ..
But I did not like the "" Lunch with Parrots "" because we did not get to feed the birds . I loved seeing the penguins dive in the water and catching the fish . There is a man made waterfall which is nice. There is also a cafe to eat nearby . Overall this was a good experience for us ."
,,bird park a little disappointing,3.0,,bird park a little disappointing due to the fact that so many birds are all behind cages that you cant get that close to the birds and photos cant really be taken properly through cages thought they would have had more walk through bird displays that you can get up and personal with the birds
,,very big bird park,5.0,,very big places of interest ! you can try walka round but will take you around 4 hours .please buy more water before go as is expensive inside
,,The Ever Memorable Birds Crippling Sounds,5.0,,One of the most beautiful Bird Sanctuaries around the globe. The birds here are trained to be so friendly that you gonna love them
,,Better than I expected,5.0,,"I had heard mixed reviews about this place and my teen and I loved it! We loved the high flyer show (especially since my teen got to take part) and found the range of birds and exhibits terrific. The tram was helpful when we were feeling hot and tired. Although its a bit of a long trip on public transport, its well worth it."
,,A wonderful place with family,4.0,,this place is family friendly and wonderful for nature lovers and bird lovers......... The bird feeding is one good thing which should not be missed!
,,Very good attraction for families and kids.,4.0,,One should reach there by 10 in the morning as there are bird shows that start from 10:30 am. Don't miss the parrot show which happens at 11:00 am. There is also a tram which takes you around and you can see all kinds of birds never seen before.
,,Lovely and various bird in nature,4.0,,"Good to bring a kid and bird lover here. A lot of bird to explore and if you are tired, there is a tram to survey the park, need not to walk much."
,,Quite a nice place...kids will love it,3.0,,"Quite a nice and clean place...kids will love it. Drink a lot of water and be prepared to walk. Catch some of the shows, they are quite good."
,,One of the best places to Go with your kids and family,5.0,,the Hurons bird park is the ultimate destination for bird lovers and individuals who enjoy nature. Birds are kept in large enclosures which Ives them the freedom to fly about and be close to their natural habitat as possible. The variety of birds on show is also truly noteworthy. Good photo ops are also available with the birds.The bongo burger shop at the entrance serves up some great burgers and the souvenirs shop also has some great bird themed souvenirs to get people back home.
,,Amazing Place!,5.0,,"After the zoo, this is another must visit place for all. There is a huge variety of birds. The bird shows are a must watch. Easily takes a whole day. Lorry feedings is definitely a must. An amazing experience."
,,Nice place if weather is OK,3.0,,The bird park was nice to walk around but the extreme heat and humidity made it a paid after a while. It was better to take the tram but that meant that large sections were missed out. The up and down trails was painful at times. The attractions were good - only wonder that some large birds seem to have small cages?
,,Good experience,4.0,,"The place does not offer air-conditioned rooms to rest, so ensure you take god precaution while travelling with infants"
,,Excellent bird park,4.0,,"Not a must visit unlike the zoo or night safari, it is still one of the best bird park in the world. You can see everything from penguins to owls to raptors. There are two different shows at a few timing so you might want to catch them. The Lory Loft was excellent but now few birds are left at my last visit. The walk in aviaries are really good with a waterfall. Enjoy."
,,Worth a visit if you need to fill in a day but not a highlight of our trip.,3.0,,Not a bad day out but not a priority in my opinion. The trip out to Jurong is reasonably long - on the way out we went via the MRT but it takes way too long (we caught a cab back to town). The bird park is quite nice but not a patch on the zoo so if you have to choose pick the zoo. There is a water park for kids which my 7 year old absolutely loved - she wasn't overly fussed on the birds though. Worth a visit if you need to fill in a day but not a highlight of our trip.
,,Kids should be taken to this park,5.0,,A very good place to spend time with parrots and other naughty birds. Very interesting to see wide variety of birds in one place. Do not put your fingers at parrot mouth it will bite really hard i almost cut my finger by letting a parrot bite. if you have kids please watch them.
,,Amazing experience.,5.0,,Its an absolute must visit place for bird lovers and those with young children. The birds are amazing. The bird shows are a must watch. Time your visit according to the schedule. You can also choose one of the feedings. You must definitely do the lorry feedings. An altogether different experience.
,,Excellent bird show,5.0,,It took me roughly 2-3 hours in the park. The highlight was the eagle & bird show. It was amazing to see the birds and eagle flying around just in front of you.
,,"Not Singapore's Newest Attraction, But Still a Great Place to Visit (Especially for Kids)!",5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park was built way back in 1971, but it has been constantly refurbished over the years, so although it is not one of Singapore's newest attraction, it is certainly not dated either. Firstly, the 'cons' of visiting this place is that it is located in a far corner of Singapore -- Jurong, which is an industrial part of Singapore. Hence, if you are a tourist taking a taxi from the City, it could get a bit pricey (about SGD$30). However, if you are a bit more adventurous, and are willing to take an approximately one hour bus-train ride, I think you would be amply rewarded by the trip. The magical part about the Jurong Bird Park is that there is opportunity to get up close, and even interact, with the birds. That said, a must stop place is the Lory Loft, and while you are there, purchase a bowl of feed for the lories (costing $3). Then, stretch your hand to the lories (or even better, get your kids to do it), and watch them take the food straight from the bowl on your hands (some might be even so bold as to perch on your hands!). Time seems to pass very quickly when you interact with these lories, but be mindful of the showtimes (which is indicated on the map), because the shows are really worth watching. If you kids are young and get restless, one great place to take them within the premises is the ""Birdz of Play"" children's water themepark. At the end of a hot day, cool off at Waterfall (which is located at the innermost part of the Bird Park), or head to the penguin station (called ""Penguin Coast""), where you can watch the penguins swim and play in air-conditioned comfort. There is air-conditioning too at the Breeding & Research Centre of the park, and which is also a great place for your kids to learn how the birds are bred in captivity, to see the young chicks and the different sizes of eggs. So overall, I think the Jurong Bird Park offers a lot, but it's only disadvantage is its non-central location. Hence, to maximise your time, you may want to get to the bird park early (it opens at 8:30am -- but best of all, the birds are most active at that time), and spend up to lunchtime at the Bird Park, before heading to the next tourist attraction."
,,Perfect place for Edutainment,4.0,,It is nice place for visiting with kids. They get lot of knowledge and develop interest in the birds.
,,A must-see,4.0,,"Well, it proves to be to one of the popular tourist attractions in Singapore. We get to see a wide variety of these winged species ,from the most colourful to the most rarest ones. The bird shows conducted in the park were good. Good place to hang out with kids."
,,A Compact & Family Friendly Attraction,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park in the West of Singapore is a great family friendly attraction, especially for those with younger kids who find the size and heat of the Zoo a bit much...Its much more compact and shaded but with loads of different species as well as shows to watch - highly recommended"
,,Bird lovers rejoice!,4.0,,"If you love birds and love taking photos then you will love this place! Easily need around 4 to 5 hours here. It is in an extreme end of Singapore, first catch the MTR then a bus to Jurong.

But the place is huge and if one plans their timing as per the different activities happening there then its good since they have lots of feeding sessions etc. I could experience one feeding session where we were allowed to hold a container of worms and hold our arm high, the birds just swoop down to eat. It was an awesome experience. I wish I had more time there :("
,,simply spectacular,5.0,,"my visit to singapore with my family was awesome .we were there to welcome 2015. we were there for five days. my daughter and my husband including me simply cherished the days spend there. so many places to visit and time always a constraint though. Due to new year, all the places of attraction were fully crowded.we were unable to see night safari inspite of being there.but next we really enjoyed the different species of birds from all over tha world in Jurong Bird Park. it was awesome. the best i enjouyed the penguins and white snowy owls. my daughter loved loved feeding parrots and birds. the group of flamingoes and the show was simply spectacular.. three cheers for jurong bird park"
,,A bird lover must.,4.0,,"fantastic array of exotic birds. The bird shows are terrific, with lots of well trained acts. It is pretty easy to get to by train/bus, with admission price fairly reasonable."
,,Bring Water and Food,5.0,,Recommended for Kids and Kids at heart! Tips: 1) Be guided by the map or you will get lost 2) Wear your most comfortable foot wear 3) Bring Water and Food because you will get hungry while inside
,,Bird Park,5.0,,"This place is like the zoo and nigh safari in Singapore, totally amazing. You will never be disappointed even if you really aren't that interested in Birds. It is a great day out for young and old"
,,Bird lover's paradise,5.0,,Experience with different bird are awesome. Do not mis 3-4 shows which they conduct everyday.Plan for atleast 6 hours inside the park.
,,Brilliant! Great park. World class,5.0,,"The park provides close up experiences with 100s of exotic Bird life including hand feeding. Well laid out and accessible, great for the whole family. A must see in Singapore"
,,Don't miss this....,5.0,,My wife and I visited this way back in 2010 but still have fond memories of the place. Probably the best conservatory in the world for the birds. Amazing shows and well planned layouts still stand out in our minds. Young kids will really enjoy
,,One of the Best Bird-Park in the World,5.0,,"A must visit if in SIN... It's a beautiful concept & birds of all types are featured at this venue... The specially created Aviary is just too good to visit & see the birds in their natural habitat.... With one of the tallest man-made water fall feature is wonderfully placed within the Aviary to give the all natural look to the birds...
Much of the area is open air & with lush green surroundings, it's a truly a magical place to visit..."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"It's a great day out. The High Flying show was amazing, well done to the trainers. Very well kept cages and clean paths and walkways. It really is a world class facility."
,,Great family experience,5.0,,"Thank heavens for the little tram that takes you around this huge site. We couldn't have seen everything available in the heat and humidity and smog.
There are 2 stops where you can get off and then reboard after viewing the enormous number of birds. Some open and natural aviaries, but still too many birds in cages unfortunately. Most are biggish cages, but maybe this will change in the future. At stop 1, the walk-through 'Lory Station' was a treat with so many different varieties of Lorikeets that can be fed and viewed in a natural setting, with a walkway high amongst the trees. At stop 2 we also enjoyed the waterfall walk-through section and were able to have a cool drink and icecream here too as we watched a magnificent peacock wander around us. There are also many lovely plants and flower displays for those who love gardens."
,,Small Birds,1.0,,"So excited when I heard it's a bird park. Came all the way to see the big long dark birds with tropical jungle exoticism. All the birds turned out to be either small Malaysian birds, or dead birds, or dying birds. Not interesting."
,,Fun visit,5.0,,The bird park was a fun trip. Must catch the high flyers show. The show was quite entertaining and is with the trip.
,,it was as exciting as the first visit,5.0,,I have been to Jurong during my previous Singapore visit. This time I ensured that family doesnt miss the experience. Beautiful to see the collection and to also see how thoughtfully the park has been designed so that birds and humans all feel at home.
,,A must see,5.0,,"I absolutely love birds and so obviously I loved the bird park! There was an awesome array of birds and the shows were as amazing as their stars!

If you like interaction then you'll love my personal highlight - the loft. It's a truly awesome experience being surrounded by beautiful birds! If you're lucky they might land on your shoulders (or even your head, just be careful of small parts on your camera because they'd love to eat them!

Give yourself at least 3-4 hours to see the park - we unfortunately arrived later in the day and had to rush most of the attractions."
,,Spread your wings in here !!,4.0,,"Take a stroll around in here or ride the tram (whatever suits you) and enjoy the wide array of AVES as you witness them from close proximity where you are in a cage and the birds soar freely.
You should take note of the bird feedings and the bird shows, absolute bliss to be part of nature for a while.
The bird park is no different in its feature from all that you get to see in SEA, yet it has its distinct texture."
,,A Great Day Out,4.0,,"We had a fantastic time at the Jurong Bird Park - we did not know what to really expect, but we were pleasantly surprised. The highflying bird show was awesome and macaws were so beautiful, the waterfall aviary was a great place to get photos but it was really hot inside - also the food at Bongo Burgers was good and the servings were generous."
,,Worth Visiting but it will take atleast 10 hours to cover all birds patiently.,5.0,,It was so exciting to see all kinds of birds. We were able to interact with the Parrots and small birds in the Birds paradise.
,,Bird Feeding and The bird Show ..WOWWWWWW!!,5.0,,"Bird feeding was sooper ... Birds come and sit on your head , hand , shoulders everywhere... woow simply amazing ...
And the bird show was also spectacular ... Amazing ...
Take the TRAM ride.. Stop at station 1 and then at Station 2 and then you proceed by walking .."
,,A Lovely Surprise,5.0,,"Reading some of the comments I had doubts but had previously booked so we went. What a lovely surprise. We got there early enough for the Flights Bird Show then caught the train to stops near the Loris and the one near the waterfall. Both of these were excellent times and camera, camera, camera. Wear a hat to protect from bird poo otherwise we had a great time."
,,Avian beauty at their best,5.0,,"If you have read my many other reviews on Singapore and the tourist attractions, you will feel that I am biased towards the city. Well, I am ! Yet another amazing place to visit if you are in Singapore. I have never seen birds from such close quarters. Just the visit to the Lory bird enclosure, feed them and feel them pecking at your hands and ears, when they sit on you, is worth all the money. I would love to do it again and again. And then, you have the pelican feeding sessions, the bird shows and so much to keep yourself engaged throughout the day. Its just amazing. Be prepared to walk a lot, if you wish to enjoy the bird park in full, else you also have trams that take you around."
,,Birdies everywhere,4.0,,"It is more like a conservatory than just a park. The establishment have a wonderful collection of different kinds of birds. Mainly from Asia, South Africa and Brazil. If you are a photographer, you will fall in love with this place. Kids friendly as well, you can leave your little ones at the water park right next to the entrance and venture around. The indoor waterfall is a must visit section of the park. Bring your own snacks from 7-eleven before coming."
,,The Birds! AMAZING,5.0,,"Lovely birds, stunning colours, a great walk, a must see. I have some great photos, hopefully one day I will get back there."
,,Jurong Bird Park - we loved the experience,5.0,,An experience that one would cherish for life. You get to see the birds from such a close point & also participate in some of the activities there. The entire family had a great time.
,,Beyond Our Expectations,4.0,,"We had read some mixed reviews and as we had been to the zoo on a previous visit, decided to pay the Bird Park a visit. Glad we did! We spent around four hours and enjoyed the high quality shoiws - Birds of Prey and High Fliers. The exhibits are well presented and some allow visitors to walk through the aviaries. Don't miss the Lory feeding experience where for $3 visitors can hand feed the vaierty of parrots. Great fun!

We used mrt and bus to get there which took around an hour from our hotel to the gates is the Park. MRT to Boon Lay station, where there is a bus interchange. Bus 194 or 251 from there takes 10 minutes and drops you right outside the door."
,,Dont miss the bird shows,4.0,,"Interesting to see the huge variety of bird species. If you dont feel like walking around, they have a mini-train tour which takes you around the place, and you can get down at the drop off station you like. Dont miss the bird shows, where you can get a chance to interact with many well-trained birds. Overall well maintained and worth spending a few hours here."
,,Well Maintained,4.0,,"Great attraction and a must see for families with young children. To me the Lory loft was the best attraction here wherein you can feed all the colorful lorries with food which needs to be purchased separately. It really feels like you are in the midst of an amazonian jungle when you feed these guys and the kids really enjoyed it. Another great attraction were the penguins, fun to just watch. A lot of the birds are kept in cages which make it difficult to spot them or get a view and maybe that is something done to keep them away from any sort of predator activity but sort of takes the natural experience away the kind you get in the zoo. The cafes are ok but not many and the cafes outside the bird park are super expensive. SGD 15 for a burger...try to have food inside if you must.

The picture sessions with the birds are interesting but to be paid for and they do not allow enthusiastic tourists to take pictures of families like that. The location is fairly away from everything in Singapore and a Taxi ride one side will cost you about SGD 22-23."
,,Must do,5.0,,A lovely way to spend a morning. Catching the MRT and connecting bus was easy. Loved the penguin enclosure the best
,,Amazing bird park,5.0,,"A great experience seeing birds and good bird shows available throughout the day. Time required to see the entire park is at least half day. Great place to visit for nature lovers, both young and old."
,,Good family visit,5.0,,This is a nice and well maintained place. Must visit if you are with travelling with family with kids.
,,Lovely Bird Park that excites,4.0,,"This is a nice Bird Park where you can view different types of Birds and other. Most important is to Watch the Show as one of the highlight. There are 2 Different shows per day, so enjoy Both"
,,A must-see for both young and old,5.0,,"Asia’s largest bird paradise and don't miss the High Flyers Show at 3.00 pm.Also there was feeding sessions, tram rides. We really enjoyed especially my kid."
,,Not to miss attraction,4.0,,"Great experience!! Situated lil far away from the other attractions, this place is must visit for bird lovers. Should take around 4 Hours to visit the park. Please check the show timings and dont miss the High Flyers show!!"
,,Absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!!,5.0,,"I read different reviews before coming here...some people said its only for kids, only needed 2 hours, cages were tiny and not very many birds etc.

Well...I can say I've never been to a place quite like this!! Soo many different species of birds from owls, Eagles, flamingoes, parrots, penguins, toucans, macaws and the list goes on and on!!!! But they also had many types of each species all from around the world!
We got there at 12pm and stayed till 6pm (only because the park was closing)
They had many open enclosures where the birds can fly straight past you and if your lucky as we were they will land on your shoulder!! We also got to feed different species of lorikeets and parrots!
The enclosures are big and the staff are very informative and happy to chat with you.
They have 2 bird shows, both very educational and really enjoyable. The birds fly around you and they get the audience involved! You also have a chance after the show to take pictures of the birds!

If you don't like birds then don't go there because all you are going to see is birds! But if your like us and you do like them then I'd be very surprised if you left this place un amazed by what you have seen!

Best time to go is during the week. That's when we went and it wasn't busy at all.
The only negative remark is that the food is quite pricey. But worth it for what you get to see and experience at the park!!!!!!"
,,Good experience,4.0,,"We visited here with our family including a young grandson.
The shows are very professional and the birds are highly trained.
The grounds are well kept and the facilities clean.
The downside was the cost of food in the burger restaurant. Definitely on the high side.
The only issue I have is with the small cages that the birds are kept in.
However if you want to see exotic birds it is a good place."
,,Simply loved it,4.0,,"It's a great experience overall. Simply loved it. children enjoy shows and water theme park, especially the child friendly restaurant. little choice of food though."
,,Jurong bird park,5.0,,This is a must for everyone who is visiting singapore . It has a great layout for all the bird lovers .you will find all different varieties of bird from all over the world . They have tram to go around . They have an in closed park where u can find birds all around u . There is a bat enclosure . It is all dark so that you can see what the bats do at night . It's really interesting and beautiful
,,great experience...,5.0,,Lots of varieties of birds. My personal favourites are lorries and cuckattoos. The shows are superb. And a nice waterplay area for kids also.
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"Kids will surely gonna enjoy this park as they can see different Kinds of birds,very educational. The show there was fantastic.. Birds are very well trained. I will visit this place but with my kids this time.."
,,Part of your Must See's in Singapore,4.0,,Again another Must see on a Singapore Tour.Dont Miss the Bird Shows and also the Bird feedings.Kids would love this.
,,Absolutely wonderful,5.0,,"A bird lovers treat - from the amazing vegetation to the lorikeet house to rare birds, the raptor show, the most colorful flamingos on parade along and a beautiful very rare hyacinth macaw. Well worth a visit for anyone."
,,birds and colours,5.0,,"its a world famous zoo comprising of birds,specimens of magnificient bird life from around the world.Main attraction is a large flock of flamingoesIt is managed by the Wildlife Reserves,Singapore.go to the park early morning when it opens and get entertained by the bird shows,beautiful pathways to walk around,the colourful varieties of birds which one can see is very thrilling.I never wanted to come out of this Nature's park."
,,Recommend a visit,5.0,,"I really enjoyed this visit. It was very warm but there are places around the park where you can sit under a fan and cool a little bit. We didn't use the little train to get around as the park isn't so big and there are only three stops, but it may suit some people who are not as able. A lot of the attractions allow you to walk about with free roaming birds. The Lory Loft was fabulous. This is a giant cage which allows you to get up very close and personal with the birds. For $3 you can buy food for the Lorys. Be warned, you will be swamped with Lorys which will land on you!!!! They are very gentle birds and quite entertaining.
The food and drink by the Lory Loft was very reasonably priced but I didn't see how much anything was anywhere else in the park.
I would recommend insect repellent as you walk around this attraction (unfortunately, I didn't use any!!!)
The attraction is a way outside Singapore but we travelled by MRT (green line to Boon Lay) and then bus (number 194 from the terminus short distance from the MRT station through shopping mall. Cost of bus ticket was $1.60 one way) The whole journey took approximately an hour."
,,Superb place if you are a bird lover,4.0,,I am not into birds but my mom loved and enjoyed this place too much. Check the bird shows and click lot of photos with all exotic birds. In short: nice.
,,great family attraction,4.0,,"Spent an enjoyable couple of hours here with teenagers, who also enjoyed this place. Make sure you get to the shows early, they were really good and the variety of birds to see is very expansive."
,,Smaller than you might think but with some great exhibits,4.0,,"Contrary to some of the reviews here, I do think the bird park is worth at least one visit. The cost of entry is reasonable and there is plenty to see although unless you stay for one of the 'big' shows, you can do the whole park in half a day. There is a mini tram/shuttle inside the park which is cheaper if you bundle it with the initial entry ticket. Because this is singapore and because of the amount of water in and around the park, it is very humid so a tip from me would be to use the tram to get to the back of the park then walk your way back to the front, criss-crossing the park to take in the exhibits you think might be of most interest to you. The waterfall aviary, at the back of the park, is well worth spending time in as it's the largest walk-in aviary in the world. There are hundreds of varieties of birds free-roaming in this area and it's the place you'll see the most relaxed, least zoo-stressed birds. It's not unusual to turn a corner and meet something walking the other way and the birds are cautious of humans but not outright scared so you can get some good photos if you're careful.
There are a couple of other walk-in aviaries which are each good in their own way. I'm a bit ambivalent about zoos or zoo-type facilities because the enclosures are often not adequate for the animals they contain. For the most part, the Jurong Bird Park has reasonable enclosures, the only two notable exceptions being the emu/ostrich area and the condor cage. Given that a condor has a 3m wing span - the largest of any bird species still alive - the cage they were in here was too small for them to be able to get up any flight speed, distance or elevation and they all looked badly stressed.
That was the black spot on an otherwise enjoyable visit for us. The breeding and research center is worth tracking down - it's well hidden on the right side of the park - and if you're lucky you'll see the volunteers feeding hatchlings or otherwise caring for them.
The other exhibit worthy of extra attention is the owl exhibit. Let your eyes adjust - it's a dark, cool, indoor exhibit - and you'll see a varied collection of owls.
The park has a large play area for kids, but as we have none, I can't comment on the suitability of those facilities although they looked clean and well-maintained.
There are organised shows throughout the day from falconry exhibits to bird-feedings and educational sessions with certain species. We took in the falconry show and it was well put together and a definite crowd-pleaser.
Getting there and back was easy - at the time of writing the 194 bus operated a loop service from the park to the Boon Lay subway (MRT) interchange. You get on and off at the same bus stop and it's about 3 minutes outside the park."
,,wasting time,2.0,,"There were few birds than expected, some cages are smelly, and i think there is no need of tram ride to cover the area, so be careful when taking tickets, they are promoting tram ride on admission, i think its a wasting of money, because the area is small and there are few types of birds."
,,A must visit park for all visitors,4.0,,"A wonderful place for the lil ones and the whole family. I'll recommend you to get the tickets with the tram, as soon as you are inside the park, go for the tram ride for a round then decide when to spend more time.
There's no place to hide if you go there on a hot day, so you don't really want to walk around aimlessly.

Have lunch at the songbird terrace. They have a show at 1pm for 30 mins. You can book online (pay only after your meal) to ensure you get a good table. The buffet there is very simple, but tasty. The bird show worth all the money."
,,Colourful Fun Day Out,5.0,,"One of my favourites to take international visitors to Singapore. It's a fair amount of walking and can be a whole day activity, but well worth it to see the wonderful exhibits throughout the park. The Waterfall Aviary - right at the back of the park, is so beautiful and peaceful, and the Lory loft, where you can feed the birds, are both high up in popularity, as are the amazing colours of the flamingos and parrots. The penguins are also a lot of fun to watch. The only thing to be aware of is that it can be a wait at the end of the day at the taxi rank - I would recommend planning ahead and ordering a taxi for a fixed time or taking public transport."
,,Unforgettable!,5.0,,"went here on the recommendation of my mum, and to be hones to really didn't have high hopes as birds aren't really my thing but geez was I wrong! The bird park was fantastic with so much to see and do. The highlights had to be the breeding centre and the birdshow itself. The breeding centre doesn't look that exciting from the outside but it is well worth it. Inside they had baby parrots and baby flamingos that I literally had to be dragged away from they were so adorable. Food was disgusting and overpriced but we quickly got over that. If I tell you the birdshow was incredible you will still be pleasantly surprised when you see it. Just go!!"
,,Not worth a second visit,3.0,,"Very average place, the 2 shows were nothing to shout about and did not wow me. However something to take note of is the weather is extremely hot and there are mosquitoes all over the place. I was bitten very badly by a whole bunch of mosquitoes. The place stank very badly too and all u see there are enclosed cages with metal bars. The poor birds look very trapped and restricted in their tiny spaces too fr what I saw. Definitely not worth the admission price of $28, definitely will not return again. What makes it worse is tt the bird park is so inaccesible and so out of town and all the way in the west of SG and u have to take a bus fr boon lay mrt stn. Travelling time is easily 11/2 to 2 hrs long. So not worth the time and money to go there."
,,Fantastic bird park,4.0,,This is a must see if you like birds. The wire netting is far above the trees. Birds fky freely and are fed at strategic spots along the wooded paths. Labels help for identification. Periodic shows for kids.
,,Birds?,4.0,,"A terrific place to see the fauna of the city, enjoyed the variety of birds eco friendly and well maintained"
,,Good place for kids,3.0,,"Kids will love this place because there are many kinds of birds and bird shows here. Otherwise, I don't think it will be a lovely trip for couples."
,,Bird Park visit....,3.0,,"We spent a couple of hours at the Bird Park this week, was disappointed at some areas of the park and the amount of birds that can actually be seen, when going into the lorry loft there was very few birds that were feeding with alot of space but not so many feeding trays filled and birds around. A lot of beautiful greenery and it was well kept and clean although a bit dated now."
,,Must visit - If u have kids,2.0,,"I am not a big fan of bird parks or zoos, but if you like a bird park that is clean and doesn't torture the birds in captivity do visit this place. Far from the city this place is nice and a refreshing visit esp if u have kids under 10. Food is horribly expensive inside though!"
,,Bird park walk,5.0,,Singapore Birdpark is one of the best place to visit in Singapore. It's located and west part of Singapore and can be easily accessed by bus and Taxi. Various bird shows are worth to see again and again. Parrot loft is a good place to have a close touch with beautiful birds.
,,Superb :),5.0,,"Very Nice Bird park and one of the best attractions in Singapore.
My top 3 would be Lorry loft,High flyers show and the waterfall.
Worth a visit and you could have leisure time there.
Feeding the parrots with honey was an amazing experience.
Kids would love this place"
,,Not a bad morning or afternoon out,4.0,,"We loved the bird park, it was a little tired in spots but a work in progress, has some of the most amazing birds .Staff friendly and the grounds are beautiful"
,,A learning fun activity.,5.0,,"Very educative and fun outing for kids. Lots to learn for adults also. Avoid paid shows like dine with parrots, not worth it. buffet options at terrace restaurant very bad. look out for show timings."
,,Dont miss the birds of pray show,4.0,,Interesting array of beautiful birds the birds of pray show is excellent and kids will love this place
,,Beautiful Birds in Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is the biggest bird park in Asia. We are bird lover, so we really love this place. The park is having a lot of species of birds."
,,Kids' Favorite,5.0,,JBP is an amazing place for kids over the weekend. The High Flyers show at 3 pm is a fantastic show for all ages.
,,Still the same as 20 years ago,4.0,,"The attractions have not changed for the past 20 years, even the shows are still the same!
Nonetheless, this is a good place to have a slow walk and enjoy the sights and sounds of the birds from various parts of the world!
Do note that the food options at
Jurong Bird Park is extremely expensive! Expect to spend at least $18 per person for simple finger food and drinks!"
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,We spent the day here for my partners birthday and we absolutely loved it being so close to all the birds. We in particular loved the lorry loft with the Lorikeets you are able to feed them and have them sit on your arms etc it is amazing
,,Good but used to be better,3.0,,"We first visited in 1985 when they had dozens of multi coloured parrots, trained not to fly away, in the trees at the entry kiosks. They are not there any more. There are many anxious caged birds looking for a way out. The flamingos are not caged and free to roam in vast spaces. The waterfall is spectacular and the trained bird displays great for kids. Worth a visit for young children, possibly not for adults only."
,,A splash of Color,5.0,,"The park showcases colorful bird-life from around the world. Visit the penguins from the southern extremes of the planet to colorful tropical birds from the rainforests.

Penguin Coast and Flamingo Pool near the entrance are not to be missed as are the lory loft, macaw island, birds of paradise and waterfall aviary all of which amaze you with our brightly colored avian friends. You can walk among the birds at the lory loft and waterfall aviary and also feed them (yes they will eat out of your hands). For a final splash of bright red, the scarlet ibis towards the exit are difficult to beat.

Don't miss the Kings of the Skies and High Flyers shows or the Pelican Chit Chat, Ostrich feeding and Bird Feeding sessions. You can also visit the breeding center to see the birds hatching and growing.

Not to be missed if you are in Singapore. The park is not too big and half a day should be sufficient. If you have the time and plan to visit multiple parks, buy the park hopper ticket to avail attractive discounts."
,,Beautiful Collection of Birds..A Must go for Kids!!!,5.0,,"Jurong Bird is one of its kind park with a exotic collection of birds. The shows were too good and must see...Though very naive to the various species of Birds, we still enjoyed the park. A Must go and Highly Recommended!!!"
,,Must visit.. if you have kids.,5.0,,Great place for Family and kids...its a long walk if you are interested.Best take the car ride and then watch the bird show.. be there early in the morning for the first show... best time.
,,good spot,4.0,,"good spot, make sure you check the show times and don't miss the show. we should have checked the weather before we visited as it rained."
,,very big park,4.0,,"must watch is the bird show and photo session with flamingos, horn bill shows, slow walk through the park,lots of birds in their seem to be natural habitat"
,,Jurong Bird Park,3.0,,"How to get there: The nearest MRT station to Jurong Bird Park is on the East-West (Green) line. Then catch buses going to Jurong Bird Park.

If you're into different kinds of bird, this is the place for you. I loved the beautiful pink flamingos located at Flamingo Pool and Lake, and enjoyed taking lots of photos at the Lory Loft. You can also buy bird food and feed the Lorys. The place also has FREE wifi, but not all though. Other than these places, my friend and I just rode the park bus that goes around.. you can hop on and hop off the bus anytime you like. We bought our tickets in one of the travel agency that sells them at a discounted price.

Overall, it was an educational experience. especially for children.

Since it is an open air park, I suggest that you prepare yourself for the unpredictable weather and bring the following, just in case.
Hat or umbrella, shades or sunglasses, sunblock, water bottle to drink, fan and extra shirt

,,Went there with my dad and sis.,4.0,,"Love looking at the birds, there some changes and so far it was a great visit. But it can be a long and tiring work for older folks."
,,You get to feed penguins!,5.0,,"I love how they have a wide variety of species which I have never seen/heard of before. The trails was easy to follow with the help of a map. My buddy who was sceptical about going to a bird park actually enjoyed it! Highlight of my entire visit was being able to feed the penguins. Mind you, better grab it once the trainer is done talking about the penguins! Also, you are only allowed to feed the penguins from OUTSIDE the enclosure."
,,Beautiful birds in amazing natural habitat,4.0,,"A great place to go with family and kids and spend time at this Bird park. They have hundreds of species, kept in natural surroundings and a lovely way to wind down and go thru the park with family and friends."
,,Best to visit with kids,3.0,,"A nice place with various birds species and bird show. My fave, the world of darkness whereas all of the bird species mostly alive at night"
,,Good place for kids,4.0,,"I've had unforgettable memories and experiences with the birds here. Taking photos with them is also really nice. I love that. But I won't be back. It's kinda boring to me but it's a good park for kids indeed. Pulling yourself out of the computer & all that technology, enjoy and learn more from nature is good."
,,"Very good, neat and worth the penny place",5.0,,"Variety is the one word used to describe the birds. Good restaurant near the gate, we feel a brunch is necessary to view the entire park. Also, pre book your taxi while leaving as it takes hours for taxi queue for your chance. Kids water theme park was good. Please take kids swimming costume. We paid 20$ for the same......major birds can be seen through tramps. Must visit."
,,Great bird park! Would come back if i had the chance,5.0,,"best experience for my husband. overall a great place, nice shows, great staff, great selection of birds but really the highlight that we can never forget in this place is the lory loft. we actually got in almost closing time.. and the person selling the feeds was closing. but we begged her so we can try feeding the lorys. Oh it was a blessing for us. the experience was so wonderful when birds would flock to you and stand on your arms and shoulders.
we didnt have much time as we only arrived around lunch time. a tip for everyone.. there is so much to see in jurong bird park.. so if you are a bird brain like my husband, better go early so you can see everything."
,,Lots of birds,5.0,,Squawk so many birds they are so noisy but lovable love this park it is really interesting and there are so many species of birds to see
,,1 full day - for Families with kids,5.0,,"It's easy to reach, through MRT till Key Loon station and then bus no 94 (it is all written on the website). The MRT station has a huge mall, you can have food and maybe do some shopping there. Board the bus from the ground floor of the Mall.

Buy tickets from authorised travel agent, include 5$ for tram, agents usually give 20% off on listed price.

If u have kids, reach by 9:30 - 10:00 and enjoy the full day, there are various shows, note the timings, grab the map at the entry gate. The volunteers are young chaps and very friendly, ask them for anything. Pay 2$ for feeding a basket of fish to birds, kids would like it, this money goes to charity. Bird feeding / bird shows are work enjoying twice, before noon and again at 3:00 pm.

Food : although the website says outside food not allowed, but say a lot of families carrying packed meals.

If u have small kids then spend the whole relaxed day, while returning stop at Chinese Gardens (next MRT stop)."
,,naure at its best- very good for children,5.0,,take ur kids here to see the beauty of nature. You need to walk a lot so be prepared with flat shoes and an umbrellla. The shows inside were amazing. You can check out the timings and plan your walk accordingly. The bird feeding is a great experience for young kids . I will recommend this Park for all ages. you can skip the Night Safari but not this.
,,Lots of birds,4.0,,This is a very good park. Feed Lorikeets and see a lot of cool birds. I would highly recommend riding the tram from the gate to the first stop as you go up a rather big hill. You can then walk the rest on your way down.
,,jurong bird park,5.0,,"A must do. Period.
Kids will go ga ga.... The place is amazingly well laid out and managed. A lot of activities for everyone. Get a combo pass online for the zoo, bird park, safari etc and cover all of it over 3 days. Take a bit of your kids favourite eats as the ones on offer may not be their fancy. Plenty of good fast food joints and restaurants in campus so no problem at all."
,,Beautiful !,4.0,,"Beautiful Bird park with many varieties of birds. The show is also very nice. Tram ride in the park is dissapointment as it moves very fast and most of the cages are not visible due to plantation. Waterfall is beautiful. Personally I do not like captivity of birds and animals,and particularly during the show they are trained on grid of food is unfortunate. Overall beautiful park worth visiting when in Singapore."
,,Family fun trip,5.0,,"Never experienced a bird show of such a performance that the team had put up, what a show I should say and my family really enjoyed and had a great time there"
,,The unmissable,5.0,,"A good place to unwind for the young and the old alike. With a small train to take you around, hop off at the gorgeous waterfall or the pond of flamingoes or just walk along the trail soaking in the atmosphere. Don't miss the bird show."
,,Worth the money,4.0,,"This bird park is really huge! Go early in the morning so that you won't miss all the shows / feeding time.
It is well maintained and clean.
Food is normal attraction price. So it can be expensive.
They have this slushies in tall bottles. Nice to buy them and walk around the park on hot days."
,,Best bird park,5.0,,"The best part of the park is that its very well maintained and marked. Do a great favour to yourself, start early to enjoy the day span. Its a big park and the tram ride would be like a trailer. Walking the park would be the movie! The feeding sessions are up, close and personal so I am never gonna miss it."
,,"Birds, Birds, Birds !",4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is the largest Bird Park in the world and is built around a hill. The place is huge and the day we went it was very hot and humid, so we fully utilized the services of the tram which dropped us at the various places to see the birds and catch the shows (We liked the pelican show the most). Besides the bird shows another attraction is the large man-made waterfall. The park is very clean and well maintained. To beat the heat we bought ice-slushies in tall bottles in animal shapes which made for lovely souvenirs. Early mornings are the best time to visit the park."
,,Worth Visiting,4.0,,"Something unique at this place! There are walk in aviaries with close up experience. The shows are nice too. However, the food and beverages are rather expensive at this place. Otherwise, it could be a great place."
,,Bird lover,3.0,,"Truly inspirational it was easily accessible well designed.

Staff were friendly, knowlegible and informative.

Facilities were very good.

Signage provided clarity and maps were easy to follow.

Birds well maintained.

Gift store was over the top expensive even tho i had the cash to spend it was a principal thing.

The show was a treat i would have loved to have seen the birds of prey s how but i understand that there must be a sepatation of types l.

I will return

Paul"
,,Real Good Place To Visit With Family,5.0,,"Travelled Jurong Bird Park with My Family , I would say i was 200% satisfied , It was both a recreational and Educational Visit For My Kids and Family , Do Visit This Place if you are in Singapore"
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"We had an absolutely splendid time here. An amazing variety of birds from all around the world are here and you can read about them so it's very interesting for the kids to see which part of the globe the bird comes from And what it eats and how close it is to extinction etc.
I would suggest waking rather than biggie ride for anyone fit enough to walk but for those with very young kids or older people there is a buggy like transport going around.
The boys loved the feeding area gir birds as its amazing to see all these beautiful birds come close to you and eat from the palm of your hands And in some cases 2-3 or more birds will sit on you. Kids loved it and did not want to leave at all. The bird shows were phenomenal. Mind boggling how the birds have been trained so beautifully. My son thought the birds were not real infact and said its a trick - they are using robots. That's how good the birds were in the shows.
I highly recommend for families to visit. Lots of fun and very educational for kids.

Please do not buy food at the restaurant near bird feeding area. Worst food ever I had in Singapore. The hotdogs shown are not what u get. Hotdogs are 10 inch and put into small bread buns. Cheating. The pasta with chicken was horrible. Not worth eating.
There is no decent meal available. No fruit or salads. Buy only soft drinks or dry stuff from here.

Also so not be tricked into buying the combo of river cruise together with this park ticket. What we thought was a river cruise was a very very dissapointibg 15 min boat ride next day in the lake and we saw distant glimpse of a giraffe and back side of an elephant.

Than we had to buy additional tickets to go see the pandas. That is a rip off. Not fair guys.

I would highly recommend the jurong bird park to anyone."
,,Doesn't matter whether you love birds - this is still a great place to visit,5.0,,"A really wonderful place to visit for all. Great exhibits with walk in aviaries to make the experience up close and personal. Having the birds flying and walking around you in the huge aviaries makes the entire visit special and different from just seeing them in the cages. Lots of the birds are free flying and its simply beautiful to see them perched on the trees.

Do not miss the show called the ""High Flyers Show"". It has got to be one of the most entertaining animal shows we have seen and kudos to Jurong Bird Park for this. It is funny and engaging, with hardly a dull moment.

For the elderly and those with young children, do note that there are large portions of this park which is on an undulating terrain so some parts require walking on steep slopes. There is a tram service which would greatly help those who are unable to manage the walk.

The wet play area, which is called Birdz of Play is fantastic especially for toddlers and young kids. It is not a very big area (smaller than the one at the Singapore Zoo), but it is also much less crowded, which makes it more enjoyable. Shower areas are very large which makes it easy to shower the kids after they have had their fun. If you are coming to the Bird Park especially for this wet play area, do note that they have days where they close for maintenance. Its on their website so it may be best to check it before you go all the way to the park.

One point to note which I hope that Jurong Bird Park will improve on is that the food quality is not very good. The food choices are rather limited and we have tried both the burgers as well as the local food at the front and it is really not up to par. Very expensive and really poor in quality.

Otherwise, everyone is bound to have a good time here. You will likely need at least half a day or more. It does get very humid in the bird park, so do come prepared in the right clothing and good walking shoes."
,,nice bird park,4.0,,worth a visit if u like birds. so many kind of birds and admission cost is acceptable. good and clean zoo and underwaterworld is very good.well organised.
,,Best Bird Park we been to so far!!,5.0,,"Amazing bird park! A must see attraction in Singapore.
If you have kids, then dont miss it.
So Many shows, don't miss them at all. Every show is great and we left wondering how great they were ....
So many bird species and colours...
Give a full day for bird watching :-)
Carry water
Caps and sunscreen essential.
I'd take my snacks with me to keep me happy :-)
Happy Holidays!!"
,,intresting nature of the birds,5.0,,amazing birds park a wide variety of species to be found ..the live shows at the pools amphi theatre are really worth watch...
,,Awesome bird park,5.0,,This would have to be the best bird park in the WORLD nothing else come close you need to take your time as it is very hot and humid there at any time of the year drink plenty of water and just enjoy the close up experience
,,Bird Watching,4.0,,"If you love birds you must visit the largest bird park of the world which is the Jurong Bird Park of Singapore. You can feed and hold the parrots and for sure you must enjoy watching the amazing bird show. Very easy to go there, there is a bus from jurong east train station."
,,must see,5.0,,Oh the variety of birds you will se here is amazing. They will just won your heart. I went with my family and really enjoyed ourselves.
,,Excellent High Flyers show,4.0,,"The park is looking dated and walking long distances in the humidity was hard, but it is still a beautiful place. The High Flyers show was very good and worth a visit for this alone. Very good owl and penguin exhibits. I found a couple of hours here was long enough. There is an airbase nearby and we had fighter jets roaring over the whole time."
,,One of the Best of Singapore's Tourist Destination.,5.0,,"The best animal/wildlife park in Singpore. The birds are really amazing. Do not miss the 2 bird shows (refer to the leaflets for the schedule). There are ice cream parlors near the crow show place. The foods inside are in buffet but costly. You may take your lunch just outside the gate (don't miss the stamp in your arms if you want to return inside). The bird's show are really funtastic, again don't miss it. Visit the artificial waterfalls and see face to face some unique and never before seen birds. There is also a snack bar at its entrance.

Walk, walk to see all the things that this place can offer. Don't use tram i sugggest.

There are place where you can feed the birds, its fun.

Go there and discover about many different, colorful, exotic, lovely, noisy, active, tall, short, frightening, angry, insensitive, beautiful, regal, powerful, huge, small and (write description here)....

Go there! enjoy."
,,"Nostalgic, pleasant visit",4.0,,"I first visited Jurong Bird Park during a school excursion when I was in primary school. As memory fades with age, I could not remember much about the trip except that it was a nice place. 25 years later, in August 2015, I visited Jurong Bird Park again, this time round with my family. As I stepped into the theme park, I noted that it has changed but the nostalgic nice feeling remains. I had a queer thought then: Are the birds I saw in the past still alive?
There was a large variety of birds in the enclosures properly labelled with names, country of origin and habitats. The man-made waterfall was still there and even though it was an artificial one, it looked good. The highlights of the park had to be the entertaining bird shows and amazingly obedient birds. If you like birds, this place is definitely worth a half day visit."
,,Interesting Place,5.0,,This is my first time to visit the place. Found it very interesting with a lot of bird. Its good for families and casual outing for a weekend gateway.
,,Bird lovers will enjoy. Great family outing....,4.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park was a very pleasant experience. Good shows and the handlers were skilled and attendants all very attentive and supportive. Lots of walking so wear flats and preferably tennis shoes. Tram system in place that is nice from exhibit to exhibit for a few dollars more.

Initially I had a bit of a negative reaction to the cages, but some of the designs were smart enough to have you go in and get a closer view of the birds in very nicely designed environments which mimicked their own. Except for the great birds of prey. Hated seeing them just sitting there in less than ideal conditions. But I understood.

Stinky ostriches, cute penguins, noisy flamingoes and a variety of other beauties that were a pleasure to see up close. Some species you can feed from your hand and come up eagerly to partake and interact. Excellent leisure activity for adults, seniors and for children, and the children I saw feeding the birds were enjoying it immensely.

I had a hard time getting good photos on this excursion, but here are a few to enjoy."
,,Photo-ops galore!,3.0,,"Birds, birds and more birds! Great fun, especially for children, but, really, who doesn't like colorful birds? It's really quite an awesome experience to be able to get this close, so be sure to bring a camera or two and savor the elegant creatures."
,,High Flying,4.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park boasts of almost 5000 Birds, flamingos, pelicans, Tocans, Vultures, Ospreys and Owls to name a few. It also boasts of the highest out door man made water fall. Brillant shows are High Flyers & Birds of Prey."
,,Clean bird park,5.0,,The bird park is very clean and they have great activities for children. I could feed the birds and if i remembered correctly then i could remember from the waterplayground. That was also alot of fun! I would recomend this place!!!
,,"Entertaining for Kids, Relaxing for Adults",4.0,,"Both bird shows were very entertaining, but the better one was the smaller less attended one at the back of the park. Vultures were impressive to see as well as a lot of small and big exotic birds. Staff is well skilled at controlling the birds, and put on a great show. The shows are mostly popular and good for children, but it is a nice and relaxing activity for adult tourists as well. A fun few hours of photos and interacting with some of the birds lay in this park. There are so many different birds present that you'll want to keep taking pictures of all of them, some more entertaining and beautiful than others. The park even has their own shuttle service around the park, for a fee, in case you don't feel like walking around. However, if you feel like seeing everything and not just the highlights, I recommend that you walk around. Check out the noisy birds and flamingos!"
,,A different way to see captive birds,4.0,,"I was suspicious about a special zoo with birds only. Birds tend to look 'wrong' in a cage. However, at Jurong Bird Park there are several huge aviaries, where birds can fly around free and you walk right through their habitat. I really enjoyed those tremendously. I must say that I rather see common birds in such an aviary than a rare bird in a cage. So yes, it was absolutely worth it to go and see the bird park. The only negative point I have is that there were often 'additional' birds in the enclosures whose names were nowhere on the sign boards."
,,The bird show was decent but could have been more impressive,4.0,,"In any case, it struck me as a worthwhile afternoon if you live in or near Singapore but nothing to really write home about if you're visiting."
,,Wonderful Collection of Colourful Birds,5.0,,"Whilst many cities have an interesting and varied collection of animals at their zoos, there are very few cities that have an enclosed park full of birds. Try and arrange your visit to coincide with the morning or afternoon shows, which are intersting for adults and children. Great opportunity to get your pic with a flock of colourful flamingo's after the show"
,,Great Experience to be on the Land of Thousand Colors,5.0,,"Surrounded by thousand of colors and flying creatures, feels like I will fly with them. The place charmed the visitors with its collection. It is no wonder that Jurong Bird Park has been awarded as one of the renowned bird sanctuaries, with some of the largest free flying aviaries in the world. There also some undeniably performances and shows such as lunch with parrot, flamingo feeding, and feeding frenzy tour that ought not to be missed. It is not difficult to get the place, you can take MRT on the East-West (Green Line), transit on Boon Lay Station and catch the connecting public buses Bus No. 194 or 251
From Boon Lay bus interchange. This is great experience to be there!!"
,,Fine Feathered Friends,5.0,,"The range of exhibits, the fine condition of the birds and the excellent planning and physical location of the attractions makes it easy to understand why this is a highly rated Singapore attraction. The vibrant colours of the Chilean and Caribbean flamingoes, the first exhibit we saw, was quite breathtaking. The meandering path through the park ensures that surprises are just around each corner. The informative shows highlight the features of many of the parks major attractions and are well worth attending. Throughout the park the tropical foliage and water features, including a 13 stories high waterfall, provide additional joy for both the avid photographer, and the amateur snapper.

A taxi from the city to the Bird Park is only about $15."
,,A great place for children,4.0,,"We had a great time here dividing our time between wandering around the enclosures and joining in the staff led activities/ shows. Plenty for the family to enjoy. The downside of Jurong is the catering. What a missed opportunity. Some places seemed slightly better but the Lori Loft Cafe was appalling in the choice and the quality of the food. It is described on the website as offering: a selection of delectable sandwiches. I can assure you there was nothing remotely like the pictures displayed. Come on, get with the trend and provide some wholesome, fresh, healthy food. This cafe along with Safari Scoops was littered with uncollected trays/ plates/ cups. Jurong please improve your food facilities.
The children's play area was very good with attentive lifeguards in the water play area. The staff at the Pelican feeding area also deserve a mention."
,,Birdy Delight!,4.0,,"A very unique experience for me as I have never been to a stand alone bird park. They have awesome shows where well trained birds delight you with their activities. Lorry Loft is another major area where you can feed the birds while clicking pictures. The place is rich in colours with bright multicoloured birds all over the place.
Pink flamingos, red parrots, rainbow colored birds will keep you engaged and happy..Another best thing is the penguin arena, it has huge amount of penguins..

Loved it totally."
,,Best I have seen,3.0,,"The variety of birds that are covered is huge. Even though we spent only half a day there, but if to be experienced in detail, I recommend a full day tour. Because it is knowledgeable. My rating being less us because of the parrot enclosures which I found rather small and the bird conditions looked cramped."
,,Colourful Chirpy Experience !!,4.0,,Worth a visit especially with the kids...so many species of birds and the sight of pink flamingos is amazing !! Dont forget to visit the penguins and the shows and the tropical rainforests with the waterfall....super fun !!
,,Zero management,2.0,,"The experience as a whole is not too bad. I will begin with the good parts:
If you go there in the morning, it is more quiet, (remember to put on some insect repellent spray if you are prone to attract mosquitoes). If you like a bit of walking it is a nice time to be there. We took the tram though. The bird feed near the waterfall was a lot of fun and you can take some close up pictures with them. There is a park for the children to get wet and play. We went for Lunch with Parrot. The lunch part was horrible(see below), the parrot show was very good, educational and entertaining, suitable for children between 4-11.

The bad part: I don't know why people will feed chips to the birds. Chips! The snack they sold you from the cafe are meant for you to eat only. If you can run a bird park by feeding chips to bird you can run one in your backyard. Please people.

The Lunch with parrot at Songbird terrace: When we arrived the place was closed to everyone. There were already 60-80 people inside, some more were waiting. Around 10 or more empty tables were available so I walked pass the barrier strings to told a male waiter I have a booking.
The reply I got was they have no place for me, the main reason being there was a tour group of 200 people strong booked lunch there. If I must have lunch there they will have a place for me, but it will be at least 12:45 or later. The parrot show starts at 1:00 p.m. and we are due to leave at 2:00 p.m.
I asked if we will be compensated if we eat elsewhere since we already made full payment for lunch at 12:00. The overbooking was not our fault and I do not understand why our booking was on a lower priority.
The answer was no, my money was only good there. I told the male waiter that having 15 minutes for lunch then run to a show is not acceptable. He can either give us a table at noon or not. I showed him my confirmation e-mail from the sales team. He simply ignored the letter and began to question the authenticity of my booking. He wanted me to give him credit card receipt or proof that I paid. The only thing you got by booking online is one e-mail with details of booking and a confirmation number, to which he chose to ignored. If this is truly how booking system works, what is the point of sending me a confirmation e-mail with a 7digit confirmation number?
I insisted I have paid and he reluctantly set us a table, screeching chairs and banging tables to show us his displeasure. I made some calls and was reassured that we indeed have paid and was entitled to our seats.
The tour guide of the said 200 people tourist groups seem to be acquainted with the male waiter and was pressing him for more tables, I don't know whether there are other deals between them but the waiter was obviously turning down every other customers away from the place to accommodate her tour.
When I told the waiter that I have called the sales team to confirmed again that I have paid. He became very defensive and said he was merely trying to tell me they have two types of booking. Now, it really does not matter to me if there are ten types of booking because when I showed him proof of a genuine booking confirmation, he cannot recognize it.
When the place is overbooked/double booked, I was given zero prior notice and my booking was thrown away like dirt on the spot. They were simply turning paid customers away without proper explanation and alternative arrangements. If I took the waiter's word for it and went elsewhere, I stand to lose time and money.
Now if the 200 people tour did have a booking, and their booking, for some mysterious reasons not disclosed to me, enjoyed a higher priority then mine, they can simply reject my online booking(which was made more than two weeks prior to my visit to the park) or sent me an e-mail to discuss alternative arrangements, they have done neither of that. So I cannot help but think that the tour booking was prioritized for other reasons."
,,Delightful Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"A must for family travelers. 2-3 hours of visit to the park has an exhilarating effect, especially on children. Plan your visit according to the shows that take place here with audiences participating. Feeding the birds out of your hands is a thrill."
,,Fun even for adults,4.0,,I was surprised how much I enjoyed this. We got the tram but I found it did not stop as often as I would have liked so we ended up back tracking a fair amount. The show was fun. Signage for directions could have been a bit better but overall the place was great.
,,"If you like birds, you must see this!",5.0,,"Easy to get to on the East West line and then on a bus.
So many beautiful birds, many parrots in all colours! Lots of Aussie birds, stunning owls, they have snowy owls and they are just beautiful!
They also have a room where you can see all the rooms that the eggs incubate, hatch and the babies grow, its was good to see them at all stages (especially for kids). There was a baby flamingo.. Very cute!

Loads of spots to fill up your drink bottles."
,,Colrful Birds,4.0,,This is a true example of how presentation matters. The way they have presented is truly amazing. Be ready for a good amount of walk. Plan your show times well in advance to avoid walking extensively
,,A Must See When In Singapore.,5.0,,Good collection of birds from around the world and they are well look after. Good for parents with children to visit this place. You get to see bird species up close...
,,Flamingo !!,5.0,,Nothing more I can say with the hundreds or even thousands species of bird in this fantastic Bird Park. Flamingos will easily attract your attention for sure. Lovely!!
,,a zoo just for birds,4.0,,This large bird zoo is quite a long way from the centre of town. It has some really large enclosed walk through aviaries that are fun plus a lot of other individual cages.
,,Amazing Experience,4.0,,If you are a nature lover then this is definitely the place to visit. Even if you are not do visit and fall in love with nature. Jurong Park houses birds of all hues. It is just splendid. The exhibits it has are marvellous. You will find all sorts of birds from cranes to owls to vultures. You can even feed them and hold them for a fee. There are also loads of shows of talking birds or birds performing tricks. Must must visit.
,,Get back to nature,4.0,,"Must visit for adults and kids alike. Wide variety of birds , well displayed and informatively listed. We had originally planned a 2 hour visit but ended up spending half a day ."
,,GREAT PARK,5.0,,It was an amazing experience as we have seen dolphins etc. to be trained but the birds to be trained was excellent. The bird show was AMAZING......... MUST WATCH
,,Spend 6 hours here!,5.0,,"Excellent collection of birds in this Bird Park. Take pictures with Parrots! You can also feed the colorful and friendly Lories! High Flyers show is very entertaining, especially if you are travelling with children."
,,"Truly, a Bird Park!",4.0,,"I would recommend this attraction, esp. for families traveling with children. The place is tourist-friendly, well-maintained and highly educational. With the broad spectrum of bird species it showcases, it truly lives up to its name as a Bird Park!

Just a tip though, raincoats and umbrellas can come in handy with unexpected rainshowers since some walking would be needed."
,,nature at its best.,4.0,,"this bid park is a little bit of paradise for birds. it is wonderful to see them in a natural enviroment, and not in cages.there are many very ununuasl birds of various colours and types.a lovely place for children toget a good appreciation of the birds, that is not to say that adults eyes will be opened with what they see. well worth a visit. something to take about singapore with you."
,,Enjoyed the visit,5.0,,Love my visit here even though it take a little traveling to get to. My suggestion is to go by Taxi as its a good walk from the MRT. Go early and see the Raptor show first the visit the free flying Averies when the other shows are on as the kids tend to go to the shows and its qiueter
,,A great place to view bird life.,3.0,,An enjoyable afternoon or morning out for all the family. The Bird Park is probably rated one of the best in SE Asia. Refreshments are available as are toilet fascilities. Choose a fine but cloudy afternoon to visit as it can get very hot.
,,Amazing way to see birds,5.0,,"What a beautiful place to walk, watch and wonder. The exhibits and feeding sessions are great, but one absolutely shouldn't miss the two shows - High Flyers and King of the Skies. The shows run on two time slots - morning and afternoon at the Hawk Arena and the Pool Amphitheater. The Penguins did look a bit sad, but overall...Absolutely fantastic!"
,,Simply Amasing!,5.0,,Went to see this incredible place before I headed back home that same day. I was advise by my partner not to miss this if I ever visit Singapore and he was certainly right! I was not a big fan of birds but after visiting this place then i cud say i am now. I was utterly in love with the massive aviary with the man made jurong waterfall inside. I kind of felt like I was in the film avatar. The birds were incredible too. There were loads of species there that I havent seen before. The feeling the park gave me was just incredible. And they have free wifi at the reception area that made it more convenient for travellers from abroad. A defo must see and visit in Singapore!
,,"Loved, loved, loved!!",5.0,,"I'm not sure if there are any other parks dedicated to birds only, but this one is amazing! This is one of the four parks of the Singapore Zoo, and is by far, my favorite! Being a bird lover, I was in heaven being surrounded by so many colorful birds. I loved the bird show and being able to have my picture taken surrounded by flamingos. This is a park that is wonderful for adults and children alike!"
,,Where feathers fly,5.0,,To be so close to so many different birds is pure delight. The park is wonderful nothing like it in Australia. Just to see the joy on childrens faces is areal plus.
,,Best Entertainment,5.0,,SAEx bus service is the Best choice for reach the Park. Bird shows are fantastic and best time to be spend 4hours
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Place to visit with your families, friends or just simply by yourself. Many to see and explore the area. Kids will adore the place.. as you can enjoy seeing many birds which is not commonly found in Asia. Go early in the morning while the weather is still nice and not too hot."
,,Not so good anymore.,3.0,,"Went to the bird park, just a week back, and was pretty disappointed that there was almost no noticeable change to the place since my last visit 15 years back.

While there were quite a variety of birds here, most of it can easily be covered and seen within 1-2 hours. The ostrich section and the owl sections were amongst my favourite, although i felt the enclosures to be a little too small for the birds. Also, the bird show with parrot Amigo was pretty impressive and a must-to-see.

For $22, it wasn't too expensive nor cheap, but perhaps more for tourists or families with young kids."
,,Spectacular birds,5.0,,Jurong Bird Park is well worth a visit if you like bird life. They have some very unusual birds of all sizes and colours. The birds of paradise were very colourful and the crowned pigeon was well worth a look as it was quite weird.
,,Nature at its best,5.0,,Oh! the bird shows were excellent. My Grandchildren were soooo happy that they could play and pet the birds
,,Fun and amazing,5.0,,It was fun and highly recommend the Shows for both the High fliers and the Birds of Prey. They birds were amazing and wish I had more time to look around at the different birds they had.
,,Birds from everywhere,4.0,,"Nice tropical park, take half a day to visit it completely and not in a hurry. Showing birds from everywhere in the world, and there are some shows with parrots and hawks. There are some nice and fresh area with shadows that are really appreciate in Singapore."
,,A must see to appreciate the displays,5.0,,This is a large park so wear comfortable shoes. We took the tram ride first to get an overall view of the park. The park is spread over a gully so there is a lot of up and down walking. The aviaries are massive especially the aviary containing the waterfall. Allow at least 4-5 hours minimum to see this and appreciate the bird life. We chose to eat at the outside restaurants after a long tour of the zoo and enjoyed a Bongo Burger - excellent meal and a good way to finish off. We used the MRT and Buses from Orchard Rd to get there and back. Less than $3 ea.
,,a gem - well-run and a visual delight,4.0,,"fabulous place - especially for children! The show birds are extraordinary (how did they train them to do that?!) and even though it was very crowded when we went (it was national holiday weekend), everything was well maintained and well run. A great day out, with marvellous landscaping."
,,Doesn't live up to potential,3.0,,"When you compare this place to the zoo or River Safari, I would say that it's quite a disappointment. The 2nd time I've been here seems like the place has deteriorated. Although they seem to have renovated the place, the birds' pens smell. Tried feeding the lories this time but they seemed disinterested and seems that there are a lot fewer of them around now."
,,must visit,5.0,,a must visit specially when travelling with the kids it has so many beautiful birds and its very well maintained park. Though in the month of june it was very humid and sunny.
,,Amazingly Colourful Display of Aviary Species,5.0,,"If you have never been to any bird park before, then I would strongly recommend that you visit this one as the number of birds on display, the quality of the shows, the lorry loft, the beautiful walking routes, all are par excellence. I just fell in love with the place."
,,Bird lovers rejoice,4.0,,Great place for all bridge lovers. They have a massive collection of species and they seem to be well taken care of.
,,Worth a visit :),4.0,,The Bird Park is well worth a visit. The format is the same as the Singapore Night Safari but it works well. It's comfortable to walk around and there's a few very good sections. There are some good live shows but these fill up quickly so make sure that you get there early!
,,Best bird park ever,5.0,,This is a park for all. They have birds in the open that we can feed and touch. Some even will fly and sit on your hands or shoulders.
,,Bird nerd nirvana,5.0,,"This is a bird nerd nirvana. Jurong Bird Park has great viewing of a wide range of birds, from Parrots to Birds of Prey. The shows are also excellent and allows visitors to see birds in action up close. The main negative is getting too and from can be a bit painful."
,,Bird Paradise,4.0,,"Time your visit with the shows. We reached when high flyers show was about to start, we saw the show and then started the tour. The amphitheater is very near entrance so makes sense to cover this rather than walking back to be in time for the show.

You can either cover through tram or walk down. It was very humid when we visited and we took a tram though it can easily be covered by walking as well. Highlight for me was the loris loft area where you can literally have the birds eating out of your hands and the waterfall area..both of these are adjacent to tram stations. Carry water and lots of it..we were literally dehydrated post our visit!!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Excellent zoo for birds. I guess zoo, I don't k now if it just birds is it called a park instead of zoo? No matter what you call it, lots of well birds of all types. Pretty amazing if you like wildlife, what more can you really say, really nice grounds, well laid out with some really impressive birds. Excellent zoo or park. Highly recommended"
,,JURONG BIRD PARK VISIT EARLY BEFORE THE CROWDS,5.0,,"This is a superb bird park, well maintained with natural surroundings for the birds, that lets you experience them up and close and personal. We decided to get there right on opening, which was the best thing we did. The park was quiet for the first two hours which meant you could see the birds in a relaxed quiet manner, this added to the experience and made the visit."
,,Highs and lows,3.0,,"There are some great bits of this bird park, it is not too big so easy to navigate, the loris loft is lovely as is the waterfall area. The shows were ok but a bit old fashioned. Overall it was a nice place to visit, but actually we didn't enjoy it as a family and left early. Somehow it just wasn't up to the standard of the zoo etc."
,,Best value among the zoo attractions,5.0,,"This is the least well-publicized of the zoo-related attractions in Singapore (the Singapore Zoo, the Night Safari, and the River Safari are the others), but is my favourite,and easily the best value for the money. If you're a tourist with 24 hours in Singapore, then skip this and pay the $ for the Night Safari, but if you have some time or live here and have kids, it's really fun."
,,nice,4.0,,"like this place. you can contact nature there. if you are not scare, you can contact parrot directly! you can take nice pics there!"
,,A wonderful experience for the whole family !,3.0,,"This is a wonderful place to visit in Singapore particularly if you have kids. The park is quite vast (hilly terrain type) and though they have a Tram ride to take you around the park, you may miss most of the areas if you use the Tram. Basically there are important things you must not miss in this park a) Lori Loft (Lorikeet feeding area) b) Waterfall area c) Bird shows.

At the Lorikeet feeding area you can get a bird feed for about S$3 per cup. You can see thousands of birds and these birds are human friendly too. They would mingle with you and even jump on your shoulders and head. Lots of photo shoot opportunity would be available here. It is worth spending some good time here particularly if you have kids.

The waterfall area is again a covered area with lots of Birds. It would be worthwhile to carry a Binaculars to watch some of the birds here.

Then there are Bird shows at designated times lasting for about 30-40 minutes. These shows are fantastic and not to be missed.

Other than these, the park is quite normal like other bird parks with a variety of caged birds. Depending on ones interest, you may spend a whole day also. Generally you may require about 4 hours to cover the park. Overall, this is a fantastic place, lots of greenery around and you can see lots of birds around the park in its natural environment."
,,Birdy Beautiful!,5.0,,Jump in a cab or catch a bus. Its a really good park done in classy Singapore style and very beautiful and educational. Kids will delight in the experience.
,,Great bird park,4.0,,"Come prepared to walk a lot - there is a helpful tram which we didnt take and regretted later, the park is great for children, we were part of some of the shows and they are very well done. The lory enclosure is a fun place to view colorful birds."
,,The kids are curious with the big bird cage.,5.0,,Very worth seeing for a family with kids and they will learn to love the birds and nature. Everything is in smooth operation.
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Very enjoyable. Pretty crowded but worth it. Funny show with birds, a must see for children (very engaging). Good atmosphere."
,,DO NOT BUY THE TRAIN TICKET. BRING SUNSCREEN LOTION.,5.0,,"The main path of the park is around 1.6 kilometers long. That is a very short distance to walk.

If you buy the train ticket, you will miss out on basically EVERYTHING.

When we arrived, the train queue was completely full. The employee said the wait time was around 15 minutes... well guess what, 20 minutes later and we were only 50% of the way through. We decided to leave the queue and just walk - great choice.

BRING SUNSCREEN LOTION.
The little gift shop guy sells sunscreen for $30. Forget that it is overpriced: It is BAD FOR SENSITIVE SKIN. I had a burning sensation after putting it on my face. It is supposed to be for face & body, and is marketed as KIDS sunscreen. Do yourself a favor and bring your own. You will need it on a sunny day.

The park itself is interesting. I have never been to a place like this. The highlights:

1. Lorikeet feeding area:
Lorikeets fly around, and some will come to you. You can buy a cup of sugar water for $3 to feed them. I recommend not trying to touch them unless you want your fingers bitten. (I don't mind, and they do not draw blood. I was bitten by over 5 birds for trying to touch them.) I just moved my finger very slowly to them. I was not harassing them, they simply did not want to be touched that way.

They are very cute, but please don't try to touch them if you are sensitive to bites. :) If you can handle it, maybe you'll find a gentle one. One of them actually followed my finger to chew on it, and was disinterested in the sugar water - I was holding the sugar water cup, NOT trying to touch it. Maybe it's a game to them?

Some birds will jump on your head, body, shoulder... Some birds will lick your sweat. (Please don't let the birds lick you if you have applied sunscreen.) The birds jump off you to poo away from you, 90% of the time from what I have noticed.

2. Waterfall area, wild birds roaming around
Plenty of birds roaming around this area on the trails. You can get pretty close to them, but not too close.

My girlfriend managed to take a picture with a peacock 1 foot away. You need to approach them very slowly, and not follow them if they are scared. I think there is an interactive feeding event at certain times, when you can feed them alongside park workers. This is worth looking into.

3. The other birds
Nothing much to say, they are just in cages or large gated enclosures (pelicans, ostriches, flamingos, etc.)

Gift shop:
Singapore's souvenirs seem to be mainly low-quality and overpriced... In comparison, the South Korean souvenirs are of a far higher quality. The best things here are probably the bird plush toys.

Photos:
Some workers will roam around and take photos of tourists. I recommend having a photo taken if you don't have a selfie stick, as these look much better than ones you take with the front of your phone. I believe it costs around $45 for 2 photos and a frame. Far better than the low quality souvenirs. :)

Weather:
Expect to be there for around 1-2 hours. More if you want to eat / stay for feeding shows, etc. Bring sunscreen lotion, mosquito repellent (tiger balm), etc. You can buy drinks and some food there. I did not try the food...

Overall:
This was the funnest place I visited in Singapore. The S.E.A. aquarium was a huge disappointment, worth 2/5 stars at most. The Jurong bird park, on the other hand, is a unique experience that is worth the money and time."
,,Lory Fun & Great Shows!,5.0,,"I have always loved coming to Singapore's Jurong Bird Park. Because it's SG50 this year, we got the annual pass for $28 per pax.

The shows never seem to bore me. I had a good time at the Pelican Cove seeing the pelicans feed. Apparently they can fill 13 litres of water in its bill! The High Flyers show was equally fun.

This time, we gave the Kings of the Skies Show a miss to do the Lory feeding which came free when we bought the annual pass.The lory feeding is an absolutely must do even though you need to pay a nominal fee for food on normal days.

In all in, a fantastic place to be. Just that it can get really hot and that's when you go join the penguins to cool down."
,,Great Attraction for Children,4.0,,So many bird species to look at. We rode a tram that will take you to stops you can hop out to view different stations which you are more interested at. I guess what the park needs is more street shows of that sort.
,,Great place,5.0,,"Great place to interact with nature and to learn about fauna. Kids really enjoy the day at this place, it is one of must visit place of Singapore."
,,Birds park !,5.0,,A nice place for people who love to be part of nature .. Bird feeding is the most attractive stuff I found there where parrots would fly n come near to you .. Bird show and lots kind of birds ... A must visit ..
,,Bird lover,5.0,,Very well maintained. Lots of species of birds. Very sweet staff. Worth every penny you pay to visit there.
,,Beautiful place to see birds of all kinds,5.0,,This happens to be an amazing place where you can find regular bird shows. There are few stadia for viewing this & the shows are organised in periodic intervals of time. It is a wonderful & scenic place for the children. There is toy train running inside the park.
,,Close up with the birds,5.0,,"The highlight of the visit to the Jurong bird park is the Lori Garden. These little birds are amazingly friendly. It's a must do. Be prepared to spend at least half an hour there.
The tram service is frequent, but there should be at least twice the number of stops."
,,kings of the sky show,5.0,,This is a long shot. I am hoping that someone out there was at the kings of the sky show on 2015 at the 10am show.. I was in the show with Hazel the vulture and the video my son took didnt work and I have no photos of it. I am hoping someone may have taken some and be willing to send them to me. It isnt everyday you have a vulture on your arm. I would be eternally grateful. My email addressis sharonmaree65@gmail.com thanks. We thourghly enoyed Jurong Bird Park we spent the entire day there. The bird shows were excellent and the grounds were so beautiful. I loved the walk in avery . My son especially loved the penguins and the toucans and macaws. The play area is great for the kids to cool off. My son got wetand walked around the park wet so that he wouldnt be as hot. I would highly recommend going there.
,,Awful,1.0,,"I try to find the positive in most things, but I have to say I hated this place. Huge Eagles in tiny glass cages slightly larger than their wing span, made me so sad that every other collection of birds felt wrong. Maybe it has changed in the past year, as everyone else seems to love it."
,,"Need a cash card to enter Carpark, Malaysian cars be careful.",3.0,,"One of the oldest bird park and my husband's font childhood memory. Revisited after 30 years, still well kept and maintained. Shows are excellent. But i wish the birds at the lory loft could be more. Another advice to Malaysians who drove to Birdpark, be reminded that you need to have cash card to access the carpark as there are no other alternatives. We had been using auto pass to access carparks elsewhere, suddenly we were not able to enter this after a long journey. Have to detour another long journey to get a cash card and it cost us another hour plus… And the carpark machine sometimes is misleading. It supposed to be SGD2 per entrance but it showed ""payment per hour started.."" we were in great shock and was not sure we have adequate money in cash card or not. Luckily the staffs at the customer service especially the supervisor is very helpful and help us sorted the problem.
I think the bird park and car park authorities should really reconsider payment alternatives for visitors to park their car."
,,great day out for the family : education and entertainment,4.0,,"Excellent experience. Well kept birds, good and spacious enclosures. Clear that keepers have good knowledge about bird needs and care enough to bring the best out of them."
,,For nature lovers,4.0,,"Must visit location as part of your Singapore visit , the entire place is done up so well complete greenery. You get to see birds close. There are shows which are very entertaining. Kids would love the park. There are trams that take you around the park, making it comfortable to get a complete view."
,,"Amazing collection of birds""",5.0,,Spent all day here. Fabulous range of birds and easy to view. You will not necessarily need binoculars but they would help to see the. Odours and finer detail of birds.
,,Wonderful place to spend your day,5.0,,"It's not only the world's largest bird park but it's also very clean and nicely maintained. The shows are awesome and the kids will enjoy. There are 5,000 birds of 400 species in Jurong Bird Park.

Lory Loft is the world's largest walk-in flight aviary for lories and lorikeets, with over 1,000 free-flying lories. We always enjoy feeding the birds here. If you like taking pictues, do bring your zoom lenses. Lot of food choices to have but bit costly. You can bring your own food too and there are beautiful places to sit and eat watching the birds.

Finally we take our daughter for the beautiful water playground inside. While we can sit and have a sip of coffee and snacks, the kids will enjoy playing in the water."
,,A must do!!!,5.0,,One of the best places to visit in singapore!! Has the most amazing shows!! Delight for the kids and the adults too😄😄 Birds of paradise... N lory feeding not to be missed!!
,,"Enjoy the birds, but bring plenty of water",4.0,,"The bird park is not as diverse as the zoo or the night zoo in Singapore, but bird lovers and casual visitors are both catered for. Don't miss the hatchery where you can see chicks of all types, including strange, large-headed awkward parrot chicks--the ones that grow up into multi-colored beauties."
,,Birds of Prey show excellent!,4.0,,"This was the only ""zoo"" we didn't make it to last time, so thought this was a good way to spend our one day in Singapore. Like the other zoos it is laid out in a circle route making it easy to see everything. The Bird of Prey show was the best and the spot on the far left where we sat when no one else was, was perfect for having the birds fly a couple of feet above you. The hatchling (?) centre was excellent not just because it is air-conditioned. You can see staff feeding the baby birds and there is plenty of information.
We recommend anyone interested in bird, with younger children or have already done the other zoos to go to the bird park, it was an excellent way to fill most of a day."
,,Nice and friendly,5.0,,"You can interact with the birds and take photos with them, clean and great environment. They can actually train the bird without abusing it!"
,,Just amazing!,5.0,,We didn't think the spark would be so big and we were amazed to be able to see birds of paradise. We only had 3 1/2 hours there but definitely needed more time. The high flyers show is great too.
,,Wonderful bird park worth a visit,5.0,,"Wonderful collection of birds, a pleasant change from the zoo. Nice place to walk around. The kids will enjoy their visit"
,,Bird lovers do not miss this,5.0,,The show they put on was an absolute winner with a big wow factor. If you have a half day free spend it here. The mall at Boon Lay where get off the MRT at is well worth exploring
,,jurooong birdy,5.0,,"must visit place if ur in singapore must have atleat one day to go through all shows, u can take the train which also a convenient way to get transferred, watch the artificial water-fall, the parrots show."
,,Worth a visit with children,5.0,,"Really interesting. Great for children as it is very child-friendly, buggies for the kids available and a play area."
,,A good day out,4.0,,Nice selection of birds and a beautifully presented park. Waterfall was great to look at and see the African birds. Tram ride is a great way to get around on a hot day. Food was expensive and Taxis are very hard to get at the Taxi rank. Reserve 1 prior to pick you up at closing time
,,JUST WOW,4.0,,I have never seen so many species of Birds at one location. Best way to visit is to take a walk through. Must watch the bird shows.
,,JURONG BIRD PARK,5.0,,"Its a nice bird park for bird lovers, you need to have atleast 3 hours to see it completely. Its far away from down town Singapore. You need to go to Boon Lay MRT Station from there at Bus Interchange you need to take Bus no 194 which takes you to Jurong Bird Park."
,,Fun and relaxing but water park need to maintain,4.0,,"We are regulars to the bird park, having visits of 5 or more times per year due to company pass.

Today just visit again and main reason is to let the kids play at the water park. The water park is fun and less crowded than the one at zoo, but i also noticed the flooring was not maintained well and a lot cracks and unevenness. This can pose danger to kids.

Other than that, the water playground is better managed because there is a staff stationed on the slide unlike the other one at zoo.

Since they stop the sky train few years ago we are dusappointed because it was one of the plus point due to aircon sky train whereas the tram now provided is still hot (non aircon).

Attractions we love the feed the birds at lory stop but we missed it today because too much time at the water playground."
,,MUST FOR BIRD LOVERS,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park houses many species of Birds from all over the World . Layout of the Park , briefs about all Birds & their Habitat makes it a worthwhile visit .
Live show with Birds is also a must see to watch playful Birds .
The Bird Park is well kept & a visit is almost like an outing in the wild."
,,A Day out with the Birds!,4.0,,"Visited Jurong Bird Park on 17 July 2015 and really enjoyed the trip. This place has a huge collection of exotic birds and it is worth a visit especially with the kids. The Bird show is fantastic and you can see so many flamingoes & pelicans and parrots. One must definitely sit on the Tram ride which goes round the park and gives a cmmentary of the place. It can be very hot and humid so make sure you bring an umbrella and drinking water with you. A portable fan would be good to have to cool you down.
If you cannot stand the heat then go visit the Penguin Enclosure as it is air-conditioned. Kids will definitely enjoy this place!"
,,Romantic place,4.0,,"I see a lot of couple holding hand in here, you have to see the bird show or it's just a nice place with large park"
,,Beautiful day out,5.0,,"We loved this place! Took the MRT from the city to the nearest station, then a bus to the Park. The kids loved the Penguin enclosure and all the birds - but most of all, the water playground! So don't forget to pack swimming clothes and enjoy the experience!"
,,Another waste of time and money...,2.0,,"I last visited the Jurong Bird Park in 2012 and really enjoyed the experience despite not actually being the biggest fan of birds or being a fan of bird in enclosed spaces. This visit was less than pleasant for a number of reasons...

Firstly, that great capitalist enterprise Wildlife Reserves Singapore have scored another great point for capitalism. Entry fees are extortionate and food and beverage (they've got you trapped again!) are outrageously overpriced.

The park is dirty and not well kept anymore. The sense of lack of care was evident throughout. Attractions are really showing their age. The pelican pool for example was covered in algae and stank as the water was almost completely stagnant.

However, true capitalism really came into its own at the entrance way. An opportunity for to have pictures taken with parrots was ruined when a single picture was offered to us at the absolutely eye watering, mouth dropping price of S$70!!!!

Until Wildlife Reserve Singapore gets its act in order and rethinks the way it charges people (yes these things should cost money but seriously folks....) tourists should avoid, avoid, avoid!"
,,A Unique Bird Park,4.0,,"Located in the western corner of Singapore is the Jurong Bird Park. It has a huge collection of exotic birds and is a place for birds lovers. The kids were excited initially but interested waned as the hot sun sapped their energy.

The must see at the Bird Park - the Parrot Paradise. The kids were excited by the energy and colors.

Pack a change of clothes for the kids so that they can play at the water slides and fountains at Birdz of Play. It was a great way to cool off too.

There are 2 shows - the High Flyers and Kings of the Sky. If you have time for only one, don't miss the High Flyers show with the macaw, toucans and hornbills, flamingoes. The kids loved the colors and flying displays. Stay behind after the shows for photo with the birds. The kids thought it was the best moment to be so close to the birds.

Although the Bird Park is not large, it can still be a challenge to walk. Hop on and off the tram. Pack a snack and bring lot of drinks. Food outlets are limited at the Park and prices very high.

Booked the tickets online and enjoyed a 10% discount. With a Singapore credit card, the discount was 30%. Even with a 10% discount, it was substantial savings for a family of 4.

Overall, an enjoyable experience for the family."
,,An eye Opener!!,5.0,,i never knew there are still so many exotic bird species in the world! a very educating and informative visit to the bird park. very relaxing environment to take in all the birds around you. Highly recommended for for family with kids!!!
,,JURONG BIRD PARK A MUST SEE PLACE IN SINGAPORE >,4.0,,"Jurong Bird park singapore is a very attractive park . where you will find birds from all over the world .A place of children's interest too . where children""s can touch and play with birds."
,,Family place,4.0,,"Bird showed is good and all collection bird is fantastic,maybe need more place for eat & drinks and have a disc program for the tickets"
,,Awesome exoerience,5.0,,"This place is far better than what I expected.
A great collection of rare and exotic birds including birds of paradise.
Enclosures fit for royalty leaving nothing out to make the birds as home as possible
The parrot done was enormous and also an opportunity to feed the birds and let them chirp loudly inches from you. Loved the experience and highly recommended for any visitors to Singapore. They go all out for their wildlife."
,,Birds of many feathers are fabulous to see,4.0,,"If you like birds this is a fabulous place to visit! There are toucans at the entry. Macaws that will sit on your shoulder or arm. A pond full of pink flamingos (I just love their reverse knees!). Eagles, Don't miss the bird show. It can be hot in the Singapore climate if it's a sunny day."
,,Bird Paradise.,4.0,,"A well known attraction of SG. Clever use of natural gradients. Variety of Birds mainly Parrot family. The Bird shows are well organised and entertain visitors.

Dislike : Location is bit away by SG standerd. One needs to use multipal modes of transport ,if on Budget."
,,Jurong Bird Park Safari,5.0,,"This is a place you can not afford to miss. More so when you travel with families. This is perhaps one of the largest free flying bird parks of the world. Located in Jurong East, this park houses more than 5000 birds with over 400 species and sub - species. THe park also proudly boasts of the world's highest man - made waterfall that is sure to set your mind aflutter. I would personally recommend the penguin coast and the penguin feeding sessions, the flamingo lake and the pelican cove. There are bird shows twice daily which you should not miss. And before you leave, take your children to the bird theme based water park where the children's laughter and joy is sure to melt your hearts. Welcome to the Jurong Bird Park."
,,One of my favorite childhood experiences,4.0,,"They had such a welcoming entrance and the staff was really friendly. And of course they had a huge variety of birds all over the park. Soo many colorful birds, some I've never even heard of. Near the end of the tour I even got the chance to take a picture with a bellbird on my forehand."
,,The Best bird park I have been to,4.0,,"It was by far the best bird park I have visited, what I liked the most was that the birds were given the natural environment to live. The shows the do ate not to be missed, my kids loved it so did I. Only 2 things that bothered me was lack of vegetarian food options and pathetically managed taxi queue system. You will need at least 4 to 5 hours to cover the park at ease."
,,I Love the Bird Park,5.0,,I love the bird park. I've been there twice now as we got a season pass as part of the SG50 special back in December. There are so many attractions and birds to see. There are areas where you are with the birds flying around in the wild. Most of the exhibits don't feel like there is an enclosure so that is a good feeling for the animals. It's a large place so my wife and I did the entire park in 2 visits. You'll probably either have to take a bus or taxi there unless you have a car. I'd recommend spending 3-4 hours there to see the whole park and bring lots of water. The bird shows can be fun too but it can be hot just sitting in those outdoor theater areas.
,,One of my son's favorites,5.0,,"It's quite a unique place dedicated to birds. It's quite normal for a city to have a Zoo, but having a Bird Park is rare. Spare half a day for a stroll, feeding activities and shows. One can easily spend the whole day as well, especially if you are with kids and plan to visit the children's waterplay. Please beware of heat and take a rest in multiple shades or air conditioned places."
,,A real surprise,4.0,,Don't listen to any comments saying the place is run down. It's a truly amazing experience. Well worth the visit. The bird show is really good. Suggest visiting at 9am to avoid the crowds.
,,Good Tourist Attraction,4.0,,"A very laid out park, with a huge variety of birds to view and interact with up close. Some very good shows as well."
,,Great park with fun shows but food is very expensive.,4.0,,Great bird park. Can get excessively crowded and very hot. Take your own drinks and food as the prices in the park are outrageous. Worth a visit. The shows are very good and are a must
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,Beautiful gardens and surroundings. The birds are well looked after and the staff very helpful and knowledgeable. Make sure you leave enough time as it is a large property
,,Worth A Visit!,4.0,,"Although away from most other tourist attractions in Singapore being located at Jurong (I believe they're going to move it closer to the zoo), the Jurong Bird Park is definitely worth a visit!

The highlight for us was the live bird show with a talking Amazonian Parrot as well as some other cool birds that fly over your head.

My only dislike was the hour and a half long train and bus ride to get us to the park. The park itself is fantastic.

I recommend taking a picnic lunch to save paying inflated food and drink prices."
,,Wide variety of birds,4.0,,A great place to see a variety of birds but beware at times you can be bitten by mosquitoes! Take care in the rain too as the paths can be a little slippery!
,,zoo and safari,5.0,,"interesting place Approx three hours is enough time to enjoy the place. Ensure u check attractions and show timings on the net before u venture out. If going with the kids there is a kiddie area where there are fun activities. Buy a online combo pass for all 4 attractions in S'pore - zoo, night safari, river safari. Enjoy!!"
,,Very good- dont miss the shows,5.0,,"Excellent! Agin dont miss the shows- they are too good, so time accordingly. Nature walk and bird feeding is another experience. Kid love the experience."
,,Excellent Bird Park,4.0,,"20 mins drive from our hotel and wasn't disappointed. An excellent variety of birds from around the world and some huge walk in aviary's which was special.Particularly liked the aviary with the waterfall, needed to cool down as the day we went was 34 degrees. You could take the train around if you were struggling with walking, it is a good sized park and plenty to see. There is also a big children's area to occupy the kids for a while and as mentioned on the day we went the kids loved the water features. Overall we spent a few hours here and thoroughly enjoyed it Well worth the admission fee."
,,It's Worth It!,5.0,,"A day at the Jurong Bird Park was worth every minute spent!

What a beautiful place to walk, watch and wonder. The exhibits and feeding sessions are great, but one absolutely shouldn't miss the two shows - High Flyers and King of the Skies. The shows run on two time slots - morning and afternoon at the Hawk Arena and the Pool Amphitheater. The Penguins did look a bit sad, but overall...Absolutely fantastic!"
,,paradise in Singapore,5.0,,I think Jurong Bird Park is the brightest feather in the crown of Singapore.Birds birds and only birds.The varietion of colur and types increase our excitement.Various birds show s are another attraction of the park.
,,A cute bird park!,5.0,,Kids will like it here with some cute bird shows. The whole family will like it if you exclude the hot Singapore climate 😊
,,Great bird show but park feels outdated,4.0,,"The bird show was almost worth the price of admission alone. It was great seeing the interactions between the keepers and the birds, and it is very interactive with the audience.

The rest of the park is good with the birds being kept in very large cages. However, due to the cages, it was very difficult to take good photos of the birds (photography was one of the main reasons I went in the first place). The larger birds and the Lory Loft were great.

The park layout is quite confusing, and most would often have to constantly backtrack in order to see all exhibits. It might be more worthwhile if a recommended route was drawn on the map to show the most efficient way of getting around without the constant backtracking in the hot humid weather that Singapore has."
,,"""Best Bird Park in the World""",5.0,,"My favourite were the pink flamingos & colours of the parrots and then all the little penguin's. The waterfall so high, with birds flying every were - the love bridge."
,,Amazing bird park a must visit for every body,5.0,,"You want to get amazed again and againg, visit Jurong bird park at Singapore, how they teach the birds to perfection? how they go the bird show at the end of the tour in amphe theatre? just no anwers!, if you visit Singapore and don't go to Jurong? it the last mistakat you would want to do."
,,Great day out for family,5.0,,Great shows and gardens. great for kids. Really enjoyed the bird shows Great variety of birds on display
,,World of Birds,4.0,,We are glad that the birds looked healthy with vibrant colours. We are happy for the new attractions and the bird show was fantastic with good humour. The walk was relaxing and the sight of birds everywhere was like a walk in the forest. Great place to visit for family and friends.
,,Do check the show timings when planning to visit this,5.0,,"Do not miss the shows.Please plan your trip as per the show timing and be there to experience some good time with cute,beautiful birds.Even the host of show is very entertaining."
,,best bird park,5.0,,"You can see all species of parrots talk with them , click photos with them, also pink flamingos and other birds, a small waterfall inside, and a bird show at amphitheater a must watch show."
,,Best bird park in singapore,5.0,,Here you will find the most of the bird species around the world.the more exciting here is there is penguin over here which are kept under -10 degree celsius.
,,A wonderful place to be In,4.0,,Its the place where any adult like us becomes kids. It took us nano second for us to be kids. Its a wonderful place where excitement is built through watching all those birds which we have often only read or seen or heard in books. A lovely place for kids and all.
,,Super fun,5.0,,"I'm impress with the clean and tidy space they manage. they have colorful parrots inside the big dome. what more can i say, its a bird park."
,,Walk-walk-walk,3.0,,A lot of walking just to see some birds but also empty cages. Clean as everywhere in Singapore but from my point of wiew you rely need to be an appassionated birdspotter to really enjoy this attraction.
,,The Best !,5.0,,Probably the best place in Singapore to visit. Visited with family and felt bad that we could spend only 3 hours here. One whole day would be required to admire the beauty of this place and to spend quality time with the birds. A must visit place and your Singapore trip would be incomplete if you to visit this place. Highly Recommended !
,,Its a Paradise of Birds,4.0,,Ideal for family trips. There are variety of birds you can see. Most of the birds you can see without a cage that seems very interesting.
,,Feast for your eyes,5.0,,"pretty,cute,beautiful,adorable...get up and close with the Lory Birds. Dont miss this, especially if you are going with kids. The shows are too good, mainly the one with parakeets and macau. Lots of flamingos.Excellent place - My daughter wouldnt leave. Promised to take her again."
,,Must-see for bird lovers,5.0,,"In case yu are a bird-lover you must go to this place (foresee a whole day). I recommend making the tour counter-clockwise, since you may get a wrong impression of birds being imprisoned to to narrow spaces if you take the tour in the other direction. Bring you photo gear!"
,,Worthy visit ...,5.0,,"Wow, the park situatted in the busiest city, total atmoshphere changed when you entered inside the park, reall they maintained well and the team organised the bird feed shows. The types of birds available inside is just amazed and every bird from the globe are very worthy watching. Bird shows are excellent and the team work is superb co-ordination in single peace of work, all the time they smile and explain the history of the birds, really i visit again in future ...."
,,Bird lovers paradise,5.0,,"I spent the best part of a day there.You can walk around ,take the tram or ride the mono rail.The walk way through the tree tops is fascinating ,there is the pelican feeding show and at the end of your walk a music backed show of the carnivores in the bird world.I took the train there easy and quick."
,,If it's a bird it's most likely there.,5.0,,"This wonderland probably doesn't have 'every' bird but it must come closer.
It makes the KL Bird Park look small and amateurish ( but don't let this put you off KL ).
There is a brilliant hummingbird enclose is you fancy trying to actually see one flying. It's like they 'appear' where they are going because they are just so fast.
The penguin enclosure is supreme. It's at the entrance so you don't waste any time getting your socks knocked off. Put this place on your list."
,,Aviary Flights,4.0,,"The Striking Colours of Various Bird Specie is indeed a visual treat. Birds Habitat in the Aviary are well managed and Park management provides the best care. Timings are set for Visitors to Feed them. Feeding and the Flight of Birds enthralls the children. People usually walk around the pathways towards the lakes and cages at their leisure.
For Easy going tourists , park has arrangement for a Toy Train which is a 30minute ride with Informative guide on birds. These Rides start from Parks entrance and are included in your ticket. They take you around the Differnt Routes and blocks of the Aviary.
Greenery is well maintained all around, the Tropical Silence is broken many a times by the Chirping , Hooting and Buzzing by the Feather Friends !"
,,very unique,5.0,,"best to arrive in the morning, to avoid heat and crowds. morning bird feeding and shows are also easier to handle"
,,Bird Heaven,5.0,,"Again so may variety of birds in one location never seen before great show held with pics of flamingos,and parakeets toucans etc,kids loved it."
,,An amazing place with a fantastic atmosphere,5.0,,"We were very impressed with the park, the staff were extremely helpful, and the people involved in the live shows made it so entertaining - the stars of the show undoubtedly were the birds. The variety of bird-life is amazing, so colourful and entertaining and they all have their own way of communicating with varying calls and sounds. We spent a full day there and could have spent longer. Jurong Bird Park is a must do for all the family."
,,A place not to be missed in Singapore!!,5.0,,"Jurong bird park is a beautiful place to visit with family esp. with children where you get to see lots and lots of species of birds esp. penguins,flamingos,lories,hornbills in both caged and natural environment

If you have a day and night to spend, I would recommend to choose Bird park with night safari.

Though there is a tram service inside the park, I would recommend to take a stroll around with a map in hand where you can get to see all the kinds of birds.If you have little kids rent a stroller.To cover the entire park you will need 5- 6 hours and additional 45 min each for two shows - ""High Flyers Show"" - a not to be missed attraction and ""Kings of the Skies"" with hawks and vultures in dramatic action.Both these shows are free..

The other show ""Lunch with parrots"" comes with a cost and looks expensive

Try your hands with feeding the birds which is really interesting

You can take a bus to Night safari directly from the park @ 6 SGD per person

Dont forget to take some really awesome and memorable snaps with birds !!"
,,Nice park,3.0,,We arrived one hour to closing so didn't see a lot of the shows and features. Pretty diverse collection of birds and enjoyable for little kids
,,just bird park..,3.0,,"under expectation. the trip quite far from the city and what i meet here really under my expectation.
first, it is not so clean like others attactions
second, maybe because zoo is zoo.. the concept is like usual concept of zoo with bird inside cage or their habitat etc.
if i ask my kid, area which is quite fun for them is penguin area, the lorry area (because they can give food to them) and the snow owl..."
,,Excellent Park ever,5.0,,"I visited this place many times in past 5 yrs. Every time I went there with my hubby, my 7 members of family and with friends. We always started the day early likes we all arrived just a few minutes before this place opening. We all enjoyed the birds and other animals which treat very well until the end of the day. It's kinda place that you must visit once then you will understand why I kept going back and also brought all my visitors friends and members of family there."
,,Must Visit,5.0,,The bird park has so many birds in it my favorite is the pinguin and the SKY King performance very good for childern ^^
,,Another disappointment,1.0,,I feel sorry for the huge birds that are caged up and don't even have place to move around. The entry fees is so high and i dont see any comfort offered to the birds who reside here. Poor owls are put in glass cubicles which is just 300sqft. This place is terrible.
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"I brought my boys there on 12th June 2015. We plan to have a good bonding time together walking around the park as the last time we went to the bird park was many years ago. Unfortunately it was raining quite heavily when we reached there. So we decided to take the tram first while waiting for the rain to stop.
The rain stopped, the weather was quite cooling after the rain. We walked around for a while and my kids just can't wait to go to the wet pool. So we head to the wet pool and they spent almost the whole afternoon in the pool. They were having so much fun. I thought we went for the bird park for the birds and the man made waterfall, but we spent majority of the time in the pool.
Parents with young kids do get prepared, once the kids were in the pool, you definitely going to have a tough time to get them out of the pool. They are having so much fun that they forgot we wee in the bird park. They just enjoy the water play. Kids in the water play must be in proper swim wear attire.
For locals, you can purchase a annual pass for the price of one entry, so it is very worth it. The promotion is till end of the year."
,,Visit,3.0,,In the Jurong Bird Park we can saw so many different bird and plant. That is a so great and nice place to visit
,,not impressed with this bird park.,3.0,,This is big park is truly devoted to different birds. The maintenance needs to be improved...Intersting part is the live shows of feats of the birds. The trainers should be well apprecited.
,,Disappointing to say the least,2.0,,We went there once and never came back - it is just in summary not worth the money and time. But thats just our opinion. First and foremost we feel that we were ripped off with the entrance fee and the cost of drinks and food there - for what it has to offer.
,,Excellent Getaway with kids,4.0,,"If you have kids between 4-12years old, this will be one exciting attraction you can spent quality time with your family."
,,Greatest Bird Park One can See,5.0,,"Been here twice.... Still would like to visit again for shear grand & panoramic views.

I've been here twice in almost gap of 8 years, The variety of species of birds still amazes you till depth of your soul.

One need not be a bird watcher to be here. A must do thing when visiting Singapore for 1st, 2nd or even 100th time.

Negative - Not much variation seen in these 8 years"
,,Fun trip with kids,5.0,,I took my kids to Jurong Bird Park for a couple of hours in June. Unfortunately we chose to go on a ridiculously hot day which made walking around somewhat bothersome but the place is truly amazing. We could definitely have spent longer than the 2 hours we had there so I would recommend a half day to really soak it all in. The park also has a great waterplay area so don't forget bathers for the kids! Great way to cool down.
,,Never miss this!!,5.0,,"I always love going back to thsi place. One of the largest Bird parks, amazing array of Birds The Bird show is such a lovely sight. Kids would love this place"
,,What an experience walking around. Beautiful colorful birds and many shows to entertain visitors,5.0,,Njoyed all the shows and the walks around the aviaries. Clean and well kept . Restaurants well catered for the tourists. Can't say anything negative.
,,Colourful and full of characters,5.0,,"The displays of large birds were well-designed for maximum visibility and ""home comforts"" for these birds. All was lush and made for a beautiful tropical walk."
,,Great park for a day trip,5.0,,Very diverse range of birds with good facilities for them too. Huge (9 story high) avery with waterfalls. Very much supporting amimal welfare and conservation. Great shows. Easy to get to via train and bus. Definitely worth a visit if you have a spare day in Singapore
,,A Great Place to visit,5.0,,Loved it. Walking through the park seeing the Flamingos was my highlight what a graceful bird. Lunch with parrots was fun they are very cheeky. Great place to take the kids. We caught the MRT and then a bus straight to the park.
,,Nice birds but not friendly to young toddlers.,4.0,,"Love the birds and shows at the bird park. However, the place is not really friendly to toddler younger than 2 years old. There's not many sheltered walkway in certain part of the park. Bringing stroller into the show area also have issues. Overall, love the whole collection of birds."
,,Interesting couple of hours.,4.0,,"Like most zoos you can see areas that specialise in certain types of birds, like birds of pray, owls and exotic birds of paradise. But what really impressed me most is a lot of the areas were open spaces were birds were free to fly away, never to be seen from again. However because the zookeepers are so good at their jobs the birds choose to stay there in the bird park.

Excellent place to bring kids for a day trip or just to get out as a couple.

It was a great day."
,,Must see for the kids,5.0,,We reached by the local transport and had a great time with the kids. The only problem was the rains for which we were not prepared. One can go in the tram and get down at the area of interest
,,Jurong Bird Park Singapore: Where Visitors Interact withBirds,4.0,,Wonderful for the Bird Lovers. Spend at least half a day visiting different birds at the Park. You are allowed to enter the bird area to interact with the birds! The Crowned pigeons mind if you pass unnoticed them. The flamingo lake host a large number of such birds to welcome us. Buses ply from nearest MRT station of Boon Lay.
,,So natural and good air to breath,4.0,,"What I like: it is very natural to be here. You can enjoy every step by taking a deep fresh breath. What I dislike: after some hours walking, I feel tired and cannot get any foot massage therapist near with the place"
,,Lovely day out,5.0,,I didn't want to go to this place I'm not a bird lover. But my husband wanted to go. Glad I did Seeing all these colourful birds it was a great day out.
,,Very good bird park,4.0,,"It is nice park for family to spend time together ...they have many fun areas for kids and small water park for kids too. Souvenir shop is lovely ...many spiecies of birds ....can stay very close to birds , taking photos and feeding"

,,swooped by a wedge tailed eagle,5.0,,what can you say about the jurong it was the best tour that i have ever booked i went to buffalo tours booked it and when i went to the bird park i spent all day marvelling at the way they breed endangered species it was without a doubt a must do for evertone who visits singapore
,,jurong birds park,5.0,,"we never seen all these birds in our life at before , birds show is excellent , maccow and parrots and all types of birds are attracted very well"
,,The timeless elegance of a bird park,5.0,,"This bird park ticks all the boxes. We've visited a few times and even now it doesnt fail to please. Well worth the trip especially with children but even for adults like us, it was a relaxing bird watching experience."
,,Closest to birds!,5.0,,"Where can you see birds singing or teaching 123... ? Jurong bird park! Well maintained and lively! Don't miss their shows!!!! Park and officials, keep it up! Anish"
,,Even on a rainy day it was great,5.0,,We arrived at the bird park and it was raining. We brought rain gear so we just kept going. The tram around the park was very helpful and I would recommend it to get an overview. It's a big park to walk. The birds are easy to find and there is information about them in their habitats. The bird show was so much fun. Really nice displays and just fascinating areas. We took the metro and a bus to get to the bird park and it worked well.
,,Fun and Edutainment for kids,4.0,,"The location is a bit far from town, make sure to came early in the morning and back aroud 4pm. The park and its animals are clean and well maintained condition. There is a water theme park too inside."
,,Lovely surroundings,4.0,,"The bird park is very clean and beautifully maintained. It is quite hilly, so we found the easiest way around the park was to take the shuttle from the main entrance and get off at the top of the hill and walk down because it was easier to go down than up in the hot weather. Take water with you as you walk around because it is very humid. It is easy to get to via the MRT and bus service."
,,worth a visit,5.0,,we visited on our day we checked out of our hotel. Our flight wasn't until 8:30 pm so needed to fill our day after hotel check out. We paid for the train that goes around the park and jumped out at each of the stops to explore then reboard another train. Only negative is how expensive the food is
,,OKAY,3.0,,"Its okay if you are a bird watcher. Only one food place and the prices seemed high for snacks, sandwiches and pizza etc."
,,Watch amazing birds all in one place!,4.0,,"Jurong bird park is situated a little away from the main city. It can be reached by taking a train and then changing to a bus.

This place has many many species of birds to see. Most of the birds that I must have seen in books or seen on tv, were all here preset to see live. The areas of the park are divided and birds are classified and put in each area. The park is very well maintained and information is very clearly mentioned everywhere.

The most important part of the park are the bird shows. One must make sure they witness each and every show. Also do not miss the feeding part of some birds and also getting photos with some birds. Jurong waterfall located in the park is also amazing.

Words truly can't expressing the feeling of seeing so many birds and experiencing something as beautiful as this. This park needs 5-6 hours to see properly."
,,You will love the birds,5.0,,They have the best of birds in there. Very good for families. Its the largest bird sanctuaries in the world. Its a treat for the children.
,,Second Time is Just as Good,5.0,,We last visited the bird park 5 years ago. This second trip did not disappoint and we really enjoy the large aviaries and open areas for the birds which is much better than in small cages. Staff are great as well as the various shows throughout the day.
,,Underrated attraction - don't miss the high flyers show,5.0,,"Out of the way and hard to get to but one not to be missed. The park is large with a huge selection of birds, while the shows are definitely not to be missed, especially the high fliers show"
,,Birds up & close,5.0,,"Words can't explain the beauty and joy of visit to this place. The vibrantly colorful macaws in the beginning are so beautiful welcome that one cannot take eyes off them. For a fee, one can have them placed on shoulders/ arms and get clicked with them.The Haws and kite show, as well as the parrot shows were excellent. The best was being able to feed the birds. The Jurong waterfall located within the park was also very nice. Instead of the three hours we had planned, we spent almost 5 hours in the park."
,,Asia largest aviaries,4.0,,Enjoy Asia largest aviaries. Feed the birds with honey and you will see it flying towards you. There is no other places where you can find birds and parrots obeying your instructions and even singing to you.
,,Short cuts,4.0,,"The trick in Singapore is to save time.
Take a taxi from your hotel..it's about $15.
Entry was $33.
Two tricks now. Take a private tour in a golf cart type vehicle for about $30 and 2 hours
This will save you time and walking
However,there are limited numbers for this so option 2 is to take the get on/off train ride for $5 which will give you a general overview in about an hour
There are also special shows to see if you are interested."
,,Huge bird park,3.0,,"I will advise you to put on cotton tops and shorts, wear a pair of comfortable shoes or sports shoes, be there in the morning, so you can walk around with cool breeze weather (because of many tress - greenery). Not to worries, there are quite a number of huts / shelters in between to rest.
Good for family, kids and couples too.
Check it out the website, sometimes they have promotions (eg: bird park + zoo, bird park + night safari)...etc"
,,One of the largest Collection of Bird Species at one location,5.0,,"The Park has some of the largest exhibits anywhere in the world on display. In addition the Bird shows give you a AWW!!! Experince , something that should not be missed. Spend a day here and later in the evening head to the \ Night safari."

My kids grow up visiting the JBP at least 4-5 time annually in their growing up years and looks forward to every visit enthusiastically! They can name each species and recognise the park so well and takes delight in the playgrounds as well. Very good place for family weekend bonding and relaxing!
,,Well maintained animal resort,4.0,,"If there is a place to understand how well precious animals are taken CARE, one need to visit this park.the entire safari gives a sense that these animals are part of one's life. No need to add that park provides all kinds of amenities for tourists comforts."
,,"""BiRds hOme """,4.0,,"this is one wonderful creation . U wud come across so many colors . U havent imagined an all on these natural created beauties . These birds r amazing , trained so well and must say their home makers have done a fantastic job .

Clcked as many as u cud but u know what forget the cameras for once n just observe how beautiful these are ."
,,one of the best bird parks visited,5.0,,"Having seen the KL bird park a few years ago, that was the benchmark. This far exceeded expectations. It is much larger. Has a muchh large nuber of species. Though they have cut down from 1200 species to about 600. The enclosures were much roomier. You got to see the birds closer. The Haws and kite show, as well as the parrot shows were excellent. The best was being able to feed the birds. The Jurong waterfall located within the park was also very nice.
Instead of the two hours we had planned, we spent almost 5 hours in the park."
,,See Birds up and close,5.0,,"No words can explain the beauty and joy of visit to this place. The vibrantly colourful Parrots in the beginning are so beautiful welcome that one cannot take eyes off them. For a fee, one can have them placed on shoulders/ arms and get clicked with them. You need almost the whole day to see all the bird shows and galleries in there."
,,Bird Park,5.0,,Excellent exhibits. Lovely grounds with fabulous exhibits. Definitely worth a visit. We took lunch and ate it while watching the flamingos.
,,Mesmerized,5.0,,"This is one of the places that is not to be missed in Singapore. Such a beautifully managed park which hosts lot of birds. The people there work with passion and you will not, for one second, feel bored. The infrastructure, the shows and schedules, food, transport within the park is all excellent."

,,Our third trip - great place!,4.0,,"For Singapore's 50th, you can get a special deal with a residence card, one admission price gets you a year membership. We all signed up. Fun place for the kids and a tranquil walk for mom and dad."
,,Nice Place,4.0,,Good place to visit but not worth spending more than 3-4 hours... Plan accordingly....Also time ur visit according to d shows that they show....
,,Nature at its best,5.0,,I love this bird park. it was so nice. I did feed many birds myself. That concept was great. The ZOO is kept very clean and maintained well. 10/10 was the trip. Thank you for letting us have a great experience.
,,Fun Place,4.0,,Great place to spend several hours seeing all the various bird exhibits and shows. Be sure to allot a few hours of your time if you really want to see the best of what this Park has to offer.
,,Even Better than the Zoo!,5.0,,The experience was lovely and 2-3 hours would be good enough the see the whole place. A definite must see
,,"Must visit, kids enjoy the most !",4.0,,"Excellent place to be - kids enjoy the most. They have an excellent collection of birds from round the globe. One of the best parts is the enclosure wherein you could enter and see a variety of birds closely.

The bird shows are a must see especially the talking and flying-by breeds...."
,,Amazing & colorfull Atmosphere,4.0,,"1. Very adventurous place. Many rare species are there.
2. There are free trams. So if you feel exhausted you can take a tram and explore the place
3. I enjoyed the Bird Shows. It's great.
4. But I don't like the feeding Shows at all."
,,A lovely place to spend the day,5.0,,"A must see when in Singapore, there are many different types of species of bird & lots of bird shows to watch. There are different areas where birds are found in almost their original habitat Fabulous place."
,,Mesmerized,4.0,,"It was good experience to visit the Jurong Bird Park. Multi colored birds and the bird show is the attraction of the place.
Bird Show in particular is amazing and captures your attention in an un-imaginable way. I would recommend to give this place a visit if going to Singapore."
,,A visit to this amazing bird sanctuary is guaranteed to sweep you off your feet,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park has almost every species of bird, along with a lot of fun exhibits and interactive shows. I heard that park is Asia’s largest, with a collection of over 5,000 birds from 400 species.

The Waterfall Aviary, one of the world’s largest walk-in aviaries, home to more than 600 birds and a 30-metre-high waterfall.

There are other star attractions at this sprawling park, including the world’s largest walk-in lory flight aviary at over nine stories high, where you’ll get close to 15 colourful lory species, and the impressive Penguin Coast where you’ll find many species of these flightless birds.

There is also Flamingo Lake with hundreds of these strutting birds, and nearby Pelican Cove, with the world’s most complete collection of pelicans.

Kids will especially love Birdz of Play, the bird-themed water playground, for a soaking good time under the giant tipping bucket, zipping across the Flying Fox and even arcade games.

A visit to this amazing bird sanctuary is guaranteed to sweep you off your feet."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Everyone must visit it once different type of birds and show is amazing everyone would like it, special attraction would be eagle show."
,,Colourful tranquility on a Sunday morning,4.0,,It's worth making the effort to get to the Bird Park early before it gets too hot or crowded (it opens at 8.30am). We spent a lovely two and a half hours enjoying the array of colourful birds and in particular enjoyed the Birds of Paradise; the Lory Loft; and the Waterfall Aviary. The penguin pool is also a must. If you are resident in Singapore it's surely worth signing up for the annual pass which costs exactly the same as a single entry.
,,Feathery fun,5.0,,"So many birds and so much fun. The shows were amazing. I was astounded at what birds can be trained to do. I've worked with people who were less talented than some of these parrots.

Spend the whole day there so you can take it all in.

I've been twice and I'll surely return."
,,Best bird park in Asia,5.0,,"The park is a paradise for bird lovers. Plenty of opportunities for getting up close with a variety of different bird species. The park is clean and well designed. The enclosures have plenty of room. All the birds seemed happy. The shows are high quality and excellent. The best part was seeing the baby birds in incubators. It was amazing. Being a bird lover, I was so happy to see that all the birds were very well looked after."
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,The place is very beautiful with lots of different bird species. Must visit if you have kids. Weather was awesome with drizzle of rain here and there. Park is well maintained and shows planned were excellent
,,Not for small kids,3.0,,"It's a huge bird park with a wide range of species but kids will get bored very easily. Photo session with the birds and feeding them are the only two attractions for the young ones.
However there is a buggy service for those who don't wish to walk that much. Ideal for nature lovers."
,,Jurong Bird Park - Gateway to Nature,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park Singapore, one of the kinds in the world. It is known to be Asia’s largest birds’ park housed with more than 5,000 birds. I was truly enjoyed close encounters with these birds during daily feeding sessions. I’m totally bowed with the Penguin Coast expedition. The unique construction of underwater viewing gallery will flourish you the opportunity to observe how pelicans dip and dive for fish.

My visit to Breeding & Research Centre allows me to understand into how Management took seriously on managing the endangered birds and eggs and chicks.

You will regret if you miss the birds and eagle show. Your will briefed by the staff at the entry point which will be beneficial during your tour.

Overall, it’s my enjoyable journey to nature."
,,Very different,4.0,,This place is very different and beautiful one must visit this park if you are in Singapore. So many different kind of birds
,,Not as Good as before,2.0,,Years ago it was wonderful. Today it is nowhere near as good as before. Progress is not always for the best The train ride extra cost is not worth the money v
,,A good place for family trip,4.0,,Bird paradise..!! Naturally beautiful..!! Chillax... Good show to keep in touch with the audience... Impressing!!! Thumb up..
,,Just amazing!,5.0,,"This place is just exhaustive in the species of birds one can ever see in life. Although it entails a lot of walking around which might see you thirsty, it is all worth it in the end. Do not miss the bird show and the eagle show while you're there. You will be given a guide at the entrance which will help you with any and everything. One can also go in for packages that give you a combination of Jurong, Singapore Zoo and Night Safari; you might end up getting tied on time but if you have a few days in hand, such packages are worth going for."
,,Bird's paradise.,5.0,,Great place to see so many birds in one place.Nicely organised.The toy train ride is amazing.One should take photos with birds for a lifetime memory.
,,worth your time!,5.0,,"This place is good for people of all age, the bird shows are truly entertaining and informative. I would recommend this place to all people who are visiting Singapore. Make sure you start early so that you don't miss out on the shows as they have specific timings."
,,"Kids day out with Pelicans, Parrots, Flamingos.....",5.0,,"Fantastic place to visit with kids... Park opens at 8:30 AM so it's better to reach around the time as its cooler during the first half of the day..must see the High Flyers show at 11am at Pools Amphitheatre...kids will love it...the Flamingos, Beautiful Parrots, Pelicans, talking birds...etc....Check out the birds feeding schedule and other shows at park entrance. Do Carry the park map with you..Use Park Tram to reach Tram Stations located at short intervals to see various parts of the park easily....there is a beautiful small water park in the bird park premises for kids to enjoy by the end of the day.....so do carry necessary costumes...no extra charges for water park entry...keep sufficient time for the same as park closes at 5pm. Must see attraction in Singapore when travelling with kids.."
,,Unique Place,4.0,,"This is a nice place to visit with friends & families. One can easily spend one day over here. However, one would require at least half day to cover entire park. Birds from all over the world are available to see here. Park is maintained very nicely. Staff is courteous & polite. There are different live small shows of 20 minute time are available, at various times during the day. One should enquire about these shows with staff over there, after you buy the tickets. This will help you to plan your trip inside the park. One can buy 4 in 1 ticket which can cover three attractions in zoo & juror park, to save money. However, please note that juror bird park & zoo are not located in same place. You need to have separate day to cover zoo area."
,,A real delight,4.0,,"Each time I visit Singapore I include the Jurong Bird Park. The covered aviary is a sight to behold, not only because of the birds in a natural environment but because of the wonderful tropical forest environment that has been created within it and the amazing waterfall. My only sadness comes from the size of the areas in which the hornbills and large birds of prey are housed."
,,Enjoyable Experience,4.0,,"It's a park full of colorful birds! (duh) Most of the variety I saw are from tropics - which shouldn't be a big surprise. I especially liked the bird shows, so make sure you check the show timings after you buy your tickets (you can also check online and plan ahead).
The cage where you enter in and the birds fly around you freely is also another nice memory to remember. Overall an enjoyable experience."
,,Was a bit of a dissapointment,3.0,,"We loved the Show with the birds all coming in for different shows,,but we went on the trip around the park and only got so far up and turned back as the smell from the averies was really pungent, we felt ill smelling the smell of what smelt like a bait bag had been left out in the hot sun for a day or two,,not good on the sense of smelling..which was a shame as the birds were beautiful,,just the avary's had this smell and there was no foliage in their aviary's which I felt didn't make the avary look nice,,,but do go and watch the Flying show,,the birds are great,,,"
,,Only if you like birds!,3.0,,"I thought I should do the whole Singapore tourist experience. Although it was a pleasant walk around and the vegetarian food at the cafe was good it was not an experience I would be enjoying again. That said, it is an experience that others might appreciate as there are many exotic birds to view."
,,Bird Paradise,5.0,,"Superb. Just don't miss this park. There are beautiful flamingoes. The Caribbean flamingoes are brilliant pink while the Lesser Flamingo is less showy. There are Penguins , crested Pigeons, Lories, parrots, toucans , ostriches , emus cassowaries . Just tons of stuff for kids to do. Take some swimwear to play in the rain park. There is a big bucket of water to douse the kids. They can enjoy seeing different eggs, weaning of birds etc. they can feed birds too. Use the tram to hop on and off around the park. There are lot of eateries. There is nothing much for a vegetarian, so better take a packed lunch."
,,Wonderful,4.0,,Very nice and interesting. One should not miss the bird shows . And the variety of birds you see is simply amazing
,,"Birds, Birds n Birds!",4.0,,Liked n nzoyed each n everything here! They have some rare birds' collection from Africas n Americas! A must visit place for animals lovers!
,,been several times,5.0,,improved since last trip. Good for families with so many types of birds. Good for older and young children
,,Bird Paradise,5.0,,"I love birds. And if I win the lotto and have lots of money, I would buy a lot of these feathered creatures and raise them on a bird paradise of a place. And if I had an inspiration for bird paradise, Jurong bird park is it. Amazing design that is an intense habitat for birds of all kinds. Be sure you visit if you love birds. Am sure you would leave very happy"
,,Excellent entertainment,4.0,,Wonderful place with a rare collection of birds. Dont miss the shows and the Lori Loft. Kids will enjoy a lot. Deals available online. Easy to access from the city as well
,,"Superb, superb, superb....",5.0,,"This is heaven on earth. Lovely birds, beautiful place, well maintained. This is one the best place to be in and should be in. We just loved this place with so much of beautiful and colorful birds. Must must must must must be there and watch the beauty."
,,Day visit to Jurong Bird park,3.0,,"A long way out from the city centre and quite expensive (no seniors concession for tourists). Can be very busy with tour groups and school groups. Looks tired and in need of a refresh. Difficult to see the birds in some enclosures. Electric tram/bus only has three stopping points, each far apart, and if you are older and not used to the heat and humidity, this makes it more difficult to walk among the central, more open areas.
Staff very pleasant and knowledgeable. Plan the visit to ensure you catch all the timed attractions."
,,include in your itinery,4.0,,"if you visit with children a must see,even otherwise you will enjoy,Boonlay is the nearest mrt station,from there by bus numbers 55 and 335,if you by a combined ticket for night safari,you can save some dollars,a shuttle bus service to night safaris is available,there is tram service to go around.houses lots of different varieties of birds,at regular intervals shows are conducted,eateries are there and photos with birds.if you are visiting singapore don't miss"
,,Bird Paradise,4.0,,"the park is clean, with plenty of bird collection from around the world. to reach the park from the nearest MRT station, you have to take the bus"
,,Top 10 Places to Visit in Singapore,5.0,,"It is a bird watchers paradise. It is clean. It is suitable for all ages. Love the African Waterfall Aviary and Lory Loft.

If you don't like to queue too long, avoid weekend or public holiday (or come before 10 a.m. It opens at 8.30 a.m)"
,,didn't like the place,2.0,,"Some of the large birds are in cages too small, they wouldn't even get the change to have their wings spanned.
there are plenty of birds and several shows a day.
there is a water park here for kids to play in so take swimmers and towels for the kids
but try leaving, we waited at the long taxi queue for ages. I went to the service desk and asked they ring several taxi companies to get at least 20 taxi's sent out.
even taxi's dropping off people wouldn't collect from the queue and just take off
when we got a taxi we asked the driver and he said drivers don't come to Jurong and that was pretty obvious from the queue."
,,Wonderful day out,5.0,,Get up close to many birds in the enclosures managed to get some great pictures. Easy to get to using metro and bus well signposted. You will enjoy your visit.
,,Great family attraction.,5.0,,"Anyone travelling with family (read kids) or is a nature or bird lover or decides to forgo retail therapy for a day needs to head to the Jurong Bird Park.A bit pricey but when you spend the bettter part of a day here you know where your money's going.You can take the tram ride around the park or walk or do both.Don't miss the Lory loft, the penguin display and the bird show at the amphitheatre.All in all a great day spent in beautiful environs.Highly recommended."
,,Great park,5.0,,It's a gorgeous park full of of all kinds of exotic and interesting birds. My favourite part was feeding the lorries - with a bit of patience you can get them to stand on your arm or shoulder :D
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"Great place to see a huge variety of birds in beautiful surroundings. Most shows were great, informative and interesting. Loved the penguin display and feeding time. Food options were not great and a bit expensive but still satisfactory."
,,Good place but overpriced,3.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a good place to visit.
Many different species of birds can be seen over here.
Even you can see penguins over here.

Tram service is very bad compared to Night safari.
The tram driver just takes you around the road not even giving time for people to view the birds around.

Bird shows are awesome.
I loved it."
,,A must for birdlovers,5.0,,Beautiful park with many different kind of birds. Big cages which you can enter and walk around while the birds are flying over your head. The park is beautiful to walk in and you will be surprised of what you see.
,,Great park,5.0,,"beautiful rainforest bird park with an enormous number of species, very peaceful. People of any age would enjoy this park, not just kids. You can spend a relaxing day here. It was a very exciting experience"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Fantastic place to be with family.
Plan to spend atleast half a day here.
We first took a tram around the park and picked our spots which we then visited by walk.
For those with kids, make sure you rent a stroller - you may need it considering the steep inclines at some places in the park.
The special birds show in the Amphitheater is not to be missed.
Get your own cool drinks or food - the snacks inside are pretty expensive."
,,Overrated... one time watch only.,2.0,,"Too overrated for tourists, a good place overall to visit but only if you are a nature lover. Not for people who like to roam around city and shop and dine.

The Bird feeding was exciting, the rest of it was OK...not great! The price is not cheap especially if you are visiting in a group/family."
,,Always a pleasure to visit this place,5.0,,"The birds here are so adorable, 3 cheers to the trainers...the way the park is maintained is commendable. I advise everyone to do a prior booking as you save out on some dollars and queue time too..although I didn't face any long queue here atleast like the night safari..
A lot of snacking options too available. kids can be taken on strollers/prams so its convenient. the tram ride too is an easy option to roam inside the park.Flamingos and Pelican can be seen in plenty and they are so clean!! its really quite surprising. Dont miss out on the shows..the weather is the only sad part here, so carry plenty of water along but incase you don't then there are a lot of water stations throughout the park.
All in all a good experience and a must go!"
,,Frustrating day.,2.0,,"We had been told by friends that the Jurong Bird Park was an excellent place to visit so we were looking forward to it. Maybe we have been spoiled by the Singapore Zoo and we also had my sister there who is from St. Louis with another excellent Zoo but although the variety is great and you could spend a lot of time there we found our time frustrating. Why?

First it is not easy to get to or leave. It is quite far from any MRT/train station so you need to take the taxi if you are older and can't walk as far as you used to. Then when your ready to leave you either stand for an hour to get a taxi or call you. If you live in Singapore then great you have a phone but I saw some folks with small children begging to borrow a phone to call a taxi which they finally got help from someone.

Second the phamplets and signs at the park are a joke and confusing. We wanted to see the Flamingo feeding so we waited at the Flamingo lake and nothing happened then looked closer and it said Flamingo pool which was another place.

Third the cages of many of the birds were so dark and dense mesh it was hard to see the birds or get good pictures.

There were highlights of couse and i am sure the shows were good but we missed to timing. The Lorry section was great.

All in all a disappointing day. I hear they are going to combine the Bird park with the Zoo and I think that will really up the attraction. So I would suggest visitng other attractions in Singapore if you have limited time. That is unless you are an avid bird watcher."
,,Beautiful place with beautiful birds,5.0,,"Keep your cameras ready at every moment. There are birds every where and not only in their enclosures. The park is well maintained and the staff is helpful. Also as I mentioned for the zoo, the bird Park also has a small water park for children and so please carry spare cloths for them and yourself if you would be accompanying them. Also there are trams that will take you from one point to the other. There are shows here with trained birds. The best one is high flyer. Do not miss this show. The park map and show schedule is available on their website"
,,2-hrs well spent!,4.0,,"We bought the 3-in-1 parkhopper and the visit was kind of cramped! took a tram ride inside to identify the spots to visit, and was able to do it in 2 hrs with a 4 yr old! Must visit, the Flamingos, Lory Park, where you get to feed the Colorful Lory without assistance, as it they are trained to eat from whoever serves! Kids will love and cherish the experience!"
,,Worth the Visit!,4.0,,"Didnt think this would be worth the time, because i am not the biggest fan of birds. This was honestly a lovely place to visit with many species of animals and different shows to entertain. Enjpoyed it more than the zoo."
,,Must do attraction,5.0,,If you adore birds with lovely colors so don't heistate to visit the area . You can go there by Metro than take a bus . Take with you a lot of water as it is hot sometimes . You will enjoy a lovely collections from different birds
,,High Flying with the birds,4.0,,"I enjoyed my second visit to Jurong Bird Park, we sat through the High Flyers show and even participated and loved every moment of it."
,,Bird lovers paradise,5.0,,loved this place. All birds open flying around inside the huge net Like structure. the variety of species is wide. Spend couple of hours worth it.
,,Great bird park within a beautiful setting,5.0,,"My husband and I had a fantastic day at the Jurong Bird Park viewing their many varieties of birds from many countries. I loved walking around and in various avaries. While not tame a number of birds will come close and provide great photo opportunities. My husband had parrots on his shoulder while walking on two occasions. The ""tallest waterfall in the world inside an aviary"" enclosure was both massive and spectacular with the setting and the range of birds enclosed. The park has a few shows each day highlighting their birds. In our five hours today at the park we managed to just about view all exhibits, but we missed all shows except one. The show we did see was enjoyable, very modern and professionally presented. There is a ""tram"" onsite which was handy as there is a hilly section (tram $5 unless included in a parks' package). We used the MRT and public bus connection recommended on the park's brochure, the cost was very reasonable at about $2 each in total one way (bus route 194 runs express from the MRT Station interchange direct to the park). The park must have a rejuvenation program as most areas are very clean and modern looking. I loved the number of seat / park benches available across the park. I particularly enjoyed the Australian section, the various parrots, penguins and ""darkened"" owl enclosure."
,,High One!!,5.0,,"I enjoyed each and every moment in this park. It has species from all continents, across all categories of birds. You have a species in mind which you have never seen, and if it still exists...then chances are this place has it.
The layout of the park is like a circle, so you cover all the attractions in a systematic manner. There are also regular bird shows from time-to-time which are very interesting.
The staff is young and energetic along with being very supportive."
,,Rainforest experience,5.0,,Please don't go by the name as just a bird park as it's a massive park with huge collection of other animals as well. Been here twice and noticed during recent visit maintenance and upkeep had gone down. Otherwise amazing place with so many sections. Their wings of sky bird show is excellent and one of the best. Internal tram also gives a great view of the park and should not be missed. Their penguin section is outstanding and one of the best maintained. Should be high above on ur to do list when in Singapore.
,,the rain forest,5.0,,"We visited the park under pouring rain.We bought ponchos at the entrance ($4). It was an incredible experience, we really enjoyed it, we had the impression to be walking in the rain forest."
,,must visit,5.0,,been there twice. amazing place. the diverse variety of birds is a treat to the eyes. a traveller is never bored as there are lots of different bird show to watch. must visit for children. lots of in house eateries.
,,Bravo,5.0,,There are a lot of species in the park. I espacially like the paradise birds in the garden as i have never see it before (only watch in the National Geographic Channel).
,,Great value for money,5.0,,"This was my second visit to this bird park and I was not disappointed. There is so much variety and so much going on, you can get up close to some of the birds who feed from your hand. There are few shows where the birds perform but not humiliated, all quite natural. If you are a foreign visitor and travel with Singapore airlines you get a discount."
,,All together a beautiful world of birds,5.0,,"It was an amazing experience to see such beautiful and colorful birds, parrots, watching their shows and feeding them. When they come and sit on you shoulder and plays with hair, that's an awesome experience. Bird show was the best part of the visit..."
,,Nice..,4.0,,"Liked Nice collection of birds Good shows, eagle and high fliers Disliked Limited directions Limited eating options"
,,nice place to visit,4.0,,"this saw my third visit to this place..i was there only because my kids wanted to come....we had a great time at the lory loft, with the parrots.
we feeded them....and some of them were all over my body aswell on my head....
lots of birds...all around but had to walk a lot,as it was quite humid the day we visited the park...we were drenched...."
,,Lovely sight,5.0,,Birds and all types of birds is what you will get to see here...do not miss 2 bird shows which are breath taking ...lovely bird park.
,,Great visit - especially for younger kids,5.0,,"The bird park is definitely one of my favourite places in Singapore. Whilst not exactly huge, the park is well designed and well curated. The birds appear to be healthy and well taken care of.

There is ample space in this park, which, added to the myriad of colourful birds in great settings, makes it an ideal park to bring younger kids to for a nice day out."
,,Awesome Experience,5.0,,"This place is a must visit if you are a nature lover and are fond of birds, coz you would be able to not only see them but feed them also. The birds are perched so close to you that you can actually touch them. We had one bird which perched itself on my hand as if it was tree branch and took its feed from close quarters. It was an experience worth remembering and to top it the live show of predator birds vultures, kites etc., was amazing."
,,Birds of a Feather,5.0,,One of the more interesting places I've been to. With shows and exhibits that keep one's interest all the way thru the park. On a nice day you can walk miles and not even realize how far you've gone......beware of the Singapore afternoon thunderstorms!!
,,One of its kind,5.0,,JBP is lovely as I personally love birds. Its a nicely made and park with all kinds of birds. The collection is beautiful. I would recommend to buy the picture clicked at the entrance for memories. The birds of the sky show is spectacular.The nearest MRT is Boon lay and then the bus interchange from the terminal.
,,awesome collection of birds,5.0,,Damn beautiful n well organised bird park. Hundreds of varieties are birds are here from all over the world. kids and childrens will definatly like it. Worth visit
,,Bird Park,5.0,,"A heaven for bird lovers, varieties of species are there. many bird shows are there and you can take photo with them. Trams are are available if you need to cover the entire bird park in short time."
,,excellent bird park,5.0,,"The tain transport is essential as park is quite hilly Book for the luch with the birds, great value"
,,great place to bring the kids! and bird lovers must visit,4.0,,If you've got the time to travel to the west of Singapore this is a great place to bring the kids and bird lovers as they'll really enjoy the experience out here... I enjoyed it thoroughly but I find after I leave the west doesn't allow me easy access to restaurants and other places but if you have the time it is worth a visit!
,,Wonderful Bird Park,5.0,,This was my first experience at a Bird Park and it was well worth the visit. It was clean and all the animals looked very healthy and well cared for. Although there were quite a few cages there were also a lot of open spaces with birds. The pelican exhibit was especially impressive. I would recommend stopping here if you visit Singapore. Try to go in the early morning as the heat is always an issue.
,,JBP,4.0,,"Who interest in the research of birds and nature cna go and visit this place. We could see penguin and Eagle , Owl we can see there"
,,A must go in Singapore.,5.0,,a really great place. loved each and every moment there. loved feeding the birds. nice relaxation. n not to forget the bird shows really exiting. a great collection of birds.
,,Experience of a lifetime,5.0,,"A very well maintained tourist attraction, one can simply marvel at the way each activity has been researched and conducted.

Start early and make sure you collect the day's activity guide at the entrance. The flagship shows start in the morning with a frequency of twice a day. So planning your schedule is of utmost importance.

The kids loved the sight of the birds flying right above.

Worth a second visit after a couple of years !"
,,A 'natural' paradise of Birds,5.0,,"An un-paralleled travel destination - a fully man made 'natural' habitat for 3 to 4000 birds of variety of species. The tour to the park takes away all stress and strain, specially with kids.

To do any small justice to aid one's memory of visiting the park, you should carry a high-capacity memory card with a fast camera - to capture as many birds as you can. The High-flyer's show is a must see. The number spellings by 'Amigos' shall remain in the memory for long among all other stunts by the birds - just fabulous. Pelican show is also a must see.

The free tram ride shall help is resting the legs a bit. The major part of the attractions are in the first part of the park, compared to the 2nd half. So, be ready to travel slightly to-n-fro to capture the maximum. Bird feeding and birds on your head and shoulder is an enthralling experience.

It's a MUST see."
,,First visit to Singapore,4.0,,"Jurong bird Park grt for first timers to a exclusive bird Park. Tip would be to take your night safari ticket also here itself as it will save you cost as well as time
Grt exhibits esp. Parakeets, penguins and the various native species
One grt big grey coloured bird stood motionless was grt to watch
And the flock of red flamingos is a sight to watch...
Preferably Pls go early mrng as some shows like the parakeet etc. Are held at specific timings. Some other shows are during evng 5 pm
Lovely place to visit includes even a small artificial waterfall to take some grt selfies
All in all grt place to go and spend arnd 3-4 hrs"
,,spoilt by the weather,3.0,,An excellent venue that should allow a bit more for when it rains as it does in Singapore quite a lot.
,,Best place for bird lovers,4.0,,"This park has a vast variety of birds to show. They have great bird shows, which are very educational also for the kids. The experience was too good."
,,Colours galore!,4.0,,"What a great place! I don't particularly like to see birds or animals in cages but this wasn't to bad. They have fantastic variety of birdlife, and the High Flyer show was fun. If you have little patience for crowds or pushy people who have no consideration for fellow tourists this can be a bit annoying. The information about birds is fantastic, they have an area where they breed endangered species, and the map is easy to follow, or you can take a shuttle around the park which is hop on hop off I think. If you have young kids they may get bored after the show's as it's mostly looking in cages and reading information.

Getting there is easy as there are numerous options, MRT, Taxi, hop on hop off bus from the city. We took the MRT and it was easy, it took us about 40min from Promonade to Jurang then a short bus ride to the bird park. The MRT is very easy to get around on."
,,Good,4.0,,"Worth it if you have extra day in S'pore. Buy buggy ticket if you have small children, they have few stop, you could stop at any of it, walk around and take the next buggy to other location."
,,Family kids 8 & 11yrs,4.0,,"I was expecting to rate this an excellent but compared to the Bali Bird Park it didn't quite tick all the boxes for us. We had a very enjoyable day and the surrounds and gardens are beautiful. There are a few must see/do attractions such as feeding the Lorikeets at the Lory Loft and the feeding session at the Waterfall Avairy, the breeding centre and the kids loved the Birds of Play water park a great idea in these hot climates. As a family we love birds and have a few as pets at home, but most people will find the rest of the enclosures a bit boring. They really need more walk through aviaries as looking at birds through mesh wire does not make for good viewing or photos. There was a tram that stops at all the major attractions and for the first time ever I would recommend most people do this if they are not a bird fanatic as the distance between enclosure is a bit too spread out for such a warm climate. We only saw one show the High Flyers Show and compared to many other bird/animal shows we have seen it was not that exciting. Maybe they should do some research and view some other shows such as the ones at the Bali bird park and the Australia Zoo. My suggestion would be get there when the gates open at 8.30 check out penguin coast then catch tram from stop 1 to Lory Station and feed the Lorikeets, then catch tram to Waterfall station for the 10.30 feeding after that catch the tram back to main station, if you really want to watch the show the High Flyers is at 11am then make the walk back up to the Birds of Play waterpark taking in the other sights including the breeding centre along the way. Hope this helps you enjoy you day at this beautiful park. The only way to get real value from the zoos is to purchase a 4 park hopper pass valid for 7 days."
,,Beautiful collection of local birds,5.0,,A great collection of colorful local birds. Good write ups on the different species. A very enjoyable morning.
,,Huge Variety and Larger than I Expected,5.0,,"This park has a huge variety of birds in a well sized park. Can get a discount on tickets by buying them online ahead of time and/or combining them with the zoo, night safari or river safari. If you're staying in the centre it may be slightly out the way but worth it if nearby."
,,Jurong bird park.,5.0,,Beautiful place to see the all diffeance birds in one place. Most of the good thing was big wet and wild playground there. So you should bring a swim suit and towel.
,,The Best Place to visit,5.0,,Jurong Bird Park is the best place to visit to catch the glimpse of varities of Birds and they have maintained it so well. Would visit next time for sure to capture the glimpse of birds
,,Interesting Place for Bird Lovers,5.0,,"The park is excellent for bird lovers as it has a large variety of birds amidst nature. The park offers a hop in hop off ride within the bird park so you can cover the entire park. The suspension bridges are fantastic and you can see a lot of colorful birds especially lories when you walk across these. You can buy feeds for the the Lories too. Please see the show timings when you enter the park, so that you do not miss the bird shows. Overall a very good experience"
,,Good variety of Birds,4.0,,"Plenty of birds to see, we are keen photographers, but found the heavy meshing on the cages hard to photograph through. The walk in cages were good as the birds fly freely. The new Waterfall feature is quite impressive"
,,entertaining and educational,5.0,,"can get close to birds many varieties of birds interesting shows, nothing to dislike about. i prefer this to santosa and the zoo"
,,Value for money,3.0,,"A bit better value than the River Safari and the Singapore Zoo. Similar problem though - its too hot for the birds and they all hide in their shelters. Tram rides are good make sure they are included in your ticket as the slopes can be exhaustive to walk in the heat.
The bird feeding show, Pelican feeding show, Parrot feeding area are the highlights. Amphitheater show is good as well. Check the timings as they are bang on time and its over in 5-10 mins."
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,very well managed wild life reserves ... animal lovers and wild life photographers a must visit place for youll
,,Good experience,4.0,,A nice place to visit. My child enjoyed it a lot. Singapore is a very child friendly state. Do not miss the bird shows and tram ride. Amazing.
,,Must do with Kids,4.0,,"This is must do activity if you are visiting Singapore with kids (plan for at least 4hrs). I visited this place in Dec 2014. It has got a good mix of nature and birds with a very well planned walk. The park offers a hop in hop off ride within the bird park so you can cover the entire parkThere are two suspension bridges which are fantastic and you see a lot of colorful birds especially lories when you walk across these. You can buy feeds and feed the Lories too.
Very important Do not miss any of the shows"
,,Best Place Ever,5.0,,"If you happen to visit Singapore, this is a sure ""No-Miss"". A very beautiful place. Specially the OAT bird Show. Incredible!"
,,Colourful Birds,4.0,,There are plenty of unique and colourful birds but unfortunately some of the cages are very small. It is a catch 22 because if the cages are made bigger then it is harder to see the birds. At least some of them get out when the bird shows are on.
,,Birds and More Birds,4.0,,"Purely as my daughter was with us, we went to this place, but it can for sure be avoided. They claim, they have the tallest, man made water fall I..e 100 feet tall. The park offers a hop in hop off ride within the complex, so you can see one zone and the. Move on to the next.. Be sure you do not get fleeced with their con game of getting your photograph clicked with birds and then they charge close to 45 SGD for the souvenir which for sure is not worth it"
,,Colourful Parrots,4.0,,"The park is very beautiful. It is the bright coloured birds that will capture your attention and leave you mesmerised.

They have lots of shows, which are all very entertaining to kids and adults alike. So, make sure you pick up the pamphlet containing show timings at the entrance.

Another interesting aspect is that one also gets a chance to click pictures with birds.

This place is far from the main city and traveling to and fro takes up your time."
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"Nice place, we have short of time, traveled in tram, not able to see the birds shows. In the end my daughter enjoyed in water play area."
,,i just love birds,5.0,,I love the bird show... It just makes me connected with nature. It was fun and a good experience. Would love to visit the zoo as well...
,,Upclose with so many birds,4.0,,"Bird park is one of the best place get close to nature & experience so many birds. The wide variety birds and the information about them provided via different informative boards is very good specially if you have kids who are going to school.
There are different shows organized as well like the high flyer show, birds of prey etc which are good for entertainment.
You get to so many birds from so close distance. The diversity in colors can be very fascinating for bird lovers. The flamingoes, the pelicans, the parrots, peacocks all beautiful birds make it really special. I liked the owl in the section reserved for bats & owls. The penguins are also my favorites. I have visited the bird park on 3-4 occasions and would visit it again in future.
Only let down in my opinion is the quality of food specially for vegetarians. Like i said in my review of zoo, for the high prices that are charged for the food in these area, the quality can be much better. A simple example is veg biryani its not just a colored rice. Someone should tell the caterers that biryani has a wonderful mix of spices which is clearly lacking in the food served at both zoo as well as bird park. My recommendation is for people to pack their own food if you are particular about some food."
,,All the colourful birds of the world here!,4.0,,"I visited this place for the 2nd time, first was in 2004. Since then there is no new addition of birds... but is a wonderful way to spend your day with your ones... you see lots of colourful birds many of them endangered species. It has got a good mix of nature and birds with a very well planned walk."
,,Great place for bird lover,4.0,,"Ina tropical paradise of Singapore this is extremely well maintained learning experience . Jurong BirdPark, with a collection of thousands of birds from more so many species"
,,one of the best,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park, is a tourist attraction in Singapore managed by Wildlife Reserves Singapore. It is a landscaped park, built on the western slope of Jurong Hill"
,,For Bird lovers,4.0,,* Lot of birds shows * Opportunity to feed the bird * Large variety of birds * Need to be prepared to walk a lot * Must visit for people with toddlers
,,Excellent Lunch time Buffet,5.0,,If you visit the park during lunchtime and if you're wondering whether to go for the buffet in the restaurant don't hesitate. just go for it and you will not be disappointed.
,,birds and more birds,4.0,,lovely place to spend ur day with kids....if u r local here. for tourists - a must visit if u love all kinds of birds. lory loft is what kids love...feeding the lorries....is a great experience.
,,Wonderful friendly birds,5.0,,A really great bird zoo with lots of walk in aviaries. The lorikeet experience and the bird shows are very good. The birds are used to people and will even sit on you at feeding time. The hornbills and birds of paradise are the highlights.
,,Delight for kids Birds,5.0,,You cant come to Singapore & not go to Jurong. My 2nd time _ Take online tickets to save queue - If you have kids then you can choose a SGD 15 trolley - You can see several birds incl Large painted storks freely flying in & out of enclosures. Fantastic collection & Do not miss any of the shows. Close to Science Centre & Snow worlds - All 3 are Must do activities
,,Heartbreaking,1.0,,I hated this. Absolutely hated it. Birds need horizontal space to fly as well as vertical. It broke my heart to see birds with huge wing spans crowded into small aviaries. I will never go again.
,,Birdies paradise!,5.0,,Upgraded and lots of fun. Many types of birds to explore! Went to this walk in with birds flying on top of you and you can just touch and feed the birds. I enjoy my whole day here with my husband. 😍
,,Excellent bird park,5.0,,"Like the Singapore Zoo, you can buy tickets as a combo and incl some other Singapore attractions if you want for a small reduction in price. Take an umbrella with you, as shelter from the sun or one of those random thunderstorms that pass by.
Huge amount of bird species to see as well as a few shows that happen at certain times of the day. Excellent free flight aviary with a big man made waterfall in there, a great place to sit and bird watch, we even saw a squirrel in there. Wheelchair access everywhere, free toilets as well.
You can also feed the small parrots for $3 (optional) in another enclosure. Great place if you are a fan of birds. Allow yourself 4-5 hours to really get the most out of this place."
,,Very nice bird park,4.0,,"If you love birds and want to see a great variety of birds this is the place to go to. The bird shows are great too especially the one with PAU PAU... There are two suspension bridges which are fun and you see a lot of colourful birds especially lories when you walk across these. You can buy feeds and feed the lories too.
The penguins are cute so are the birds of the amazon rain forest
Takes about 3-4 hrs to visit the entire park. The pink flamingoes are beautiful and you get to click pictures with lots of these graceful birds after the bird show."
,,Exotic birds- a feast to the eyes,5.0,,"The moment I entered the Jurong Bird Park, the first bird I happened to notice was a beautiful peacock with feathers completely fanned out like a full semicircle.
Ostrich, kiwi, emu,penguins,albatrosses, flamingos, storks, cranes, pelicans, pigeons, parrots, cuckoos, owls, humming birds, kingfishers, woodpeckers, broadbills , babblers are some of the birds that I could remember though there were many more varieties/species of birds found there.
There were two shows which were excellently handled by their staff and after seeing the shows, I was totally satisfied that my visit had been really worth. It is advised that visitors should reach the place well before the commencement of the show and occupy a seat somewhere in the middle row to get a chance to keep some birds in hand during the demonstration as part of the show.
Incidentally, since the visit happened in the year of celebration of Singapore's 50 years' completion, the tickets bought were made valid for the entire year. Actually, I had gone with my grandson of two and a half years and hence advised my daughter to take him to the bird park again before the end of the year to take advantage of the free entry and at the same time imbibe in his memory, the sight of various birds for all the years to come, taking the cue that children's brain work best around three years of age."
,,Not worth a visit any more,3.0,,"I have visited this park for the third time and felt that it has fallen in standards. Not worth a visit, instead the time can be spent well, doing something else."
,,Very nice Bird shows and bird park,5.0,,The Jurong Bird park boasts as being the Best in Asia. I would rate it a 5 considering that the shows are very unique; the timings are also comfortable and I bet they always have a full house. The restaurants outside the park are sad; food is not that great and quite costly. Try and make it to the Lunch with the birds event if possible. The ticket price increases if u take the buggy ride which is recommended else walking so much is very tiresome. For me the highlight was the Lory Loft wherein you can feed the Lory bird species rice and water at a minimal price of 4 SGD.
,,Must watch,4.0,,will take 4-5 hrs for Jurong bird park. V throughly enjoyed the Bird park. If u fllow the path you should be able to miss anything. It is just awesome place for kids.
,,Great show of birds,4.0,,"The Bird Park is well-maintained and the enclosures are very accessible. We never knew there were trolley buses plying across the walkways until we had already covered quite a bit. So visitors who find walking difficult should look for the trolley buses. The Bird Show was the best we have seen with a very good Presenter. She was able to get the audience going with her and the birds performed extremely well.
Great Show!!"
,,Bird Birds every where,4.0,,"The animals seem well looked after, in good surroundings. Great to see orang-utans in family groups, swinging through the trees with so much freedom & the shows which are there are worth to watch.."
,,Best Bird Park ever,5.0,,It's best bird park ever seen. It has variety of colourful birds. Has lot of options for photographers to try their hands on. It has whole lot of macaws of brilliant colours & bird shows which keeps entertainment to its best for all visitors.
,,Great day for kids,5.0,,Fantastic bird shows in outdoor arenas. Had kids talking for days about the talking parrot. Also take swimmers for great water play area for kids and parents as it is a nice way to cool down.
,,Excellent and Worthwhile Visit,5.0,,we visited the Jurong Bird Park and wished we had more time to spend there. It is a great attraction with a vast variety of different birds and plenty of opportunities to take photos and get up close to some of the residents !!
,,Too Artificial and Automated For a Bird Park,2.0,,"Primarily meant for kids and not adults, only adults can skip the same. It is very well developed, managed and maintained bird park but there is nothing much natural there. There are variety of birds from across continents but majority of them are caged. There are shows that are conducted and really well trained birds that display stunts for one to enjoy but not for someone who has seen them in their natural habitat. Birds are to be enjoyed in natural habitat where one can has to put efforts to sight them and get to learn their natural ways, that is real learning. This is more for small kids to enable them to see the birds live instead of books, if that is not the purpose can be avoided. Thumbs down to the park as per me. Our conference planner definitely made the wrong choice of the place for us to visit on the City Tour."
,,Quite old,3.0,,"The bird park is seems old but it still well maintain. The bird is also in good condition, cages are big enough and they seem happy there. The staff is also helpful. If there is breakthrough and the price down a little bit maybe there will be more visitor."
,,Bird lover's delight,4.0,,"Don't miss seeing Jurong bird Park, especially if your traveling with kids, or your a bird lover.it is a landscaped park of about 50 acres, built on Jurong Hill"
,,Beautiful bird park,4.0,,This bird park is good not only for kids but for adults too. You get to see a great variety of birds in natural environment. There a couple of hanging bridges with beautiful lorries all around you as u cross these bridges. You can also buy feeds for these birds. This adds to the fun . The bird shows are also great . Go visit this park.. Lots of beauty all around
,,Average place to go,3.0,,Not very impressive for the ticket price. Can skip it if you have already visited zoo and night safari. Singapore has much more to offer than this.
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"It was a fantastic place. Kids absolutely loved it, the best part was when the pink flamigoes came in at the end of the show. check out the video at http://youtu.be/yrNiuHLfDaM"
,,Feeding Birds,4.0,,"This is a great place to go with kids, if they like birds of course. The only things that a didn't like was the birds in cage and expensive. But i loved the opportunity to feeding birds at Lory loft, pelican cove, waterfall birds and flamingos lake. I have great photo feeding lories."
,,Hats off... I was pleasantly surprised it was great!,4.0,,"Can't say that a visit to a bird park tops my list of must sees, however this place was actually very very good. It was clean, very well kept and full of an incredible variety of winged treats. Firstly I loved the setting; it had one of the few hills in Singapore which added a nice change to the otherwise cricket pitch flatness. Secondly we went to the show at 11am which was very good. The kids loved the birds flying so close above their heads and the wide variety of small and huge birds! Third for the ornithologist amongst you the bird selection is incredible.

Right now they are doing annual membership for free with your days entrance fee and, given its just around the corner from our sons school, it's a no brainier.

Well done Bird Park. You made feathered friends cool and fun."
,,Must watch,5.0,,"This is not only good for children, but also for adults as you see variety of birds under one boundary, the bird shows are breath taking and you also have options to feed the birds - wow"
,,Beautiful Bird park,5.0,,"If u have children along with u then don miss to go the Jurong bird park. It is located well outside the city and takes an hour to reach the place from the heart of the city. The bird park consists of walk in aviary, bird shows, amphitheatre for bird shows and tram rides to see around the park in a quick way.
Once when u enter u can notice the penguin habitat and the feeding of penguins is at 10 am daily. don miss it.
There is a photo spot where u can hold the birds and photos will be taken and u can buy it if u want but the cost is high so we had an idea, we swapped cameras with another family and they took our pic when we had the birds and vice versa.

Flamingoes , finches , macauvs are the best.
They have all types of birds found all along the world. U can feed honey to the birds for 5$ and get a pic taken when birds come to feed on the honey in your hands. Do use your own camera cos the park photographers charge u more. Some exhibits like swans are very big and gives a awful stench smell. There is a big man made waterfall and dont miss it.
Opt for a tram ride if u cant spend half a day atleast in the park. There are many shows at different timings so do grab a park map to not to miss any shows. MRT is connected to jurong park but u need to walk 0.5 km from the MRT.
Overall it is a lovely experience and don miss it"
,,Great for big and little kids,4.0,,Been here once before and still enjoyed it the second time. Highlight both times for me was the aviary where you can feed the parrots.
,,Educational and fun,5.0,,"I visited it the first time in 1968 when it first opened. Even then, the colorful birds were mesmerizing for a child. It is now different visiting as an adult although the charms still exist. It has since become a large and organized park that showcases 200 species of birds. There are many attractions such as the penguin house that keeps 5 different kinds of penguin, the dark house that keeps nocturnal birds, and various shows such as bird talents show and thunderstorm and drizzles show. It is a fun and educational place for the whole family and friends. Wear a hat and drink lots of water; it is warm and humid."
,,Must go if you have children,3.0,,Your children will undoubtably love this attraction. My younger sister and my nephew really get excited as they even dont want to leave at the afternoon. Im not quite sure whether I would recommend this place to couples or group of friends as it would not be a must in Singapore :)
,,Lovely Bird Park,5.0,,"Every time we visit Singapore we must go to Jurong Bird Park we all love it especially my girls .
You must know the shows time schedule before going there not to miss any show , you can download it from the net . usually we go by MRT to the nearest station then by bus."
,,Enjoy the Birds Flypast!,5.0,,"Go by MRT towards Jurong. Alight at Jurong East or Boon Lay and take a feeder service. Stay for the Bird Shows and you will never regret your time invested here. Since this is Singapore you will find food and beverages here too. You will never go hungry or thirsty. All for a reasonable tourist affordable prices.
Enjoy the Birds Flypast!"
,,Flying grounds....,4.0,,"Almost bird breeds are available in here. In different cages and environmental conditions. This is itself a big achievement for maintain such wide breed range and birds. It is nice experience to visit and watch birds together. Regards, Vishal"
,,lovely place but some of the birds and other animals have very small enclosesures,3.0,,"i visited the park in march 2015 and was dubious. On the whole the birds and other animals seem well cared for,but i was very saddened to see the dolphins, penguins, snow owls and antarctic owls to be in such poor conditions.The room they have is not adequate and the poor snowy owls are just kept in a barren white washed room with nothing. Alot of the enclosures lack stimulation for these magnificent creatures why cant you put more in them,.....
the aquatic and other mammals had very limited space which is completely unnecessary considering the size of the park. If you want these animals to be happy and your customers please improve the conditions these animals are kept in- space is everything.
The breeding programme where you can spectate is very good and the rest of the park well layed out, it isn't the worst park by any means but always room for improvement.Worth a visit but please air your views when you are there! So they start listening."
,,Color flying,4.0,,As the name says color flies here. Amazing time watching and clicking the rare birds. Good knowledge for the kids and the shows are a must watch.
,,Interesting and comprehensive,3.0,,"We visited the Jurong Bird Park with our 1 year old daughter and mother-in-law.
We did enjoy the Jurong Bird Park, however we were unclear whether you were meant to walk around or take the tram, or both, as there wasn't a clear path to follow to cover all the enclosures.
Travelling around with a pram was rather challenging as there was a lot of walking. This would not be so bad but the humidity and heat made this a sweaty affair.
The variety of birds on show was huge, from big to tiny, colourful tropical birds to penguins (the penguin enclosure was a welcome escape from the humidity!). We particularly enjoyed the Lori Loft for feeding the birds, also the enormous Waterfall aviary was outstanding.
If you're a bird enthusiast I would encourage a visit to the Bird Park, however if your interest is only light then I would suggest one of the many other animal attractions in Singapore may be a better option."
,,beautiful place :),4.0,,"Jurong Bird park is the biggest in Asia. As we are parrot-partners, was one of the reasons we picked Singapore for our stopover.

Entrance to the Bird Park just was $25 every, or $30 including a cable car ride. With Singapore Airlines tickets we got passage for the two of us with cable car ride for $51. I wouldn't have irritated with the cable car ride on the off chance that it hadn't been for this offer. The separations in the recreation center are effortlessly walkable - however the cable car is presumably useful for kids, as the warmth can be tiring.

At the passage is a chance to be shot with parrots, yet we didn't trouble with this as you have to pay additional and we have a considerable amount of photographs of ourselves with parrots as of now. Passing Macaw Island and Flamingo Pool, chose to make for one of the stroll through aviaries as these are much greater and better than any we had been to anytime recently. The walk took us past Songbird Terrace, where you can have 'lunch with the parrots' however our involvement in the Orinoco Delta had persuaded me that mealtimes and parrots are not a decent mix.

The Waterfall Aviary is a multilevel stroll through walled in area with guinea fowl, spreo starlings, delegated pigeons and a wide range of different winged creatures which were inconceivably baffling to attempt to photo. Next, we went by the Jungle Jewels walled in area, where the conures were marginally additionally obliging about staying still. The highlight was the Lory Loft, another multilevel nook where you can purchase a pot of nourishment for $3 and the lories eat out of your hand.

Toward the evening we viewed a free flying parrot show. This was incredible and instructive. The entertainers included hornbills and toucans and additionally parrots and cockatoos. The ""traps"" the flying creatures performed were gone for showing regular practices, instead of essentially amusing a crowd of people.

After the show we took our cable car ride go down to visit the toucan and hornbill aviaries. They have had a fruitful hornbill rearing program and have discharged some into the wild, incorporating in the recreation center zone. We saw several wild hornbills going by a companion in the aviary. Additionally strolled through winged creature of heaven nook – another stroll through aviary.

Our visit completed with the 'Universe of Darkness' owl show - the main piece of the fledgling stop that didn't work too well.

On out we ceased at the Hawk Café for a beverage. In spite of the fact that we didn't eat here the nourishment alternatives looked great. By and large the cooking outlets in the recreation center were superior to those I have seen in zoos and fledgling stops in the UK.

We spent the best piece of a day here - there is a ton to see"
,,Variety of birds and animals at show,4.0,,This is more of a zoo that has some shows that are performed by the inhabitant creatures. The shows last 20 minutes or show and are entertaining. the area is well maintained and is well marked for directions!
,,Better than expected,4.0,,"Initial thoughts were that this may be a means to extract more dollars from tourists. Why not just have the birds in the normal zoo? However that all changed when we explored this gem. It is easy to get around and the special train provides a very scenic view, as does the aerial walkways. Mobility can be a problem but a quick look at your map and there are ways to access most places using wheelchair friendly access points, so a little planning is required. We chose to sit and relax over drinks watching what was going on while doing so. The displays are excellent and the shows informative and fun. We were in off season mid week but the place was busy. Coach transfers to the Zoo and Night Safari work well. It is possible to do two of the three in one day but all three in a day you would be missing too much - even if you had been to any of them before."
,,Depressing place - go to the zoo instead,2.0,,"I'm not quite sure what I imagined this would be like - but I certainly didn't think this would be as depressing as it was. In the main, a very old fashioned style of exhibiting the wildlife. Depressing cages and landscaping. I understand the Singapore Zoo is a much more uplifting experience."
,,Spent some quality fun time inside,4.0,,The park is wonderful - with a very large variety of birds and excellent greenery inside. It's well-maintained and has bird shows. It's definitely worth a visit.
,,Educational & a wonderful venue to observe bird behavior if you spend some time in aviaries,5.0,,"Once you look behind all of the kid park attractions (animal shows & hoards of oblivious adults and children) they actually have a very expansive property with huge aviaries where I witnessed nest building, mating behavior and incubation. Spent an entire day there! Their mission is to protect many endangered birds and they have an impressive captive breeding program with emphasis on educating the public on the dangers of illegal pet market. Signage for some of the taxidermic specimens could be vastly improved. Especially impressive was the bird of paradise habitate and their captive breeding program. The hornbills were especially interesting with females enclosing themselves in nest boxes. I think kids would also enjoy the park."
,,Excellent For Families,4.0,,There is a train that travels along the entire circuit that makes this place a very relaxed experience for families with small kids. You can hop on and off as you wish. Great Parrot enclosure and some huge raptors as well as flamingoes. Thoroughly enjoyable day out.
,,Nice bird park,4.0,,"It's a good bird park with a huge range of birds. I'm not a great fan of animals/birds but I also enjoyed a lot here, especially the owl as well as penguins. Good one time visit."
,,In heaven with the beautiful birds,5.0,,"This bird garden is so well organized it is hard to think that it could be better. I hear that it will be moved in two years and closer to the zoo. I guess that will be good for families, except that I spent the entire day in the Bird Park, so I don't see how people could do the zoo and the bird park in one day. Every bird was different. It was just an amazing day. So many different varieties of birds, Aviaries so that you could go in with them, and be right close. They were curious and came near by. What fun. I would definitely go again and spend just as much time."
,,Fun,4.0,,"It was a great place for a family outing
Get ready to walk a lot and sweat it is a big place
Bring snacks for the kids they only have one place to eat not too good food there
Make sure to catch the parrot show it's fun"
,,"Lots of variety of birds, well maintained park",4.0,,"Jurong bird park is great in terms of variety of the birds and shows they have. I personally don't like to see birds in park as they are caged but then kids do enjoy it and get lot of information on different endangered/ rare species. The park is well maintained, so it a nice place to spend 3-4 hrs."
,,A must visit place,5.0,,"We just loved everything about the park, the greenery, the collection of birds, their live shows and the accessibility within the park."
,,Great bird park,5.0,,Really enjoyed visit to jury get bird park. Easy to get to by underground and bus. So many birds to see make sure you are there in time to see the shows well worth it. Lovely water park for children to keep cool. Take a walk through enclosure where birds fly around you
,,Something different as most other wild life attractions are for big animals or wild beasts,4.0,,"It is usual to spot a natural or man-made parks dedicated to large animals, wild beasts or marine life. It is not unusual but rare to spot bird sanctuaries and parks. Therefore when Singapore offered one, I took the onus on me to visit it.
The park is located on the outskirts of Singapore, the nearest MRT is Boon Lay. I started from Paya Lebar MRT and it took me about 2 hours to reach this park. Once you alight at Boon Lay, you go towards bus interconnect. Sign boards will help you reach there, its interconnected with the MRT station through a mall. Bus number 194 directly goes to bird park. The bus stop where you get down at bird park will be the same bus stop from you will get the bus back to MRT. Bus frequency was about 30 minutes, and bus ride takes 15-20 minutes. As I said overall journey took about 2 hours, so if you are tough on time then try out taxi which should be affordable.
It is always good to get a ticket beforehand, however if you going on weekdays then there will not be much queue at ticket window. Changi Recommends at Changi Airport provides tickets for wild life parks at Singapore. I would suggest that if you have multiple parks in your itinerary then go for park hopper tickets. I took park hopper ticket for all 4 parks. Changi Recommends give discounted tickets, much lower than online prices.
Once you enter the park, first check the show timings and then plan your route. Best way is to take a tram and go straight to Lorry Loft. This is the place where parrots roam free and feeding is allowed for a minimal price. Parrots are very friendly, they will sit on your body if you allow them. As Singapore has tropical climate, these parrots have developed a taste of salt present in your sweat. Once a parrot sit on your head, he will give a nice massage by sapping out salt from your sweat. That's my observation, I may be wrong totally. But parrots gave me good head massage.
From Lorry Loft, you can either take again tram to next station or walk as its not that far. In this stretch you will discover Australian Ranch with Ostrich, Emu, Cassowary etc.
Further way down is Pelican Grove, check out the feeding time and be sure you are there. There are various species of Pelicans here, an audio tour at the time of feeding provide essential information about pelicans. You can purchase a bag of fish and feed the pelican. They ask for voluntary fees, I gave $5 for one bag.
Further down the lane is water aviary where a man made waterfall is located. This is located near a tram station so you can take and tram and get down to check it out. Feel of water is much refreshing and rejuvenating.
Next visit is to Flamingo pool. This place is located near the entrance on the left side when you enter inside the park. Flamingos are one of the main attractions of the park. These pink beauties have their own grace and they surely will charm you. In the High Flier show, at the end of that, flamingos are left loose and you are provided an opportunity to have photographed with these. Don't miss it.
Another attraction of the park is penguins. They do not have emperor penguins but king penguins are there. Check out the feeding time. This attraction is very near to the entrance.
Tram ride is included in the entrance ticket, however you can only take the ride once. This rule is relaxed after 2 PM, then you can take any number of rides.
Now you have an overview of what to expect, I would recommend that if you have kid or love for birds then it is a must visit. Kids will love free roaming parrots in Lorry Loft. The overall trip of this park would take around 3-4 hours."
,,lovely place,5.0,,"Favorite place to bring the kids. Great birds collection, all kept in good condition. Loved the bird shows. Loved the aviary too."
,,"Great family attraction, well organised, amazing birds, enclosures and activities",5.0,,"The park has about 5,000 different birds, some I've never seen before. There's a great enclosure to walk through with some birds eating out of your hands (great for kids). There is a small train to travel around the park that talks about all the attractions etc. It's very well organised and you could easily spend all day there walking around, eating (food is good but not cheap) and visiting all the various bird enclosures."
,,Mainly for kids but it's a great morning out,5.0,,"This is a great bird park, well organised and with interesting exhibits and birds I've never heard of let alone seen. We took a taxi out there and it's $20 from the city, cheep! Worth a visit"
,,All about the birds,5.0,,"Nothing to dislike. If you love birds, then this is a great place to spend a day. Informative, experiential, Jurong has it all!! A super day out for the family."
,,"Well maintained, high quality park, one of its kind!",5.0,,"As I said, this is one if its kind in the world..You get to see the worlds exotic birds very closely with their acts in front of a packed audience, my little one celebrated her first birthday here & the cuckkoo sang Bday song for her..was very special to us"
,,mainly for kids,3.0,,the park is mainly for kids/ bird lovers. afternoon is not a good time to visit since it gets very hot.
,,Nice place for children,5.0,,"It's largest bird park in Asia, you can see many kinds of bird that you never seen from other place. it's easy to come to this place, you can take bus and get off at the in front of this part."
,,"Pricey and far, but pleasant and not crowded",4.0,,"Visited multiple times on weekends (Sat n Sun). The location is in industrial zone of Singapore, so at least 45mins travel bus bus/mrt from city centre. However, once you are inside the park, the atmosphere is very pleasant and not like industry zone at all.

Food and drink is extremely expensive (at least twice or thrice compare to the prices outside) in the park and very limited options. You may pack your meals and drinks -- highly suggested. At Boon Lay MRT where you can connect to bus to the park, is right next to Jurong Point Shopping Centre - a sizeable mall where you can purchase food or drinks to bring to the park.

At leisurely pace, may need 2 or 3 hours in the park."
,,Wheres the Burdz,5.0,,My sister insisted on going to the bird sanctuary and we eventually spend a couple of hour there it was surprisingly wonderful and the little parrots are not shy
,,Something not to be missed in Jurong Area,4.0,,"Take a wondering and peaceful stroll in this park located at Jurong Area of Singapore. It may be located out of the place, however definitely worth a visit due to it large collection of birds and it wonderful show performed by Star Birds. Visitors can also find largest man-made waterfall in the corner of the park. Do visit before it's relocation in near future."
,,Birds Paradise,4.0,,"Little out of the way of all the attractions that Singapore has, is a good place to be with the nature & birds. The place is compact, clean, full of birds and you are greeted with riot of bird voices. There are lot of things happening here and you get overwhelmed by the grandeour.

Do not miss the highlights ie noon shows - 2 shows, one after the other in the amphitheatre and near by. You may take the tram to get a feel of the place and then walk leisurely from one set of birds to another. Beware of the heat and continue to consume liquids/water and as the heat rises so also the sudden downpour. The place is a big hit with the kids and you are amazed with the variety of birds here. The not to miss are the flamingos (at the entrance), pelicans ( just on right corner at the entrance...note the feed timings), the pelicans and the ibis.
A giant of waterfall is also an added attraction.

You can easily spend atleast 3-4 hours here, post lunch to include the bird shows. Lots of eateries around. Take the map and go on a exploration ! Walk, walk, and walk to enjoy the place.
If you have time, go for the 4 in 1 pass which includes the Bird park, Zoo, Night safari & River safari. The pass is valid for single entry till 7 days from first entry. The bus/MRT to the place are not that convinient."
,,One of the best bird parks out there...,4.0,,"If you are into nature and wild life, you will appreciate the birds at the Jurong Bird park. One of the oldest attractions in Singapore, it has been kept relevant for a family's day out."
,,Fantastic attraction to visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Visited Jurong Bird Park on our last day in Singapore and had a great time.

The park allows you to get really close to a variety of birds as you can walk thru fully enclosed aviaries.

The highlight was lunch with the parrots where you can enjoy an asian buffet and be entertained by the cockatoos, and macaws as they perform a variety of tricks.

Loved every minute. Beautiful surroundings and entertaining for all ages"
,,Agreat way to spend 4 hours,5.0,,"I thought this was really a great stop on my visit to Singapore. You can catch the MRT to Boon Lay and If you want to travel the reast by taxi it is only S$6. The birds in the Avaries are almost tame and there are plenty of great photo opportunities. The ra[tor display was not bad I cannot compare it to anywere else. Visit the Avaries when there are shows on as they tend to be quieter, no children scaring the birds. Take plenty of water I went through 2 litres in the time I was there, wate can be purchased it is only S$2 for 600 ml bottle. Food I left alone. Remember to wear good comfortable non slip shoes as some of the areas can be wet and a little slippery."
,,nice enjoyable time with mom,4.0,,so many birds to see and they all look so healthy and active. the parrots are cute too and the natural waterfall area is a great experience
,,FABULOUS IF YOU ARE ALONE OR A FAMILY,5.0,,"The Bird Park is a wonderful display of birds from all over the world. We spent hours here, walking around the park looking at the most impressive visits. Do allow yourself time to do this as it is very worthwhile. You can take a tram but you only get fleeting glances of the exhibits. If you walk and you will have to be fit you will enjoy so much more. Get up close to our feathered friends.
I can recommend this for families and even if you are on your own. One of Singapore's must see."
,,Awesome day out with the flying species,5.0,,"We live near the bird park, so.a short 5min drive lands us there..
We alwas go early in e.morning n spend the entire day till closing time!
Lots of birds and entertaining shows to keep you occupied!
Bring extra clothes if ur planning to hav a wet n wild time at the huge water play area.. It's a huge hit with my kids!
I alwas pack burgers, snacks and bottles of juice n water n store it either in our pram or a mini Push trolley..
Food is ex n sparce in the park, so I suggest bring ur own n hav a picnic in the many shady areas down there.."
,,Classic bird show,5.0,,"Everthing about this park is amazing - its not a regular park (not I have seen before) . All type of unseen, unheard birds. And dont miss the shows they have from penguin eating, eagle/Owl and their start attraction bird show. Everything is worth a watch. P.S. Come early morning to watch these shows."
,,Birds have talent too!,4.0,,So many different species of birds are found here. The best part is their show where they perform stunts for the audience. Mindblowing!
,,Nice but no interaction with the birds,4.0,,I felt the Thailand one was better. The vulture and eagle show out here was good. In Thailand one there was plenty of interaction with the Macau birds and others but here they restrict us a lot. Overall nice
,,Rubbish food,1.0,,My husband had a hot dog in one of the restaurants that was disgusting. The bread was sticky and the hot dog tasted of... well dog actually!
,,very interactive,5.0,,This was the first time i visited a bird park and was wondering if there is enough to do or see at a bird park. i was not disappointed. I feel this is the best thing to do in Singapore for families (even more than the zoo). The park is big but easy to get around by walk or the tram service around the park. The area where you can buy some bird feed and the big macaws come and sit on your shoulders or head is a great experience.
,,full day visit a must,5.0,,"the park is amazing and the variety of birds they have omg, flamingos, pelicans, owls, parrots and the shows they show are simply adorable would recommend everyone to have a full day visit"
,,too many closed exibits,3.0,,wasn't like it used to be. so many cages now closed to public access. Birds were few and far between in the waterfall Avery. not sure what is going on but it was really uninteresting and I used to love it.
,,Disappointed,3.0,,A shadow of what it was 7 years ago. Not much energy and definitely is something that can afford to be missed. Nothing compared to the night safari.
,,A nice stroll with the birds,5.0,,I've now been here twice and definitely would go again. The park is very well laid out great walk but if you get tired just jump in the travelling trams which can take you around the park. My favourite part is lory loft as you get to feed the birds who decide that you are their new play ground. Great photo opportunity in there. Definitely worth going and great for the family. Staff there are also really great.
,,If you like birds and peace and quiet then go.,5.0,,It's not easy to get there but it's worth it if you like birds. I caved in and got a taxi from the nearest MRT station but you can do it on a bus apparently.
,,Birds all around,5.0,,"This place was brilliant and a must visit, if you like birds. You can view thousands of birds around you. Also you can feed them, click with them and play around. An day well spent."
,,Good with kids,4.0,,This is a kind of zoo specialized in birds. You can visit it walking and enjoyng the fauna from over the world. A special trip for families with kids.
,,SINGAPORE BIRDS PARK,5.0,,"Singapore Bird park shows cannot be forgotten. Although Singapore does not have any birds inside the City, they have created a Park and trained the birds to perform acts which sometimes takes the spine out of you. The birds have been trained in such a way that they get their preys kept on the gloved hands of the trainer and when the fly across each other to get the prey from their trained personnel During your visit you should not miss out the Jurong Birds' park which is unique of its kind."
,,good place for children and people interested in birds,4.0,,"good place for children and people interested in birds. nominal fee is applicable to enter. Love the ambience itself, lovely to walk around or can take a tram from the entrance, you can hop on and off the station to walk around and explore."
,,Worth a visit if you like birds,4.0,,"I took my son out to the bird park, via MRT and bus. It was not difficult to get to.
The birds were well kept but it was very hot and some seemingly were stressed by the heat (panting). There were not a lot of places to go to escape the heat.
They had some beautiful species however and we had the opportunity to see shows and have photos taken. The food and drinks were a bit on the pricey side.
My son played in the waterpark, which he enjoyed immensely."
,,Birds,4.0,,"My husband and I enjoyed our visit to the Bird park, we got to see come birds that we have never seen before. it will take a couple of hours to walk around the park."
,,Good place to visit for both adult and children,5.0,,"Love the ambience itself, lovely to walk around or can take a tram from the entrance, you can hop on and off the station to walk around and explore. Lovely flamingos, pelicans just so many types of birds in beautiful manmade landscape and yet feels like natural habitat. If you driving there, ample parking spaces."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"We didn't have long enough at the park as we took a tour that only allowed 2 hours there. I'll return next trip and spend more time there. Beautifully presented. We were surprised at the great quality of the bird show in the main arena. A bit different to anything else we have experienced with the flock of flamingos on stage! We used the train at first to orientate, then walked back to explore further."
,,Amazing and Memorable Experience,5.0,,"Enjoyed visiting the park. It looks like a rain forest inside. We were thrilled to see each and every bird. Macaws are kept in open area and one can get clicked with macaw in background by paying.
Then comes the Penguins, majestic ones !
All the birds are beautifully managed and there are excellent bird shows available. Keep the track of the timings of show and make sure you visit them without fail. It is going to be one amazing experience
I would recommend going inside Lory loft enclosure and buy their food to feed them. They come very close to you and perch on your hand and shoulders while you feed them( photos attached). This is a must in Jurong Bird Park and you will get one amazing photoshoot with beautiful loris.
The Park has shuttle which stops at every station and they provide overview of the birds as well.

In short, I would say one of the amazing and memorable experience. Must visit in Singapore"
,,Cant really see many birds this time round,3.0,,"Bringing my family there, but it seens like not many bird can be see compare my last visit few years back. The train are not free & need to pay for the train for ONLY one seating....rather hot if you go noon, suggest to go morning..."
,,Wonderful day out,5.0,,"I chose to go to the bird park thinking it would be something to do for an hour or so, but was so wrong. My partner and I spent four hours being thrilled by not only the beautiful birds but by the beautiful setting and professionalism of the team here. Not only are there beautiful birds from all around the world on view but there are several opportunities available to interact with them too. This is not only for kids but for anyone with a interest in birds and preservation. Make sure and feed the birds and view the chicks in the incubators too. Not to be missed"
,,Fantastic park,5.0,,"We very much enjoyed or visit to the park. We do so on a Tour East tour and our guide assisted us in making the most of the park. We saw two excellent bird shows. The first was the raptor show with eagles, vultures, owns and hawks. The second was with a variety of colorful birds that wowed us with their tricks. Very well done. Also, enjoyed the penguins and some of the other exhibits. We enjoyed the lorry loft, where the colorful Australian birds come up very close to you."
,,View Unique Birds,5.0,,"Set in a rain forest area - habitat as birds would be in the wild. Large variety of unique birds with a couple of really huge walk through enclosures. Food was good and not expensive. The staff were really friendly & helpful. (BIG thank you to Nadia at reception - REALLY bubbly, helpful & full of good information Two things that might add to the experience would be more ramps for disabled and the use of glass in some areas due to wire preventing some really great photo opportunities. Overall, we had 5 really great hours there."
,,Good one,3.0,,"If you have kids or u love watching birds then it's must on the itinary.It has many types of birds all around the world.The Feeding shows are not worth as it has been marketed.Its just feeding the birds while the presenter tells about bird.The high flyer show is good.The Falcons show is okay.
The manmade waterfall is one of the best thing in Jurong Park but the Waterfall aviary is not so."
,,Amazing birds from Toucans to Penguins,5.0,,"We purchased a two hopper park pass (heaps of options available) at the venue. Cost was $67 per adult & 44 per child (under 12) NZD (the other great park we chose to visit was the night safari, which was also amazing).

We went on a Sunday and it was busy, the highlights were definitely the birds of prey show & the high flyers show.

Great value for money, we found it very very hot & humid (although we admittedly are not used to this heat/humidity)

They offered a tram tour at an additional cost ($5 per adult), we chose to walk but it would have been easier to take the tram.

Childs play are includes water play so if under 12's (approx.) pack swim wear.

One of my top two Singapore attractions."
,,SINGING BIRD ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS!!!!!,5.0,,"Like Singapore Zoo, Jurong Bird Park is set amongst the most amazing rain forrest foliage.

It houses some really amazing birds & has a number of really neat live shows to watch.

The staff that ran the shows were amazing! We especially loved the guy who ran the first show, that had Owls & Falcons in it. He was so funny with his jokes, like when he kept pretending to give a voucher to the lady who had volunteered. It was hilarious.

As was the other big show in the middle of the day, where this beautiful green parrot counted to 10 in 3 different languages & then sang 3 diff songs in 3 diff languages. People were crying with laughter.

We got around the entire park in 2/3 of a day, giving us time to shop at the Jurong Shopping Centre nearby."
,,Good for children and family!,4.0,,This is definitely the nicest bird park i have been to by now. Its actually large than what i have seen at other place. There are rare bird shows that happens here which you probably wont find anywhere else and with many different spices of bird rather than just parrot that i have seen at other parks. This park has so many species of birds that are hard to find or see now a days. beautiful park with beauty of nature in hands of human well maintained.
,,Not bad,3.0,,"I wouldn't return to the Bird Park again. I don't think any birds of prey show can compare to the one at O'Reilly's rainforest retreat but that would be due to crowd numbers as O'reillys is in a remote location with about 25 people vs 300 people. The show with the macaws was impressive, especially the talking ""Pablo"". They did a good job with this show.
A few of our family had the photos taken with the birds at the entrance, but they weren't allowed to hold the macaws. When we were in Cairns, the bird park up there, the macaws would fly down & sit on your shoulder. So once again, a bit disappointed, but maybe because I have been spoilt by seeing the best already.
We pretty much jumped on the tram the rest of the way around as there was nothing else of interest to me."
,,A good day out.,4.0,,"This was a nice Bird Park, with some opportunities to feed some birds. The Bird flight show was very good and you get to see vultures, eagles and other birds of prey, with good information given. The penguin encloser was great with up close, good viewing. The snow owls are a must see, such beautiful birds. The main final bird show was great too and you get to take photos at the end with flamingos. Overall a nice day out for both the kids and adults."
,,My Favourite Attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"Though this attraction is kinda inconvenient to travel to as it is located at a rather 'isolated' area in the west of Singapore. But, if you are a birds lover, you have to come here! The shows are fantastic and you will be amazed how clever these little birds are. The birds are so friendly especially the parrots, they will try all methods to get your attention eventhough they are in the cage. I live in Singapore so if l were to vote the best attraction, this will be the one!"
,,Large and clean,4.0,,Had visited the park a number of times 15 years earlier and the little disappointment here is that very little has changed in such a long time. Still a great place but would have expected more changes / modernization of the place.
,,It's alright,4.0,,"Our visit out to the bird park was good, lots of displays and hardly anyone around, but considering it felt like it was 45'c I could understand it. This is the main problem if it wasn't for the heat the park would be MUCH more enjoyable. We could of spent a lot more time there but the heat was unbearable. If you love birds like we do you, will still enjoy it. The different and wide variance of species are amazing."
,,Had a great time,4.0,,I say go to the bird park rather than the zoo. The layout is more friendly and they have a lot more interesting things rather than the zoo.
,,An avian paradise,5.0,,"Its like the coming together of the entire avian world in an area which does not leave you feeling exhausted even in the humid temperatures. While kids seem to have enjoyed it, it was quite a delight to see and hear the birds from across the world. Where else can one see penguins and macaws together? The Jurong Falls can almost transport you to Africa. My personal favorite was the Amazon arena. The only disappointment was to see the majestic birds of prey being kept in enclosures which robbed them of their majesty."
,,A Great outing for family with children,5.0,,Great place with beautiful surroundings.Very cooling even though the sun is scorching hot.Many different types of birds species which can be seen from all different types of country.It will be an eye opening experience.My daughter love the place and especially the live shows of the birds.Definetely worth every single cent! You wouldn't regret visiting Jurong BIrd Park :)
,,Nice visit,5.0,,"Its nice.....parts of it has birds in open. The water park is small, but a nice addition as my kid (6 yrs) had fun....especially since it was a hot day."
,,Singapore surprise!,5.0,,Make sure you get here by 9.30am to be in time for the first bird show at 10am. It cost 28Sd to enter and an extra 5SD for the trolley ride. It's well worth it in the Singapore humidity. Hawk show and parrot shows were a hit with school children and adults alike. The penguin feeding was great to watch too. Wait for a while after the parrot show before boarding the tram to avoid the crowds. It was better to arrive at the 2nd and 3rd stations after most people had left. Make sure you get out at the Waterfall station as it is really lovely. The MRT is really a great way to get here. Go to Boon Lay station (cost SD5 return) then catch bus no 194 or 251 to Bird Park (SD3 return). Try to have correct change for the bus. A great day out. We didn't leave until 2.30pm.
,,Nice bird park with unique experience,4.0,,"It is a big bird park with many different species of birds, some kinds that I have just saw on TV before. And they have a place with web surrounded for tourists to come in and ""feel"" the birds flying over your head, flying over you. It's a thrilled and unique experience (for scaring the birds may hit you :))). They also have another place to feed the parrots and the parrots will climb on your arms."
,,great park,5.0,,loved this jurong bird park... loved the way things are done here ... looks exquisite...birds look healthy and loved the handling with the birds it was a different experience
,,Love the birds!,4.0,,"This was my second visit, having been several years ago. An excellent bird park and I had no sense that the birds were not well treated. Even though it rained I loved to walk around amongst the birds and even struck up a conversation with one that landed next to me! For for families, singles."
,,A little tired,2.0,,I visited this attraction 20yrs earlier. Now returning with my daughter i found it a little tired and in need of a revamp. I'm not sure if i would rush back for a third visit.
,,good place for birds lovers,4.0,,"We spend more than half a day walking along the park, seeing shows. there is a wide array of birds such as penguins, flamingos, hawks, swans, and many more. it was a good stray from the city."
,,Bird lovers paradise,5.0,,"Superb variety of birds, in semi natural settings. A little put off by the circus type shows which probably wouldn't be allowed in the UK, but still plenty to see including Birds of Paradise."
,,Waste of time !!!,1.0,,"No doubt it was very big park but sadly couldn't spot that many birds. Won't recommend this place if you are travelling with kids or elderly people coz you have to walk too much as all the species are scattered. To mention few there were Flamingos, ostrich, penguins, eagles, vultures, hawks, colorful parrots, Ducks, swans, and a few more. Also, I didn't find anything new there as I have been to ""safari world, Bangkok"" which was way better than this. Something that disappointed me the most were the shows, I expected birds will perform some tricks or will entertain us but they just brought birds and shared some details about a few birds which was too boring... for me it was waste of time !"
,,A must visit,4.0,,"The whole place is nicely done up. The show at the amphitheater is a must and one should not miss this. Check timings on their website. The owls a among the rarest to find.

A good place to visit if you are travelling with the kids."
,,A conventional must visit in Sing!,4.0,,"This was my third time in Singapore. However, the first 2 times I had missed this must visit place. I attempted it this time - and it was a pleasant experience. I liked the shows more than walking through and seeing the caged birds."
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"A bird park with a diverse array of birds from around the globe.In addition there are bird shows put on by their handlers at various times. The easiest way to access is by cab and the charges are much less than most other places, in fact a fraction of the cost."
,,Birds eye view (plus tip to visit the Night Safari),4.0,,"The Bird Park is well laid out with good bird groupings e.g. birds of prey etc. The Waterfall Aviary and Scarlet Ibis area were very good. From what I could see, the birds seemed well cared for. Road train was good and not heavily in demand so we were able to use it several times to revisit areas we liked.
Two tips: Firstly, there is a photo opportunity for those taking lunch in the Songbird Terrace. You don't need to do this as you can get great photo opportunities by attending the High Flyers Show, which is free to attend.
Secondly, we learnt by chance there's a coach (16:45 but do check at the ticketing booth) that goes to the Night Safari located some 30 minutes away and collocated by the Zoo. We took the bus (separate fee payable on arrival at the zoo end) which saved us 2 MRT trains and 2 bus rides. By doing this you can visit both attractions). Note you will arrive before the Night Safari opens but there are dining possibilities outside the Night Safari (& Zoo) and you will also be able to watch the free fire eating show in front of the Night Safari gates. You can also buy a dual park entry ticket, go to www.birdpark.com.sg"
,,Interesting birds,4.0,,Lots of colourful birds to look at that also reminded me of past holidays when I saw them in their natural habitats.
,,A relaxing day in the Bird Park of Singapore,5.0,,"The Bird Park in Singapore is really fantastic !!! Kids would love it, especially the Bird shows.
The small train serves well as an hop on/ hop off service, where you can get out to see the birds of your choice. You can even take a photograph with a bird on your hand, though this is a bit expensive. If you are a visitor to Singapore, you need to keep aside a whole day for this activity but it is well worth it."
,,Jurong Birds park,5.0,,"Birds park visit for really enchanting. Started with Penguins, lot many spices of Birds. Attraction is the Rain forest where at specific time rain with thunder will come through artificial means to make the birds feel that they are in their native land. Main attraction are the Parrots with many colours, You have an area where you can feed the Parrots. Parrots will sit on you shoulder / fore arm and will have its food that you feed. Eagles / Vultures are the other attraction. You have two shows one on parrots and the other show is on Big birds like eagle / vulture / Owl"
,,Dont miss it in Singapore,5.0,,Beautiful collection of birds in an open atmosphere. Variety is really mind blowing. Stroll along the park and you will find some real gems of snap shots.
,,Stray and Stay,4.0,,"For visitors, going to Jurong Bird Park would be best by taking a taxi from the City. It is a mere 30-40 minute drive and you get to get there faster than taking the bus. If you wish to experience the street scenes and bus stops, by all means take the commute. But I'd rather stray into the bird park at the earliest possible time and stay in a nature's enclave, escaping the City bustle if only for a day.

Souvenirs, rainfalls, stroll on your own after taking the jungle trolley train find a nice spot and stay there taking in nature's sounds, bird calls and the restful rustle of leaves symphonically singing from the gentle Singapore breeze.

Be sure to watch out for Malaysia or Indonesia fires. If there's one postpone your trip."
,,Great place for bird lovers~,4.0,,"Take some time off and stroll along the park. You'll have to be patient and spend a little more time in order to spot the birds in the aviaries. As birds are small and harder to locate, it is much more difficult to spot them and thus making this place under-rated. Highly recommended to go for the bird show at the Pools Amphitheater."
,,Tropical Birds up close,5.0,,What a fantastic array of tropical birds. Colours were beautiful. The trained bird show was a treat. Hornbills were our favourites
,,Lovely Bird Park for young and old,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is definitely worth a visit. The park in itself is beautiful with lots of luscious green trees and beautiful flowers. You can really enter the world of the birds and admiring them up close. I really liked the sections were you could wander between the birds and you could see them fly and play in their natural habitat.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed feeding the lories. Those lories are kind of brutal though and if you're not careful they'll pull the little food container right out of your hands. For some reason they also enjoy sitting on people's heads. An ideal photo opportunity!

We also enjoyed the High Flyers Show and the Kings of the Skies show. The trainers let the birds fly very close above the audience. Magnificent to see these birds in action. It was even possible to have our picture taken with our own camera by a troop of flamingo's.

I wasn't that fond of the cages with the large birds of prey though. I always feel sad seeing those magnificent birds being confined to such a small cage. I have to add though that Jurong Bird Park puts a lot of effort in conservation and making the public aware of the consequences their actions may have on bird life.

I recommend taking out a full day to enjoy everything this park has to offer."

,,Nice but Not That Nice,3.0,,"I have heard a lot about this park; it was nice but compared to Malaysian Bird Park it did not meet my expectation. Anyway the waterpark for kids was really good. my kid enjoyed at her best. but make sure you are carrying swimsuit for your kid, otherwise you HAVE to buy it from the shop at the park. The park has number of shows and they are fine to watch. The most important think is that the park does has a very good varieties of birds. it was very hot when we visit there, make sure you are carrying umbrella to cover yourself from a burning sun and carrying water bottle."
,,A Photographer's Delight,5.0,,It was an interesting place and highly recommend it if you are in Singapore for a family holiday. A delight for bird lovers and photographers.
,,Bird Paradise,5.0,,"A great day out and lots of diverse and exotic birds that were beautiful to see. Easy to get to by MRT and bus. Get there early for the bird show, I was lucky enough to have a close encounter with a Vulture named Hazel. I especially loved the Flamingos. Definitely worth a trip to see birds I am likely to never see again."
,,A wonderful tryst with nature!,4.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park impresses with it's immaculately maintained landscapes, the beautiful inmates and the amazing shows! I loved the talking parrot singing happy birthday, and the flamingos are a sight to behold. But my favorite section was the penguins...it is delightful to see these creatures in action under water! The bird park is a must visit for all ages who love nature!"
,,great,5.0,,"The huge variety of birds is amazing , and you can interact with some of them , the enclosures are perfect , really great for bird lovers ."
,,Expected more,3.0,,"We were only in Singapore for 1 day and decided to use this precious day at Jurong Bird Park. I had been around 19 years ago and remembered being very impressed.

I have to say that I was a little disappointed. The girls at the booking office were not very friendly to start with.

We really liked the exhibits at the beginning of the park (flamingos) but it went downhill from there. We had to do a lot of walking and even though we paid for the tram, it didn't seem to work for us. Either just missing one, or wanted to see something in between tram stops. When we did arrive at each exhibit, it was hard to see the birds we really wanted to see, like the Hornbills and Toucans. Some of the exhibits didn't seem clean and the birds looked unhappy to us (penguins, owls, pelicans)

The show was OK. My children enjoyed it but I found it loud and a bit over the top. We got seats towards the back and it was hard to see the birds from up there.

Once you got into the park there was no where to eat. Only snack food available. So we ate before we went inside and the food was very average and expensive.

There were the occasional exhibit that we enjoyed. I'm glad that I took my kids once but will probably never go back."
,,Never seen so many birds together,5.0,,Whether it was the Birds of Prey or the Lorries or the Hornbills - everything about it was so colorful. The souvenir shop was too good. We collected some miniature bird figures from here which were simply flawless.
,,Lunch with the Parrots,5.0,,"A relaxed park, with lots of variety of birds from around the world. We decided to have 'lunch with the parrots'. The food wasn't to our taste ( not a great deal of variety for western travellers) but that aside, a very good educational and fun show, with the opportunity to volunteer to be part of the show. Similar set up to the zoo, with a tram operating around the park with easy hop on/off. The best experience within the park is the Lori Loft, a 5 storey aviary where you can experience first hand feeding the birds. Purchase a pot of nectar as you walk in, and within seconds you have made friends with 5 or 6 Lori birds. Plenty of photograph opportunities here. Also if travelling with children, there is a very clean water play area, so they can cool off and you can have a welcome rest. The king of the sky show is very good, with some large birds on show."
,,An Evening well spent,4.0,,"I loved this place, it has variety of birds, some of them are really beautiful. i loved scarlet the most. loved feeding session , where we could feed many bright colourful parrots."
,,Unique Venue for Large Variety of Bird Species - Bird Shows,5.0,,"Not too sure if there is any other place in the world where one gets to see so many species of Birds roaming freely and feeling absolutely at home as you walk by them. A couple of Shows held here are truly sensational and are a hit with the Tourists. Particular mention needs to be made of the shows titled ""High Fliers"" and ""Kings of The Sky"" where one is treated to the spectacle of watching Birds that have been trained, display their skills and follow the instructions of their trainers. A place to definitely visit along with family as there is so much on offer for everyone. Feeding sessions with Pelicans, Penguins, Ostriches etc make you feel one with the Birds. Special mention needs to be made of my favourite enclosure - Lory's Loft where one gets to feed the Lorakeets and other small Birds and watch them from close quarters. Not to forget the enclosure for HornBills, Eagles etc. Overall a must visit for anyone coming to Singapore especially with children."
,,a great day out,5.0,,"the bird park was great so many different birds , the walk is easy the settings for the birds very good , food was good in the cafe all in all worth going for good days visit"
,,Wonderful experience for kids,4.0,,Its a great day out if you have kids. They will enjoy seeing the different types of birds and the show at the end.
,,Superb!,5.0,,"My three-year-old son loves birds and so, we weren't going to miss this park for anything. We bought our tickets at the park itself, and the queue was long, but it moved fast. Once inside, my son especially enjoyed the Lory Loft, where one of the staff members who was very friendly with the birds helped my son to get a bird to sit on his hand. He was delighted!! We also went for the bird show, and it was an entertaining programme. There are lots of photo-ops at the park, and we loved that! The food options at the park were limited, but not bad."
,,Where colour lives,5.0,,"5 stars would fall short for this beautiful park. A must visit park for those who love birds. The place is easy to go. MRT and Bus would be highly recommended. Bus number 194 goes to jurong bird park. We got composite tickets for 3 parks. The zoo, nightsafari and bird park. You can try for river safari too which we heard is also very good,but unfortunately it was closed when we went.
You can roam around the park in trams. Japanese and mandarine trams are also available.We prefered to walk around in the nature. You wont feel you are in a park. It as been brillantly designed to give you the jungle look. There are little sitting areas for resting. The birds are fearless specially the lories. The lory loft is a must visit specially if you have children, Its a 9 storey high enclosure with lush greenery where lories eat right from your hand. You need to buy nectar for them. Dont be scared if 3 lories fight for food sitting on your hand.! Do take a map with you to know the timing for various shows. They are wonderful The park has been divided into various zones example..penguin coast, horn-bill area, waterfall aviary, pelican cove, wings of Asia etc, I never expected to see the birds of paradise in there, which I have seen only in Nat Geo a documentary by David Attenborough. and also Shoebill bird which is found in Zambia and Ethiopia. I dont know if this life would give me a chance to travel all the way to Ethiopia to see such bird, but thanks to Jurong Bird park, it was fulfilled. And dont forget to visit the bird breeding center. Its beautiful and very overwhelming how they treat the newly born bird, and ill birds. Lastly the birds are everywhere may be hiding in the foliage or around the bushes have patience and be silent they will come near you."
,,Wear a hat! HAHA,5.0,,Birds of all kinds around you (and above you). The shows were excellent with clear commentary in English. We saw all of them through the day and can't imagine enjoying the Park unless you give yourself at least 6 hours. I discovered my new favourite bird - the shoebill. But it was exciting to see cassowaries after a recent trip we had to the Australian Daintree Rainforest where many cassowaries reside but didn't show their faces!
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"This was my second trip to Singapore. I missed Jurong, when during my first trip. However, I travelled with my two daughters this time and therefore pre-booked my visit there. I must say its beautiful and their bird shows are really enthralling and exciting."
,,"Nice, better than expected",4.0,,"Nice Bird Park, much better than we expected. Not just for kids, you will also enjoy a lot on your own. I would just request a bit bigger cages for some of the large birds. We left a comment behind to improve this."
,,Great interactive experience,5.0,,Visited with family which included a toddler and the ability to feed the birds - they all alighted on arms and railings nearby allowed us all to get an up close look at the beautiful coloring of their plumage. Very fun! Highly recommend it!
,,A good day out at the bird park,4.0,,"This is a very good bird park, full of many wonderful different kinds of birds from around the world. There are two main features which stand out, one being the Lory Loft where many small birds are flying around and you can feed them, and second being the Waterfall Aviary which again has many birds flying around as well as a 100ft waterfall feature. It was a good day out, but not as good as the Zoo."
,,"Interesting array of birds, possibly cruel though",3.0,,"Enjoyed my walk around the park this morning (you'd need 3 hours or so to cover it.) a few of the averies did appear harshly small though I must admit (poor owls!) the Zoo was a better experience, you'd not miss too much if you didn't go here."
,,Not so good,4.0,,"The bird park we visited a few years previously was indeed a truly lovely day out, am afraid it has deteriorated since the walk in aviary with it's beautiful waterfall is still a good attraction but I'm afraid the free flying birds are no longer as numerous or colourful"
,,Our feathered friends,4.0,,"This was a great place to visit if you enjoy watching all the different types of birds. I bought some liquid food and fed the birds at the Lory loft, this was good fun and had a picture taken with the bird trying to eat my hat. The birds of prey show was later in the day so would miss it but by luck one was out having exercise with the keeper so we managed to have our own private show. Really enjoyed it here only downside was cafe and shop needed updating a little."
,,fantabulous...,5.0,,nicely maintained...can't imagine the amount of work put upon creating that...could be more helpful if more helping staff have been employed
,,Worth one visit,4.0,,The birds are gorgeous and freely move around the bird park. The Lory cage is amazing... to have the birds so close and eating off the cups.
,,Wonderful birds!,5.0,,"A theme park based on birds only! makes you wonder what it would be like. But it is a delightful experience to watch the birds in all shapes, sizes and colors. The show with trained birds is really memorable and when the small colorful birds come and sit on your hands and head, thats a photograph you cannot miss!"
,,Fun,5.0,,This is one of the best bird parks in the world. It has hundreds of different species and a lot of information. You need to allow plenty of time to get round but it is well worth it.
,,Enjoyable,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a great place to visit in the west area.

you can bring you small kids with baby stroller without any problem. accessing all area should be easy and without any barrier.

You can enjoy up to 3-4 hours spending in this full of tree and birds place. Penguin (right hand side at entrance) and the bird show (twice a day, 10:30 and 3pm) are definitely enjoyable for everyone. and the Perrot feeding at Lory Loft is very enjoyable too while you can touch the lovely bird.

There is suggest itinerary in the website but I ends up cannot follow the flow (afternoon). I didn't take the train, and the itinerary ask you go west, north east then back to north west. I wonder how could I follow the itinerary even use the train?

but the is not the problem. the bird park is not that big, a normal kid should be able to walk the entire bird park without being too tired. just follow your sense, start from the west and follow the road.

the only water supply I can spotted is outside of science center. you can get clean water from there. if you are with family and don't want to spend to much on water, bring some and refill here. buying water at vending machine cost S$3 to S$5 depending on what you buy.

Accessing Jurong bird park is not that straight forward. if you are taking Taxi, then you have no problem. if you want go by public transport, taking EW line from central to Jurong point takes about 30 minutes, 10 min+ walk to transit and then 10 minutes bus ride (1 stop, use same bus station back to Jurong point). considering you need two way, I would suggest at least take one way taxi. you can enjoy some good food at Jurong point."
,,great shows,4.0,,whilst it isnt to get to this place by general transport it is worth the visit for the shows so get there early.
,,Birds paradise,4.0,,"It's a real treat for all bird lovers.One of the icon tourist attraction in Singapore,a must visit for all tourist."
,,Fun,4.0,,There is a huge range of birds and all their shows are awesome! You can take pictures with the birds! The pictures are a little pricey but totally worth it
,,a sweet experience,5.0,,a beautifully maintained bird park with lots of variety of birds and a great bird show with live birds very well trained a treat to watch
,,must see place for people who loves bird watching,5.0,,lure bird feeding is very fun.good lots of various species of bird.various shows performed by birds are awesome.breakfast with birds is must try.bird feeding session are fun for all ages
,,Nice show and beautiful surrounding,5.0,,"Good place to visit, different types of birds and also nice bird show. You don't be surprise that bird is so intelligent."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The way they train the birds here, is unparalleled. I had not seen such training elsewhere. Kudos to them. I wish I could do the same."
,,great place to learn a lot about birds,4.0,,"it was great, we've learnt so much about birds. we didnt miss a single show, and also got the chance to volunteer for one show. great experience. do not miss the shows."
,,Poor Experience,2.0,,I had a poor experience because there is nothing fun to see there except seeing the same birds non-stop Maybe u could: add a few rides like a bird ride to make it more interesting
,,Simple,3.0,,"Its good to have a visit to see how other places have things to show in their own different way. Further, bird lovers might have a good time siting out many. Perfectly a place for the photographers as well."
,,An amazing bird collection,5.0,,"As a bird lover I was amazed at the variety of birds from all over the world, yes some of the closed avaries were a little small, but the walk through averies were great, to get close up to so many birds, my camera was continously clicking!
there are food outlets around the park, a very good map to follow and we had no trouble getting there on train and bus,every one is very helpful with directions.I would reccommend this park especially if you have children."
,,Much Improvement,4.0,,"I brought my young daughter because there was a promotion under SG50. It turned to be a good value for money ticket as we enjoyed the bird shows and the displays. The food and drinks were rather expensive but it is not crowded and a good place to relax with young kids.

When the water play area is open, though not as large as the zoo, still it is good to bring younger kids and easier to keep an eye on them."
,,Good for Interacting with Lories,3.0,,"The Lories are the sweetest. They interact nicely with people. The place is clean and It is a nice sanctuary for some birds, but there are species there that do not have the proper environment."
,,Birds Birds & ONly birds,5.0,,"I never thought our planet had these many birds. the lory loft, the eagles the collection is just amazing. I have been there twice and just love it."
,,World of Birds,4.0,,A must visit place to see wide species of birds. you can spend around 3 to 4 hours there. There is a show at the amphitheatre everyday
,,A must see,5.0,,"I was both lucky and unlucky visiting this Bird Park, lucky enough to get up close to some wonderful free flying birds who see park visitors as a source of food, however I was unlucky to be there when the afternoon rains came in so missed seeing more of the attractions on offer"
,,Excellent for kids and adults alike!,5.0,,"Who doesn't like birds!! And there are lots and lots of birds with some good shows. I was elated to see that many birds were kept in a large enclosure, almost like a tropical forest. But at the same time I felt saddened by the birds, especially the eagles and similar big birds in cages. I am personally against keeping birds in cages. Maybe they can construct a large enough enclosure, so that these species do not feel completely caged!"
,,Half day solo visit,4.0,,"Went here as I was told it was nice. I really enjoyed my time walking around here. There are some absolutely beautiful birds here, some that you won't see in any other bird park. I would definitely take my family back here. The shows where great & very entertaining. The caged birds appeared to have enough space & clean. The cost was reasonable & offered heaps of packages to combine with other businesses."
,,"Not so great shows, but worth a visit",4.0,,"Take the tram, do not miss the waterfalls area, nicely set artificially. If you are water lovers bring your swim clothes, it would be better to take the ice - bucket and other dips, the kids would love it, it will be sunny so do not dare to walk"
,,For those who love birds,5.0,,"For all those who love birds and their chirping, this is the place you should go. There are a wide range of birds and there also some shows which shows the skills of some trained birds"
,,u have to hand it to the singaporeans..,5.0,,something new every single time i have been there.. and i have been to jurong 6 times! make sure u do respect the discipline of the place..
,,So so visit,3.0,,"Although they may have the tallest man made waterfall inside an aviary, I have to say I have seen better bird parks than this. I was disappointed in the condition of the pelicans and the horrible stagnant water they we 're kept in, as well as the flamingos."
,,Lovely day out!,5.0,,Perfect for people of all ages. The bird collection is amazing. The place is so neat and well maintained. Whole day spent here is more than the value of what i have paid for. Highly recommended!
,,Attraction which will appeal to people accross all ages,5.0,,"Visited on 22nd Feb 2015 - morning 9.30am

Suggest to visit this attraction in the morning as the predatory bird show at 10.00am and bird show at 11.00am is better because the birds are more relaxed in the morning.
the park is big enough and one will need about 4 hours to look around. also there is paid programmed on bird feeding and ones who are enthusiast can avail this programme as well.
Bird watching at its interesting best."
,,Good for a day...,5.0,,This is an ideal day trip location.... The roads are well mapped for roaming around.... The variety of birds are great and they are well maintained.... Some them are lost in the trees... You have to wait to see them appear....
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"This park was absolutely brilliant and worth every penny! Numerous birds of every type can be seen, both in and out of the aviaries and the bird shows are brilliant, with trained birds from macaws to Pelicans aking part. A definite must!"
,,Singapore's pride,5.0,,"Jurong bird park is truly a Singapore's pride. Famous for its rarest birds, the place is a must go specially with people with young children, What we really love are the activities, aviary, shows (eagle one is the best), train and the waterfall..."
,,Fun day,5.0,,"We spent a good part of the day at the bird park, and we liked it. We watched some of the shows and the scheduled bird feeding. Although it was an oppressive humid day, we enjoyed looking at the birds and the park itself. It's well done, a combination of nature and landscaping, so there are beautiful flowers and plants as well. It reminded me of Parrot Jungle in Miami but more impressive because Jurong Bird Park contains more birds, such as penguins and owls.

It's a good idea to bring lots of water and to wear a hat and sunscreen. There's a tram that goes around the park to cut down on walking in the heat."
,,highly recommend,5.0,,"excellent bird park, only down fall is all the extra costs for photos way too expensive for photo with birds, bird shows great to see them showing off, lots tricks, nice park to walk around or hop on open bus ride around park,"
,,Superb !,5.0,,"Good shows - lot of birds ! very colourful and friendly birds. Also, convenient with respect to walking paths / toilets / food / wheelchair access etc."
,,Eclectus and Lorries?,2.0,,"I've raised Eclectus parrots and lorikeets, and as someone excited to see the world's biggest bird park I was absolutely mortified to see Eclectus parrots at the Lorikeet cafe. Why? Well, both species of parrot have incredibly different food needs. Due to an abnormally long gut Eclectus need primarily fruit diets whilst Lorikeets often struggle eating solid food so eat nectar only usually.

Tourists were being given cups of nectar formula and being encouraged to feed it to both species of parrots. That's not healthy in the slightest and quite worrying for such a well-known bird park."
,,FUN FOR ALL AGES,5.0,,"One of the most beautiful parks/sanctuaries which I have visited. If you haven't been there, this place is a ""MUST"", for all ages. The sheer variety of birds on this property are astounding. The way in which they are kept/protected is truly amazing. The aviary is one of the largest in the world and the foliage is all natural, like in the wild. They have a lovely show as well, and a conservation programme, about which they are very happy to tell you."
,,Pretty Park,4.0,,Birds are the key feature. Very well designed. Large place so little children may get tired. Aviaries were well designed. Plenty of space for the birds. Macaws were fighting. Maybe a bigger space for them as overcrowded. Otherwise nice park to get to. Came by public bus from MRT so not too far unlike the Zoo. You need to go back to the same bus stop to get back to MRT. This was not too clear on signage at the park upon leaving.
,,Discount if ...,3.0,,"... you flew Singapore Airlines and can show some proof. Also, don't bother with the 'train' fee, no-one checked and it seems to be a free for all. The best part of the park is the waterpark inside which is free once you are in. The maps are very misleading (in a good way) ... everything is closer than you think !"
,,Nice for a few hours,3.0,,"Lots of hills , not for those that struggle in the heat , Lots of different birds Great kids arearea"
,,Birds! Birds!!!,5.0,,Wow...u can see almost all the bird species ... colors... In between shows...are very informative...don't miss this
,,Be ready to be amazed!!,5.0,,"This was one of the highlights of our trip!! Watching all these ""flocks"" of birds was indeed a treat to our eyes and minds.. Be ready to spend some time there, else the visit would be a worthless one. The highlight of the park are the shows that they conduct. Be it be the ""high flyers"" or the ""birds and buddies"" one, they are just awesome!! Kids would be the best recipients of these. So, don't forget to visit this place if you're planning to go to Singapore."
,,Second visit,4.0,,"OK, so this was out second visit to Jurong Bird Park. This isn't a day trip, but you can comfortably spending around 3 - 4 hours here. The bird shows are worth waiting for. If you want to be part of the show, sit about half way between front and back. Chances are you'll be picked. Also remember some water as it can get hot whilst waiting for the show to start.

The waterfall is beautiful and a nice place to stop and take it all in.

Feeding the birds in the aviary is also an incredible experience. The kids love doing this. Recommend you do this earlier rather than later as the birds do get full, so if you do go later they may not be interested in the food you purchased for them.

Take a walk around the aviary and keep an eye out for lizards, nor sure what they were but they rest in the tree branches and are about 80 cm's in length.

Because there isn't a lot around Jurong Bird Park, plan your transport so you dont have to wait to long for a taxi. They do come, but you may need to wait 5 - 10 minutes."
,,Bird show great....,3.0,,"Hmmm, was expecting a bit more from this place. Loved the bird show but the bird cages, gardens weren't that great to be honest. Can be a bit boring after 2-3 cages."
,,Dont miss it!,5.0,,There are some shows in the jurong bird park. Plan your visit accordingly not to miss the shows. You will find variety of birds species and enjoy feeding the birds. One half day needed to see this. Its enjoyable especially with kids
,,Amazing bird show,4.0,,"trained parrots stole the show! Kudos to the trainers who all did a great job .good to visit when the sun is not too hot ,early morning or late afternoon.hydrate ! Lots to see !"
,,"Few Genus, Multiple Species",4.0,,"Went about noon on a pleasant day, stayed about 3 hours. Got to see most of the Park, but only got to see one show. The High Flying Bird Show was well done (and is much like the one at SeaWorld). They have a pretty good selection of birds. Feeding the Lorikeets was, as usual when visiting this type of place, a highlight. All in all, wish I could have stayed longer, and it was worth the price. Worth the fee."
,,The one in Malaysia is much better,2.0,,"Not a lot of opportunity for interaction with birds here. Most birds are in cages so you hardly see them flying around freely. Like the title of this review says, the one in Kuala Lumpur is much better"
,,A place for bird lovers,4.0,,If you are a bird lover then this definitely is the place for you. You get to see the birds from all over the world. You can click pics with birds on ur hand. They are huge big birds. They are taken very good care of and most of them are even left on the open. There is a waterfall inside as well which is beautiful and you will get to see and spot many birds. We attended a feeding session and were happy to see it. There is also a small train that will take you all throughout the park but we preferred to walk and enjoy our morning.
,,Bird Show is a fantastic treat,4.0,,"U shud visit this for the bird show and the hatchery. Nothing additional to see. After the show, get your photos clicked with flamingos"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"The kind of species , in a very controlled environment that Bird park has created deserves a credit, you won't find such a variety of species from different Penguins, to different kinds of Owl's..hawaks ..eagles etc etc.. etc, from across the Globe at one place.."
,,Nature experience,4.0,,"This bird tour was amazing. If you really want to experience it, you need to walk. You can really experience nature and hear all the bird sounds."
,,The best Bird park ..,5.0,,"Singapore means neat and structured & the Bird park is no exception. Though it is faroff from city center or orchard street, Its worth a visit - Must see. Don't think they have missed out on any birds from anywhere in the world :-) .... in their natural environment as well"
,,Relaxing Day,5.0,,Loved spending time with the birds. Different sorts of birds. Loved feeding them. Always take a day off here to relax.
,,Don't let them nest in your hair,4.0,,"This bird park was a favorite of our hosts in Singapore, so we did the tour. It was unforgettable, as one part of the tour led on walkways through a huge outdoor cage filled with hundreds of gorgeously colored tropical birds. They were very tame, swooping in to take fruit from our hands. Another highlight was the outdoor bird demonstration, with large raptors being sent out to intrepid volunteer audience members.

Recommended."
,,Best Bird Park in the World,5.0,,"What can one say about Jurong Bird Park that hasn't already been said? It's huge! You can easily spend a full day here and not see everything. If you're young, walk around; otherwise take the tram to the Waterfall Station and work your way down. Two places have shows: Pools Amphitheater (where most people go) and the Hawk Arena (which most people miss). Be sure to stop at Songbird Terrace for ""Lunch with Parrots"" but do it in mid-morning or mid-afternoon when it isn't so crowded. And allow yourself a LOT of time for Lory Loft where my wife had an absolute ball feeding the Lories."
,,What fun!,5.0,,"Lovely lovely birds! They are so well trained!! If you wanna experience something new and exotic, this is the place to be! Well managed and lovely place. Went there during my anniversary outing to Singapore. If you are in Singapore, this is a Must watch place!"
,,Bird paradise,5.0,,"A must visit place for bird lovers. Not only the kids but even elders can enjoy viewing the various types of birds. I had visited the place in Feb 15. A normal taxi from ClarkeQuay to Jurong bird park in the morning should take around SGD20 and is about 25mins drive. Make sure you reach there early around 9.30am. Also cheaper to buy park hopper tickets which has many combinations if you will be visiting Bird park/Zoo/River safari/night safari etc. Hopper park ticket is valid for 7 days from 1st day of use. 1st show at Jurong bird park starts at 10.00am and the subsequent 2nd bird show is at 11am. Once you have seen both the shows, you are pretty much free to roam about in the park. Make sure you do visit the Lory Loft enclosure and around 4pm when I found more birds tend to come close to you to sip the fruit juice. Also with the repeat of the morning show is at that time, you will find it less crowded as people who had missed the morning show would be attending this show."
,,Don't miss it,4.0,,"Is a very popular attraction. We managed to get the online tickets which included the zoo, night safari as well as the bird park. The best part is the bird shows so plan your trip accordingly. One thing that I didn't like is the parrot enclosures. They seemed kinda cramped and too many birds stuffed into cages that could've been bigger. Parrots are intelligent and it seemed a waste to keep them caged up thus."
,,The Bird Show is fine but the Lory Loft Aviary is something else!,5.0,,"We visited in December a few years back and have wonderful memories of the Jurong Bird Park in Singapore. Better to come on your own time than those rushed half-day tours because there is so much walking to do if you wish to see more of the park than just the Bird Show. The Bird Show is indeed nice but the tours time themselves accordingly and you barely get time to spend in the higher sections of the park. Most people out of shape give up walking up...but then they miss out on the most amazing experience of the Lory Loft.

The Lory Loft is a full enclosed sky walk with birds of various plumage and color...you buy bird seeds at their counter - some really friendly staff there who provide you with a jacket. and viola! magically you have birds flying from all over to get into the seed cup! Simply a wonderful feeling, walking through the sky walk and birds all over flying around, some on your hand, some on your shoulder...some great chirping. Just beware a bit of the talons when they sit on your arms...they don""t mean harm. You get to see up close some of the brightest colours created by God."
,,Loved visiting Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"We went to that park on Wednesday 25 February 2015 and my favourite attraction was World of darkness where I got to see two snowy owls, one male and one female plus I had been hoping to see secretary bird but unfortunately I didn't get to see that although I did get to see my favourite penguin- African penguin!"
,,I am glad to come here,5.0,,"You can see all type of birds and the nature is very nice. Singapore has many nice gardens, parks and I love it"
,,"I am not a birder, but I loved it",4.0,,"I think that Jurong Bird Park has something for everyone. I'm not your typical person interested in birds. I loved the penguin exhibit (went twice!), the owls were amazing, and I did not expect the 100 foot waterfall. It was a good Sunday afternoon outing. Very glad I did it!"
,,Must see if you have time,4.0,,"Beautiful colorful birds of every kind, the nursery and research center were really great to see and excellent piece of information, nice shows and well trained birds, good 3-4 hours of relaxation. With children its definitely a must."
,,Interaction !,4.0,,"Jurong bird park located far away from the main city and is worth a visit, if you like to see different kinds of birds flying freely in the air. 2 hectares of land is also not a problem as they have a tram which takes only $5 and takes you for a ride in the park. Although, riding on a tram has its own limitations as they wont give you free time to visit a particular attraction in the park.

The main problem which occurs, if you are not a local, is to come back to your hotel from the park when it closes at 6 pm. There are no taxis available and you would have to take the bus which passes the bird park and then change buses according to your destination."
,,OK,3.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is not one of Singapore's major attractions, but if you have done the main ones, it still is fine for a nice half day out. The park is beautifully landscaped and relatively quiet, so it's good for a stroll. Most of the birds are however difficult to see as the wire netting of the cages is far too thick - so in many cases you won't be able to take good pictures of the birds either. The presentation could be much better in this sense. Also we consider the park to be expensive for what there is to see, especially if you compare it with the zoo or River Safari."
,,Bird View,4.0,,The place is good for bird lover. You can find many speicies. They also have a tram service inside the park.
,,Nice day trip,4.0,,Was really nice seeing all the birds and the shows available. Fun day out. Quite a lot to see and was reasonably priced
,,nice place if you go with kids,4.0,,Really nice place if you travel with kids. they will love it most .nice surrounding with good variety of birds.
,,Colour and interaction,5.0,,The lorikeets were my favorite. ..they climb on you licking salt off you. Amazing. If you are active don't bother with the extra $5 for the tram. The park is small and easily walked between exhibits even in the heat. Plus no tickets were checked.
,,High Flyers is the high point,3.0,,"If you've been to natural bird sanctuaries in the S.E Asia, Jurong might not have anything new to offer. However the High Flyers show is a must-see.
Getting here is convenient, there is a SAEx bus that picks up visitors from various stops in the city, for a flat fee of SGD 6 per head. But getting back to the city can be a bit of a problem - leave the park earlier to coordinate with the SAEx timings, or take bus 194 to Boon Lay MRT (Green)."
,,Enjoys Birds Show,4.0,,"What I like in Jurong is Birds Show. Although this was not the 1st time but I always watch this show. The rest is only watching all the birds inside their cages. My niece and nephew also love that show. I don't like food price in a restaurant, it is too pricey compare to the taste. The toilet near Birds Show was so smelly, it was not so clean. Need more attention for toilet cleanliness."
,,"Nice, but far away",3.0,,"Jurong bird park is worth a visit if you like to see exotic birds partly flying free (There is a two hectares big covered area where birds are flying free like in nature). A problem, however, is to come back to town after the visit, and especially at 6 p.m. when the park closes. There is a taxi stand outside the gate, but no taxis at that time. Either you have to leave the park earlier or take the bus 194, which is passing the bird park every 15th minute."
,,Love this place,5.0,,"Enjoyed this - joined the tour. It offers great interactions - was able to get close the birds and take amazing pictures.

I would not recommend tours - go and explore on your own time. I didn't bother with the tram although families with children will benefit and enjoy this.

I loved the hornbills and eagles and the man made waterfall was pretty cool. The show is amazing dont miss it.

The pelicans and assortment of flamingos were just fascinating. They are moving this close to the zoo in the next five years. Photo opportunity maybe slightly expensive?"
,,if you really run out of options,2.0,,"if you run out of options, bird park is the place to be. nothing special, nothing spectacular. for adults, very boring. for kids soso"
,,Plenty of Birds!,3.0,,"Jurong Bird Park ticks all the boxes if you like to see as many different varieties of birds as possible. The shows are the highlight of the visit, closely followed by the Lory Loft. Kids will love this place and there is a nice water park for them to cool down (remember to pack swimming clothes to avoid child disappointment).
The bird park is located quite some distance from the normal tourist area so getting there is only really practical by taxi, although do expect a long wait at the taxi stand when you leave. The bird park should consider setting up a shuttle from an MRT station. There are refreshments available however, these are average quality and inflated cost.
Remember to pack the sun cream as there is a lot of walking around and not so much shade. There is a road train offered (extra-cost), however, this is usually crowded (long wait)."
,,Not soo great,3.0,,We were little disillusionated about our visit there.It was not so very breathtaking what is offered to see. You may not miss very much when you skip this location.
,,The shows are the highlight,4.0,,"The bird shows is the best part of this attraction esp the high flyer. Lory loft and the penguins r also great fun.You will find lotsa varieties of birds. You can also take pics with parrots and flamingos. But for photos with parrots which is at the entrance and overpriced, the price is not fixed. We thought we ended up paying much more for the photos..."
,,excellent,5.0,,i like this plce very much. the man made waterfall is really awsome. it is beeter to take walk then to take transport to visit all spot
,,Perfect for bird lovers,5.0,,"Not that easy to reach if you are using public transport as miles away from any other attraction in Singapore but worth visiting if you love birds. They do have an amazing selection of birds from all over the world though mostly concentrating on Asian types. The parrots aviary is great with large enough enclosures to keep the birds happy which is also helped by toys the parrots are given to keep them busy. The park offers various shows during the day to entertain visitors and raise awareness about birds. Children will enjoy bird feeding activities (a small fee is charged for the food). The park is easily reachable on foot though those tired of the heat and the humidity can hop on the tram that takes you around the place.
Downside - the food selection is not that great and little choice.
Plus - there was a little friendly bird interested in our shoes :-)"
,,Nice place!,5.0,,"This is the one and only singapore bird park located at jurong. Inside you can see different types of birds, taking pictures of them and even interacting with them, it is a great experience and also a great place for photography, staffs are all very friendly as well. However skip this attraction if its raining very heavy. Thumbs up !!"
,,May skip if short of time,4.0,,"If you are running short of time you may skip visiting this place, however if you at leisure and if you are traveling with kids do consider visiting Jurong Bird park. 4 hours are just enough. Go around the park on tram, get off at all stops and stroll around to watch birds kept in big cages but make sure that you don't miss 'The High flyer' show which is the most important attraction of the park."
,,Exquisite,5.0,,"If one wants to appreciate nature beauty, jurong is the place to be. The collection of birds is just excellent."
,,What a fun place to be!,5.0,,They have an incredible selection of birds and shows. Everything is done with respect to the animals and we didn't think any of them looked unhappy. Make sure you check the times for the shows as they are all worth it. You can take the tram around to manage your time better but you can totally walk through the park. A great place to visit with family or friends. We had a blast!
,,Amazing park and had a chance to feed the ostrich and peacocks,5.0,,Park is excellent and another not to be missed site. Come early and spend the day and watch all the feedings. You get a chance to feed the ostriches and other birds. It is really very cool. The park's website lists suggested itineraries that are timed with the feeding. Time passes very quickly and i did not noticed that 5 hours passed. Thee is so much to see and do.
,,Very nice bird collection,4.0,,"The park is in a large green setting in Jurong area The bird collection was wonderful. The bird park has a lot of beautiful birds. and very interesting performance shows , Shows were entertaining and nice, Kings of the Skies Show, High Flyers Show....Lots of facilities, toilets, cafes and restaurants and shop."
,,Great,5.0,,"Really had a super time with my kid. My kid really enjoyed the bird show. It's little far from centre of the city but it's okay tiredness must vanish when you once enter there, very green place there is toy ride similar to toy train, people could explore the jungle at once with convenient toy ride. When tired by exploring reason of humidity there is only one good place to seat around is penguins hall very cold and there are some benches for sitting purpose. Over all its great place :-)"
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,"Jurong bird park is absolutely lovely. Small enough to cover without seriously straining yourself and the many shaded walkways are a blessing in the heat and humidity.
Favorite exhibits: the parrots, toucans and the blue pigeons. Also the lovely enclosed waterfall exhibit.
Favorite shows: Birds of prey :)

Cons: getting there! It's the other end of the world. Still very well connected unlike the zoo and accessible by MRT (Boon Lay) and bus though it's probably best to cab it. If you are 3 or more people cab typically costs less than the tourist buses.

Carry food as eating options are not great. You can buy water and ice cream across the park though."
,,Felt sorry for the owls,3.0,,Amazing place but some of the cages need to be upgraded sooner rather later. The owls area were small and the poor birds looked sad in their boxed in area not a thing natural about it. Birds in the open aviary had the space to fly around but felt sorry for the ones caged in a small environment.
,,faboulous.,5.0,,"Well laid out with lots of exhibits. Good descriptions of all the birds.Many walk in aviaries.You can purchase tram rides around the place , extra cost, that gives a commentary. Food can be purchased along the way at ok prices.Professional photographer atthe exit for pics with some of the birds.Try and see the show at the aamphitheater (11 am and 3 pm)Just amazing.Food also availiable at the exit/entry as well as Maccas.Be warned.There are lots of steep walks as well as lots of steps.Taxi rank at the door"
,,Unforgettable Visit on 26 Jan 15,5.0,,"Guys can't miss it ! if you r in Singapore and bird lover too.
So TIPS are as Follows:-
1. Book ticket online. I got offer BUY ONE GET ONE FREE.( go to official site or GROUPON)
2. Direct bus till PARK Gate from Jurong Bus terminal.
3. Don't miss any Show. All shows are good and must watch type.
4. Ticket of Tram is not really required as jurong bird park is not very big to visit.
5. Lunch with Parrots is not worth buying if u just want to see the show as they do the same show for public too.( lunch cost is 25$ approx.) so if u want to take the photos with Macaw Parrots at the cheapest that is the only place as photo is free of cost u can just buy cold drink to sit there which cost you 3.5 $.
6. Penguin Cove and the Macaw Parrots are best and worth visiting.

Mail me if you need to know more...."
,,An aviary not to miss,5.0,,"Beautiful birds, nice place to spend a morning or afternoon, strolling and being with the wonderful species of birds. A must for the bird lover."
,,Morning visit at Jurong,5.0,,"We spend our morning at the park. If you have visited a birdpark in KL( Malaysia) it may feel strange to see same birds in cages. But it seems like birds are handled with care and respect by the staff and many of them are actually born in the park. Don't miss to visit parks breeding center!

Park offers a lot of shows with some trained birds hawks, parrots etc."
,,Great day's visit,5.0,,"There were six of us, started early in the day and finished late - there was so much to see. Also lots of areas for little kids to play. The shows were very good and entertaining. Worth buying tickets online to save some money, no need for a printer."
,,Awesome!,4.0,,I took a walk around the park and it was worth it! My favorite stops were the Penguin Cove and the Parrots.
,,LOVELY BIRDS,4.0,,I liked the free birds.the show was very good.the packages offered are very attractive.there are no buses after the late evening show.
,,Paradise on earth,5.0,,"what a great place to visit and watch beautiful birds , I liked lorry bird net , Tuscan birds area with a lot of flowers and great show at 3:00 not miss it"
,,Good live shows,3.0,,"The best part for us was the 3 different bird shows that are put on every day. The parrots in particular were very entertaining. We were a little surprised that the lunch time parrot show was billed as ""lunch with the parrots"" and necessitated in you either purchasing a buffet or drinks to watch the show.

It was a little sad to see the penguins confined to such a small space and one or two seemed a little disturbed seeing their reflection in a mirror.

We thought the highest man made waterfalls in a bird park was a little disappointing. As was the number of birds we saw there. I believe they advertise 600 in the structure, but most must have been hiding or nesting.

Bird feeding at 2.30pm at the waterfalls was also a very nice experience."
,,Amazing show time,4.0,,The bird collection is wonderful and they are not all hidden away in the bushes like you sometimes get. There is a wonderful show time with beautifully colourful birds. Easy to reach by MRT and bus. The friendly bus driver reminded us when we got to the stop.
,,good place for family outing,4.0,,"it have many collections of birds, with a beautiful 'human making' waterfall inside. don't forget to bring your own food if you plan to visit this place, there is only a few choice of cuisine inside the park."
,,Nice Shows,4.0,,"Bird watchers/lovers will like this place although a few birds are kept in 'smallish' cages which I didn't appreciate all that much. The shows are nice, time your visit appropriately otherwise you may miss the shows.

Recommend buying a combo ticket which gives you entry in the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and the Bird Park."
,,Colourful!!!,5.0,,"Not to be missed if you are a wildlife enthusiast. Colorful birds from around the world. Clean,well managed and comfortable to roam around."
,,Good spot for bird lovers,4.0,,"Nice shows, excellent hosting. And ya, nice birds. I liked the Kings of the Skies Show, High Flyers Show. The map is little confusing, follow the crowds or you may miss the show."
,,A Magical Paradise,5.0,,"I was pleasantly surprised. I went only because many had recommended the park to me, though I remained skeptical. After all, what could be so interesting about a lot of birds. Boy was I wrong. From the majestic Snowy Owl, the haughty King Penguins, to the saucy Flamingos and delightfully inquisitive Lories, the birds reminded my family of what a wondrous world we live in. The park itself is a very pleasant haven of towering tress and lovely flowers. Please catch the bird show as well, it's a unique experience."
,,Jurong Bird Jail,3.0,,"This Bird park is very average to say the least, most of the birds are kept in cages, so you can't wander about amongst them. So no good for photographers!

It appears to be run by Indians, and looks like they've spent no $$ on it."
,,Amazing bird show! Must visit!,5.0,,"The shows are wow, specially the wild bird and the vultures doing those amazing stunts! The other shows where the birds are much cuter are a major attraction for the kids. Really loved the way they conducted the entire show. Must visit."
,,Too good birdpark,5.0,,"Must visit this place. It's a great bird park, you will find all types of beautiful birds there, which is difficult to find in any zoo."
,,beautiful birds make your day!!,4.0,,This was really good. My kid enjoyed a lot. Especially tree top walk Cd see many colorful birds. This shall be completed in 3 hr's and head to next attraction. The man made waterfall location was too good.
,,Jurong Bird park,4.0,,A very good place to visit. Children will love it. Needs at least 2 hours to do it. good connectivity by bus. good place to click pictures. A must vist for all ages
,,Enjoyable but dated,3.0,,"Spent an extra $5 a head on the tram ride only to never have tickets checked, some people may not pay for it and then just hop on without being confronted... Just a thought.

Transport issues - Due to the location you are best off with taxis, yes it cost us $12 (with more than $2 tip) to get there from our hotel which wasn't that far away but time is money right? Do you really want to spend time standing in the sun at the bus stop or crammed into the MRT just to save $ when you can be there and back faster?

So as many people point out the park is in need of a lot of improvements, mostly for the well-being of the birds but also for the customers. It was a rather hot day and there were no drinking fountains which was something that I was hoping for as I don't like to have to drink from taps and yet we didn't find too many places selling refreshments ($2 for a bottle of water and Flaming Desarni at that!).

I wouldn't say that we were suckered into buying the photos but there was no mention of prices until it was time to part with the $, we ended up buying the full package which was nearly twice what we (2 adults) paid to get in It was a lot of money but something we won't be doing again.

The best part was the ""Lorry Park"" lorries being a type of bird that feeds on nectar and these little guys go crazy when you buy the $3 cup of feed. It was most enjoyable but here is another spot where they can sell you expensive photos and they got some nice pics of us covered in birds so we wished we had waited.

As we left we thought that we would buy some gifts... Yes we'd already parted with close to $200 but we don't mind when it pays for the upkeep of the birds. We were disappointed to see that there were only a few items in the shop with the Park branding on it. There was way too much cheap tat that could be bought in one of many souvenir stalls anywhere throughout the country."
,,Tired & Faded,2.0,,"Like the plumage on a 1970s Norwegian Blue, this bird park is tired and in desperate need of a major revamp.

Other than adding more and more concrete, not much has been done to the bird park in 20 years. Once one of the top tourist destinations in Singapore, a modernisation is at least ten years overdue. The birds are still in too-small cages - something which may have been OK in the 1980s is not acceptable now. An apt metaphor for Singapore's development.

You should check showtimes for the main show and the raptors before planning your trip.

Getting their is a MRT/bus combination that could take an hour from the city. Worth researching well before you decide on your trip."
,,Quality you would expect of Singapore,5.0,,"Beautifully designed, environmentally aware and supportive of education and conservation, Singapore does this better than anywhere else in the world. There are a huge variety of birds and habitats, could easily have stayed longer."
,,Enjoyed watched birds,4.0,,"Very well maintained zoo. Kids and adults enjoyed watching - rather mingling with birds. Lory loft with bird feeding was a nice. Penguin coast was excellent. Shows were entertaining.

One sad remark is the lack of transparency in cost of photos at the entrance. Before taking photos they told us a price which in the end was different. I hope the authorities will look into this and make a display of the cost for each item. This is least expected in Singapore."
,,get the package,5.0,,"We got the multi package including the zoo and night safari.
Easy to get there via MRT and then the bus.
Bought tickets online to avoid the queues.
Fabulous array of birdlife, from tiny to large birds of prey.
Cages are set out well, and many were very natural looking, in hilly areas rather than all flat.
It is never great to see caged birds, but I think this is as close as you can get without being in the wild.
The free shows are great, where you sit in an outdoor amphitheatre (covered with sails), and various birds fly from the rear, very close over your heads, down to the stage area.
Well trained, and the shows are done with humour, whilst conveying the conservationist message. Not to be missed."
,,Park,5.0,,Wonderful collection of Birds. Excellent and a nice walk around to see Birds talking and chirping. We also took many photos with the Birds and they are not harmful. Excellent forestry inside for the cold weather and very nice to play with Birds. Nice place.
,,Lovely park,5.0,,"Jurong bird park has been operating for some time and was a really good day and a lovely park, I recommend the train to go around the park, especially in the middle of the day as it can be quite hot, the bird show was good and very entertaining. Some gorgeous birds that I had never seen. If you buy your tickets through the hotel you are staying it, you can get them a bit cheaper."
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,"We had taken a park hopper package for Jurong bird park, Singapore zoo, river safari and night safari that could be utilised in 7 days. Very different kind of birds can be seen here. We saw couple of very nice and unique shows also. One involved predators like vultures and eagles and one involving different birds where they are flying pretty close to you over your head."
,,My all time fav!!,5.0,,"Did the Jurong Bird Park second time, first was a couple of years ago, and imagine doing the whole circuit of 4-5 hours all over again!! The motivation was to show my mother around and nothing better for family bonding than a beautiful picnic place thronging with birds. It would be an understatement to say that there's just about every category of bird in the world. More telling statement would be to say and give full marks to to the beautifully green environs which the park has created and so many nooks and private spaces with beautiful nature all around. A wonderful green world has been created and I bet you can just get lost in the bird-world here. The highlight of this was Lorry's loft where the colorful birds sat on your head, hands...squawking to be fed. The bird show of High Flyers was good, and the tram ride took off our tiredness. The African enclosure was the most beautiful like the lost world."
,,Birds are pityful and cages are small.,2.0,,"I visited with my wife and my sister-in-law. Both of them felt pity towards those birds in the tiny cages.

For me, I feel very sorry for the parrot ""Amigo"", I have seen him singing and serving the park since 2001. Every time I saw him at the amphitheater show and heard him singing with shaky voice, I feel very pity. In addition to that, I saw two Macaws hanging at the cage net and looking outside with very pitiful faces. I can understand that they want freedom. When we saw the egret opening mouth towards the artificial tide and looking for the fish repeatedly, we decided to leave the park.

Anyway, this place is good for local kids to learn about different species of birds. I wish the park management should think about better living condition for the birds."
,,Well laid out,4.0,,"Clean, organised and plenty to see. Set with beautiful gardens and paths and easy for anyone to navigate."
,,are u into bird watching?,5.0,,"Something unique in the entire world with birds from all over the world. Such a huge park with so many varieties of birds , kingfishers , falcons , owls , pelicans , emu, ostrich etc all in one park is a joy for one and all ranging from 1 year old to 90 year olds. The message- dont kill us but love us."
,,nice family day out,5.0,,"Nice place to spend 3-4 hours away from the shopping, especially if with children. several colourful birds and the 2 bird shows at 3 and 4 pm were very nice, with audience participation. It was nice to walk about following a beautiful peacock. There was a free childrens play area too with a nice snack bar around it."
,,Tropical Oasis,4.0,,A lovely selection of birds from various countries in a unique garden setting. Well worth the visit but go early morning or late afternoon to avoid walking a long way in the intense heat
,,One of its kind,5.0,,"Though I am not crazy about watching birds but I was truly impressed by seeing Eagles, Vultures, Kites and Hawks. Also, must watch the snowy owl, reminds me of Harry Potter."
,,Brilliant day - top attraction,5.0,,"For someone like me, an urban dweller from northern Europe, glimpsing a chaffinch in the garden is about as good as it gets so seeing birds as varied and colourful as the ones here is a real experience. This is certainly not just a run of the mill aviary with birds kept in restricted spaces. Due to the scale and size of the park many birds appear as if in their natural environments but the clever layout still allows for some up close viewing. To see all the shows its best to check the times as soon as you get in to avoid missing out. Especially the parrot that sings happy birthday and counts in 3 languages - amazing. If you fly with Singapore Airlines take your boarding pass to earn a 15% admission discount. We were on a cruise and stay holiday and doing this in a day wasn't a problem. A taxi on the meter from the port cost $30 Singapore but 50% less for the return - strange! The metro goes there if time allows."
,,Time pass at Singapore,5.0,,it is a big bird park with all the birds. you can find all kinds of birds of world. Children will be more and more happy visiting this park.
,,Indeed nice place,5.0,,Was in singapore for 3 years. And recently had a chance to visit this place. Wow. It was great. So many birds. And make sure to see the bird show. Have to spend whole day to visit all the places. Have a discount if you use a card issued from singapore bank.
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"Definitely not to be missed. Never seen such a bird park any where. Birds mostly in natural habitats, covering vast area."
,,Simply Amezing,5.0,,"It's Simply amazing very well maintained and huge bird park, can easily take good 4 to 6 hr to visit it. Do remember to check timings of bird shows and watch them. If you are traveling with children then it's a must visit attraction in your Singapore visit."
,,Check the discounts!,5.0,,"Among the 4 Wildlife Reserves of Singapore the Bird Park is my favourite one. Maybe because my 19 months old baby was more interested or maybe because you will be very close to the animals. Whichever the case if you have kids with you I can guarantee you they will love it! Do not miss the birds show (parrots and kings of the sky).

LOCATION
The park is located on the west part of Singapore. To reach it you can take MRT to Boon Lay, subsequently take the interchange bus n. 194 or 251. Easier way? Taxi!

TICKET
The price is a bit high if you buy the ticket directly at the entrance. I suggest you to check the website:
https://m.wrs.com.sg/
you can save up to 30% if you purchase it online.
We booked the ticket 30 minutes before entering in the park and we saved a lot.

If you are considering to visit more than one reserve I suggest you to buy a multi-park ticket. There are 3 different formulas 4-1 (for 4 parks) 3-1 and 2-1. The ticket is valid for 1 week from the first park visit.

SUGGESTION
We did not have enough time to see all the birds because we reached there only at 2:00 pm. It will take long time if you want to visit everything, therefore better start before noon."
,,Well run bird park in Singapore,5.0,,"I have been to a few bird parks around the world and this has to be one of the best that I have been too. I will start by agreeing with other reviewers that this is not the Singapore Zoo, and it's not supposed to be.

The Jurong Bird Park is beautifully maintained and the birds seem to be living very well, and in nice big clean spaces. My favourite space is the Waterfall Aviary and if you are there at 10:30 you can feed the birds including a small species of hornbill.

There is plenty to do for adults without kids, and families alike - thoroughly recommended."
,,Beautifully presented Bird Park,5.0,,"Beautifully presented Bird Park and well worth the trip out of the CBD. The taxi fair from Bugis was under SIN$20.

The park has a lovely collection of birds of all shapes and sizes and colours. Excellent spot for a bit of photography. Well planned, with the option of walking the main loop circuit around the park or taking the tram ($5). We sat through one of the shows, which was interesting enough, but I think the shows are more aimed at children. Apart from the birds, there were quite a few huge lizards roaming freely around the park. An excellent way to spend a morning or afternoon."
,,Lovely Parrots!,5.0,,"First, My son and I looked around Jurong Bird Park by Tram. And then We went Loly Loft and Waterproof by walk. Experience of feeding birds is very fantastic.."
,,Nice place to visit,3.0,,"It was nice to visit the place. Due to excess heat on that day my baby (12 months) didn't enjoy and was a bit cranky. So I could't enjoy much also. Lory Loft was superb. The lakes were excellent. I wish there were sheds all over the roads so that my baby could also enjoy watching the birds :P. I enjoyed the Malaysian bird park more than this one which I visited several years back (may be baby issue, I was a free bird then :P).

It is a day trip. Take your time to visit the place and watch the shows."
,,Excellent Bird Park,5.0,,This bird park is much better than the zoo. The number of bird species are huge and it's nice to see most birds flying freely around. Food is available inside. There are also bird shows and try to catch them. It's great for kids.
,,Lots of bird,4.0,,Very nice bird collection with the dome so that they stay in place. The kids love the place as they can run around and chase some of the birds.
,,very interesting,4.0,,"It's been a long time since I last went to the bird park. Was there on 11 Jan 2015 with some of my family members and my 2 years-old nephew. The bird park is not as big as the zoo, however you can still spend around half a day there to visit all the exhibits comfortably. However, I feel that some of the descriptions of the birds are too little. Would prefer it to be more detailed and educational. The bird park is less crowded than River Safari on a Sunday, based on my previous experience with river safari. Didn't visit all the birds as the little boy was tired and it rained a little."
,,The zoo's better,4.0,,"Unless you love birds more than mammals, the zoo's more varied, so if you can only see one of the two, choose the zoo. Still, a fun interactive experience, the bird park."
,,A grande ode to the feathered friends,5.0,,"I have been to this wonderful bird park in Singapore about four times. Every visit brings in a great memory of the grand collection of birds across the globe.
The park is in a large green setting in Jurong area of Singapore. I have been to many bird places across the globe like in Australia, South Africa, Brazil, London, US & Germany. But Jurong Bird park has one of the best collection of birds. When I visited the park on 21st January 2015, I saw the ""Winged wonders of Asia"" section which was opened on that day. What a delight collection of Asian gems they have. Also, the ""bird of Paradise"" birds in Singapore were more cheerful and visible than the Paradise birds in San Diego zoo."
,,very fun bird park,4.0,,"I like the bird park and river safari most among the four zoos in Singapore. The bird park has a lot of beautiful birds. and very interesting performance show. It is a little bit far, but there are shuttle buses at Jurong MRT which can transfer you from MRT station to the park."
,,"Oh, nothing like it",5.0,,"Beautiful birds, kept beautifully. Avoid the shows, very noisy and boring. Shows good only for the kids."
,,amazing bird show!,4.0,,"A colour display of birds from all over the world, a great way to spend the day! Do watch the bird show where the birds fly all around you and the bird trainers make it an interactive experience."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"I visited this place on a shot day trip . I was so impressed with it I just had to bring my two young boys to look at it. I found birds in there only a mother could love. I have never seen so many different birds. The area where they put on the bird displays was a fun experience. We caught a train there from town which was also great, the trains are so clean.
I recommend getting there early before the crowds, its a good half day plus ."
,,good for children,3.0,,It a good place for children but as a couple if you visit singapore and if u dnt visit here then i would be fien as it does not have much for couples to see
,,When looking up dont open your mouth!!,5.0,,"the birds fly just above your heads and the presenters repeated this advice to us!
Truly the kings of the skies and the other bird show were very very good. the birds flew just above us and the route was such that they flew above almost everyone's heads.
It was the most interactive you could get without actually touching the birds
Takes a full day easily"
,,Nice bird park,4.0,,It is very nice bird park an du ll really love it especially if ur bird lover and enthusiastic too see different kinds of birds in one place.. It is really really mesmerizing to see so many kinds of birds ..
,,Interesting! 😞,3.0,,"We went by public transportation and this was just as interesting as the Bird park. Sometimes it was difficult to sse the birds and this was a little bit disappointing. However, those we did see were fabulous."
,,Nice to watch bird activities during shows,4.0,,"There are 3 shows at Jurong bird park that are worth watching. The way parrots perform is amazing. As the overall area is too big, the tram service helps to cover the complete park without tiring yourself. Feeding penguins with your hands was a great experience."
,,Exotic Birds,4.0,,"Worth a visit if you are a bird lover. Great range of birds to see. Must see the bird show. Tip - allow 2 to 3 hours to see area, good sunhat, sunscreen and a local guide is useful"
,,Must visit for the shows,4.0,,Jurong bird park - has around 2-3 shows and if you intend to travel so far then watching the shows is a must as kids enjoy it. Secondly they have a tram which you can ride on incase you dont want to walk around. Waterfall is nice to click pics. Veg food is avaialble and indian food too. Good to visit with kids once
,,not bad!!,3.0,,A bird show was fresh!! And my parents were satisfied with that!! I remember it was so so.
,,A exotic bird park !!,5.0,,"It was nice to see varities of birds all around the world at a one place , colourfull parrots sit on our hands and we can feed them ,it was a wonderful experience ."
,,gotta go there,5.0,,"If you even like birds a bit, this is an amazing place to spend a few hours. Huge variety of birds and in some enclosures they land on you. I can't recommend this place highly enough. The zoo however isn't worth the money. If you are choosing between zoo and jurong, go to the bird park."
,,Good but...,4.0,,"It is a good bird park if you love birds, we only went as it was part of the 4 in 1 deal with the zoo. It is in need of updating in areas, worth a visit but probably not for us and would not return any time soon. It was enjoyable to see some of the exotic birds they house from around the world and it had a fairly simple, easy to follow route around. We saw the staff cleaning out the enclosures whilst we were there."
,,A Day Out At The Bird park,4.0,,"We recently stayed in Singapore and we decided to have a day out at the Jurong Bird Park, we were very glad we did.
We had a wonderful day out, so much to do and see. Fun for all, adults and children alike.
This is a really good set up, you can see the birds in flight, even feed them at specific times. There are shows to watch as well as just walking around, heat or rain can be a bit of a damper on some days. The bird show is excellent, I have to mention the talking parrot,who counts, sings and talks in both English and Chinese, very clever.
There are birds from all over the world and they also have a variety of breeding programmes for endangered species you can look at.
There are lots of facilities, toilets, cafes and restaurants.
We had a rain storm as we were nearly finishing the tour and we saw an attendant collecting people and taking them to the exit, great service.
I would thoroughly recommend this attraction to anyone who likes birds and bird watching."
,,Good Variety of Birds,3.0,,"Lot of Birds, the location is a bit far off from the city. They could have some bird shows to make things look more attractive."
,,Still the same old bird park,3.0,,"This was the last park we visited using our 3-in-1 park hopper tickets. To get here, we rode the MRT to Boon Lay Station then took Bus 194. I do not remember seeing a directional sign at Jurong Bird Park bus stop but everyone who got off the bus immediately headed to the right so we just went along with them. At the first street corner, turn left, the park’s main entrance could be seen on the right.

Tip: There’s a nice photo spot with the park logo a short distance from the greet staff at the main entrance, just before you reach the turnstiles/ticketing area.

We went directly to Penguin Coast and managed to take good viewing spots as we waited for the 10:30AM feeding. Only a few of the penguins swam after the tossed fish, some would rather approach the park staff and be handfed.

Afterwards we went to Pools Amphitheatre to watch the 11AM High Flyers show. This is very entertaining and if you’re a lucky volunteer, you could be chosen to participate by holding show props like hoops. I remember a similar show I watched here many years ago. I even got identical pics of a macaw flying through a big hoop. Talk about timeless.

We then headed to the World of Darkness where the owls are kept, here flash photography is prohibited.

I was eager to see the Birds of Prey exhibit but was disappointed to see mostly metal bar enclosures. Totally different from what I remember many years ago.

Unlike the Singapore Zoo tram which you can ride unlimited times, here once you get off the tram at the main station, you cannot ride again.

Beware of mosquitoes. We wore shorts to the park as it was such a hot and humid day. My son started complaining of bites as we neared Lory Loft. It definitely put a damper on his park visit. Strangely no one else in our group got bitten.

We had ourselves stamped at the re-entry gate so we could have a late lunch at one of the restaurants out by the ticketing area. We initially went to Bongo Burgers but the food was ridiculously expensive so we settled with Hawk Café.

Later, we re-entered the park to visit The Breeding & Research Centre where we saw the incubation room, the newly hatched chicks in the nursery and lots of young birds in the weaning rooms.

We only stayed 4 1/2 hrs which was just as well because it rained heavily soon after we left."
,,Good experience,3.0,,"We visited with our 2 yr old child just before the penguins were fed.. Took the tram ride through the whole park, it was so peaceful.. After the tram ride we got to see the bird show which was really impressive.. But must say it's just a one time visit kinda place...
Cons are that they charge too much for everything .. Like pics with the birds was starting from $35 .... The food was nice in BONGO BURGERS but overpriced.. Overall a nice evening spent
And we got a cab real quick while coming back to hotel"
,,Bird Fanciers Paradise,5.0,,"Great setup although the heat can be a bit much. the birds are superb covering species from around the globe and the park is having success in breeding programs for some endangered species as well. The bird show is a highlight especially the talking parrot who talks, sings and counts in english and Chinese."
,,Fun and informative!,4.0,,"Jurong bird park is a fun experience not only for children but for adults too! You learn a lot about the animals, get to feed them on specific feeding times and also watch quite a few shows that take place throughout the day (the high flyers show is particularly fun!). There are beautiful tucans, colourful parrots, owls, penguins, flamingos and all other sorts of birds. We got caught up in the rain later in the afternoon and a member of staff picked us up with a golf cart to take us to the exit. I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 because I think the penguins could use a bit more space. Other than that, lots of fun!"
,,just amazing...,4.0,,"a place where one can find all kind of birds and what can be better then show put up by the care taker of the zoo... they have all kind of facilities like restaurant, cart for the visitors...."
,,Place you can really enjoy,5.0,,"Exhibition starts with variation of penguins people cannot leave, good performance of trained birds, colourful toucans, parrots will eat from your hands and seat at your shoulders. Gold jewellery is very attractive for them."
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,Jurong bird park and night safari can be combined in a day. Jurong bird park can be easily reached by taking MRT and then a bus. Friendly staff at bird park . Photography with birds is one of the highlights of the park. Family with kids will enjoy this place more.
,,"Colorful, Interactive (many shows), Informative ( Facts normally you wont know)",5.0,,"Our kids loved the visit to Bird Park, one should try and enjoy the feeding sessions to birds , bird park got many such shows during the day at different times , if you get there early - you can plan it. We were not in a hurry as we were not travelling in a big group - we could spare lot of time to stop by where we liked - we enjoyed Horn Bill Chit Chat, having photo op with parrots , photos with pink Flemingos to name a few. Kids loved the ropeway and were thrilled to see so many birds in one place...They also learn the importance of conservation and saving these beautiful species in the process which is great!
Tips : Either buy combined tickets of Bird Park, ZOO and River Safari Or/And buy online to save some money and time (in Queue) - you could save 5% to 20% on tickets depending on what you select."
,,Beautiful park,4.0,,"Went on organised tour of the park. Takes a little while to travel out to park, but well worth it. The gardens are quite beautiful, and the bird shows were very good to watch. The tram ride was nice, and you could hop on and hop off as you wanted. We were fortunate that it was very quiet as thunderstorms had occurred earlier in the afternoon, but cleared by the time we got there. I would recommend a visit to the park, but maybe not on a tour, as we felt it was a little rushed. We would have liked to have walked a few more of the paths, but ran out of time. Not sure if it would have been as good if it was busy though."
,,Must visit tourist places in Singapore,5.0,,"Very well planned Bird park, the sheer number of birds and diversity in species is impressive. The birds look quite healthy and well looked after. The birds of prey show is a nice attraction in the park. There is a small train that runs through the park for people who cannot walk around the whole park. it is therefore convenient for aged/disabled people.
There is also a huge canopy on top of which one can walk along a walkway and birds can roam in this area quite freely.
I have been here twice and I plan to visit it once again."
,,Good to see,4.0,,Its a must specially when you have young kids with. The prices could be less than now. Probably its normal for japanese and rich indians who were the most of the visitors
,,Worth a Visit,3.0,,Good park with lot of different kind of birds and shows. Man made waterfall is also good for taking pics. You can take lot of pictures over here. Worth a Visit!!
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Very colorful birds everywhere. Paradise for a photographer with a good zoom lens. Don't miss the shows btw.
,,Great shows,4.0,,"We went here with our young son since he enjoy's birds and had a very enjoyable outing. Due to the heat in Singapore i would recommend visiting in the morning before it get to hot. The shows were great and I would highly recommend attending, with the first one staring at 10.00. Like the zoo you are able to hire buggy's and wagons for kids if you don't want to bring your own. Like the zoo it is cheaper to purchase tickets online before arriving."
,,Great place that's why it cost you a lot,4.0,,It is a nice place to visit with family. but the ticket fee for foreigner is twice more expensive that singaporean.
,,Unique experiance,4.0,,"I have never been a lover of Zoos etc however the Jurong Bird park experience was very refreshing and unique. Most of the birds are in the open so it gives a sense of not being in captivity ( a big relief !!). The Flamingos, Parakeets were beautiful and the sheer range of colours was a totally unbelievable.. The ride to/from cbd is a combination of the metro + the bus but its totally convenient and well synchronized..Surely worth it for bird lovers..."
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,This is a nice park. If you enjoy bird watching this is a must see place. The park has a nice layout so its easy to walk around. They have an impressive collection of bird species and fun shows. I would pick this place over the zoo.
,,Good shows,5.0,,"The High Flyer and King of Hunter shows are fantastic, but for me it is too short, but for the kids it is a very amazing show. Need to involve more visitors in the shows, since the visitor number is a lot."
,,"Totally enjoyed the place, worth going",5.0,,"Enjoyed the birdshows very much, birds are very well trained and taken care of. My daughter enjoyed the performance very much. We went to the buffet lunch with parrot performance for $22 per person and is very worth it. A great display of penguins, flamingos and owls."
,,Easy place to spend half a day with kids,4.0,,"Very well organised bird attraction! Everything is clean and convenient. Love the parrots exhibits and the great highlight was the Lory Loft where you get to feed the lories with nectar. Pretty well-shaded with trees throughout the park. Lots of rest areas. There's a children's playground that has water features - bring extra set of clothes for your kids if you intend to let them have fun and get wet. There's a hatchery which we missed. Will go there again. For foreign tourist intending to visit the Singapore Zoo or Night Safari or the River Safari together with Bird Park, should consider the package deal which is cheaper when bought in combination. The souvenir photograph is not very cheap at $35 per piece - but hey, that's a tourist attraction."
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,A great place to visit. It was a blast going around the place and seeing all the different birds. Can't wait for it to be moved near the zoo
,,Breathtaking Hornbills and Scarlet Ibis,4.0,,"If you love birds, this is a must. The exhibits are up close and personal and the park is engaging and fun for kids and adults alike. Wonderful and colourful birds from around the world."
,,Make sure to allow plenty of time.,5.0,,"We made a mistake arriving later in the afternoon, when we walked into an entertaining show starring various birds of prey and their trainers. Loved the skywalks and sociable inhabitants of the Lory Loft but didn't have time for the huge African Waterfall Aviary. Took the 5 minute bus ride back to the Jurong East terminal, where we paused for coffee in the adjoining mall, then rode the MRT back to the city."
,,Great day spent,5.0,,Grat day for the family. It's woth buying the combo ticket. Zoo+night safari+ birds park. Loved the birds show. They were great.
,,Great Bird Park.,5.0,,"We visited Jurong Bird park on 23 December 2014, Jurong Bird Park is a 20.2 hectare open-concept park. It is the largest in the Asia Pacific and the best in the world. Its collection of more than 9,000 birds from 600 species is among the largest in the world. The Park specialises in birds from South Asia.

The Park has four aviaries, among which is the world’s largest walk-in aviary with the tallest man-made waterfall for visitors to enjoy a close-up view of free-flying birds from Africa and South American Birds, staged at the Pool Amphitheatre and Fuji Hawk.

First we had witnessed the Bird Show at the Amphitheater at 3:00 p.m, later we took at Tram Ride to go around, also visited man made Water falls also we had witnessed another great show at 4:00 p.m with vultures.

Overall we had a great time at Bird Park."
,,Highly recommended,4.0,,"I didn't expect a bird park can be so much fun. The park was very well planned and I have to say the show is really really good. We went with mum and dad and the four of us really enjoyed it! It was fun and informative. The audience can interact with the birds and I think it was fantastic. All the birds are so beautiful. If possible, maybe should take the tram first for a loop then decided which area you want to go."
,,Great place to visit with Kids,5.0,,One of the must to visit place in Singapore. Kids will enjoy the most. Need to keep one day for the visit and the shows are must to watch.
,,No regrets,5.0,,"This was the only tour that my husband requested we did. We all loved it. We also pre booked the lunch with the birds. It was so worth the bill. My kids experienced handling the macaw. We had lots of photos taken. The attendants are so accomodating. The som can talk for hours and the patiently chatted with him about all his bird questions. Couldn't get enough of the place. Given the chance to, we'll be back. If you like birds, I highly recommend it."
,,Educational for children,4.0,,"This is an excellent attraction for all ages, especially children. Too big to cover in a day for youngsters but of great educational interest. Trains take you to whichever area you want and back to food area and exits. Can get quite busy at times but a pool and water area allows all to cool off .
The attractions are well set up, clean and large. You can get quite near to some birds including touching them. A good day out."
,,Better than Expected,4.0,,Thought we would only be spending a few hours there. We were wrong! Spend the day and explore all the bird enclosures. The bird encounters and shows are great fun for everyone not just children.
,,Nice day out,5.0,,Must visit if you love birds - very well maintained and well connected internally. One can spend the whole day going around and seeing these amazing creatures
,,One of the best places in Singapore- MUST VISIT!,5.0,,"I visited this place on a family trip to Singapore and i have to say it is one of the most amazing attraction in Singapore. They have variety of birds. There were huge flocks of pelicans, flamingoes, swans in open. The cages were pretty big, clean and they have tried to replicate fauna and flora of home-land of the birds. Waterfall aviary and jungle jewel areas were most enjoyable as there were a large number of bird species,all in open-you could go in that enclosure and experience birds flying all around you.!! Hornbills and Toucans and parrot paradise had some beautiful big exotic birds. A must visit on your trip to Singapore."
,,Rain Ruined It,3.0,,"It was raining a lot (around Christmas) on the day I visited with my family. It was a big disappointment as we could hardly see the birds and most of the shows were either cancelled or significantly shortened.

I had no choice to defer my visit as I had already bought the four attraction combo ticket at the start of my trip and was leaving Singapore early next day."
,,Best of the Singapore zoos,5.0,,"What a fantastic day out!! The birds were spectacular, healthy and seemed happy, particularly all those not in cages (wetlands, riverina, flamingos, pelicans etc). The zoo must be doing something right if the birds are staying put.
Most enclosures were good size, clean and brilliantly designed with foliage etc. only down side was the birds of prey and night birds. Those cages were horribly small and need updating.
Waterfall Avery was great and full of beautiful birds. Feeding time was fun, particularly when things got interactive. Will recommend this park to others and go back next visit to Singapore."
,,Definitely worth it,4.0,,The birds shows are very enjoyable for kids and adults alike. Will make a bird watcher out of anyone.
,,Great day for the family,4.0,,So many birds. Well maintained and huge diversity. The walk in aviary with the parrots was the most fun as one can interact with the birds while feeding them
,,Brilliant and eye opening,5.0,,I am not much of a bird lover at the best of time but went on the advice of a friends mother. BEST DAY EVER!!!!!! I cannot recommend the waterfall enclosure feeding highly enough and the Buffett with the birds. Both made the day amazing especially since both were audience interactive
,,Good Park,3.0,,"The Bird park is good but located in the out skirt of the city, The Bird show is good and its has a man made water park."
,,Birds and the bees,4.0,,"My friends and I bought a Park hopper ticket which includes Jurong Bird Park, we went to the park the day when we first arrived at Singapore, since it is far compared to the other destinations in our list. It is simply living it's name, if you are a nature lover you shouldn't miss this park, what we enjoy the most are the shows and staring at the penguins and the sleeping polar bear, and aside form different species of birds you can also encounter some bees."
,,Great for kids,4.0,,"The park is a great attraction for kids and bird lovers.. they have various sections and even an artificial waterfall. Flamencos, penguins, you name it they have it.. a really fun place for kids and families."
,,"good place but you can skip, not a must visit",4.0,,"we did go to the bird park. but it was raining in nov when we went. dont go if the weather is bad..its no point. its worth it, as there are variety of birds which you may have never heard or seen. Also there are many shows inside the park at dfferent timings. so make sure you plan and be at that spot to enjoy. More fun with kids around.

If you have time and the money you can visit this place."
,,Colourful,4.0,,"Good experience, can go through the full park in just 4 hrs mot much food stalls inside so carry on food and water"
,,Christmas visit..,5.0,,"Its warm so ensure you wear shorts and Tees .. however it can rain sometimes, umbrella will help. Very exclusive birds, you get to see them and not hidden. The Penguins, look astoundingly good. Very happy to be there with my kids .."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"A lovely place. MUST VISIT. The best collection of birds. Great facilities. Take the tram and you dont need to walk much then. Waterfall aviary, And jewels of the forest are the best . Dont miss the lorry loft."
,,All in the Package....,5.0,,"We visited the place in a package given by the organizer and was worth the visit. Nothing much to say, well maintained but the good one there was the opportunity to have the birds on your hands and my wife has a PIC so I can prove."
,,An ok experience,3.0,,"Unless you are a major bird lover, the bird park won't hold your attention for long.

The facility is pretty good, very family friendly and we had no problems with a buggy, but it's just missing a certain something I can't put my finger on...it's no Night Safari, that's for sure."
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,Brilliant ecological maintenance. A totally different experience to watch and enjoy birds. What a colourful population. A must for Singapore visitors.
,,Enjoy with birds,5.0,,"There are very specific variety of birds which you dont get to see in India and many of the birds are kept in open, so you get a chance to walk with the birds an also play around. This was the best thing i liked about it.
It requires atleast 4-5 hours to cover the entire area and do not miss shows which happen across the day."
,,Below Expectations,3.0,,"This is a very well publicized place. The park does have a collection of birds of various species, there are shows etc, but much more was expected as per the publicities. Many enclosures had the same species of birds, the nocturnal section was so dark that it is difficult even to walk around. Directions also should be much clear to walk around."
,,A very nice place to spend a day,5.0,,We came there very early and was able to catch the first show they had lined up. All shows are actually fun. The birds are all so attractive and the whole place is very well maintained. Recommended for children
,,Great day out,5.0,,"So many different birds from lots of habitats, not something I'd normally like but has lots of interesting species."
,,Second Visit and We'll Go Again,5.0,,"My husband loves birds, so even though we had been to Jurong Bird Park in Feburary 2014, we found ourselves driving out to the Bird Park once more in December.

Whilst it is beyond us to walk any type of distance, we manages to see the birds we wanted to see, by using the little car type train that is available and just got off at the various train stations, have a look around then get back on the train.

Lots of wonderful seating around the park which is essential for us both and in lovely shady areas.

The shows that are offered are excellent and free with the highlight being the Birds of Prey show.

Facilities are clean and food is available and very good.

Lovely day for singles, couples or families.

We caught a cab and the price was still very reasonable and allowed us to see some of Singapore outside of the CBD area which was an added bonus."
,,Good for young kids,4.0,,"We have been here 4 or 4 times now but it's still a popular outing for our daughter. There is a special offer at the moment where you get an annual pass for $28 per adult and $18 per child, so if you can manage it a few times then it represents decent value for money."
,,Birds in Captivity,2.0,,"our trip to Jurong Bird Park started from City Hall MRT. Upon arrival at Boon xxx MRT we saw no obvious information on how to reach the Park. Information along the way on how to reach the Bird Park is not obviously displayed. Non-English speaking visitors would have problems. Upon stepping off the bus at the Park there is no information as to the park location. It is very close by, but again, there is no welcoming information. A walk from the bus stop to the Park entrance on a rainy day would 'dampen' the spirits of many visitors. Too many birds are imprisoned in cages that are protected with a wire mesh that also prevents the visitors from photographing the 'inmates'. Birds SHOULD NOT be kept in such enclosures. The three 'attractions' that justify some reason for holding birds in captivity are: the penguin/flamingo area, the walk-in aviary and the 'bird show', which was very entertaining and offered some educational value to advanced English language speakers. One 'bird' you should avoid is the 'Chicken Biriyani' in the restaurants close to the entrance. It was disgusting! A visit to Jurong Bird Park should be low in your places to see."
,,Good for family,4.0,,We brought our baby and my in laws to Jurong Bird Park this afternoon. We managed to catch the shows and it was highly entertaining. Quite easy to move around the park with our baby.
,,I wish to fly like those birds,5.0,,The experience was thrilling and if you do go just visit across all the places as many places are such that you can have easy bird feeding encounters were you get to see them at close quarters.
,,Paradise for bird lovers,4.0,,"loved the birds and the way that the ""most"" enclosures were built is impressive. getting to feed the birds was super cool....lot of programs were missing but it was worth every penny. I needed 2 days to finish the park, because we took pictures of most of the birds and son had a gala time in the play ground"
,,Good time for all,4.0,,"My wife and I initially thought it would be worthwhile only for children bit we were proved wrong. The bird park as a whole isn't very big if you just walk past looking at the birds or take the mini train around the part. Take your time reading about each of the species and then it would easily take you about 2~3 hours. But that isn't the major attraction. It is the bird shows by far. They are really good. The birds are trained so well, it is as if they are telepathically connected to the trainer. Try to catch at least 2 shows according to the timings on their website or pamphlets."
,,Many types of birds,3.0,,In jurong bird park you all will find thousands of birds breaded in there natural condition by the entry of park you all will here only the voices of birds. In the first time of my life i saw a white piccork with opened feather so good to see that view dont miss to go here best place but the things are bit shabby and toilets are not available thought the parkss
,,Asia's Largest Bird Paradise,4.0,,"It was a fine Tuesday, 16.12.2014, when we reached the Bird Park at 10.15am. We decided to take the tram ride round the Park before exploring future.
From the Main Station, we bypass the Heliconia Walk where the Collared , white-Breasted, Black-backed KingFishers were located. There were also the Scarlet Ibis, Straw-Necked Ibis along with the Red-crested and Buffon's Toucans and the African Grey Hornbills, Crowned Hornbills, etc were resting in the large cages.
Upon the second Lory Station, you could see the Lory Loft with a 9th Storey high enclosure that offers a view of lush greenery and the friendly eating right in front of your eyes. Lories and Lorikeets like the Blue-Streaked and Black- Capped Lories, Dusky, Rainbow and Yellow-bibbed Lories. After the rides later, we explore Birds of Preys like the African Fish
Eagle, White-Bellied Sea Eagle and the Changable Hawk- Eagle etc...
then comes the Biggest and Tallest Ostrich, Rhea, Cassowary and the Emu...
At the 3rd waterfall Station, where the Waterfall aviary were located, the 30-metre high waterfall with over 600 free- flying birds getting up and close to you.
Visitors could take their times admiring the waterfall and beautiful birds after the tram rides.
Finally before going back to the Main Station, the Parrot Paradise like the Kakapo,Bibi, Niap Niap Cockatoo; the Pelican Cove and Flamingo Lake were just right before us.
After alighting from the tram, we will explore the Park by walking slowing and watching all the beautiful birds right from the start.
of course, along the way, we stopped at different dining places for some light meals like the Hawk Cafe, Lory Loft Cafe whereby pastries, sandwiches, pastas and drinks were sold.
Catch the High Flyers Show at the Pools Amphitheatre where star birds performing a free- flying show takes place.
Some visiting tips for visitors :-
Be sun safe, bring along your hats and caps. It also protects your heads as the birds are free flying just above your heads.
Bring along your rain coat in case as the Park are too open, and insect repellent is a must, as the Park may attracts insects here and there.
Wear comfortable footwear and clothing as you need at least half a day to clear the Park compound.
Rest and stay hydrated while exploring the Bird Park, especially when you travelled along with families of elderly and young kids.
Well, you will love the Bird Park if you are a birds' lover.
Enjoy."
,,Very nice,4.0,,"If you want to spend time there, take a whole day to enjoy the bird shows and nature. I stayed only for a while. Take the free train ride."
,,Bird Sanctuary,4.0,,"We visit this place at least twice a month for the last few months, as we have a family membership card. It's good to make our money worth. Like most attractions in Singapore, the park's entrance fee is expensive. So it's good if you make your money worth by spending at least half a day here. Go when the park has just opened in the morning, around 9am so that it will not be too crowded.

The first stop should be the penguin's enclosure. I noticed that they are the most active in the morning. You can count yourself lucky if it's feeding time. You get to see the penguins swimming up close through the glass enclosure. Make sure you don't miss the bird shows. Starts as early as 10.30am but better check the daily schedule if you don't want to miss any of the shows.

Other than the penguins, try not to miss the Lory Loft. The Australian birds are not shy and will fly close to you especially when you bring along their feeds. You can purchase the feeds at the enclosure itself. Another enclosure you should go to is the owls'.

If you have young children, you may want to bring along your swimming costumes cos there is a water playground with slides and all for the children to enjoy.

There are a few eateries that you can go too while you are at the park. But of course, it's pricey compared to the ones you find elsewhere. If you are on a budget, just pack some sandwiches and bring along your own drinks.

Don't expect the staff to be as warm and friendly like those that you may have experienced elsewhere. Many are part-time staff who needs to be trained to improve on their service.

Nevertheless, still a great place to experience the sights and sounds of nature in urbanized Singapore."
,,A Lovely and Colourful Bird Park,2.0,,"A must visit Bird Park as it offers you great varieties of birds that are taken care of by the Park very well.

The orangy and pink Pelicans are a wonderful sight and it brings a great smile when you see them.

All categories of birds are classified in separate cages.

My most favourite is the 5th level whereby the birds at the Lory Loft is presented with a net above as they are let loose and for a fee of S$2 you can purchase a honey syrup cup whereby you are allowed to feed the birds and it is a great photoshoot.

Watch out for their performing times as the raptors will be flying above you from the command of their trainers. Awesome!"
,,Falconer's Day - what a treat!,4.0,,"While visiting a bird park is fun, I added in the Falconer's Day option, and it was such a treat. To stand with, hold, stroke, and witness close up the flight and actions of this magnificent range of birds is delightful. Definitely a must do, if you have the time and extra cash available!"
,,good,5.0,,walking around the park is a good experience watching birds up close . loved the organized passage and the viewers area.
,,You've got nothing to lose,3.0,,"Basically is a clean sanctuary to keep all birds.
Lory Loft is the best (highest) place in the park where you can meet those friendly parrots.
Chill out and et a panoramic view of the penguins can be relaxing too.
Not as smelly but some places (birds) are noisy (by nature).
Unless you are birds lovers, you've got nothing to lose."
,,Well worth the visit to the West,4.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is an excellent 1/2 day experience that the whole family should enjoy. The gardens are well kept and lush, and the wildlife is up close and personal. Feeding the Lorikeets in the tree top experience is great for the kids and a good photo opportunity. The penguin feeding is also a highlight. You can do the park on a budget and comfortably get around in 4 hours, which is enough in the Singapore humidity."
,,1000 of Birds Beauty,5.0,,wow wow i enjoyed lot with beautiful birds even i didnt see in india and PARROTS AND QUIL are more number of types can see. PIEGEON are different type with colors is available.
,,'A must visit',5.0,,"Lovely colorful birds at Jurong. Even if you are not a bird lover, you are surely going to enjoy the place. For kids this is a must visit. The shows at Jurong are very well organized and very enjoyable. The show by the macaws are in particular very interesting!"
,,Wonderful birds,5.0,,Beautiful park and wonderful birds. The park is a real thrill and the birds are all wonderful. The penguins are in a brilliant pool and the waterfall is very impressive.
,,Birdy birdy,5.0,,one of the best bird park in the world. Ample amount of bird species are there and few shows which are must attend type. Don't miss it. If you are not a bird lover im sure you gona love it but thats for sure your kids gona love it definitely.
,,Love this place!,5.0,,"Wish to come back here again. There were lots of birds of different kinds. Rode the tram but decided to walk around and indeed, we had a better view and enjoyed watching the birds.Stress reliever. They had a promo of 1 year free entrance...Could stay here for hours."
,,Don't miss these pretty birds,5.0,,"Most of the tour operators will not include this in itinerary, but make it a point to go there. We stayed extra days to visit Jurong ! And believe me, you wont be disappointed. So may species, so many colours... Park is well maintained. Yes, you will have to walk quite a bit. Take a monorail to have a bird's eye view. Then have a detail tour. Enjoy with nature !!"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"I will preface this review saying that my wife has worked at a bird of prey sanctuary in the UK for a number of years and is massively into animal welfare, especially with birds, and this place gets a thumbs up from her, which is saying something.

All of it was great, but the Lori Loft and the Waterfall Aviary (which is huge, does not feel like and Aviary at all) are really special.

The bird displays were excellent, I do not want to spoil it for anyone, but I have seen some great shows but these were really well done.

It's Singapore, so it's not cheap, but what do you do? It really is very good."
,,Definitely birds paradise..,4.0,,"The facility is world class, with great landscapes, well organised display and aviaries..
The birds aviaries are fantastic, giving real feel of their natural environment... don't miss the bird shows and feeding session, planning your tour accordingly..
Interested in Hornbills and parrots, this is the place .. many species"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Loved the place. The staff really care for the nature conservation. Loved the way they had organized everything. All the shows are a must-watch. I didnt feel that the tram ride is a must unless you are too tired or too old. Even when you take a tram ride, you have to walk inside to see the animals."
,,Don`t miss it,5.0,,"Beautiful park with lots of birds and amazing orchids. Really a must to visit in Singapore.
Bit out of the city , take a taxi, which is ~30 minutes drive.

Park entrance is amazing. Don`t miss to take a photo of the orchids.
From 10:30 there is a penguin feeding show, and from 11:00 the birds show, which is absolutely amazing and a MUST to see.

You can walk around the park or take the small locomotive, which is going around the park too."
,,One of the best bird park in the region.,5.0,,This is one of the best bird park in the region. It is like walking in a large natural habitat with accessible size of area. Splendid place for family with young one or wheelchair bound parents; as well as a great place for couples or visiting friends.
,,Very Enjoyable Day Out,5.0,,Took our grandson for a day out at the Bird Park. We were lucky to catch 3 different shows. Absolutely fantastic and interesting. Amazing how smart the Birds are. One can easily spend the whole day watching exquisite and rare birds and I would encourage any one visiting Singapore to include a visit to the Bird Park.
,,Smart birdies!,5.0,,Start off with the bird show where well trained birds are able to parade back and forth on stage to welcome you. Smart talking birds and also a large array of different species.
,,Fantastic place,5.0,,"Great place for kids...up close and personal with birds,...show timings are till 11 or after 3 so plan your trip accordingly.....morning 9 onwards is better to visit the place...."
,,The early bird...,4.0,,"I went to the park dragging my reluctant 10 year old son. We had to catch three trains and a bus to get out to the park. The first show started at 10 and unfortunately we missed the beginning of this as we had to wait a while for the bus at Boon Lay interchange. This is one of the few places that opens very early so would be great for those early birds or those affected by jet lag. The repeat of the show is only on at 4 pm so if you miss the first, too bad. We then had time to check out the penguin feeding and walk around the heliconia trail before watching the next show. This was very enjoyable especially as my son got chosen to participate. I paid for the tram and used it but really you could do the park all on foot as long as you don't mind walking. It's not as big as the zoo. Some of the aviaries are fantastic like the waterfall aviary and the lorry loft but I didn't like the birds of paradise display. Such small cages. Also the birds of prey cages seemed bare and restrictive. It took us about 3 hours to see all the birds and then my my son had a play at the waterpark. Don't forget your swimmers. Unfortunately there is no seating in the shade to watch the children play. We caught the 194 bus back to Boon Lay from the same stop as it does a circuit. As we were leaving I saw that there was a prawn fishing place right next door to the bird park which would have been fun to try."
,,Beautiful bird park,5.0,,"Very interesting park. The pelican cove, swan lake and flamingo exhibits were impressive. This park is more compact than the Singapore Zoo. We took the tram to get from point to point and were able to view all the exhibits in about two hours. Highly recommended!"
,,Lovely location for great display of birds,5.0,,"The park has been open since 1971, so the trees have grown large, making a splendid background for the aviaries.
We found some small cages disappointing, and smaller than we judge nice for the birds; plus the wire mesh made it difficult to see the occupants. However the larger aviaries were great, and we loved walking through them, giving us superb views of the birds. The 2 shows made a refreshing change of pace.
In particular we enjoyed the birds of paradise, the hornbills and feeding the lories (one wasn't interested in the [expensive] nectar, but spent 10 minutes on my collar chewing my hair, then deafening me when he screeched to his friends.) We also saw a wild iguana, about 2m long in the park.
We went on a damp day, with light rain until about 3pm, this meant it was very quiet, in addition it was a lot cooler - we always try to visit when it's wet. Note that they cancel the shows if it rains, we were lucky they didn't cancel them, but they said the rain did disturb the birds, so some birds didn't do their full display.
Now for the practical points.
Quickest, but most expensive, way to the park is taxi.
Otherwise take the MRT to Boon Lay, then bus 194 which is an express to the park. Bus 251 also goes to the park, but will take a lot longer. Making life easy, you get on the 194 at the arrival stop when you leave the park.
Do bring insect repellant. If you forget, the park shop sells it, but it comes as patches and is rather expensive.
Toilets were available in many locations around the park. They were all extremely clean.
We ate lunch at the Bongo Burger Bar. Overall the meal was fine. We had fish and chips and thank them for giving us some salad which isn't normally included. However the flavour of the fish was disappointing, although everything else in the meal was very tasty.
We sat outside to eat, it was very hot without any fans. I suspect the outside tables would be useless on sunny days.
We were irritated that we were forced to buy cold drinks in unwanted souvenir mugs, which were promptly thrown away! We had just watched a show where we were urged to reduce waste, so it seems daft that the same people then demonstrate a commitment to increasing waste.
Despite that remark, we do think this is a great, world class attraction. If you're interested in birds, don't miss it."
,,Bird Paradise,5.0,,"really had a great time here, didn't think there were so many exotic birds kept captive or native to this island. anyway the bird cage were all excellently maintained. and staff are extremely attentive. One gets to enjoy being close to the the birds of paradise and many are rare and protected"
,,excellent,4.0,,"Definitely one for bird lovers only! Having kept birds ourselves we wanted to check this park out and were amazed by all the different species on show. We got there very early and were bitten alive by mozzies so go prepared or buy repellent from the entrance shop. Loved the shows, good half day out"
,,paradise,5.0,,"The huge nunber of different types of birds is incredible , especially the tropical parrots , reccomended"
,,Beautiful Place,4.0,,"It's a beautiful place to visit in Singapore. It's good to take a walk inside the park rather than the tram ride. You can see the entire park by walk in 3 hours.

The food and drinks are costlier at the Birds park. Better to bring snacks and have lunch before visiting the park.

Click below for some photos:

,,Great bird experience,4.0,,"I went on a Saturday morning to avoid the big crowds. Beautiful birds everywhere. In some areas they fly freely around you under a huge dome net, which is rather nice instead of seeing them in cages. There are varieties of birds from all over the world which is a fantastic experience. There are also lemurs walking around. I'll definitely return."
,,Great for travelling with kids,4.0,,"visited in December 2013, great shows and fun for our 3yr old. It was raining so we did not go to the water feature area (and we didnt bring our swimming togs). Not many people in the afternoon so a very pleasant visit.

We missed some of the feeding sessions and one of the shows. Its a big park so expect some walking. And better schedule your visit.

Maintenance in some areas are needed hence the 4 stars"
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"Overall enjoyed my visit, the park is well laid out with several interactive shows to see and to engage with birds. The staff are very helpful and friendly! The variety & selection of birds is outstanding though on the negative side two key exhibits were closed for maintenance and several visitors were not happy about this and you are not informed of this at the entrance or prior to purchasing your ticket.

It is a good walk and I liked the way the park is structured into sections. You can easily spend a solid 4 to 5 hrs in the park at a relaxed pace. It is also geared toward all family members."
,,Still a good day,5.0,,The Jurong Bird Park is looking a bit worn after its many years of operation but is still a must for bird fanciers and those who just want to spend time in beautiful gardens with birds as the added attraction. The live amphitheatre shows are fantastic and demonstrate the natural abilities of some of the exhibits in a way that is entertaining to the humans but not demeaning to the birds. The 'Kings of the Sky Show' with its free flying birds of prey is the highlight of the day and not to be missed.
,,Good experience,4.0,,There are variety of beautiful birds here divided in various zone...also there are bird shows at pre set time..make sure to attend them too. It is worth watching them. Weather is hot so lots of water is required. A tram is also available for the tour if one doesnt prefer to walk around.
,,Great for Kids!,4.0,,"Brilliant place to go with your children... fascinating birds and animals. There is a water place, so bring your swim suits and extra clothes!

Love the owls exhibit and the seeing the eagles is so majestic.

But can be tiring for the kids, and when weather is hot... Bring lots of water. The food and drinks there are expensive."
,,Great for Bird lovers,4.0,,"Bird lovers and kids I'll really enjoy the bird park, there are plants of opportunities to interact and touch the birds and several entertaining bird shows. Allow about 4 hours to see the park properly and enjoy some lunch there."
,,Out of the world experience,5.0,,"Variety of birds are visible. Don't miss bird shows held at pre determined time. Once you enter, ask for timimng and make yourselgf available. The birds fly just over you. so don't get surprised."
,,Simply awesome experience,5.0,,"After hearing a lot about this place, as one of the best Bird Parks in the world, I was curious to visit it.
Whatever I read about this park does not do it justice. Jurong Bird Park is just AWESOME.
Among some of the must see attractions are the 'Lory Loft', African Waterfall, the flamingoes, etc."
,,Natures Paradise,4.0,,A great collection of exotic birds from all over. A nice day to spend with family and kids. Easy assissible by Bus and MRT. Do not forget to carry your camera. A must see for
,,Good for kids visit,5.0,,Big place and various type of birds can found inside. A waterland area was fun for cooling down with kids around. Wait more than half an hours for taxi back to Hotel after bird park closed
,,Beautiful worth the trip,5.0,,"Loved the park it's so very pretty the birds and surroundings.
Shame the rain stopped us from enjoying much of the day! We were soaked and over it half way round so didn't get to enjoy everything, such a shame as we were so looking forward to it!"
,,Feed the birds!,4.0,,"Last we went, there were some minor renovations going on. And best not to go during december as it is the rainy season. Interesting range of tropical birds. Loved the owl exhibition and the fact that you are able to feed the birds at a price of SG$2. You can take the public transport, just look at their website. Food wise, not many halal choice. There's a terrace kiosk with Indian vegetarian options like briyani so you might want to pack your own food or buy outside before coming in. There is also a waterfall aviary where it's nice to take photos of. Best to come in early where you also get the chance to see the keeper feeding the cute birdies.

Wear your comfortable outfit and shoes and use insect repellant if need to. Tickets wise, you may want to purchase online as they have some cheaper offers at times. Also, it's much cheaper if you are buying multi parks such as bird park and singapore zoo. There's different combo of buying so just check through their website."
,,"Must-see for bird lovers, nature lovers, and great for families",5.0,,"This a must for the bird lover passing through Singapore. The variety of birds is incredible. Singapore is hot and humid and for those who prefer to ride rather than walk, the bird park offers a hop-on-hop-off shuttle for touring the park. But it would be a shame to just jump aboard the shuttle and never get off to take a closer look. The aviaries are a joy and exceptionally large—one even contains a 30-metre-high waterfall. Birds in the aviary can be easily photographed flying, walking, preening, perched at feeding stations and nests.

My husband and I took the shuttle up to the first stop near the Lory Loft (there are two stops along the way) and then made our way back down to the start again, first spending a long while at the Toucan and Hornbill enclosures before looking at Birds of Paradise, Royal Crested Pigeons, and Scarlet Ibises. We've seen Toucans in the wild in Brazil and Hornbills in the wild in both Borneo and South Africa, but it was just as much a treat to see them so closely here.

We then boarded the shuttle again, taking the roundtrip circuit without stops for an overview. We then rode it for a third time, getting off at the second stop, Waterfall Station. We viewed Eagles and Vultures, Ostriches, Cassowary, Emus, South American birds in the Jungle Jewels Flight Aviary, Pelicans and Storks in the Pelican Cove, before finishing off at the Waterfall Aviary for the 2:30 p.m. feeding.

I highly recommend the bird feeding sessions. We attended two, the ""Chit-Chat"" at the toucan and hornbill enclosure, where we learned about the Oriental Pied Hornbill native to Singapore; the second at the Waterfall Aviary, where everyone had a chance to feed a cup of mealy worms to the feathered residents, such as Superb Starlings, Crowned Crested Pigeons, Von der Decken Hornbills, and more.

It was enthralling to see the abundance of pink flamingos at the flamingo ponds, but sad to see an especially pale one with a tumor on its face all by him/herself in the corner. While the others feasted, it just stood there watching. I don't understand why the vets don't just remove its tumor.

The bird park is easy to get to by public transit. Just catch the MRT (metro) to Boon Lay Station and then connect to one of two buses that go directly to the bird park. It probably took us 45 minutes to an hour to get here from Dhoby Ghaut station. Plan on spending at least half a day here. http://www.birdpark.com.sg/visitor-info/how-to-get-here.html The grounds are spectacular and heliconias are a highlighted feature. Food and beverages cost more in the park's cafe than in town, so make sure you bring water and snacks with you."
,,The highlight is to feed the birds,4.0,,"I wa about to say that this attraction is average. But then i remember the amazing experience I had when I was feeding the birds. You go into this ginormous cage with some kind of porridge that you pay 2SGD for it. Magic happens! Those beautiful birds came ate from my hand, climbed on my shoulders, fight with each other to get the change to eat from your cup. Everything else was for me quite normal, but that experience was ecstatic!
People from the park take pics of you on every possible moment, but the prices they charge for those pics are outrageous. Be aware! And that happened in most of the places we visited In SGP."
,,Birds birds and more,5.0,,Do go and give your eyes a visual treat! Especially go with children and see their excitement when they hear the big colorful parrot speak and sing!
,,Just needs better food options,4.0,,"the place we ate at (the buffet) had a bird smell which was very off putting, but otherwise a nice park, went with 2 young toddlers and they enjoyed, just make sure to bring your stroller!"
,,Better than average bird park,3.0,,"The park isn't spectacular in any way, but worth a visit for animal / bird fans. There is a great variety of birds and a fairly big area to explore, so make sure you take enough time when coming here. However, since it can get very crowded I'd recommend not going on weekends or public holidays."
,,Like the zoo: must go place!,5.0,,"You can see soooo many different varieties of birds: from eagles to parrots, from flamingos to owls!

Also here (as per the zoo) the animals are well taken care of and you can sense and feel the people working there are truly affectionate to them.

You can feed the pelican and the lories (very cute!) and don't forget to see the bird show where you can take a photo with the flamingos for free ;-)

The nursery is also worth a look: it was a steep learning curve not just for my daughter but also for me.

Another nice thing is that there are public busses stopping just in front of the park. We took the metro and then the bus. On the way back we stopped at the metro station where there was a shopping mall and had dinner there.

Worth going there for sure!"
,,Visit before it is moved,4.0,,"Seems there is a plan of relocating this park, hence try to visit as soon as possible. Didn't watch the show but walk around the whole park, lots of nice bird captured. I recommended to watch the show despite we didn't go for it."
,,A Nature lover's paradise!,5.0,,This is truly one of the amazing places that one must visit while in Singapore. There are so many beautiful varieties of birds here.....simply breathtaking! The highlight of our trip was the Bird Show which is touted to be one of the best in the world.
,,colourful,5.0,,"The best bird park in the world it seems. Its a well maintained with all amenities that one do need.
it far away from the singapore centre. Do not miss it. A lot of color full birds n Amphitheatre show was beautiful. Kids will enjoy it. Tram ride too was good."
,,Time your visit...,3.0,,"What can you do on a Sunday in Singapore? Well you could do a lot worse than a walk around Jurong Bird Park. We arrived late morning but soon realised we should have come a lot earlier to avoid the crowds that mostly scared the birds away and to take advantage of the various bird shows that are held mid-morning and mid-afternoon. Nevertheless we saw some unusual birds and enjoyed our walk some of around the park.

Having missed the morning shows through our Sunday morning tardiness and hungry for a late lunch we headed to the bird park's own cafe in the shop at the exit. Not wanting burgers or fried snacks from the other outlets we though we'd try the local food - and regretted our choice almost as soon as we tried it. The chicken accompanying the luke warm coconut rice was a strange piece unidentifiable as to which part it could be, dry, chewy and only just warm. The Singapore Laksa which was devoid of the flavours usually associated with what could almost be the national dish contained just a couple of strips of tofu and a single prawn. The top of the soup was covered in floating globules of orange fat - not at all appetizingand we noticed as we left that other diners had felt the same leaving their bowls almost untouched. And don't be tempted by the ""homemade iced lemon tea"" - the best thing about it was the souvenir plastic cup which inflated the price hugely.

We will return but will bring our own beverages, come earlier and defer eating until we can reach somewhere else."
,,A must visit when you are in Singapore,5.0,,"This is the best bird park I have ever visited. Its huge, has an excellent collection of birds. If you are visiting Singapore with Kids then do not miss this place.

You will be amazed to see what all exist in nature.

Main attraction is the Lory loft area, where different Lories will simply jump on to you. Be careful there with kids.

You must be there to see it."
,,Paradise for nature lovers........,5.0,,A very well maintained and clean Bird park. Beautiful birds great show staff is also very cooperative and polite I went their with 2 kids but didn't faced any kinda problem.....
,,the best that nature has to offer.,5.0,,"THE GOOD: -Excellent map which provides easy navigation. -Different routes suited for different ages. THE BAD: -Some areas are not well ventilated. -More outdoor exhibits, compared with the indoor exhibits. TIPS: -Attend live shows."
,,Bird park is amazing,5.0,,Superb show at about 15:00 hrs Excellent training to birds. Recommend for tourists. Love to visit again if a next tourism trip is planned fro Singapore
,,Huge and Awesome Variety,4.0,,A great place for the kids. We are not bird fans in particular but it was fun to experience the place with our son. The bird show is great with a huge number of them performing on stage. The open air waterfall area is also wonderful. The place is huge and by the evening in the Singapore heat we were pretty tired and relieved to be back to the comfort of our hotel. But still a day well spent and worth going!
,,Awesome Bird Park,5.0,,This was a truly out of the world experience. We loved being here. We could have lived here. There is so much to see. Plan many hours and lots of film to take tons of pictures.
,,Must see,5.0,,This is muse see attraction in singspore for all. All kinds of birds and well maintained park. It has 2 shows at diferent timings. These are not to be missed shows.
,,Not too bad,3.0,,"Two major shows.one is the King of the skies with hawks, owls and vultures(eagles were missing today) the other much bigger arena consists of macaws and hornbills.most of the birds in cages rather than enclosures.good for kids but may not be enough for the wildlife traveller/tourist..the infrastructure is there and I have to commend on that but somehow for me the wow factor was missing.yes, more than enough for the average tourist looking to spend 1.5-2 hours esp if on foot."
,,Well maintained and clean place,5.0,,"We spent nearly 2 hours here and the birds are maintained well. Watching them during feeding time was fun. They have nice restaurants, well priced to relax."
,,Must See,5.0,,"This is a must see place for people of all ages. I liked the kite show(Kings of the Skies Show) very much...was really amazed to see how perfectly they have trained the birds.. there is an option to feed the birds as well. We can travel in tram to different sections.

It is located within the Boon Lay Planning Area of the Jurong district and has an area of 50 acres.The park was opened on 1971.There are 5,000 birds of 400 species in Jurong Bird Park. Of these, 29 are of threatened species"
,,Simply superb....,5.0,,"Birds of various species, colours. The bird's show at ampitheatre is must to watch. The Dolphins are very cute. Very good attraction for Children and bird lovers, as well."
,,Great park,5.0,,Please walk around the park if you don't have little children. The place is much smaller than what it appears on the map and you would miss some nice birds in the park bus
,,Do not miss the shows....,4.0,,We watched the 3pm and 4pm bird shows... They had one of the most amazing birds in very healthy conditions possible. Also it has the world's tallest man-made waterfall.
,,Avian encounters up and close,5.0,,"We had just 2 hr here. We were able to see most birds during tram ride, but best is to walk around and spend time with flamingos, hornbill and macaws. The lori loft provides you with chance to feed parrots with honey. I had 4 of them perching on my shoulders and arm for honey. The amphitheatre shows are well conducted with well trained birds flying all aorund you just above your heads."
,,Best way to spend the day leisurely,4.0,,"""What I most liked was Penguins"" they were very sweet on natural like habitat. Dont take the tram you'll miss a lot.best is to walk around its not that long anyway. They have two three shows.but you must check the schedule before you go."
,,"The website makes it sound amazing, but it's not.",3.0,,"Unfortunately the bird park didn't meet my expectations. The website, indeed the very name, ""bird park"", makes it sound as though you'll be walking through a series of man-made botanic gardens with all the species wandering around for you to spot. However, a lot of the species are actually in cages rather than enclosures, so you don't get very close to a lot of them and it's difficult to take photos through the bars. The biggest disappointment for me was the Lory feeding. We paid $3 each for the tubs of nectar but the birds just were not interested at all and there were so many schoolchildren in there (3 school trips at once!), it was difficult to get around and find a spot to offer your food to the birds.

Having said that, there are some bits of the park that are really worth seeing. The Penguin Coast allows you to see the penguins both above and below water, and we spent a good half hour mesmerized by the penguins bobbing about on the surface of the water and then suddenly diving. The breeding centre was also well worth a look. Here we saw chicks of several species being fed by expert handlers, and there were some baby birds that just made my heart melt, they were so cute.

The price to get into the park was reasonable at S$25 each, but if you want to get close to the birds, e.g. fly the birds of prey or have your photo taken with the parrots, it costs a lot extra. As you enter the park, a member of staff entices you in to get your photo taken with the parrots, exclaiming ""it's free!! Have a go!"" When i asked how much it was (always suspicious of a freebee) she replied again that it was free. It turns out it was actually $45 for one photo, or $150 for 3 sizes of photo plus a cd! Way too expensive in my opinion. The bus to get round the park was only $10, and this does give you some commentary as you drive round, but we found it nice just to wander around and take our time. It's less than 2km to walk, so if you haven't got small children it's easy to do. Do wear some insect repellent though, i got feasted on by the bugs.

As we are only in Singapore for a 3 day stopover, I feel our time and money could have been better spent elsewhere. Apparantly the night safari is amazing."
,,Great Day,5.0,,"This a really nice and well looked after Bird Park. We enjoyed our afternoon out there and visited almost all of the attractions. The Flamingos are beautiful just in from the entrance and the arctic and owl attractions where great.

Its great for families, couples or friends with plenty to do and see. I am not a bird person as was unsure if I would enjoy it but I had a great time. I was able to join in the bird feeding season at the waterfall attraction, having the birds land on your hand or feeding cup was awesome."
,,Must Visit,5.0,,I insist that all travellers should visit this Bird Park and they have many different species of birds and they have trained them so well that its amazing. DO not miss to watch their shows.
,,Excellent for children,5.0,,The place is obviously well maintained and birds are really well taken cared of. The shows are so.enjoyable and one.whole day roaming around the park is all worth it.
,,Beautiful !,5.0,,I have first time seen so many varieties of birds. They were too good and smart in their various shows.
,,Fun filled but needs a renovation quick,4.0,,"We visited this park and really enjoyed the shows. Do not miss the King of the Skies show. Its amazing and if possible do volunteer when the show host asks for one.

What we did not like is that the park has a dull old feel. It hasnt been renovated for years now and the management must think of updating everything including the shows.

Also, the fact that Jurong Bird Park is far away from the other locations of Night Safari / Zoo, one has to take special care of travel time for this.

Overall a good experience though."
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"We celebrated my son's 3rd birthday at Songbird Terrace Restaurant in Jurong Birds' Park last April 2014 and it was amazing! This is one place that you should visit when in Singapore. Kids will love it and adults will enjoy. They have a train that goes around the park so if you don't feel like walking around, you may take the ride and stop on each stations and hop on again after...this park is huge! They also have shows and interactions with the species such as feeding the birds and of course lunch with the birds at Songbird Terrace Restaurant (nice food in there).

I would advise to purchase the entrance ticket on-line to avoid long queue (especially on peak seasons) and sometimes they have a promotion such as 10% off on ticket price.

If you are travelling with kids, make sure that you will bring extra clothes, towel and even swim suits as they may be tempted to dive in the pool."
,,If you like interesting bird species you can't go wrong,4.0,,This is not a place for everyone (If Hitch scared you with the movie The Birds - best to stay away and save your money. Otherwise the size is impressive and the variety of unusual birds to this region makes this an interesting place to visit.
,,Really good shows!,5.0,,"Easy to get to on the bus, and entry is not too expensive. The shows are especially worth seeing. Wear mosquito repellent because there will be the odd one around the shady paths. Has a children's play area."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Loved the sird show with macaws flying around etc etc).
Our second visit here the previous one in 2002.
Missed the monorail which doesn't exist anymore but there is a hop on/hop off road train to save your legs HOWEVER this is an extra charge.
We got there by train and bus which was easy."
,,Good fun for all age group,5.0,,"Earlier i thought this pace was for kids, but we had good fun. all age group people enjoy this place.

tips: check show timings on internet before going. Also go there in afternoon and then take bus to Night safari from there. Its much cheaper and easier. Reaching night safari is bit difficult & expensive if you try to go on your own using MRT\Cab"
,,Excellent entertainment especially for kids,4.0,,"They do some really good presentations and demonstrations, very entertaining. A great change from the hustle and bustle of Singapore."
,,You just cant miss this,5.0,,"I enjoyed each and every moment of my visit here. I appreciate the way they have ensured that the birds are kept as close to their natural habitats. The penguins the flamingos the parrots you name the bird and it is there. They have a tram ride which takes you around the park with 3 stops. you can get of and get in each stop without any charge.
A good way to spend the day."
,,Birds I View,4.0,,You can become a child if you go there. The birds refused to get off my head and shoulder even after I tried to shoo them away. Very beautiful place and a must for kids. Become a kid here.
,,I can never forget this day,5.0,,"It was one of the most beautiful parks I have ever been to. The flamingoes and the pelicans are a must see. Though one does feel a little bad for the parrots and macaus and some of teh birds that are in the cages. The rest of the park is beuatiful and the segment - jewels of teh forest is breathtakingly beuatiful. the feeling of being surrounded by birds in an equatorial forest makes you forget that you are in a city. It's best to buy passes for both the jurong bird park and the singapore zoo together. it turns out to be cheaper and both are expereinces one should not mess. Since it's quite far from the main city, take public transport. it explained pretty well on their website. Also start your day early."
,,Tweet Tweet,4.0,,"The bird park is good - we are not huge bird lovers but had tickets so went along and enjoyed some on the more 'mainstream' shows and animals (penguins, toucans, pelicans). For a bird lover this would be a great visit. Not really geared for public transport although there is a route via Boon Lay + bus which took around 40 mins from downtown Singapore."
,,One of a kind!,4.0,,"Hadn't been to any bird-parks earlier, and had a notion this might be pretty boring one; but pleasantly turned out to be exactly the opposite. Prioritise visiting this ahead of the Night safari or River safari. Choose a less-sunny day to visit this park."
,,Colourful Birds,5.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is one of its kind in the world but has a few siblings in SE Asia.
It is very well maintained.
Each and every encloser has a very detailed description of the birds about its food,habitat and scientific names.
The planning of the park is quite well thought of.Like toilets and restaurants. But one suggestion... while going to such parks every one must wear walking shoes and ladies.... never high hills.Keep water bottles with you... one could be thirsty while the long walks between cages . Don't even think of feeding the birds... they are taken quite good care.
Can buy tickets as combo offer wih some other amusement parks.. for tourists it turns out to be cheaper."
,,A must visit !,5.0,,The Jurong bird park has become almost synonymous with Singapore tourism and it does live up to its reputation. This place is awesome and the shows are done very well. We managed to see two shows-one by the macaws and the other by kites. Both were very entertaining. We relived our childhood!
,,It was ok.,3.0,,"Jurong Bird Park was ok, I wouldn't put it on my list of must do's for Singapore but if you are into birds, don't let me put you off. The Bird Park is easy to get to if you don't mind the excellent subway system. One of the side benefits is you get to go to an excellent shopping mall which is well away from those exclusive shops in the city."
,,lunch with parrots,3.0,,"lunch buffet with parrots is great experience and you can enjoy the show in very close position to parrots. however, the buffet is quite expensive and food quality is fair.
overall, the bird park is average compared to singapore zoo and you can skip it unless you are bird lover."
,,"Birds are plenty, the birds of paradise section is not to be missed",4.0,,"You should use the tram rides inside to visit the different sections within the park, birds are plenty but many of the same variety. The toucans are quite nice, the flamingos are also quite impressive"
,,Must visit for at least 4-5 hours,5.0,,"This is the first place I went during the singapore trip and it came out to be the best place.

Must purchase a tram ticket. You shall must go to all stations specifically artifical waterall and a station before where you can feed parrots. That was one of the wonderful experience.

Be careful about the availability of the taxi. We had to wait 1 hour to catch a taxi as the services were very bad."
,,Lots of birds,3.0,,"If you r a bird lover, you must love it. Or if u bring along with kids. It would be a great experience for the kids as in some of the points, they can feed birds, big birds!

Yet, there is a bad experience that when my friend kid wanna play the electric car next to a restaurant n children playground, we put in $$, didn't work!! then we try n put again... also doesn't work! when we go see for help in the restaurant... they cannot help... said not belong to them but the park... yet there is no park helpers around!!"
,,Kaliedoscope of birds,5.0,,This place is full of stunning kaliedoscope of birds. They have every species of birds to impress an avian lover. You would be mesmerised by the beauty and bright color that some of the birds have. There are also many shows where the birds perform doing various stunts and fly almost touching your head. You must invest in good shoes as you will have to walk a lot to cover the entire Jurong park which is very huge. Take your camera along and click as much as you want. The pictures will all come as if taken by a professional. But of course don't scare them. Entire Singapore is very tourist friendly so you would not have any problem. You can also feed these birds. There are a number of activities organised during the entire day which you can attend them all and know about these wonderful creation at a go. It is a highly recommended place to visit!
,,Aikido trip,4.0,,"Not the biggest of attractions, but the bird show was very good and some things we had not seen at other various bird shows around the world. Worth a visit if in Singapore for more then a few days"
,,Don't miss it when in Singapore,5.0,,"I recently spent a week of family vacation time in Singapore.
On top of our sight-seeing places was Jurong Bird Park.

Getting there:
- It's accessible via MRT and a then onto a bus Interchange. Transit information is easily available

Ticket:
- Adult cost is SDG 30, including the tram. The tram ticket is worth the money as you can ride on it through the day, specially when covering far corners of the park.

Shows:
- There are two main shows included as part of the ticket and two paid ones. There are also bird feeding sessions throughout the park. Don't have the timings for those.

I attended the afternoon shows, but I have read reviews that the morning shows work well.
They start at 10am.
For afternoon shows,be sure to reach the venue at least 15 minutes ahead of time as the hall fills up fast.
Also recommended are middle of the hall seats, not top and not front row.
The show presenters choose volunteers in the bird show among the middle rows.
So you can try your luck to be one of the lucky ones who will have birds flying to you and landing on your arms. :)

Birds:
Can't remember. There are just too many! The Waterfall Aviary is a great place to start as you can get to walk around the habitats and watch bird up close.
A good tip is to take the tram to the farthest uphill point and then walk down the slope. Much better this way.

Interestingly, there is a small bird-themed water park for children.
If I knew this earlier, I would have carried an extra pair of clothes for my daughter.
It's a lot of fun and I recommend carrying a towel and extra pair of clothes if you are visiting with your kids. Kids love it at the middle of hot and sultry Singapore day.

Food:
- Being a Vegetarian, was disappointed that there was not a lot of choice for the price we paid.

Keep a full day at the park as you can explore the park at leisure.

All in all, a must see Singapore attraction for all ages."
,,Magnificent!,5.0,,"This place is a must visit for the sheer variety of birds in all there magnificent beauty housed here . There are complimentary trams to ride on to rest those legs considering the long walks. Do not miss the penguin feeding sessions and the pelican talk (chk for timings before ) . The man made waterfall is a photographers delight. The aviaries are superbly maintained and a treat to your eyes. You can save on ticket costs by taking a combined ticket with entry into the zoo , night safari and the bird park . Ask for the combo tickets at any of these venues. Walking shoes highly recommended."
,,paradise,5.0,,truly a paradise for a wildlife lover like me .....why can't we have bird parks and zoo's like this in our country....i braved the heavy rains to reach this place and it was totally worth it...the shows and the exhibits were amazing....the way these parks are being managed is totally awesome....want to visit it again and again
,,Day with colorful birds,5.0,,"Admission for adults $25.00, Kids $16.00, Senior Citizens $10.00, Online booking available
They have wide range of Bird species, Plan on spending 4-5 hours @ Park
We loved watching all Bird shows.. especially High Fliers show. Dont miss watching all the shows

You can see Flamingos, Parrots, Swans, Mandarin Ducks, Pelicans etc. all in huge numbers.
You can purchase a cup of bird food mixture that will attract gorgeous parrots and other birds alighting on your cup to eat

Have very few options for dining, so plan accordingly...!"
,,A must see attraction of singapore,5.0,,The park is a gem.truly it is a riot of colourful birds esp the Lory.hornbills.parrots etc.the shows are spectacular.the penguin feeding was awesome.you need at least 4-5 he's to see the park.you can feed the lorys in plastic cups.but try to be early so that they come to feed easily.
,,Nice bird park,4.0,,everything is best in jurong bird park.all the shows are perfect and best in class.(must watch) the only problem is with kids play area. they need some cleanliness....by few afford and one or two helper they can improve the service.
,,"Yes, if you love birds",5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park was suggested by one of my friends to me and it is worth a visit. There are different Bird Shows during Day time. Must watch Sasy bird Show. There are Flamingos,Peacocks, Parrots, etc Truly the Best Bird Park i have seen."
,,Bird Lovers Paradise,4.0,,"- Conveniently located near Boon Lay MRT station on EW line
- Bus no. 194 / 251 from Boon Lay MRT station to Jurong Bird park
- 2.5/3 hours sufficient to view this park
- Bird show at 11 am at Pool Amphi is must watch"
,,Worth spending some time,5.0,,"The Bird Park has some very good shows which are informative as well as amusing. The birds are also mostly kept in large enclosures or open areas. There are many different and are species and we can learn a lot . The park is vast ,one can take a tramtour and then visit the places one like . Be sure to have lot of time beacuse once you get lost in admiring the birds time will fly"
,,Eye on Birds,4.0,,"Wow, a stunning collection. The two shows one with small birds and the other with predators was excellent. The lory loft and even the waterfall are places one can spend time. Plan your trip around the feeding and shows. My teenage kids of course found it a little boring. But for my wife and me it was interesting. Again lots of walking, so dress comfortably.
I find the food in the parks are highly priced and it is better to carry some sandwiches and drinks. The train is a good way to move around and also catch the shows, give time for the fact that many have the same idea and they do not accept standees. Better to start early as on a hot day it can get tiring."
,,Must see,5.0,,"The huge aviary is brilliant, watching birds fly round in close proximity. The pelicans roosting in the trees is also a wonderful sight."
,,Amazing,5.0,,The variety of the birds are great. Do not miss the scheduled bird shows which keep the young and old entertained. Good access.
,,Nice Variety of Birds,4.0,,The Variety of Birds especially the Butterflies park was very attaractive location a must visit place for all visiting Singapore. The distance is not far
,,Excellent bird-centric zoo.,4.0,,"Much like the similarly excellent Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, the Jurong Bird Park exhibits a wide range of animals (in this case birds) in well-constructed and comfortable housings. If there's a criticism to be made it's simply that this is a very focused attraction: if you don't like birds or find them interesting, there's not a lot to recommend here. If you *are* interested, however, it is a top notch attraction. It's easily reached via train and bus as well."
,,Well worth it,5.0,,"I must admit I am not a bird person but totally loved this place and looking back it remains a fond memory. Give yourself enough time and its a good walk around. Stayed there for around 3 hours so allow yourself some time. Cant recall the price but it was relatively not that expensive. If you are staying in town, its an easy train ride out which is half the fun as you get to see the ""other"" part of Singapore. There are buses avail at the train stop to take you to the park."
,,You like birds? This is the place.,5.0,,The variety of birds is probably unparalleled. Check out the aviary with the artificial waterfall: stunning!
,,"Place great, bird ok",4.0,,"I would say the variety of birds is a lot. But it is not easy to see all of them as the birds sometime will be too far to see. I don’t know what people can see when they ride the tram, even by foot, we hardly see the bird closely. Recommended to spend whole day if you bird enthusiast and if you like to take a lot of pictures. But for normal walk 4hours will be sufficient. Mostly they display those colorful birds like parrot. There rest of the species is limited in number.
btw the waterfall is totally brilliant and super creative!

And the locker is great place to keep bulky item. Not expensive as well, as i remember its about 2$"
,,AMAZING PLACE!,5.0,,"This bird park is not a big park but clean and have lots of beatiful birds. They also have a very good bird shows.

Here you can see many kinds of birds and be able to interact with them. Those birds seems so happy with their home... and so did I...,.. where I can walk around and meets all birds around the world and also we can feed them, play with them and even take their pictures from a very close distance.

To reach this bird park you can take either bus or taxi, we family of four take a cab from orchard road and ended up paying around SGD 20.Quick and hussle free!

The entry ticket fee is SGD 39 but you can get a 15% discount by flying with Singapore Airlines."
,,Best kept secret in Singapore,5.0,,"I am at the Jurong Bird Park simply because of reviews from tourists comparing it to the KL bird park and thought I should see it for myself

Took a cab from Vivocity. 10 mins maybe because it was 830am on a public holiday Deepavali. Very few people. (By 1030am the crowd picked up). Have a nasi lemak breakfast at entrance. Reasonable price.

Take a tram ride and start with waterfall aviary then move downwards to Pelican and flamingo lake and lory loft. These are walkin aviary if you don't want to see the caged birds. The landscaping is excellent, comparable to Botanic Gardens.

The birds are healthy and morning they're energetic and feeding."
,,Superb colour and variety,5.0,,"There really are all sorts here, well presented in trees, low vegetation, water habitats and high walkways to see much of it.

It's a festival of colour and magnificent species we Europeans would never dream of let alone see.

Best come early in the morning, before it gets too hot and before it gets too crowded - only downside is this place is hot and mobbed on a weekend afternoon."
,,Must see when in Singapore,5.0,,"This park is big, incredibly well made and worth every minute there. Keep in mind though that its usually warm and very humid...."
,,Speechless!,5.0,,"We took a taxi from our hotel in Bugis to the Bird Park and reached here by 9 am.We were here till 4:30 pm. Watched two of the shows ""High Fliers"" and """"Kings of the skies"". The shows were really fun and entertaining as well as informative. Our daughter loved it. We could not make it to many of the feeding sessions. We just went to one of them ""Pelican chit-chat"". Again, a fun interaction which also provided information about these birds. Our daughter really enjoyed feeding fishes to the pelicans. Like the zoo, what impresses you the most is the thought behind the design of each enclosure which gives these birds ample freedom without confining them in small/cramped spaces.

We were done by 4:30 pm and walked to the taxi queue. We did not have a pre-booking for taxi and ended up waiting 2 hours in the queue before we could get one. Please, please ensure that you pre-book a taxi for your return if you do not intend to use public transport."
,,It was OK,4.0,,"Clean, beautiful birds, some we have heard of but never seen here in Australia and others we have never heard of and had a new experience. The kids saw 1/2 the Park and had enough. They were more excited about the water play at the end of the day than the Bird Park. The 2 choices of food/restaurants there were very poor. Glad we did it but wouldn't rave about it."
,,Two thumbs up!,5.0,,This place is super awesome. This place is highly recommended for a family day out. Do not miss any part of the program because it is all awesome
,,Thoroughly enjoyable,5.0,,"I decided to get the hopper ticket and to do all three parks in one day (the river safari was closed but make sure you are aware of this beforehand as the guy on the kiosk tried to sell me the 4in1 ticket). I stayed here for around three hours, which was more than enough for me to see everything.

There are plenty of opportunities to interact with the birds and they all seem to have plenty of room in their cages. I do understand people who give bad reviews due to stuff being caged, and while I do agree with this, these birds never need to worry about food or shelter, and for me they are birds I wouldn't be able to see unless I visited a number of different countries.

The food and professional photos are expensive, but there is no obligation to buy. The park isn't massive so I wouldn't plan on spending the day here unless you are intending on viewing every show and also having lunch.

There is a bus which leaves at two intervals for the zoo/night safari. I chose the taxi option which was around $20 and far quicker with less waiting about. I didn't want the hassle of public transport so can't comment on that option, but I got a train to Jurong East and then took a taxi from here.

Just be aware the bird park and zoo are nowhere near each other. It makes more sense to do the bird park followed by zoo and then night safari if you want as a lot of travelling inbetween if you start at the zoo."
,,Too good!!,4.0,,Its a bliss to the eye...loved the tram ride that takes you to various places inside the park..you can see colorful parrots everywhere and there was a bird show which was too good...it was surprising to see how well the birds are trained...but to take a pic with the parrots they charge a bomb...like 20$ for a single pic...loved the flamingos...and waterfall inside the park
,,Highly Recommended!,5.0,,"We were a family who visited the Bird park. Highly entertaining and beautifully maintained. We were able to watch 2 shows and both of them were really fun to watch. They call in audience members as volunteers for checking out the birds up close so +1 for that! We were not able to see the whole place in one day, as couple of shows were clashing with each other. There are these small food kiosks located at places too, in case you want to grab something to munch on or to drink something. A good family hangout!"
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,"This was one of the best experiences I had in Singapore, there are so many different birds, also the shows are jaw dropping! Best I thought was the show with birds of prey (Kings of the air) including Vultures, Pelicans are a hoot! so many Flamingo's too. Loved it good value when bought with the entrance to other attractions like the night safari also recommended"
,,Excellent for Children,4.0,,Good collection of birds High Flyer Show and the King of the Skies shows are good and children would love it. Has a tram and an artificial waterfall in the park itself. worth a visit
,,Lovely bird park!,5.0,,This is a lovely place to spend a family day out. Their program for the whole day is nice and interesting that both adults and kids will definitely enjoy. Highly recommended
,,Loads to see,4.0,,"We really enjoyed our visit, especially our daughter. She fed penguins by hand and got up close with some birds. The only thing she didn't like was that some of the enclosures seemed very small and basic such as some of the owls. These were disappointing to see."
,,A must Visit,5.0,,"If you like fauna, this place is amazing. You can see many birds, also interact with them. Bring your family will be great ! This is place for you animal lover."
,,Wonderful for bird lovers but not perfect,5.0,,"I am a major bird lover and had been wanting to visit this place for years. Overall it was what i had been expecting but was sad to see so many of the birds in cages rather than in aviaries. The lory loft was wonderful but i thought there would be more birds feeding, maybe if I arrived at opening time they would have been hungrier. There are many rare birds here like the 12 wire bird of paradise, really a treat to see them. The discovery center is a wonderful idea but needs to be renovated. Also it was good to see the breeding center with all of the babies being fed. Hopefully people will leave this place with a greater appreciation of our feathered friends."
,,Lovely bird sanctuary,5.0,,I love this place i love their bird selections and my fvorite spot is those pink birds with long legs area. Forgot rhe name of the birds sorry
,,Great place admits nature and birds,5.0,,"Great place to see exotic birds. Learn about their habitat food etc. you need about six hours to take snaps and enjoy walking slowly. Ample coffee shops, restrooms shades available inside. Don't worry if you forgot yours stroller u can hire one. Fantastic place you can feed birds, play, listen to them talk. Don't miss the research center to learn the process of breeding. Carry a complete camera kit fully charged batteries as u ll end up exhausting ur batteries by the end of your trip. Don't miss the amphitheater in the entrance. We'll maintained and good venue for young kids."
,,Caged Bird,5.0,,"The Park was an AMAZING place, where guest could learn alot about birds and knowing on how to take care of them. Riding the monorail around the park so that you could vist all of the cages in the park. They range from Dessert birds from the south to the Winter wasteland of the icy north, where kids to adults wil always enjoy the sight of the birds wonderful and majestic feathers of hunters of the sky."
,,bird park,4.0,,"beautiful park birds flying free not in cages. Shows were brilliant with audience participation, well worth a visit."
,,What a lovely place on earth,4.0,,"The birds are so happy with the ""forest"" and so do i...walking around and meet all birds from around the world..they are so prety..
The area so clean and green and so wild, if you are lucky you can meet iguana or lizard..
But on waterfall cage..the place is so hot. May be because of the net..
Overall ok and i would come again.."
,,excellent birds,4.0,,Though was a sunny day and could not walk much but enjoyed every bit of the park with huge rare collections of birds inculding the penguins for which they have set up a -6 C enclosure wonderful
,,Impressive attraction,4.0,,"We spent several hours at the bird park and were impressed by the quality of the aviaries. It was lovely to walk through aviaries amongst the birds and see them at close quarters, I particularly enjoyed feeding the Lorikeets. The talks were informative but aimed at all ages. The park layout was easy to get around and transport to and from the park was easy by mrt and bus."
,,Tired,3.0,,"Although the variety of birds is quite amazing, the whole place looked tired and in need of an upgrade. Staff were a bit disinterested. Or maybe it was a bad day."
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"This is a fantastic place with an amazing collection of birds. It is not as crowded as the zoo as relatively fewer people choose to visit but I would definitely want to come back. The Kings of the Sky show is very good and informative. Plan to spend at least 3-4 hours here

Tips:
Don't miss the Lory feeding at the Lorry Loft. Kids will love it and the lorries are very friendly.
The waterfall aviary is fantastic. The birds are roaming freely there in their natural habitat and aren't afraid of humans
They also have a free rain park just like the Singapore zoo"
,,Brilliant bird park,5.0,,The place is splendid. We enjoyed the day spent there. Their whole day program is good enough for adults to enjoy too. Will comeback some other time definitely.
,,Too Good,5.0,,Lovely place for birds lovers. The show was too good. A large Variety of birds and species. Its an experience to visit this place once.
,,Brilliant day out!,5.0,,"Would def recommend this as a must do on your trip. Just the most amazing collection of birds you will ever see! I'm not a bird lover as such and wouldn't normally go to this kind of attraction but jurong us amazing!
You can get a tram ride around, but it's only once around. Shame you clang get on and off as much as you like as you can at the Zoo.
The Lorry Loft is great, you can pay $3 for a little cup of nectar and feed the lorries.
The Waterfall Aviary is great too.
We saw 2 great shows - Kings of the Sky (eagles and vultures) and another good show in the Pools Ampitheatre with macaws, pelicans and flamingoes.
The bird park was nowhere near as busy as the zoo so it was a really pleasant walk around.
Near the entrance/exit you can get your photo taken with birds. Be warned it's $45 for just one photo though! That's way more than it fists to even get into the place!"
,,Very nice,5.0,,"Singapore Parks are very well kept. Very organize, you don't even feel any que. Do not miss any of the shows around the park, they are really cool !......"
,,Some one stolen my bag,1.0,,"Some one stolen my bag when i sit for Bird Fly show. I lost my money, my keys and cards. I am writing to share for visitor, who have to take their stocks carefully. I dont want see there any."
,,brilliant,5.0,,"We only had 2 hours there, but could easily have spent a whole day there! We particularly enjoyed the keepers' talks and being able to get so close to the birds. Thank you."
,,We love this place,4.0,,"Don't see how you could dislike this place,it is a bird park so a bit noisy at time but well done,always impressed by the birds of prey exhibition and of course the cloud of the macaws amongst others."
,,Fantastic and accessible bird park,5.0,,Surprisingly huge park wuperbly well laid out with a major selection of birds in beautifully kept and picturesque surroundings. All day interest finding new areas to see and spectacular wildlife. Some interactive areas and great signage and facilites for familtes of all ages!
,,Great place for kids,4.0,,"Nice place -Lots of interactive sessions. Liked the Pelican Chit chat session, Sabrina's painting by the bird session,The final show at the amphitheatre- don't miss it."
,,Not impressed,3.0,,"The Zoo, the Jurong Bird Park and the Night Safari are all hyped a lot - but really are very average to visit. Plus the weather makes it not very comfortable to walk around or enjoy it with little kids in tow. Plan to spend just half a day and not more if you are traveling with kids, make sure you rent a stroller and make use of the tram ride. The parks are also not very easy to get to, being far away from the main part of the city."
,,Bird Central,4.0,,"Jurong bird park is a bit further out of the hustle and bustle of Singapore. Our visit started with torrential rain, so the train/tram around the park was packed with long queues to start with, so we found it easier to walk instead. The park is very stroller friendly (we brought our own but they are available for hire too). The park itself is not as well maintained Singapore zoo, but it is lush and tropical with amazing birds and enclosures. The staff were friendly and helpful too. It has a great little water play area so definitely pack swimmers for the kids to cool off in. We purchased a triple entry ticket for the zoo, night safari and bird park and it was the surprise hit with our kids."
,,Poor birds very small cages,1.0,,So many beautiful crammed in small cages and over populated community cages. Over priced and bad quality food.
,,Good for kids and those who loves birds,4.0,,Plenty of birds. Variety of species. Two bird shows worth to watch. You should take the tram ride to show you what you can see in the park.
,,fantastic!,4.0,,"though a bit far, the trip going to this bird park is all worth it. Their bird collections are awesome and my personal favorite is the nocturnal birds area:)"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Such a beautiful bird sanctuary! We enjoyed seeing such amazing birds in different colours and sizes! My son enjoyed feeding the birds at Lory Loft. We visited on a weekday around mid day and groups of school kids were leaving the park. Tip- don't forget to bring your swimmers! We made sure to save the water park bit for last. It was the perfect way to cool off from the heat and humidity!!! And it was empty!!!

We took the MRT and bus there which took an hour and 20 minutes. On the way back to our hotel we took a taxi which took 20 minutes and cost us only $15!!!!!"
,,"Great attraction very interesting, but with transport issues!",4.0,,"This was our second visit to the Bird Park, the first visit 6 years ago. It is a very interesting park with lovely gardens & a very big range of exotic birds. The two bird shows both held twice daily, in the morning & the afternoon are a ""must see"". We were disappointed to find that the MonoRail that was originally installed has been removed & replaced with a ""road running train"". Still does the job of taking you around the park but lacks the great view of the elevated MonoRail. It is a great day for couples & families alike & you should be sure to go there when you visit Singapore. The only complaint is the transport options. We took a taxi to the park but when we exited at about 4.30pm there was a big queue for taxis & only a few arriving spasmodically. After waiting for an hour and 40 minutes we gave up & walked to the local bus stop 150 metres away & caught the only bus which took us to Boon Lay transit centre, we walked to the nearby Jurong Point Shopping Centre & finally got a taxi there after 15 minutes wait in a queue. Our total time for our trip home was 3 hours for a trip to get to the park that was about 25 minutes. There are not enough taxis in Songapore! Make sure you book a cab for a pick up after the last show for about 4.30-4.45 well in advance of leaving the park. A late booking results in an SMS saying "" no taxis available"". We had numerous other "" no taxis available"" at other locations in Singapore during our 2 week stay."
,,Huge Zoo Dedicated to Birds,4.0,,"We enjoyed this place. Especially the walk-in exhibits where you can interact with the birds. Getting there required the metro plus a bus, but short bus ride."
,,best in asia,5.0,,i think this is the best in Asia that i have ever visited. the place is well maintained the area is so clean. the birds are awesome and my favorite spots are the flamingo area and the nocturnal birds
,,Great visit,5.0,,"This was a ""must see"" as per our kids itinerary for Singapore. And it didn't disappoint. It was very hot, of course, which made it difficult to walk around a lot but we did have a tram ticket included with our 3 park pass ticket which was great as it takes you uphill, past a lot of exhibits and drops you off close to the main aviaries. The 2 shows were entertaining and informative. The bird exhibits were great and all the birds looked happy and healthy."
,,Sunbirds,5.0,,Well worth the slightly longer journey from the city. Look up at the entrance and you may catch sight of sunbirds busy round the overhanging flowers - I thought they were gigantic bumble bees at first!
,,Good bird park,5.0,,"Clean, many kinds of birds and attractions. Too far from other attraction, so please plan your trip here. Close to science center which is good for kids."
,,Largest Bird Park in numbers,4.0,,"Well, Jurong Bird Park is known for being the largest in terms of the number of birds and 2nd largest in terms of species. So definitely a good place to visit if you want to see birds.

We took our time at the bird park so it took us more than 3 hour to complete the park. The place we stay the longest was lory loft. We get to feed the lory and they were pretty. They might stand on your hand if you are lucky.

Make sure you don't miss the shows there too. It was pretty cool."
,,For Bird Lover,4.0,,"Wow, this a great Bird Park. Prepare to spend 2 hours or more, otherwise you are not able to enjoy those lovely birds of every kinds. So many so many funny and special birds.
Well, perhaps I am too excited but I really love this Bird Park.

I do not rate 5 star only because this park is a little bit old...I mean it will look much better if have more funding..."
,,calm place,4.0,,not many places where you find so many different and colourful bird species under one roof. fun for kids too
,,Lovely flamingos!,5.0,,The place is so wonderful. The arrangement is very nice and the place is obviously well maintained. We will definitely comeback.
,,Every 'twitcher' should make a beeline for this one,5.0,,Birds are my number one favourite of all wildlife and this park did not fail to impress. Don't miss the 'Waterfall' Aviary with its incredible 100' waterfall. Flying displays of various birds was also impressive but not so sure of actual enclosures of incredible diversity of parrots who looked really miserable and seemed to be in need of a good spray of water in temps above 34 degrees. Map could be a little less complicated as found myself ending up in same place on more than one occasion - not great on a very hot day. Birds of S.East Asia closed for renovation at time of visit. Could have spent all day here but visited on last day of stay and had to get back to hotel for transfer to airport. Don't leave this one to your last day if you are a real bird enthusiast.
,,perfect sanctuary,5.0,,we visited the bird park on our 4th day in SG. it provided us with a surprisingly nice respite from all the bustle and hustle of the city. it was like having a downtime but still being a productive tourist :D. the bird show was really fun to watch.
,,Perfect Place for a family dayout,5.0,,The place is so neat and Well-maintained. The birds. They keep are all well fed too. My favorite Spot is the flamingo Area!
,,A lovely place to visit,4.0,,Very enjoyable but if possible go in fine weather. It was raining quite hard when we went and the birds could only put on a partial show. Plus you weren't able to appreciate the beautiful grounds and aviaries as much in the rain.
,,A bit tired.,2.0,,This place is ok if you like to see exotic birds in cages that are way too small and in need of replacement. Didn't like it much at all.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,If you love birds and this place is a MUST to visit when you are in Singapore. They have many different species of Birds and you can take photographs with beautiful birds too
,,A bird in the hand,5.0,,this bird park is amazing. All the different areas and species of birds and the layout is very good. The only downside was the smell from the flamingos and the fact the road train only had 3 stops.
,,Beautiful Birds,5.0,,Best time to arrive is 14:00 when they start to feed the birds in the large aviary. You can hold up the food and the birds sit on your hand to eat it
,,See birds in a natural setting,4.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is done to showcase the myriad of bird species in a natural setting.

Here, you can enjoy a day out with your family. If you have kids, they will also enjoy the 'live' show where you get to see different type of birds performing the various show segments.

Do schedule at least 5 hours to spend at the park."
,,Not worth,3.0,,Expected to watch different types of birds but Not many varieties could see except a few common Asian birds.
,,Loved the Hornbills,3.0,,"Having seen wild Hornbills in Malaysia I was impressed with the park's variety of this bird. I was however underwhelmed with the various lacklustre cages. Many birds but uninspiring presentation.

There was also the fact that we took the MRT to the nearest station to the park expecting some directions but we were in the middle of nowhere. Hailed a passing cab which took us there cheaply."
,,Ok. good distraction for children,4.0,,"Went there by guided tour.Children seemed to like the place. Was ok. Best to go there unrushed, by 'guided tour' time schedules."
,,KALEIDOSCOPE OF BIRDS,5.0,,"This amazing bird sanctuary is truly an unbelievable "" kaleidoscope of birds"" where ""color lives"".You must devote or earmark a full day for this attraction if you wish to see and enjoy this park even if you are not a bird lover.First of all, purchase ticket online from their site because you can skip the Q and also get a rebate by using your credit card Moreover, if you buy tickets for other attractions like Singapore zoo,night safari or river cruise, you get discounts Then for coming to the park-a special bus called Singapore attraction express (SAE) runs between these places from Orchard or Little India for a nominal fare of S$6 to and fro The park opens at 8-30 am ,so be there as early as possible to beat the tropical sun!.Then get hold of a map and see the different sections but please do not forget to visit Waterfall aviary which is a wonderful piece of topical rain forest with a 13 stories high waterfall Please also check the feeding time of birds which is simply amazing! King of the sky show is also very impressive After you come back, you will be charmed with the intelligence, obedience,precision and loyalty of the birds"
,,Worth a visit.,4.0,,"It has been 30+ years since we last visited the Jurong Bird Park. There is a wonderful collection of a huge variety of birds. Our favourites were the baby flamingoes in the nursery with other hatchlings, the toucans and the hornbills, the scarlet ibis and the penguins. The ""Birds Flying High Show' was also a highlight.
The food available was well below par so we suggest taking your own food. Buy water at an outlet (S$2) compared with a vending machine(S$3.50)."
,,Very nice bird park,5.0,,The birds they have on this this park are all so wonderful. My personal favorite is the flamingo area. All those pink flamingos are so relaxing to look at. Recommended for kids and adults as well.
,,Worth a visit....kinda,4.0,,"It should be obvious that you should like birds to visit this place. Well....I don't like birds. But in my defense, I visited the place because we (5 and 8 yo girls, and my mom) were from the science center and has a few more hours to burn in Jurong area. So, bird park it is.

We got there around 3.30 pm. It was quiet and not so many people. We bought the 2 for 1 ticket (zoo and bird park, trams on both locations included). Great deals!

Because it was late we can only catch the predator bird show. It was awesome! A bit silly with the costumes etc, but still awesome.

The breeding building was interesting.

The lory feeding was wild. Word of warning, should not give your young child the food cup. Those birds went to my younger daughter and perched on her arms, head, and shoulders and fight to get the food. It was cute and great photo opportunity, but those claws are sharp. And they won't fly away.

All in all, it was a memorable time and place. Great place for a walk even if you don't like birds. And don't forget your mosquito cream/patch!"
,,"Lots of birds, great place",4.0,,"I would say that the Bird Park is not a must go if you have limited time in Singapore- the zoo or night safari is better if you have to choose.

But saying that if you love all things birds, go for it! The kids love the penguins and got to go there during feeding time. We went near Chinese New Year so the place was all decked out.

The man made waterfall was amazing and for a long time it was the biggest one around.

Love the flamingos...there were sooooo many of them and so colourful.

We took a cab there."
,,Well Worth a Visit,5.0,,Another visit to this bird park was well worthwhile. The shows are fantastic. Interactive for children and adults and you get very close to the birds. Best to go early morning or late afternoon. I was there this time at the very end of the day. It was quieter ( not so many people) and we were able to watch the keepers feed the birds from about 4pm onwards. Not too hot as there are lots of trees and shade. Every visitor to Singapore to visit this Park.
,,Wonderful day in nature,4.0,,"As always, keeping up to date with Singapore's high standard, the bird park is entertaining and full of nature's wonders to marvel at."
,,You can't be closer to the animals,5.0,,The shows were excellent and entertaining. All kind of birds in an ambient that is nice for birds and humans. I will visit again
,,Bird Park,3.0,,Just a great walk where you get to see birds and exhibits. There is a bird show where the intelligence of birds are demonstrated.
,,Great park lousy food,4.0,,This is a great park but the food inside is horrible and expensive. Make sure to bring your own food or eat before you go
,,BIRDS PARADISE...,4.0,,"We loved this place specially Lori loft. If you are a bird lover then its a paradise for you. First We visited full area by train and then second time by walking. We loved the place. An excellent collection of birdlife. Plenty of shade for those hot humid days, and plenty of seats. to sit on. You can use public transport to get to the park, or the taxis are well priced."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Tied this in with a trip to the zoo, bird park in the morning and zoo in the afternoon, though could happily have spent longer at the bird park. It's very well laid out with a 'tram' that, as long as you can walk reasonable distances in the heat, you don't need. Highlight for me was the waterfall area. Lots of birds flying around, but also very well-placed feeding stations giving visitors a better opportunity to see birds close up (and in my case get some photos of birds I'd never seen before). Large kids play area (with lots of water), so should appeal to all. There is a shuttle bus to the zoo, but best to check the times on the SAEX website as the bird park staff told me the wrong times."
,,fun and interesting experience,3.0,,"A unique attrqction with manmade waterfall and all! Havent come across anything similar anywhere ekse, and the kids all had a great time."
,,tony,5.0,,"We are bird lovers , this bird park is second to none , the pure variety is amazing , all beautifully kept and presented , so many species ."
,,"An amazing experience at Jurong Bird Park, Singapore",5.0,,"Prior to my visiting Singapore I had heard of Jurong Bird Park, but did not have an idea of having such enjoyable moments while at the park. There were so many varieties of different bird species, well maintained and could be viewed from such close distances. The inclusion of vultures in the cages also was very interesting as it no more seen often.
The park authorities also provide(with a cost of course) a transport to ferry on visitors from one point to another.
The birds I liked were parakeets, pelicans, hornbills, peacock and others.
The time we spent over there will remain a ever memorable one."
,,Stunning birds,5.0,,"An excellent collection of birdlife. Plenty of shade for those hot humid days, and plenty of seats. to sit on. You can use public transport to get to the park, or the taxis are well priced"
,,Birds and more,4.0,,"Just to see all these birds which is is not possible otherwise is the novelty,superbly maintained and the best possible"
,,Colourful!,5.0,,"Between Jurong bird park and Singapore zoo if you ask me to pick up one then I will surely go for Jurong bird park. Its more open and I felt there are more experiences here at this place. If you have a child then ensure to carry his/ her swimming costume for Birds at play.Its a water park where your child would just love to play. Also always follow the timing of all the shows so that you don't miss any. Don't forget to go on Lory's Loft where those beautiful birds will come close to you to have their food. Also buy the ticket always along with the tram ride since its again a very big park. You can always rent a stroller for your child and If I remember correctly then it is for some 9 SGD

Important Note: In Jurong bird park, At least I have seen the water is available only at Bird discovery center so you can fill up your bottle at this place."
,,Flying like a bird.,5.0,,"It was actually flying like a bird experience. Most recommended for family with kids. But my choice do not take the tram ride, discover by walk, so that you can see all the birds and take pics. The shows were awesome. Unique attraction in singapore"
,,awesome,4.0,,"I visited Jurong bird park last year and it was very awesome
like you can meet almost every kind of birds exist and how the park was build that visitors can interact nicely with all the animals is very good
I would like to visit again next time I am visiting Sinagpore :D"
,,flying free,4.0,,"Most of the 'residents' here are of the flying sort except for a few like Flamingos. Their legs are so slim, and very graceful! The place is a bit far from downtown (nearest is Boon Lay Train Station), and you need to change to a bus to stop right in front of the Bird Park, but it brings you to the fringe of the city (sort of). I always like the feeding times, I am surprised the birds can 'clip on' to the hands with such strength! (for the feeding times). The parrots are very beautiful, very intense and bright colours of Mother Nature. Bring enough water as it can be quite hot."
,,Nostalgic,4.0,,I have not been here for over 10 years but it was exactly the way I remember it and if not better. They really maintain the place it looked brand new. Take the time to just explore the park apart from just looking at the birds....even though they are in cages it doesnt really feel like a zoo. You must go to the Lori Lofts exhibition where the loris flew freely and would it go up close to you to feed from your hand! It was such an amazing experience.
,,Best Bet,4.0,,"Love, love, love. Experiencing to feed the lory with syrup, the colourful birds fly happily and freely. You can take a tram inside the park to go around quickly or walk on your feet. Worth coming."
,,Some of the most interesting birds seemed to be on holdiays,4.0,,"The south asian bird exhibits were shut and given we were in South Asia that was disappointing. And in many of the aviaries some how the free flying birds were invisible on the day we visited.
Flamingos were impressive and the pelicans if you haven't seen them before, but we live a few kilometres from a daily feeding so nothing new for us."
,,fantastic colours,5.0,,the lory loft is a must what a brilliant array of colours. Hadsome syrup to feed them and the birds sit on you. Gods wonderful creation
,,Birds and other creatures,4.0,,"If you love birds, this is the place to go to. We went there for the bird show as it's pretty good. The trainers did an excellent job."
,,Bird heaven,5.0,,"Brilliant park! We are bird lovers and really enjoyed this 4 hour tour. I even got picked to participate in the ""Birds of Prey"" show and had a vulture land on my arm - awesome! Would definitely recommend this tour to anyone going to Singapore."
,,discover colorful paradise,4.0,,"a largest bird park, jurong bird park where are 5 thousand birds, one a largest collection of birds in the world"
,,Amazing collection of birds,5.0,,Try to get at least 2 hours for the visit as we spent almost 4 here and I'm afraid we still have missed much. Buying the ticket online will save you some money (if you get park hopper ticket) and also save you tons of time as you skip the queue and head straight to the entrance gate. The place is conviently split into theme zones and you may choose ones that suit your liking better or just go around and explore the entire place. Lorry feeding experience is truly unforgettable.
,,A great retreat for bird lovers,5.0,,The amazing sanctuary of birds is a paradise for bird lovers. and I loved the shows where i could interact with the birds directly.
,,Fly Away,5.0,,Great Place for the Whole Family..big and small...here you get to see alot of bird species and bird shows..very entertaining...
,,amazing collection of parrots and Macaus...,5.0,,"Though there are many other birds, varieties of parrots and macaus will have the most lasting impression on your mind.. some birds are more beautiful and colourful then the flowers.."
,,The only few places I would recommend for tourists,5.0,,"Have been there multiple times and love it. A very good place with many birds, including rare ones. Highly recommend for family with kids and photo enthusiasts. Check show time and make sure you don't miss it. The only downside is that it is too far from city centre."
,,Bird paradise,5.0,,range of birds from tucans to penguins.lots of ponds and flowers the penguin was my favorite and i got to see it in a packed fridge i guess.artificial waterfalls ar also placed to add peace and the realxing feeling.this is a Must try
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"The bird park was very well organised and the layout easy to follow. The number of steps to be negotiated was not exceptional and the walks between displays pleasurable. The high flyer display was particularly good with a lot of audience participation.
Downside was taxi availability at the exit. Suggest you walk to bus stop and get the bus to the MRT at Boon Lay and then to the city."
,,Good,3.0,,Was good enough though not so Exciting... Liked the different kinds of species present... The travel was bit expensive as it was quite far... Good place to go once
,,Get closer to the beatiful birds!,5.0,,"Adults rather than kids loved feeding birds there and a great variety of birds you can see in this park. The shows were what we didn't want to miss and they were worth time. It turned out that we spent more than half day, longer than we planned. We took the bus and MRT to get there and it's quite easy to get there. Not so crowded as Night Safari, we enjoyed walking through the forest/green/flowers there as well."
,,Lot´s of fun,4.0,,"What a great experience it is this place. It has every kind of bird you can imagine. The only down part is the food price, but, you are there for the birds, not to have a meal."
,,Colourful ++ but hilly terrain,4.0,,"Beautiful, colourful birds from just about every continent. The park is very hilly, so small children or disabled may find it hard getting around."
,,Make sure you time your visit for one of the shows,4.0,,"The show makes this place.
It is simply fantastic, and worth the ticket price alone.
But a lot of the rest of the park is a little depressing - all the caged birds. But there is one part where you are in an enclosed canopy with them, which is excellent.
If you can make one of the shows, then go. Otherwise, perhaps don't."
,,Bring your own food!,2.0,,"The park itself is great with plenty to occupy both kids and adults for a good full day. My major grouse is the F&B options are limited, expensive and low quality, which pretty much spoiled our day. Not expecting gourmet food but $7.90 (SGD) for a hot dog in a bun is a rip off..as is microwave bowl of pasta with a few slices of sausage and tomato paste on top for $11-12 (SGD) and waffle with ice cream for $17 (SGD). Worse of all, there were only two miserable hotdogs left at 1 p.m. to feed my family of 4! What a shame to spoil the visitor experience this way!"
,,Kid's would defenitely love,3.0,,"The show in amphitheater was splendid. Watching them feed penguins also gave everyone a smile. The ride in train is ok, so is the world's biggest artificial waterfall. That's were the problem is as well, its all artificial, hence doesn't interest everyone. Lots of beautiful birds inside though."
,,Nice bird park!,4.0,,"We chose to visit the bird park travelling by public transport. It is very easy to travel on the MRT & then straight onto a bus that gets you right to the entrance of the bird park. The bird park has a very good variety of birds to view, but make sure to leave plenty of time as there is quite a bit of ground to cover & in the heat of Singapore you certainly don't want to be rushing."
,,Nice attraction for small kids,4.0,,There were many kinds of birds in the park. It is a bit sad when we saw big eagles and pure white owls were housed in not so big cages. They couldn't fly much in there. Other birds were lively and sharing open spaces with one another. It is worth visiting.
,,Great place for kids and adults,5.0,,Well worth a trip to see if you like birds or have family traveling with you. Would definitely go back for another visit
,,Be Aware Rip Off,2.0,,"I and my daughter were visiting Singa for 3 days. We had to choose among the several offers on what to do in the city. Unfortunately, we picked this park to go in one of the afternoons. They advertise in their website that the last ticket time is sold at 5:30PM, so we planned to go on the touristic bus in the morning, have lunch and than go on to Jurong in the afternoon. We arrived at the park at 4:30. No one ever told us that the performances (shows with the birds) end up between 2:30 and 4 PM daily. We paid full price - they do not offer a discount for afternoon comers - and we did not see any show whatsoever. Most of their performances with the birds are between 10 AM and 2:30 PM. Only one of them end at 4 PM. So, we got in and started being pushed by the employees that kept saying for us to take the tram asap as the park was getting ready to be closed. Why do you guys sell tickets after 2 PM than - I asked the manager who stood there without any answer. Why don't you guys inform people about the timing of the shows or maybe give them half a price tkts for those getting in after 2:30? He was unable to answer these questions and did not offer anything to make up for our loss.
Therefore, I advise you, if you decide to go, make sure you do it in the morning. If you can not go in the morning, DO NOT GO! Don't spend expensive dollars to not be able to see every attraction, or have to see it fast because the employees are pushing you saying they will close soon. For me, this was what we usually call a ripoff. Other than that, nothing special apart from the parrots that can be fed by food you can buy there.
Better use of our dollars!"
,,Sad Birds in Small Cages,2.0,,The birds are in small cages. Some of them had bleeding scrapes and scars on them. I wasn't impressed with this tourist place but it was another thing that was included in our i-venture card.
,,Worth a visit.,5.0,,I enjoyed visiting this place. Make sure to see the bird show. A voucher is included in Singapore Airlines Stop Over Holiday package.
,,Ok place,4.0,,It's ok place and not in my must visit list. It take long way to come here also. After MRT and then bus.
,,Most interesting for children,4.0,,Now it is old and need to add/modify shows. Bird feeding the most attractive for our grandchildren. Tram ride is good.
,,Lush,5.0,,"After visiting phuket and refusing to go to any animal parks ( since knowing how badly treated most are) I was looking forward to this park, it had been highly recommended by a friend. And I was not disappointed! First class enclosures for all birds. And how happy and healthy they are! The macaws and flamingos were my favourites. Amazing green foliage everywhere! Bonus was spotting some squirrels running around in the trees :)"
,,Excellent collections,5.0,,"Birds collections are really amazing. Plan your day at the park early in the morning..
Suggest to walk around for better experience. Look out for online reservations one or two days prior to the visit so that can get some good deals.

You can spend easily half a day over there until noon."
,,We really enjoyed the visit.,5.0,,"Spent a super day in the Bird Park. There is lots to see and it is well laid out. Do not forget your hat on a hot day. Birds are texans well cared for.

Catering not so good but hey we were there for the birds not the food. Easily found elsewhere on Singapore is the widest choice of food you will ever want."
,,Great way to spend a day,4.0,,"Obviously it is a great place to see birds, but it is set out so you can enjoy walking through different environs at your own pace. There is a great shuttle bus to take you around the park if you get tired of walking. Cafés in the precinct provide decent and reasonably priced food. Certainly worth a trip. Only issue we had was trying to leave at the end of the day and the taxi queue was not only long, but very very slow moving as taxis weren't inclined to come out so far."
,,Too Huge Park...,3.0,,"When we entered the park, we were full of excitement... There is a show of birds nearby the entry gate...it was awsome.. a nice ambience... we started walking and man..it was huge... there are obvious reasons why it is huge.. because of giving enough room to the birds to live.. but soon we got bored out of it... long walk to see a handful of good birds... The train was not operational... however..there was a long cart to help u avoid walking and quickly reach the some of the predefined destinations.. but the nmber of such carts are less... so u have to wait long for another cart to come to pick u...

so so experience..."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"My hubby is a bird lover, he has two gorgeous ones of his own, so this was a must for him...I was a little skeptical ! But I was pleasantly surprised this park was so beautiful and I had a lovely time. Lots to see and very educational."
,,A1,5.0,,"we departed the hotel with Tours east, the guide who was great Linda Chan (great sense of humour important) took us around the gardens and also caught the last part of one of the shows. very well laid out, lots of facilities :-)"
,,recommended,5.0,,highly recommended for kids and even to adults. the place got lots to show and it was beyond my expectation. my favourite is the nocturnal birds place :)
,,"Less featured as compared to the Zoo, but definitely worth a visit",4.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park has been mostly less featured as compared to the Zoo, but nevertheless, it should not be missed. The place is vibrant and colourful. The ""World of Darkness"" where Owls are being featured is amazing, the Lory Loft where one gets to feed the colorful small parrots. There is also a water play for the kids."
,,"not zoo, but close",5.0,,"If you are not paying attention you cand thnk you are on a zoo, but it's very close. We took the train and stop between the station and try to enjoy the place. It's very big. They have a show wiith different parrot - I didn't think I'll like it, but I do! They've done an amazing job. If you have kids they will love the experience."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"We travelled by train and a short bus ride to get here but it was worth it. The aviaries are huge (walk thru, multi-story huge) and amazing. There is even a huge waterfall in one of them. The shows are very entertaining. The birds are all easy to see, it's educational as well. Loved it."
,,Not as many birds as I had expected.,3.0,,I took the MRT then bus 251 straight to park. Coming back I walked under the big expressway and the bus stop going back to the MRT was there and took bus 251 back to it. I rode the tram around the park to get a feel for what I wanted to go back and see. I also went to the parrot show. It was a typical bird show. I saw one bird in the tall man made waterfall area. Overall out of everything I have done on this vacation this has been the least impressive for my money.
,,From a Jurong resident's perspective....,5.0,,"Some tripadvisors argued that the Bird Park should be closed as caging animals is bad. Yeah… I too like animals to roam free and I agree, no cage is big enough… So shall we set them all loose? Perhaps they'd go take a nibble off you? Oh wait… but it's my country's duty to protect visitors isn't it - even when some choose to stupidly rouse certain sensitive species on purpose… Singapore is safe, but not that way!

So maybe Singapore should have no zoo, no trade, no entertainment, no life… odds are the same lot of whiners will label us ""boring""… Seriously, these blind followers of ""rights"" and self-proclaimed wild-life enthusiasts, incapable of coming up with better workable ideas, best say nothing… and OMG did I read someone claimed Jurong ""forced"" him to buy water, when tap water in Singapore is portable? Hmm… Too lazy to do a little research or just plain dumb?

I have lived in Jurong for 20 years. We have way too many factories and HDB (government) residences here. I think the Bird Park is probably the place most worthy of a rather tedious train or bus journey to Jurong from other parts of Singapore. It is not very big, but an easy getaway from the miserable concrete surrounding Jurong. I like feeding the lorries. You can also chat with their care-givers, who would be happy to discuss their work and the birds they care for. Oh and I like the Bird Show (did I hear the righteous blinds protesting?)… Of course the birds are not circus animals, but they are probably better cared for than an average pet dog.

Those who think that the birds are unhappy can keep their assumptions. For 20 years, I have seen cranes out searching for food around our housing estates and the nearby Jurong Lake areas. These birds then return home to the Bird Park at dusk. Would they have set up home willingly in the Bird Park if the place feels horrible? Animals are very sensitive…

This is a park suitable for a family's day out. Of course the F&B is a bit costly - just like any touristy spot. So pack your own drinks and snacks. Wear comfortable clothes and footwear, don a hat and sunglasses, and maybe pack a small fan and flannel for sweat... and you're set :) Enjoy the Park."
,,The place is so clean and neatq and all the birds are interesting. My favorite is the flamingo part. They are so relaxi,5.0,,The place is so clean and neat and all the birds are interesting. My favorite is the flamingo part. They are so relaxing to be matched from afar
,,Exquisite,5.0,,If you love birds this is the place for you. There is a tram you can ride about in and some walking treks also. Be sure to see the show and the highest man made waterfall. Loved it!
,,Nice place for family with kids,4.0,,"Nice forest decoration, man-made waterfalls and variety of birds as well as bird show to enjoy. I'd rather recommend this place for family travelling with kids or bird lovers."
,,Lovely Park,5.0,,"Had been to this Jurong Bird Park at Singapore during Feb 14. It is a lovely park with lot of birds, fish, ducks etc...
Great Chance to see Hawks, Eagles, Vultures with hooked beaks.
Pleasure to watch Flamingos in their different style in Flamingos lake.
There are plenty of South American Toucans. Lories,Mandarin Ducks,Macaws,Riverine,secret Ibis (South American wading birds) different kinds of Penguins, Snowy Owl, Fish owl etc...
In the Swan lake, it is joyful to watch Black Swans and Muke Swans.
Tram ride is also available at a cost of SGD5 for going around the park.
Strollers and Wagons are available to children at a cost of SGD9 and SGD15 respectively.
Entrance fee is SGD25 for Adults and SGD6 for children.
We loved this Jurong Bird Park very much."
,,I love this place so much,5.0,,"Awesome birds. awesome place. If you visit all areas, you can't say that this bird park lacks something, i was 100% SATISFIED."
,,Fun for the family.,5.0,,Fantastic experience for kids. Bring along a swim suit for the kids as there is a free water park inside.
,,"Best park among all the zoos,parks I have visited",5.0,,"I happen to visit Jurong Bird park quite a long time back and I feel privileged to see and experience it. The bird shows are the best attraction here and I think that is the only reason it is so popular. Neat, clean, friendly staff and friendly birds of course. Do visit this please and you will be awestruck for sure. Loved it."
,,Park is good for one time,3.0,,"We arrived at bird Park in the morning after entrance we did some photos with parrots and there are 2 or 3 shows only and not much but the Falcon show is very good to watch and loved that show also if kids carry some swim suits as they have a small water play area like Splashers of water and kids love to go there also need some towels for kids.
the eggs hatching process we could not see as it's not regularly done which i wanted to show to my kids how does it take place overall it's OK"
,,Sensational!,5.0,,"In my opinion, a fabulous attraction to visit. I loved wandering amongst the birds. Fabulous photo opportunities. Loved watching the Lorys and Parrots eat their fruit. Plenty of weird and unusual birds too. Also, beautiful orchids! Plenty of walking, but so worth the effort!"
,,Amazing place.. Feed birds with your hands,5.0,,"A very amazing place. Most mind blowing part was the ""Lorry Loft"" the friendly Parrot like birds will happily sit on your hands to eat food. Must visit this place.

Huge variety of birds along with various shows including the outstanding talking/singing Parrot show. There is a tram ride for ease of traveling round the park. Ample food and Drink options.
A Must visit place while in Singapore.."
,,Nice bird park,5.0,,"Best place to see various birds and worth seeing. Children s will love this place. No need of Taxi to visit here Overall, the joy of this experience is unforgettable.Nice park but be prepared for a fair amount of walking"
,,Grt place,4.0,,Jurong Bird Santuary is a must visit p;ace in Singapore. With lots of birds we actaully wonder why we cannot so the same in India. The animal shows are just too good and it is a great family outing
,,The best bird park I ever go,5.0,,"In my opinion, this is the best bird park I ever visit. They manage this park very well. I love going to this park because I'm a photographer. They have many beautiful birds, such as flamingos, pelicans, eagle, mandarin ducks, parrots, etc. They have a interesting shows. You must watch the shows if you visit this place.
Recommended place to visit if you love birds. Reccomended if you're a photographer, visit Singapore with your family (especially if there'a a children in your family)."
,,Lively Place To Be With Birds,5.0,,Lots of activites to do. And a great place to watch different kind of birds. Will amaze you and everyone with you.
,,We enjoyed it,5.0,,"we (family of 4) visited Jurong bird park in July 2014. we enjoyed the park so much with its population of different birds big and small. we had the joy of hand feeding some birds and watching the great show at the amphitheatre. we took nice photos of the colourful birds and my daughter; who is into arts, had the chance of drawing live sketches of some of the birds. overall a great day out.

entry fee was SGD 25 per head and the taxi would take you there for SGD18."
,,Bird Park,5.0,,"Another enjoyable day in Singapore. Wow, it was amazing, loved the flamingos and the variety of different birds. A must do while in Singapore."
,,Many Beautiful Birds,5.0,,"I bought 3-in-1 park hoppers to visit Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and Bird Park, and I spent the whole day in both Singapore Zoo and Bird Park with husband and kids. Don't miss the bird show! If you go with kids, spend time on the water park too. They love water play."
,,Professional Managed Bird Park,5.0,,"By far ,this Jurong Bird Park is the best man made Bird Park we've ever visited.Clean ,pleasant atmosphere ,and professionally managed.
Prepare to walk a lot.Thin rain coats are available on many scattered shops here .
Opened daily from 9am to 6pm.Take the bus 194 or 251 from Boon Lay MRT.
Plan your visit here, from the brochure , because there's some feeding sessions and shows not to be missed.
The free fly aviaries are one of the best venue ,and the Flamingo lake was stunning!
2 visits already ,and cant wait to pay another visit !"
,,Worth Seeing,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park in Singapore is worth seeing. It is amazing to see the extent to which they have trained birds to perform before the audience.

If you are lucky, you can be selected by them to inter act with birds. They may ask you to give some money to bird. Dont worry. Mostly they return this money or give prize worth more.

Overall, the joy of this experience is unforgettable."
,,Great Park for birders,5.0,,There is a lot of uphill walking at this park. Most of the displays in natural settings. Good viewing for most. Imperial pigeons everywhere and nesting in trees.
,,Birds in cages,2.0,,"I had hoped that most of the birds would be in large aviaries. Whilst there were certainly some of these, they were mainly set up with cafés included. I found the sections with hornbills, birds of paradise, penguins and flamingoes depressing. The penguins in particular. Would not recommend to other wildlife enthusiasts. Ok if you want to entertain the kids."
,,GREAT PLACE FOR BIRD LOVERS,5.0,,It is an excellent place for bird lovers.I think this is the biggest bird park in the world.Singapore is the best place in the world for living and tourism also.Me and my friend enjoyed a lot in this park.It will take more than 6 hours to cover the park.
,,A scorching hot day,3.0,,Thank goodness for the tram ride as we could not have walked around this park the day we took our 3 year. Very clean and tidy quite a beautiful laid out park but go on a cooler day as even the birds were hiding - did enjoy it and some of the a varies are stunning.
,,"Same old, same old!",4.0,,"The last time I visited this bird park was about 8 years ago. My children were in their teens. Throughout their growing up years, this bird park was by far their favourite. They preferred this park over Disneyland or Seaworld! We have been here more than 6 times. This visit however was for my 6 year old nephew. Convinced my sis to visit singapore during the raya break. The park, the shows and their staff was still the same! Clean, professional and courteous. My sis was amazed and pleasant surprised. She promised her son that they will visit the park next year."
,,Pleasure to visit,5.0,,"Nice park but be prepared for a fair amount of walking. The show was a real treat, wonderful to see such well trained birds entertain the crowd, not to be missed. The enclosed area/aviary was otherwise the best part of the park."
,,Awesome bird show!,4.0,,"Regret missing King of the Skies show time but High Flyers is one of the main highlights in this bird park! A place that is nice to slowly walk around on foot, it will take about 3-4 hours to see most of the birds. I personally find the breeding center very informative and a great educational place for everyone!"
,,Well done to the Bird Trainers and the Bird Park!,4.0,,"Spent 4 hours at the Bird Park today and could go back again another day as we didn't see everything. Definitely have to check the bird show times - King of the Skies & High Flyers were the ones we saw. Well done and better than I expected - upbeat trainers and the show flows well. Impressive birds - Macaws, Toucans, Eagles, Owls, Flamingoes, etc! Reminds one of what wonderful animals they are. An area for kids to get wet and cool down from the sun so if you have children, be prepared. There is a hilly part to the park so if you are with persons who may have difficulty with walking, take a tram ride round first. Fantastic Bird Park!"
,,"Neat birds, expensive food, good tram ride",3.0,,"Jurong Bird Park was a neat experience to see many different types of birds. However, when we were there, there were a few that looked injured. A couple of the ""prehistoric"" birds had bloody heads. We also noticed that many birds were completely out of water and it was a hot day. Some event appeared to be panting. We took the tram ride around and that was good. We didn't buy any food because much of it was overpriced.

The Jurong Bird Park, SIngapore Zoo and the River Safari are all linked. We went to all three and it seemed like they had a 3 for 1 deal on some of the animals. They appeared at all parks. I would recommend selecting 2 of the 3 depending on your preferences."
,,Fantastic bird show,3.0,,"We spent about 4 hours here and think it was just right. After visiting the zoo, river safari and then night safari, I think we were all animaled out. The bird show was the highlight, my eldest son got picked to be one of the volunteers and was extremely happy. I recommend you sit towards the front if you can. Also the man made waterfall is a must see. I don't think it's an essential visit when you come to Singapore but if you are really into birds then I highly recommend it."
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"Easy to get there using the MRT & bus. When you go make sure that you see the bird performances, as you experience a wide range of birds flying above you. The flamingoes stole the show. The walk in aviaries allow you to see many different birds in their natural habitat. Well worth the visit."
,,Birds are nothing but Angels,5.0,,"Jurong Birdpark is a well maintained as well as an organised Bird park. Its a very fun-filled area. The begining itself it was nice, cos' they gave bird food and you know , the small birds came sat on shoulders , arms , it was nice.
Then there was timed bird shows which is a memorable experience."
,,Jurong Birds Park,4.0,,"You need half day to take a good round around the park. Ask the volunteers about the 'Bird's Show' timing and plan according. Tram ride is there in the park but take a full walk into the track which is worth. 'Bird's Show' will be for half an hour and its awesome, those volunteers really loves and care the birds you can see that, you also have option to pose with birds at the end of the show. Depending on the crowd there is a chance for 'Eagle Show', but I missed it."
,,bird show is the highlight,4.0,,"went to Jurong in the morning hours to see the High Flyers and HUNTING BIRDS show. It was fascinating to see how the birds were trained to perform acts. Loved the way ""Amigo"" parrot talked. there is a penguin feeding session too.
Firstly, on early enter, do take a tram/walk to visit exotic birds enroute and a Mini waterfall, parrot section. The birds are maintained in a friendly environment and do encounter a close contact with them.( esp parrots, peacock)
TIP - be early to the shows to get the best seats."
,,Must see bird lovers,4.0,,This place really needs more than a day to complete. But nevertheless main attractions can be completed in a day. Don't miss the shows. Lori loft too is not to be missed. Here you can feed the parrots and lorikeets. Flamingo pond is a spectacle to watch. Overall must see for birders and kids.
,,Variety is great!!,4.0,,"This is a good 3-4 hour thing and they have lots of birds from all over. You can either walk out out our take the tram, jump off at the stops to the birds. The park is very well kept and clean. The have a couple shows as well, which the kids might like. All in all pretty good.
Like in any zoo/park, you feel terrible that our forests are dwindling & to see these majestic birds in captivity is also heart-wrenching .."
,,Favorite place in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a top notch bird park. I just love the atmosphere, the variety of birds and the shows. If you're a bird lover, I think you'll really enjoy this park. Allow enough time to visit the many areas. It's helpful to know the show schedule in advance so you can plan your arrival and walking to catch most of the shows. There is a big gap of showtimes during the lunch hour, so if you arrive after 11, you'll be waiting around until the afternoon show cycle begins. There is a tram you can pay a bit extra for which was useful to hop on and off at each stop (one trip only), if you don't like walking up and down the slopes to get around the park. It was very, very hot and humid when we were there (I think that may be the norm) so be prepared for that. My favorite part is the Lory Loft, where you can buy a small cup of nectar to feed the birds. They will come over to you, land on your arm and drink from your hand. I have been to this park twice now, and if I go to Singapore again, I'd go back to the Jurong Bird Park again."
,,Pleasantly chirpy!,5.0,,"Do this attraction on foot if you can, it is well worth it. You can take your time and click ample pics and catch some of them in action chirping and fighting. The tram doesn't do justice to the place as you miss seeing a lot of birds. So take that walk and visit the souvenir shops....Great Tshirts and good quality souvenirs."
,,Very good park. Avoid tour operators,4.0,,"The park is simply one of the best bird parks. We were guided by local tour operators and their only aim was to rush us as much as possible, with the result that we saw more than 80% of the park only from the tram and got very little chance to alight and actually see the birds. We felt cheated, but there is very little one can do in such situations. My advice: do this trip on your own and take your own time. You will love it!"
,,Mindblowing!! Flabbergasting!!,5.0,,"I have traveled a bit of the world in my time and I am proud to say the Singapore as a whole took my breath away. Although it may come across as sterile and bland to many, the lack of spice itself was alluring to someone with a surfeit of spice in his life such as myself. The first place that I went to was the Jurong Bird Park and it was truly mindblowing. I am sure many from developed nations with wider experience would not savour the experience as much as I did, but for me it was fantastic. The sheer variety of birds and the extreme proximity from which you get to see them makes you feel dizzy with pleasure. being an avid nature lover I soaked in the artificial environment with considerable love as they had ensured that you did not feel like you were watching birds in a cave. In fact, there are huge waterfalls and enormous enclosures for the birds which all give the impression that you are indeed in the middle of a very believable sanctuary. The sheer number and variety of birds lends credit to the planners and the depth of planning itself. Some of the birds are such that you would rarely see them even in their natural habitat were you visit the place. You get to feed such birds right out of your hand and then sometimes get to touch them as well. Such is the magic of the place that old and young alike will fall in love."
,,Heaps of different birds,5.0,,We recently spent the afternoon here and thought it was nice...although it was a little upsetting seeing some of the birds in such small enclosures. There are a few good shows on during the day in which the birds get to fly around which is good. I would say you could easily spend 4-5 hours here. Also the shuttle from the city hotels is pretty good value with return tickets being SNG$10
,,Birds of a Feather,3.0,,"Best part of this, for us, was the Lorrie enclosure. It was almost as though the Lories knew we were Aussies. They landed on Hubbys shoulders and while we know they were enjoying licking the salt off his neck, the other tourists were in awe of the fact that he received so much attention from the birds that there are now hundreds of photos of him and the birds all over Asia lol
The other highlight was the bird shows themselves, for me in particular the Macaws in the shows...I love Macaws lol and had no Idea they were such agile aviators, totally awesome."
,,"If you love birds or nature it's a must, especially photographers.",5.0,,"Getting there. Taxi is the easiest and will cost about $12-15 from Orchard Rd area, dependant on time of day. I have heard public transport is a nightmare.
You can get a multiple pass incorporating the zoo and bird park or also the night safari, well worth doing if you are considering visiting more than one place. I am a bit of a fan of paying the extra $5 for the tram/train ticket as your feet can get sore and on a hot day it's nice to get driven around:-)

The park houses some magnificent birds, and has some very educational and well thought out shows that are worth watching. Try and make it to some of the keeper chats ( this is where the train ticket comes in handy so you can quickly wiz to one at the other side of the park then resume your viewing) as they are very relaxed and informative. There are several walk in aviaries that allow you to observe the birds in a very natural setting. As a teacher of wildlife photography I highly recommend places such as this to my students as they can hone their skills where there are many different types of birds that you still need to find and will fly away etc... But here they are a little more used to humans so you have more time to get your gear right :-)

A big draw card for many is the lory aviary where you walk around on walkways at tree
level and are able to feed the birds, who fly down to you. This is a big hit with the kids especially. Quick word of advice - the entrance to the aviary isn't really well marked and you have to go through the cafe to get to it. I wasn't the only one wandering around the outside looking for a way in! There is a tram stop at the main gate, the lory aviary and the waterfall aviary.

For me the waterfall aviary was the highlight. It wasn't there the last time I visited the park. It has a 30 m high waterfall and a myriad of birds flying around the huge enclosure. Some species love to have their photo taken but there are quite a few species most people never see, you will have to hunt for them. There is an upper viewing platform with a warning of steep climb, which puts most people off. It is worth the short walk as it's quiet and relaxing and you will see some of the shyer birds up there.

There is a nice cafe and shop inside the aviary and I heartily recommend this as the most relaxing place in the park to stop and catch you breath and have a cold drink or ice cream, the waterfall does help cool this down too. Just be prepared to share your your table with the occasional cheeky feathered friend!

Wheel chair and pram friendly in most places. The lory aviary has a platform anyone can access the rest of the walk has stairs or a hanging walkway. There is the standard children's our door water play area as well, like the zoo and gardens by the bay.

Give yourself quite a few hours to explore and enjoy."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"If your are a bird nut and are in Singapore, you must go to the bird park, it's amazing. The weirdest thing was finding that after travelling all over Europe, this was where we finally saw Puffins! A great place."
,,An enjoyable visit,3.0,,"We visited today...it's a very enjoyable family experience. We took a taxi from Clarke quay- it took about 20 minutes, and cost less than $20 fare. We had bought the 'hopper' 3 park passes - haven't been to the other parks yet. I'd recommend getting the tram at the bird park.....it was a very hot afternoon, and I don't think we'd have made it all the way around without the tram (tram is included with the passes I bought - or extra $5 at the park). Shows were very entertaining. Only problems we had were that the vending machines didn't have plain water, and that we had to wait about 25 minutes for a taxi to come by to get back to the city afterwards. That said, one of the staff very kindly got us some bottled water from the restaurant (after closing time) - he was extremely helpful. If you like zoos/ animal parks, it's well worth a visit."
,,Take your time at the Bird Park; you'll enjoy it better this way,4.0,,"I paid my second visit to Jurong Bird Park over the weekend with friends and it was a pleasant enough way to spend the better part of 4 hours. Although not exactly the easiest of places to get to via public transport, you can always opt to take a cab if you are travelling in a group.

The park is nicely laid out so that you can make a full circle and not miss any of the birds (unlike the Night Safari where you have the option of taking several trails) and for those who are tired, there is a paid tram ride that brings you to strategic stops all around the park. It was a rainy and cool morning, so my friends and I opted to walk. You can probably cover the park under 2 hours without much stopping and spend another 40 mins taking in the performance shows, which are quite entertaining. Little ones and those young at heart can cool off at the Birdz of Play wet & dry playground and spend even more time at the park.

Some of my favorite stops are the flamingo pond, pelican cove, lory loft and the waterfall aviary as these are large open air structures and look closer to the birds' natural habitat. Some of the other enclosures were a bit distressing for me as it seemed as though the birds were cooped up (especially for the larger ones like the hornbills, toucans and the magnificent eagles/hawks/vultures) in areas that simply didn't allow them to fly more than a few feet at a time. While I do admit that the park does the best it can in keeping the birds healthy and tries to provide as much as possible, it still seems rather sad.

Upkeep wise the Jurong Bird Park is not a new attraction like the River Safari and its age shows. The caged enclosures are not new, some parts appears to be rusting and it feels a bit run down, especially when you look at the now derelict monorail(?) station.

Overall, if you haven't been to the bird park before, it's not a bad way to spend half a day, even as a local tourist."
,,Beautiful Birds from around the world,5.0,,"We purchased a package which included entry into the Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari and the Jurong bird park, it was the best value. We took a cab from Harbour front and it only took around 15 - 20 mins and cost $14. The park was very well set out, we decided to walk around the park before taking the tram ride as you get to see everything that way. We watched the bird show with some beautiful birds then walked through this amazing aviary where the birds were flying around you and the species were plenty and very colorful, took lots of photos as these birds were not behind cages. Another great spot for photos was in the Lory enclosure they also flew around free and you could even feed them by hand. The giant waterfall area was another great place for photos, lots of unusual birds to spot along the way and there is a show inside as well. We ended our visit on the tram for a well earned rest after walking around for hours. All up it was an excellent day we spent around 4 hrs there, it was a very hot day so I suggest you take plenty of water and even a face washer to keep you cool, the park is not just for kids if you enjoy nature, it was just me and my husband and we enjoyed it."
,,Bird Paradise,4.0,,"With over 5,000 birds and the largest walk-in aviary, bird shows, plants and trees, a must see for bird lovers of all ages."
,,Out of the World Experinece - Nice Shows,5.0,,"We went to the bird park but we were late to reach there as afternoons can be a bit hot .
I was checking the tickets on line and we got a free pass for kids on purchase of an adult ticket .
Saved us a lot of time .

If you are more than 3 or more people ist always advised to go to any attraction by your self in a Taxi rather than the group tour .

The bird park was fanatastic and the information it gave us about the the kind of birds available was really good . Dont forget to buy a tram ticket and you can travel as many times after 2.00 P.M else you would tire yourself .

We saw two shows one at 4.00 and other 5.00 P.M and it was really a breathtaking experienece .The kids had a great time and one of my daughters was called to particpate where she a won a small gift as a bottle fo Coke . It was not a matter of what she got but the way she enjoyed and performed with the Birds .

We as elders would have give definatley a Miss incase our kids wouldnt have been around . I should thank them that becos of them I saw them

Its a Really nice experience and one SHOULDNT MISS it .Will recommend this to everyone ."
,,the best bird park we have seen till date,5.0,,"we were travelling in a group 6 adults and 6 kids all below 10 years .they were really happy to see the birds the park has .you can see them from such a close distance..many of the birds are rare ones which you would not get to see often..
also there is a 100 feet man made water fall which is worth to visit and close to that there are bird feeding stations and also 4 bird watching points .so if you have time and loves bird watching in a peaceful quiet environment do visit this place with ample time..."
,,Great Park for Kids,5.0,,"The Park got a collection of birds from all over the world, good shows and very informative, great place for children to learn about different birds from gigantic to the smallest species."
,,Amazing birds,4.0,,Such an assortment of birds to watch. The surrounding natural environment was also stunning. Watched the high flyer show which was great. Spent about 4 hours there was probably enough time to get around the whole park.
,,Impressive bird show!,4.0,,The bird show was very impressive but other than that it was OK... The tram ride took us quickly around otherwise I wouldn't have had the patience to stroll through the park...
,,Great place for kids and adults,5.0,,"A huge array of birds with easy access. A tram (hop on/hop off) is idilic to get around. Fabulous spot, a great family tourist thing to do."
,,It's a birds world after all!,3.0,,Not very accessible to public transport. Admission fee is affordable. Spend about half a day to totally enjoy the whole Bird Park experience including paid trips and tram rides overlooking the park. Free maps provided for DIY walk trips. Various animal shows are scheduled so check it out or miss it. (visited March 2011)
,,Very Colorful Birds,5.0,,"there was so many colorful birds never seen before in my life. You must do this when u are in singapore. It will take entire day, carry food, water, nuts (it comes in handy). Weathr is hot as well, o make sure u have caps and stuff."
,,Terribly humid but surprisingly shady,4.0,,"I started my day early knowing that the sun will be unforgiving by 11am, it was interesting to see the birds behaving differently in the cool of the morning compared to the heat of the mid day sun. I really loved the hawk show, the owls were so cool! Lunch with the parrots was interesting as Picasso the macaw was so happy drawing pictures! Food was terrible though, standards can be better for the $22 I paid. The owl attraction was a bust as there was a loud tour group that spoilt the experience, they were so loud that I left before my eyes adjusted to the dark. There was a kids section where young ones or young at heart can bring your wet suits and play in the water, the big bucket that periodically emptied itself is an interesting feature. My Mom and myself enjoyed ourselves with the wide variety of birds and had fun with the different shows. It was a memorable trip, even with the miserable heat!"
,,Lovely day with the Birds,4.0,,"Given the blistering Singaporean weather, I was dreading the visit to Jurong Bird park. Walk around in 33 degree humidity, to look at birds? No way. But my daughter insisted and I am glad that she did. It was a surprisingly Good!

While it was hot, the park has abundant tree cover and many exhibits are partially enclosed. A tram ride is included in the ticket price, so its possible to hop on & off from three central stations. We didn't though, as the shows and keeper events are thoughtfully paced, and we could easily stroll from one venue to another.

We'd pre-checked the website for show times and decided to visit on a Monday morning & catch the first 10 AM show. Good move, as it was relatively cooler, less crowded and we were able to see all events. By 2:30 pm we had covered everything - exhausted but happy.

Short notes:
* We had 'Lunch with the Parrots'. The show was nice but it came with a $22 price tag for a mediocre buffet. Not really worth it, especially since we'd seen the High Flyers show, where the same parrots performed as part of a larger act.
* The park is located far from the city center. Local transit goes directly into the park, but it'll be a minimum 90 minute trip.
* Remember to bring mosquito repellent. I forgot and have the itchy welts to prove it."
,,Best for kids as well as adults,5.0,,"I have visited jurong bird park after 5 years once again. It's still awsome, morning shows are very knowledgeable for kids as well as fir adults and very entertaining. Feeding of penguin are very intersting and Kids love to feed penguins. Second show which shows the habitat and parade of toucan, parrot, macaw nd flemingo are amazing. It's a great place to visit fir both adults and kids. But you should have your own transport or good knowledge about transport otherwise may have difficult journey. Best to get a package tour.which covers other places too then you don't have to worry about transport too.very friendly staff and people around. Very nice place to visit."
,,"Impaired Excellence, Uneven Curatorship",4.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park delivers both an aesthetic and educational experience almost despite itself. Easily overlooked is the status of the park as a de facto botanical garden. It includes, for example, one of the world's largest collections of heliconia flowers. Its spectacular hillside setting disposes visitors to a favorable impression and comes close to suggesting a tropical paradise. Also highly laudatory is the extensiveness of the bird ensemble, which includes a full range of tropical species such as hornbills and toucans while also covering less obvious crowd-pleasers such as blue crowned pigeons. The collection of parrots and macaws is likewise nothing short of spectacular. That having been said, an assortment of obstacles blocks the full enjoyment of the natural wonders at Jurong. There are far too many ""shows"" and ""theaters"" that offer uninformative bird stunts and that are too juvenile in their level and orientation. Many of the enclosures--especially for the macaws and parrots--seem too confining: too geometric, too square, too regular. The walk-through aviaries provide a better environment, but those displays are in the minority. The tram ride is utterly useless; the park can be easily traversed on foot in less than half an hour, and the sound-track on the tram, which features a hysterical quasi-British voice worthy of a Mr. Bean movie, provides nothing other than shrill enthusiasms of zero educational value. The Jurong Bird Park is definitely a must-see. It succeeds almost despite itself owing to the marvels that it houses. But it is certainly time for the updating of some of the exhibits--and for the elimination of ridiculous anthropocentrisms such as the taking of pricy family pictures with (pestered) birds."
,,A very beautiful place,4.0,,"I found the Jurong Bird Park experience really enriching. There is a lot to see and the experience can't get better. The bird feeding sessions were really fun as we got to see a lot more birds than we usually would have. Don't miss the High Flyer show as it really enjoyable. I really loved the Penguin Coast, the Birds of Prey the Dinosaur Descendants and the World of Darkness.

Apart from a tram ride, I suggest walking the whole trail once to experience the animals. The Bird Discovery Centre is really informative.

It is totally worth a visit. For a slightly more detailed experience see the link http://nehaslife.wordpress.com/2014/06/11/singapore-thailand-trip-jurong-bird-park-and-wonder-full/"
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,Must see place in singapore. Bird feeding sessions are fun! Very convenient and we'll managed. Many shows are organised throughout the day! Kids love it!
,,"After 30 years, so much have changed.",4.0,,"It has been almost 30 years since I last visited teh bird park.

So much has changed and it ie for the better.

To me, it is not easy to reach there as it is not near to the train station. However if you want to have just a walk at the park, choose a weekday as it is more quiet.

The birds inside is quite nice especially those in the aviary. I think they are doing some upgrading work so that you can be nearer to the birds in the aviary.

The bird show is actually quite entertaining. You should not miss it."
,,Lovely and enriching tourist's attraction,4.0,,"I am rather proud of SIngapore's Jurong Bird Park and must admit it is my favorite tourist's attraction by far.

Besides being an Omithilogist's dream collection of different species of birds, I like how this natural habitat has other facilities that make it feel closer to nature, and goes beyond just exhibitions and exhibitions of caged birds. There are also other exciting programs such as bird feeding, shows, dining with birds and photography with birds sessions etc.

An example of one of those ""facilities"" would be this long drawbridge and we were able to glance down and see birds flying acoss / by / below us; one could also feed lory birds here.

The waterfalls was, and still is my most memorable and enjoyable spot in Jurong Bird Park - giving the place blasts of cool air and scenic view. In the past they had the ""dry ice"" mist there, adding a touch of mystic to the falls, but I didn't get that during today's visit.

There are also many different species and types of birds all housed in their cages or are allowed to fly around in a designated enclosed space. It was very educational and enriching - some of these birds are really adorable and gorgeous. I got to see my favorite swans as well.

The bird shows were fabulous too - the parrots were so smart - could draw, fetch objects and perform. All in all it was an entertaining day well-spent!

,,Bird Show,3.0,,"WE went to see the Bird Show at Jurong Park, and it wasnt bad. My partner really enjoyed the show since it was her first time watching a bird show, but I have seen better in Malaysia & in Thailand. But for kids, its a must see."
,,Surprised at how much we enjoyed this!,5.0,,"We took my parents who are visiting from the US and I knew they wouldn't be able to handle a long day there so we go there around 3:15pm, just in time for the penguin feeding and the birds of prey show. Then we took the tram around once, and then walked back around once looking more closely at the birds. It was actually really great and my husband and I kept saying we need to come back here more often and just walk around. One of our favorites was the Lory area - the Lories loved my Dad and were happy to perch on his head. I would highly recommend this for anyone - families with kids, adults on their own, anyone really - very enjoyable and totally worth the price of admission. We ended up staying just about 3 hours, but if you and your companions have the stamina you could definitely make a longer day of it. Of course, because it's Singapore, it is hot and muggy, so you need to factor that in."
,,Fun + Knowledge,5.0,,"The reason I like this park is because it combines fun and knowledge. You will see a lot of exotic species of birds from around the world. You get involved with them in feeding sessions. The two shows - one involving exotic birds and the other involving killer birds are a great fun! You can easily spend half a day of a unique kind of fun.
If you are using public transport then alight at Boon Lay MRT station and catch bus # 194.
Also, to save some money buy a 2-in-1 or 3-in-1 or a 4-in-1 ticket covering a combination of Bird Park, Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari."
,,Excellent to see Jurong Bird park,5.0,,"I visited Jurong Bird park after more than a decade and was amazed to see them maintain the quality of the place and the events. The entertainment value of the shows was up there for what could otherwise have been just like any other zoo, walking around and seeing birds in cages. Even for the birds in cages, you get to see them up close, in open enclosures sometimes and the feeling is amazing. Great 1 day outing for a family with the kids not getting bored."
,,Can't believe I underestimated this place!,4.0,,"I am normally NOT a big fan of birds. I used to find them boring and only good for colourful feathers. But not until I visited this place recently.

Basically it is like going to a zoo, so this one is like a bird zoo.The exhibits of a myriad of bird species were not only fascinating, they were also simply educational. And arranged in a systematic way so that it is easy for a visitor to associate the groups of birds one is looking at and learn about them.

Very child-friendly and disabled-friendly with many facilities provided. Crowd is a non-issue because of the way they design the park, where people who hate crowds and large noisy families/groups can choose to walk a different path.

Many interesting events like bird feeding and bird shows. My personal favourite is Breeding Centre, where you can watch how they manage breeding programme and how they take care of vulnerable chicks.

Location is a little tricky though. It is located within the industrial part of Singapore. Good thing they have shuttle bus system."
,,Top attraction,5.0,,Expect a 30min cab ride from city but worth it. The biggest bird park in the world and just fantastic The tram ride was perfect for hot weather Expect a lot of walking around wear comfy shoes The shows were fabulous and worth scheduling
,,One of our very favorite places in the world,5.0,,"One of the nice things about this park is that it is very easy to get to on your own. We have been to Singapore 4 times and every time we have visited the bird park, because it is always fun, and it is so big that we end up with a different emphasis on what we see each time. We had forgotten that the park opens at 8 AM, and got there too late to take in the shows, which are excellent. Our emphasis this time was on the hornbills and toucans. The hornbills are a lot of fun to watch, and this time we were able to see some of them nesting. At the time of our visit they had been in a state of drought for 3 months, and it showed in the vegetation. But the entrance, with its gorgeous blooming orchids was still gorgeous, and their collection of Heliconias (similar to bird of paradise) is still beautiful, too. The penguin exhibit is great, as is the birds of southeast Asia. We never get tired of visiting the Jurong Bird Park, and recommend visiting it if you like birds at all. Be sure not to miss the shows if you go."
,,Absolutely Amazing - A Must,5.0,,this was such an amazing experience with the kids..the brids were all friendly and we could come close and feed some of them...we watched the bird show..the park is beautiful and has the tallest man-made waterfalls..i absolutely loved it...
,,The excellent place to enjoy with birds,5.0,,"The place is quite far from the city but you certainly cannot miss it during your stay in Singapore. It contains many birds including Penguins,Eagles,Hawks and other birds. There are many shows round the day. You can also participate in them .You can feed them and also can have lunch with them . You must certainly go there. There is a huge variety of birds."
,,Nice,3.0,,"This place is just lovely, really beautiful zoo. I loved the part where you can feed the little parrots, it was simply amazing. But to be hotest without this detail, I wouldnt say this was worth 25$.
Two things I didnt like:
1) the show you can see are not good at all. They are made for kids. No info, just a big loud show. I had a headache from that noise, I cannot imagine how it must be for the birds.
2) very few info about the birds they have in the park. I would appreciate more details about the the life of the birds, how long they live, where they live etc.
what I really liked was the fact that all the birds have pretty big houses and that you can walk in some aviary with the birds.
Cannot imagine this park during weekends, must be crazy with all the kids :D"
,,Needs an overhaul,3.0,,"I loved visiting the park when i was a kid, and i remember bringing my nephews and nieces when they were kids. So I brought my kid when he turned 18 months and is at the age where he can recognize some of the species he saw in books. Most enclosures/exhibits have not changed much. The tram i enjoyed very much is gone, and i think the park is in dire need of upgrade. Especially toilets and diaper changing facilities. 3 of the toilets i visited only had 2 cubicles and aren't well maintained. It would be good if there are more facilities for family with younger children, like hot water dispenser, breastfeeding room etc.The park is generally stroller friendly and it is easier to get around. We caught Kings of the Skies show, and the authorities really should look into expanding the seating area.There were visitors sitting on steps and that could be potentially dangerous in case of emergency.

Food is generally overpriced so prepare your own if you don't want to pay $3.50 for bottle of 100Plus. Parents with toddlers/babies, please remember your mosquito patches/insect repellent. I went home with at least 20 bites and my son 5 to 6 huge ones on his legs. The Water Play area looks really fun, but it was too crowded and too hot we didn't get to try."
,,Fabulous!,5.0,,What a wonderful place to visit. Every conceivable bird you can think of resides at this park. The shows were excellent and the scarlet ibis was the highlight! Great for the kids!
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"It was a wonderful experience visiting the bird park. Though it is not very big, it has a wide variety of birds and activities through out the day. Especially their waterfall area is quite amazing. Peacock spreads his tail as if to pose of your photograph. Many of the birds are not very afraid of humans (seem to have got used to the visitors). They also have lot of birds in big cages. Overall, if you are a bird enthusiast or one with small kids, you will have a nice time here."
,,Must go place for bird lovers..,4.0,,"Want to hear the chirping of the beautiful colourful birds , this is the place to be. Beautifully maintained aviaries, the park is unique in itself. It's worth visiting. ."
,,Going down hill,3.0,,"We have been visiting the park for over 10 years and it is getting worse. Piece by piece all the things that made it unique are going and more and more of the exhibits are being obscured by do fine mesh fencing making it difficult to see them. The lorikeet loft has always been our favourite, but half of the walkways were closed for repairs on the day we visited.

There is not enough choice of food and drink and no where at all to have a proper sit down meal with service.

Tickets are 25 Sgd. The bus (#194) from Boon Lay met is 1.5SGD each way."
,,A bird park in true sense,4.0,,The park is scattered over a large area with a variety of birds present with various bird show the price of the ticket is 25$ (SGD) and their is also an option of taking a tram ride which will give a overlook of the park tram tickets costa 5$.
,,Decent experience,3.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is located near the Jurong Hill, which is somewhat far away from the heart of the city. I and my wife got to the place using the MRT and then a connecting bus, without a hassle.

There are some wonderful aspects to the park, in terms of the open sanctuaries of birds like Mackaws, Hornbills, Flamingos, Ostriches among others. Do not miss the High Flyers show, the highlights of which were the speaking parrot and the grand finale (where all kinds of birds are on the stage). We also witnessed the Kings of the Skies show, which was average at best.

Our favorite part about the park was the Lory Loft, full of colorful little lories. For SGD 3, one can feed them right of one's hands.

Now the not so good part; large parts of the park still have the old style cages, through which one can hardly see the birds. That was a bit of a dampener for us.

Overall, a decent experience for the 3 odd hours spent at the Jurong Bird Park."
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,The shows here are a wonderful way to know the talented birds. They are so colorful and so beautiful that you shall want to be there for a long time. The shows are must visit.
,,First time visitor,4.0,,I spent a half a day here and I was amazed at the varieties and species of birds here from around the world. The shows were ok but the 2 aviaries were amazing. The shows were ok but the two aviaries were just amazing. fantastic photo ops.
,,Birds of jurong,5.0,,Very interesting...don't daily to watch the two bird show...they have a new show featuring the vultures...the high flyers show should never be missed...people of all ages enjoyed the antics of the birds...
,,Amazing birdshow,4.0,,"A must visit when you are in singapore, kids will love the birdshow and the varieties of birds is amazing. Family friendly event people of all ages will love everything"
,,Well planned..,5.0,,"We were on a six hours guided tour,which was well planned,the place is well maintained,clean,and has nice bird shows.."
,,A must watch park...,4.0,,"first and foremost... reach early and be willing to spend some time....
take the free flyers available and plan accordingly to watch the shows... some smart planning will let you watch all the shows or you may miss them. if you miss one, then the next show happens much later only. only 2 shows a day.

The eagle show starts at 10 am.... then proceed to the penguin show (11 am).... and then head straight for the bird show... and only then hop onto the tram service.... the tram will take you all around and feel free to alight anywhere you want and enjoy up close... or else you can continue your journey and have a quick tour of all the park."
,,Timings not co-ordinated,3.0,,"Singapore jurong bird park hasnt changed much in 6 years since i first visited it.bird show is the same with a little bit of variations and the timings of shows should have been better co-ordinated to catch them instead of running for them.The water stunts show was hilarious and try getting seats in slightle wet area if u do not mind a bit of splash.Else it was average, thailand experiance was much better."
,,Reach early or you will rue the missed shows.,4.0,,"My friends told me to reach there by 10 still I reached there around 10.40 only to be told that first show starts at 10. The first show of Wild Birds I missed which has second show at 4PM only and there isn't much to do till then. The Second show is at 11 and its repeat is at 3PM. So we watched only the second show. But boy, they are fun. Also there is a water park there for small children. So if you have small children with you take some extra dresses for them and let them enjoy water park.

Penguins and Owl cages are very good and so are the open sanctuaries of birds. Cant say same for old styled cages where you can hardly see birds."
,,Really impressed when I didn't expect to be,5.0,,"Two adults and 5 year old visited on Easter Saturday morning. Loved it. Was quite crowded, but not ridiculously so. The tram was included in our ticket (3-in-1 park hopper) and Jurong Bird Park is really good value. There were lots of birds that we'd never seen before (eg. flamingos) and quite a wide variety of birds to see. The two shows are highly entertaining and quite educational and there is plenty of seating - each show takes about 20 mins. The 5yo was not interested in the Breeding and Research Centre, but older kids might enjoy it, and the adults in our party did.

The kids dry and wet play areas are great. The 5 yo LOVED them - especially the wet area. Perfect to cool down around lunchtime. The showers & toilets were quite clean. The play areas would probably only suit kids up to the age of about 6 or 7.

The food options are limited and a bit pricey (SGD32 for hotdog, two grilled vege sandwiches/rolls and three drinks), but no more than you'd expect for a tourist attraction. It is good value to get in, but they try to gouge you at every opportunity - many photographers trying to sell photos (starting price SGD35 for one photo)!

If you have mobility issues, this park might not suit. It has some steep (though short) hills that would be difficult to get around in a wheelchair, but the tram is an option. If you stick to only exhibits near the tram stops, you won't see everything.

We stayed there about 4 hours and saw a bit of everything, but it is a place you could easily take your time at and spend the whole day.

Wear a hat and sunscreen, as you're mostly outdoors. There are lots of stagnant water areas, so would also recommend insect repellent.

We took taxis to and from our hotel in central Singapore (near Bras Basah MRT) - cost around SGD17 each way. There was about a 20 min wait early afternoon for a taxi, but the taxi ride itself was only about 15 - 20mins each way."
,,Waited for years to visit,3.0,,"I had waited for years to visit. In the meantime I'd been to many bird parks around the world. I love my birds, I studied Bird Biology extra murally via Cornell Ornithology Lab - we are twitchers.

When I got here I was a little underwhelmed. I agree with previous posters - there are a lot of old style cages in places. There aren't that many walk in aviaries compared to other parks (KL Bird Park has been the best in my experience).

The conservation boards in the parrot section were good and got my kids talking about extinction and how that occurs.

The ostriches looked really sad. The enclosure needs a serious rethink. Don't get me started on the penguins, the enclosure was crowded and had no enrichment for the poor birds. If you want to see good penguin enclosures go to Sea World in San Diego as a starting point.

The bird show was fun, I did get to take part which was a dream for me. However there was little if any conservation message in the show and it did focus mainly on large parrots.

There's an extra charge for the 'train' around the park - given the ticket price it could have been included.

So I got my dream - to go to Jurong. We came away after half a day and went to the Singapore Science Museum. That museum was recommended by a taxi driver and it turned into the real highlight of the day."
,,For the bird lovers,3.0,,"Confession: I have lived in Singapore for 20+ years and this is the first time I visited this attraction. Apparently, I did not miss anything much. Must admit that I am not impressed. Compared to the other animal attractions (mainly Zoo, River safari and Night safari), I think this is the worse. Unless you are a bird lover, you can give this place a miss.

Went there on a weekend and its not as crowded as expected (mostly tourists) so plenty of space to enjoy the exhibits. I suspect the place is deserted on weekdays (other than the occasional tourists groups).

Location: at the far west end of Singapore. Far from city and practically in the middle of nowhere. If you are traveling with toddlers/infants/old folks, take a cab and bring along the strollers/wheelchairs. easiest way to reach the place.

Accessibility: stroller and wheelchair friendly. They offer stroller rental for $5 and free wheelchair rental. Skip the $5 tram ride if you are carrying stroller/wheelchair coz there is no place to store them on board. I walked all the way, good exercise when you are pushing stroller.

Food & drinks: tourist price (basically 3X the normal price). You can consider bringing your own food and drinks to save money. Bring a lot of water to keep yourself hydrated.

Weather: This is Singapore, so the only weather are hot and dry or hot and wet. Check the weather forecast for rain. 99% of the exhibits are open air so if it rains, you cannot see anything. There are plenty of shelters though. wear comfortable clothing (shorts, quick dry t-shirt, sandals or good walking shoes). You WILL perspire. Sunblock and sunglasses are great too.

Must see: Penguin exhibit at the entrance and the 2 shows. You can check the timing in their website and make sure you don't miss them (http://www.birdpark.com.sg/shows-feedings/show-times.html)

Enjoy your trip."
,,Where you can meet penguin,5.0,,"Well, I don't have to travel to Antarctica to meet the real penguins after visit Jurong Bird Park. But not only penguin, I can see so many bird that maybe in a lifetime I don't have a chance like the Paradise birds.
This also is a great place to teach your kids about nature.

The things I don't like much is they don't have much choice for eating. So you better bring your own food. By the way, to visit the whole park, you should take a day, do not buy the combo with River Safari."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,I would agree that Jurong Bird Park is one of the best bird park if not the world's best. I have read some negative comments about this park here but after all I really enjoyed the visit and didn't even notice that they charged something ridiculous for drinking water (maybe I had my own water).. The park is great and the collection of birds is just enormous. Go and see it with your own eyes.
,,Birds of Prey,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a place that you can view different type of Birds of Prey in Singapore. The Park is very clean and have shelter all along the way. We love to view the Bird Show and is very attractive, especially when the Birds flew down to the platform just above your head. Transport is very convenient either by bus or taxi from Boon Lay MRT Station."
,,Amazing Bird Park,5.0,,"My 3 year old kid enjoyed very much in this bird park. Especially the Penguins

Don't miss the shows. You have the opportunity to take pictures holding the birds. Check the timings for the same.

Take only taxi to reach this place, its faster otherwise you will end up wasting more than an hour from city to this place."
,,Best Bird Park,5.0,,"The park is huge with various areas and a great variety of birds and habitats. While some of the birds unfortunately don't look too happy in small cages, others seem to have enough space to walk or swim around. There is so much to see there - a visit to the park can easily take half a day. The aviary dome is probably the most interesting part and of course don't miss feeding of the lories in their loft :-)!"
,,Needs to be closed - with one exception,2.0,,"This is a deplorable old-fashioned park where birds are kept in the least acceptable types of enclosures. It needs to be closed. Unfortunately, western tourists pour through the gates to get photographed with exotic species, believing they are interacting with wildlife.

They aren't.

There is one magnificent exception to this - the waterfall aviary. This is spectacular, and provides a real environment for many species to flourish in.

Note: Jurong is one of the few places in SG to force you to buy water. They have made sure to keep drinking fountains to a minimum. Be wary as they charge a premium."
,,Great for the twitchers out there!,4.0,,"OK this place is basically a bird lovers dream come true.

Jurong Bird Park is out of the city centre so you'd be best having your transport researched and/or organised. Secondly like everything in Singapore it isn't the cheapest.

But those two points aside this is a nicely spaced out bird park with a number of aviaries. There were a whole range of very unusual birds (to me at least) and so if ornithology is you thing then this is your place.

Many birds are in enclosures that are not the huge aviaries style so be ready for that.

Lastly there are plenty of amenities and some quite entertaining shows put on by the birds that the kids will love.

Recommended to get out of the high rise area of Singapore to see."
,,A magnificent display of birds,5.0,,"If you love birds or even just like and appreciate them then this place is a must see. The grounds are stunning with easy access to all areas. There is a train that travels around the park to save your legs for a while. We suggest you visit the park by yourself not in a tour as this allows you as much time as you want to look around. ( we have done it both ways in the last few years and it was much better this time on our own) We caught the MRT to Boon Lay station and then a bus to he Bird Park- this is easy to do and cheap too. Alternatively there are taxis which are reasonably priced in Singapore.
So many birds from flamingoes, macaws and toucans being my favourites."
,,I love Bird Park,5.0,,"This is the second time I have been to Jurong Bird Park. We visited the bird park from Singapore zoo, we caught a taxi from the zoo to get to the bird park to save time travelling. Entry to the bird park is wonderful, there are arches of orchids in all types of colours. The free flight aviary section of the bird park is fun and interesting to see all the different types of birds.

The bird flight show is also cool to see."
,,It was awesome,5.0,,Jurong bird park is very massive and impressive place . We really enjoyed. Even for me it was very interesting as i'm bird watching person. Next time i'll visit again.
,,One of its kind,5.0,,Visited the bird park around 10 AM & spend almost four to five hours ther.It was an awesome & memorable experience along with the birds over there watching & feeding them.My daughter loved each & every moment inside the jurong bird park.
,,Ok ok place,2.0,,"Birds are mostly caged. Lorry loft was nice. If you have already seen lot of different parrots and pelicans some where else, you can give this place a miss. If you come here then please don't miss the High Flyers Show. The show was not very spectacular but if you are in the park you should not miss it. We visited the entire place within 3.5 hours by walk. Nearest MRT is Boon Lay and you can take a bus from there to bird park. It took us 50 minutes to reach bird park from Farrer Park MRT using MRT and bus."
,,Family with young children,3.0,,"Just ignore the visit time. We visited this bird park when the kids are small age few years ago. The park is big and you won't feel bored with its bird show on certain time. However, I think we came once is more than enough. Suitable for family with young kids."
,,Went to Bird Park early morning,5.0,,"Saw a number of non-resident birds, loitering around Bird Park premises.

The friendly staff explained about a bird couple who were busy nesting.

During the Bird Show, a flight of birds above our heads made me giddy with excitement.

I love the macaws - a very healthy and noisy bunch."
,,"Beautiful, colorful place",5.0,,"A beautiful place with many types of birds. A good place to go for a family outing. For a photography lover, it's paradise... you can spend ages there and still want more. It's quite big, so does get very tiring as you walk around the whole day. If you visit the place, you must go for all the shows."
,,Stinky,3.0,,"It is super stinky urrrrrg, bring your mask before you come inside. anyway it is a nice place for birds lovers"
,,Spectacular Better than Zoo,5.0,,"This is one of the must visit places of Singapore. It is more enjoyable than the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari as we get to see so many types of birds. The entire section dedicated to the Parrot family is great in particular.
The natural environment and beauty inside the park is remarkable.
Also the LORY bird feeding is not to be missed. You have parrots feeding nectar from a cup in your hands and also sit on your shoulder and you can experience birds very closely.

Must Visit and have memories for a lifetime."
,,A Must for Bird Lovers,5.0,,"My husband and I are fascinated by the beauty and variety of birds so this was our top attraction in Singapore. The enclosures for the birds are roomy and the photographic opportunities for the spectators are excellent. We spent several hours there and could have stayed longer. Don't miss the bird show in the amphitheatre. It's very entertaining and a real spectacle. We loved it. If you want lunch, there are cafes just outside the park and you can go back in afterwards. Don't forget to take an umbrella."
,,Very good,4.0,,"A great day for my kid. No complaints, bit pricey that's all. Food was unhealthy at Bongo. Photos were $6o for two. For one adult and one child, entry, photo, taxi both ways and a small snack $150."
,,Must Visit tour with Family,5.0,,One of the best way to put you with the natural habitat of Birds. Very educative for children specially where you get to feed the birds and interact with them. The bird show is worth watching and love the High Flyers show.
,,There are beautiful birds,4.0,,"The fee is too high as most of the other attractions of Singapore. Too far from Singapore zoo . However, Beautiful location and environment. Taken the highest advantage of the land."
,,Beautiful Birds and the park,4.0,,"We reached the park around 2.00 pm after visiting the zoo. I do not think that is the best time to visit a bird park. although we wanted to visit bird park early the service provider first went to the zoo and later drop us at the bird park.
This is created in a very nice environment and they have taken the maximum advantage of its natural conditions. We must appreciate the creativity of them.
The Tram ride was very useful for us to explore the park with the limited time we had ( The Tour company dropped us there around 2.30 pm and wanted to pick us at 4.45 pm to go to night safari.)
Hence we could not watch any shows of the high flyers or what ever.
The Lori Loft was very nice place. The colorful birds are very friendly they will come to your hand if you have some food. So they provide some bird food at S$ 3.00 to feed the bird and will take the photograph too.
I think the best way to visit JBP is on your own. Take the Green Line MRT and get down at Joo Koon the last station. Then take a bus to the Bird Park. as early as possible. Then you can watch lot of birds and also save your time to visit other places. Also this may be the cheapest way to visit all attractions.
But most of the tourists search the assistance of the tour companies without knowing."
,,Wholesome place to visit for all ages,4.0,,Love this place..Wide variety of beautiful bird species.Don't miss the Lory Loft where you get to feed the birds and interact with them..its fun! The bird show is worth watching and love the High Flyers show most. Very entertaining and educational for kids and adults alike.
,,Beautiful Birds found here :),3.0,,"Beautiful birds to interact with and daily feeding shows along the way. It was nice to see the Pelicans & Flamingos in open air, free to roam, migrate or whatever but it was disappointing to see birds without freedom locked behind cages. That shouldn't be allowed, and the park should be transformed into a conservatory/sanctuary 100% open air free to come and go (for the birds) and not be a zoo. At first we started on the left path thru all the caged animals/birds and were disappinted and later passed through open air free to roam birds such as the pelicans and flamingos and were much happier"
,,A Great Day Out,5.0,,"This is a really well organised park with plenty to amuse young children as well as an excellent selection of bird species. There are restaurants, well signposted pathways and a water park although you will need a change of dry clothes."
,,Amazing Park-like Setting and Fabulous Array of Bird Life,4.0,,"While visiting family in Singapore we finally ""ticked-off"" the Jurong Bird Park. As it was a teachers-only day at school we took the grandsons with us and they really loved the place.

You can either see the birds on foot (wide clean paths) or take the transport (train) provided. We chose to walk. The Pink Pelicans were a definite hit with the children. They look so feminine and graceful. The boys loved the Eagles and the little sand area close-by where they could pretend to be archeologists by brushing sand off bones from (supposedly) the pre-historic era. What cool distraction for the children and a chance for us to take a seat and rest the feet). The Lory Loft, the world's largest free-flight aviary was spectacular and the Waterfall Aviary is also a ""must see.

Because of the water shortage in Singapore, the water park was closed .. this really disappointed the boys who were keen to cool off after a couple of hours of running around checking out the numerous exhibits.

A great place to take children - well laid out and really informative."
,,The best collection of birds..and very interactive,5.0,,"Awesome...must see...take Ew line to Boon lay and 194 from interchange.....the tram ride may be worth .aDo not miss lory loft where you buy bird feed and birds actually fly to you and feed from your bowl perching on your shoulders or hands...then the waterfall is also beautiful....the toucans and pelicans are awesome.The bird show is pretty different though I saw many of them in the past. Now my food tip for vegetarian s. You get great veg biryani for 8.5 sgd with curd, mixed veg kurma and dal....at the restaurant opposite bongo burgers."
,,Very colouful display of avifauna,5.0,,"If you are in Jurong and you like birds, this is the place to be! I like taking photos of shapely birds strutting their stuff. The trouble is I am too impatient to wait for those pesky wild birds to sit in the right spot.

In my view its much more fun than the zoo or the night safari as you can get so much closer to birds in a natural environment."
,,Mindblowing,5.0,,The park is awesome. Do not miss the bird show near the entrance. Take a walk around the park and enjoy proximity to nature. You can feed the birds and enjoy the serene atmosphere.
,,Amazed!,4.0,,"I really enjoyed my visit to the Jurong Bird Park.

I went with two of my friends to visit Singapore. We decided to ditch the typical Orchard and Clarke Quay journey for a more ""natural"" visit. So off we went to Jurong without the slightest idea of what was ahead of us.

Getting there was very easy. It would be very good if you purchase the tourist day pass at the airport (it really helps alot since you don't have to carry cash around).

Jurong was very impressive!!! I didn't know that avian could be so entertaining!!! All kinds of birds from the beautiful flamingos, noisy macaw, adorable penguins to the mysterious owl, you name it all. The signage, although short, was quite informative.

One note though, if you have some allergic reaction or just very sensitive to feathers, you really have to take this into consideration. My poor friend kept sneezing after we were there for a few hours. But all in all, we had fun there."
,,Good for a weekend day out,4.0,,The park is relatively smaller than Singapore Zoo. It's good for family and children since they'll be entertained and learn a lot from the shows and exhibits. You can bring along some snacks and cookies to feed the parrots as well.
,,Be in paradise amongst exotic birds,5.0,,"Where can you find more than 400 species of birds; many of them roaming and flying freely. See how hatchlings are nutured into adults.Be the first to vounteer during the lovely shows and carry pictures of lifetime with eagles, vultures, hawks, parrots flying and sitting on your forearm"
,,"Great Aviaries, but too many cages",3.0,,"I love photography and was looking forward to up close images of birds I wouldn't have the opportunity to photograph otherwise. I THOUGHT the park was basically ALL aviaries, giving the birds at least some freedom. While there were some aviaries, there were MANY birds in cages which, in many cases, seemed far too small for the species.

It is a delight to walk among the lorikeets and other birds. The manmade waterfall, with birds was really quite good.

A tram goes around the entire park, with 3 stops. However, in order to see all the exhibits you do have to walk a fair bit. Note that you will need to walk up a steep hill and down the other side."
,,Healthy displays,5.0,,"My first visit for 25 years. Great to see a good idea develop into a world class attraction. Particularly impressive are the hornbill and Bird of Paradise areas, and the owls were also well presented with several species to see. Penguin exhibit was a little tired. Very hilly site needs some fitness to negotiate but tram available. Rainforest aviary is magnificent, and was able to observe the Taraco at close range for some time."
,,A must for bird lovers,4.0,,"Greatly maintained, with a great collection of birds, mostly kept in great condidtions. The only thing I didn't like is the arctic bird area. It's small and rather poor. Better not to have it at all than to keep penguins in such conditions. Other than that it's a five star attraction."
,,Go in the morning,4.0,,"One should visit the Jurong Bird Park early in the morning. The birds are more active, feeding and the weather more pleasant (it gets too hot in the afternoon). You need to walk quite a bit to get up close to see the birds, so don't waste money on tram rides. Water coolers and washrooms are conveniently available.The following are worth seeing:
10 am King of the Skies show with owls, eagles, vultures, hawks
11 am High Flyers show with singing parrots, cockatoos, flamingos, hornbills
11 45 am Hornbill chit-chat
2 pm Pelican chit-chat

Although it is quite sad to see lots of birds behind cages, many of them are still free to roam. There is a large group of pelicans and blue crowned pigeons which surprisingly were friendly enough to walk right up to us. Birds are hard to get close to in the wild let alone spot in the forest so seeing them so close is indeed a treat. One new addition which I find very educational is the Bird Discovery Centre. There is a whole room with several glass panels where you can see on display the egg incubation process, several month old chicks growing inside controlled environment, types of food the chicks are handfed with, etc. To those people who try to force feed the poor over fed lories, please stop and leave them alone."
,,Worth to spend a day,4.0,,"I went here alone, quite easy to get here. I forgot which bus should i take (get lost is a must :D) prepare your best camera because many things are worth to be captured. if you travel solo, 2-3 hours are more than enough."
,,Good for a day / half day trip,4.0,,"They have some good shows here. Dont miss the High Flyers show. The King of Skies show was ok.

The waterfall aviary is open only till 2.30 pm, so ensure you go in the morning if you dont want to miss it. I missed it during my visit."
,,"spend a whole day, come closer to nature..",5.0,,fantastic place for nature lovers. very-very wide variety of birds to be seen. we went around noon and couldn't cover whole of it. bring water and food to avoid spending extra.
,,Good Experience,5.0,,"Lots of good reviews are already written about this place and i found out that all are true.

Lots and lots of birds and few other animals too. People of all age have something to look into.

Very much crowded during holidays and too huge complex. You might need to take the train sometime. Bird feeding was the best."
,,Birds of all types,3.0,,"This is hard going when it is very hot and humid. The tram is $5 extra and is well worth it. It is on the side of a hill, so one side of the loop is uphill. We wanted to see some of the birds closer, so walked around a bit. It was miserably hot. Also, we have more lorikeets in our yard in Australia than we saw here."
,,Fantastic collection of birds,5.0,,Great day spent at Jurong seeing their collection of birds. Their shows were 'fantastic'. Very well put and enjoyable experience. They have a tram going around for those needing to rest their weary legs or not in a position to use them well. Loved it! A 'must do' thing when in Singapore.
,,Great experience - though tough time finding transport back,4.0,,"It's fairly hard to write a review of a bird park - it's just that. Full of birds. Many of them. All different colours. I would recommend it if you have done all the other main attractions, and are wanting to fill in time. The shows were great - definitely do not miss those.

However, we found that the taxi-stand was a bit useless. Perhaps it was the day we decided to visit (the day before Chinese New Year), or maybe it's normal - but I would say it pays to arrange your transport back before you get there. We waited over an hour and a half in the taxi stall."
,,A great place to visit with good shows!,4.0,,"If you have time during your visit in Singapore, I would recommend to go to this place if you love Birds!! Bring your kids as well to enjoy various kind of show during the day. Please check the show time before going there as you can plan which show you want to see. At least 3-hour but I rather say a half-day tour would be perfect.

Bring your own drink as everything in this place is a bit expensive as it is a tourist attraction."
,,A different but nice experience.,4.0,,"This place is quite a nice hang out for family with kids & elders. More like a picnic spot.
First, one has to appreciate the effort taken to put up something like this. So many species of birds in one place. Including 'birds of paradise'. So the effort has to be lauded for sure.
The place has been maintained very well. The restrooms, the number of snack outlets, etc speak for themselves. I could see some remarks stating that this place is 'missable' & 'nothing great'. I don't agree. Birds generally tend to stop breeding & many die if kept in captivity. However, most of the birds in Jurong bird park appear to beat this trend.
Hornbills, eagles, vultures, kingfishers (different types), flamingos, varieties of pigeons, birds of paradise, orioles, cardinals, barbets, storks, egrets, parakeets, cuckoos, Asian blue bird, Magpie, Bulbuls, penguins, Ibis, Balinese mynah, peacock, ducks, pelicans, Lorikeet, Cinnamon headed green pigeon, varities of wagtail, Cockatoo, Swamphen, Moorhen, Pitta, Leafbirds, Shrikes, Monarchs, Laughing thrush, Chinese flycatcher, Starlings, Warblers, Toucans, Munias are some of the birds one can find.
One would need almost 6-7 hours to cover the entire park. The shows may be good for children. If you dont prefer it, then visit the 'rare' birds cage when the shows are ON. They feed the birds there (worms) & u can easily spot the rare birds coming by.
The place is quite far. One has to take an MTR and then a bus. If you are in a group, then taxi is a better bet. The taxi queue for return journey is quite long. But the longest one need to wait for the taxi is not greater than 25-30 mts.
The plants have grown inside the cages quite a bit and it sort of hinders the bird view. And quite a few hornbill/toucan cages are so tall and bushy that sighting the birds is arduous.
Nevertheless this place is a must see if one visits SG."
,,A Great Park,5.0,,"I am a bird lover and this park was a great place to observe a huge variety of wonderful feathered creatures. The shows were terrific and educational. The displays were likewise outstanding. It is a bit difficult to get to this park as one can do so by taking the MRT and then grabbing a bus. Of course, taxis are quite reasonably priced and are always a viable option as well. However you choose to get there, you won't be sorry as it will be a fun day."
,,What a fun-filled day you will have...,5.0,,"Lots to do, for you and the kids, especially if you love birds! Bring your camera - incredible opportunities for great shots! Lots to see - you can walk or you can take the little ""train"" and get off along the way of you want....I loved it!"
,,A must not miss if you are in Singapore and are a bird lover.,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a bit interesting to get to. The easiest way is to take the mrt up to boon lay station and take a taxi or bus from there to the park (taxi cost me $5.40). Once you are there, you could easily spend a whole day taking in the various shows throughout the day and having a look at all the various birds that are held at the
park. It's definitely somewhere to take the kids for most of a day, just don't forget your water as like most tourist attractions, the price is marked up."
,,Lovely place to spend an afternoon,4.0,,"It was a very large and open space with many different species. Clean, well kept and a very good deal if you buy the Singapore tourist card!"
,,Nice one for bird lovers,4.0,,I'm not so fond of birds but when you visit this park you might fall in love with the so beauty and colorful birds all over the park. There are 2 shows around the afternoon hours which should not be missed on your visits. In the king of the skies you will be able to see huge birds so closely and they fly all over you an amazing for the kids and they would love it.
,,Excellent Bird Park in the world!,5.0,,"Very thank you Jurong Bird Park Singapore! You brought us a perfect time to relax and a bird world. This Bird park is located near the bus stop, go to the Boon Lay Mrt and catch the bus 194 to there, very convenient right?!"
,,A very unique one.....,5.0,,"this is a v unique world where u can c 5,000 birds across 400 species fly,swim n roam freely in their natural habitats.u can feed,touch n feel them.above all there r two shows--high flyers show n king of the skies.both r v good n exciting.this is a total family fun time.this is one of the main attractions of singapore which one should not miss.it has an entry ticket n food is also available."
,,"Jurong Bird Park, Singapore",5.0,,"I enjoyed a visit to the Jurong Bird Park, one of the most natural and largest bird parks i have seen. I enjoyed going to two shows,the ""High Fliers"" and "" King of the skies"" shows; please check the show timings on arrival. The presenters and their birds gave a top class performance.The number of visitors at the shows was very impressive. The tram ""train"" with running commentary, which circulates at regular intervals is a boon for foot weary visitors. Times all year round 08:30 to 18:00."
,,Amazing Bird Park,5.0,,"Well maintained bird park. You can ride the train for one point to another point around the park. The birds were alocated in very organized area. You will not get lost in this park, you can easily found the information that you need. You can take foto with birds in front area for free. Still in front area, you will found penguin area, you can take a rest in here because the building equiped with air conditioning. There is a restaurant just in front of flamingo lake, what a view. You can enjoy your meal acompanied by birds show."
,,Amazing bird show..,5.0,,"Excellent show for children, young, elders, parents and even for grand parents to enjoy. Birds are well trained to perform. You can view show clips on you tube as well, however live performance rocks. Highly recommended to anybody and everybody."
,,Too good but the AC train is shut down for like forever...,5.0,,"Went to Jurong Bird park again, enjoyed it a lot again but sadly I came to know that the AC train which used to run on top to see the entire park from top view has been shut down from last 2 years, it is a big setback for me at least as the train used to give a very awesome view on the entire park with 4 different stations so it would also be used to go from one point to another in the park, now tram is the only option for travelling inside the park after walking of cpurse, kind of not happy, and apart from that everything was good, in the owls and eagles show the guy always (Yes always) picks a girl so if you are a male don't bother to even try, yes it sounds funny but also true. Lory loft was amazing as always. Total u need more than 5 hours to see all the shows and cover entire park."
,,Excellent bird park!,5.0,,"I'm not a big one for these sorts of parks and zoos as I've seen some poor ones in my time and I don't like seeing animals in small cages but my partner wanted to take bird photos and after reading the reviews, we thought we'd give it a try.

I was really impressed! There are so many birds with no cages at all that can just fly from one place to another if they want. The walk through aviaries are excellent. We spent 6 hours walking around and could have spent more.

The shows are great and a nice pit stop while walking around. The park seems to really look after their birds and I love that.

Tip, the park opens at 8.30am. We arrived at opening time on a Friday and for the first hour and a half we only saw 2 other tourists. It felt like we had the whole place to ourselves! It's also a bit cooler. I would recommend getting there early if you can."
,,Love Singapore but this attraction is for when you have exhausted everything else,3.0,,"Out of the main tourist area, ok easy by taxi or train but is it worth the journey?? Not in my opinion. Yes you see some birds but I really can not see the value in this attraction but it is something different if you have exhausted all other options! unlike one contributor I can not agree that it is better than the zoo but that is a matter of personal opinion. Not a place I would recommend you spend your money."
,,Day with birds,5.0,,Best part is that you can choose whether you like to walk the nature or take a leisurely tram ride....I did both & both having different charm.....liked the parrots sitting on hand & enjoying the feeding. Go & spend whole day at your pace
,,Gone to the Birds,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park, great to see so many species of birds in such excellent surroundings. Highlight is the Lorkeet house where the birds fly around an 8 storey high rain Forrest enclosure.A little tricky to easily travel there directly as it's located in a more industrial area, but taxis are very affordable to get there and there's a well managed taxi queuing system for your return journey"
,,A real treat!!,5.0,,"Especially if you are a bird lover and are conservation conscious, The Jurong bird Park is a must. It is set in beautiful lush gardens and well sign posted. There is a very large variety of birds from all from the east and quite a few from the rest of the world. They are all in lovely enclosures with plenty of space and foliage , but are still visible. All the birds we saw were in good condition and didn't appear to be stressed at all.There are plenty on good exhibitions, static and interactive during which conservation is always promoted. Thank you Singapore for once again giving us something interesting to visit, along with the Night Safari and the River Safari and that is just as far as animals are concerned!!"
,,"""Wonderful Bird Park""",4.0,,"I happened to visit this Park with my family. It is a wonderful bird park with neatly laid inner roads housed in a vast area, with greenery & shade everywhere. It is spic & span with no trace of trash, in spite of innumerable visitors visiting it. One can see different kinds of birds in magnificent colours, which are a feast to the eyes. Here & there small ponds with water gushing from fountains, colourful birds chirping unmindful of the disturbance of visitors,is soothing to the eyes. Further, there are small eateries in different areas to take care of your hunger & for taking rest. Children will love the environment & for young lovers, no better place to get lost, For the weak & aged people who cannot walk, they need not get disappointed. There is a battery operated train, which will take you around the park and you can get down at different spots & hop in at the next vehicle and you will not miss the enjoyment with your family & children. There is a bottle tree, which is in the shape of a bottle. Another attraction for small children is a water play area, where they can play and splash water, with attractively painted colourful swings & rides etc. It is not a swimming pool, but much more than that. It was a pleasant experience visiting this park. While a full day is not enough to enjoy it,one would like to visit it again & again. There is much to learn for other similar parks, in so far as its management,maintenance & upkeep is concerned. All the best."
,,"Better than the zoo, great place to see great birds",5.0,,"Often overlooked in favour of the zoo and various safaris the Bird Park is well worth a visit. Not only can you see more of the birds but you can get closer in various enormous avaries.

There are some quite wonderful and different species of birds that can be seen around the park. Try to get there early in the morning as it gets busy and be prepared for walks as there is so much to see and the birds obviously need their space.

There are also some nice children's play areas and events that demonstrate what bird of prey do and feeding time which is always fun.

Great for kids of all ages this is a great day out in Singapore."
,,An attraction - but would the RSPB approve?,3.0,,"We last went there many, many years ago - just after the MRT to Boon Lay had opened. Then it was more of a novelty as at that time Singapore still didn't go in for tourist attractions much. We accepted it for what it was - lots of cages with special feeding time shows and a couple of demonstrations.
We have just been again. It must have tripled in size. Much of it is a triumph of successful captive bird management but sadly, some of it is an absolute disaster and an exercise in State controlled self satisfaction - ""We've done this because we can"".
First - to get there - use the MRT East West line to Boon Lay and then get a bus or a taxi. The bus station is well organised and you will be quickly pointed at one of the two routes that go there. But a taxi is only about S$10. Go early - as all the best feeding sessions and demonstrations are in the morning.
As to be expected in this country, it's all well organised, mapped and signposted and to get round the lot will take more than half a day. The various snack kiosks and the main cafeteria are reasonable and acceptable - not brilliant but OK.
The good bits? Well credit where it's due - the huge free flying, walk round aviaries which cater for forest, ground and woodland birds and also for parrots etc - in fact those birds which are happy in the wild to live in a limited habitat or range - these are excellent. Especially the tropical forest aviary which has a 100 foot waterfall inside it!
The open bird areas, mainly based around ponds, with aquatic birds, ground birds and non-fliers such as emus - where clipped flight feathers keep them, sort of, in place - these were acceptable and on par with other bird parks we've been to. But even in these, is where you begin to see what is wrong. I imagine that the flamingos are happy enough to always live around the same pond but pelicans? Not so sure.
The bad bits? I'll save the worst till last - but first, the admittedly big cages housing the raptors and other birds of prey were simply inadequate by modern acceptable bird park standards. We happened to walk past them whilst they were being fed - the birds, totally listless and disinterested, looked down at the offerings as if to say ""well, I didn't catch it, why should I bother?""
There were other bird groups where cage size has been determined by available space, not the birds requirements, even allowing that some species should be held captive at all, even if it is for survival breeding.
But the disaster? Who, in their right mind would try to enclose penguins (including big ones), puffins and wandering ocean flyers such as guillemots and terns in what is effectively a very large cold room with no sky or horizon and no live prey? As I said - no thought has gone into this - just an exercise in self gratification by the humans running it.
So - if you want to take your kids to see lots of pretty birds, big birds, funny looking birds and dangerous looking birds, without thinking too much about it - then you'll have an interesting day out. But as I said - there is a lot of this place that the Bird Protection Societies ought not to be happy about."
,,Worth a Visit once with Kids when in Singapore,3.0,,"Jurong Bird park is worth a visit with your little kids.They would love the shows at the bird park.I suggest a morning trip for the bird park if you are visiting in December.Unfortuantely for us it rained half an hour after we reached there.....but it was a nice visit.
Please don't forget to carry your rain gear umbrellas and raincoat if you visit Singapore in December as it rains mostly towards the evenings.
The umbrellas and rainwear is pretty expensive in the Bird park to buy im talking S$15 for an umbrella.
There is a small water park inside the bird park for children so do carry your swimsuits for your children to enjoy the water park.
Do not forget your stroller and prams please.There is lots of walking that you have to do in here.
You do get prams for rental here but then i guess its better you have your own.
If you don;t feel like walking you can also get into the free buggy of the Jurong bird park which takes you around the park."
,,Outdtanding,5.0,,Outstanding. Easily the best bird park that I have visited. Allow at least 3 hours. Very good value.
,,"Awesome, but not as awesome as I remember!",4.0,,"First visited Jurong Bird Park in 1999. It was an incredible experience that I never forgot. Fast forward 15 years and I took my family of six (kids 13, 12, 10, 5) there in January 2014.

It was still a great place but just not as nice as I remember it. The waterfall enclosure was almost desolate of staff and upkeep. I couldn't tell if the enclosure had just matured from the last time I saw it or became run down. There weren't many birds in there. It was still a good place to visit. The waterfall (man made) is still very nice.

The hornbill enclosures don't offer very good views of the hornbills. The cages need a better design.

The Lorry Loft enclosure was AWESOME! Our kids and mom/dad LOVED feeding the birds! We bought the nectar cups and were not disappointed! This was the single highlight of the park! Can't say enough about it! Just beautiful.

We saw both shows and were quite impressed with the High Flyer's show. The show's are definitely worth your time. It's awesome to watch the staff demonstrate the bird's various abilities.

We enjoyed this park and would go again."
,,"If you are not fond of birds, you will fall in love for them when you visit Jurong Bird Park",5.0,,"The beauty of touring any locations in Singapore is its organized and well connected public transport systems.
Plan your trip to Jurong for a whole day, starting early morning. There are direct Bus services picking tourists from different key locations of the city. There is no direct MRT ( train) to Jurong but there are bus services connecting Jurong Bird Park with the nearest MRT. Another option is the self drive or cab to Jurong, which will be more expensive.
Jurong has birds from all around the world, from the Arctic & Antarctic to South American and African Jungles. The number varieties, shades and sizes of parrots and cucckadoo only is just amazing.
The best attraction by far has to be the bird shows. Check for the schedules and plan your tour accordingly. And if possible try every type of shows.

You can all your queries and infos from the website of the bird park: http://www.birdpark.com.sg/

When in Singapore don't just miss Jurong Bird Park."
,,Boring!!,3.0,,Except the bird shows everything else is very boring.. no interactive activities in any section.. ..
,,excellent interaction with nature,5.0,,"We spent about 6 hours in the park and it was worth it. For school going children it is even more attractive since they will correlate it to their lessons. Well maintained, neat and clean. The highlight was the special show - in the auditorium. Seating is well planned and some of the acts performed by the birds are really good, Place a large parade of birds at the end. The waterfall and the fully covered aviary is something different and worth seeing. Definitely a place for a family visit."
,,Beautyful place,5.0,,"Very nice park, full of exotic birds. A good idea for a half day trip when staying in Singapur! Nice is the Show with aras and other birds!"
,,"Beautiful, great day out.",4.0,,"Wow! Waterfall, rivers, lakes, so many birds/plants examples of nature's beauty and majesty. Tram ride is great, can get off and explore new worlds. Lunch with parrots wasn't what we expected, but interesting. Cheeky tip: you can view show from outside the gate once the show starts, without paying S$20 for buffet lunch (which was very yummy with enough vegetarian options that I was most satisfied) I was sad to see such majestic birds as bald eagles in small cages for their species, but they do get out to exercise and show off. Snowy owl stole my heart, stunning! This was a day well spent, interesting, enlightening, enriching. See if you can spot the massive iguana in the middle island on the right of tram ride :)"
,,Very beautiful,4.0,,"The bird park is quite big and has a large variety of birds. They have been categorized in areas as parrots, birds of prey, toucan, flamingos and ofcourse the penguins... There is also a large waterfall which looks absolutely marvelous with birds flying all around

There are few live shows which we missed unfortunately as we were in some other part of the park. However, pls do note the timings of these shows and make sure you reach the spot to enjoy the live shows

P.S - There are various combo offers which can give you access to all 4 attractions namely Jurong Bird park, Singapore Zoo, River Safari & Night Safari at a better rate. The Singapore Zoo, River Safari & Night Safari are in the same premises whereas the Jurong Bird park is at a distance of 20 kms hence covering all 4 parks in a single day is virtually impossible. Choose your combo passes wisely"
,,A whole new world,5.0,,"The best thing I liked about all the Singapore wildlife attractions is the keen attention given to showcase their wildlife in their natural habitat, causing them minimum trouble and at the same time entertaining people. The bird park is no exception to this fact! the amazing collection of birds at this more than 40 year old park is amazing. The park is well organized. The shows are excellent. Considering its hilly terrain, be prepared to walk! and also give the park around 5-6 hours to enjoy leisurely. the variety is amazing. only one thing we felt could have been better is having a bigger aviary for the hawks and vultures. considering their wing span the cages are very small. and these are birds which need to fly!! hope they will do something about this in the future. the waterfall aviary is awesome. sitting at one place you can literally see at least 30 different species of birds. the whole place is a rain forest area themed.
so a must visit at leisure pace. don't rush it.
good connectivity by public transport. not to worry. nearest other attraction is the Singapore science center. best option is to take a taxi ride, approx. SGD7.50."
,,Hang on to your hats,4.0,,"What a way to end a peaceful and relaxing walk through a fascinating bird park by enjoying the ""Birds of Prey"" live show. Hawks, kestrels, eagles, vultures and owls take centre stage whooshing above the audience. An amazing live spectacular in the open air guaranteed to enthral everyone. Do not miss it when visiting the park. Make your own way there and meander through the bird park or take the tram around the park from point to point. Unfortunately we took a tour to the park and rushed from enclosure to enclosure and missed out on another live show. Our 2 hour tour at the park was just not long enough. These shows were covered by the entrance fee."
,,One of its kind,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore and feel that you have connection with nature then without any hesitation, this is the place to visit. The most vivid collection of birds, including the rare and exotic types could be viewed in close proximity. The bus service is regular to this bird park. Among the top attraction is the bird show. DO NOT MISS IT. It is definitely one of its kind. In fact, the entire bird park is altogether different world. A great learning experience, it gives with the knowledge on such wide variety of birds."
,,Beautiful Birds!,5.0,,"The best thing I liked about all the Singapore wildlife attractions is the keen attention given to showcase their wildlife in their natural habitat, causing them minimum trouble and at the same time entertaining people. Jurong Bird Park, which I believe is more than 40 years old, is no exception to this fact. The journey to reach the park is a bit long as you have to get down at the Boon Lay MRT station and take a 15-20 minute bus ride to Jurong bird park from there.

Barring the long journey to reach the park, the entire experience with the birds is an experience to cherish. We bought the 3 in 1 hopper ticket which gave us discounted prices of the Jurong Bird park, Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari, just on one ticket. Just like the Night safari and the Zoo, there are trams in the park which is a good option for those who are too tired to walk down the park. However, it is advisable to explore the park on foot as some of these feathered creatures can be difficult to spot. There's Lorry Loft which is a visual delight as scores of colourful lories ascend near you. Feeding the lories is something which you just cannot miss as you can have the exciting experience of feeding the lories with your hands. This can also be an amazing photo opportunity as well. The Macaws, Owls, Hornbills, Ostriches, Penguins and other exotic birds are well kept and enjoyable to watch. The 100ft water fall inside the Bird park is another beauty which is touted as the tallest man made waterfall in an aviary.

They also have the High Flyers show and the Birds of Preys shows which is a delight, especially for the younger ones. If you are lucky, you can be chosen as a volunteer to see the birds show off their skills, up close and personal. Food options are limited here but it is okay to carry your own food, as long as you do not litter the place. The park is not very big and can be done in a matter of 3-4 hours. It is advisable to check the show timings before reaching the park so as to save on time. Also, do pray that the rains do not play spoilsport."
,,Perfect Escape!,3.0,,"Went there couple of years ago but come again with my young son ;)
Still good but some of the birds are gone.

Lory Loft, gone missing..no more attraction of birds we can touch and feed freely. The bird park should do something about it!
Anyway, still one of the best parks in Singapore."
,,One for the Singapore bucket list,5.0,,"This definitely should go on any visitor to Singapore's itinerary.

Located outside of the city, it can be a track to get there - I recommend the MRT and bus if conscious of money, else a taxi can get you there in about half an hour.

There is a large variety of birds to see and a number of shows - birds of prey is my favourite - through the day.

If planning to do he zoo or night safari, get a multi-park pass to save some $$$"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,We had a good time at the Jurong bird park and took wonderful pictures. Beautiful park to see a variety of beautiful birds.
,,Exotic Bird Sanctuary,5.0,,"I was really impressed by the variety of birds they have at Jurong Bird Park. I also enjoyed the ""high flyers"" show and the ""king of the skies"" show. To add on, the staff and student volunteers there are very professional and friendly."
,,Colorful and active,4.0,,"Quite a variety of birds of show, and a few opportunities for a photo op.

Book online for the Lunch with Parrots, it secures seats, and you pay when you are there. Great system.

Only downside is their cages are very thick and close bars, and quite hinderous to viewing. No doubt many of the birds are escape artists, but the cage walls are much more visually impairing than bird parks elsewhere in the world."
,,excellent bird park,5.0,,This is one of the top attractions in Singapore. I found it even more fascinating than the Singapore Zoo. Huge collection of birds/variety and excellent shows. You can feed the birds which makes it a more engaging experience. The waterfall aviary is quite impressive too.
,,Great bird park,4.0,,"Nice experience. Loved the natural settings the park has invested in and researched. Loved the breed and research centre, great learning experience and I think a world class set-up! Was a bit disappointed with the kings of the skies show (birds of prey) . Marketed well but did not live up to expectations esp for the horse part of the show. Thought the high flyers show was better even though I am a fan of birds of prey. Other then that great experience and friendly and professional staff."
,,World's Best Bird Park,5.0,,"This is to be seen but make sure to get there at 8am when it first opens... not 9am when it is more convenient for the tour companies! Make sure to follow the schedule of the feedings & shows. Bird of Prey show has suffered much decline in recent years but is still worth seeing.

This is suitable for all to enjoy, young & old!!!"
,,Great day out,5.0,,"Amazing bird park with several daily shows in different areas, and a grrat water oark play area fir the kids.

Plan to get there either early morning or later in the afternoon to coordinate with show times. Middle of the day is very hot, so go to water park if you have kids.

Plane for atleast 3 here, plus 30 mins travel time each way."
,,"Jurong Bird Park, Singapore",5.0,,"My wife Aruna and I travelled to Singapore in August 2013 and spent a week there hosted by niece Sunanda and her husband Gaurav, who live in Spring Grove Apartments on Grange Road. The River Cruise along Singapore River was a most fascinating experience and offered comprehensive sight-seeing. So was the city tour on a Tourism Department bus. Besides, we also visited Sentosa Island and the Jurong Bird Sanctuary, the latter providing a window into an exotic and colourful world of birds. There were parakeets, macaws, cockatoos, flamingos, pelicans – you name it. It must have been a living laboratory for an ornithologist, and the most delightful treat for our layman-eyes. I shot endless number of photographs – some of which are posted in my online photo album."
,,Really Good,5.0,,"We truly enjoyed this place. So many birds that we don't see in North America. Exhibits
mostly large and well designed. Is certainly worth a visit if one comes to S'Pore.
We took the unending Metro from Orchard Road (one hour) and then a 10 minute bus ride
to the park. A taxi might be worth the splurge. Only complaint would be that their
ice cream coolers can't handle the heat. We paid S$10 for two cones which were completely
melted out of the cooler. The attendant couldn't care less. The food concessions are also
mediocre at best. Eat before or after your visit."
,,overall good,4.0,,You can get close to few birds and fees them..Best time to step in to the park is at 12 as it takes onlh couple of hours to finish roaming in the park. Don't miss the high fly show at 3 PM and kings of skies at 4 PM as they are worth watching. You can buy combined ticket for bird park and night safari at 49dollars/A and get a bus service @ 5 dollars/A.
,,"Enjoy the birds, avoid the shows and the food",3.0,,"I am a huge birder and love to photograph birds, so I knew I'd love Jurong Bird Park. The park certainly offers plenty of opportunities to see interesting, rare and unusual birds. I particularly enjoyed the areas where birds were free-roaming and free-flying. Watching the gregarious parrots at the Lory Loft (and other visitors' responses to having the birds land on them) was also a lot of fun. Unfortunately (but not unusually) our visit was made more challenging by rainfall which was, at times, torrential. The misty, humid conditions also limited opportunities for photography. As other reviewers mentioned, this park is located quite some distance from the CBD. We took the MRT and public bus to the park, but the trip took well over an hour, so we returned in a taxi, which took only 20 minutes. Two pieces of advice, based on our own experience: 1) Unless you have children with you, skip the shows. The content and presentation style in the King of the Skies and Highflyers shows was thoroughly juvenile, and we were disappointed at the lost opportunity to present more educational information suitable for adults. After the rain started, we realised the time we had spent in these shows would have been much better spent exploring the park. 2) Make a plan to avoid buying any food at Jurong Bird Park. We paid exorbitant prices for an inedible meal at 'Bongo Burgers'. The (very limited) other options were pricey and looked woeful. Tragic to pay so much for a dreadful meal in a country where superb eating is so affordable. Pack some snacks or time meals around your visit."
,,Great place for family with kids,4.0,,"Weather: not hot or humid. Not a drop of rain although December is a rainy season.
Fee : $20 for Adult (added $5 for the tram as I was with a 5-year-old, I didnt want to tire him out) Otherwise, you can do without the tram cos the place isnt very big)
$13 for Child (but currently there is a promotion - you can show the coupon from their website and child gets FREE admission!)
Food: OMG ! It is not cheap and there doesnt seem to be a Halal certified outlet. Best to bring your own food/drinks. Plenty of places to sit down and eat your own food.
Great attractions that you musn't miss:
Lori Lofty (beautiful colourful parrots for you to feed at $3 per cup). And nice swinging bridges for you to try. We spent wonderful times in there. Delightful experience.
Show time : Don't miss the High Flyers Show and the Kings of the Skies - Eye-opening !
Penguin Coast : Two feeding areas - one just outside the Penguin Coast. Pay $2 and feed the penguin. They are so orderly and patient creatures. Adore them ! After this feed, the Penguin keeper will go inside the Penguin Coast and feed the penguins (these penguins are in a cold room)
Owls - also a not-to-be-missed.
Macaw/Flamingoes - colourful Macaws/Flamingoes await you.
First Aid : Available - just ask the staff and they will assist you even if it is just a small cut.
Getting There and Getting Out of there : If have $, go by cab if you do not stay anywhere near Jurong and to avoid the morning office crowd esp weekdays. I live in the East of Singapore, so travelling time by bus/mrt took me more than an hour especially peak hours because Bird Park closes at 6pm.
If kids love Water Play, bring swim suit - Birdz of Play. Check out their website.
I didnt try the Lunch with Parrots, nor was I anywhere near it so I am unable to comment.
Getting out of there : Take bus 194 and head for Jurong Point and enjoy a dinner before heading home. Go to CANTEEN, Basement of Jurong Point for exotic Halal cuisines at affordable price. Korean, Japanese, Ayam Penyet, Chicken Rice, Fish Soup, Ban Mian, Beef Noodles, Western Food, BBQ Food, Carrot cake, Oyster Omelette...many more. Definitely more varieties and cheaper than what sold at Jurong Bird Park."
,,Love it Everytime!,5.0,,"This is the second time I was on a Tour East trip to the Jurong Bird Park and I cannot wait to go again. I like the fact that the first time or two I went with a guide that knows what shows to go to when and what to see if you have only a little bit of time. The next time I go will be for much longer to enjoy more instead of to see as much as I can. You really need at least half a day here. Kids and adults alike will love all the birds, animals, etc. The shows are exceptionally well done; the staff obviously enjoy their jobs. I always liked the hints of environmentalism that were included. The prices were very reasonable. There is a tram that goes around the park if you do not want to do too much walking. The Lory Lodge was a hit with the birds coming right up to you and will perch themselves on your hands. One even wandered around my moms' head for a minute. Will be back for sure! Although Singapore is not big, this seemed far from the main attractions in the centre of town. Lots of shops with reasonable prices."
,,Great time at the bird park,5.0,,I have to say that some reviews below should be erased. This is a great park to visit. Many rare birds you don't see everyday or ever. This park helps save and protect different species of birds that would be extinct if it weren't for the park. Shows were great and entertaining. Recommend for all ages.
,,Fantastic time,5.0,,"It was wonderful to see that the birds were obviously very well taken care of. I caught a bird show while I was there, which was very interactive and very entertaining. The part of the park that I enjoyed the most was the parrot enclosure, where you could feed the birds with a liquid sugar concoction (I think), and the birds would pile up on top of you to eat it. I will definitely be visiting again."
,,Mixed Impressions,3.0,,"When a bird park, that is designed to be like a ""Sea World"" has Cassorwaries, Birds of Paradise, Rare Birds of Prey, Snowy Owls, Hornbills, Flamingos, Macaws, all of which, at one time or another that have been on the endangered species list, you have to ask yourself, education or exploitation? Jurong Bird Park boasts to be home of thousands of rare species of birds, some of which, like the hornbills, have been released to live in the park.

I had a good day at this pricy park, and of course I really had fun at the High Flyers Show, which I went to twice. Once to get a feeling for how to take pictures of flying birds and the second time to get in the right seats to volunteer so my husband could take a close up shot of me feeding the toucans. I did get some incredible photos at the show and throughout the park exhibits, even through the tightly woven fencing. The parrot behavior show was a rip-off because they wanted you to buy the full buffet lunch for each person, not just a drink and food item like the brochure says.

Bring an umbrella, as it rained hard in the late afternoon, but it was interesting to watch the parrots behavior as they enjoyed their rain ""shower."" I saw many new bird species, that I had never seen before, or even knew about their existence.

Just like Sea World, I question how well these animals are cared for and I also question how they were able to acquire so many endangered species?

We arrived early and left before rush hour. Our taxi ride from Katong was roughly $25.00 Singapore dollars each way."
,,Expected more,3.0,,"Having spent a week in Singpore my fiancee and I had been really looking forward to this jaunt. The trip from the Outram Rd MRT to Boon Lay and then a bus took about an hour...arriving just on opening at 830am. We meandered through some of the exhibits, the Shoebill being a particular highlight before the Kings of the Skies show at 10am. This was deliberately aimed it seemed at a very young audience, and I felt so much more could have been done on an education front about the birds of prey. Some good photo opportunities with the owls and eagles. Once the half hour show finished we headed to the next show starting at 11 that show-cased Macaws, Toucans, and Hornbills. This again was aimed at a very young age-group. Following this we attempted to find something to eat. There are extremely limited options...and it is overpriced and very average. Would definitely recommend bringing your own snacks and then returning to the Boon Lay mall for more tastier options once you have finished at the Bird Park. The highlight overall for me was probably the varying sub species of Hornbill. The waterfall is a must see and the Lorrikeet feeding is great if you don't mind having small birds land on you. For my mind the Singapore Zoo is a much better option if you only had the choice of doing one of these activities. Photo opportunities abound...but many of the birds of prey and Hornbills are in barred cages detracting from both viewing and photography aspects."
,,Best Bird Park,5.0,,"The park can be reached conveniently via the Bus service running from the Boon Lay MRT. Reaching the park, the first sight greeting me was that of waddling little penguins and I knew then and there that this attraction is going to be one of its kind. I hopped onto the tram ride and did a complete lap once just to get a hang of all the spots and circled down my favourites on the map.
The obvious winners are the flamingo and swan lakes for the sheer beauty of these birds. But i was also very glad to stop near the noisy parrots. Some very very beautiful members they have there. Don't forget the Lory Lift and get clicking with a bird perched on your shoulder!"
,,One of it's kind !!,4.0,,"We went to Jurong bird park late in the afternoon, dead tired after visit from Singapore Zoo. Still, sight of colorful and chirping birds filled us with energy. It wasn't much crowded at 4 PM on a weekday. We caught their 4.30 show which featured vultures and owls. This is the best thing about Singapore Parks (Zoo, Safari or bird park) that they pepper it with interactive shows & those memories get etched in your mind forever. I had never seen so colorful birds - purple parrots, scarlet sparrows, pink flamingos. It was really a wonderful sight. They also run a tram if you are not much interested in exploring on your feet.

There is also a small water play area if you intend to get wet. It could be good fun for small kids. So please bring one pair of clothes for the small ones.

Our only wish was to have more time as we could not explore it in full. Please don't club Singapore zoo & Bird Park in one day, you won't be able to give justice to the park you visit second. It's good idea to club Bird Park & Night Safari as you will have some energy left for Night Safari.

Taxi fare from Singapore Zoo to Bird Park was ~ $11 in off peak weekday (around 3.30 PM). Buying an unlimited Iventurecard is a good idea if you intend to visit all the 4 parks + some more attractions."
,,Awesome Birds Show,5.0,,I did not even think that I will be excited or feel awesome when I start to the Bird's Park(B'coz after a full night journey with out sleep). When I got down @ the park's entrance my feelings started to change after seeing 100's + banana in one stem. Then immediately after entering I found Penguins aviary(def a surprise for me to see it in a tropical country like SIG) . Then took the tram and went all around the park in it to see 400 species. At the of the ride we rushed to the Birds show which is a must see attraction if you are in this park.
,,Singapore Jurong Bird Park - the Asia's largest bird paradise.,5.0,,This is a beautiful park with 5000 birds across 400 species. There are 4 large free-flight aviaries where visitors come really close to the birds. Several bird shows / feeding sessions are presented each day. The tram ride is a quick way to explore the park with less walking to do. It is a great place for all birds and nature lovers.
,,Wonderful experience !,5.0,,This place is a must visit in Singapore ! Amazing variety of birds spread across a large area.Specially loved the Lory Loft part with a chance to feed birds and once you have the food in hand - they will just flock all over you. Tram experience is a little dull as you don't get to see the birds at a closer range - but you can always walk ! and use the tram for returning to the main station. Tickets are also available without tram option as well. The 2 shows - High Flyers and King of the skies were great with the birds show casing their skills.There is also a children's play area for the kids to have fun. Lot of enclosures with different birds provide an up-close view of these beautiful creatures.Overall a great place !
,,A great bird park,4.0,,"One of the best bird sanctuaries I've ever seen. Its all paved,and signposted so you won't get lost,theres a map supplied. Also there is a trolley cart to go around,hop on and off as you like at the bus stops of course. There are birds from all over the world,mainly tropical,well worth the visit."
,,A must see..,5.0,,"We booked the 3 in 1 park hopper ticket (includes Jurong Bird Park, Singapore Zoo and Night Safari) through Expedia. Jurong was our first destination among them and we reached there at 8.30 a.m. That was a good decision we have taken as upto 10 a.m. there were very few people.
Also after 10, the horiible weather made it difficult to walk.

We started with the Penguins, then moved to pelicans and other birds, covered half of the Park and then started to follow the timelines of the shows and keeper talks. The shows were really amazing and spectacular.
The nursery was also a great place to visit.

The Lori feed was also good. Though I have expected chance to feed other kind of birds.

Unlike Zoo and Night safari, The tram ride is not very effective in the bird park. Use the tram only when you are tired.

Overall, I rate this attraction as must see in Singapore.

When going out at nearly 12.30 p.m. we had problems to get taxi. We were standing in short queue, but number of taxis were very less. Ultimately we got a black one (probably something like premier) in which others ahead in the queue were not interested. So, please keep sufficient time in hand if you have a plan after getting out from the Bird park.

Most importantly, drink penty of water if you are going to walk the whole area."
,,Best Bird Park in the Whole World,5.0,,"This got to be the best bird park in the whole world . The aviary, the bird shows are amazing.They have some rare collection of birds .Singapore has many attractions and if you are pressed for time and is the option is to choose between Night Safari and the Bird Park,just choose this."
,,Great bird park.,4.0,,"This is a great park to visit. It is easily five times better than the one in KL. There is a bus that takes you there from some of the main hotels or you can catch a train then a local bus right to the park. Allow at least half a day.

In the park is a tram which is worth the extra cost due to the inclines you will need to walk otherwise. Especially with small children."
,,A Favorite of Ours!!!,5.0,,We visit every time we go to Singapore! It is a must see for anyone who enjoys birds. The varity is amazing! So much to see that every visit is like the 1st time - always something new to see.
,,An amazing place,4.0,,"We visited Jurong Bird Park recently on a visit to Singapore before embarking on a cruise. Our hotel in Orchard Road was a bus pick up point direct to the park so it was very convenient for us and we also saw plenty of sights from the bus as well which was a bonus as our time was limited.

The park itself is a beautiful place and well maintained with lots of orchids, trees and plants. We spent four hours there in the morning and took in the penguin feeding, the 11am show which was very entertaining, and walked through the free flight aviary. You are able to get really close to the birds, and we particularly loved the Caribbean flamingos. It is an easy park in which to walk, but it does get very hot so take water and wear a hat. If the heat and humidity gets too much you can always take refuge in the airconditioned eating areas, as we did.

If you are visiting Singapore, this place is a must to visit, especially if you are a bird lover."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"This place was so Amazing. we spent an afternoon here (12 - 4). The birds in some of the aviaries are very beautiful.

Don't miss the wings Bird show. they have actually trained the birds to perform. pretty amazing.

Kids would love this place. especially the parrot feeding, where the birds can be fed. they would actually sit on ur hands. careful though.. they bite.. :) visit the waterfalls as well, the view is quite spectacular.

Better to walk around the place. unless you don't want to walk in the warm and humid Singapore weather.

Easy to reach the place, get off at Boon Lay (green line MRT) and take bus No. 194. stops outside the park.

WORTH IT!!"
,,Jurong bird park,2.0,,"Recently visited Jurong Bird Park, travelled by Taxi from East coast cost 20 which is very reasonable. Bird park is old and needs a makeover, plants in some areas over grown unable to see birds if they were there. Lorries feeding and nursery was the highlight but the rest was very average. Food at Congo was excellent."
,,jurong bird park,3.0,,"We are from johor bahru, take bus from kota raya 2 to jurong east singapore only Rm2.20. Use 160 or 170 sbs transit to reach singapore kastam. Then only can take 160 to jurong east bus station. Then, take mrt to boon lay. Take bus 194 to jurong bird park. Remember prepare the small notes to pay for bus fee. Not ticketing counter for it. Quite tired to walk like zoo as well. Some shows for it and the water playground for free... besides that, they have 2 girls and 2 boys inside water playground for security. Very clean and safe facilities here."
,,Jurong - Really good,4.0,,"Very wide selection of birds and the whole place is very well organised.

Lorry (not sure about spelling) feeding was fun.

The show at amphitheatre was very well orchestrated. Amazingly well trained birds.

The tram ride can be avoided. Walk around for a couple of hours, and your job is done."
,,Cool and Beautiful,4.0,,Kids and we adults too had a great time. This is maintained well. The colourful orchids in the entrance itself is very pleasing. If you dont want to get tired take tickets with tram. Have sun glasses and drinking water. Have changing dress for kids handy as there is a small water ride. Lots of colourful and great birds arranged by the species. Penguins also are there. Be sure to attend all the shows and feeding time of yr favourite ones. The Lory feeding was a great experience and all of us enjoyed it. One of those birds liked pecking mens' heads. That was a funny scene. The artificial waterfall and the other birds too were good. This is a must watch if you have kids younger than 12 yrs.
,,A day well spent.,4.0,,"The park is lovely and good value for money. I spent about 4 and a half hours wandering around the park at my leisure. I didn't go to all the shows as I found that there were more interesting things to see just walking slowly around the park.
The only complaint is that there were some birds, in particular the ostriches, that were missing a lot of feathers and, as I believe this to be due to stress, I would like to see the park address this issue. Maybe bigger enclosures would help.
The food at the cafes could also be healthier."
,,Great day of family fun,5.0,,"I tackled Jurong Bird Park alone with four kids aged 1 to 10 and was pleasantly surprised at how manageable the whole experience was. The park was well laid out (a little hilly, but I hired a wagon for the younger ones, and it was good exercise for me), and just big enough for the kids to be interested but not get too bored. After viewing (and feeding) the birds, we went to the water play area which was not crowded at all (it was a weekday) and great fun. I would highly recommend this place for families but suggest you take a change of clothes for yourself and swimmers and towels for the kids for the water play area."
,,Great Exhibit of Birds,5.0,,Last visited this park in 1994 and enjoyed just as much this time. We caught a taxi which cost under S$20. You can get there by train but having two small children we opted for the taxi each way. Because we had flown with Singapore Airlines and took advantage of their SIA stopover deal we received free passes for each of us to fifteen attractions including the bird park. We hired one of the kiddies wagons for the kids to ride in. The bird show High Flyers was great. If you want to try and be part of the show sit in the middle section about half way up and don't worry about offering up S$2 as you get it back. There is also a kids water park which is great to cool off in the afternoon and a Ben & Jerry ice cream parlour but is a little expensive. A beautiful display of birds.
,,Jurong Bird Park - Wow,5.0,,I visited the Jurong Bird Park as well as the other WRS parks and this was probably the best park of all four. My favourite parts were the Lory Feeding where you can feed beautiful Australasian Lories as well as Penguin Coast (with over 200 penguins) and the African waterfall Aviary (the world's largest walk-in aviary). Absolutely incredible.
,,The Flying Kingdom,4.0,,"Amazing place to see variety of bird from all across the world in 1 place! The place itself is not really but it designed beautifully so you can enjoy the view and birds wherever you look at. Great Place to have fun with family and friends in singapore. It's a perfect place for those who just love to stand still or walking around and enjoy watching the birds flying around you.
Last but not least, Totally worth it to be visited when you have some free time in singapore! some tips, make sure to have a plenty time to visit this kind of place, because the main point is enjoying and relaxing. have fun! :D"
,,Colorful birds,4.0,,My family enjoyed looking at colorful birds and enjoyed the experience of looking at some of the birds for the first time. One should definetly make a visit to Jurong bird park.
,,kids love it,5.0,,"This was our second visit to the park in 4 years. Its an excellent place for kids. The staff is committed and friendly The place is well maintained. We took the tram ride around the park which serves as quick intro to the park. My kids were all excited to feed the Loris on the loft. Very good collection of different bird species...macaus, hornbills, flamingoes, eagles, emus, dolphins, owls in particular..there is this ""discover"" route with loads of things for the kids ( an us for sure) to learn from...the shows are great and then they have hathcery were you get a peek into the breeding and preservation work that is being carried out at the park...very informative and very exciting trip for all...we will keep coming back ( our kids will ensure that :) ).."
,,awesome experience,4.0,,"It takes almost 1 and half hours to reach this place from the city. So plan your things accordingly.
Nearest attraction is the Science center which takes around 7 sing dollars by cab.
The park is well maintained.
Don't miss the Bird show, the penguin feeding session, the parrots feeding session where the parrots may actually come and sit on your hand or sholders and have their food.
Will take around 3 hours to complete the whole thing
If you are with small children hire a strolley at around 9 to 15 sing dollars as its very hectic to carry them.
Finally wear light clothes and take your sun glasses along as it can be very hot and humid.
Food is allowed inside."
,,Nice,4.0,,"If you love birds and nature, this is the place to be.
This is a small park which can be covered in half a day; however, if you browse longer and take your time, a day will be more appropriate.
I like the bird show where they highlight different bird species; some even flying on top of your head. I think this is the main attraction.
You can take the free trolley around the park but if you would like to see plants, walking is a good alternative.The entrance is full of orchids of different varieties. Really nice.
Will recommend to families."
,,Places for family and kids,5.0,,Visited this place with my friend and her daughter. Had fun with her. We packed some lunch and did a picnic kind of thing surrounding with many birds. Kids will surely have fun.
,,Best in the World,5.0,,"This is a magnificent bird park, i guess this is the best bird park ever created to all the bird lovers and animal lovers. This is a day park, expect to spend at least 4 hours to explore all the exhibits in here. The attractions include:

Bring along water for a long walk in here, buying water from the stores or vending machines is expensive! Bring your sun hat, sunblock lotion along, and insect repellent as well."
,,Jurong Bird Park - what a surprise!,5.0,,"I am not a bird person, however, my wife wanted to go, so I did. I was most impressed with Jurong Bird park and would revisit Jurong again. As with the day Zoo, plan your walking around the feeding times and shows.

So many different species, colours and unusual shapes and sizes.

We bought a four park combined ticket which was certainly worth it. The other parks/properties included - the Singapore Zoo night safaris, day zoo and river safaris."
,,A fabulous day out,4.0,,"There were beautiful macaws, colourful flamingos, toucans, cockatoos, lorikeets and amazing garden enclosure bird displays. The park contains so many different and unique birds you cant help but feel relaxed and amazed by their gracefulness and tranquility. The bird show was worth watching.
The lorikeet feeding allows guests to get so close to these feathered creatures as they snack on the your nectar and get great photos.
The park bus/tram trip was too fast and jerky. Would give that a miss."
,,Jurong bird park,5.0,,We have travelled to Singapore several times but had not gone to the bird park. It was fantastic. We arrived at 10am and left at 5pm on closing time. They have something for everyone and all ages. The Pelican show and the Birds of Prey show are so entertaining.Adults and children sitting mesmerised oohing and ahhing at the appropriate times. It is a thoroughly fun day for the whole family.
,,JURONG BIRD PARK SINGAPORE.,5.0,,"One of the excellent places i have visited in entire of my life.Well kept birds,hygienically maintaine environment & healthy birds."
,,Spectacular shows,4.0,,"The bird was one of the finest I have visited. Before setting out, enquire about the timings of the shows. These shows are the highlights and should not be missed, especially the ""high fliers ""and birds of prey. We also got to see the feeding time when many birds came down to feed. The staff and trainers there were very friendly. Good for a family outing especially with children"
,,Awesome Experience,5.0,,The place is full of beautiful and colorful species of all kinds of birds. There are various shows...I watched the Hawk show. Very informative and interactive.
,,Colorful and spectacular!,5.0,,"I went to the jurong bird park just to see those little colorful lorry lofts in action...what a bird, incredible color combinations. Wish I was there throughout. these are from parrot family and spectacular. Glad they are living in a very nice environment.

The show high flyer is my favorite, unbelievable that birds can listen to humans :)

A must visit if you are in Singapore!"
,,Great place for the bird show,5.0,,"Great shows by the birds and the trainers. Nice place for children visit. A variety of birds. You must take a full day for visiting the place. The birds are in large areas at different levels and require time and energy. You can get tired at the end of the day. If its one of those sunny days, carry a hat for the sun or umbrella."
,,Ok. But could be much better,3.0,,"I really enjoyed the zoo & had high expectations for the bird park. Perhaps I was tired & hot but I thought the bird park was just ok, not great not bad, just ok.
There was large great enclosures but the number of birds able to be seen was low. I thought the KL bird park was better? It also was quite hilly & there was quite a distance to be covered between exhibits which was tedious (I'm in my early 30's & quite fit so I wonder how older / less fit people would find getting around?).
In the defence of the bird park they had lots areas closed for maintenance so perhaps it is usually or will be better in the future.
Of you like birds and animals I suggest worth a visit but be prepared for the walking & hills!"
,,Wide Variety of Birds,4.0,,"This is definitely a place to visit on a nice day, as it it an outdoor venue. If you like birds, you should go to see some of the unusual varieties in this park, especially some of the local species not seen elsewhere. I'd recommend going early so you can see the shows, which we unfortunately missed because we arrived late. We arrived late as it is far from the center of Singapore, but it is accessible by the subway, exit Boon Lay and take the 251 or 194 bus, which require exact change. Budget onehour travel time from central Singapore."
,,Live Experiences in World of Colourful Birds,5.0,,"I will recommend to follow the suggested itinerary on http://www.birdpark.com.sg for the morning 8:30am to 1:30pm time or afternoon 1:30pm to 6pm time.

There are many Exhibits in the park. Amazing and unforgettable experience to see the birds and their feeding habits in all exhibits (Birds of prey, Breeding and Research Centre, Dinosaur Decendants, Flamingo Lake, Flamingo Pool, Heliconia Walk, Hornbill & Toucans Exhibit, Jungle Jewel Flight Aviary, Lory Loft, Mandarian Duck, Macaw Island, Parrot Paradise, Pelican Cove, Penguin Coast, The Riverine, Royal Ramble, Scarlet Ibis, Shore Birds, The Southeast Asian Birds Aviary, Spoonbills, Swan Lake, Waterfall Aviary, Wetlands, Window on Paradise, World of Darkness).

Do not forget to see High Flyers Show & Kings of the Skies Show, the live shows unique in nature with trained birds and their trainers. Reach the show venue at least 15 minutes earlier to have a front seat. Be ready to be a volunteer in the show when asked. Mesmerizing experience. At the end of the show, you can have photos with them. Be fast for this.

If you are with kids or not, do not bother, experience of Lory Feeding at Loft Lory (8:30am to 6pm) is a signature event, not to be missed. Arm yourself with a cup of nectar and within a second or two, you’ll be the popular attraction to some of the friendliest birds you have ever met. Yes, in all colours of the rainbow! Chat with our gregarious birds as they perch on your hands and shoulders while helping themselves to the delicious nectar you are holding. Try to see other birds feeding sessions also.

At Birds of Play, get ready for big splashes of fun at this bird themed water playground! Gear up for a massive soaking experience under the giant tipping bucket, zip across the Flying Fox, step into the Gamez room for endless hours of arcade action and more!"
,,Great for kids,4.0,,"I dragged my husband along to this park as I wanted to take along our 14 month old son who loves birds. The park is well laid out and we spent at least half a day there. There are shows for kids and there's a great water play/park area which our son loved so make sure you bring bathers for children (and whichever parent is going to accompany your child if you have a young toddler. Pack the sunscreen and hats as while there are shaded areas, you're also in the sun quite a bit. Oh and bring the mosquito spray and bite cream. There are quite a few mozzies. My hubby said it was better than he expected."
,,A very good photo spot,4.0,,This is one of the best place in Singapore for photos. I suggest to go to this place on a good weather otherwise you will be disappointed.
,,Take the kids ..they would love it,5.0,,The bird show will really make your kids happy... Many places to see out there. Waterfall is another attraction. Take the train inside park to get a faster view of the attractions
,,Good Place......Must Go if you love birds,4.0,,The best part was the two shows.... King of the Skies and High Fliers show...... dont miss it... reach early morning around 9.......... plus there is bird feeding...... and you get to see many varieties of birds..... A good place to visit if you are a bird lover......
,,Amazing!,4.0,,"I love the Birds of Prey and the King of the Skies shows. I have never seen a flock of well-trained birds parade before my very eyes! The performance was superb! Kudos to the trainers and the staff. But I wonder if the train is working. I had to walk to cover everything and see all the birds.

I came with complimentary tickets from our company and the staff who attended to me at the ticketing counter was quite hesitant on how to go about it. After 10 - 15 minutes of waiting, they finally got me my ticket.

I enjoyed my stay overall. Will visit again with my family."
,,Awesome place to visit birds of many variety,4.0,,Jurong bird park is a must see for tourist visiting Singapore.The bird shows and tram ride is a must to do.Also do feed the lories in their loft and also at the bird feeding station and enjoy seeing the birds eat from your hand.There is also a children outdoor water play area so do take a extra pair of swim suits in case you wish to get wet.
,,Lovely except for the penguins,4.0,,"Enjoyed visiting the bird park after first visiting 26 years ago. I was not happy seeing the penguin/seagull enclosure as the birds looked miserable in their artificial environment. They must just sit there every day bored out of their brains!
It was uncomfortable looking at them. I hope they do something about them.
To make the most of the park you need to be there at the right times for feeding etc or you really don't get your moneys worth."
,,Interesting day out for the whole family,4.0,,"Our family of 4, including a 1 year old and a 5 year old recently visited the bird park for the first time, on a holiday to Singapore. We found the displays really interesting and I loved seeing so many colorful and exotic birds. The flamingos and scarlet ibis were stunning. The bird show at the pools amphitheater was fantastic. Our 1 year old was mesmerized and so excited by all the colorful birds.

We bought a tram ticket but the park is small enough to walk around so unless you are not so mobile I wouldn't bother buying a ticket. The trams also ran infrequently. At one stage we waited over 15 mins for a tram and we could have walked to the next stop in that time frame.

The birds of play water park was a huge hit with our kids. Take swimmers for them and mum or dad too if they are little kids as they need to be supervised and you will get drenched!

All up we spent 4.5 hours there, including a stop for lunch and the water play area."
,,First rate,5.0,,"As you'd expect, the bird park follows the excellent example set by it's larger sibling the Singapore Zoo.

The park is clean, staff are helpful, plentiful and friendly, the landscaping of the various enclosures is superb, there's basically nothing to complain about.

There are food and drink options everywhere, a great play area for kids. It's a great way to spend a couple of hours with kids of any ages."
,,So many birds to see in one park! Some we had not even heard of!,4.0,,"It was enlightening and educational. Many years ago, I invested in a pair of binoculars to pursue my interest in bird watching. Here my dream came true, without the use of binoculars. It was an amazing experience. Birds of all five continents.

Colourful, unique, flying and flightless ones, names so precisely descriptive of their appearances. Some differentiating from the other in a very subtle way. Show cases in different areas had educational material in general and emphasised on forest conservation to preserve natural habitat of endangered species. Shows were the attractions of the bird park.

It is a good idea to know when the shows and bird feeding times are on. Plan to spend four hours to enjoy the birds and the shows. Not less than 2 to 3 hours.

Some areas were closed for renovation. The park seemed to be out of the way. For 3 persons the cab ride was the easiest way to get there and back."
,,Dated and in need of maintenance but great show,3.0,,"After visiting both the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, we found the Jurong Bird Park a disappointment.

The Bird Park is not as accessible as the Zoo or Night Safari by public transport. We took the MRT to Boon Lay Station on the East West Line and then a 194 bus from the interchange. The website will give you 2 options to take a bus. Don't bother with the 251 which is a much longer route back to the MRT station. The bus options from the MRT are also not as well signed as the Singapore Zoo or Night Safari. Just take the 194 which is a relatively straight forward and frequent loop service from Boon Lay Interchange. The MRT is approximately 45 minutes from the Singapore City Centre.

The Bird Park is not as busy as the Zoo or Night Safari for good reason. This may in part be due to its distance from the Singapore City Centre. The Bird Park feels dated compared to the other parks. Many of the attractions are in poor repair and in need of maintenance. The Monorail track and trains can still be seen throughout the park but this was shut down some years back and replaced with a tram similar to the Zoo and Night Safari, which is a shame.

Access to parts of the waterfall aviary were not accessible and the lift to the upper levels was not in service. Further parts of the Lorikeet Enclosure were closed.

While the park feels dated and in need of a serious refresh, the birds are brilliant and stunning. We enjoyed the experience if feeding the Lorikeets and Eclectus Parrots in the Lorikeet Enclosure with birds landing on your hands and back for a feed of the nectar (approximately SD$2). However I felt there was a lack of any detailed education on the birds and behaviours with all information very limited and basic.

There are a few food options including a couple of cafes and eateries which were pretty basic.

The highlight of our visit would be the High Flyers Show. In comparison with the Zoo and Night Safari shows, this was absolutely stunning and by far the best feature of the park. We enjoyed every moment for the show and it was this bird show that made our visit worthwhile. You'll be amazed at the intelligence and elegance of the bird world with macaws, toucans and parrots amazing you.

If you have run out of things to do in Singapore, the Jurong Bird Park is worth a visit. However if you're only here for a short visit, I'd give this a miss with both the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari far superior.

I hope that they upgrade the facilities and improve the maintenance of the park. The idea of a dedicated bird park is great, however it needs money and work to improve the experience."
,,BRILLIANT - 1 less thing on the bucket list,5.0,,"For the past 25 years I'd dreamed of visitng the flamingos at the brid park in Singapore; this year this dream came true, and as such it was part pilgramage.
Ticket bought on-line and combining the Night Safari made entry seamless; likewise the bus that collected us across from our motel on Mandarin Road, transferred us in the evening and dropped us home at night.
The bird-park was just a delight. The performances from the flamingos, hornbills, macaws, to the birds of prey were just amazing. Lunch with ""Picasso"" overlooking the flamingos whilst eating laksa and icecream. The included train ride gave a great overview of all that there was to see,
Wandering through jungle and waterfall enclosures, observing the weirdest of palms that so looked like flamingos. Singing the American national anthem to the bald eagle, much to the embarassment of my family and the astonishment of the eagle - at least he looked my way for a photo. Being attacked by the red cockatoo as I attempted to take a cage-wire free photo and being blown away by the colours of the red ibis and spoon-bills, not to mention being pecked by the crested pigeons, the horn bils that flew into the trees and the amazing shoe-bill bird (scarey).
Educationally, there were amazibg dislays of eggs and also the ""hatchery"" where infant birds were on display - so enteratining to watch them test and try there new abilities (just like watching your own child learnign to walk).
The highlight of-course, was the flamingos - those strange unbelieveable birds of fantasy colours, impossible legs and of dreams"
,,Beautiful Park for bird lovers,4.0,,It was an amazing experience ti see so many beautiful birds all in one park.There was a huge variety of parrots and the parrot show was awesome.Must watch
,,Childrens' water park and shows a must!,4.0,,"My husband and I visited here with our 16 month old daughter on a Saturday morning. We were all impressed with both of the shows and agreed that they make the trip worthwhile. Even our daughter was engaged and excited by the birds flying overhead. The water park is also a great addition and they provided ample changing space for our daughter. It's a great way to break up the day and allow a cool down in the Singapore heat. The only negative would be that it seems the parking is quite limited. By the time we were leaving there was a long queue to enter the lot. I would recommend arriving early to avoid this inconvenience. Overall, a surprisingly fun family outing!"
,,A paradise for bird enthusiasts,4.0,,"Felt like I'm at the sets of the Jurassic park. The citizens of the sky are made to feel at home and they are all around you. You could feed them, take photos with them, overall a place where man and birds mingle in harmony. They also have special shows which were quite fascinating. There are trams to take you around the park but they are not required unless you are two lazy to walk a kilometer."
,,birds are friendly,5.0,,A lifetime experience of seeing birds so close and see their habitat they loves to come to you for food and you must admire their beauty. There are 1000 of birds around you and you will love to see their beauty.Some of the birds like crane came to us for foods we loved it and my son also loves it.
,,For excellent Information and Enjoyment,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is an ideal place to be if you want to spend some quality time along with the avian species amidst natural surroundings. The sheer variety of birds, excellent upkeep and the fantastic shows sets this bird park in a different league of its own among its various competitors in different part of the world. You can easily spent the whole day in the bird park and never get bored since there are various shows at different parts of the day. Please take the hop on hop off tram if you are not keen to walk you way in the entire park. If you are put up in the city center, it's advisable to take a cab directly to the park since there are no MRT stations close to the park and bus services from the nearest MRT stations are not dependable as they are very erratic."
,,Wonderful outing for all ages,5.0,,"Not as I remembered it 35 years ago, but still really enjoyed it. Huge park with lots to see - make sure you visit all the enclosed areas and have your camera ready for plenty of colourful photos. Take the tour and get off the train whenever you can - plenty to see. Even if you dont do that, there are plenty of colourful birds to see just inside the entrance - flamingos, parrots, macaws and many more. Park was clean and well-marked. Several shows to see, One had lots of pelicans and flamingos and really unusual birds to be in a bird show. Also a Hawk show, with birds of prey and owls - very interesting and informative too ! The kids will love that one - just near that show was a wonderful water experience for the kids - make sure you have their bathers with you - they will really love you if you do. All in all, a wonderful days outing."
,,Not enough time to see it all,5.0,,"We were only in Singapore for a short time, but we made it out to here. We took a taxi to it as we were trying to maximize our time at each place for the day. This park was really big and had a lot of interesting birds. I enjoyed taking pictures in the aviaries with my long lens. The park was really nice, and we took a bus straight to the River Safari on the other side of town to save time. They don't run very often so make sure you get there on time!"
,,Lovely setting,4.0,,"The bird park is about an hour train ride from City Hall SMRT, then a 10 minute bus ride. Take the green SMRT line to Boon Lay EW27 and then from there go to the bus station (next to Boon Lay SMRT). Catch bus number 194. It is all vey easy. To return, catch the bus from the same place as you where dropped off. This takes you back to train station. There is also a good shopping mall next to the station so have a look around when you return. I enjoyed the bird park but I think it sounds like it is better if you go when the bird shows are on."
,,Fun afternoon in Jurong Bird Park!,5.0,,"Didn't expect that there are so many different species of birds here but I was pleasantly surprised, parrots, flamingos, pelicans, swans, penguins, eagles, toucans, owls. Had a fun and educational afternoon watching the birds. We watched a bird show there too, the owls were smart and cute. We also played with the friendly and colourful rainbow lorikeet. We were lucky enough to catch the flamingos doing their ritual dance while we were there. It was funny and adorable.The bird park is well maintained so it is a pleasure to walk around and explore it. Don't miss this if you love animals and birds!"
,,Various species of Colorful Birds,4.0,,"This was not on my list of places to visit while in Singapore, however, as i purchased park hopper special tickets (3-in-1 tickets for Zoo, Night Safari and Bird Park), i visited this place without much expectations. However, i ws bowled over by the different kinds of species that this park has and that too in nicely arranged exhibits. The park is not very big and one can manage the walking. Take the tram only to decide on what exhibits to go to. You will be surprisd to see birds in so many virant colors (all natural).Plan your trip so as to cover atleast one show in the park. There are some exhibits wherein you can actually feed the birds. There is a small play area for kids as well. This closed at 5:30 so please pln accordingly. Another highlight of the park was the penguins arena. This was the first time i saw penguins with naked eye and was truely amazed. If you have children, then this place must be on your list. Can spend half a day in this park."
,,nice experience,5.0,,"i was surprised to see a bird park like this.. nicely managed, maintained.. dont miss their shows.. all r nice.. well trained.. must watch high flyers show.. go early to get seats.. at least 20 mins early to all the shows.. you can take food n drinks along with u or you can buy there as well. go early so that u wont miss any shows and you can leave early. There is bus which connects to MRT and MRT connects to all over singapore"
,,Ridiculous collection of birds,5.0,,"One of the best collection of birds in the world. very well maintained and a wonderful way to spend the whole day. plus, you get to feed the birds !"
,,Do go,4.0,,"Been in Singapore for years so the vegetation is much more mature than some other attractions. Well tended grounds and beautiful flowering plants.

Great range of birds. Must go to one of the shows as better than seeing the birds in static cages, we saw the Birds of Prey and was well worth it. The tram is a quick way to get the layout and for tired bored kids. But better to walk and see all the exhibits which have good information along side them and there are much more than can be seen from the tram.

Only Western food on site so dont bother eating there, not great and pricy.

Buy the multi-pass if you intend going to zoo/night safari. Good early when cooler and to avoid crowds."
,,Amazing experience here,5.0,,This is a very beautiful place to go You need atleast half day to completly see it. The bird shows happens here which is amazing.
,,nature was unveiled revealed and discovered,5.0,,"bird park visit need to spend whole day so dont go with tourist guide or arrange tour but just take taxy or public transport to go to bird park.ticket hosue is just at enterance and after getting tickets ,enter in the bird park. donot take tour of park train that is useless and wastage of money untill and unless you are very old or disabled other wise just manage to attend bird show on left side of enterance at 10 am and then visit whole park on foot. it was an amazing experience to see face to face all types of bird throut the world at one place. to feed them directly was an pleasant and sensational observation. water falls, different segments of park were out of expectations.bird show timing should be confirmed before comming. show was remarkable and entertaining."
,,It's not worth it,3.0,,"I was really looking forward to visiting this park but was so let down :( definitely for bird lovers because if you're not a bird lover it's just out and out boring *yawn* We really tried to enjoy it but just couldn't. The only highlight was the birds of play area, what a fantastic water area for area for kids. The rest was over crowded over priced and abit naff"
,,Must see,5.0,,Totally exhilarating experience. ..make sure u dont miss the bird shows...weekdays less rush and unlimited tram rides....photos with the Macau birds are a good buy to keep a token of the wonderful memories!
,,For Young at Heart,5.0,,"This a great attraction for children. Plenty of up close up wildlife ,beautifully presented. And a lot of walk in and around. Many ,many varieties of birds , not just Asian or jungle based. The water park is excellent for kids, of all ages. Save it until after you have had a look around. The flamingos are a good feature. Not sure why the monorail is no longer in use. Make sure you catch at least one of the shows they put on,this is a good chance to sit children down and make sure they eat something. .And spend $3 on bird food for hand feeding, that’s an experience. The restaurant outside the park is good value, we found ice cream rather expensive inside the park itself.
Good access for wheelchairs and disabled. Not expensive for a family. Take plenty of shade with you as it can be hot with no sea breezes. Don’t bother trying to take water with you in Singapore, it just heats up. Buy it everywhere."
,,"It is a bird park....so never going to be overjoyed, but for a bird park pretty good.",4.0,,"Pretty clean and tidy but should be at the price. Well placed aircon facilities via shops or indoor displays. Each aviary well labelled in terms of where it came from, what it eats etc.

Most of the birds in great condition, that is apart from puffins and penguins and the odd Lowry bird.

Most of birds from Asia. The African enclosure is pretty impressive but sparse of birds"
,,"If you like birds (and possibly even if you don't), you will love this bird park",4.0,,"As with most attractions in Singapore, Jurong Bird Park is kept extremely clean, is well laid out and filled with thoughtful details which makes the entire experience a memorable one.

It is very big, and as such, even with big crowds you will never feel like the place is over crowded, excepting for places such as the lory loft of course. There are enough free roaming birds to keep you occupied but it is the bird shows which really add that extra bit of wow factor. Definitely try to catch all the shows that you can as they are worth it. The map will have the times and so try to keep a track of your bearings so that you can go to the shows at least 10 minutes early. Remember the place is huge and it can easily take 20 minutes from where you are to the show.

Overall, another place you have to visit if you are in singapore. If you have been to the bird park in KL, you know what to expect but this is on a bigger scale. Worth going to both."
,,Far ahead of any bird parks across the world,5.0,,There is no park like this one anywhere else in the world. Outstanding displays of birds from all over. Things not to miss would include: All The Shows - Specially one in the Amphitheatre Hatcheries - Showing new borns and the life/growth
,,So many species...,5.0,,There was a variety of birds. It was a beautiful sight seeing them! I would surely recommend this bird park as it is something not to be missed in singapore!!
,,"Great, but isolated",4.0,,"This is an excellent attraction for animal lovers. The park has species large and small from all over the world displayed in a variety of ways.

The main park is entirely open, with macaws and hornbills (among others) free flying around the park, though each has their own designated area for feeding. Most areas of the park are also open, but divided into sections, for example, the flamingos, swans and pelicans each have their own lakes which are cleverly divided using earth banks and fountains rather than fencing.

Some birds are caged for obvious reasons. The park has a range of birds of prey, including several species of eagle and vulture. They also have aviaries containing hornbills, parrots and cockatiels aswell as other smaller birds. There are two main aviary attractions; Lory Loft and The African Waterfall. At Lory Loft you can buy small pots of nectar (if memory serves, these were around £1.50 each) which, depending how many birds come to feed, could last about half an hour. There are park-employed photographers in this area who will take a no-obligation photo to view on the way out. The African Waterfall is a stunningly well-designed aviary, featuring the world's highest man-made waterfall as it's centrepiece. The exhibit contains approximately 1000 free-flying birds according to the guide, though many are very hard to spot. You can also buy feed in this area, though this is for scattering rather than direct feeding like in the Lory Loft

The park also runs two bird shows. The falconry show (Kings of the Skies) was actually quite disappointing for me. I have seen bird of prey shows in locations much less spectacular than this one but which were much more interesting. Worth a watch if you are new to falconry, but those who have seen shows before may be underwhelmed. The other show (High Flyers) was far better in my opinion. The show featured birds from all over the world performing natural 'tricks' and flying manoeuvres, with a bit of audience participation thrown in. It also boasts the record for the largest number of birds on one stage at a time with it's spectacular finish

All in all, the bird park is definitely worth a visit. Just be aware that the park is fairly isolated from transport. The closest MRT station is over 20 minutes walk away, with the shuttle bus not running very frequently. As long as you carefully plan your journey (which thanks to the Singapore transport system, is very easy to do) then you should have a very enjoyable day"
,,What a bird lover sanctuary!,5.0,,"I was NOT disappointed at Jurong Bird Park, it was wonderful to see so many species of free flighted birds in one place. Entry is S$20 per adult or you can save money and purchase a 2 Park Admission for S$39.

For only S$3 you can purchase some bird food and get up close and personal with some the world's most beautiful birds. Some were really cheeky, preferring to play then to eat. Definitely don't pass the bird aviary section of the bird park.

The rest of the park was wonderful but hard to walk around in Singapore's heat and humidity. Best to ride the park's train to main stations and walk around to specific areas of interest. The bird shows were pretty cool, showcasing many different birds in a story and even seeing a horse!

To get to Jurong bird park it is approximately an one hour journey via MRT to Boon Lay station and then bus ride 194 or 251 from Boon Lay Interchange (the bus stop you want is Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim). To leave from Jurong bird park, cross the road, walk under what looks like a freeway and cross the road again and there is a bus stop there to take you back to Boon Lay Interchange.

Having a Singapore Tourist Day pass for the bus and MRT will work wonders and save money specially when you decide to go to another park after Jurong bird park.

All in all this park is a definite activity to do in Singapore for bird lovers or animal lovers alike."
,,Family fun,4.0,,This was a great day out. Don't forget your bathers as there is a water park inside. My two boys loved this. We spent the first part of the day going around the attractions and seeing all the exhibits. The park does look a bit dated but it was still very nice. There is a very nice cafe/restaurant just outside the entrance where we had lunch some very refreshing ice kachang and chendol.
,,Our Expectations Were Very High So We Got disappointed,3.0,,"I quote following from “Wikipedia”,( the encyclopedia) from information’s available on net for knowledge of visitors
“Jurong Bird Park (Chinese: 裕廊飞禽公园; Malay: Taman Burung Jurong; Tamil: ஜுரோங் பறவை பூங்கா), is a tourist attraction in Singapore managed by Wildlife Reserves Singapore. It is a landscaped park, built on the western slope of Jurong Hill. It is located within the Boon Lay Planning Area of the Jurong district and has an area of 202,000 square metres (50 acres)”.I think this basic information is essential for tourists.
Before I left for Singapore I had read reviews about this park and noted that most of the visitors did have positive opinion .But some how I and my family did not find any thing which can hold our interest for long . The organizers holds three shows at fixed time named as “High Flyers Show”: .;”Lunch with Parrots” and “King of the Skies Show” .As I was late for first show so I can not make any comment ;We went for “Lunch With Parrots” but it was so boring that we walked away ; we attended “Kings of the Skies” show: which we liked . Here in this show lasting about 30 minutes visitors can watch eagles, hawks and falcons, fly in aerial loops on the signals/instructions’ of handlers and soar above the spectators and over tree tops .The handlers try to make the show more interesting by birds performing some complicated acts and involving the spectators in these acts In my view visitors will enjoy these bird “flying formations” show specially children and kids.
The tram-rail takes visitors around the park ;one can get down on fixed station/stoppage see the birds /enclosures /attractions and again board the train with same ticket .Usually visitors prefer this mode of transport as park is spread over a very large area but if one want to see birds and its activities in detail ; spend full day here and do not take a tram-rail ride for the purpose; walk around the park leisurely .There are large number and verity of birds in different enclosures ;some common and some uncommon
Last but not the least whole park ; enclosures and area could have been better maintained and more attraction to be added .
We went with great expectations but found nothing extraordinary"
,,World's largest Bird Park: Good education cum entertainment for kids and adults!,5.0,,Birds were well trained for the shows. It takes a good full day to your thoroughly. Otherwise a flying visit can be done in half day. Very well maintained and probably one of its kind in the world.
,,Excellent beautiful set up lovely place,5.0,,I really enjoyed my day at the bird park a credit too them beautifully set out the birds are well cared for and have a good environment to live in loved it.
,,Spread your wings and fly.... to Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"This was one of our favourite attractions in Singapore. I am not a bird lover and I was blown away by the number of areas and the 100s of different birds on show at the park.

The layout is easy together around, for example their is an area for owls, different parrots and even an area for prehistoric birds. This gave a lot of variety and spread out your day.

The birds of prey, the pelican talk and the Birds of paradise shows are a must see, they show how well trained these beautiful birds are and it is all very interactive with the audience.

After one of the shows, you are invited to go into the research centre, which shows you incubators and where a lot of birds are growing up.

This is a must see, and is easily accessible by bus."
,,Bird lover's paradise,5.0,,"Jurong bird park visit is a must for all bird lovers visiting Singapore,If one is in Singapore for more than a day and would also like to visit the zoo the park hopper special package makes sense. One not only saves money but also if you book on line and take a along a print out then you avoid standing in line to buy the ticket which at times can be very trying.

Entrance of Jurong bird park is beautiful, you are greeted by a tulips grown on the sides There is a tram service charges for which are included in the hopper special package, the tram takes you around the park halting at different points where you can see the birds ,and also buy snacks and cold drinks and use the toilets. Weather being humid one needs to have liquids from time to time. do remember to carry your Umbrella's to save you from scorching sun or rain .

The park offers you an oppurtunity to see the birds from very close as these birds do not fly away if you go near them.There are shows which are included in your ticket ,these shows are very informative and interesting.Remember to take your seats atleast half an hour before the show starts specially on weekends and holidays

The park also has a water fall which is worth a visit."
,,Maybe I went with expectations,3.0,,"This is a zoologist's paradise. I miss my uncle so much who devoted his life to students and zoology. Though this is my 3 or 4 th visit in the last 3 months, I still kind of like the parrot paradise enclosure, flamingos and the owl enclosure. The tropical bird show is truly a delight for any new comer. Kids love it. My daughter was at awe looking at the birds which were artificially picturized to her during her lunch and dinner tantrums.....for me the zoo is a more stress buster than the bird park."
,,Lost its lustre,2.0,,I was here 20 years ago and loved it. There were orangutans which were really fun. Now the place seems tired. Even the monorail is not working. Staff are still friendly and helpful. It is time for more birds and add some reptiles or an extreme makeover. It's a long way out and precious time can be better spent around Marina Bay and the gardens.
,,Well maintained park... but nothing great........ its a waste of time...,2.0,,Visited somewhere in June 2012. Too humid..... Well maintained... There is one show of birds.... quite good.... but couldn't enjoy as it was too hot 7 humid... If you really want to spend time.... go somewhere else....
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,Absolutely loved the African aviary. Wonderful to sit in the rainforest and watch the birds. Lovely day out.
,,Its really a bird park and also pools amphitheater is entertaining,4.0,,Its really beautiful and the place is filled with colors. Amazing beautiful creatures all over the place. Even when you are leaving there are a bunch of birds and there is a waterfall also. I clicked one of the most amazing pictures of my mom and dad here. Eat well before you come here and you will enjoy your day like anything. Lot of beauty and weather is amazing. Pools Amphitheater ais also one big attraction where in the birds are meant to do a lot of things and they call lot of volunteers from the crowd. It will be amazing ot be selected. I sat on 3rd bench from the front. we reached amphitheater a bit early would have spent more time around this. The guide that we did was average and they carry a sign with them and some people might be included in your group but dont worry be with that guide and you will enjoy the paths. There was a lake also where we saw many birds. Carry a SLR and you will find a lot of facebook pictures to make your friends jealous. Whatever changres were there it was al lincluded in our package. The people who attend there the guide or the manager tells you everything which is included and what is not.
,,Beautiful flying creatures,4.0,,"If you love bird's and want to see them all and learn about them, this is a very good place to visit. they have loads of varities of birds. A lot of shows are also there which displays action by trained birds and give interesting facts also about the birds. inside the park there is an african fall also which is very beautiful. a must visit for nature lovers."
,,Not as good as zoo but still good,3.0,,"Having been spoilt a bit with the zoo last weekend, the bird park this weekend just didn't quite hit the very good mark....but it was still good.

why not a 4 dot rating.....call me old fashioned but There wasn't enough water for the penguins to have a decent dip...the owls suffered the same with small enclosures for flight..... BUT...The bird park did other averies really well and the waterfall avery was fantastic... Just mind the bird poop on your head.... , sensibly there are wash basins around there, but take some tissues and wipes and don't worry about it! The birds are amazing in this part of park.

Also, do visit the small(tiny) research centre there, well worth it as it has all the incubators and hatchlings they are rearing and weaning.... Amazing... All stages of a chicks life cycle... Can't say a baby parrot is pretty but it was really interesting to see it all.

If you have an aversion to the small of ammonia the bird park may not be for you...with so many birds in one place, in some areas the smell gets strong.

Finally, we missed the shows... But I hear they are great so maybe if we had seem them(around 10.30 am and again around 3.30 pm) it would have been 4 dots."
,,Attractive and entertaining Bird Park,5.0,,"In my second visit to Jurong Bird Park, I came with my husband and 2 kids. I could tell that the web site of Jurong Bird Park was really informative so we could get so many information before we went there. I could even download the park map from the web! Therefore I could arrange our schedule in the park combined with the show schedule. I even planned it one month before we departed to Singapore.
We did had a great time there. My kids really loved those flamingoes, macaus and also those adorable penguins that they were really hoping to see it. They even had a chance to feed the penguins. Beside that, their shows were really must to see! Very attractive and entertaining. Just don't miss the shows! And I could also tell that this park was developing in a great way since my first visit so many years ago. Jurong Bird Park was really a very beautiful place to visit in Singapore."
,,Beautiful & large birds park,4.0,,We visited this beautiful & large birds park for the second time after our first visit with the kids 6 years ago. This time we visited this park with my sisters-in-law & niece. We bought some combined tickets with the tickets for the Zoo. Therefore we just arrived in this park after lunch & missed some attractive shows. My wife & I had the impression that this park was more beautiful 6 years ago although there were some more collections of birds compared with 6 years ago :-)
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"We took the MRT and then a bus to the Bird Park. The Jurong Bird Park is very well laid out,lush green with shrubs and trees of all shapes and sizes, lake ,man-made waterfall, and above all beautiful colorful birds chirping all around you. Its the best bird park I have ever seen."
,,Amazing variety of birds and an amazing place!,4.0,,"A memorable place indeed. Id reckon Its always rejuvenating to be close to nature, especially when its well maintained. Some of the attractions I found interesting was the bird show, the tons of pink Flamingo's in a huge water body, the mono rail ride, the photo sessions with large birds etc...Feels pretty nice. I would definitely recommend this place for nature and bird aficionado. And not to miss, you can go gala if you’re into photography!"
,,Loved feeding the birds,4.0,,"Must reach the bird park by 10am atleast. This is to ensure that one can catch up on the bird show as well. Took a tram ride uphill, which one can also walk but be reminded its a steep journey. Can get down at various stations between the tram ride and explore the surroundings and catch the next tram, if there is vacant seat. Loved the flamingoes and different variety of birds but the best we enjoyed was the bird feeding. It was an experience to have the parrot sit on your arms and feed on the food. The whole area was filled with different coloured parrots which made the whole scene appear beautiful. Enjoyed galore."
,,Jurong Bird park- ideal place for children and the young at heart,5.0,,"Jurong Bird park is a must see attraction for the visitors of Singapore. There are numerous birds of brilliant colors. You can buy some bird feed at the Lori's loft and feed the birds. The birds perching on your hand and feeding is an unforgettable experience. You can also see a white peacock in that enclosure.
There are a number of shows where the birds perform wonderful stuff to entertain the guests. A parrot like bird counting numbers from one to ten in English and Chinese is a marvel. Birds of prey is another interesting show. On the whole , certainly worth the visit. It would be sensible to buy a package ticket covering both the zoo and the Bird Park to save on cost."
,,"The Good, the Bad, and the Birdies",3.0,,"Go on the East West line to Boon Lay station/bus interchange and hop on bus 194 to Jurong Bird Park. The park begins their activities (such as feeding sessions and shows) as early as 10 am, so better go early if you don't want to miss anything. Btw, Jurong Bird Park is located far from Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, so although you buy a park hopper ticket, you might want to schedule your visit on a different day. Do check out their website for shows and feeding times, and get a map of the park (which includes showtimes and feeding sessions) once you arrive at Jurong Bird Park. FYI: Lunch with Parrots is not a feeding time for parrots, it's an exclusive show featuring some parrots, only for visitors who are willing to pay about $20 for buffet lunch at the Songbird Terrace restaurant.

The good: the park definitely has a great collection of birds. You'll have a lot of fun feeding the lories ($3 for one small cup of food for the birds), watching the fantastic shows featuring the most beautiful and trained birds, or simply walking around to see so many different kinds of birds.

The bad: the park obviously need some serious maintenance to keep up with the Zoo, Night Safari, and the new River Safari. The World of Darkness is probably the worst exhibit, because even in the darkness you can see weathered paint in the owls' display. Must figure out ways to keep the cleanliness of the restrooms as well, because it's so filthy.

The birdies: They seem to be very well taken care of, and apparently the park has been quite successful in their breeding programs. However, happy as the birds may seem, they do need a better place to live in."
,,Personal Tour at the bird park,5.0,,"Living in Singapore we have of course visited the bird park several times. We had never however booked a personal tour. As my 11 year old nephew, an avid wildlife lover, was visiting this summer, we decided to book the ""Bird's Eye"" tour. What a lovely experience it turned out to be. Our guide, Madelyn, was pleasant knowledgeable, patiently answered my 11 year olds endless questions & share some exciting insights with him. I would highly recommend this, for anyone with kids."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"If visiting Singapore then don't miss it. Its a lovely park. Don't forget to watch their bird show, its amazing."
,,The flamingoes of Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is a sprawling bird park at the base of Jurong Hill. The African Waterfall Aviary is an enclosed aviary with the tallest man-made waterfall. The park has pelicans, herons, parrots, macaws, parakeets, vultures, eagles, lories and penguins. The penguins are housed in an air-conditioned room with ice added to the pool of water. There are two shows entitled Kings of the Skies. Here the bird keepers show the tricks done by vultures and falcons. This park is worth a visit. You can view my video on You tube under the website:
http://www.youtube.com/my_videos_annotate?v=AHKmnyKPlZs"
,,Not too bad experience,4.0,,"We brought a family package to go to bird park as the kids are excited about the animals...however the place is a bit run down. But the kids still have a blast at the small water play area.

The eagle sanctuary is the highlight for my son! except that you have to climb a steep slope to get there (note- the park is built of a hillside).

NOt easy to access if you are not driving."
,,Good for visiting in the morning for 3-4 hours.,5.0,,"Children love this place especially the penguin enclosure. It is basically a round trip to be taken and stations on which one can get on and off the buggies. The birds of different types are to be found near these stations.
We loved the Eagles show. Picture taken near the entrance is rather expensive but we are enjoying it a lot now."
,,"I was told its ""the best trip ever"" by my 8 year old godson!",5.0,,"With friends from out of town with an 8 year old boy (who is so into birds) this was a special treat. From an organisation point of view, all worked very well - bought the tickets online including a special VIP buggy tour. Madelyn was our guide, who waited for us at the gate and took us for 1 1/2 hours through the park. Stopping at the main attractions (which is a good way to get to know the lay of land for a personal look later on). We had 3 special feeding times - one of them with with live worms - yiiikkkkeee. It was such great fun. The park itself is a nice mix of 'cages' to large Avery's , most of the time you don't even notice when you enter an enclosed zone. Our guide explained everything in detail and added more knowledge to our very knowledgable 8 year old who knew most birds. A lovely outing and unique as not that many countries have bird parks - zoos yes, but not bird parks. There are plenty of chances to stop off for a rest or drink and many different 'shows' to keep the young ones entertained."
,,Excellent Bird park with amazing shows,4.0,,"My kids really enjoyed the bird park. The live shows are the main attractions of the park. The park has huge collection of birds from all over the world. The park is quite huge but has limited shelters, in case of rains, which is very usual in Singapore."
,,Great Family Outing Destination,5.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is an excellent choice for a day out with the family. While most people think that the destination is for kids, the park, the display and the activities offered is interesting and engaging to people of any age. Thoughtfully designed and exquisitely maintained, the park is spread over a large area and houses birds in different environments. While there is a tram that takes a circuit around the park, it is recommended that you walk. That way, you dont miss any of the enclosures. Make sure you have 3 - 4 hours planned for this outing and carry plenty of water.

The park also has a bird show where the inmates perform brilliantly. Check for the timing as you enter the park. The show is free but can be crowded. Make sure you find your way and locate a good seat for the show about 15min or so in advance.

The park is well connected by buses and is a fun place to be. Definitely worth the visit if you are going to Singapore.

If you are planning to go to the zoo or night safari or any combination of these along with the bird park, you can get cheaper tickets if you book online. You also get free tram ride pass if you book online. The ticket is valid for a certain period and not a particular day and hence you have flexibility for changing plans. It is recommended you get the ticket online anyways since the ticket counters can be crowded on weekends and holidays. You definitely save some time at the entrance!"
,,Very nice,5.0,,"It takes quite a lot of time to go to the Jurong Bird Park by MRT and bus and the park is huge, so you should have enough time if you want to see everything. An astonishing selection of beautiful and interesting birds from tropical and other regions. Feeding the Loris was big fun (i fed the big green parrot too but he's a cheeky guy, so better watch your finger) as was the bird show (i guess it was called ""high flyers"", twice a day)."
,,Fun few hours with kids,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park was great fun with our 4- and 5- year old kids. The park is quite big but we purchased the train rides and that helped a lot. If you have little ones I recommend either renting a wagon or paying extra for the train (or bring your own stroller), otherwise, expect a lot of walking and tired little ones. They had 2 shows and both were fantastic!
Our kids enjoyed the Lory Aviary the most, though. It was more interactive for them than the shows. For 3 Sing dollars you ca get a cup of nectar. The lories flock to you as soon as you hold the cup out. Watch out for the larger lories as they will try to take the cup away from you. One took it from my daughter, much to her dismay. Also, their nails were quite sharp so it's best if little kids wear something with sleeves.
There's also a splash area for kids - birds of play. We didn't have time to enjoy it but it looked like it would be fun for kids.
Overall, the bird park is beautifully laid out with tropical theme throughout. The birds have nice, big spaces to fly around in. It's definitely worth a visit!"
,,Colorful bird,5.0,,"We visited Jurong Bird Park to see the collection of bird they have. The one I love most was the Scarlet Ibis bird. The African aviary was not too much fun because there was not many bird to watch. The photo session with the bird near the entrance was not much fun also since they only let a pair of small love birds on a wood stick to hold, not the macaws. While in Bali bird park they let us hold the big birds such as cockatoo and macaws as well. The girl staff at the photo session was not so friendly either, no smile at all."
,,Birds from all round the Globe,5.0,,"SE Asian countries are full of Bird Parks whether a small one in Sentosa or in Thailand, etc. But as they claim, one of the biggest bird park is Jurong...I totally agree. You don't need to visit any other Bird parks if you have seen this.

Whether it's Asian, SE Asia, birds from Europe or Antarctica or else where, they have rarely missed any and even if they have missed, they have covered too much. Even in owls, there were many types to be seen and that too in dark room. There was a complete section of Asian Birds, etc. etc..You will see one of the highest man made Water falls in the African section. Aquatic animals too are a good attraction.

If you have a child with you, please, please avail the pram they give on rent just prior to entrance. I just took it on my kid's insistence and then praised myself for the decision throughout the 3-4 hours journey. Camera with full charge is must so that you don't miss the picturesque and mesmerizing views of colorful world. The mini train available inside the park is good and staff quite helpful.

The Bird show are worth not missing. Plan your views in the park such that you are at the Bird show stadium at least 15 minutes prior to show to capture best seat else prepare to stand at the back for next 30 minutes...Overall a Wonderful experience and I have decided not to visit any other Bird Park in region after seeing this one.

Best is to club this visit with Night Safari. There are buses available from Jurong Bird Park to night safari and the last one leaves at 5pm. So, you will cover 2 places at one go. Please read my review on Night Safari for further continuity"
,,You need one Full day to enjoy the Fun,5.0,,"The highlight is of course the birds, but to me, it is the interaction between the birds and kids. It can be the bird shows, feeding the Lories or even ""chasing"" the peacocks or sometimes mandarin ducks (ooops).

Bird park is small, but you really need one full day to visit all the enclosures.
We love the Breeding corner, with the incubators and real chicks weeks old. Kids love the Eagle and Vulture shows, and of course the water-play area.

Families will enjoy a walk in African Waterfall aviary, birds spotting before we reach the waterfall. It might be artificial, but the water droplets are cooling.

Do not miss feeding the Lory Loft. The Lories are so friendly (and hungry), they will fly real close to you. Kids are thrilled. We caught the ibis feeding time, and it was spectacular to see the fish feeding frenzy.

Penguins need no introduction, kids notice the puffins. We do miss the overhead monorail, it seems to have been decommissioned."
,,Wonderful time for kids,5.0,,"Went with my extended family and we had a very good time and the kids enjoyed a lot.
Few key points to note.

* It is quite a distant place if you have to travel from east or central part of Singapore so plan your visit accordingly.
* You may need approximately 4 to 5 hours here to enjoy the park fully
* Dont miss the ""High flyers show"" at any cost, very good show. The other one ""Kings of the skies show"" is not that great.
* If you are vegetarian, better carry food from home (like what we did) as not many varieties will be available for you
* Check whether before you travel as all the shows are weather permitted only and dont get disappointed.
* Lorry loft (Place where you feed the birds) one of my favorite spot will be closed at 5:30 PM, so plan your visit accordingly (I was disappointed when we missed it last time)
* All the shows inside are free (of course you have to pay for the entrance of the park)
* I felt that I should not have bought tram ride as I dint use it at all, the entire park is a bit big but definitely walkable (my 3 year old son walked the entire distance by walk without complaining) it was very crowded in the tram station and also I anyways had to see the places around the park so ended up walking rather than waiting in tram
* We spent around a good 5 to 6 hours including meal time (with kids you know how long it will take :)) and we watched 2 shows and managed to cover almost 80% of the park
* Better call them and check about kids area (Birds of play) is closed for maintenance or not (it was unfortunately closed to our disappointment)"
,,An enjoyable day out..,5.0,,"We purchased the ticket that was the general bird park admittance inclusive of a seat on the little train.

The train ride is a great way to see the park. It drops you at various parts around the grounds and you can walk to the different displays in your own time. Once finished viewing the display, you jump back on the next train and jump off at the next display again. With the humidity in Singapore this is a great way of getting around and cutting out some of the walking that is required.

There are several cafes along the way if you want something to eat or drink. We had an enjoyable day, some of the birds here are spectacular. We also enjoyed the penguin enclosure. A taxi was easy enough to catch on the way home. You can also hire little plastic carts to pull the kids around in if they aren’t up to all the walking. A good day out"
,,Must visit,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park, is a tourist attraction in Singapore. you can enjoy close interactions with a birds at feeding sessions and be tickled by their show-stopping antics in thrilling bird shows. There are various shows at several venues and at any cost, you must not miss High Flyer of Skies which is my personal favorite. It showcases the world's largest number of performing birds in a single act. You can also opt for a tram ride to see different exhibits. Overall a must place to go. There are 5,000 birds of 380 species in Jurong Bird Park."
,,Good Leisure Outing,5.0,,A lovely place in Singapore to enjoy the varied birds in the park. Very well maintained and has a host of events happening which keep you busy. It is well accessible for WC visitors.
,,Fantastic........,5.0,,"A full range of international birds especially macaws, flamingo,hornbills,spoonbills etc. There are 3 shows in open amphitheaters which are a must watch ....."
,,every bird under the sun,4.0,,huge variety of birds. It was very hot and a huge space to explore took us a good half day to get around and I am still not sure we saw everything. great place to take kids.
,,Great Bird Park,5.0,,Super nice Bird Park. Lots of birds to see and hold. This was our 2nd time there and just love it. Highly recommend going there and Singapore Zoo.
,,Blast of colour at the Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"Super, mindboggling and a riot of colours. Amazing collection of birds, wonderfully thought out and informative. Plan for 4 hrs, take the tram ride, get down at various points, walk around and again take the ride. Camera is a must. The Lory Loft, the shows are wonderful - check out the timings beforehand. The Hawk show can be missed if indeed one has to keep out one show because of lack of time. And yes, the rest rooms seem to be lifted straight out of 5 star hotels...lots of them available so no problem for ladies and kids. Wear good and comfortable footwear as one will have to do some walking around."
,,good place for kids,4.0,,Very nice place for kids.a lot of variety of birds.The shows are amazing and very informative. Make sure to get down from tram and walk around
,,Excellent Bird Park,5.0,,"Take time to visit this Bird park, nothing less than 3 hrs would suffice. Take the tram ride to get an overall perspective then plan your route and walk to enclosures. There is very good Splash pool for kids and adults alike hence dont forget to carry swimming costumes or a spare pair of dress.
World's tallest man-made waterfall near the African Aviary Enclosure is a must visit.
The Highlight of the Bird Park is q 25min Bird Show @ 11:30am which is very good. there is a very Big Penguin Park, Owl Park, Pink Cranes Park etc etc, Overall a great place to visit"
,,Wonderful,4.0,,"Jurong bird park is a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend a visit when in Singapore. We took the train around to start with so we could get orientated. We then did a stroll right around and caught a couple of shows. This really is a beautiful bird park with a large variety of birds, it is well laid out and the enclosures are large and natural. The African enclosure is a highlight with a man made waterfall. Don't forget to visit the penguins near the entrance too, super cute and airconditined. A lovely day out."
,,Missable,2.0,,"I have been to this attraction in 2002 as well, but the experience during this May visit was not good. The Monorail has been taken off but they have introduced a tram.
The birds were far less and the bird shows were not at all exciting. The Eagles and vulture show was more of a catwalk kind of show.. showing this is this and that is that. and was over in 10-12 minutes. Earlier in 2002 it was , I remember for about half an hour."
,,"Osong Ligaw goes to Jurong Bird Park, SG",5.0,,"Enjoying looking at these birds will cost an adult S$20 or Php 660 and a cub S$13 or Php429. I'm not sure though if it includes the Tram ride because ours had. This is different from the Bird's Eye View VIP Buggy Tour which can only cater a family. We did not take the tram ride since we wanted to enjoy the park on our own time. So, yes, we walked around the 20 hectare paradise!

Jurong Bird Park is Asia's largest bird park. Its 20 hectare space is home to 5,000+++ birds from different species. If you really wanna enjoy the park, and if you have kids, it' better to allot a whole day for JBP.

Its exhibits include *Penguin Coast *World of Darkness (Owls) *Pools Amphitheatre (High Flyers Show) *Heliconia Walk *Spoonbills *Shore birds *Scarlet Ibis *Royal Ramble *Hornbills and Toucans *Window on Paradise *Lory Loft *Birds of Prey *Jungle Jewels *Southeast Asian Birds *Mandarin Duck *Bird Discovery Centre *Dinosaur Descendants *Swan Lake *African Waterfall Aviary *Parrot Paradise *Pelican Cove *Shoebill **Flamingo Lake *Songbird Terrace *Riverine *Wetlands *Macaw Island *Flamingo Pool *Hawk Walk (Kings of the Skies Show) and *Breeding Research Centre.

Most of the birds in the park are species I did not know even exist! Or birds that my human has just admired at Nat Geo. My human was totally starstruck with the exhibits. *ehem! flamingo! *ehem Scarlet ibis! *ehem! Vultures!

My human also enjoyed paying S$2 to feed three fish to penguins and another S$2 to feed colourful lories at Lory loft. Be careful when feeding the birds though because some tourists would distract ""your birds"" so that they could feed them themselves. I guess this is to provide a better photo op. But of course, my human did not let them ruin her moment.

Besides these, there are also shows everyone can enjoy. There is the ""King of the Skies Show"" which features falcons, owls, and oh-my-god vultures, the ""High Flyers Show"" where parrots and lories do some aeronautical tricks, and the ""Lunch with the Parrots"" where humans....uhm...have lunch with the parrots. The latter requires purchase of food and beverage. You simply eat lunch while several parrots perform a number of tricks.

Young children can also enjoy ""Birds of Play"" at JBP. This is a big bird themed water playground! This is not a pool so parents need not to worry about their children getting drowned. Also, there are Life guards around. Of course, parents are welcome to enjoy this playground with their kids. Watch out for the big bucket!!"
,,Stay a little bit longer,5.0,,"This is a great attraction. There is a lot to see here. Take the tram to have a look but take the time to hop off and visit the individual areas. The shows are definitely worth watching. Our tour was arranged through Destination Asia and the travel agent booked us for the 1.30pm tour. By the time this tour left the departure point and fought the traffic we arrived right on 3pm, then were told the bus would leave at 4.45pm. We stayed on well past this so we could see it all. If taking a tour, go for the early morning to give yourself time without being rushed. Don't miss the conservation nursery tucked away beside the birds of prey show area."
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"Give the tram a miss unless you are not capable of walking. You can be very near to the birds especially the hornbills, eagles, macaws etc. you can feed the loris honey water for 3$ and they would be all over you. it was fun and worth it. when you walk and can click photos too. The tram just passes by"
,,Birds Birds and more Birds,4.0,,"We went to the Jurong Bird Park from Bencoolan after finding a 2 park special for $39 each person. Our first stop was Jurong Bird Park. This package includes coach transport for an additional $4 charge pp.

There was a vast range of birdlife and was extremely colourful and entertaining. Don’t miss the bird show where they have a remarkable parrot that can speak in several languages and is fun to watch This show has a finale showcases over 90 birds on stage at the same time.
It is an easy trail to follow and we spent between 4 – 5 hours. It may sound a bit boring but we found it worth-while, even without kids. If you are looking for a days entertainment, this is a great start."
,,Enjoyful Experience,5.0,,Went to the bird park as there is promotion going on. The zoo has improved a lot and there are more interactions between ppl with the birds. Just disappointed that there isnt monorail train that used to be working few years back :)
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"Jurong is well worth a visit for anybody interested in the birdlife that can be found in the malaysian region, the park also has a great vatriety of other species from around the world.Seeing the hornbills up close was a highlight for us as were some of the walk through avairies.The park took a good 2.5-3 hours to walk around so bring your walking shoes there are lots of awesome photo oportunities.We caught a taxi from joo chiat in the east of Singapore to the park for around $20 Aud much advised after a day walking through the park. All up jurong is a great place to visit."
,,Good collection of birds!,3.0,,"Jurong did not live up to its hype as far as I am concerned - I think it is a case of marketing outshining the product! :)
The flamingoes and parakeets are beautiful and a riot of color. The pelicans, toucans, hornbills and the storks are also pretty. Make sure you click these.But the African rainforest aviary, the 'tallest man-made waterfall in an aviary' was not very impressive. Also, the Hawk Walk show, though it did showcase some handsome owls, eagles and vultures, was rather insipid and too short.
The park is on undulating land - walking around in the heat is going to tire you out - so unless you are used to this, do not club the bird park visit with any other attraction. The tram rides do help you avoid some walking, but they are not 'hop-on-hop-off' - you can get on and off only from designated stations. So if you want to visit some bird enclosures, you have to walk backwards/forwards from the station where they dropped you off, visit the enclosure and walk back!"
,,so fun and exciting,5.0,,"first of all, the location is far from the city centre. but we weren't regret it. The park is not that huge, but it's very neat and clean. There are many birds that we haven't see it before like flaminggo, penguin, scarlet ibis, macaw, etc and they have a very beautiful colour.
The ""high flyer"" attraction is very good (must see attraction), we were so exciting and still discussed it after the show.
Should I recommend this bird park to others : Sure, one of the must see attraction in singapore."
,,A Wonderfully educative and entertaining Avian collection in good environs,5.0,,"The journey involves a 10 minute bus ride (No 194 terminates at the Park) from the Boon Lay Bus Station/ Interchange (co-located with the MRT).
Right from the entrance, the colours and sounds captivate you, with a tempting photo op holding birds right at the start. Like at the Zoo, I strongly recommend arriving almost at opening time, taking a few minutes to familiarize with the layout (map free at entrance) and the various feeding times, before setting out in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. Taking the tram is NOT recommended (unless you have a problem walking), as you will miss the time needed at each enclosure. A well-timed walk through the entire park, with adequate time at each enclosure and all shows/ feed sessions possible will take anywhere from 4-5 hours. Must see sessions are the kite feeding (at about 10 am, located on the right of the entrance) and the aviary show, on the left of the entrance. All areas are easy to find, well marked and the mp is a pleasure to peruse.
If you love birds, you will find the opportunity to feed lories in their enclosure blissful. Camera and a spare battery is a must have, of course! My daughter at one time had 8 birds all over her! The walk around and the entire trip is not just a tryst with nature and its most colourful inhabitants, but very educative, apart from of course, entertaining. The fact that the birds are kept in largish enclosures as close to their natural habitats is some consolation. The zone where they have small chics being brought up and eggs being incubated is a nice education for the tiny tots. The opportunity to cocoon inside a dummy nest/ egg is seized by kids and adults alike, outside this section, if only for the facebook albums!
Water refill points and toilets are available all through and it is adequate to carry 1-2 bottles of water when you set off, and an umbrella/ cap.
Once done with this, and if you still are up to it, you can make a quick trip across to the Zoo, and wind up with the Night Safari (starts by 7 pm, with queues forming up by 6.15 or so!). We (wife, 10 year old daughter and me) managed to do all three in a day, but yes, it is quite tiring. Do not attempt the combo if you are not physically active and in best of health. May be best to do Jurong and return, and do the Zoo and Night Safari another day, if you have the time."
,,See birds up close,4.0,,"We took MRT then bus to the bird park, very simple and easy to find, return bus to interchange leaves from same stop. The park in some displays needs some work for example the Bald Eagle cage is quite small for their size, obviously this makes them easy to see but you get the feeling they don't get to stretch their wings enough. The free flight display is awesome birds everywhere. There is a water park for children that looks fun, we decided against it as many younger children wearing standard nappies not swimmer ones, but if you look past this the kids would be entertained for hours. Food expensive in park, but good benches if you take your own."
,,Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"My grandson and I thoroughly enjoyed our day at Jurong Bird Park. I liked the way it was set out - you could catch the tram at the entrance for a quick trip around the park to get your bearings and then hop on and off as whenever you wanted. This enabled us to plan to catch the various shows. I would have liked to go on the ""bird feeding tour"" but apparently you have to book ahead for this one :(. We were both captivated by Lory Loft. My grandson was thrilled as the birds climbed all over him feeding from the food bowl purchased for $2.00. Great photo and video opportunity! The African Waterfall Aviary was spectacular and we particularly liked the up close view of penguins at Penguin Coast.
There is plenty here for the entire family to enjoy no matter what age group. Personally I enjoyed this park more than the zoo. We went on a weekday so it was not crowded. The only let down, in my opinion, was the Bongo Burgers Bar. Their offerings were just passable so, if possible, I recommend you pack a picnic basket as there are lockers available for storage etc."
,,Excellent place for all age group,5.0,,"Till now I have been to 3 times to Jurong Bird Park and we have enjoyed a lot every time, so many birds and their show which use to make much people with happy and in few shows they use to ask to guest to come and participate in the show.
There are so many videos available in other website which will give better visual idea."
,,Bird Collection not so much,2.0,,"Actually this is a nice place for family recreation, especially if U have kid(s). If You come from central city of Singapore, you eill feel that this place is very far, takes arround 1 hour. And this place need more variety of birds, since it is on Asia, this place must shows much Asia variety of birds."
,,great for kids and adults alike,5.0,,"My kids and I spend a wonderful day at the bird park. It is our second trip there in three years. They have upgraded it immensely and added several great additions, including a great water park for the kids.

The birds are amazing and we all enjoyed seeing the different species."
,,A must visit,5.0,,"The park is a bit out of town, but for two of us the taxi fare was not excessive, and the park was just superb. We like birds, an important thing if you're considering a visit. We live near a Bird Park in Cornwall UK, which is very good, but Jurong is just amazing. It was so nice to see lively tropical birds in the tropics, rather than sat forlornly in the UK's climate. The highlights for us were the penguins and the Rainbow Lorry's in their huge walk in aviary. The free flying display is not to be missed either. A must visit if you're in Singapore, but it can get very hot 36C the afternoon we went."
,,"excellent, especially with growing up kids",5.0,,"Jurong bird park is must visit during Singapore visit. We loved it. Its good to buy the tickets with a deal along with a ride on the Singapore flyer or a Night Safari visit or a visit to the Singapore zoo.
Lots of colorful birds all along and great shows too!"
,,SPlash area fantastic for kids,4.0,,This brand new splash area here is fantastic for kids. They will love it. Also a dry area with swings galore and lots more. A great afternoon out for the kids.
,,"Good, but not amazing",4.0,,"This place is definitely worth a visit - huge landscaped area and an incredible variety of birds. It is clean but needs a little bit of TLC and upkeep here and there. The shows were pretty ordinary but we really enjoyed walking around the exhibits, so I'm really glad we went but I didn't walk away thinking it was amazing.

And remember your water and sunscreen!"
,,"Come, fall in love",5.0,,"I love this park. One of the best attractions of Singapore, I made it to this place both the times I visited Singapore.
It's clean, it's well maintained and it has more birds than you would wish to see. Providing the birds with their natural habitat, you don't really feel like you are visiting them caged. The tropical rain forest is a must see with its occasional rain and thunder with birds flying free in a man-made forest. Loved all the show. The observation area where they have fascinating facts of birds is very interesting for kids and adults alike. Loved feeding the birds.
There is lots of opportunity for pictures, so don't forget your camera. Cotton clothes would be highly recommended because it gets very humid in certain parts of the day. Walking shoes will be an advantage. There are also trams available here, so in case you are tired, they can give you a ride.
Now, obviously this place wouldn't be the hot spot for people who don't have a spot for birds."
,,Jurong Bird park,4.0,,"Jurong Bird park is a great place to visit with family. We saw many variety of birds... especially in the Lory loft we enjoyed a lot...we were allowed to feed the birds... we can also have a lunch with the beautiful parrots.... The birds of prey was also a very good one... the pelicans was wonderful one too... we also have many shows , in that High Flyers show is worth of watching...
But dining is not worth for our money inside the park... better we can have it outside the park like bongo burgers...Hawk cafe etc."
,,"Birds, Birds, and more Birds",4.0,,"Don't go here if you don't like birds (obviously). But if you do, they have plenty. Several separate enclosures with a nice variety of species. Well laid out in a circular form. Tram available or just walk. Some overly friendly and tame birds will voluntarily sit on your shoulder and do their business (!). Good photography but be quick. Be aware that it is not really close to anything, so be prepared for a long taxi ride - about 45 minutes from downtown."
,,Well worth a visit if you have a few spare hours.,4.0,,"Not as good as the bird park in kuala lumpur, but still worth a visit.
Great variety ofbirds from all corners of the globe, an absolute highlight for me was seeing the very rate shoe bill stalk from Africa, never dreamed I would see one, so made my trip worth while.
Great photo opportunities when feeding the lorries.
A shuttle bus is available for 5 dollars which takes you back into town, very handy."
,,World class attraction for all ages,5.0,,"This really is a bird's paradise. The grounds and aviary enclosures are beautifully maintained and it is easy to get a good view of an extensive assortment of brilliantly coloured bird life. While there is a tram ride around the park, walking is easy and the best way to see all the amazing sights. Do stop at Lorry Loft, a walk through 9 storey high enclosure the offers 360 elevated views of the lush greenery and the colourful lorikeets will fly down and drink from little bowls of nectar. The High Flyers Show is fun and interactive. Our three grandchildren loved the water playground (so come prepared with swimwear) with water slides, giant tipping bucket and more. This is a ""do not miss"" attraction in Singapore!"
,,Colorful day at Jurong Bird Park,3.0,,"Jurong Bird Park, we saw all kinds of birds one couldn’t ever imagine. We first took a monorail ride around the park before we explored the area on our own. At least, that already gave us an idea on how big the place was.

Birds of prey were inside cages while the ones that thrive in wetlands are kept in the open. Try to catch the birds show at the Pools Amphitheatre and the pelicans’ feeding time.

Don’t miss:
To feed the lories at the Lory Loft. They are my favorites! You don’t have to go after them. They’ll come to you when they see the cup in your hand.

Hey, you should know that:
You’ll remember Happy Feet when you see the Penguins."
,,Lovely and Lush Greenery,3.0,,"The range of birds to see is wide , my personal favorite the Macaw's were in abundance and there is a session where you can have your photo taken with them .
The caged birds eagle's,toucan's,horn bills and macaw's were in cages that could be built more spacious for them to fly as the larger birds looked crammed .
Informative description regarding the species are available on the boards in several languages.
There is an open area where one can walk through to see the birds as well as purchase nectar to feed them .But the building needs a fresh coat of paint .
The only area that was disappointing was the owl area as they were kept in a dark room in small areas and artificial surrounding such as artificial painted tress and snow which I reckon its not their natural environment .
It can rain heavily and be humid so do wear light clothing and comfortable shoes ."
,,Avoid Visiting on Rainy Days,3.0,,"Nice park for first-timers and bird-lovers. Unfortunately, not worth visiting on a rainy day. It gets really hot and humid, plus you just get sticky and wet from the open tram rides! Avoid, avoid, avoid going on a rainy day."
,,Don't support this!,2.0,,"Want to see Large Eagles in small cages or Great Owls, alone, in a dark, small room?
This is not tolerable and I am saddened that I fell for the attraction !

This park needs to reconsider their strategy.
Agreed that the main attractions are being well looked after, thus a 2 star rating, but I would suggest you take your money elsewhere if you are in Singapore !"
,,Good day out,4.0,,"I visited with my daughter in April. Was not too sure what to expect after reading some mixed reviews but on the whole was pleasantly surprised.
We went during the middle of the week and the park was rather quiet - great for being able to see everything in one day and get hands on with the birds. The Lorry loft was great, probably the best part of the day. Very greedy birds desperately wanting more and more of the liquid bird food!
I would recommend following their ""suggested itinerary"" we followed the afternoon itinerary which meant we could walk from one place to the other and not be disappointed by missing a show or demonstration. Don't think we could have occupied a whole day but that may have been partly due to the weather - it was a very very hot day!
The keepers were knowledgable and friendly. One of our first encounters with the birds involved going to see the cormorants. Unfortunately one was dead, floating in the pool with the other birds looking on. I was able to find a keeper and they went in to remove the dead bird swiftly.
The number of parrots etc was impressive. I was less impressed by the size of their cages though!
The same can be said for the Hornbills.
The shows were good but we were not able to see the ""High Flyers"" due to technical issues???
As a Biologist myself I was really looking forward to visiting the Breeding and Research centre. I was disappointed that this only involved going into a room and looking through windows at egg rotators and a few very young birds in incubators. There was no one to talk to or ask questions.
One major piece of advice is to slap on loads of insect repellant. I was bitten alive and spent the rest if my visit to Singapore feeling rather embarrassed about that state of my legs lol"
,,"If you a bird lover, you will simply fall in love with this place",5.0,,"Although I haven't been to many bird parks but still I can assume that this one may be amongst one of the best I will ever come across. The park has got superb collection of birds, quite a lot of birds. They are also doing a lot for the birds which are on the verge of extinction and the kind of effort that is put in by them is definitely remarkable.
You must have min. 4 hours to make the most of this park.
carry lot of water because it gets quite humid in there."
,,"Shows & lorry loft are brilliant, avoid rainy day",4.0,,"I had a fix schedule in Singapore, and the day we chose bird park, it was raining. (whole day)

The kings of the skies show was cancelled, so we saw only one show(high flyer). But that was real good, the birds are colorful, hosts are great. We all liked it. Despite the rain they managed to complete the show, though they had to delay it.

Next we hop on to the tram (no Pano rail), and got down at the Ist stop, and headed to lorry loft. What an experience. For 3$ food(which you can share), you can have a blast with birds(all parrots like). They do not mind sitting on your head. I could easily spend 1+ hour in this only.

There are penguins as well.(They are not birds, are they?)

The regular park was okay, you can cover it in 1-2.5 hours excluding shows and loft.

If you really intend to go to each cage and see the birds, I suggest you to not take tram ride ticket. Its not a very big park, and tram has just two stops as such.

Overall a fun experience, but make sure to check rain."
,,Starter for birder in you,5.0,,Execellent ..well managed and gives you feel of the Jungle.... Good place to take kids and give them first encounter for admiring the world of feathered friends..
,,Aviland away from the Urban Jungle,4.0,,"Just a few minutes MRT ride from my place in Little India to the Boon Lay MRT Station..a short bus ride and there I was with some few first-timers in Singapore to escape the April heat of the downtown area into the large aviaries and greeneries of Jurong.....the trip was relaxing, stress-busting, refreshing in addition to being educational on the subject of Class Aves...it was the first time I experienced being with a large flock of flamingos, lories darting here and there, seeing penguins in a semi aquarium setting, coming up close with a variety of doves, hornbills and toucans...watching a show where the stars of the show were the feathered inhabitants of the park....an enjoyable tram-ride....getting into an aviary that looked like an African rain forest...and spending some dollars in the souvenir shops....indeed it was an enjoyable one whole day stay in this part of the island-state"
,,"Just amazing, despite the tacky shows",5.0,,"If there's a more diverse bird park elsewhere in the world, it must be stunning to top Jurong. Yes, there are issues with birds in cages, and if that hurts, don't go. Or you could argue that a park like this can raise awareness of the natural wonders of our world and the need to preserve habitat and diversity. Even the tacky bird shows carry an environmental message. But keep your wallet in your pocket and only go to the free shows. Spend hours wandering the lush park, staring goggle-eyed at bird species you never knew existed. It's a big ask for kids, but they'll love the birds, and the big water playground near the entrance/exit. Take water."
,,Interesting place to visit with your children,4.0,,"Great place to visit with your family especially children. The place is quite clean with many species of birds to see and birds shows to check. But if the rains come, then many birds shows have to be cancelled. My children is dissapointed when we ran to catch up 1 birds show but it cancelled. The toilet is not much and not very clean, but still okay. The bus sign for us to go back to MRT station is not very clear, but with the crowds walk along we can follow the, easily."
,,Best Attraction of Singapore,5.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park according to me is the best tourist attraction of Singapore. It is huge, clean & very well maintained. Its lush greenery combined with exotic birds of all types is somthing out of this world and infact one is transformed to a different world where one gets lost in the the beauty of nature. It is a place which will thrill people of all ages. The trolley ride is well designed, having intermediate stations, where one can get down and explore the park. This service is a great boon especially for elders for whom walking great distances is a problem. The only small drawback we felt was the bird show "" Kites"" which we felt was produced quite amateurishly. However, all said & done, a must visit place before you die."
,,"Great concept, a little bit boring.",3.0,,"I came here with a friend in the afternoon, so we only have around 2 hours to tour this bird park.
Our first impression was amazed. First of all, we find that the area just after the ticket/gate was full of birds, without any cage or whatever surround the area. So the birds can fly around freely without any barrier at all. There's also pinguin's area on the right just after we enter the bird park. But after 30 minutes we got bird. First of all, this complex is huge with combination of uphill and downhill, I recommend you buy ticket that is also include the free shuttle bus to move around between area in this bird park. We also find that many birds are actually still live inside cage and with barriers around the area. It still worth a visit though if you happened to be in Singapore. What amaze me is a country like Singapore can make something like this while countries with better natural resources like Malaysa and Indonesia can't."
,,The best wildlife park in Singapore,5.0,,"My first time going to Jurong Bird Park was in last June with my eldest son who loves animals. My son didn't want to go at first because our impressions of bird parks are usually quick dirty. To our surprise, the Jurong Bird Park was very clean and well maintained. The park itself is very big and contain of different sections. Taking the tram is a better choice if you have very young children.

My son and I both love the penguins exhibit, the bird feeding area, the discovery/education/nursery centre, the Pelican bay and the shows.

This time I have bring along all 4 of my boys (ages 11, 8, 5 and 2 1/2) and two other families and we all had a great time there. With kids, you can easily spend one whole day there as there are a lot to see and they even have a water play area for children. make sure you bring along a change of clothes.

After hopping through the different zoos and parks in Singapore, I really think that this is the best wildlife park in Singapore. We even like the shops there."
,,A MUST for all ages!,5.0,,I thought this would have been just another 'zoo' experience but its much more than that! Would actually visit again and could quite easily pass the whole day there! The park itself is beautiful ... lots of areas if lush greenery and there are many areas to simply sit and enjoy the scenery. Although some of the birds are caged there are many areas where you can wander amongst them in their natural environment. The Lory Loft is a great experience .... such pretty and colourful birds and it is lovely to feed them. Good public transport links. Facilities excellent. Good refreshments.
,,Great to get in touch with wonderful birds and nature,4.0,,"A wonderful Tropical surrounding. To get an overview by a round-trip within the park, you may take the road-tram inside. There is also a monorail, but this was already closed when we visited the part at 3 p.m.

Great is the option to feed hundreds of birds by your own at the Lory Loft - especially for Kids this is an unique experience.

On the negative side is that you can't access the partk with public transport: you have to take a taxi which is more expensive and you may have to wait to catch one."
,,How to spend a day in Singapore?,4.0,,"It was a beautiful Saturday morning when I decided to head down to the Jurong Bird Park for a visit and to catch the birds in action. As it is situated in the Western part of Singapore, it is best to check out the routes and means of getting there. Driving there will be the easiest and there are ample parking spaces with affordable charges. Alternatively, take the MRT (East West Line) to Boon Lay station and from there a shuttle bus directly to the Bird Park. The rates for an adult is SGD$20 while for a child (3-12 years) is SGD$13.
The park opens at 8.30 in the morning and closes at 6 in the evening and the best time to photograph the birds will be in the early morning or late afternoon hours when it is nice and cool. Unfortunately, on the day of my visit, the ""Kings of the Skies"" show was cancelled due to some technical reasons but we still managed to catch the others at Lory Loft, African Waterfall Aviary, Penguin Coast, Peilcan Cove and the other open areas. I left with lots of good memories and lots of photos to remember the occasion. A good time to spend your holidays or weekends with your family members."
,,A very mixed review with some world class highlight,4.0,,"1. The aviaries, larger cages with smaller birds and outdoor wetlands are truly superb with an accessible and close experience with an amazing collection of birds. Take a camera!
2. Many walkways and some attractions are closed 'whilst we upgrade'. This was seen far too frequently on our walk round
3. Some of the larger birds (e.g. birds of prey and penguins) look unhappy in their relatively cramped accommodation
4. Getting to the JBP on public transport is long and involves an interchange to a bus service where we waited 40 minutes with no seats in a queue. The return journey was lucky as we walked up as the bus arrived.

Overall, a very enjoyable attraction but allow some time for access (45 minutes MRT, 15 minutes bus ride, perhaps 45 minute interchanges all multiplied by two for the return)"
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"I am not a bird lover. Took my daughter for a trip . But truly enjoyed the day.
The bird show was breathtaking and informative. Please look for the schedule online before you go.
Best to buy a tram ride. Infact ere is a combo available for the zoo and the park"
,,"good price, great experience.......... a must visit",5.0,,"i have visited Singapore twice and both times i went to Jurong bird park........ its a treat to see so many birds at one place and so many shows going on that u will never wanna leave. one thing can surely be said about this park ""name it and you will find the bird, they have owls, penguins, parrots and many many more. it is advisable that if you are visiting Singapore you should take the three in one pass that lets you explore three fantastic wildlife getaways of Singapore at a comparatively cheaper price the places being Jurong bird park, Singapore zoo, Singapore night safari........ its a must visit we spent the whole day there and did not get bored for even a second"
,,A wide variety of birds!,5.0,,Go on the guided tour. You'll see the park differently. I feel awed by the settings. The birds must feel very much at home
,,Fun Feeding Times with Feathered Friends,5.0,,"To have the most fun out of your trip, do participate in the Feeding Sessions and Behind the Scenes Tour if possible. The Lory Loft feeding takes place the whole day - the lories are so friendly and some will perch on your hands, arms or head! Simply purchase a $3 cup of good stuff (honey barley) and the birds will come towards you. Be careful though as these cheeky birds nearly nipped out the pen from my father-in-law's pocket! Next stop to the Waterfall Aviary, where there is a mealworm feeding time for the starlings and bee-eaters. Do note that at 10.30am, visitors can no longer purchase food to feed, but only at 2.30pm - do ask for the crickets, it's fun to feed them with the crickets and see how the birds catch their food in mid-air. We were fortunate to catch the free tour of the Breeding & Research Centre during the march school holidays. If you miss this, don't worry, you can go for the Behind the Scenes tour and they will show you how they breed critically endangered birds and act as nannies to little hatchlings (feeding them with a syringe). The Flamingo feeding at 1.30pm is also a real treat and fresh experience. I never knew they eat bread! The shows were also very fun to watch and experience as the birds fly low so near to our heads. In all, a very interactive and fun experience for the whole family! Tips 1. NTUC Union card members get 30% discount off ticket prices. 2. Eating places a bit limited, we prefered Hawk Cafe selling local delights vs Bongo Burgers, which is slightly overpriced. 3. The park is rather big for walking. Do take the tram (separate tickets) but if not, do wear very comfy walking shoes, wear a hat and put on your sunblock and mosquito repellent! 4. Do plan your trip according to the feeding and show times. Have fun!"
,,"Impressive variety, amazing photo opportunity",5.0,,"I took the bus there, and interestingly enough the bus stop is the same when you leave (so don't mistakenly cross the road). Food is expensive, and some of the restaurants are right up at the entrance area, so you should plan your route accordingly.

The combination of an impressive number of bird species and trying to capture good photos made my stay at the bird park much longer than I initially planned.

From owls to eagles, hornbills and pelicans, lorries and kingfishers, emus and swans -- all have their own beauty, and the setup of the park let you inside some enclosures. Penguin exhibit was probably the least impressive for me, since the glass was dirty and difficult to see through (except for the South African penguins that are in a separate outside area).

I enjoyed the owl exhibit and eagle area for their variety and proximity (generally close enough that you could actually see their faces and eyes, rather than a partial body at a corner of the enclosure). The info signs were pretty informative and well placed for the most part (I hate when i try to find the name of the bird and there's no sign, or even worse an empty signboard).

Towards closing time, I was lucky enough to catch a practice session (open to everyone) for a new show they were going to launch at the end of 2012/early 2013? It was a very unique experience, seeing the handlers and birds practicing together - mistakes, missed cues or incorrect replies and all. It really makes you appreciate the training and effort involved and intelligence of the birds (perhaps even more than a perfectly performed show).

If you are open to birds in general, it is a definite must go. I left appreciating and learning more about birds i had never even heard of or seen before. It's a great place to take photos as well, since you can get up close to the birds, and so many different and rare species to photograph!"
,,Jurong bird park,5.0,,We had a great time at the bird park. Young and old alike will find this an enjoyable experience. There are bird shows and bird feeding opportunities. The park is lushly landscaped. I recommend it highly.
,,Great place for kids,4.0,,Its always great to bring kids outdoors and I really enjoyed it when I was there. Learning on all the different types of birds. Worth a visit if its your first time in Singapore.
,,Perfect for bird lovers,3.0,,We attended a birthday party which was quite entertaininf for the kids as they got to watch the bird show which was very entertaining. The tram ride is also an easy way of seeing the whole park quickly if they kids get bored and want to go straight to the water park. Take note it does get very smelly in some parts of the park. The kids loved the water park and were entertained by it for a long time.
,,Losing its brilliance,4.0,,"I remember coming to Jurong about 8 years ago and i was in awe of the place, as it was so well made.
But on my second trip, i felt it has just lost its shine.
The big drawback is that they no longer operate the monorail inside, which was a fantastic way to view the entire place and had great views of the birds.
It has instead a tram ride which will pick or drop you off at 3 stations.
The display of birds itself was quite nice and the highlight of our evening was the high flyers show which showcases the carnivores in all their glory, with vultures, hawks and owls flying right above your head and in front of you.
The walk through aviary is also quite nice and has a man made waterfall also inside.
What they need is a bit of uplifting of the entire place and also another food outlet inside, but still not a bad way to spend few hours in Singapore."
,,Incomplete trip without visiting Jurong,5.0,,"One of the most fascinating park I have visited.

To get to the park by MTR you may get off at Boon Lay station and then you need to take Bus No. 194 or 251 from Boon Lay Bus Interchange.

For the park ticket it costs around $20 per adult however there is something called as Park hoppers which gives you discount on purchase of ticket of 2 or max 3 parks(Singapore Zoo, Jurong Bird Park and Night Safari). I’m sure at least you would do 2park so why not save some dollars, isn’t it?

This park is one of the popular bird sanctuary and Asia’s largest bird park. It has most amazing birds you would love to see and feed. The best part about this park is it gives you the opportunity to feed the beautiful multi-colour birds. You may walk across the bridges with a cup of nectar provided by the park and you will be amazed to see the birds around you, your shoulder, head. Its so much fun.
There are quite a few shows like Kings of the Skies, High Flyers Show don’t miss them. They too good.

It’s a good walk inside the park so wear your comfortable flip flop or footwear. Loads of souvenir shops inside the park, grab some!"
,,High Flyers Show was fantastic!,5.0,,"The High Flyers Show was one of my favorite parts of my day at the Bird Park. I was unable to attend the other shows but heard from other patrons they are equally fantastic.

Don't miss the Lory Feeding either. The birds are colorful and thrilled to eat right out of your hand.

For a nature lover like myself this was a high point of my trip to Singapore!"
,,Great day for young and old,5.0,,"Great day, allow 3/4 hours to walk round. In usual Singapore style, very well laid out, walked all around the park and did not miiss any of the fabulous birds. All looked very well cared for. Park spotless. Wish I was 4 again to enjoy fantastic new water park, could only watch from a distance! Well worth a visit."
,,Well kept park but lacking the wow factor,3.0,,"The park itself is well maintained and the birds are clearly looked after and appear to be happy.
However a lot of the exhibitions felt a bit repetitive and could do with some renovation. Overall it was a good day out but not a patch on Singapore Zoo which was amazing!"
,,Fun place for all ages,5.0,,"We visited the Jurong Bird Park on our most recent trip to Singapore and loved it, even before you enter you walk through a beautiful garden then past talkative parrots perched in a tree, heading around the park you can see Penguins and Puffins, feed the Lorrikeets, watch the two shows (highly recommended), and see a very wide selection of different birds all in large enclosures.
Get there early and you could easily spend 4-5 hours here, I highly recommend this for Bird Lovers of all ages."
,,A must place to VISIT!^^,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is one of the best places of interest in Singapore.
For those who love nature, never miss this amazing place.
It simply makes you indulge with the nature and do remember to plan you itinerary well.
Don't MISS any shows as those shows are the ""LANDMARK"" of Jurong Bird Park.

Well spent a day for exploring.."
,,A must-see place for visitors.,5.0,,"Don't care about it having the largest man-made waterfall in the world, but it's an excellent place to have a day out with family. Kids will love it. Wait for the shows. Superbly entertaining!"
,,One of the biggest attractions in singapore!,5.0,,Been here twice and have spent atleast 5-6 hours. yes.. that's how huge this place is! and with 3-4 shows thrown in...does take lot of time to ensure you have covered it all! The bird show is held at the huge amphitheater and is very well produced. The talking birds are a hoot! The monorail is very helpful is giving a bird's eye view of the park. Convenient as a hop-on hop-off too. The staff is helpful and friendly. They do their best to ensure that you have an enjoyable visit.
,,Amazing experience!,5.0,,"There was such a large range of different, beautiful birds here - from cranes to birds of prey to the beautiful macaws. I went alone in a taxi and had a great time. I spent the whole day exploring. You can walk through the tree tops and feed lorikeets, watch the birds of prey and even see the eggs in the incubator. An overall wonderful day."
,,Nice place.....go!,4.0,,"I enjoyed this bird park. I mainly like to take pictures and I got some very nice ones.
At the entry of the park are some huge blue macaws and you get get close and they don't move much so great pics there. Then inside there are multiple other places for good pictures.
I got some great ones with parrots with orchids.

There is also an entertaining bird show, check the times when you get there and don't miss it.
Its not good for picture taking as theres lots of movement though. So just sit and enjoy. Don't be afraid to sit higher up as many of the birds fly from stage up there and back. So if your down low your craning your neck to see whats going on up behind you.

If your up higher when they ask for volunteers, do it if you like, as the bird will come to the volunteer he picks. Chances are he is looking for the person sitting at the right place so he knows where he wants to pick from. You might hold a hoop and a huge bird will fly through, or
a bird will take something from you and bring it to the stage, and then take it back....don't be shy.

There is a large walk in aviary FULL of colorful birds too. Great pics can be had there. You can buy a little cup of gruel that they eat and they will flock to those with cups. You don't have to have a cup as birds will be near you as they flock to others, or many come near and sit on the fence and you can see and photograph them there."
,,Great attraction,4.0,,"I've been to Singapore a number of times, but never been here before. I went on a Saturday and it wasn't very busy there. I could move around freely and saw a few of the shows that the park has to offer.

So many attractions and different types of birds to see. You can even experience feeding of the lorikeets first hand if you like for a small fee, but it is great fun.

You can walk through the tree tops and feed lorikeets, sit and watch the birds of prey, wander through the bird nursery section and see eggs incubating and baby birds being cared for or just wander through the grounds and look at all the beautiful birds there. Restaurants and food kiosks are also good."
,,If you like birds you'll love this place,5.0,,"A large range of different birds are kept here - from cranes to birds of prey to the beautiful macaws. You can walk through the tree tops and feed lorikeets, sit and watch the birds of prey, wander through the bird nursery section and see eggs incubating and baby birds being cared for or just wander through the grounds and look at all the beautiful birds there. Restaurants and food kiosks are also good. Definitely worth it for the bird lover."
,,Great attraction for all,5.0,,"Visiting with my family and older friends, all enjoyed this attraction. It is very well maintained and has many exhibits to keep everyone amused. You can even experience feeding of the lorikeets first hand if you like for a small fee. Be prepared however, for birds to do their droppings on you, as this is nature.

Kid's water play area is great, but did not know about this, so was unprepared but will know for next time."
,,One of the Best Parks ever visited,5.0,,"For all travellers to Singapore, please do not miss visiting this place. Whether you are with kids or alone or with friends, this place is for sure to amze us all.

The serene beauty of birds all along, the beautiful colorful parrots and other birds, mesmerising penguins, the shows & the well trained ever smiling staff is all so very beautiful and such quality stuff, something to difficult to find it elsewhere.

Plan yourselves accrodingly, though people say its good to have a breakfast at the park with the birds, but its not worth the hooplah. You can reach in by 9 or 9.30 am and manage to complete the shows plus the entire park visit by 12.30 pm

Do not miss the morning 10.30/11 am show, its the best show ever seen till date.

You can plan your day starting with Jurong Bird Park in the morning, around noon 1/1.30 pm reach the Zoo and then around 6.30 max reach for the night safari. Just a word of advice, there is a lot of walking to do all throughout the day, possibly hire a pram or so for babies/young kids."
,,Lovely Attraction,4.0,,"A beautiful and lovely attraction, good species of birds, but plan an entire day for this attraction. Also, avoid visiting here during the rains, the birds will go hiding.."
,,A unique experience.,5.0,,"At present the panorail is out of commission, but a wagon train (tractor drawn carriages) is available every twenty minutes. For me the best part is the largest walk in aviary in the world, holding over a thousand bird of many different species. It also has the worlds tallest man made waterfall. As long as there isn't a school visit there is plenty to see and photograph,(try to get in as near to 08.30 as possible, cooler and less chance of school visits). What is not widely known or advertised, is that large Iguanas and Monitor Lizards are free to roam the park. Again being quiet and stealthy brings dividends, we saw both species around four foot in length. Some of the flying programmes staged around the park are worth seeing, especially for children. Very informative, there is a snackbar, and drink dispensers, also toilets are before you enter. A handy thing to know if you are accompanied by children, there are also toilet facilities at the Waterfall and Aviary station."
,,"""awesome""",4.0,,"We had a wonderful experience in the Jurong bird park, I like the bird park, it was exciting because we arrived early, our tour guide told us to be seated on the mark spot during the bird show, birds flew right in front of us and that was so nice, a close encounter with the beautiful creature, we also enjoyed feeding the birds and with the tour around the park. We enjoyed also watching the penguins. I want to visit again someday."
,,Everyone should enjoy it,4.0,,"A Bird Park with some unusual features. The Lorikeets is the most fantastic feature. You are inside the big enclosute and the birds screech and squable to persuade you to feed them. whilst alighting nearby or actually on your person. They sit on your shoulder and will walk down your arm to the food.. Ths big penguin display has over 70 birds and there are pelicans, flamingoes and many others. There is a free Birds of Prey Show too. At extra cost you can ride round on a tram but there were not enough stops and no great views and we found it better to walk. You don't need children to enjoy it"
,,great way to spend the day...,4.0,,"i had never been to a bird park before...probably, because it was the first time, i enjoyed it more..
penguins at the start of the park was awesome... :-)
and lori feeding was also pretty nice...
its a long walk..else, opt for the tram ride inside the park...
the shows and feeding the birds are pretty nice..."
,,The best birds park in Asia,5.0,,"I was twice there and I will go again next time I'm in Singapore. Very well maintained park with plenty of beautiful spots, interesting shows and many opportunities to feed the birds, touch them and watch them. Birds are just amazing.

To get there on public transport take MRT green line, station EW27 (Boon Lay). Through shopping mall you get to bus terminal, buses 194 or 251 - last stop. It's a 15 minutes drive."
,,Fantastic Day Out,5.0,,"Visited Jurong Bird Park with friends and had a thoroughly enjoyable day out despite heavy rain for a large part of our visit. The park is very well laid out and the birds are mostly in large enclosures and easy to see. Sadly many were sheltering due to the heavy rain which started during our visit. We bought rain ponchos and continued with our visit despite the persistent heavy rain.

This park is suitable for most people as the walking is gentle and there is a tram option as well. Walking is the best option to see all the birds though. There are plenty of spots to shelter, use the washrooms or purchase drinks throughout the park.

I will definitely visit again - the Penguins are particularly entertaining especially watching them swimming through the glass sided tanks."
,,The friendliest Lorikeets,4.0,,"We visited Jurong Bird Park over Chinese New Year and had a good time. The enclosures/cages seem of a good size and the feeding of the Lorikeets is a must! They sit on your shoulder and screech util they walk down your arm to the food. It was an experience! Saw the Birds of prey show which was great, however tram ride is no where near as good as the night safari."
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Excellent place amidst nature, I have not seen such a variety of birds at one place. They have a few shows as well. Please as much as information possible before going there.

If you go from Orchard, they have a bus that picks you up at 9:12 am from the busstop opp. to Mandarin Gallery and reaches Park around 10 a.m. While coming back you may take the same bus , otherwise you may take a bus # 194 to Boon Ley station and take a MRT train to Raffles and change there for a train towards Orchard."
,,Interesting and Informative,4.0,,"The Jurong bird park is a must visit if you enjoy nature and birds or you have kids. The variety of birds is unbelievable. The colours and sounds of the birds are beautiful. The breeding centre in the park is very educational. It wonderful to see birds in their natural habitat. Be prepared to spend about 3-4 hours if you want to see the entire park and make sure to wear comfortable clothing & shoes, as it gets quite humid and there's a lot of walking to do. Carrying a bottle of water would be a wise thing to do. A wonderful experience!"
,,Deja Vu!,3.0,,"Nothing has changed since our last visit in 2003. Same set-up, same birds even the bird shows haven't changed much. But the bird park was beautifully decorated with flowers to welcome the Chinese New Year. The only thing I didn't see was the monorail. Instead, there was a tram going around to bring visitors from one station to another. There also were not enough eating places and the only restaurant serving rice was at the entrance and even the choices were too limited. The zoo had better eating places."
,,Amazing collection of plumed wonders,5.0,,"I visited the Jurong Bird park as a kid with my parents years ago, and now i have a child of my own, will definitely bring him there. I had so much fun even last year when I went for photography.. It still amazes me. The wonderful sounds and colors. The wide variety of collection. It is best to go in the morning, when it is not so hot and crowded. It is a must see for kids."
,,Great for bird lovers,5.0,,"A visit to Jurong Bird Park has been on my wish list for many years and I was not disappointed. I am an enthusiastic bird keeper and bird watcher, so the only way I would not enjoy this place is if the birds were miserable. That was definitely not the case. Most of the birds were in very spacious enclosures and had enrichment such as fresh browse, swings and foraging opportunities. On both of our visits (we went twice in our ten day Singapore visit) the birds were happy and comfortable.
We saw the High Flyers and Kings of the Skies shows and both were quite good. I am not a huge fan of shows usually, as they are too often just a ""bag of tricks"" which seem a bit demeaning to the animals. However, these shows had much more focus on showing the birds' beauty and natural behaviour with strong conservation messages. The birds seemed quite willing to participate and were well rewarded.
My favourite part was the Lory Loft. We spent hours here, buying Lory mix to feed and enjoying attracting some of the more unusual inhabitants. Most people are content with the rainbow lorikeets that mob you around the entrance, but if you'd like to see some of the rarer inhabitants, move down the bridges away from the crowds and be patient. My other tips would be not to wear clothes with huge eyes on it (I saw an Angry Birds t-shirt and an elmo hat) as this will spook the birds, and remember to move calmly and quietly as charging at the birds will scatter them.
Jurong Bird Park is clean, well-maintained and a pleasure to visit. The walk-in exhibits are a great experience and there is plenty of shade for walking around the park. The tram is worthwhile to rest the feet but I found the commentary a little annoying and slightly out of date compared to recent park upgrades. Children may get a bit tired with the hills but there are scooters you can hire if it gets too much for everyone."
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"I went twice to this great place, I admit I am a bird watcher so love birds but this was just great. I felt the heat dreadfully in Singapore so I had to find areas to cool down a lot & I found little hideouts to sit that had fans & a few airconditioned areas before I would venture out again. The shows were fun & the talks interesting. I came home with over 300 photos which I am sure when I go through them will cut down but with so many beautiful & different birds I could not stop snapping. The staff were friendly & answered my questions well & all spoke excellent English which makes it easy for the English speakers, not sure how the other many visitors of many nationalities cope. Overall a great place to visit."
,,NATURE'S PARADISE,5.0,,"Creature of nature are in abuandance. It's a paradise of nature. When needs peace at heart, it's a place where lots to be learnt from the birds."
,,Good for all!,4.0,,I'm not a zoo person so I wan't sure about going to this park but we had a great time. Very beautiful. The largest man made waterfall is really spectacular. The birds are really well taken care of. We didn't notice any smell at all. Maybe because we were there during rainy season. Thankfully it didn't rain the day we went. Take the tram then get out and walk the park.
,,Too crowded On weekends!,3.0,,"It is a nice small park that is very well maintained. It also has a water playground for kids. However, can give this park a miss if you have been to the zoo, or don't have time to cover many places when you are on holiday. Do avoid weekends. It is really too crowded to enjoy with a family of young children. Too many group tours rushing for time and pushing around to see the feeding sessiOns."
,,Wonderful bird park,4.0,,We were very impressed by this wonderful bird park and enjoyed the shows. It's definitely worth a visit (but not when it's pouring with rain!)
,,It stinks,3.0,,"I was not really impressed with this place because it stunk all the time due to the massive amount of bird droppings. It seems hygiene is not really a priority here and the logistics of having a bird park seems to be thought over. I am sure there should be a way to do it without having it stink so much, like in bird sanctuaries, for example."
,,Great spot for some bird watching.,4.0,,Lovely setting with a huge variety of birds as well as shows to select from. Would be good if some of the birds were in roomier cages but otherwise very good. Did not find many places where you could stop for a picnic lunch within the park but lots of places to buy food.
,,Amazing bird park,5.0,,This is an amazing bird park. The shows were entertaining as well. We all enjoyed going. We spent about half a day there which was more than adequate for us. It is worth having a look at in my view.
,,Good but needs a revamp,3.0,,"The Bird Park remains a good option to visit with kids. It has attractions like the waterfall and the Lori Loft that kids would enjoy. They have also added a water play area for kids. The staff is friendly and helpful and it is a short distance from the Boon Lay MRT station.

However it is not very interactive except for the bird shows and the Lori Loft and so younger kids especially start getting bored after a while. So even though we have bought a membership for a year, I don't think we would be visiting this even half as often as we would visit the zoo or the beaches here.

This time I visited it after a gap of about 2yrs and I couldn't help feeling that the place looked a little lacklustre than normal. The monorail service was closed as it is undergoing repairs. And the restaurant options are extremely limited. Bongo Burgers is unnecessarily expensive and the quality of food they serve for that price is way below par. Would recommend taking a picnic lunch along and skipping that place.

On the whole, it is a good place to visit once as a tourist or with kids but not an attraction you would like to go back to again and again."
,,Swanning about,5.0,,"It's easy to spend all day at Jurong Bird Park, there's so much to see and it's a lovely place to just wander around and enjoy the peace and quiet.
The variety of birds is amazing and you may well see some you've never come across before!
The penguins were my favourite, I could have watched them all day!
It's a bit far from the city but easy to get to on the train and bus."
,,In Nature's Lap,4.0,,"Lovely experience to be around so many birds - vast species. Be prepared to walk though within the park. Good landmarks and sign boards within the park and the bird show is fun to watch, even for adults. It was therapeutic from the fast corporate life."
,,A Bird in the hand....,3.0,,"This is a place for families not serious bird people. If you want serious birds then go to the bird park at Iguassu Falls in Brazil. Most of this park is in good order with some parts only under repair. The refreshment areas are not good unless you really like tasteless food. The Lori Loft is fantastic for the ability to get really close to the birds.

I think that the conservation aspect could be stressed more. All in all we quite enjoyed the day but I am not sure if the owners think that they are bird people or entertainment providers."
,,the best bird park that I saw,5.0,,"someone rightly suggested that you need to like birds otherwise you will get bored however non bird lovers also will enjoy the place & perhaps will get to see how the living beings are are managed so well. its spread scross huge area & one has different modes to travel - walk, battery rides, bus rides & tram( though I did not see one moving), offcourse their is a small premium to pay! One can pay & get clicked with Macau for S$ 25.... There are penguins, owls, poelicans, flamingoes, macaus, vultures, ostritch & other birds from across the globe. There are no animals & hence its righly called the BIRD PARK.There is a wayerfall as well & good place to take photos.

Anything in singapore is well connected & this too is on East West MRT line. One needs to alight at Boon Lay & take a bus or even Cab. The basic entry feel at entry level is S$20 for an adult & S$13 for a child. there is no fee for kids below 3 years.

TIP: if you are visiting with kids, There is a waterpark for smaller kids in the bird park & kids would love to jump."
,,Asia's largest bird paradise,5.0,,"There are over 5000 birds of more than 300 species roam freely. Many of them you can touch, feed in your own hands."
,,Great day out,4.0,,"First of all you need to like birds otherwise you will get bored. The park is in the very west of Singapore, only the Discovery Center and the Science museum are close by. There is a waterpark for smaller kids in the bird park which looked like great fun. So if you have small children bring their swimming costumes. The park itself is well laid out and the variety of birds is amazing. Go early in the morning when the birds are activ."
,,The Best Bird Park Anywhere,5.0,,"We had a great day at Jurong Bird Park, birds in kept cages may be a questionable practice but like it or not zoos and bird parks are the way that many species are preserved and their conservation promoted. In that respect Jurong is as good as it gets, the aviaries are by and large spacious, some are massive, covering many acres. The habitats are excellent and there is an emphasis on environmental enrichment and assuring natural behaviour is encouraged. That said some enclosures such as those in ""Parrot Paradise"" were disappointing especially given that this area houses highly intelligent animals. On the whole, If i were a captive bird I would consider myself lucky if I found myself at Jurong.
From a visitors perspective it is a great attraction and unlike the Zoo and Night Safari, the transport side of things has been sorted out. It is an easy and pleasant journey on the MRT with a (pretty much) dedicated bus to the park from Boon Lay. Jurong is very well organised, the routes to exhibits easy to follow and everything is accessible. For those with disabilities, kids and the just plain lazy there are mobility scooters and other aids available for hire. We did not attend any of the shows because we simply weren't that organised. The emphasis on education rather than just entertainment is laudable and makes for a very interesting visit. For those who have a fancy for photography Jurong is a dream, most of the backgrounds are natural or neutral, the use of intrusive fencing and mesh is minimised and the use of water is spectacular, it is a photographers paradise.
Not only is the Park teaming with birds but the landscaping and planting is exquisite and sometimes breathtaking, the great waterfall is awe-inspiring, the plantings of orchids gorgeous, the passion of the keepers infectious.
The staff are lovely even to the point where, when I had a text from home to update me on a family matter and inquired if there was accessible public Wifi on the Park, i was told that there was not but one of the staff offered (insisted) that I use one of their mobiles to call home internationally, I was very grateful and can't praise them all highly enough. The beauty of the Park lies in the size of its aviaries and their accessibility, to be able to roam freely among the birds is a pleasure and privilege.
On our visits to Singapore we consider that Jurong is a MUST."
,,"Not as exciting as the zoo, but much fewer people",4.0,,"If you like zoos and especially if you like birds, this place is worthwhile. It's old, but there are few people there outside of the crowded shows. The best place for kids there is the lory loft. They can roam across bridges with the lories."
,,Perfect place to visit with kids in Singapore,4.0,,"We visited Singapore with our kids of age 2 and 6 respectively in Dec. Personally, I found Jurong bird park as the best attraction there with lovely shows. There was the not to be missed High Fliers show, which had over 100 birds of scintillating colors come up at the same time in the amphitheater. The kids were spell bound with the lovely birds showing off their skills. I was lucky to be called as a volunteer for the birds of prey show wherein a huge vulture flew and perched on my arm- must say was scared initially but it was thrilling. The whole place is very well organised and equipped with all the stuff one would need with small kids- taking the pram with us was really useful as one does have to walk around. Also, one can easily park the pram and enjoy the shows which start exactly on time. Overall while we spent about 3 hours one should plan for an entire day outing there as there is so much to enjoy. Go there in the morning hours as it becomes a little hot in the afternoon. Take caps along to avoid the sun. One can buy umbrellas if required for about 6-10 dollars but didnt really need to use one as there are so many covered areas to stand in if it rains."
,,"Must go, well worth it",4.0,,"Really enjoyed this day out, went with wife and kids aged 6 and kids 8. Nneed to allow 5 hours to get around the park inclusive of 2 shows that we visited both of which were excellent and fun for adults and kids. Take swim wear since park also has a mini waterpark which all the kids love. Took a taxi to get there from the Carlton hotel in the centre of Singapore,which this was great adviced a previous review that i had read, taxi fare not too expensive either. In the park bough ticket s for the tram ride but could really have given this a miss since park is walkable . Also suggest get to the park at opening time which was i think 10am. Great bird park, great day out, just go."
,,fun for whole family,4.0,,"We went to jurong bird park at 10 am , you caneasily spend a day at park. There are tram rides which will take you around the park, go for tram rides after 12 pm to avoid long queues in morning.its a photographers paradise , unfortunTely my photography skills are nextto worst so uploading best i have. Kids will love it , the shows are very interesting . Park is easily accessible by MRT and buses , google maps will provide you train and bus details from your location, no need of a cab.overall a good park i doubt you will get to see something like this again so dont miss it. Also make sure you have proper clothing as singapore is really hot , we went in dec but still heat was unbearable , make sure you do not wear a pair of jeans !!"
,,So much fun,4.0,,"This is an amazing experience if you love birds. Birds of every kind can be found. The best were the Lories. For 3 dollars you can buy a cup full of nectar and end up with an arm, shoulder, head etc. covered in Lories. So much fun. The park needs a little updating - not as well put together as the newer zoos in Singapore, but still loads to see and Lorikeets to feed!"
,,Our friends in Sky,5.0,,"Sigapore's Jurong bird park is Asia's biggest bird paradise, where you can see many species of birds, touch some of them, play with them, feed some in your own hand. Many of them trained to entertain you also.When you buy tickets for the park, you can buy a compound tickets for other attractions like, Singapore flyer, Universal studeos, Sentosa etc, which are issued at discounted rates"
,,Angry Bird,3.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is 30 years old, and it shows. More should be done to improve the park. The park staff are excellent though. And the shows are still great. One thing to avoid though at all costs is Bongo Burgers Restaurant. Honestly, the park should just focus on running the park and leave catering to the professionals. Had the over-priced Fish n Chips, the fish tasted rancid. Even the kids' pasta was sub-standard. Next time, bring along your own sandwiches!"
,,"Jurong Bird Park, Singapore",5.0,,"If you like birds of all types, this is the place for you. The price per adult was around $22.00 USD. My favorite area was the Lory Loft where you could feed the Lorikeets. They land on your shoulders, hands, and arms, trying to get at the cup of food you're holding. It was great fun. Even my husband had a good time. We didn't attend any of the bird shows because of time constraints, but we did view some birds in huge aviaries and some in large individual cages. There were birds of prey, penguins, shore birds, songbirds, parrots and macaws, emus, toucans....there's just too many to name. You need at least an entire day to see and do everything. The food was a bit pricey, though.

I would suggest that you take some insect repellent with you. I ended up with a few mosquito bites by the time we left the park. You can rent strollers at the park, but I didn't notice if they had any stroller parking areas. There are some stairs to climb to the aviaries."
,,Interesting for kids & adults alike,4.0,,"Me and my husband went to Jurong Bird Park this christmas. Its an interesting place to visit when you have had enough of work/'clubbing/movies/busy city life and want to go relax somewhere close to nature. The prettiest birds to watch were flamingos, crowned pigeons and lorikeets and penguins. The shows were amazing as well with the best one being the newly introduced high flyers show. Indians and vegetarians can get chicken biryani and veg biryani set meals at one of the f&b outlets near main station 1. Small water park for children aged below 12 years is quite interesting but only for them. :) Souvenirs/plush toys are quite expensive though as compared to other places in singapore. There are benches/tables all around for having your own picnic food as well but no place to spread out picnic mat n all. Tram is available in Bird Park but I do not think its worth taking if you want to go around the whole park as there are only 3 stations but its ok if you want to visit selected attrations inside. There are scooters also available for one adult + one child @S$35 rental which are useful if you cant walk much or if you have a kid along. Lory feeding was very entertaining. Coffee is best at the australian cafe at Lory Loft. For getting there, go to Boon Lay interchange and take bus 194 or 251 and get down after 1 express stop. For coming back to Boon Lay interchange, cross the road from under the flyer and take bus 251 back. Its a full day attraction if you dnt want to run and cover the places, best time to reach is 9:30am to be in time for the first show at 10:00am."
,,Great fun feeding the birds,5.0,,"This is probably one of the largest bird parks I have ever visited.

A bit of trek to get there by public transport, you need to take the MRT and then a local bus. Think of it as part of fun.

The number of birds and activities are too many to mention, but bring your hiking boots and walk up to the spectacular waterfall.

The highlight is the opportunity to feed the birds in one of the aviaries. For just a few dollars you can have several parrots wanting to be your best friends for ever.

Great fun, highly recommended."
,,"Amazed by the birds, shows and staff.",5.0,,"A gem of a place away from the tourist hordes. Educational, entertaining, breath taking, relaxing and a great place to escape.

For the bird fundies out there look forward to; birds of paradise, shoebills, cotingas, palm cockatoos, hyacinth macaws and many other special species. The bird shows are well done and educational.

Put on your walking shoes as it is built on a hillside and is large. A tram will ensure those who do not wish to walk are driven to the different attractions.

Set aside a full day to enjoy all this wonderful place has to offer."
,,Amazing Bird Park,5.0,,"One should not miss the bird shows. its really amazing to see. The penguin feed is another awesome sight. The birds including owls &eagles are so well trained that it cannot be expressed in words. While visiting singapore, one must not miss out the Jurong Bird Park."
,,Fantastic! A must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Wow! Jurong Bird Park is simply fantastic! We were recommended to visit and went with out doing any research or expecting the scale of the park. We went with our two young kids and stayed the whole day, literally until the park closed for the day and we were told to leave. :)

This park must be largest of its kind. Thousands and thousands of birds. Some of which we have never heard off. The varieties and colors of Parrots were just out of the world. The Lorry (Parrot) feeding point was simply great. The Pink Flamingos, Eagles and each and every exhibit was simply great.

Highly Recommended. Will visit again!"
,,sleep with the penguins,4.0,,"call up the bird park to enquire about the 'sleepover-with-the-penguins' program. it is open to the public and held during the school holidays. for a 2D1N event with a fee, you get to visit the avian hospital, feed the pelicans, loris and flamingo. best of all, you get to pitch a tent inside the viewing gallery in the penguins enclosure and watch them while you lie in your sleeping bag. the bird park will provide a guide, who will explain the different birds that you see in the bird park in great detail. very informative and highly enjoyable. recommended for children ages 6-12."
,,Brilliant Day Out,5.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park was a great surpirise. I knew the Singapore Zoo was great but hadn't imagined that the bird park would be just as good. We went with our two teenage sons and stayed for hours. The variety of birds is amazing, our favourites were the owls and the parrots. Ironic, since we are Australans but this is the best parrot display we've seen. My husband and I went again on our next trip without the kids and enjoyed it just as much. I would definitely recommend it for everyone, but especially families."
,,A Very Good Bird Park,4.0,,Visited many years ago since I was a boy and last year with my kids. And I wouldn't mind coming again with friends from overseas. Tons of birds species to observe and a great walk for half a day or you can take the monorail to get around the park in about 20mins with 2-3 three stops. Don't forget your camera and check ahead on show times.
,,Excellent place to visit,4.0,,"My husband and I visited Jurong Bird Park when we were staying with friends in Singapore and we really enjoyed it. Lots to see and do and also a variety of shows (falconry, penguin feeding/information, birds and buddies) to see which were great and all included in the entrance price.

The waterfall inside the aviary is very impressive and a great place for taking photos and the Lory Loft is also great, where you get a chance to feed the birds and they'll land on your hand/arm. The birds are small and very colourful.

There is a kids play park where the kids can splash around in various water based toys and there are the usual variety of souvenir shops and eating places that are found in parks of this nature.

Well worth a visit. We only spent a few hours there but could have spent longer."
,,Nice !!,3.0,,Nice place for a visit with the children and family. It needs an overhaul and revamp. It feels a little old and worn out.
,,Very complete,5.0,,Lots of different venues and types of birds. The enclosure with the waterfall is impressive. The lorikeet feeding area is not to be missed.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,Nice to watch so many birds. it was well kept bird park. The shows were excellent to watch. The kids love to watch the show very much. We also loved the bird show.
,,Amazingly well kept bird park with interactive activities,5.0,,"I like birds and I was thrilled to learn there is a National Bird Park in Singapore. That said, as we were getting there, from past experiences with zoos and animal parks, I lowered my expectations and was expecting a sadly run park with sickly birds fenced up in cages hidden away in the distance and all you can do is watch them from a distance.

Well, how wrong I was! and how it exceeded my expectations!! It was a very clean and well-kept park where its inhabitants looked quite fit and healthy to me. We caught a spectacular and humorous show at 11:30 which featured a lot of bird flying interactivity with the audience (like the bird that took the money from an audience member). I was sad to have missed the eagle and hawks show at 4p as we had to leave to catch a plane and I wanted to see the hawks in action.

How much time to allot? We spent about 4 hours here and still didn't see everything! If you want to do it at a nice leisurely pace, come for 6 hours to catch the show schedule.

What to bring? A wide brim hat! Sunblock! sunglasses! The only thing that was uncomfortable was that I was being burned alive by the Singaporean mid day sun and was dehydrated by the humidity and heat! (Luckily, there are vending machines around the park but that sun is a skin peeler!) Sneakers (lots of walking, uphill, downhill, stairs, etc)

Best part? For me, it was the Lory Loft! I could have stayed there all day! For $3, you can get a cup of sweet nectar to feed the lorries and how cute and feisty these little birds are! They will land on your head, your shoulders, your arm, your hand and chirp and shriek at each other to get the dominant position on the cup so it can drink all the nectar! They are not shy!

I also enjoyed the owl's caves (they are AMAZING creatures, esp up close. So rare for me to see owls outside of a TV screen!), the penguins and puffins, the flamingos, the pelicans and the eagles, hawks and vultures! The great thing with this park is you can get pretty close to the birds in some areas. Which makes it that much more interesting because you just don't know what will happen!

If you like birds, you will enjoy this park."
,,Birds of A Feather,5.0,,"Unique, great place for family outings. Bring the kids or grandma. Especially love the Asian Bird Enclosure where you can buy worms to feed to birds that will flock to your fingers. Also, the lorikeet aviary is quite a trip but watch out for the squirts .... LOL!"
,,Well taken care Bird Park,4.0,,Singapore has one of the best zoos and animal park. Jurong bird park is one of them. Bring your children for new experiences and lessons. =)
,,I love parrots.,5.0,,"Park entrance you fascinated by parrots. Able to walk around in the park with shuttle (surcharge). And best of lori parrots feed (feed cost).

Getting the best for the shuttle. but also a good option.MRT and bus,

Free floating birds can be fitted to your feet."
,,lovely jurong bird park,5.0,,"another great family outing at jurong bird park singapore.
large variety of colourful birds, kept in top class facilities.
really well planned walk through.
plus a bus tour for those who prefer not walking in the sun.
you need about 3-4 hours to do justice to this park.
again, good snack facilities and clean wash rooms.
you can save a lot by buying a combi ticket which includes the zoo, night safari and the bird park. Alternatively, the zoo and the bird park can be combined. Both are quite some distance apart, so best to visit them on separate days."
,,A bird park one must visit,5.0,,"I would suggest you must all reach this park quite early, i.e. early in the morning - opening time. Since you have a large area to cover I would suggest you must adjust your timings with special bird-shows, one at 11:30 and next at 14:30. It is tiring but worth visiting."
,,An excellent day out with the family,4.0,,"The park is not really central - the easiest way to visit it is by taking a taxi.
The entrance fee is quite high - if you are visiting Singapore and consider doing some of the parks it would be worth buying the combined ticket (Singapore Zoo/ Singapore night safari and Jurong Bird Park)- it saves you around SGD 12.
What I liked most about the park is that there are quite a few aviaries that you can walk through - you can roam freely between the birds and have a close look.
The toukan and pelican section is very large, and I loved the ostriches and emus.
Another must do section is the penguin section, right next to the entrance.
The park is accessible with strollers and wheelchairs, but some of the slopes are quite steep."
,,A bit tired.,3.0,,I have visited this park a few times over the last 20 years but found it to be a little 'tired' this time. The monorail was not working (was fantastic for an all-over view) and many of the birds appeared to have no water on what was quite a hot day. (We mentioned this while departing).The food was ordinary and quite expensive. Not all was 'bad' however - the train ride was great and the variety of birds was impressive. Liked the penguin exhibit and the lorikeets were good value - cheeky little things.Good for those who are unable to access this type of facility in their own country but the long trip out from the city and the reasonabaly high entrance cost might put some off. If you have children in strollers be aware that there are some very steep places and you may need your muscles. Take hats!
,,Revisiting after 36 years,5.0,,"Having lived in Singapore as a child, I went there when it was still in its infancy, having been opened in 1971. Back then it was the largest bird cage in the world with the entire park contained in the huge bird avery. As with everything in Singapore that too has changed dramatically.

The area of land has grown immensely as has their bird population. I think they are now boasting over 6000 different birds and hundreds of different species.

As with back in the 1970's they have tried to keep the birds environments as close to their natural habitat as possible, hence the lack of fencing and containment. This lets them feel more comfortable and gives the visitor more access to them.

The main highlights for us would be the lorikeets (feeding them is a real experience as they launch themselves towards the nectar) and the birds of prey display. A real up-close encounter with some of the worlds most feared birds.

Well worth the visit while in Singapore. Our only disappointment would be that we went through the Tour East group and were only allocated about 3hrs there. You really need longer if you wish to see all the displays, shows as well as having a good look around."
,,Awesome for kids,4.0,,"We relaxed here for a few hours and make sure you make the effort. About a $30 cab ride from in town but you as well as the kids will have a blast. Make sure you bring your swimmers so the kids can hit the wet play area and the big bucket at the end of the day. We took plenty of food and water for snacks but there are plenty of spots you can get food/coffee as long as you have cash on you. Easy to walk around as it's only about a 1.5 km circuit or you can use the ""train"". Loved the flamingo's and toucans and the birds of prey. Plenty to see and do and feed and the kids will have a blast. You can hire strollers too."
,,Take your camera- a very unique experience.,5.0,,"I was thrilled with the time I spent here. Call me a dork, but feeding the lorikeets was tremendous fun. Some of them even landed on my head! What they do here is unique- great for all ages, and educational. It's really neat to see the birds not in cages. Some are in HUGE aviaries, some are just loose and ""hanging out"" and some are in smaller settings. The birds of prey show was great, and the ""falconer"" has lots of enthusiasm. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't enjoy it. Believe me, Go.
P.S.- the flamingos are the most amazing thing I have ever ever seen. Vibrant Coral."
,,"Still the same, but higher prices",3.0,,"Went there 7 years ago and again this time with my husband since he hadn't been there, but was quite disappointed to see that its all still the same with no real changes. The monorail which I quite enjoyed last time has also shut down and there's only a tram now. We had to wait an average of 15 mins at every stop for it, easting a lot of time. Skip it and just walk about! The birds of prey show and the bird life cycle are worth it.

Also, as we entered, a lady volunteer walked up to us and asked us if we wanted tickets for the entrance, ""unlimited lory feeding"" and the tram ride. We got excited thinking that there would be a lot of birds coming to feed like you see in pictures. However, the birds aren't interested in the feed you have, you'd be lucky if you get two eating out of your bowl. We ended up giving our bowls off to a child who had not bought feeding bowls (nice choice!)

The tram ride was short (although the volunteer told us it would take four hours to tour the park) and could have easily been done by us walking instead of waiting for it! So instead of paying 18 SGD we ended up paying 26! What a waste."
,,A good place to spend the day.,4.0,,This is a good place to enjoy a few hours watching birds and learning about different types of birds. There are some new and strange variety that I have not seen before. Overall it was a good place to bring the kids.
,,Tropical Paradise,5.0,,"A fantastic place to spend a day. The natural jungle setting allows you to see most of the birds in close to their normal habitat. There is plenty of information for those who want to learn about the birds. But the colors and sounds of the birds are enough to just lose yourself in the atmosphere. There are opportunities to interact with the birds. It is clear that the park takes very good care of the them.

I highly recommend purchasing the combination admission tickets with the Zoo and / or Night Safari. All are must see activities in Singapore and the savings are great."
,,Go the birds!!,5.0,,Don't miss this attraction. Fabulous environment with fabulous array of colourful birds. Can easily spend a day there. Lots of things to see. The shows were good too. Well worth a visit.
,,Bird paradise !,4.0,,"It was a hot sweaty summer day in a coastal Singapore!! but once I entered, jurong bird park, the only thing I noticed and remembered was birds, birds and birds !! squeeking, crooning, singing, croaking all sorts of bird. Birds from different countries, different species, different colours. They were adorable. I had only seen in national geographic such birds, you can buy a special ticket to feed the parakeets, who are very friendly.
The park is not big and conveniently you could either travel by toy train within the park.. or walk up and down to see all the birds !"
,,"Overall, good.",4.0,,"There are some lovely aspects to Jurong. The large aviaries and ponds work well from a visitor point of view and from an animal's point of view. There is a good level of social interaction for the animals and appropriate behavioural enrichment, and of course enough flight space.

Conversely, the smaller aviaries with the hornbills, the birds of paradise and the raptors are little more than a stamp collection. It is difficult to take any written interpretation panel seriously when so often they mentioned conservation concerns due to removal of animals from the wild, when it is difficult to see clearly what Jurong is doing that is a good example. There were some spaces that paid too little heed to the animal's well being.

The park was well presented, the staff had a great customer service ethic, and the entry price very reasonable."
,,A nice partial zoo.,3.0,,"This is a nice bird park, which is located away from everything (come on, Singapore, an MRT is a must here...).
The park isn't huge, but includes some very nice birds, some of which I was unfamiliar with (especially the dinosaur-like cassowary).
It is quite obvious this park is intended to be visited in a combined ticket with the zoo, so I refer to it as a ""partial zoo"".
2 hours would do the trick. 3 hours, if you bring the kids as well."
,,~~~~WORLD OF AVES~~~~,5.0,,"It is really enchanting & an golden opportunity for bird viewers.There are lots of exotic birds of different sizes,shapes & colours.I really spent my whole day there watching & feeding them.There are different bird shows. It was little bit scary to me when a large egale just flew over my head.If you really brave then you can volunteer to hold those mighty egales on your hand & feed them. The penguin coast was really cool. I also took the train whose ticket was of 5 dollar to see the top view of the whole park.I also loved the swan lake,bird of paradise & hornbills.I also took photo with cute parrots & penguins.It was really a great & busy day for me......"
,,A great place to spend half a day!,5.0,,"It's all birds, birds and more birds at Jurong Bird Park! And what have you - peachy flamingos, cockatoos, macaws, parrots, mynas - the works!"
,,Colourful!!!!,5.0,,"This is a must do activity when in Singapore - the colours of the birds were incredible. When walking thru the avaries you need to stop and look both up and down as there is so much to see. The flamigos of course are a great attraction, I found the owls very interesting too. The penguins were unexpected but wonderful to see so close up."
,,Spend a day!,5.0,,You really need a whole day here to see everything and it's worth stopping for the shows - amazing singing parrot - and the birds of prey flights are great. The train ride round the park gives you an idea of the layout but it is worth walking round (slowly as it's very hot!) as the park also has some wonderful flowers and plants. The lory loft is great fun and the African aviary with the waterfall is amazing. The aviaries are well designed so that you can view the birds from different angles.
,,Surely a MRT station is overdue here?,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is one of the must-see attractions of Singapore. Yes, it is hot and humid, but what do you expect half a degree from the equator: just walk slowly and think beautiful thoughts. Unfortunately the overhead monorail is no longer running:looking down on the flamingo pool was a highlight of previous visits. It has been replaced by a road train that you can hop on and off. Since the Gardens by the Bay opened the waterfall at Jurong is no longer the world's highest man-made waterfall, but as the ""highest man-made waterfall in a bird park"", it's still impressive. The other highlight is feeding the birds in the giant lory enclosure. Perhaps the eagles could have larger enclosures to stretch their wings a bit. Surely it's time the government extended their excellent MRT to Jurong."
,,Wonderful Bird Park!,5.0,,I visited the Jurong Bird Park during my last trip to Singapore over twenty years ago and I was eager to return as I enjoy watching birds. It's an amazing place with so many birds in different habitats. The birds of prey show was a little corny but I did enjoy it! Well worth the visit..
,,Great place for kids,4.0,,Lots of activities for children - the water park was great Use the shuttle to get around Bus service from Boon Lay
,,All birds you know and don't know,4.0,,"We have visited this park twice by now. First time the weather was cooler and we had enjoyed the day more, this time it was hot and we had a child with us who complained about being hot all the time.
The park is lovely, we liked the Penguins a lot, the facility is lovely and there is AC there also :)"
,,"Manicured, just like the rest of Singapore",5.0,,"I love Singapore as everything seems to be working. Similarly, the Bird Park is so enchanting, lots of varieties, yes they are caged, but I can see that they are well taken care of. I would have wanted to be a bird at the bird park!

And dont miss the bird show. Very entertaining, even for me."
,,A fun daily adventure in Singapore,3.0,,"This Bird Park was a fun day for the kids.There are several large enclosures with a wide diversity of birds. The facility is clean and comfortable and all of the animals are in wonderful health.We only attended one scheduled show, and it was only average. That said, it was not disappointing. On a scale of 1 - 10 my children (ages 7 - 12) rated this park a 7, and they have seen MANY MANY similar parks around the world,"
,,"Must visit, specially for families with young kids",5.0,,"Before going for the Bird Park, we were actually wondering whether we should go for it considering that we already had enough of wildlife animal at Zoo as well as Night Safari...But by the end of the trip, I am sure it should be part of everyone's list of things to be seen while in Singapore...

Here are a few practical tips, more so for those with young kids (i went there with wife & out twin daughters aged 3 yrs)

1. Bird Park, unlike Zoo, does not necessitate a full day trip - I am assuming here that you would be short on time & would want to cover as much as possible within your stay in Singapore. Would recommend a 5-6 hour trip, which should be sufficient to include both the 2 shows as well as kids spending some time in the ""Birds of Play"" (bird themed dry & wet play area)
2. Reach there early in time to catch the first bird show at 10 AM...There are specific times for these shows - so you catch the 2 shows at 10 & 11 AM & thereafter be left with enough time to explore the entire Bird Park.
3. Carry / hire stroller for your kids as you would not want to carry around the kids...In fact, we hired a stroller for the entire week we spent in Singapore...
4. Cab is the fastest way to reach Bird Park - we reached in 30 min flat from our hotel in Little India...You would save a few dollars by taking MRT & then bus from the closest MRT but may not be worth the additional 30-40 min extra...
5. Definitely spend some time feeding the colourful birds at the Aviary, kids will love that experience..."
,,The best place to know about birds,5.0,,"With family or with friends, this is a wonderful place to visit in Singapore to watch birds. You will easily spend more than 3 hours. There are so Many birds to see, appreciate and interact with such as the lory. The birds are well taken caren of, and also the place and 100% you will see all the birds even the awl that are in the dark rooms with air conditioning. Transport is easy and available. Ensure to take your camera and sun block, for the time I went umbrella was a must since it rained. Highly recommended."
,,Recommended Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is one of recommended place to visit when we are in Singapore. Since the price is not expensive and you can see many attractions inside the Jurong Bird Park. Beside various of birds, you can also enjoy the very conceptual facilities at Jurong Bird Park. From Rain Forrest area, the huge bird cage with various parrots and also little waterboom inside the Jurong Bird Park.

Since the park is wide, you can pay for tram inside the park to take you to many facilities inside the park. It is a worthed place to visit in Singapore in my opinion.

Various kind of birds from pinguins, flamengo, many kind of big birds and also parrots will make you enjoy your visit to the park. And also you can see very beautiful front gate of The Jurong Bird Park. For further information about Jurong Bird Park you can see here.

If you plan to visit Singapore Zoo, you can also buy the Singapore Zoo ticket at Jurong Bird Park. And of course, you will get more cheaper for the 2-in-1 ticket (Jurong Bird Park and Singapore Zoo) than if you buy the tickets separately. And here are some photos inside the Jurong Bird Park.

- Please freely to visit my travel reviews at www.AndreHandoyo.com -"
,,Great Experiecnc,4.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park gives the feel that all that the birds are in their natural surrounds. The number of different species is incredible.

The waterfall looks as if it is also natural and not man made.

The bird shows are something that should not be missed with the Penguin being our favorite.

We were also surprised to see Puffin Birds on display. This was areal treat as we previously travel to the Far North East of North America and failed to see any at all.

A must see for all the family."
,,"Lots of activities, lots of birds, very well managed",5.0,,"very expensive food selling inside, i usually bring my own food. Definitely should go for all the bird shows and feeding the birds."
,,A must see for all bird lovers,5.0,,It is an amazing collection of different bird species. The shows are very well done. The birds have been trained well to perform some amazing feats. We all loved it !!
,,A Must Visit,5.0,,"This is my 4th time I visited the Bird Park over the last decade or so and it never cease to amaze me. The Bird Show is especially good for the kids. Even the Birds have gone environmental friendly these days.

It was unfortunate that the monorail was down when we last visited but otherwise the whole experience was amazing.

The photoshooting near the entrance was I thought extremely expensive though and the buffet for the lunch with the Birds was also very costly with a so-so only buffet and show.

All in all the visit was a good experience, especially with the several bird shows.... Now visitors can also visit the breeding and research centre to see how some of the birds in the park were hatched and nurtured before being released to the park...."
,,Birds and water.,5.0,,Wonderful park. Clean. Well kept. Water park was loved by the children. Don't forget to take your swimming costume. So many birds and all so interesting. Cost us not cheap but worth seeing.
,,Great fun!,5.0,,"Was hesitant about going to a bird park but since I'm an ""animal"" person I thought I'd give it a try. Was tremendously impressed by the variety and number of birds. The park is well laid out and even with many visitors you don't usually feel the crush of the crowd unlike the Night Safari. Kids will love this place especially the younger ones."
,,Birds and more birds,4.0,,"Great place for families. Many birds to see. You get to see birds that you might not have seen even in the wild! Owls, eagles, flamingos, parrot, sparrow, crow, hawk you name it they are there!"
,,Up close and personal to Birds like never before!,4.0,,The bird park was such a treat! Its kept really well and the best part was the bird feeding place where for $3 we bought bird feed and the birds came up to us to eat right out of our hands! Wonderful experience!
,,Pretty nice place!,4.0,,"We went to Jurong Bird Park when my daughter was 1 year old, it's interesting place. But it's quite small park. The ticket is pretty expensive, i would rather choose Singapore Zoo which more varieties."
,,One day visit to Jurong Bird Park,5.0,,"Singapore is one of my favourites.I insisted my tour operator Sachin Travels & my tourist
group to accomodate visit to this beautiful place by shortening the time for shopping.
After the tour every one thanked me for this out of the world experience.
The amphi theatre,the train ride, the owl training show & hornbills are wonderful experiences.
If you go Singapore please dont miss it."
,,Poor park,2.0,,"It was better distance then the zoo, but there were not much visitor here!

Great view but not much attraction here!

You'll just walking around and you'll get a lot of knowledge about bird and bird and more bird!

Because there was a lot of big tree there, so the air was fresh"
,,"Count the parrots, see the eagles",5.0,,"I have been 3 times to this park, twice in one month. Walk over the parrot forest above the trees and there are hundreds of them. Wonderful. Sea Eagles are huge and well kept. In fact for a non-bird lover who just likes to see things in as natural as it's possible in a place of captivity this place beats them all except possible Howletts Tigers near Canterbury, England. If you do nothing else in Singapore go there, you won't be disappointed."
,,Best park I've ever been too,5.0,,"Jurong's bird park is ideal for children, adults and old folks. It is very peaceful, scenic and user friendly. There are sooo many birds in this park that I never knew existed. The bird shows, the water park and the general layout of this park is absolutely brilliant. Kudos to the people who designed this park, maintain this park and carry out general park operations. Jurong bird park is a must see attraction in singapore."
,,Incredibly fun!,5.0,,"My husband and I thought that we would not be impressed at all by the bird park after having visited the zoo a day before. But we were wrong. We spent about 4 hours there and we probably would have stayed more if the rain hadn't started.
You can get there by MRT and bus (MRT to Boon Lay Station and transfer to SBS number 194 or 251 - 1 long station). It takes quite a while to get there, so get up early! If you want to sleep more, take a taxi!
The park entrance is absolutely beautiful; there are colorful orchids everywhere.
Inside we could see imperial penguins, flamingos, swans, all sorts of parrots, hornbills, Mandarin ducks and various other birds from Africa and Asia. There are lots of bird shows as well that are worth checking out, especially if you have children.
What impressed us the most was the Lory Loft, where you could feed lories (a cup of food was 3 SGD) and they would jump on your arms or shoulders. It was a fun experience!
I must say that visiting the Zoo is not enough. You should definitely visit both the zoo AND the bird park for an unbelievable experience!

Tip 1: You can have breakfast at a restaurant in front of the park entrance. It costs 5.5 SGD.
Tip 2: Bring an umbrella! The weather is unpredictable in Singapore."
,,Best bird park ever seen,5.0,,"Top for kids and family.
You won't be disappointed if you enjoy birds!
there are many species to see, you can see them fed, fly, ...
Lots of freedom in this park for the birds. It makes the atmosphere really great.
Advice: come EARLY in the morning... At noon, there will be lots of people. It is great to start at the opening."
,,Zoo or Bird Park first? Bird Park - you'd be spoilt by the zoo,4.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is, in my opinion, the #2 attraction as a must-see for families with young kids in Singapore. The zoo is just that much harder to beat and the bird park will feel like an old-fashioned zoo or prison compared to the open spaces and freedom of the zoo (for its visitors and animals alike). First off: getting there - unlike the zoo which is in the middle fo the island, the bird park is almost as far West (in the part of town called Jurong) as the airport is East, so needless to say both MRT and bus or other transit combination will take a long time to get there. Taxi is a bit more but with the convenience, air conditioned ride, and speed of travel - save yourself a couple of hours and take a taxi. It's really not that expensive.

Unlike the zoo, the bird park hasn't gone through as many renovations and will seem a bit dated (hence the recommendation to go here first) since the exhibits can fly - most things have to be behind bars (cages etc), which really does spoil many photo opporunities since youwill have those annoying bars in your photo and the camera will hve a hard time focusing on what you want (bars or bird?). The attraction itself is chock a block with birds, birds and more birds and along with most things in Singapore, is world class. Get there early in order to catch the shows, and along with my recommendations for the zoo - around 930am is best. Since these are birds, they can be fairly noisy and I found that the paths are not as well marked as the zoo and the way for you to get to the next exhibits a bit unclear - we had to back track a couple fo times, and it is a bit harrowing with a stroller in the mid-day tropic sun and humidity. Some exhibits may not seem stroller friendly at all - but you have to walk to the far side to find the access that you can roll up to (again, not good signage). THere used to be a monorail that went around the park but this is broken down and likely to be replaced entirely with the same tram system that is at the zoo for good reason - it's cheaper but it does rob one of spectacular ways to see the birds and the giant aviaries.

Hint: you will come away with several hundred pics of colourful birds and have no idea when you get home (take a picture of the exhibit name)."
,,Not for those with ornithophobia!,4.0,,"This is a wonderful way to spend a morning. It took us 5 hours to walk the entire way around the park, including going to the bird shows. There are so many wonderful and colourful birds in this park from all around the world. The parrot section was particularly noisy and some of them respond to prompts. The park was easy to get to using the MRT then a bus. Staff are friendly and helpful. Food onsite is rather expensive but you can bring your own."
,,"Birds, Birds & Birds",5.0,,"If you love watching birds you must visit this place. Thousands of birds from all over the world in different specious and colors. Do visit morning time ( I think the park opens at 8.30 AM) so that you can experience the birds and nature. There are few bird shows, please do not miss first two , do not remember the exact timings are very attractive. The best attraction according to me is lory feeding. In morning time these birds are very hungry and while feeding them they come and sit on all parts of your body. You can purchase food for ~ 3 SGD. But if go very late they had already fed enough and may not interested in any food given by you. The African waterfall, according to our guide, the world’s largest man made waterfall, and it seems to be..!!! Suggest both walking and tram ride to see the entire park. Entry ticket is ~ SGD 18, but better go for a single pass for ~SGD 58 covering all three attractions . night Safari, Singapore Zoo & Jurong Bird Park .

We have been to here three times. This place is very clean and well maintained. Jurong is the industrial area and getting into here is not a problem, cost you ~SGD 20 and 30 minutes drive from the city by cab."
,,Best place for kids..and adults too...!,4.0,,"This is one of the place that you should visit in Singapore, especially when you are with kids.. My kids enjoyed it very much, especially the Penguin Coast... You can see many kinds of penguins, and my kids loved to see the way they walk and swim. And you can also see many kinds of owl in the Birds of Darkness, very informative and interesting. Don't miss feeding the birds at Lory Loft, it's fun and kids will love it. The shows were entertaining, so be sure to check the time schedule.
There is also a tram, but walking is also nice because there are many birds exhibits to see along the way."
,,Great collection of birds for young and old.,4.0,,"Unfortunately missed the morning bird show check times before you go.The Mono rail is no longer operational but they have a $5 train that does the circuit but only four stops and we ended up walking most of the way round so if you are fit save $5.
Well signposted .The penguins look a bit sad.Not needed.
Take lots of liquid.Got an icecream half way round at shop.
Not sure why Jurong is not in with Singapore things to do.?
Taxi cost $28 from town (15 min) Plenty for return trip.Allow 2 to 3 Hours."
,,Lovely attraction for kids and adults,5.0,,We enjoyed all the exhibits. We walked all the way and the energy and enthusiasm from seeing the exhibits carried us through. Don't miss the bird shows.
,,Huge Bird Park,5.0,,"This Bird Park is huge with gardens, ponds, restaurants and sceneries inside.
There are numerous types of Birds that you will see inside and able to interact with.
There are even Bird Shows that you will surely enjoy.

Be sure to bring umbrellas as the park is open and weather is unpredictable.
Wear comfortable shoes since you will be going for long walks."
,,Great place to take visitors,5.0,,We spent a very a very relaxed morning at the bird park. It is an easier place to go to with kids and grandparents. The layout is better than the zoo and the hop on an off train makes it very accessible. There is even a small water park so pack bathers for the kids.
,,Close Encounters With All Kinds Of Birds,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a unique experience, because they have designed the place to include many free flight aviaries, which allows you to get right next to many species of birds. But even in their normal non-free flight enclosures, you can still get pretty close to the birds.

Jurong Bird Park also has the world's largest man-made waterfall, in the African Waterfall Aviary. Be sure to explore the upper levels, where you'll be able to see various species of African Birds.

Another highlight of the Jurong Bird Park is their Lory Loft, which features 2 suspension bridges, and many colourful, friendly Lories that will perch on you if you allow it (and if you feed them).

Some of the best chances you'll have to see the main species of birds featured at the Jurong Bird Park is in their shows. Kings Of The Skies Show (10am and 4pm) showcases various birds of prey, and demonstrates their hunting abilities. Birds N Buddies Show (11am and 3pm) showcases the more friendly, and domesticated types of birds, including macaws, flamingos and pelicans. The star of the show is Amigo, a singing parrot that speaks 3 languages!

Personally, my favourite enclosure at the Jurong Bird Park is probably the Penguin Coast. Being able to see the different penguins, and even puffins, in a 'natural' enclosure, up-close, was amazing.

However, one thing I felt that Jurong Bird Park could do better, is housing some species of birds in glass enclosures, instead of metal cage enclosures. This includes the Hornbills & Toucans, Parrots and Birds Of Prey. Visitors can get then have a clearer view of the birds through the glass.

If you're planning a visit, do note that admission fees cost $18, and allocate between 2 to 5 hours for viewing."
,,Beautiful and Smelly,4.0,,"prepare your nose, these birds are smelly but beautiful!"
,,What a colourful world,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is also another must when visiting Singapore! The species of birds they have are just ""wow"" - all so colourful and beautiful. They also have this prehistoric looking bird (it is real!). The shows are also great too!

You could finish the park in 3-4 hours (that was based on walking the whole park), so if you start in the morning you could finish off your afternoon/evening by visiting Clark Quay which the Jurong Bird Park shuttle bus stops at. Tram rides are also available (don't think it's included in the entry price)

The shuttle bus costs SG$9/adult each way and takes about 45min. So just like the zoo, put on your comfortable walking shoes, bring some food and water, your camera and enjoy the day with some feathered friends.

Just a tip, if it ends up being a humid/muggy day (which is mostly the Discovery Centre is a great way to cool down!"
,,Enjoyable and informative,5.0,,"Its a lovely way to spend a morning, watching birds of all kinds of feathers flocking together in one park( though separate enclosures!). The parrots are pretty; the tram ride through the main areas of the park is a bit too fast so that one cant see some of the birds at all while passing by! The separate enclosures for different species of owls and for penguins were very interesting too. The morning show with performing birds is hugely entertaining and must be watched. One has to check out the show timins from before so as not to miss it as it probably occurs only twice in the morning. There wasn't much in terms of eateries within the park apart from ones supplying light drinks and snacks. Children enjoyed the park and esp the show a lot."
,,Plenty of birds in small park,4.0,,Pros (1) Loads of birds (2) Park is not big and is walkable. (3) New kids' water playground (4) Mature trees and vegetation Cons (1) Getting dated (2) Zoo is a better attraction
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"Pleasant walk - clean surroundings. I think the tram ride could be included in the ticket price as seniors might need this facility even though they started out walking. Not too crowded on a week day, so that's good."
,,Walk-in aviary experience,4.0,,"Do *walk* around the bird park - the ENTIRE bird park - it will take you the vast majority of a day, but it is well worth it.

Make sure to bring along insect repellant, especially for the ""African"" bird, walk-in aviary, it is most jungle like, with the mozzies to match. Stupidly I did not have insect repellant, and after about 20 or so painful bites, as I am loved to death by the biters, a very fast, hot and bothered walk back to the main entrance allowed me to purchase the much needed repellant (spray on $7.90SPD).

Even on a weekday, it can get quite crowded, especially with school groups, so plan your walk by avoiding the 10am showing of the Birds of Prey (if there are school groups), to check out many of the other very excellent exhibits in relative quietness (you can always do BoP later in the day). The numerous walk-in aviaries are extensive and fabulous, and do experience the Noon ""thunderstorm"" it was most fun, and refreshing.

The penguin display is quite surreal, especially if you have visited Antarctica.

The ability to view ducks and turtles at water level was fun. And the Hornbills most exotic. Take the time to stand and look and watch for them, sometimes well hidden in their enclosures.

Excellent collection of parrots, some cockatoos I had never even heard of. I found all of the information boards to be educational and up to date.

Lories and Lorikeets super fun! Spend the $3 SPD, for the nectar feed and be delighted.

We caught a taxi from our Clark Quay hotel - 20 minutes, $15 SPD. Could have caught the MRT and a bus, but it was a stinking hot day. Drink plenty of water - take frequent breaks (there are a few air-conditioned venues, including educational ones), plus a nice late lunch at the Wings Cafe, Chicken rice of course, then re-entered the park to finish with the Owls and a second visit to the Flamingos.

Parts of the park were looking a little tired (the monorail is no longer in service), but it was nice to see employees working on new boardwalks across waterways, planting out new garden beds etc."
,,lovely birds with plenty of varity,4.0,,"This is a nice outing to see a great variety of birds. One of my favorites was the many species of pigeons, but the lorries are also amazingly fun. There is a convenient tram if you're willing to pay, but the walk around the park is really lovely by itself if the weather is good. Some of the wire enclosures were covered with moss and could use some cleaning and refreshing, but otherwise they are nice."
,,Jurong Bird Park,4.0,,"Beautiful place with such colorful birds that you get to see from such close distance. The place is lush green and absolutely fresh with the only sound of birds chirping all around you. The only thing that adds color to the otherwise green paradise is the color of the birds... Lovely colored birds, of all size and shapes, largest man made waterfall and a beautiful show with owls and vultures and eagles. People with good camera would love this place, they would get plenty to click around! :)"
,,Bird paradise,5.0,,"A wonderful sanctuary of birds - from penguins to the Ostrich and everything in between. Do visit on a weekday when there's fewer crowds. Easily accessible by cab/MRT/bus. Get the Park Hopper ticket that lets you visit three attractions with savings - Singapore Zoo, Night Safari, and Jurong Bird Park. The shows are amazing...don't miss them!"
,,Birds all over the World,3.0,,"A great place to visit to see all kinds of birds around the globe. Remember to catch the shows timing right and feeding sessions, be there early and check out their website for their itinerary before heading down."
,,What a great surprise!,5.0,,"We took the MRT and then a bus to the Bird Park. Very easy to travel by public transportation so don't let that scare you off. We weren't going to go to the park because we thought it might by the typical zoo experience--lots of animals in cages. Just the opposite! The park design allows visitors the most close-up experience possible without actually holding the birds. There were birds that we have in Minnesota that we've never seen close and now we know what they look like. Many birds were nesting and we got to see the feeding (regurgitating of fish) of their young. There were two shows that should not be missed. They occur twice per day. There's also a lory station where you can actually have the birds perch on your hands.

The park is lovely and not to be missed!"
,,Your layover destination,3.0,,"Me and my partner are on 8 hours self-transit. We decided to skip any shopping malls as we are on budget. Taking train from Airport to Jurong Stn would take less than an hour. Then we take free shuttle bus at Jurong Interchange to bird park. We have very high expectations during entering this park.

Generally we like this park for its information, guide, ambiance, cleanliness, etc. The love the penguins so much! But it lose the originality! We spotted a bell-sized green speaker which transmit pre recorded sounds of birds. Thats so artificial! Maybe the management should hide those speaker to give more forest feel.

The lake smell so bad! We can't take it any longer and pass that area very fast. The worst, this one 'big bird' made our visit not so worth...jet fighter with a very very loud sound are everywhere! I wonder is this part of the 'bird show'? Why the jet fighter doing training at the air of the park? Spoiled our mood..."
,,really awesome!,4.0,,"the best part of the park was lory feeding. it was amazing how those lories just come and sit on your shoulders and head when they see the cup in your hand.

check the map properly before you enter and don't miss the shows. have lots of time and go as this takes up a full half day to enjoy everything.

Worth visiting once."
,,Must see for all ages,4.0,,"We took a taxi there with a very informative guide, the park was interesting we too the tram only to the first stop but found we saw more walking around by ourselves, good half day tour, good for all ages"
,,really enjoyed the park!,5.0,,"I went with my friend & her 10 year old, we were on vacation & we saw the ad in the subway and decided to go. We got a late start but at least were able to see 1 show the birds of prey show amazing to be so close to these magnificant birds, they fly in for the show right over our heads, very entertaining. It was hot which i assume is the norm, the childrens water play area looked so inviting I got right in there, had a blast plus was cool for rest of the day! the walk thru areas are amazing to be that close to the birds was exciting, & I realized a childhood dream to see the bird of paradise was amazing not sure if we have any in our zoos in the states so it was a special treat, the tram came in handy to take a break from walking in the oppressive heat. I recommend this for people with children, or anyone who loves to see wildlifeup close and personal!"
,,"Aviaries have very little birds, most beautiful ones in separate cages",2.0,,"This park was a disappointment as there wasnot very many colourful birds to seein the aviaries, the fancy colour parrots, tucans etc. Were all in enclosed cages behind the bars so that cannot even get good photos.

Would say tat this is not worth the go if youhave been in some other bird parks before."
,,Beautiful bird park,5.0,,"This is a fantastic activity for young and old. We spent about 4 hours wandering through this pristinely clean, landscaped park. The birds are spectacular and the information available enhances the visit.
My seven year old also loved the water park for kids. The facilities were spotless with change rooms and showers available. Shade can be a little hard to find so pack a hat or parasol!
We took a taxi from beach road at the cost of about $15 and it took about twenty minutes. The three park pass is best value and include the zoo and night safari. You have a month to use the ticket.
A great morning out and about"
,,"Such beautiful birds, too bad they are caged up",4.0,,"We visited July 1st. Was a $19 taxi (20 minute) ride from the Marina Bay area. Got there around 10:45 and went straight to the Birds and Buddies show. It was adorable, with a parrot singing in Malay and counting in Chinese. (Sit close to the stage for best pictures as all birds fly to the front for posing).
The monorail is no longer working. We paid $5 extra for the tram, however no one ever checked our tickets. Could have rode all day, but it was not necessary. The park is small compared to most theme parks, and is very walkable, unless you have very small chilldren. We got to the Lory Loft around noon and the birds were plenty hungry. The cups are very big and it takes the birds a long time to eat through one cup of the liquid food, so you can buy one cup and have your whole family take pictures with the birds. It takes a few birds around 8-10 minutes to get through one cup of food.The Lory birds are quite colorful birds and not afraid of people at all.
The conures and parrots and macaws are kept behind small steel cages with thick bars, and it makes picture taking difficult. It would be nicer to see the birds fly around in larger areas. The flamingos and pelicans are kept in a more open area, and you can get plenty of pictures there.
We walked the park in a couple of hours seeing everything. It will take longer with young children. Having recently visited the Galapagos Islands and hiking in Costa Rica, this bird park can't compare, but if you have not experienced seeing wild birds before i would recommend this park.
There is not much shade inside this park, so bring a hat or umbrella as the locals do. It gets very hot inside the park."
,,A must do.,5.0,,"Visited Jurong biird park 23.6.2012 we had a wonderful experience, plenty of birds to see,great bird show for free, tram made it easy to get around, park gardens beautiful & clean staff friendly & helpful, booked online no lines no waiting.don't miss this experience."
,,A great day out for the family,5.0,,"We had a great day at Jurong with our two children aged 4 & 6. We arrived shortly after opening time (8.30am) and felt like we had the place to ourselves. The taxi ride from our hotel at Clarke Quay was about $18 and took approx 25 minutes. We managed to see about half the park before the ""Kings of the Sky"" show at 10.00am.

The two main restaurants are located outside the main gate so you need to get a ""pass stamp"" to get back in if you head out to purchase food. We took the kids swimming costumes and spent a great lunch hour at the ""Birdz of Play"" water area, I couldn't believe there were only about 10 children enjoying this great facility. There was a ""Ben & Jerry's"" (expensive) ice cream shop and gift shop in the area. There were great toilets and changing facilities in this area as well as a parent's room for feeding/changing babies. I went out to the ""Bongo Burgers"" to get some food to bring back into the park for lunch.

The monorail wasn't operating when we were there but there was a tram service - I don't know if this is a permanent arrangement. Take the tram to the Lory Station (stop 2) as it's a fairly steep hill to get there and then it's a pleasant downhill walk arouond the park.

We enjoyed our day with all the different types of birds in their various settings and the waterpark was a bonus."
,,Up Close and Personal with the birds,5.0,,"Timings – Open Daily. 8:30 AM to 6 PM.

Tickets can be purchased online or at any of the three parks, tickets are valid for 30 days from the date of purchase and visit to all the three parks need not be on the same day.
• Entry Fee - 18 SGD
• Tram Ride - 8:30 AM to 6 PM. Cost - 5 SGD

Better buy Tickets online beforehand, Three-In-One ticket (Park Hopper) including Jurong Bird Park, Night Safari, Singapore Zoo is a very good deal. Costs 58 SGD or INR 3052.13.

Price includes admission to the Park and unlimited Tram Ride.
Take the Map at the entrance.

Don’t miss the great display of Orchids right at the entrance.

Both the cafes at the entrance offer Vegetarian food options also.

Bathroom facilities available.

The Pano Rail is closed, its only the Tram Ride that is available.

Will take around 4 hrs

Tram Ride – Costs 5 SGD. The tram pass does not give you unlimited rides. It limits each person to getting on once per station. Enter the park and keep to the left. Do not take the train from Main Station, instead take it from Lory Station (2nd station), after you visit the Lory Loft. I recommend taking a tram ride for an overview of the park, then explore the park on foot and get up close with the birds.

Penguin Exhibit - 2 penguin displays. One inside and one out. The inside display is with the above and below water viewing.
There are 4 Flight Aviaries - African Waterfall Aviary, South East Asian Birds Aviary, Lory Loft, Jungle Jewels.

African Waterfall Aviary – Has a 30-meter high man-made waterfall, the water makes a lot of noise and looks quite creepy if you are alone, has a dense forest feeling.

Southeast Asian Birds Aviary – They have a thunderstorm simulator which happens at some stipulated time.

Lory Loft and Lory Feeding- walk-in flight aviary with lots and lots of free-flying lories. You can purchase a cup of special nectar mix (SG$3) and feed the birds who flock right on our shoulders & arms to feed on the mixture and they eat right out of your hands. If you visit the Lorry too late (after 10.30am), they are not hungry, they will not eat the food you give. You will be surrounded by dozens of the colourful lories while you walk on the suspended bridges at tree top level.

There are three shows - Kings of the Skies Show, Birds and Buddies Show and Lunch with Parrots.
Kings of the Skies Show – Must Watch. Talks about falconry. The birds fly to the centre stage from every corner of the amphitheatre, right over your head and past your shoulders.

Birds and Buddies Show – Must watch, out of three this is the best. Amazing performances by cockatoos, macaws, pelicans, hornbills etc. Two shows – 11 AM and 3 PM.

Lunch with Parrots – Did not attend. Purchase of food and beverage item is required to watch this show. Daily Show at 1 PM.

Eating Option – Bongo Burgers has some vegetarian options. Hawk Cafe has a Vegetarian Biryani Rice Set option which practically sucks. But the associated Ben and Jerry Ice cream is very good."
,,Amazing Displays of Birdlife,4.0,,"I visited Jurong as part of a zoo package offer ($58) for all 3 attractions including the train tours at each park and was pleasantly surprised at how good this park actually is. The range of birdlife on view was vast and no matter where you are from I think you will be impressed. There are birds from most continents displayed in fairly natural enlosures and most species have several birds (not just one or two) the waterfall is quite impressive but I did see several mosquitoes there. I saw many birds,that I hadn't ever seen before from the Africas. Birds were fairly easy to spot and the descriptions of them and their native habitats were most informative. You are able to have your picture taken with some amazing parrots (for a price) if you want to and itnwould make a lovely souveneir for children or a famiky group. The park is quite a way to get to on the MRT so allow a full day to see everthing at a leisurely pace"
,,"Nice, Clean and well Organized",4.0,,"Very nice park, a good variety of birds, specially a go if you have kids, very educational.
plan to be there for half a day atleast as the park itself is not more than 2 hrs but the shows are a must see if you plan to visit !!"
,,Couldn't have Scored a Better Deal...and It's Not the Great Singapore Sale!,5.0,,"I went to Singapore on the opening week of the Great Singapore Sale 2012 and anyone would have gone crazy with the mark downs. But nothing beats the value you get for the $18 entrance to Jurong Bird Park. Amazing! And so I am going back in October, with my toddler this time for her 3rd birthday. I couldn't be any more excited for her.

I have not seen a more well-maintained park than this, considering the volume of visitors they get everyday. More importantly, when you see the birds especially in the bird shows, you'll feel that Jurong Bird Park really is all about Education and Conservation. You know the birds are in good hands - while they have been trained to perform, you know that outside the performance they're made to live as if they're in the wild. Not commercial at all - with the exception of the Lory Loft, which I am sure generates a lot of income for the park, but which I enjoyed so much because the birds just seemed to love me and so I got a lot of great pictures with them (pictures bought and taken by my husband - you really don't have to buy as you can take all the pictures you want).

Some tips - planning is a must. The park is huge and there are two shows that you shouldn't miss - Kings of the Skies and Birds n Buddies. So make sure to check their website http://www.birdpark.com.sg/index.html for the show schedule and the map and the many options to get there. Especially if you're traveling with children (or even if you're not) and if you don't have all day to spend in the park, planning is key. You might not have enough time to see all exhibits so you better choose which ones to. If you're with children, make sure to set aside an hour at least for Birds of Play - an excellent playground in the water! That and the two shows could easily take up 4 hours of your day.

If you're traveling on a budget, then bring your own refreshments. Expect a lot of walking so wear your most comfortable footwear and have plenty of water.

A must see if you're in Singapore. One couldn't really score a better deal!"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Have had the pleasure of being here twice. I have never experienced anythin better. A magnificent place for the family to visit. The main show is an amazing experience. We will be back.
,,Large Bird Space,4.0,,"Singapore seems like one of the largest bird creation in the world, huge variety of birds, if you love birds, you will sure find it good. I am quite lucky to go in for free with company benefits.

Not a bird person but do enjoy the 2 bird shows. That is quite entertaining and not to be missed.

1st Bird show - 10am & 3am
2nd Hawk show - 11am & 4pm"
,,Glorious!,5.0,,Amazing array of birds on display. Great Shows too! Take Sunscreen and a hat! its hot hot hot out there!
,,Excellent Family Outing,5.0,,"Donot miss this vibrant park. I have been here three times and have enjoyed this park with my family. If you are in singapore, this is a must visit location. It's pleasing to the sight and senses."
,,A must for Bird Lovers,5.0,,"We visited the Bird Park in combination with the SIngapore Zoo + Night Safari. There are a wide variety of birds on display and the enclosures are good sized. There is also interaction with the birds such as feeding the lorikeets which I totally loved.

One suggestion, if you are prone to getting insect bites, make sure to take loads of insect repellent with you. I didn't and I got bitten all over!"
,,"Good, if you like birds",4.0,,If you are a bird watcher or if you are traveling with kids then this place is a must-do.. lots of unique birds of various sizes and colors and great to see.. The shows are really nice.. They make the birds do lots of things and its nice to see that happening.. pretty good overall for the different types of birds and the various acts.. Will recommend half a day for this and if you are planning to visit the Night Safari then please do buy the combo ticket.. $42 for both. There is a shuttle bus from Jurong to Night Safari so you should try and take that if you don't have your own transport..
,,Bird paradise!!,4.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is a wonderful and unique attraction of Singapore. The innumerable birds make this a great place to visit, specially the flamingoes and parrots. The rainforest ambience adds to its allure. My kids loved feeding the parrots and the close proximity with them. The photo-op is quite commercial, yet good. A great memory to take from our visit to S'pore. Its easy to roam around with the frequent tram service, and the shows are great too. A must visit!"
,,"If you enjoy birds and nature, this is for you",5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a fantastic place for a family day out - provided you like birds, this is reasonably priced option for an entertaining afternoon. It's very clean, very safe and in very good condition.

Wheelchairs and electric scooters are available for visitors with limited mobility, as well as an in-park tram available for all visitors.

There are several live bird shows, a variety of avian enclosures with all the favourites from penguins to birds of prey, as well as a small water park where kids under 12 can have a fantastic time with their parents.

The highlight for us was the Lorikeet enclosure, with dozens of Australian parakeets and lorikeets- for a modest amount you can buy feed and have them eat out of your palm and walk on your arms.

In all, the Jurond Bird Park is a fantastic place."
,,"If you did not see it, you do not love nature",5.0,,"It is amazing to see that such a small country like Singapore has so much nature-consciousness that they have set aside a complete and self-sustained tropical forest.

Different species of birds, live shows, multiple attractions, easy access of all parts of the park through train or road - all of them add feathers in its cap. Special care is taken for endangered species.

A walk around the park would easily take one full day, so be careful to carry water bottles and a towel. Singapore, being a tropical paradise, is hot and humid all round the year. Artificial forest is self-sustainable due to tropical rains.

Do not miss the live parade of birds as well as holding the parakeets in the hands.

Only negative point is that this attraction is far away from the heart of the city."
,,Veru good,4.0,,A little overcrowded but lots too see. Enclosures large enough. Bird show good. Needs better food options desperately. Bongo burger is a simple don't bother.
,,Shopping Mall With Food Outlets & Birds,2.0,,"This has become incredibly commercial in recent years. The monorail has gone and been replaced by a road train (1) with endless adverts in the recorded PA system.

There are shops and food outlets at every turn and where you can see the birds, with one exception, there's thick wire fencing to stop photography.

All in disappointing."
,,A great place for nature lovers,4.0,,"Jurong National park is the largest birds park in the world (In terms of number of birds) and the star attraction being the 1001 flamingos.. The park is located in a dense tropical forest and is a must when visiting Singapore.. Do walk around the park and avoid the buggies that ply.. this would ensure that you have a close view of the birds and also the scenic beauty of the park... The monorail which used to ply earlier inside the park has been decommissioned. There are 2 shows inside the park.. (Couldnt recollect the exact names)... 1. Kings of the sky- where we can get to see the high soaring birds like falcons, eagles, hawks etc.. and 2. A more entertaining show where we get to see various birds (parrots, flamingos, etc).. The timings of these shows are conveniently scheduled so that a visitor can experience both the shows... Also visit the enclosure where there are thousands of parrots.. The birds are inside an artistically designed enclosure and are very friendly.. (infact they were not scared at all and few of them started playing with us)..
Overall we had a great time and would recommend this place to everyone.. It would ideally take 1/2 day to visit this park.."
,,Nice place for kids.,5.0,,Great place to go with ur family. Great collection of exotic birds and a bird show worth watching. Feed birds inside their cage.
,,The Ornithological Wonder,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a great tourist attraction of Singapore. It is a landscape park with an area of 2,02,000 sq. Mtrs. [ 50 Acres] It was built on 3rd January 1971 at a cost of S$ 3.5 Million.

There are 5000 Birds of 400 species in this park. Currently this is the largest Bird Park in the
World in terms of number of birds.

The incredible part is that the birds imported from different parts of the World are maintained
very nicely to make them feel at home.

Here are few photographs of this park from my gallery just to justify my selected caption for this attraction."
,,Small but preety,5.0,,"1)to get there taxi is recommended.
2) be ready for extremly high humidity with NO winds
3) were disappointed by too narrow-meshed (not sure about the word - hope You guessed what I mean)))) cages. it's impossible to make good photos.
4) I could not make reservation by e-mail for guided tour (no reply for the request). when we asked after getting therre - they offerred us to have it 4 hours later - not applicable for us as we did not know what to do there so long time
5)highly recommended to visit the shows - it's worth to see it."
,,what you see on the website is what you see in live in his park.,4.0,,"- All kinds of birds.
- One bird show-- where in birds are well trained and their skills displayed.
- One man-made waterfall.
- For those who do not wish to walk thru the entire park, there is a tram ride.
I suggest taking the tram ride first to see what are the places in it to get an over all idea and then walk around with a map.
- Entrance fee details on their website.
-spend 2-3 hours and you can cover it entirely."
,,A Visit to Remember,5.0,,"This area of tropical rain forest is wonderfully maintained making it easy to walk or ride around. The bird collections are lovely, I do not like animal shows but you do not have to go to these to see the world's best collection of parrots and macaws.
The asian bird aviary is fascinating and many of the birds fly around you in settings of exotic flowers and trees.
Do not miss feeding the loris in a tree top walk, food is provided."
,,What an amazing place,5.0,,"We enjoyed the Jurong bird park, especially the live show with all the wonderful birds performing and showing us how talented they are. The garden with the exotic plants, orchids, frangipanis - many colours and other unusual plants. It was wonderful to be able to have your photo taken with the parrots. Great place to visit, but remember to take an umbrella or raincoat for the sudden downpour of rain.

,,Amazing day trip for young family,5.0,,"Enjoyed a fabulous day with our 2 boys (1.5 and 3). Hired a second stroller to make the most of the paths and transport options. Impressed by lots of information and great maps

Beautiful birds and like Singapore Zoo a strong conservation message. Beautiful setting

Started the day with one of the shows, which was fantastic.

Good food and gift options. As an expat Australian, loved sharing a lamington with my boys and having a coffee while watching birds. Feeding the birds was great.

Addition of a water park makes it an even better day out for families."
,,"Jurong Bird Park, a must to visit place in Singapore",5.0,,Our visit to Jurong Birds Park was memorable. The park had all species of birds. All well and neatly arranged in cages and open spaces. I think most of the birds in the world is there. The mono rail tour is excellent. The bird show is also worth to see. We forgot to buy the CD. Try to go early morning so that you can watch most of the birds. Artificial rain fall and world tallest artificial water fall are all wonderful attactions.
,,Hot Birds everywhere,5.0,,THis is a fantastic place for the family and kids. The lorrie enclosure at the top of the hill is by far the best experience. The staff know their stuff and are very helpful. I've been here more times than I care to mention and always smile.
,,Bird,5.0,,"The birds, the birds were like birds. They had feathers and beaks. I even saw a BIRD THERE! I love seeing birds. Birds in the Jurong BIRD park is SO nice. I even got to see WATER THERE! Fantastic"
,,Great for bird-lovers... so-so for everyone else,3.0,,"We visited the Night Safari and Singapore Zoo two years ago. Many friends told us that the Jurong Bird Park was great so we decided to check it out even if we aren't huge bird fans. It was very clean, organized, and constructed very well. What was nice about it was the lush greenery all around. If you are a bird lover, then you would love this place. But my daughter and I aren't really bird people (we don't dislike them, we're just not big fans) so it was just alright for us. We saw the usual birds that you can find in other zoos such as ostriches, penguins, eagles, etc. The highlight of our visit was feeding the lorakeets (bring small bills to pay the $3 for this). They were all over us and we even left with small scratches and pricks on our hands and arms. We finished the park in two hours. If I were to put in preferential order the three parks, number one would be the Singapore Zoo, followed by the Night Safari, and then the Jurong Bird Park comes in third place."
,,Red loris Yellow loris,4.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to the bird park. We found the walks with the keepers extremely useful as, otherwise you are inclined to just say, ooh there's another bird! The guides explained all about the dangers to them and the way they were being protected from extinction. We LOVED the loris, but DONT go in if you have a phobia about birds as they are flying everywhere and, if you buy the little pots of sugared water they are all over you - see the photo of our daughter in law! We enjoyed the birds of prey show too and seeing the superb starlings and feeding them was great. When you include this in the 3 pass ticket with the night safari and zoo it is incredible value."
,,feeding lories!,5.0,,"feeding the lory birds is the highlight of the trip! a world class bird park. awesome view, the man made waterfalls is breath taking. you shouldn't miss going to jurong bird park when you visit singapore."
,,One of the best bird parks in the world,5.0,,"This place takes great pride and care of their birds. They also offer wonderful hands on opportunities for you to really interact with the birds. I highly recommend the ""be a falconer"" tour if you like birds of prey - this for me was an once in the life time experience to get to see and touch all of these amazing creatures.

Overall, if you like birds, budget 2 days to make sure you hit all the major aviaries and tours / feedings / shows."
,,"A ""Top Ten Attraction"" When in Singapore! Don't Miss it!",5.0,,"While in Singapore we wanted to see the outskirts of the city so we took the North-South metro line which makes a loop around the island. This ended up being rather interesting to see that the whole island is just as well-organized and spotlessly clean as the central city. At Jurong we spent three hours visiting the Bird Park, for which you'll need to take a short shuttle bus ride from the main Jurong metro stop. What a fabulous park! We're not really into zoos, but this had such a grand scale with huge natural surroundings for the birds, it was truly magnificent. I've never seen so many colorful birds! One of the highlights is an area of multi-colored parrots where you can buy a cup of sugar water and the parrots come to you and sit ion your shoulder. An excellent photo opportunity! There were flamingos and toucans and other graceful birds in massive areas, not closed in. A very well organized park ... it should win a prize! We were rather tired in the heat so we took the loop skytrain which has three stops at key attractions. This was a lifesaver as the humidity (even in November) was quite high. We were glad to have visited this wonderful park and heartedly recommend it to others!"
,,Had a surprisingly good time and I am not even that fond of birds,5.0,,This is a great attraction that is very nicely set up. The park is beautiful and there is a lot of variety. Try to go early when it's less crowded and plan your time around the shows.
,,Lunch with Parrot show,3.0,,"We were at the second Panorail station but we rushed for the Parrot show and then realized at the entrance that we were only allowed in if we paid for the buffet which was $19++ per person. Then we walked back so we could have a longer ride on the air-conditioned Panorail. The lift wasn't working so we had to carry my sleeping baby on her stroller up the stairs only to find out the Panorail wasn't either! What??? Why did the ticket we bought say Panorail? And all their maps showed the Panorail!!! Couldn't they have indicated that it wasn't working??? Had to wake baby up and fold up stroller to get on tram. When we reached the 1st station, we wanted to go another round because we didn't start from the first station anyway but we were told to get down and queue again!

Tiring and horrible experience...."
,,my trip to the bird park,5.0,,"it's a great place as there are many different kinds of birds and the environment is very nice,. feel very relax and had a feeling of being in the nature."
,,Absolutely fantastic,5.0,,"Great attraction In Singapore .We took taxi from hotel to reach Jurong Park in morning and waited for the park to get open ..Why we reached so early ...reason was lorry loft.They are quite hungry in morning , so when you feed them , they come and sit all on your hands and head .....At that time not many people are around , so you get enough time to click photos with them all alone .You can catch up various shows also which are amazing and worth watching. Overall , its a must see if you visit Singapore ."
,,nothing much to see,3.0,,need a revamp throughout. looks more like and old abandon place. trams so squeezy and not close to showcase/animals for viewing.
,,Fantastic day out for the family,5.0,,"This is a great Singapore attraction. Great for all ages. Well laid out, very accessable via public transport. Lovely gardens, helpful staff. Fantastic live shows!"
,,Absolutely first rate!,5.0,,"As a family, we like our birds and this was a bit special.... in fact, there's really wasn't enough time to really experience it properly in one visit. From the static displays to the flying displays which included an owl and a very clever scarlet macaw, everything was wonderfully presented and the keepers were amazing; they obviously really love their birds, too!!
We can't recommend this highly enough!"
,,Needs Renovation and Improvement,3.0,,"To keep up with international tourism, Jurong Bird Park needs urgent refurbishing and improvements; such as the non-functional monorail which is an eye sore, coz the metal rails sticking all over the park are unpleasant sight; The bird show should consider includding penguins in their tricks like happy feet kind of performance? overall its better to visit Singapore Zoo that the Bird Park. Also better offer a free shuttle from Boon Lay MRT than charging visitors 4.5sgd for ther shuttle bus."
,,Great place to see lots of Birds,5.0,,This bird park was unlike any other Zoo. It is dedicated to birds and has some great exhibits. Some of the exhibits are a little small and it can be frustrating to try to take pictures as most of the birds are behind bars. However there are some very nice areas that are open and you don't feel like the birds are behind bars. My favorite was the very large Parakeets area where you can feed the birds and they come right up to eat from you.
,,Mixed feelings,4.0,,"We did this as a tour for the ease of being picked up & dropped off, but for anyone actually interested in birdlife we recommend abandoning the guide (who was very helpful) and making one's own way through the exhibits. The set time was far too rushed for us, so in hindsight maybe public transport would have worked better, especially as the return journey involved unannounced drop-offs which tripled the time we expected. Just as well we had nothing booked for the afternoon and were flexible !

Many of the birds which particularly interested us, such as toucans, macaws, hornbills and raptors were extremely difficult to spot when we couldn't hang about. There is a good variety of exotics which we don't see in Oz, so it was worth the visit."
,,I'm not a fan of birds - but this was a great place!,5.0,,I was happily surprised by the Jurong Brd Park: it is big and spacious and beautiful. The birds and the show was interesting. Transporation worked well. Make sure to bring bathing suits for kids because there is a water-play-ground there as well. We had a great day at the park. Make sure to visit the feeding cage!
,,"If you like birds, this is great",4.0,,A great place to see a huge variety of birds up close. There are various times when you can feed some of the birds - the kids loved this. There is also a great water playground for adults and kids to cool down in.
,,"The place to go with young kids, but bring a bathing suit!",5.0,,"The new ""Birds of Play"" mini-water park makes for a great mid-day stop at the Jurong Bird Park if you've got little ones. The Rube Goldberg inspired fountains are refreshing in the tropical climate, and the adjacent playground adds several more ways to tire the kids out. If you play it right, the adults can enjoy a stroll through the park while junior naps in the stroller."
,,Great park with constant improvements,5.0,,"This place is excellent, they are constantly improving t with small changes, recently they have added the water play area similar to the one in the Zoo, this makes for a fantastic day out, once the kids have seen the birds of paradise and gone to the lori-loft and they start to get bored, the water play is just the ticket. we bought a membership here and we use it regularly."
,,Doesn't really excite,3.0,,"If you have been to a few zoos, then there will be little new here. It is well laid out with all the standard collections, parrots, sea birds, raptors etc. A slightly humorous exhibit is the Singaporean take on an African jungle. The statues of Zulu warrior at the entrance was interesting. The waterfall Avery is so large/high that it is difficult to actually see the birds. The price is reasonable but the tram is probably not worth the money as it only has a couple of stops at the major points, the walking is not that hard. There are several food/ drink stops around the park. There seemed to be plenty of taxis for the return to trip to the city about $17"
,,A lovely day,5.0,,"A wonderful range of birds in beautiful settings replicating their native habitat. Allow enough time to stop and watch quietly - the birds will ignore you and you'll see them acting naturally. The shows for the kids were great fun, but adults will enjoy this too. We planned half a day here and spent all day."
,,A great array of birds,4.0,,"The array of bids on display is quite broad. The displays are well done, but some of the cages do prevent some photography. While we were there on a weekend, and the park was well patronised, you didnt feel that you were constantly tripping over people as you moved about. Try the monorail for a different view of the park. Walking about is easy, and there are places to eat available. Its a good day out for the family, or for couples or singles. The park is located way out west in Singapore and access, while not difficult, is not as straight forward as some places in Singapore."
,,What a bird park should be!,5.0,,"Very intimate, interactive with plenty of friendly birds (and not just the lorikeets!) to watch and watch!
We spent almost an entire day watching and photographing birds doing what they do normally.
So many people walked in and out, almost without stopping. They missed out on some of the friendliest birds, who just wandered up to us as we stood there, looked at us and went on their way."
,,"Good for kids, perfect for bird lovers!",5.0,,"Its located in the other side of Singapore so you will find a good escape
Green garden, very good managed and seems so natural!
They also have artificial waterfalls which is look like real one
Their birds collection are beautiful, lot of kinds and in good health
Some of birds are not in cage
Information about the birds and park map is really helpful
Penguins is one of their new attractions
You never regret to visit the place
The admission fee worth the experiences :)
PS : Free admission for anyone who visit the park on his/her birthday date!"
,,the animals of world in singapore,5.0,,a great collection of birds from all over the world birds n buddies show is one of its kind the staff is very courtious the variety they provide to the tourists is excellent it is so vast that one would see an owl and an exotic parrot too cleanliness and hygiene is taken great care of one day in the park could transport anyone to other world it is surely a must visit in singapore.......
,,Nice for kids,4.0,,Take the tram and drop by the lory park where you can feed the birds all day long.catch the 11 am show at the pools amphitrather.
,,Play with the Lories,5.0,,"If you are afraid of birds, stay out of the lorikeet cage. If you love parrots like I do you will love walking among hundreds of cheeky lorikeets who will perch on your hand or shoulder as long as you feed them--but watch out for the mess!"
,,Good access for disabled visitors,5.0,,"We visited jurong bird park. We took a taxi to entrance. I use a wheelchair, but there are buggies available to hire if you wish to leave wheelchair in car. You cannot put wheelchair on back of small hop on / hop off train which goes around the park. The small trailer is reserved for children's push chairs. This is a beautifully landscaped park . Stunning displays of orchids adorn the entrance. There are a few souvenir shops and quick service cafes. The aviaries where the birds fly freely are beautiful. There is a penguin enclosure, with lots of different penguins, but no king penguins. Children would find this very interesting. It is set on two levels so you would be able to see the birds diving for fish at feeding time.
Some of the inclines are a bit steep for the person pushing the chair. Excellent trip."
,,A great day out in a unique setting,4.0,,"Great for families with kids, this park is chock full of sights, activities and shows which far exceed the cost of you ticket. Wonderful for an introduction to conservation issues as well, as the Park is actively involved in breeding several endangered species in captivity. I'd suggest planning one's trip to catch at least one show, visiting the Lory aviary, and ending up at the splash pad/playground last."
,,Lovely Park!,5.0,,"this is a great day out, nice circular map so can do everything in a couple of hours. There is also a giant walk in bird cage with a waterfall which is great. The whole thing is a photographers paradise! By the 3 in 1 ticket with the zoo and night safari."
,,You have to show this to the kids!!,5.0,,The best part of Singapore is their love for kids and the Jurong bird park is the perfect place to show to kids. The bird show at the open air theater is very good. Followed by red flamingoes and african aviary and lory loft where you can get photos clicked while feeding colourful birds. Penguins are close to the entrance. But the best part is probably the kids pool where they have lots of water slides and showers etc. Total fun for the kids. It can get hot and humid there so carrying water and a personal fan maybe would be a good idea.
,,A Fun experience....,4.0,,"We visited Jurong Bird Park as we are quite a bird lover specifically the Macau's....
Jurong is a little way out of the city, but definitely worth the trip....We saw so many varieties of birds and that too in lush green environment.

There's a soothing splash of a waterfall amidst the park, surrounded with melodious chirping of birds..

One can opt for a monorail that can take you around the park, but would suggest walking around for a better view and feel of the bird park.

We also saw a Bird show and Penguin feeding sessions which were quite unique and enjoyable....overall a nice experience, specially for kids.

Cheers!!

RichAmit"
,,A great colourful day with the birds! Highlight of our trip to Singapore!,5.0,,"From all the attractions that we visited on our recent trip to Singapore, the Jurong Bird Park was by far the best and the most enjoyable!

The bird park is well maintained, and the birds looked robust and healthy! Both the shows - the Birds and Buddies and the King of the Skies were interesting and well put together. Infact, the King of the Skies show has been improvised to what we saw 5 years ago.

The highlight of the visit was the lory loft (do buy the feeding nectar at SGD 3, the pretty birds flock all over you!), the pelican feeding and the penguin feeding! All 3 were great experiences! The African Aviary was a bit of a let down...but the lory loft aviary more than made up for it! :) The bird learning center was well put-together and very informative. The owl section was positively eerie!

The bird-park is well spaced out yet small enough not to tire out little feet. My 9 year old really enjoyed himself and though we were one of the first to enter at 9 am, we had to rush ourselves to leave at 3ish; we could have easily spent another 2 hours at the bird park just looking at those beautiful birds!

Access was easy - the bus interchange outside Boon Han has buses coming in every 20 minutes and its a short bus ride to the bird park. We got a cab easily when we left the bird park early evening.

It was a great day spent, full of colours and beautiful memories! :)"
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"Recently visited with our two daughters, aged 6 & 8. They really enjoyed the park, especially the Lorry Loft and the water play area (so make sure you take your swimwear!). Even the food wasn't too expensive in places ($3 for a bottle of coke and $3 for two sandwiches).

It is quite hilly, meaning that the girls got tired before we saw all of the park, but that didn't actually matter, as they still loved it. We caught the train from Clarke Quay to Boon Lay station (about $12 for the 4 of us) and then caught a bus ($6 for 4 of us) to the Park."
,,One of the best Bird Parks anywhere,5.0,,The variety of birds in a great environment (where some of them fly/roam free in large walkthough aviaries) makes going to the Bird Park a joy. There is easy access to all the exhibits so that anyone of any age can enjoy the spectacle.
,,Entertaining and relaxing,5.0,,"I really don't like ZOOs but this park is something different. I loved the lorry birds area where you can feed them with nectar :) The park is well maintained and modern, with many facilities like shops, toilets and places to rest. There are also bird shows for those who like this kind of attractions. The one thing I didn't like was the penguin aquarium - I'm no expert but I felt like those funny creatures would like to spend some time in an open-air area, not only in a tank with artificial light (yeah, I know it's too hot for them in Singapore, but...). All in all, the park is a great place for families with children or for anybody else who wants to spend some hours away from the big city hubbub."
,,Great in rain or sunshine,5.0,,"We arrived at the Bird Park about 40 minutes before a torrential downpour that lasted for about two hours. In the time before the rain and thunder, we saw lots of flamingos, storks and shoebills; when it began to rain we skulked inside the songbird aviary for three quarters of an hour, before realising this wasn't going to be just a passing shower.

At that point, I considered going home, but since plastic ponchos can be purchased easily from the shop near the entrance, and because there are actually covered walkways across most of the park, we didn't have to get soaked and could continue exploring. If you can brave the rain, it may actually be better to go during inclement weather, as there weren't crowds of people blocking us at any point (we saw about twenty people after the storm began, excluding everyone sheltering near the entrance). Your feet will still get damp from the water running across the ground, but your head should stay dry most of the time. Further, if it's not sunny then you won't feel like you're melting under the unkind gaze of the sun.

High points of a visit here would be the lories (very tame budgriegar sized birds that will sit on you and eat from proffered tubs), the wide range of toucans and hornbills, and of course the pelicans, which as ever are creatures that look both ridiculous and self-important. Like royals from a minor European country, I suppose, but without the deference.

There's also emus, rheas and some cassowaries, all of which are less than beautiful but well worth looking at. We didn't bother with the monorail or the tram around the park as we preferred to walk at our own pace, but these would probably be better if you're weighed down with children or other paraphernalia."
,,A Lot of Birds,4.0,,"The area is so big, like a giant aviary. I enjoyed learning and knowing more about the bird species. Even if there is a monorail, I would rather walk, because you cannot linger while in the train. At the lorry loft, birds would perch on you. It even has a children's playground."
,,Great Uncomparable Bird Park,5.0,,"Actually this was my second visit to Jurong Bird Park (JRB).

What is really amazing about JRB that they are always improving everything.
Nothing is monotone, everything is updating to the visitors' need.
Everything is well maintained, clean and kept well.

The attractions and the scenery make us forget that we are in Singapore (except the humidity). they set the landscape according to the area (africa, tropical etc) very well.

The cages are maintained very well and the birds are very well trained and make them very tame to all the visitors.

But it is quite tiring for the young children since they don't allow us to bring in the strollers for the kids, it is understandable since they have the tram and monorail for hire.

It is quite shame, that they also don't have any choices of restaurants for dining there.

However, it doesn't minimize the quality of service and staffs of the JRB, which are very professionals.

The facilities for the visitors are very well maintained, toilets almost everywhere, souvenirs shops in some areas. and the new thing that makes our children very very excited it the Birds to Play facilities.

It is a free of charge facilities that they can enjoy the splashing area with slides, and watering fountains, guns and giant bucket. It is a smart idea for the park in singapore where the air is very hot and humid.

The shows and attractions are very attractive and very much concern to environment.

The collections of birds are magnificent. the keep breeding many rare birds from all around the world in a very comfy conditions for the birds.

This place is worth visiting either for relaxing, education and learning facilities.

Two thumbs up for Singapore and its Jurong bird Park."
,,Wonderful!,5.0,,Best bird park I've ever seen. Someone told me it was the largest in the world. Great picture-taking opportunities if you are patient and have a decent camera. Some very exotic birds.
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"We visited Jurong Bird Park on a whim on our last day in Singapore and I'm so glad we did. Jurong is a little way out of the city, but definitely worth the trip. There is a monorail that can take you around or you can walk. I'd recommend walking so you can get a better view of the amazing birds."
,,Like being a Pirate. Without the patch. Or the wooden leg.,4.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park was at times a very over the top tourist trap, and yet a fantastic experience when it came to getting close to some of the worlds most exotic birds.

There was a mix of aviaries and enclosures for the birds. Some where spacious and tropical paradise-like habitates, and some seemed just sad. The jungle aviary had a large spilling waterfall and countless birds hiding in the trees, where as the owl display seemed pathetically small for such majestic creatures (especially when small children were banging their fists on the glass)

Facilities: There were lots of washrooms available, as well as ample vendors selling drinks and light snacks.

The Location - it was not too far out from the city centre. You can get there by the metro+bus, which is handy.

The Food - There are a few cafes/restaurants to choose from, but bringing some small snacks and water would probably do you well, as there was a price hike.

Fitness Level- Easy peasy! There was a fair bit of walking, but you could also catch a sky tram if you paid a little extra.

What to Make Sure You Do: Lorry Aviary - if you do go, pay the extra $5 to have unlimited nectar at the Lorries cage. It was amazing! There is an adventure canopy that you tour around (hanging bridges between trees) and they give you a small cup with nectar in it and all of the sudden you are covered in the most spectacularly coloured birds. They climb on your shoulders and head and hands to take a few sips of the nectar. It was an amazing experience, and the birds were just beautiful (and friendly! No biting!)

What to Avoid: The harpy photographers! For a mere $40 you can have a picture with....get this....a bird! Seriously though, they are obviously trying to squeeze as much as they can out of tourists, and it is not worth it in the slightest. Bring your own camera and save the money.

Overall impression - I am glad we went, it was a great to see such amazing birds in a reasonably well looked after habitat."
,,Water Park is a highlight!,4.0,,"Of all the “animal” attractions in Singapore (i.e. Jurong Bird Park, Singapore Zoo & Night Safari), this is my kids favorite. The movie “Rio” has only confirmed its position on the #1 spot!

In particular, the water park area inside the park is fantastic… we will often spend an entire morning just hanging out in the water park. I have three boys aged seven, six and two… my two-year-old can’t swim but all of them LOVE the water park… it’s very safe and loads of fun with three mini water slides and a huge water dump area.

Ben & Jerry’s is right beside the water park, and do fantastic mocha’s for the parents :)

Some of the bird enclosures are a little sad (too small), but the majority are pretty good. The waterfall enclosure is great, and some of the tropical birds are too colourful to imagine."
,,Lory feeding really great fun,5.0,,Nice day out at the bird park. Unlimited lory feeding - keep your cup for them to refil for you each time. Could do that all day! Birds of prey show is also great and first show is at 10 a.m.so be there early (there is another one much later in the day). Well worth a visit.
,,Birds are COOL,5.0,,So much packed into such a small space. Fantastic. Lory Loft! Kids' playground! Walk-in Aviary! Proud to be Singaporean.
,,They have the flamingos here!,4.0,,"The park keeps a lot of this rare and attractive birds in the area. Another funny part is watching the colorful parrots lined up on a single branch and did silly things. However these birds are actually very smart. The park also organises bird shows which are very interactive and exciting. The staff, especially the bird trainers are very nice and friendly."
,,Day long trip - must go prepared!,4.0,,"Beautiful park but oh so big! It will definitely take an entire day so make sure to get a bright n early start. If you're travelling with young children, I cannot stress the importance of strollers! Although, they do have plenty of them on rent.. the ease of having your own where you can stash everything is something else! Even kids who are slightly older and walk all the time will get tired n dehydrated due to the heat. Kudos to the management at the park for making it as comfortable as possible though. Plenty of resting and refreshment spots and not to mention the monorail that goes round the entire park so that you can see what you desire quickly without walking round the whole park (an impossible feat with toddlers!)"
,,Must visit for bird lovers.,5.0,,"This place is huge with lots of birds. If you are a bird person this place must be close to heaven. Its issue is it is quite hilly and with with Singapore's hot/humid weather, it can be quite tiring after walking its 50 acres."
,,A must sigthseeing,5.0,,A must is seeing a show while you're there. Especially as a tourist it is fun. We loved the birdpark because it is full of life and inhabits of bird. I remember walking around the park with my head in my neck: just looking to the sky above with all the bird! We was picked out of a crowd because I was white and blonde and I particited in the show a parrot fly through a hoop.
,,A lovely place to spend a morning,5.0,,"Amazing array of colourful birds at this exceptional park which is family friendly with plenty of rest stops, restaurants, and easy tram rides. "
,,Good to do if you have already done everything else in SIngapore,3.0,,"There are some very nice aspects about this part and then equally bad parts. Costs around $20 depending on what add ons you get for admission. I felt this was a very responsible fee as the park is small and just has birds. The Lory Loft was amazing, our kids loved feeding the birds and it was an amazing experience. The mini water part was also a lot of fun. The park isn't that busy so it is a good place to go where you do not have the typical singapore crowds. The negative aspects of the park are the living conditions of some of the other birds. While the Lorys have it made with their huge living area, a lot of large birds (eagles, owls, etc) are in small, dated caged areas. This aspect alone ruined my experience."
,,Feathered exhibits,4.0,,"It complements the zoo and often overshadowed by it. Again just like the zoo, lush tropical surrounds make it a worthwhile visit."
,,a lovely attraction to visit whilst in singapore,4.0,,"I visited with my friend , her 12 yo daughter and her mother whilst they were in Singapore. All of us thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. There were so many interesting birds, many I had never heard of. I would recommend bringing snacks, so you dont have to queue to buy food. The grounds are very large so wear comfortable walking shoes and also mosquito spray. We brought lots of water to prevent dehydration as most of the displays are outdoors. Overall a very enjoyable experience"
,,The best of it's kind,5.0,,We visited singapore in july 2008.And my kids really enjoyed this place.We can't imagine varieties of birds more than this.And the bird show was simply mind blowing.A palce definitely not to be missed for all age groups.
,,it is small but complete,4.0,,revisited the park a mth ago and found that it was totally different. it was so boring and limited back then and the management really put in effort to rejuvenate the park. It is now a vibrant and visit-worthy venue. I will definitely recommend it to my friends and relatives to go.
,,Great for birds - expensive for ice-cream,5.0,,"If you like birds and penguins, Jurong Bird Park is worthwhile. Bus from Boon Lay MRT will take you there or walk the approx. 2 km through industrial areas. You can cycle from town like I did and its a pleasant ride on a good day. During the week plenty of room in the park, gets crowded over weekends. Easy to walk the circle which takes you to all the different themes of birds. Shows and feeding displays - good. I fancy cockatoos and their avery is full of small and large sulphur crested ones. The lay out of the park is thoughtful. Helpful well trained staff everywhere. Two scoops of Ben & Jerry strawberry ice-cream in a cone cost SGD 10.00, the worlds most ice-cream I have come across. Tasted good though, but any ice-cream would have on this last of many visits on a blue sky with a burning, scorching sun."
,,"Some good displays, some a bit uninteresting",3.0,,"Like the zoo I think this park's commercial focus is undermining its reason for being. There seems to be an increasing focus on selling and less focus on the birds and their conservation. However, the bird show was an exception to this rule and is recommended. Some of the displays (the hornbills and lorikeets) were less interesting but the flamingos and pelicans were very nice, as were the penguins. Another hot outdoor experience so I recommend getting there as early as possible. The African waterfall aviary was underwhelming. Food and beverages are ridiculously priced."
,,Plenty to see for all ages,5.0,,A full day needed to get to see and do everything. The park is well signposted so you can easily get round to all the different areas. Also plenty of shows and feeding times to watch. The panorail ride is a good way to get around if the walking is a bit strenuous. Our favourite part was the penguin area where we could have spent hours just watching the penguins antics. Well worth a visit. A good idea to get tickets for the other animal attractions and save money.
,,Faded - 30 years ago was a front runner - not now,4.0,,"Needs the cash collected to be re-invested in the birds and please re-do the cages - surely we are in hi tech now. Not good enough any more, sorry. Was world leader 30 years ago."
,,Great attraction - a must-see,5.0,,"Top Tips:
1. Go early in the morning. It opens at 830am.
2. BUY the pass for the panorail, which is an elevated rail that goes above the park and gives you a great birds-eye view. The extra $$5 is worth it.
3. The panorail pass does not give you unlimited rides. It limits each person to getting on once per station (there are 3), so plan which stations you wish to get on at.
4. To minimize queuing time for the panorail, don't get on the main station at the entrance where everyone is queuing. Since legs are fresh upon entry, walk from the main entrance, turning left on the path, enjoying the scenery and birds, and get on the second station (Lory Station), after you visit the Lory Loft. much shorter or no queues that way.
5. Bring fans, the small hand-held ones are a life saver in the heat.
6. Don't miss the Bird Show. Good fun.
7. For visitors to Singapore, consider taking a taxi from the MRT station (or even from your hotel).
8, There are 4 aviaries, which are really fun, as it's much nicer to see the birds in a free environment, rather than in cages. (except for the predators. the eagles/vultures are scary)
9. The Penguins and Owls exhibits are worth the entrance S$18 fee. Plus, they are both air-conditioned and offer a respite from the heat.
9. If your time is very limited (or if you have a tired toddler as I did), then my suggested short visit itinerary is: the Lory Loft, the flamingo pond, the Owls, the Bird Show, and finish at the Penguin Coast, which is near the entrance.

A must-see for visitors to Singapore or with kids. (This seems wrongly classified as a ""Jurong"" attraction when it should be a ""Singapore"" attraction)"
,,Lots of birds!,5.0,,"One of my favourite places - I have been there twice already. I know kids love it, makes for some great pictures. I love the penguins, parakeets and the flamingoes."
,,An Excellent Park Dont Miss It,5.0,,"Biggest tip - Spend the money and get the monorail pass included. It is very hot and humid. We are used to the tropics and even we struggled.

The bird show is a great watch so catch it if you can. The exhibits are fun and full of birds. You feel very close to them with out actually touching them. Children will love this place and when we were here a massive childrens area complete with water play was being built.

Definitely a must see if you like birds and have kids."
,,Great Park,4.0,,Love the Lory Loft and new kids' zone. Lots of beautiful birds and kids enjoy the shows! Bring your insect repellent!
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"If you like birds then have a trip here, see a couple of shows and feed the Lorikeets. Gets very hot though"
,,Fantastic - much better than we thought it would be,5.0,,This park is well set out and has beautiful gardens. The man made waterfall and surrounds are beautiful. We really enjoyed the park and would definitely recommend it to others.
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is located at the west end of Singapore, which is far from where we stay- It took us about 1hr 15 mins to reach Boon Lay Station and transfer to Bus no. 194 or 251 at the Bus Interchange. Once you reach the Bird Park, you realise the long journey was worth it! You may need atleast half a day to enjoy the Shows & Attractions at the park, so do plan accordingly.

At the Bird Park, you can avoid the panorail since the park isn't that big, and can be covered by foot.

I particularly liked the Birds N buddies Show where the birds fly and soars right above our heads! The Lory Loft was also a lovely experience. It is a walk-in flight aviary with lots and lots of free-flying lories. We can purchase a cup of special nectar mix (SG$3) and feed the birds who flock right on our shoulders & arms to feed on the mixture.

The Bird Park also offers other chit-chatting & feeding the birds sessions for which you can check the timings on their official website or at the entrance gate and may schedule your trail accordingly. The staff is friendly & helpful.

The restaurants and cafes are decently priced for a tourist attraction. Both the cafes at the entrance offer Vegetarian food options also."
,,Bird park in the morning,3.0,,"We visited this bird park in the morning. There was hardly any crowd when we got there since we were one of the first ones to enter the park that day.

We managed to take the panorail to a few stops but later it got too crowded and we walked instead. I would suggest you carry some drinks with you because if you choose to walk, it could get a little tiring.

The Lory Loft was a treat to the eyes with colourful birds. You can also feed them."
,,Must visit,4.0,,"Fascinating , worth a visit - better than the 'smelly' over hyped night safari."
,,See the largest Man-made Waterfall,5.0,,"In a far-off corner of the West, an interesting place to visit, especially for students."
,,Worth a Visit,3.0,,"Had been to Jurong this December and was fun, although the place is a little far from the main city, 45 min on MRT and then another 30-4- minutes in Bus (waiting for the Bus). If you are a bird lover, this place is worth a visit. The feeding of the birds is fun. Avoid the monorail as it makes you miss a lot of sections and you have to walk all the way back to visit the bird sections. In short worth a visit if you have time during your visit to Singapore."
,,Very relaxing day out,5.0,,Beautiful birds - enjoy the Lori aviary where birds land on you and eat from your hand.
,,"Fantastic experience, well worth the cost",5.0,,"Imagine holding birds of prey on your arm. An incredible 45 mins being instructed in the history of this ancient sport of royalty and nobility, and the management of hawks, owls and eagles. Having a 2Kg eagle landing on my arm was truly amazing. At approx AUD$75 it wasn't cheap but well worth it and you do get professional photo, magnet, key ring and special gift included. Need to book as limited vacancies each day. Take your camera as even though you get a photo taken you can take your own as well. The 3 staff members conducting the program were very friendly and obliging."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"A long but easy journey out on the MRT, but don't get off at Jurong East, go to Boon Lay Station and transfer to Bus no. 194 or 251 at the Bus Interchange. Worth the effort though to see magnificent and colourful birds. As reported elsewhere some cages may be small, but these are a small minority as most birds are ether in very large landscaped enclosures or huge aviaries flying freely. You can get very close to the birds as you walk inside and along the paths through the aviaries and around this large landscaped park."
,,I like this park better than the singapore zoo,4.0,,"Take the map at the airport or visitor centre at the city , there's a 3 DOLLARS OFF ENTRANCE FEE when you flashed the map and showed the ticketing office your passports. Offer valid until 31st jan 2012.
Took the mrt to boon lay and boarded the bus to the park. The ride was swift.
Bought the admission + rail tickets -- it was worth it , you'll be too tired if you went on foot around the entire park.
I like this park better than the zoo because it was less crowded, it was more lush with beautiful birds and trees. It's of a good size. We completed the park within 3 hours. There are playground for children and ice cream parlour for the parents. It was very relaxing and less tiring for us.

No problem with the taxi ride back home. There were taxis available. alternatively, you can always board the bus to boon lay mrt station."
,,Week activity filled in Singapore!,4.0,,"I've been to Singapore several times but had an opportunity to visit Jurong Bird Park only recently. It's accessible by Metro Train, by bus and shuttle via tour operated coach. Upon entrance, you will be greeted by beautiful orchids and colorful birds. These can only be seen oftentimes thru books, paintings and toys. This place is heaven for orchids and birds lovers!! Truly amazing! They also feature shows at different times of the day. Be sure to bring an umbrella or raincoats / jacket in case it showers. You will be able to get around it thru their operated tram (if you purchase a ticket entrance with tram ride and I suggest you do) or do a walking tour. The map provides different points of interests and it depends on where you want to spend more time. Make sure you come early as it normally drizzle in the afternoon. Looking at the multi colored birds and the beautiful orchids will energize you and make you want to see more. Bring bottled water in case you need to take a sip to refresh you in the warm tropical climate. There is a food court near the souvenir shop in case you feel hungry."
,,No better place to see the birds!,4.0,,"This was my second visit to the Jurong Bird Park, the first being nearly a decade earlier. I particularly enjoy seeing birds with beautiful plumage, as well as those I've never seen before; the JBP has them all. It's nicely done. As such, it's very popular and one is best advised to get there early to mitigate crowding.

Having been to zoos around the world, the Jurong Bird Park is probably one of the best places to view birds."
,,Let the birds out!,1.0,,"Smelly, dirty, small cages for beautiful birds. Very sad to see unhappy Galahs (but pleased to see someone get bitten by one of them who was being teased). Extremely busy in holiday times."
,,I love this place!,5.0,,It is a small park. We managed to catch all the shows which was really cool. There is also a new water playground for the kids. My favorite part is whereby we get to feed the birds in a big cage-like place. So you pay $ 2 to get the food/liquid form in a cup and the birds will flock to you. Be sure to bring lots of drinks and some snacks if you have kids with you. We always have great fun at this park.
,,Good for kids!,4.0,,Beautiful location and good programs. Interesting things like bird feeding and shows. Informative and fun for kids. Cute train ride if you get tired of walking.
,,Great bird shows,5.0,,Try to make a point to get there and see the great shows that occure at fixed times just in side the main entrance. They are worth seeing and the birds fly just over the audience.
,,An experience not to be missed,5.0,,"A must go experience.. Just buy in the park hopper ticket to get access to all 3 parks. We went there in the morning and planned it as such to reach there around 9 am. Thus we were able to see the birds of prey show at 10 :00 am and the parrots show at 11 am. Both were awesome and should not be missed. They have got everything in them to entertain adults as well as kids.
Overall the bird park was something I had never experienced before. We were completely amazed and fascinated by the kinds of birds kept in their. The habitat is very natural and awe inspiring. The park is beautifully built and very natural.
We loved the bird park specially the African waterfall aviary. It was very natural, relaxing soothing. The observation decks were like walking in a dense forest and watching birds. I found for the first time that watching birds can be so relaxing and peaceful."
,,Utterly fascinating to say the least !,5.0,,"I have now visited JBP thrice since my very first visit there in August,2006. I invariably feel torn ... between ... going there alone (with my photographic assistants of course) or going there with the Singapore-based part of my family (especially the kids). And, that literally spells how well-conceived and thoughtfully done the entire concept of JBP indeed is. Toddlers & kids enjoy it as much as do adults and seniors.

Of course a review at TA is no place to begin describing in detail the features of JBP, but the authorities must be congratulated for creating an attraction so thoughtfully and with such universal appeal. If I have a choice amongst JBP, Singapre Night Safari, Zoo and the Insect Kingdom at Sentosa amongst the natural history hotspots of Singapore ... I will repeatedly choose JBP till I have totally satisfied my photographic instinct. The ABSOLUTELY AMAZING bird shows at JBP deserve at least 10 stars literally and figuratively ! I have no doubt that these grand shows endear birds to all far more than mere books and 2D bird clips on TV ! Indeed once-in-a-lifetime experience !! And, I already had THREE.

Thank you JBP, it was indeed always wonderful to visit you. If only I could rent a room close to JBP, I would rent it for months !!"
,,Arguably Best in The World,5.0,,"Having been to various bird parks around the world, this is definitely world class. Many of the birds are not caged or in an aviary, which leave you wondering why the birds don't fly away. Well, some do. But they always come back as it is an oasis for them. You'll need at least 1 whole day starting at 9am to 6pm in the evening to fully enjoy what this park has to offer. And for entry price of S$18, it is a steal. I do recommend renting a scooter, if you are like me, tire easily and prefer a little pampering. Don't miss the shows, feeding times and the tree top walk at Lory Loft."
,,Best Bird Park in the World??,5.0,,A riot of colour and variety in a wonderfully well planned enviorenment. A must see for children and even adults with a love for wildlife
,,Jurong Bird Heaven,5.0,,"We went together with my sister's family (visiting from India), to the Jurong Bird Park in Singapore on the morning of 12th Nov, 2011. I call this park affectionately as Jurong Bird Heaven!! Indeed one gets elevated easily to such ecstasy in a haven of lovely birds in the midst of an enchanting rainforest setting. We are visiting the Park after a long gap of 8 yrs and so many new attractions have been added. Do not miss the Kings of the Skies and the Birds n Buddies Shows - awesome live show with a variety of birds - Owls, Eagles, Parrots, Falcons, etc. And, the Panorail trip across the park with stopovers at stations where you can walk around the rainforest and hop back when tired. Be in time for the Penguin feeding at 2 PM, big birds fight to catch the flying fish!! The African aviary with a huge waterfall is a good resting place together with the musical birds!! The World of darkness and Penguin coast are a must see! In total a consummate experience to be relished for a long time, waiting to go again this December with another family visiting us this December!!"
,,Birds and Orchids,5.0,,"This isn't a huge zoo, but has many varities of birds that you don't normally see. The entrance goes through some long branches and bridges covered with Orchids. You get lost in the Orchids and have to be reminded of the birds. Several walkthrough cages get you close to this colorful nature. One walkthrough allows you to feed the birds, and as you can imagine - they are agressive and friendly. A good combination is to see this zoo during the day then head over to the Night Safari."
,,Best Bird Park,4.0,,Go in the morning. Carry an umbrella. Avoid food at reastaurent (Not much for vegetarians) Work out a schedual to enjoy evey show. All the shows are amazing. Dont take a tram.. walk insted. Wll maintained and wonderful feeling jst being surrounded by beautiful birds
,,Superb attraction well worth a visit,5.0,,A fantastic place to visit. The range of birds on display is great and they are in walk through aviaries. Most birds are outside some are in cages (like birds of prey). All in all a good day out. There is also a monorail for those who don't want to walk round.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"A great day out, my 6 year old enjoyed it very much, especially feeding the birds"
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park combines Singaporean efficiency with a marvellous collection of birds in a wonderfully verdant setting. It is a 'must visit' park for young and old alike, for both the ornithologist and the general visitor. The sheer variety of birds one can see and the way in which they are looked after is indeed amazing. The icing on the cake is the special bird show. One has to see it to fully appreciate it. One cannot but strongly recommend at least a half day visit to this bird park while in Singapore."
,,Ageing Tourist Attraction for Tourists of All Ages!!!,3.0,,"Jurong Bird Park, an ageing tourist attraction of Singapore, as it is called in guidebooks, keeps changing and improving itself for a better visitor experience. It is now well connected by MRT and bus and one of the must-see attractions on a tourist visit to Singapore. However, at the end of the day, though, well-maintained or well-intentioned, this is a zoo and the visitor has to be prepared to see caged birds, though many of the birds inside are fully free or inside large enclosures (aviaries). Jurong Bird Park is worth a whole day’s visit as it is large and there is much to see. It has its own onsite restaurants so one can tuck into lunch during a break in the visit. Though visitors get a map of the park with directions, the large size of the park and the peculiar layout of the displays means one has to carefully study the map and correlate it with the displays and ensure that one goes round the park either clockwise or anticlockwise and does not miss out on any of the displays. The park has added a Panorail (monorail like) option and a buggy ride (golf cart type) for those (most visitors will fall in this category) finding the walk around tiring in the tropical heat! Of course, both options come for an additional price! Visitors should carry plenty of drinking water whether on foot or rail or buggy, as one needs to keep oneself hydrated for the many hours needed to see the bird park. The main attraction of Jurong Bird Park continue to be birds but one should be prepared to return without having seen many of the thousands of birds of hundreds of species claimed to be on display! Birds, even though they may be caged may not all be visible during visit hours. The park has added feeding of the birds as a visitor activity and one has to pay for and buy additional tickets to participate in such activity. All walk-in aviaries claim to have many species and large number of birds but it is difficult to get a view of all birds which may be at a height or camouflaged. The African Waterfall Aviary is a disappointment though touted to have the highest artificial waterfall in the world. Very few of the birds at the African Aviary are visible in the dense foliage and those that are either ones attracted to the feeding stations or other common birds such as mynahs, doves and sparrows! Though the authorities have tried to evoke African atmosphere with displays of articles related to life in that continent, at the entrance, the actual experience is likely far different from natural environs in Africa. Experience at the two other aviaries – one on tropical birds and ther other on Lories is no different. The Bird Discovery Centre is a nice addition and is place worth spending hotter part of the day in, as it is air-conditioned! It has good information on bird eggs and feathers and other information about birds. The Birds of Prey and two others adjoining it – Hornbills and Toucans and Birds of Paradise are huge disappointments. It is a pity to see magnificent birds of prey caged, used as they are, to soaring in the sky. Hornbills, toucans and birds of paradise too are all caged and barely visible to the visitors! World of Darkness has owls and has its own problems as the condensation on the glass prevents the owls inside from being seen. The bird park actually is a great green space in the city and actually has lesser highlighted attractions, that are as good as the main attraction – birds. Visitors should keep an eye out for and spend time on the great display of Orchids right at the entrance! Singapore’s weather is highly conducive to growing orchids and the sheer number and variety of them on display right at the entrance is worth spending atleast half an hour. The park is also host to a conservatory of Heliconias (a type of plant including one named Bird of Paradise) which adjoin the display of Shore Birds."
,,Nice morning out,4.0,,"Took 2 young kids, nice morning out, good monorail, penguin part & beautiful flamingos"
,,A great outing,5.0,,We enjoyed our trip to the Jurong Bird Park. We ended up catching a taxi from Marina Bay which didn't take long and was around SGD15 each way. We spent 2.5 hours at the park and enjoyed seeing the birds. Some birds are in cages but the majority are in huge enclosures or free in the park. They have a great variety. The monorail goes around the park but is good to get to the highest part of the park so you can walk downwards. There are plenty of outlets for food and drinks as well. Bathroom facilities were also very clean.
,,"Trust me, you will like it",5.0,,"If you think Universal Studios was good,you will find this even better.They are not related but still.Kids studying may want to see vultures,king eagles etc and like to have birds sitting on their arms and get photos clicked.Jurong Bird Park is nothing but huge bird park with a few aviaries.It has the African Waterfall Aviary which has the tallest man-made waterfall in the world.I will give you a link to a video which I shot there with my cam.There is a show where the tell you a lot about pelicans and ask you questions about them at the end.If you answer correctly you get to feed pelicans at the end."
,,World class attraction!,5.0,,"Neither my husband nor I are crazy bird chasing aficionados but the Jurong Bird Park in Singapore has so much going on it has some appeal for everyone. We saw penguins, toucans, falcons, pink flamingos, black swans, birds that looked too beautiful to be real, birds that looked too strange to be real, hundreds more, and one huge man made waterfall all in the most beautiful garden setting. We truly enjoyed this attraction so much. We were not overly impressed by the available food, one of the restaurants was closed leaving little choice for our lunch. Other that that all I can say is we had an amazing and fascinating day at this bird park."
,,Can wlak around whole day,5.0,,"What a nice place to stay with nature. If you are tired, you can avail the car. But walking is the best choice. You can buy some food for birds and they will seat on your arm---that's a nice experience."
,,"If you're into birds, this is the place to visit",4.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is an old stalwart of the Singapore tourist scene, but somehow remains fresh and interesting (if you're a bird geek that is). The large aviary in the centre of the park, containing the parrots is the highlight; if you buy a small container of syrup, the birds will literally eat out of your hand. Note that those afraid of birds landing on them will find this confronting, as you can literally be covered by hordes of the squawking little buggers, however if you're a bird lover it's a must-visit.
Visit the bird show in the restaurant and try to work out if the bird is actually singing the Singapore national anthem or whether the handler is a very good ventriloquist.... I couldn't actually work it out when I was there!"
,,You can fall in love with Birds here............,5.0,,"Beautiful Park and amazing place to be.........a 4 hrs tour minimum. Reastaurant are also there...........you can even carry food with you. There is Worlds highest Manmade waterfall here, other than birds.......there are shows also done by bird trainers."
,,AN UNPRECEDENTED TOURIST ATTRACTION.,5.0,,"I took my wife on a Holiday to Singapore in August'2011 and having gone to the island nation, it would not have been wise to miss the Jurong Bird Park.And we put it on our itinerary.The visit to Jurong Bird Zoo was not only memorable but thrilling.It is unbelievable that some more than 4500 birds of about 300 odd species are kept in their natural environ.Penguins,Pelicans,Eagles,Hornbills et al attract thousands of visitors daily from around the world.We enjoyed the Panorail ride,the walk on the lorryloft and the Birdshow and the Eagles' show.Given a chance, I want to visit the place again.The place has excellent facilities like Gift shop,ice cream parlour and wash rooms etc.

I recommend this place to all tourists to Singapore.Rather a visit to Singapore without visiting Jurong Bird Park would be incomplete."
,,stumulating and fun,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the park. The owl, parrot, and lorie exhibits are well put together. A very nice selection of species with nice descriptions."
,,hand feeding lorries is the best,5.0,,"we have visited the bird park a couple of times recently - it is just amazing - the children ( aged 6 and 9), love it - it is not too big and you can easily get round in a day. Our favorite bit is the lorrie loft where you can hand feed lorrikeets in a 9 story high free flight aviary - it is truely magical. We also timed it right at the waterfall aviary on our last visit so also got to hand feed the african starlings. The shows are worth seeing - not too long for short attentio spans, and with an environmental message. They are building a childrens play area which looks like it will be open soon, which will make it evne better!"
,,EXCELLENT!!!!!!,5.0,,"We visited Singapore early this month. there we went to this Jurong Bird Park, which is the largest bird park in the world..it was fantastic... we spent almost about 4-5 hours there and enjoyed every second of our time....so many birds to see and capture..!!! i just marvelled at the God's lovely creations...so many of them, with all those amazing shapes and colors and no repetition of a single pattern of the color combination...

The ""main attractions and a definitely not to miss"" things were the various bird shows. They have about 5-6 of them and the best ones were the birds and buddies and the birds of prey show...!!!! the birds fly to the centre stage from every corner of the ampitheatre, right over ur head and past ur shoulder.. one needs to be careful and should not stand during the show as this may cause accidents..

Feeding some of the birds is another lovely experience, especially the Lorries at the loft...they just sit every where on u to get a chance with the food in ur hand...

Another amazing section was the african aviary and its waterfall..sheer wonderfull !!!!

There are food areas inside and washrooms which are very clean...we just thanked God that it didint rain that day, ,otherwise we wuldnt have enjoyed the way we did. They usually cancel the shows wen it rains...

This palce is a must visit attraction and u wuldnt regret it a bit....!!!!"
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,I was told that this is the best bird park in the world by a bird lover & he's probably not wrong. The set up is beautiful with the display set amongst trees & water ways. The collection of birds is impressive & the shows that are put on each day are entertaining & informative. The new penquin display is verg good with plenty of birds to see. The only area that probably needs some work is for the birds of prey with their enclosures beind on the smaller size for birds of that size. In all a great days entertainment.
,,worth flying half way around the world to see,5.0,,"If you love birds THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE. I arrived with my partner around 1:30 pm on a Friday. Our plan was the bird park followed by the Night time Safari at the Zoo.

If you are coming from Singapore Orchard street area and taking MRT allow about 45 minutes to get to the park. MRT plus a bus transfer is needed to arrive at the main gate. If you are driving by car it should take you about 30 minutes.

If you have the option I would arrive at the park around 11am and spend the day. Enjoy the shows. Everywhere you look there is something more to see. Don't rush the experience."
,,Amazing Grace,5.0,,"The bird park in Singapore is such a wonderful place to see many colourful and unsusual birds of the world. We didn't book the tours that go at $40each, we just decided one day to go and got there by the local bus near to our hotel. Cost $2 and $18 to go in. You are not tied to time doing it this way, and save money!"
,,great day out,5.0,,"we thoroughly enjoyed our half day at the park, in fact you need a slow full day, broken by lunch, to see all it has to offer. the giant cage and waterfall is awesome, and the arctic house great to escape into on a hot day.the park is very easy to get to and from, by metro and by a service bus. it is moderately expensive on entry, but we still felt it was good value"
,,A lovely day out,5.0,,"I wasn't sure about this one, as I thought it was really for families and childen. They are indeed very well catered for, with loads of things for the kids to do, but it is also a very interesting day out for adults too. Check out the amazing number of different types of birds they have there, walk through the 'jungle' with exotic birds flying around you, and suspend disbelief and go to the displays - they're great. And, being Singapore, this is spotlessly clean and so well organised!"
,,Should be Singapore's #1!,5.0,,"This is a stunning bird park with the most beautiful layed out open air bird cages I have ever seen. The showa are great, the staaf is great and the birds top them all. Do not read further: just go!"
,,A great day out at an underrated attraction,5.0,,"Jurong Bird Park is a great place to spend the day even if you're not the least bit interested in animals or birds. The wonderful range of bird species is a feast for the eyes even for someone like me who is more interested in architectural attractions rather than the natural wonders of the world. Not to be missed is the Bird Show at the Amphitheatre where a melange of parrots, macaws and other species enthrall visitors with their intelligence. I recommend taking a tram ride for an overview of the park, then explore the park on foot and get up close with the birds. The restaurant overlooking Flamingo Lake serves tasty local fare such as chicken rice and nasi lemak, and the usual crowd favourites such as club sandwiches and fish and chips, at very reasonable prices. In the afternoon, head to the Penguin Exhibit for a cool respite from the heat. Do drop by the world's largest open air aviary where you can view tropical birds in their natural habitat; there is also a scenic (man-made) waterfall which is a popular photo stop for couples and families."
,,obviously best for those interested in birds,4.0,,"If you are short of time in Singapore, this park may not be at the top of your ""must do"" list, unless you are a bird lover. However, for those with more time, or for people living in Singapore, this park is worth a visit. It was $18 per adult and an extra $5 for a monorail ticket. This makes it less expensive than the zoo, which makes sense as it is a smaller park (and just birds of course). I advise getting there early (it opens at 8.30 am) and going mid week if you can. We did this and felt we had done enough by lunchtime (when it seemed to be getting more crowded). There is plenty of shade and the avaries are green and very pleasant.

Opportunities to feed birds, who will land on you if you choose to do this. I love birds and am fascinated by them and so enjoyed having them so close. I got pooped on, but didn't mind this either. Other people, however, may get a bit bored of ""just birds"" and may not enjoy the close encounters. We didn't bother with either of the shows as we were happy to just look at all the exhibits (and play ""spot the bird""). Others may enjoy the park more, by going to each of the shows. If you do a morning visit, you can watch one show at 10 am and one at 11am.

Taxi costs around $25 from central Singapore and took around 20 mins - probably the best way to get there. Leaving at lunchtime, there were taxis waiting and no queue - very easy."
,,ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PLACES - LOVE IT!!,5.0,,"I love this place. It is big and interesting and just a fantastic place to visit. One of my top places to go to. I recommend it 100%. Go to all the shows they do. They are great, Also have the buffet lunch with the parrot show - excellent value!"
,,Recomend for Familys & Tourists - A Lovely Days with The birds,4.0,,"I will visited the park few times yearly. Just been there twice in August.
The lovely park to know more about birds, good for tourist who want to know about Tropical Birds Species. Especially the Hornbills & Toucans only can see in Tropical Jungle.
As for kids at Tropical would like to see the Pengiuns....

Things to brings, waters & umbrella, a good shoes to walk or take the Train

For a half a day intensive visit, I would suggest the itinerary as below. If time allow, I may suggest a whole day relaxing visit.
Reach the bird park at 8.30am, take a photo at entrance when not so clouded.
1. See the Pengiuns swim freely in the water, relax n enjoy an early morning.
2. Have a quick view at Flamingo Pool.
3. Visit the Owl at World of Darkness
4. Have a light jogging thru the walkway and reach the Lorry Loft.
5. 9.30am Give the Lorry some buy food and take photoes with them.
(note, if you visit the Lorry too late (after 10.30am), they are not hungry, they will not eat the food you give)
6. Jungle Jewels is GOOD to visit to know more about the birds habitat.
7. If you have time, you can go to African Waterfall or you should go to
8. 11am Bird n Buddies Show is the kids' Love show, end at 11.30am
When weather turn hot, you may decide to leave or to have a lunch here.
Hopes above is useful to you."
,,A must see attraction,4.0,,"My husband and I loved the three or so hours we spent at Jurong Bird Park. There was so many beautiful birds we enjoyed seeing. One or two of the enclosures are not well set up so as to see the birds but most of them excellent and we had no trouble seeing lots of birds and taking some good photos too.Take plenty of water, hat, suncream, etc, as it is very hot in the sun and the walkways between enclosures are not generally well covered. Arrive early if you want to see any of the shows as they fill up fast and again, terribly hot if you are in the sun. We decided to leave about 4pm and the line for the taxi was extremely long, and was moving fast until about 4.40pm, when we basically didn't see another taxi until after 5pm - there is an additional tariff on taxis after 5pm, hence why they disappeared. If you intend to take a taxi home in the afternoon, plan accordingly! We were there on a weekend, most of the patrons at the park seemed to be local people. Everything was excellent, and I wish we had made the effort to see the last couple of displays we missed but total exhaustion prevented us. For adults, it is easy to visit both this site and the zoo in the same day (as we did), catch a taxi between the two, they are cheap and it is not worth the time you lose to muck around on public transport."
,,Birds of same feather flock together,5.0,,"Are u a bird lover.. if the answer is yes, then JBP is the best place to be.. the amount of species that is there at the place is just awesome.. if you want to see well trained birds then this is the place where would see all the birds.. this is just awesome"
,,Jurong bird park deserves the best,5.0,,"This amazing place located in Singapore / Jurong is the largest bird park in the world with approx. 400 birds species. Great attractions specially the world of darkness with snowy owls , African waterfall aviary in the rain forest among thousands of african birds, eagles, hawks and falcons etc... etc... One day is not enough to discover this fantastic park in perfect surroundings. I can't wait to return there during muy next stay in Singapore"
,,Excellent bird park- a day trip to see it all,4.0,,"This is a very large and professionally presented bird park.

If you are interested in looking at birds, then this is an excellent place to visit, and you could easily spend a half day to full day walking around the park.

The range of birds, and the standard of presentation is superb.

Highly recommended, unless you have no interest in thisd type of attraction."
,,If you like birds or just colourful photo opportunities it's worth the visit,3.0,,"Easy to get to by MRT and bus. Fantastic entrance into the park with a good eatery right there too. Some of the exhibits are wow but others are just average with not much to see in some cases just a few ducks.
Most of the birds are caged behind wire that is very hard to take a picture through, can also be quite sad as some of the birds appear to have gone mad being stuck in the same rectangular cage. Other birds are lucky in that they are housed on huge open areas covered with bird net so they get to fly around amongst trees unlike their unluckier friends.
There's a monorail ride through the park but I can say it's nothing special, only useful if you need help to get around the park to some of the main exhibits but not so good for sight seeing in the park which is what they try to sell it as.
There's improvements going on to add childrens water playground facilities which may add more value for families going there.
A pleasant enough place to visit if you're not concerned with the sadness of animals locked away and unable to fly around."
,,Fabulous for everyone!,5.0,,"Jurong Birdpark in Singaporeis great fun for families, couples or on your own, firstly there is a monorail, so if you are feeling lazy or want to cool down, these are practical and tell you everything about the exibits you go past. There is 3 stations around the park (entrance, waterfall avairy and the toucan/ hornbills area) which are easily reached. I was there with the rest of my family- in total 2 adults 2 children. I thought the prices looked expensive but being there for 5 hours and not getting to see everything, the price seemed very reasonable. The exhibits themselves were large, spacouis and very entertaining. I would certainly suggest going to the 'Parrot Paradise' and the 'Pelican Cove' exhibits if you are lugging around children! Another great exibit for keen photographers as the birds are not particulaly shy.

If visiting, I would suggest you at least take S$100 for food, the gift shop, monorail and other extra activities withion the park. Also I suggest bringing bottles of water (it is really hot and drinks ane not exactly cheap!) and allowing a long and full day to visit as the park is bigger than you expect and the exibits are packed. Park openeing times are 8.30am to 6.00pm.
Have fun at the birdpark!"
,,Great park for an afternoon and shows ambition to even further improve.,5.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is simply a great way to spend a full afternoon. There are many large exhibits with impressive birds, but mainly the newer, more unique aviaries are really worth visiting. In the Lory Loft, you will be surrounded by dozens of the colourful lories while you walk on the suspended bridges at tree top level. The African Waterfall Aviary is a massive place and there is simply so much life everywhere you look. Also, I especially enjoyed the thunderstorm simulator in the Southeast Asian Birds Aviary; it was very interesting to see how all birds responded to sudden rain.
Throughout the day, there are many feeding and chit-chat sessions. So, no matter what time you drop by, there will always be enough going on. These sessions are great since they usually attract more birds and the staff surely tell you anything you would want to know.
Furthermore, every green area in Singapore is a rain forest trying to grow. This park is no exception and therefore the complete package of a well-maintained park with exotic birds in a dense forest environment is something that will make Jurong Bird Park stand out from similar attractions in Europe. I even spotted an enormous lizard, which wasn't even on display, it was a wild animal! That, you will not experience at home.

If you spend less than a week in Singapore, though, I think you might want to visit the Singapore Zoo instead. If you are here for a longer period, than definitely get the park-hopper pass for a great deal."
,,A good day out,4.0,,"This is a good place to spend a few hours with children who are interested in animals.

The penguin exhibit is spectacular - it is one of the few places where you can see live king penguins outside of Antarctica. The flamingo colonies were impressive and there are a lot of other interesting and informative exhibits.

The Park also has a good balance of eastern and western food."
,,Falconry Class,5.0,,"My husband and 3 boys (23, 18, 17) signed up to take the falconry class. Our concierge made the appt otherwise you have to be there before noon to sign up for the 2PM class. While we were waiting by the front gate the head falconer and 3 of his colleagues showed up with 3 falcons and 1 owl on their arms. They gave my husband and sons vests to put on and gloves and transferred the birds to their arms. A little crowd of guest amassed as my family proceeded to walk through the park each with a bird on their arm. My boys thought this was pretty cool. They stopped at a picturesque site and the park photographer took photos of them before proceeding to the falcon area where they hold the bird shows. Once in the area, they gave up their birds and the falconer and his staff brought out a secretary bird and began their training. They took up various positions around the arena and had a falcon fly from one to the other of them around the arena. They held up a plate in the air while kestrels flew by and grabbed pieces of meat off it. They had a couple different kinds of vultures they got to hold and feed too. My husband and the boys said this was one of the highlights of their trip. An experience they will never forget. The only downside was that it was extremely hot with not much shade. After they were done, they were given a bag that contained a photo of each of them with the bird on their arm, a certificate and an ornate box that held a falcon's hood. This last item was unexpected and treasured by all. An excellent value for the price we paid."
,,Lots of birds to see and fun for kids,4.0,,"Can probably do the park in half a day (3-4 hours) unless very interested in birds.
Worth paying for some feed in the Lorikeet enclosure as the birds will definitely come to you for the feed and may stand on your arm, shoulder or head.
Wheel chair accessible for most of park including monorail.
Food hall expensive by local standards eg $11 for bowl of noodle soup (compared with about half that in food courts around the city)
Enjoyable visit with lots of birds to see"
,,Lots to see and experience but can get tiring!,5.0,,"Even if you are not much of a bird lover, you will still love visiting Jurong Bird Park. With many bird species on display, some of which are 'open ranged', you can experience the birds in a way that is not only beneficial for the visitors, but also with the bird in mind. The aviaries are fantastic, especially the African Waterfall (with possibly the largest man-made waterfall in the world) and Lory Loft, themed with a vaguely Australian feel to it. Be careful if you want to walk the whole park though, as you will wear out your feet! However, the Panorail that surrounds the park is a relaxing way to get around the park ($5 fee). Highly recommended."
,,must visit jurong bird park if you are along with your kids in singapore....,5.0,,"jurong bird park
this place is little far from the central city but easily accesible .
this beautiful place is spread over acres of land .
its a place any animal or bird lover would not want to leave once they have entered that place.
there is a fee to visit this place.it is a little on the stiffer side but it is ok to go in once in a while .we need to carry out cameras ,preferably the ones with higher zoom and good lens quality so that you can capture each and every moment of some of the rarest birds in this universe.
we need atleast half a day to visit this place peacefully.
they have good offers for tickets with other attractions in singapore.
they have all the beautiful parrots , flamingos,vultures ,and all the other birds.
you can see the whole place in 2 ways either by walking and also by sky train that they have.
they have restuarant in side the park also and also outside they have ice cream parlour. and they also have a souviner shop outside the bird park where we can buy lovely replicas of the birds inside in forms or stuff toys ,key chains etc.
this is a place u must go if you are in singapore with ur kids ..."
,,Great for animal lovers.,4.0,,"I found this a really great experience. It was amazing to see birds like vultures up close and personal. And I was in awe of the ostrich display - they are so physically imposing to see in the flesh, they're massive!
But my favourite parts of the park were the 2 pengiun displays. One inside and one out. They are just gorgeous. The inside display with the above and below water viewing available is captivating and I could've stood here for hours watching them go about their daily business.
The park is well maintained and the staff were helpful.
There is a monorail to take you through all the displays (from above) but I preferred the walking option. It depends how much time you've got and how hot the day is though!"
,,Not really our thing...,3.0,,"This was my 2nd visit to Jurong Bird Park (my first visit was in 2002) and my wife’s first visit. Neither of us are bird lovers, but thought it would be a good way to spend a couple of hours around one of Singapore’s big attractions. Unfortunately we didn’t enjoy it as much as we thought we would.

We decided to take the MRT and bus to the park, which was pretty easy to do, although it did take a while to get there from the city. Our return trip, we decided to take a taxi, which although cost more, took about a quarter of the time. Bear in mind that if you take a taxi early or mid-morning out there, you may get caught in peak traffic, which may take just as long as the MRT and buses, plus cost you a lot more as well.

Tickets are about $25SG each which includes a ride on the monorail, which brings you to certain points, rather than walking through the whole park. There is a bird show you can watch which is entertaining and runs for about 25 minutes. The sad thing is that I watched the show both times I visited the park and the acts have not changed (in 9 years), but for a first timer, or a child, or a bird lover, it will no doubt entertain you.

There are also opportunities to take photos with some of the colourful birds and also feed other ones. We didn’t do the bird feeding, which I think was also included in your entry ticket.

The warmer than normal day probably didn’t help our visit, so we used the monorail a lot. There isn’t much of a wait between trains, but sometimes they’re full so you have to wait for another train. You’ll also have to climb up and down a couple of flights of stairs to get to the monorail stations, which wasn’t a problem, unless you have heaps of young kids in front of you descending slowly.

Jurong Bird Park wasn’t really for us, but as mentioned before, if you have kids, or a bird or nature lover, you’ll get real good value out of this."
,,Much better than I thought it would be.,4.0,,"My wife and I visited Singapore for our anniversary and I literally had to drag my wife to Jurong bird park. My wife thought it was just a zoo only with birds, but I knew it would be romantic. It was definitely romantic and beautiful.
I definitely recommend if your traveling with your spouse or with kids, or if you love birds or simply just like taking pictures.
We did not bother with the monorail as you have to pay and I think it was a more rewarding experience simply walking.
My favorite was the Lori loft, a unique experience. I really liked the African aviary as well enjoying the view of the waterfall.
It truly was a great a memorable experience.
The food at the restaurant in front was really good too.
If you plan a visit here plan to spend the day.
I also fed an Ostritch which was pretty cool."
,,Very Nice Bird Experience,4.0,,"The birds at the Jurong Bird Park were spectacular. We are not birders and don't pretend to know intimate details about what we saw. We were there in mid-February 2011 and the small showers and humidity of Singapore did not deter us from wandering around the park. We found the park and habitats for the birds to be beautifully maintained. The birds from all over the world were fantastic. We did not go to any of the shows while at the park. We spend almost 4 hours walking around the park and enjoying our day.

We had purchased the Park Hopper pass that allowed entrance to the Jarong Bird Park, the Singapore Zoo, and the Night Safari at a net discount of $12. Of the three, I would rate the Bird Park #1, the Zoo a close second and the Night Safari last."
,,"Good, but not as awesome as rated here",3.0,,"It's worth a visit, but if you've been to the Bird park in KL, you can give this a miss. The Birds n Buddies Show was brilliant, but we coudnt stay for the Birds of Prey Show."
,,Shows were good..don't take panorail ride,3.0,,"Birds in the cages were difficult to see or take photographs, best parts of the bird park were flamingo in the pond, penguin area, birds and buddies show, creatures of prey show,

Panorail ride is too fast, does not give a good view of the birds. If you can walk for an hour, please take the walk to enjoy the bird park. you will the birds and buddies show. A three hour trip in the forenoon or afternoon is good enough time for the bird park"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"The birdpark follows the same concept as the zoo and the night safari. One can explore the park by one own, take a ride with a ""train"" and see some good animal shows.
Just like the other parks the number of animals is limited however the presentation is excellent. Staff is friendly, enthusiastic and helpful. The drinks and deserts at the restaurants are good but the food is average and pricey.

All in all a good one time experience."
,,Just OK,3.0,,"After reading a bunch of glowing reviews on this site, I put down the Jurong Bird Park as a not-miss. I ended up pretty disappointed. It's basically just an average zoo with nothing but birds. The walk-in aviaries were fun, but they were quite small and there weren't that many birds around (or maybe they were all hiding?), so I didn't get any sort of sensation of being in an enclosed forest. In fact I walked around the waterfall one for quite awhile without seeing any birds at all. I think just as many birds fly above my head in an average visit to a park. There are a few other birds in cages, but it's not really more exciting than seeing the few birds at the zoo if you're planning on going. Plus, the park is quite a hike outside of town (took me 40 min from my hotel, including having to take a taxi from the subway station). I would say skip it unless you have a lot of time. Also, a previous commenter mentioned even people who didn't like birds would love it - so not true. I usually love birds and zoos and I was lukewarm. Finally, if you are going to KL definitely skip this - I thought their bird park was much better with birds wandering out in the open everywhere and aviaries with many more birds to see."
,,Look for attractions!,4.0,,"Compared to night safari, it's considerably cheap.
Make sure you check the schedules of attractions (shows and feeding time). Some of them are very fun and interesting. (Except the penguins feeding show, as there were no seats, not much space, but too many people. A great disadvantage to short people).

I didn't really like the restaurants inside the park, there wasn't much choice and information in the brochures. I saw a family bringing boxed meals from home and ate there, and I regretted I didn't do the same."
,,"Zoo quality, without the crowds and smell",5.0,,"Cinderella's sister to the more glamorous and famous Singapore Zoo (and Night Safari), I actually much preferred the Bird Park because it's not so crowded. Birds also don't smell as bad as most of the animals LOL.

Plenty of lovely feathered friends to see and animal shows as entertaining as the Zoo's. The Park is being upgraded so it's looking more like the Zoo -- refreshed displays and ""designer look"" safari decor. Great treat for adults and kids alike."
,,Really nice bird park,5.0,,"This was a really nice bird park. Here you can look at many birds and the park is very clean. Its a huge park with two different bird shows.
the park even has a train that goes around the park, here you can look at birds from every high u want.
Enjoy this park - the birds are pretty and happy here. Good service and friendly keepers here."
,,It's huge..,4.0,,"Yopu need one full day to cover this bird park. Unlike other parks,this one hosts a wide variety of birds. Bird shows are great for children. You can also take a Panorail when tired."
,,Take Your Time in the Aviaries,5.0,,"Although the staff encourage everyone to see the shows, I found the best part was sitting in the walk-in aviaries and just observing the birds close hand. Don't miss the lories!"
,,The shows were the highlight at the park,4.0,,"The kids (5 and 7) were not up to visiting citing we saw birds at the zoo! We watched the Birds of Prey and Buddies show and the kids loved them. They were great hearing the bird speak in three different languages and sing songs was worth seeing. It had a playground which is always a plus if you have younger kids. I think a half day is a good amount of time unless you are an enthusiast or a photographer. We bought the 3-1 in pass for zoo, safari and bird park. I recommend doing the 2-1 and skip the safari. Although note tram rides are not included in price."
,,Stunning variety of beautiful birds !,5.0,,"This is a not-to-be-missed attraction in Singapore ~ I defy anyone who's not even interested in birds not to be impressed with Jurong Bird Park. We did the panorail ride round the park first to give us an overview, then walked everywhere as well. Make sure you allow plenty of time as you'll want to stop and stare frequently and take loads of photos. The variety and colour of the birds is stunning and it's good to see them more or less flying free in the huge aviaries (apart from the birds of prey)."
,,Beautiful Park,5.0,,"This is a beautiful rainforest bird park with housing an enormous number of species. Very peaceful and tranquil park with very lively and entertaining animals shows held everyday. People of any age would enjoy this park, not just kids. You can spend a leisurely relaxing day here.

My entrance ticket I won me a beautiful freshwater pearl extracted from an shell chosen by me. It was a very exciting experience to see a pearl extracted from an oyster."
,,Must see for all,5.0,,Its a great park. I felt I saw a bird in every color. Probably the fashion designers are influenced by the beautiful combination of colors on the birds. We loved it. Its a treat to your eyes. 3 hrs as suggested in the website is not enough. You need a day. Kids will love it
,,A bird park which is actually interesting!,5.0,,"The name suggests a quite boring, zoo like place. But to my surprise, i actually enjoyed this Zoo for Birds! A number of very unique attractions are offered here unlike anywhere in the world like:

- Feed the birds! Man they sit on you everywhere...
-The birds show (cant remember what it was called) true highlight of the bird park
- Penguins in Singapore!

If Ur the slightest bit into birds, go for it..."
,,Very good. My two kids (5&1) had a great...,5.0,,Very good. My two kids (5&1) had a great time .
,,The Best Bird Park I've Ever Seen,5.0,,"At first glance I did not think a park with just birds would interest me, but I was so wrong. What a beautiful park is this. Beautifully constructed and so many different, colorful birds that it can't possibly bore you.
It is recommended to use the monorail, but if you're a good walker, walking through the park is a much better option. You'll see so much more.

Tip: Buy a 3-in-1 ticket for the Jurong Bird Park, The Zoo and the Nightsafari. You will regret it, if you don't visit all three parks."
,,Birds n Buddies,5.0,,"I was surprised n shocked out of my wits to see the amazing setup these guys have arranged for through the Birds n Buddies show. I always thought that its dogs who understand the human language very well and maybe some more animals, but to see birds interact so well with humans was awe-striking. My mouth was open and eyes bursting out...I had never imagined that birds can be trained to such amazing levels....its a must see for all as u wont get to see it anywhere else.
Always buy the park hopper ticket for 2in1 or 3in1 and dont waste money on the trams."
,,A must for bird lovers,5.0,,"Having been to a few bird parks in different countries, I can honestly say this is one of the best. They have a great collection and most of the birds are in big free-fly aviaries or good sized cages and they all looked healthy and well cared for. I attended 3 feeding times (African birds, penguins and lories) and would recommend trying to be there at the right time of day to experience these.

Be warned that a trip to Jurong Bird Park will take at least half a day (5 hours) of your time if you take public transport. The park itself requires"
,,Lots and lots of birds,4.0,,"Jurong Bird park is one of the best parks in Singapore. It has lots of birds. I had three children with me, 1,6 and 9. It was great for us to see different species of birds and plants. One word of warning, if you are not used to Singapore weather, make sure you always bring water with you. They have some that you can buy but at times it seemed there were not enough water spots. We enjoyed the layout of the park and found it to be very interesting."
,,don't miss this one,5.0,,"I've always wanted to go to the bird park and finally on this visit to Singapore I actually managed to get there. It was probably the highlight of this visit to Singapore (apart from the shoe shopping of course). We got a taxi from the centre of town for about $20 and spent half a day walking around seeing all the birds. The shows were terrific and there was a huge shade canopy over the large seating area. The monorail around the park gave us a great view of everything but we did walk around the whole park first. If you are feeling hot, the penguin exhibit or the coffee shop in the Lory Loft are great places to cool down. We'll definitely be back again."
,,excellent- IF you are interested in birds you need a full day,5.0,,"We wanted to get to the Jurong bird park early to beat the heat but the first tourist bus didn't leave till 9:10 (( SAEX tour bus- leaves from many hotels) so again we took 2 trains & 1 bus to get there & it took 1 hour 15 minutes- we beat the bus by only 45 minutes to the park & in retrospect I would just take a cab or take the tourist bus instead of the long mass transit ride. We loved the bird park & stayed the entire day. We strongly feel that it is a whole day trip IF you like birds & want to go slowly to enjoy them.

The early and late falconry (birds of prey) shows were different and I thought it was worth seeing both since they had different birds and demonstrations. The ""Birds & Buddies"" show was corny but cute - better for kids probably.

Best exhibits - the waterfall walk-in aviary to see the ""thunderstorm"" at noon. One of the birds actually landed on my shoulder as I was trying to feed the others - he scared me half to death but I loved it! We also liked the walk-in aviary & Lorry loft (beautiful birds and they get SO CLOSE) - all were highlights.

Tram- you can only go around once & the trip is broken down into 3 sections. We really would not even recommend it as you don't see anything different from walking. Skip it if you are short on time. We did go in the early pm when it was very hot out to sit in the AC for awhile.

Transport home- only 2 tourist buses so we took the later one at 5:15. The bus only took 35 minutes compared to 1hr 15 minutes via mass transit so was definitely a lot easier & faster."
,,Perfect for family with kids,3.0,,"I recently came back from Singapore and had a chance to visit Jurong Bird Park.
I was at the park during Chinese new year so it was decorated with red and chinese new year decorations.

The park itseft is far from the city. I stayed at the hotel on Orchard road and had to take MRT all the way to the end of the city, took me about 45 minute on MRT and also 10 minute on the bus to bird park. Total travel time is 1.5 hour each way.

Bird park is another version of San Diego zoo in my opinion. They could have done better I believe. The water quality in the pond/ lake is bad. I understand that the park has been opened for decade, at least they should have renovated it or add more attraction.

Anyway, I had fun walking around and waterfall at Africa section is cool. I think family with kids is perfect for the park.

If you're looking for something nature then it's a choice for you. You'll need half day to enjoy the park includes travel time."
,,Good Family Attraction,3.0,,"Its quite a fun experience if you're travelling with family & kids, otherwise you can surely skip this & just do the Night Safari!"
,,Do the park at your own pace. Don't take a bus tour!,4.0,,"I had a fabulous time at the park, but I made the costly mistake of getting talked into going there with a tour. It was billed as a 3-hour tour and cost $40. The concierge at the Allston hotel said it was worth it because it takes an hour to get to the park on the MRT whereas with the tour I'd get there in a half hour. Plus, he said, a taxi would cost nearly $40 there and back and then I'd have to buy the admission ticket. So, I figured what the heck. Turned out the ride to the park took an hour and a half because first we went to a main meeting point where we waited and waited. By the time we got to the park, we were told we had just under 2 hours. My ticket also included a tour on the elevated tram, which I used because I was afraid I would not make it around the park in time. Unfortunately, with the tram, you miss a lot. It would have been MUCH better on foot, at my own pace. I wound up ditching the bus ride back and taking the bus to the MRT (which was an hour-long journey from park to City Hall station). The tour also did not include any special info about the birds, as I thought it would. It was not really a tour at all, but a bus that takes you to and from the park and does not give you enough time to see everything. (*Note: the reason I took the tour from the Allston hotel was because on the park's website it says there is a bus to the park that leaves twice a day from in front of the Allston hotel. Neither my hotel, the Carlton, which is right nearby, nor the Allston, thought this existed.)"
,,Don't miss this!,5.0,,"This place is wonderful. The Lory bird section is crazy! There are thousands of them flying around, and for a few pennies you can buy some sugar water in a little cup and they come and sit on your shoulder/arm/head to drink it. Very cool. Also the bird of prey show is not to be missed. I had an enormous vulture fly so close over my head his leg reigns hit me! Fantastic. There is so much there... you have to go!!!"
,,Just Terrific,5.0,,We loved the Bird Park and the show was well worth rushing to get there on time. They made good points about the environment and the bird performances were great. We liked it a lot better than the Night Safari!
,,Parents bringing kids with trollies....Not a good idea to go.,1.0,,"I went to Jurong Bird Park in Singapore on 26 September with my wife and 3 kids. We arrived at 1130hr local time and had lunch in the restaurant. The restaurant is unique in the way that all the seats are all made of metal made into different kinds of animal figures. We entered the attraction at 1215hr and took some pictures and went to see a show. The show started at 1230hr and finished at 1300hr. We, then, went around the park and did not enjoy it at all. This is because the attraction is very not family friendly, especially for me who brought along 2 baby trollies. There are too many flight of stairs need to be taken to view the attraction close range. Although there are ramp at some of the attraction, it is not designed well in the sense that after going through the attraction, as we are going to exit, there will be another flight of stairs to negotiate. In the end, we will have to exit from where we enter. And the contour of the landscape in not friendly to us who will be pushing the trollies around the park as we need to walk uphill at one part of the park. I saw a lot of other tourist who will carry the trollies up and down to stairs, just like I did. In the end, we left the park at 1330hr which speaks volume as to how much we did not enjoy the outing."
,,Must see place in Singapore,5.0,,We visited Jurong bird park this summer. Kids loved it. The best in the whole world. Loved the colorful birds. Kids got a chance to feed the birds. That was very memorable. Highly recommended to adults and definitely kids. Go for it.
,,A Unique Experience,4.0,,"A visit to Singapore would not be complete unless you took the time to visit the Jurong Bird Park. It is a unique place with a lot of activities for kids as well as entertainment in the form of the Bird Show.

Getting there is quite easy, take the MRT to Boon Lay and then walk across to the Bus Station (all under cover) to stand 194. This bus takes you to the Park, dropping you off about 200 metres from the entrance with a short uphill walk to buy your ticket. Once inside you can either choose to walk around or you can take the monorail and hop off at one of the three stations to enjoy the exhibits.

One of the best exhibits is Lorrie's Loft, a huge walk in aviary where you can stroll among the birds and for a small fee purchase some honey and water mix and feed the birds. These colorful birds will come and sit on your hands, head or shoulders to eat and make a great photo experience if you have kids.

The park boasts the largest man made waterfall in the world and there are ample opportunities to take pictures of the colourful wildlife that abounds the park. It has a very nice range of cafes and souvenire shops where you can buy a variety of things from as little as S$3.00.

One word of warning though, make sure you take plenty of water as the park is quite hilly and with the humidity it makes for a thirsty walk."
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,"We caught a taxi from Orchard. Took around 20 minutes and cost around $20.

Has to be the best bird park we have been to. The parrots, horn bills and the waterfall aviary were the best displays in my opinion, but the others were all good. The penguin and puffin feeding was very good also.

We were all tired as this was our 3rd ""animal affair"" in 3 days after the zoo and the night safari, and the weather wasn't good with light rain the whole time we were there, but we still enjoyed it. Took us about 3 hours to walk around (we didn't use the monorail at all).

We booked a 3 park pass (zoo, night safari and bird park) at a cost of $S 45 per person, which I thought was excellent value.

If I had to make a choice between the 3, this would probably come third, but it is a great place to visit and I recommend it if you have the time."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,The bird park is quite a long way out of the city and requires a train and bus. It took 30 minutes on the train from Outram park station and we had to wait at least 15 minutes for the bus so it might be worth picking up one of the special buses advertized on their web site. It has lots of shade and we liked the penguin enclosure as a place to get away from the heat.! The monorail had poor air conditioning so we were glad to get off it. We didn't really have enough time to do the park justice but it was a good mornings activity.
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"I visited the Jurong Bird Park in May 09. The show Birds of Prey was great to watch - hint: if you want to be chosen as a volunteer to hold a hawk, it helps to sit right up front and get there early. The Birds n' Buddies show, while sounding like a kids show (with people dressed up as birds) is actually not at all - the show is predominantly live birds and was very enjoyable (as an adult watcher). The bird enclosures around the park hold a variety of birds and some I have never seen. There are not a lot of photo opportunities (the birds often fly away high up and most are behind bars) but there are several areas (like the African Waterfall Encounter) where you can get up close (if they fly by you). Overall an enjoyable day that can be done in half a day (if pushed for time)."
,,jurong bird park,5.0,,"The jurong bird park was simply awesome...
There were trainers who had bird shows in which there were parrots singing , playing basketball, doing stunts etc. the rapport they had was quite unbelievable.
they have also maintained the space / privacy of the birds, which is quite important.
i would give a 9 on 10 for jurong bird park.
simply shoudn't miss it if u are in singapore."
,,A must attraction for kids!,5.0,,Preity as it is! weither u want to tae pic with real parrots perched on your hands!! or to be up close with rare species of birds!! come here for a birdical experience!! a must visit!!
,,Excellent aviary experience in Singapore,5.0,,"The Jurong Bird Park is accessible by MRT (Boon Lay stop with Bus 194 or 251) or taxi.

The park is run by the same folks who run the Zoo and it is similarly designed, with a user-friendly layout, circular tram, numerous free shows throughout the day, and several interactive exhibits. It can be appreciated by people with a passing interest in birds (like myself), or those who are more serious about the topic.

The highlights:

Lory Loft: You can reenact Hitchcock’s “The Birds” by feeding these as they perch on your shoulder and wrist. Over 1,000 birds are enclosed in a 9 story cage and they are very, very hungry. You can feed them a watered down gruel mixture for 3$ SGD. I had no idea what I was getting into which made it even better.

Birds of Prey Show: Free entertainment, just get there 15-20 minutes early to secure a good seat. Jugglers and dancers warm the crowd up before the show starts. The staff has done an excellent job of entertainment here as the birds swoop about six inches from your head for about 30 minutes. There is also a memorable show on falconry.

SE Asian bird enclosure: Peacocks just hanging around, walking on the side walk. Many other memorable exhibits and a virtual “thunderstorm” at noon every day.

Highly recommended."
,,an awesome bird park,4.0,,"Went to this place during our August 2008 trip to Singapore. Often go back to see relatives, but have never visited this park. Decided to go, it was a great day out.

I am not a bird fanatic, but absolutely loved the shows. Made me fear how intelligent birds are!

We also managed to take a photo with colourful birds at the entrance of the bird park...they photograph excellent. Probably wouldn't recommend doing this on a busy day as thebirds seem like they could get agitated easily.

By the end of the day I was very tired... the park was too big to fully walk the whole thing and finish it. I don't think we ended up finishing the zoo.

Glad we went, however probably wouldn't visit it again if we were in Singapore again... must do once =)"
,,Great Place to Viist,4.0,,"The bird park is a great day out, easy to get to and very well stocked with birds. The Lory Loft is wonderful and shows how captive birds can be given the chance to fly and engage in natural behaviours. The park places great emphasis on education and is good for kids. Some of the birds are in very poor housing, I felt sorry for the owls in their night house, no room to fly, no stimuation, very sad. I think there is a whole issue around keeping birds captive for public amusement but it is legal and Jurong certainly tries its best."
,,A Must-visit Destination in Singapore,5.0,,"A very good and well manicured bird conservation area in Singapore. There are so many different species of bird from all over the planet which all visitors can enjoy. To make it easier to greet all those birds, the organizer put them in a various category such as: 'Birds of Paradise', 'Unflying birds', World of Darkness', etc.

There are some supporting facilities which included so that all visitors can enjoy their visit there such as, Bongo Burger (located in front of the main entrance - sell burgers and other snacks), Black Canyon Coffee (located inside the park near the lory bridge area), Bird Amphitheater (Outdoor theater shows bird attraction), Water Aviary (One of the tallest man made waterfall in the world), Monorail (which can help visitors access all area in Jurong Bird Park).

Jurong Bird Park can be easily accessed by car (taxi, etc) or by MRT (Underground). While using MRT visitor can stop by at Jurong station, one stop away after Chinese Garden Station. Jurong Bird Park oftenly offers promotion for tourist like 50% discounts for 2nd person, free tickets for using the monorail, discounts in Bongo Burger, ets.

So, enjoy your visit there, bring all your family also."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,This is a must-visit. Spend at least half-a-day to experience the whole of Jurong Bird Park. It's an amazing attraction for tourists. Kids will really love it. Don't miss!
,,Really worth it,5.0,,"Don't pass up this place. If you have the time, plan on visiting all three of the major wildlife attractions in Singapore. Get the pass that includes the Bird Park, The Zoo, and the Night Safari. It's very affordable. We did all three in one day and had a great time. Singapore's transit makes it pretty easy to get around as well.

Lots O' Birds! Plus you get to feed the Lorikeets!"
,,Easily as good as the zoo.,5.0,,"My family LOVES the bird park! When we've been it's always been a really peaceful, tranquil setting in which to see heaps of cool birds up close.
The gardens are beautifully laid out with lots of room for all the birds and a really good range of birds to see. Imagine seeing penguins in the tropics!!
Just a great place for adults and children. Lots to see, exciting bird shows and really well maintained.
I definitely recommend a visit here as a top thing to do in Singapore."
,,Feathered Friends,2.0,,"The place is huge. There's tram servicing the place.
There hundreds of species to see, that I am sure probably not present in several countries.

There are some shows also which the guests can enjoy and learn from

There is also a shuttle from the bus stop to pick up and drop off the guests so it is accessible"
,,Birds by the hundred,5.0,,"Singapore's Jurong Bird Park is up there on my list of places I always go to when visiting Singapore.

The Bird Park is one of a linked set of three attractions including the Zoo and Night Safari. A combined ticket for all three attractions costs around 45$S per person, saving about 12$S per head.

The park has its Panorail, a suspended light railway that goes around the park stopping at three locations, which costs extra. When I use it I tend to get on at the main entrance station and ride all the way round to give a panoramic view of the park before moving on to walk around, as not everything is close to a station.

The park is laid out in a rough loop with a connection across the middle. There is a cluster of exhibits near the main entrance that are worth exploring before moving around. I then tend to go around the loop anticlockwise. Some exhibits are on side paths that you have to go off the main loop to explore properly.

Generally I will spendmost of or an entire day here, I do not think a half day allows me to really take everything in - although if pressed for time then exhibit selection and the panorail would allow a quicker visit.

Some exhibits are fully open (the Riverine and flamingo areas), some are cage based (the parrots) and some are walk through, including the major exhibits of the Waterfall aviary and the Lory Loft. These two exhibits are large walk in aviaries. The Lory loft sells dishes of food that will attract the birds close to you - they will clamber all over you so if you like looking at birds but are nervous if they do start walking all over you, be warned. In the waterfall aviary the birds tend to stay further away and you will need to move slowly round the jungle landscaped paths to avoid spooking them. The Aviary also includes the man made waterfall which is spectacularly well done.

There are large number of rain shelters and drink vending machines around the bird park, and making use of them is a very good idea. A rainier day, with multiple showers as opposed to continuous rain, does not spoil the park for me as I find it easier to walk round on a cooler day and there are a number of exhibits that provide cover as well as the shelters. A number of places sell snacks as well.

There are a number of shows and feeding times around the park. Be sure to decide if you wish to see any, as some are repeated in a day and some are not. A few to note - there two bird of prey shows in the day but they each display different sets of birds, the South East Asian birds aviary simulates a thunderstorm at midday each day and the kids parrot show only runs once a day.

I would say is most spectacular feeding for me is the Bee-eater/Starling feeding in the waterfall aviary. Get there before the feed time and find the correct area to wait (ask for directions within the aviary). The area is quiet jungle until the food arrives and then birds flock down and surround the area, perching everywhere.

Its definitely a place to see. I tend to just get a taxi to and from the attraction, but MRT and bus links are also good."
,,Wonderful Experience,4.0,,I have always been fascinated by birds and this was an absolute paradise for a bird lover. The best feature of all is a giant tropical aviary where the birds are free to fly but can be easily seen. Wonderful
,,don't go on a rainy day!,4.0,,"We went to Jurong twice during our recent visit. Our first visit was 'rained off'. It is very easy to get here, MRT to Boon Lay and then bus 194. The combined fare was approx $8 for the three of us.
Entrance without the panorail ride was $35 approx for the 3 of us. We watched the birds and buddies show which was fun but perhaps a little long!

The walk in aviaries are a highlight. We all especially enjoyed the Lory Loft and the opportunity to feed the birds with little pots.

The choice of food was limited although the prices were reasonable.

A highly recommended day out for folks with or without children."
,,Incredible! Do this tour!,5.0,,"Incredible, incredible, incredible! My mum and I almost left this tour off our itinerary but we are SO glad we didn't! I am not an avid ""bird person"" or anything but the whole experience was very impressive! The grounds were beautiful, the birds (parrots) were very tame and the monorail made getting round the park super easy and the bird show was amazing.

Firstly, jump aboard the air-conditioned monorail to the first stop where you will find Toucan and my favourite, the parrots (see photos!) The parrot enclosure was almost surreal, most people go there first so we went to the Toucans first and when we went to the parrots, go the whole place to ourselves! The parrots were VERY tame letting us touch them!!

There are more stops along the monorail or you can choose to walk. You do see more but the air-conditioning was impossible to resist! At one of the stops you can choose to get out at a ""station"" and go on a short walk to see the waterfall... it is definately worth the walk as the area has cleverly concealed mist machines and a bridge... the atmosphere is beautiful.

After you have had a walk around / monorail ride around you can head to the amphitheatre for a bird show. Again, my mum and I weren't sure as to whether we would find it boring but it was absolutely great! I don't want to spoil all the suprises so I won't share too much, but you will see some truly amazing stunts by various types of birds, even a singing parrot! We were really impressed and at the end of the show, if you make a donation to the park (down the front, near the stage) the parrots will give you a postcard of one of the stars of the show!

Jurong bird park really was a wonderful day out, it exceeded our expectations immensly and I definately recommend a visit to anyone. Even if like myself, you are not an avid ""bird lover"" it really is amazing and well worth a visit! I would go again!!"
,,Singapore Bird Park coffee shop a great place for a break,4.0,,"When you're at the Singapore Bird Park, tired and hungry and need a place to stop, rest, and have a bite to eat or a cup of coffee, head for the Australian Lory (these are colorful birds indigenous to Australia) stop. The entrance houses a little coffee shop that features Australian coffee and sandwiches, and an ice cream bar, a nice change from the curry puff stands found elsewhere in the park."
,,"Great range of species, spectacular aviaries, only a few poor exhibits",4.0,,"Being birders on our first visit to Singapore, the Jurong Bird Park seemed to offer a relaxing way to see a range of species in one place. We weren't disappointed. For a very reasonable admission price we spent at least three hours wandering among the wide range of exhibits and we didn't see them all. The park is about the right size for a good afternoon's walk. For an extra charge, you can use the elevated monorail. Since the monorail did not offer access to anything we couldn't get to on foot, the only benefit we could see was its air conditioning.

The range of species on display is extremely broad -- from large birds of prey, through parrots of all description, to jungle-floor dwelling creatures of impressive colour. Sea birds are under-represented but there is compensation in the variety of Amazonian and Southeast Asian forest birds. We learned a lot about the birds native to the Malaysian jungles. Why the Bird Park bothers with penguins, I don't know, given Singapore's constant hight temperatures and humidity.

The variety of habitats is impressive. The parrots are mixed in a maze of very large cages with heavy greenery. The pelicans and flamingos have their own lake. The lorikeets have an aviary. In fact, we counted this aviary -- ""The Lory Loft"" -- as the highlight: a giant 4-story netted aviary housing a small forest over which we could walk on a connected series of towers, catwalks, and suspension bridges. The lorikeets zoom around in small flocks passing only inches away. What a delight. The Amazon jungle aviary, with its large dark forest and high waterfall was also spectacular. If you take the time to watch and wait at the right spots (a feeder is a good bet), you can spot a large range of species among the trees. Also worthwhile was the extensive display of jungle-floor birds.

On the dark side, some habitats were inadequate to the point of being cruel. In this category we place the World of Darkness (some magnificent owls sitting in an enclosed room with scenes painted on the wall), the water birds exhibit (cormorants and gulls sitting around a concrete pond), the birds of prey lane (where the trained birds wait all day in a small room tethered to a perch for an hour's exercise), the ostriches and cassowaries in undersize pens, and the eagle enclosures (where giant birds such as Griffon Vultures and Stellars Sea Eagles gaze despondently from the top of a concrete wall in a tall narrow caged area).

The two shows we attended -- All Stars and Birds of Prey -- were well conducted and entertaining. These shows are valuable mainly for the opportunity to have a close look at birds in flight. The birds of prey handlers were a bit rough on the birds but having a vulture brush the top of the audience's heads was worth seeing. If only the presenters would stop feeling a need to shout into their microphones.

In general, the park is aimed at children and families, but the serious bird lover can find a lot of quiet spots in the park to admire a parrot or kingfisher.

Two minor problems of note: First, we saw rats on at least four occasions. They seem to be attracted by the bird feed. We also saw several live traps discreetly placed around enclosures so the park is obviously aware of the problem. Second, the gift shop was extremely thin on stock. We were hoping for the kind of high-quality merchandise of the kind you find in most museum gift shops, and perhaps even some bird-related books, CDs, and magazines. No such luck -- only generic trinkets and post cards were on offer.

Overall, a worthwile afternoon."
