,,Memorable,5.0,,I think a gaze of glimpse of these army officials can bring back memories for anyone in ranks. They look so real. I think it is like time travel. I was amazed by the battlebox.
,,"Battlebox, Fort Canning Singapore",5.0,,"A very interesting and enjoyable experience. My 16 year old Granddaughter really enjoyed it too. The young lady who took us round was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions. I felt that having a guide to set the scene was better than having to read all about it, on the displays, as we did in the exhibition on Santosa Island."
,,Excellent Guided Tour,5.0,,"There were a limited number of tickets available for each tour so I was lucky as a solo tourist I was allowed into the 2:45pm tour (even though the sign said full) as the last person. It always pays to double check with the counter.

At the beginning of our tour our guide (unfortunately forgot her name) said we would be quizzed at the end!

We walked a short way to the bunker entrance and got a bit of history on Fort Canning and some of the remaining above ground attractions. After walking into the bunker our guide closed the heavy entrance door behind us.

The museum did a great job recreating the settings, both artifacts and figures, in various rooms to represent the key people and activities on the final days before Singapore’s fall to the Japanese in WWII. The movies and our guides great knowledge helped us better under the events and definitely made this one of the best guided tours I’ve joined to date. Well worth the admission.

I was awed by the conditions that these soldiers had to endure to stay protected and keep lines of communication going through out the war.

At the end of our tour we had a wrap up back in the gift shop and our guide followed through with her quiz. One prize for children and one for the adults.

If you have time wander through Fort Canning and find the escape exit from the bunker. I attached a photo of what it looks like now ( modified and no longer hidden)."
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,This was an amazing tour. One of the best I've done and we've been to WW2 exhibits all across the world. Definitely recommend.
,,An Unexpected Gem,5.0,,"The battle box is s real gem right in the heart of Singapore. I just stumbled across it by chance after detouring off the main road to walk up Fort Canning Hill. I’ve found when travelling that these unexpected discoveries are often the most rewarding.

It’s a great story to tell and our guide was very knowledgeable and clearly enjoyed delivering her talk.

All in all a great experience and highly recommended.

,,Battlebox Tour,5.0,,Very informative and interesting - not over the top with details and the tour moved at a relaxing pace . A good starting spot for touring with Orchard Road and museum close by plus lovely parkland around the battlebox .
,,What an interesting place!,5.0,,"The story of the surrender of Singapore in World War II was told in such an interesting way. It would be impossible to not be enthralled by the bunker and its place in history. I learnt so much in a short period of time. And on a hot day in Singapore, the bunker was a cool change. If history interests you, do not miss this place."
,,very informative and historical overview,5.0,,"Excellent guide and information provided , laid out facts and had displays to provide visual details which I enjoyed. I would recommend this tour if your interest is WW2 history."
,,Review of the British Command & Control Bunker,4.0,,"The museum displays were interesting in relation to the bunker, unfortunately there were not much time allowed to review the individual displays. The presentation by the official guide was factual without depth in detail. Overall good for the general public consumption but not enough for anyone with a keen eye on history."
,,Worth a look,5.0,,"This is a guided tour and as such relies heavily on the quality of the guide. When I visited, the guide was superb. Very knowledgeable and friendly. The museum itself is quite thought provoking. It certainly made me about a piece of grim history that took place not all that long ago. Highly recommended."
,,Battlebox tour,5.0,,Very informative and educational tour. Tour guide gave good information on the historic events and the battlebox itself had some displays and artifacts.
,,Battle box tour,2.0,,"If you plan to take young children you’ll need to have them on a tight leash. The tour guide was intolerant of young children’s noise(questions, amazement and gasps) throughout the tour. We were asked at the first video to remove our child as the tour guide “had received a complaint”. We were 10mins into the tour, our group consisted of 3 other people - just to put things into perspective.

My advice would be don’t spend your money on this tour unless your children are of an age where they fully comprehend ‘don’t utter a sound’. Otherwise there’s a fair chance you’ll be asked to leave the tour and therefore miss interesting information about the war. Something that is not mentioned when booking the tour but definitely worth knowing.

To note the information was interesting and environment is safe and clean for well bodied people."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"I went to visit the Battle Box with someone who was interested in seeing it, I was only mildly interested, but I was blown away by the tour. It definitely exceeded expectations.

The battle box has been very well restored and the tour guide was very knowledgeable, so I feel that I really learnt a lot during the tour. The size and complexity of the site amazed me.

For anyone interested in history, I highly recommend the tour."
,,WWII Enthusiast,4.0,,Joann Is an enthusiastic guide. Her comments often directly overlapped with the video segments we watched during the tour which reinforced the info but also left me wondering if there is another level to be reached in educating those on the tour. Overall very good.
,,EXCELLENT TOUR,5.0,,"This tour was one of the best I did! It was neat to see but also informative. I learned so much and was able to use that information when doing other tours, such as Fort Siloso."
,,Check the tour times!,4.0,,"Great bit of history related by a well informed guide. Tours are timed and can fill up quickly so book ahead or get there in plenty of time. Its a hot slog up all those steps!
Learnt an awful lot about an awful time in history. It is a real shame that having completed the tour you can't go back to take in all the maps and posters on display as there is not time on the organised tour which has to keep together."
,,Interesting,5.0,,"Interesting multimedia exhibition with a lot of coverage on Fort Canning's contribution during the 2nd world war.
Writing multimedia: there are multimedia components but in addition to that there are a lot of original or replicated goods shown during the tour. This is somewhat diminished by the fact that due to growth of plants a lot of the locations would not be usable now due to lack of sight."
,,Brilliant History,5.0,,The tour of the Battlebox was an unexpected surprise. Tour guide Joanne did a marvellous job of bringing the fall of Singapore during WW2 to life. Would highly recommend this tour
,,Fantastic lesson in history,5.0,,"If you like knowing about world war 2 this should surely be in your list. It's a fantastic and interactive lesson in history. The guides take a lot of time to explain how things unfolded. You never really realise how time flies and before you know it, more than an hour has passed. The most eye catching thing about the tour are the mannequins, which look unbelievably realistic. I remember walking through some corners and passing a mannequin and wondering, ""Why isn't this person moving?"""
,,A hidden gem at Fort Canning!,5.0,,"We hit on this amazing tour at the Battlebox located at Fort Canning. The experience was very affordable and value for money as we get to learn about Singapore's history in World War II from the British rule to the Japanese Occupation to their independence.

The site was well maintained with a great storyline that is easy to follow. A small country who has come a long way from where they first started. A definite visit for travellers who want to understand about Singapore!"
,,Excellent museum,5.0,,We found this museum and tour to be very well presented both informative and interesting. The tour guide did an excellent job of conveying how it would have been for those soldiers enduring the conditions in the battlebox. We would recommend this tour for anyone interested in the history of Singapore and its place in the world.
,,Great history lesson,5.0,,"I have been looking at this tour for a few years and I finally got around to joining in on the tour. I like history and it was interesting to learn more about war history seen from the Singapore and Asia point of view. In Europe we tend to focus a lot on the European part of world war 2 but it was interesting to learn more about the events that took place before World war 2 and during the war. The tour takes you through the various rooms in the bunker and there is a mix of photos, texts, models, movies etc to give information and the tour guide was also knowledgeable, informative and funny. The only thing I can't really understand is why it is not allowed to take photos during the tour. If you like history, I can highly recommend taking this tour to learn more about the events that took place in Malaysia and Singapore during World war 2."
,,An incredible slice of history,5.0,,"My teenage son and I did the tour with an extremely knowledgeable guide. Steeped in history and a turning point of WW2; I almost felt like I was a part of those events at times as we ventured through the rooms.
Highly recommend. My son thoroughly enjoyed also.
Praise goes out to the people with enough foresight to preserve both the Battlebox and the pristine surroundings."
,,Spontaneous trip paid off,5.0,,"I was on a family trip in Singapore and on a free afternoon I decided to search Google maps for museums to visit. It was already 3pm when we found out about Battlebox and that the last tour admission was at 4pm. We decided to take our chances and rushed over via MRT, arriving at 3.45pm. The tour was already full but the tour guide was gracious to include us. The rooms in the bunker were decently mocked up, and in some rooms the guide gave us a few minutes to browse the maps and posters on the walls. The tour was well paced and the guide was engaging and interactive.

It was a fulfilling 1hour and 15min experience at SGD20, although I would have loved to hang around a bit longer in the bunker to let the story and experience sink in. Those who have at least read about WWII in history books would be able to appreciate the tour. Would recommend calling ahead to check and reserve spots in order to not be disappointed."
,,For war history lovers,5.0,,"Signed up via klook for the 1hr tour, conducted by Joanne. There is a bus stop in front of YMCA, followed by a short 5 minutes walk to the meet up point. I arrived at 9am so I have a bit of time to explore the fort a bit. Tour starts at 9;45 and there were only 3 other people, lucky to have a small group as there weren’t much time allowed in each of the exhibits inside. Do pay attention during the tour as there is a prize to win in the end!"
,,Excellent tour,5.0,,"After this 1 and half hour tour, it made me feel very emotional hearing what had happened here. Totally enjoyed this experience. Well done to our guide, sorry I forgot his name. Well worth doing this"
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,Visited with an old generation parent on wheelchair but were well received. The site was nicely preserved so we were able to experience how it was during those days in a real sense.
,,Great for all ages,5.0,,"A well presented tour which explains the surrender of Singapore, and how life was for the military who had to make this decision. The tour was appropriate for all ages. Definetly a must for those who have in interest in history of WWII."
,,time travel,5.0,,"a wonderful experience that brings you back to the moment when Singapore was about to fall. the experience is like riding on a time machine, the wartime atmosphere is well reproduced."
,,"Overrated tour,",2.0,,"We attended the 1 1/4 hour tour and frankly it was pretty poor. The reason you have a guide is there is very little to see inside. You get shown three videos which pads it out. Frankly it could be better if it was self guided with information boards and better displays.

It’s not really worth the money!"
,,A must-see in the park!,5.0,,"There is this beautiful park, well maintained (as all parks in Singapore) in the heart of the city. And there is a museum in the park: The battle box museum. Recommend the the guided tour! Don't do it on your own, you will miss a lot of interesting features of history! The tour itself last around an hour and is amazing! You will know a lot about the history of the British and Japan fight against each other in world war 2."
,,Interesting history and excellent guide,5.0,,"We had participated in the Time Traveller exhibition as part of the Bicentennial Experience and also spent a few hours at a Fort Siloso, so this tour was a great wrap up to our history of Singapore experiences. The tours are $20 and fill up quickly so if you would like to be part of the 9.45 am tour I recommend you book the day before or be at the information centre office at 9.30am sharp as they open. Highly recommend this tour."
,,Worth a visit for all the right reasons.,4.0,,"The Battle Box is informative and interesting, reminding us all of what Singapore went through when the British were forced to surrender the island over the the Japanese during the second world war.
Thoroughly enjoyable.
Getting to the Battle Box is easy:
Both Hop-On-Hop-Off buss services have stops at the base o the Fort Canning Hill next door to the Fort Canning MRT Metro Station. The Battle Box is located at the top of Fort Canning Hill. BUT, there are a series of outdoor escalators to take you to the top making it an easy walk for the able body person through the picturesque park."
,,Excellent tour,5.0,,The tour was very informative and our guide extremely knowledgeable. Very pleased that we took the tour.
,,Insightful Tour,5.0,,"This was a very insightful tour. All the things i wanted to know about how Singapore fell to the Japanese in the Second World War were answered. The Guide was extremely knowledgeable and i would recommend it to anyone visiting Singapore. As a bonus, Fort Canning is has beautiful gardens which are well worth a wander. it would appeal to a wide age of people."
,,History aplenty,5.0,,It was fascinating to be in the room where the decision was made to surrender Singapore in 1942. A friend recommended it. I’m glad we went.
,,Very interesting tour,5.0,,"Brought to life by our guide, we found out lots of information that we were not aware of. Good value and a must if you like WW2 history"
,,Battlebox,5.0,,"Awesome place with a great tour guide, great place to learn about the fall of Singapore unfortunately it was more directed for the USA market"
,,Excellent family activity.,5.0,,The whole family enjoyed this informative tour. Thoroughly recommend it and taking the time to explore the area.
,,Great historical walking tour,4.0,,The one hour walking tour was enjoyable. The guide was friendly and provided lots of valuable information. Would have loved to explore some of the other rooms though.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"I’m a singaporean, and I’ve visited battlebox twice, once in 20years back, and once recently. I’m still amazed by how well maintained and well conserved this place is! And the guide was awesome, he is knowledgeable!"
,,Compelling and Informative,5.0,,"A must destination for for those with an interest in the history of Singapore and the British Empire. The cost of the basic tour is $20 and takes about an hour. Accompanied by a knowledgable, engaging and friendly guide, visitors are taken on a room by room tour of the underground operational headquarters of the British Army and her allies, prior to their surrender to the invading Japanese forces in 1942. The tour includes photographic displays, artefacts, short films and life like models of the main participants in the fateful decision to surrender. It is well worth the visit and is easily accessible from Dhoby Ghaut Metro Station. From there, it’s a short uphill walk to the Battlebox. If it’s wet, take a short, inexpensive taxi ride. The tour concludes with a little quiz question. There is a prize too."
,,Excellent Battlebox,5.0,,This is a must see attraction for those interested in world history and it’s an excellent insight into how and why the British lost their stronghold in Asia. A very interesting tour.
,,One of the best place to learn WWII history of Singapore,5.0,,This historical site gave us an immersive feeling of the battle of Singapore. The wax figures truly recreated some important scenes in this command center. Through the guided tour we learnt the functionalities of this command center and the progress throughout the Battle of Singapore. Unfortunately photo taking was not allowed in the tour but there were some postcards and souvenirs worth buying.
,,Really interesting hour and a bit and cool 😎,5.0,,The thing that really lifts this tour to top level is the quality of the tour guide and she was 10/10
,,History recreated - Not to be missed,5.0,,"We have recently enjoyed a great stay in Singapore, topped off by this great historical re creation of the Surrender of Singapore to the Japanese. Through a very informative narrative delivered by a wonderful tour guide, we were taken back in time to the war years war maps photographs military personal ( dummies) creating the necessary intense atmosphere of the difficult times..
Congratulations for a great presentation which is highly recommended for all ages."
,,Great place to visit whilst in Singapore,5.0,,"Having visited some of the gardens, we decided to venture to Fort Canning Park and take a tour of the Battlebox.
We weren’t quite sure what to expect but we were so glad we did! The guide was excellent and the tour was interesting and informative - pitched at just the right level for holiday makers and history buffs alike.
Incredible place loving looked after by the team, would highly recommend a visit."
,,For history buffs,5.0,,Singapore's hidden treasure. recommended by one of the airline hosts. Details the little talked about attack by the Japanese in WW2 and takes you to the end of the war.
,,Informative,4.0,,We (family of four with two teens) did this tour recently. Informative and knowledgeable commentary and good way to see the inside of the bunker and learn about the days immediately before the surrender of British forces to the Japanese in WW2.
,,WW2 History - Japanese Invasion of Singapore,5.0,,"We have visited Singapore many times and are very interested in WW2 history particularly War in the Pacific. This excellent tour needs to be booked in advance . Tour is takes place in Fort Canning which was the headquarters of the British Army until the invasion by the Japanese. It consists of underground bunkers. The Singaporean guide was excellent, well worth a visit."
,,Well worth the visit.,5.0,,Excellent curation of a significant event in Sinapore's modern history - the staff and our particular guide were excellent and very knowledgeable
,,WW2 interest,5.0,,For a blunt perspective of the military decisions made in 1941-42 take this tour. Certainly makes you think outside of general historical reporting.
,,Great Historical Tour,5.0,,A really interesting tour which explains the fall of Singapore. Located in a bunker in Fort Canning Park. A great pick for a hot or wet day. Reminiscent of the War Room in London.
,,Very moving,5.0,,This is a wonderful tour and very moving. It's incredible what these soldiers went through — 300 or more officers were crammed into these few rooms when the Japanese army invaded the island in WWII.
,,Interesting tour,5.0,,This tour is well organised and full of interesting history facts about the day the British surrendered to Japan in WW2. It is a must do for sure.
,,Battlebox,4.0,,Really interesting Museum. Great guide who was really knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the Battlebox and its history. The recreations in each room of the activities that occurred were well done and provided a real sense of what went on in the Batlebox. A treat for anyone interested in second world war history.
,,Amazing insite,5.0,,Insight into a sad part of history. The politics around surrender and fear of what was to come. Amazing to think how fat technology has come since
,,War,5.0,,Excellent and well preserved to get a feeling of how bad war is and to experience the close and dark underground they had to work in. The original film footage was also very informing and unedited.
,,Battlebox Tour,5.0,,Excellent tour Tour guide was very informative and very passionate in her telling of the events that happen at this historical site. This a must see tour when visiting Singapore.
,,A Wonderful Experience,5.0,,"A must do in Singapore. This is an amazing story about the painful surrender of the British forces in WW2. The tour is very educating and emotional.

,,Very informative tour,5.0,,Very informative and very worthwhile. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in military history or the history of Singapore.

,,Fascinating tour and knowledgeable guide,5.0,,"Purchased tickets to this tour on a whim and am so glad my partner and I went. Tour guide was very knowledgable and presented the information in a very clear and concise way.

This tour really helped me develop an understanding of the events that led up to Singapore's surrender - a topic I really should have known more about given its implications for Asia Pac at the time!

Fantastic for any one interested in WWII history in Singapore, or just an interest in what an underground bunker would look like (welcome respite for those struggling with the heat!)."
,,Hidden treasure-trove.,5.0,,"Stumbled across the Battlebox tour accidentally. Superb historical account, in the place where it actually happened. The tour corrects the appalling inaccuracies of history and shows the truth about the fall of Singapore and the Far-East."
,,"Of Graves,Guns and Battles walking tour of Battlebox and Fort Canning Hill",5.0,,Excellent walking tour of Fort Canning Hill and the underground Battlebox WW2 command center. Our guide Helena was extremely enthusiastic and knowledgeable which added immeasurably to the enjoyment of our experience. Excellent models and audio-visual presentations.

,,Great place,5.0,,Fantastic tour which was very informative I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Singapore x
,,Battlebox Visit,4.0,,Walk through history - how difficult it must have been in such confined quarters - the mannequins brought to life the realty of the situation

,,Fantastic,4.0,,"If you like military history then this is a must do whilst in Singapore, if you are not mad on history, then it is still highly recommended. It is hard to believe on the tour you are standing in rooms where decisions were made which affected so many people and a nation. The events of the time were brought to life by an excellent guide who was very knowledgeable and spoke and presented the history exceptionally well. There were good short films to reinforce the facts."
,,Weekend jaunt,5.0,,a bit eerie to be inside this place. i felt as if the statues would come alive which is silly. however its a place worth visiting.
,,A Must Do,5.0,,"This is a must see in Singapore.

Located at fort canning park.

$20 per adult goes for 1hour 15 minutes with a guide.

It tell the story of the last few days of ww2 and the fall of Singapore.

Only down part you can take pics inside."
,,Battlebox Tour at Fort Canning,5.0,,A very informative tour about Singapore during WWII. Would highly recommend this tour if you are a history fan!
,,Very informative,5.0,,I’m a Singaporean with 10 year old boy and left the tour having a more in-depth understanding of Singapore history. Strongly recommend for both Singaporeans and tourists who are interested in history specifically WW2 in Singapore. The tour guide is knowledgeable and the pace is just right. We came on weekdays afternoon and there were only 6 people.
,,History,5.0,,"A wonderful experience with such a brilliant guide, there is so much to learn in wonderful gardens ,"
,,Battle Box Guided tour.,5.0,,An excellent tour to learn about the fall of Singapore in 1942.The audio visual films were excellent and to be able to visit the rooms and see the displays gave you dome idea of what it would have been like living and working underground during that time.
,,Good tour,5.0,,"Good tour in a well-developed historical site, knowledgeable and clear guide. Lots of good replica and amazing story-telling. Well worth the money."
,,"Interesting Tour, Excellent Guides",5.0,,"We visited the Battlebox during our recent stay in Singapore. It provided us with great information and insights into the second world war as it impacted Singapore and its people. The guides were well informed and provided a high level of information during the tour. Easily accessed by train, be prepared for a short walk uphill."
,,Good,4.0,,"It was educational, informative & interesting. Guides were well informed. Detailed explanation combined with interesting and very real looking sculptures depicting the scenario at the time of war"
,,Really Interesting and Worth a Visit,5.0,,"Really enjoyed my visit to this - note you can only visit by tour and the tours get booked up, so plan to book yourself on the tour before you visit the rest of Fort Canning or the National Museum. The tour was very good though, really well informed and just enough to take in. Definitely brings to life what it must have been like at the fall of Singapore for the British military confined to this bunker. Very well done, good quality, tour led by the very charming Chin Han - thank you!"
,,1.5hr Battlebox Tour,5.0,,"Thoroughly enjoyed the 1.5hr tour. Joanne was an exceptional guide and provided loads to information. I am not a history buff but tagged along with my husband yet it ended up being a fantastic tour that I enjoyed and would recommend to anyone,"
,,Tourism,5.0,,Visit to Battlebox during our holiday to Singapore- very enlightening and would recommend. Worth a visit.
,,"Great tour, although I question the guided part",5.0,,"This was a guided tour in the underground bunker with 7 others. I’m not absolutely sure why it’s guided, as there seemed to be plenty to read and see (which we didn't always get a chance to fully read), and the a/v elements filled in the gaps.

Nevertheless it was a pleasant tour despite the subject matter. It added another layer of detail on the short war experience of Singapore on 8 Feb, 1942 to a week after that. We saw the room where Percival apparently capitulated although he supposedly went into that room looking for ideas on how to counter-attack. If our guide was to be believed, it was the pesky Aussies in the room who wanted to wave the white flag and who am I to doubt her.

Overall, a very good experience, but like I said, I think I would have preferred a guideless tour, so I could explore by myself a little more."
,,Battlebox 2 1/2 hour tour,4.0,,"Very informative tour, not just of WWII history but of earlier history for this ancient, important place, thank Jo. We were lucky enough to be the only ones, so a great experience for us, if a little wet to begin with, thanks to Singapore cloud burst! More detail than we had known about fall of Singapore and interesting from an Asian perspective not just Aussie/England view. Highly recommended."
,,Well organised tour,4.0,,The visit to the WW2 command bunker is only possible by guided tour. The guide was knowledgeable and gave a good explanation about the location and the events surrounding the Battle for Singapore. It's a shame that no photos can be taken.
,,Good experience,4.0,,"Very good to learn/ be reminded of the terrible WW2 time for Singapore. Interesting to walk the underground rooms and tunnels set up with models and memorabilia.
Guide very knowledgeable, a couple of short historical films.
Downs: 30 people on tour;better if limited to 20. A bit quick, finished in about 60 mins rather than 75 and I felt rushed through rooms.
Leave time to look around Fort Canning Park"
,,Living history.,5.0,,"A well organised and informative museum. The displays and the guided tour are well researched and presented. The dramatic events of the British surrender to the Japanese invaders in 1942 are vividly brought to life.
This is a must visit destination to any one interested in the history of Singapore and World War 2"
,,An unexpected Gem,5.0,,"So important to know history. Wonderfully presented for the entire family. Exciting to actually enter the ""Battlebox"". Very well restored. Our guide was very informative."
,,Amazing tour and amazing tour guide,5.0,,This was hands down our highlight in our Singapore trip; it was an eye opening tour with a very knowledgeable and well presented tour guide. She was tiny but her voice was loud and she had extremely good pacing throughout. The ticket counter staff was also extremely helpful and engaged in conversation with us on his recommendations of a typical Singaporean breakfast while we waited for the tour to begin. We're not history buffs but we certainly became extremely interested after this tour after learning so much. Definitely make some time to visit this. Very highly recommended experience.
,,Excellent look into history,5.0,,We learnt so much during our visit to the Battlebox. A piece of history we knew very little about. Well explained from an excellent guide.
,,"Excellent, informative tour",5.0,,"Such an interesting guided tour of this underground bunker. Our tour guide was extremely knowledgable, clear and concise. So glad we decided to do this tour it was fascinating."
,,Fascinating Place -- My 11yo son said he enjoyed this more than Universal Studios,5.0,,"This was one of the best things my 11yo son and I did on our trip to Singapore, including a million rides at Universal. Granted, we were predisposed because of more than a passing interest in military history, and I also had a Great Uncle who was an Australian POW at Changi. We got so much out of it and the context of the Japanese advance into SE Asia (talk about a Blitzkreig - it only took 55 days!) and the Fall of Singapore really came together for us. The tour guide (I've forgotten her name) was amazing - so friendly and enthusiastic, and she made it come alive. Honestly, if you like a good story, the arc of General Percival's wartime tale is fascinating. My son paid extra attention to everything, memorising all the details as we went, because the tour guide said there'd be a quiz at the end! He knew the answer and his hand shot up, but unfortunately for him another kid was picked to answer first and got it right. The prize was a reproduction of the Japanese surrender document (another fascinating story in itself) - my son bought a copy with his own money, and I noticed it's now sitting proudly above his bed. We also enjoyed the lush grounds, where it would have been nice just to walk around there admiring the greenery. Just outside the Battlebox entrance is a frangipani tree with flowers in a gorgeous shade I'd never seen before -- solid butter yellow."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"We were recommended Battlebox and were not disappointed! It was fantastic. The guide was very informative and was a great experience. Whether your a history enthusiast or not, this is well worth a visit."
,,Battlebox tour,5.0,,"This was a fascinating visit, and very much brought to life for us the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese. The guide, whose own parents lived through the occupation ,was well informed and interesting. It was acknowledged that although there was ultimately little choice, the decision makers, symbolised by chillingly life- like models seated round the table in earnest discussion, had the burden of this on their shoulders for the rest of their lives. It was inconceivable to imagine so many soldiers cramped together in the dank, poorly ventilated accommodation. The rooms and labrynthine passages inside the carefully concealed building had thick walls to protect the accommodation from an assault but there were few toilet facilities and comforts . Probably one of the most realistic and evocative wartime museums I have experienced."
,,Well worth it,5.0,,Very enjoyable and interesting tour.....Joanne our tour guide really knew her stuff and was very knowledgeable and informative ......Many thanks.
,,A great view into Singapores history,5.0,,"As Germans we didn't know so much about the Asian part of WWII. We didn't know, that Britisch troups had to surrender. So we really were surprised about the great and very engaged introduction, we got from the guide at Battle Box. Questions were answered completely and professionaly, which showed a solid knowledge of this part of history. Additional video spots completed this all and gave a good overview to the historical background. It was also amazing, that the dedication was given to the'bave men' - british soldiers - who handled this critical situation in a very good and moderate way. It is great to see, how the people of Singapore include these events as an integral part of their own history. This fits to the care with that architecture of British origin is kept and maintained in the city of Singapure.without withholding the new things, which point into future. That's what makes me liking Singapore so much. The Battle Box is part of this great tradition!

,,Informative and thought provoking,4.0,,"Well presented WWII history tour, our guide was pleasant and easy to listen to. Very thought provoking when hearing of the situation the Allied Forces were under .

,,Little known gem,5.0,,"Whilst have been to Singapore a number of the times over the past 5 years, I hadn't heard about this historic site. Well worth a visit."
,,WWII History Comes to Life,4.0,,"The Battlebox at Fort Canning is an excellent tour for anyone who, like me, is fascinated by WWII history. The guide (Nancy in my case) was extremely informative and, since she had a family connection to the period, very passionate.
The dioramas in the Battlebox rooms were excellent and really made you feel a part of proceedings. The fact that they accurately represented the real people was also great. The films from the time shown in the Battlebox rooms were also really good and quite moving.
Lastly, the fact that the Battlebox is air-conditioned is a Godsend in Singapore's heat.
I highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Singapore."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Thoroughly enjoyed this insight into Singapore's WWII history. Just the right amount of detail and so intriguing to see into the bunker and imagine life down there.

,,Battle box,5.0,,Wonderful experience and so very interesting and not only educational. Our guide was so knowledgeable and made it come alive.

,,Outstanding!!!,5.0,,Captivating!! Knowledgeable!! Wonderful experience. Thank you!! We both learnt so much and enjoyed the morning of educational tourism. Brilliant!
,,Fort Canning Museum Singapore,5.0,,Very interesting tour with knowledgeable guide. Set into a beautiful garden environment it’s a trip back to the dark days of WW2 when Singapore was overrun and captured by the Imperial Japanese Army. Well run and very informative
,,You made a defeat look like a success,4.0,,Questions that remain: - How was it to live under Japanese rule? - How did the Singaporeans feel about the situation (not the colonists)? - What impact has the British and Japanese rule meant for Singapore today?
,,Worthwhile tour,5.0,,"Joanne, our guide was very knowledgable and thourough in her presentation of the Battlebox experience. This gave a great balanced overview of the events prior to and after the surrender of Singapore. The props etc are very well done and give a vivid portrayal of events. We would reccomend it."
,,History happened here,5.0,,This was a very interesting and informative tour going inside the WW2 command centre. The guide was excellent in explaining the events that happened during the Battle of Singapore and especially the days leading up to its surrender
,,Interesting Tour,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the tour, which lasts for a little over one hour. Our guide was very well spoken and knowledgeable, imparting quite a bit of history as we toured the Battlebox."
,,Battlebox,5.0,,Excellent place for people that enjoy history. Friendly staff and tour guide. Very informative and interesting.
,,Tour of the Battle Box,5.0,,The tour guide was very knowledgeable and gave a very good presentation on the events relavent to the Battle Box. The structure itself was fascinating!
,,A throwback to heroism in adversity,5.0,,"Dian our guide had me spellbound in the one hour and 15 minutes she took us around the Battlebox. It is well preserved, well presented and still holds its old world air about it. The various short films presented well the fall of Singapore."
,,Interesting experience.,4.0,,"We arrived early afternoon and booked for the 4pm guided tour. Joanne , our guide was very informative and made the tour memorable. Would highly recommend a visit if you have time in Singapore. Thank you."
,,Well worth the time (and money),5.0,,"This is the fourth time that I visited Singapore, but the first time that I visited ""The Battlebox"". Very well organized and narrated. The guild is highly professional both in her presentation skills and being highly informative. It's really a time capsule, and created a chance for us to travel back to the past. A very good place to have my kid educated interactively. Lest we forget."
,,Fun day out,5.0,,"I took my dad to the Battlebox when he was recently visiting me in Singapore. He is a real WWII history buff, so it wasn't like he learned anything new, but he really enjoyed the tour and seeing something different. I however, did learn lots of things and enjoyed it as well. Our tour guide was very friendly and helpful."
,,Confronting interaction with the reality of war,5.0,,What an amazing experience. You are venturing through the `battlebox' operations centre of the Malaya High Command more or less as it was during WW2 and getting a close-up view of how the battle of Singapore unfolded (or unravelled). The displays and Av are fantastic and are realistic and authentic and our tour guide was absolutety first class. This is a must visit if you have the time.
,,Well worth the time and the money,5.0,,"Witness a major event in the fall of the British Empire—the surrender of the British army in Singapore during WWII. A tour of the Battle Box recalls the mix of stupidity, boldness, and tragedy as the Japanese commander bluffs the ill-assorted bunch of Allied top-brass and overwhelms the numerically superior force, resulting in thousands of young men and women spending wasted years in prison camps and the local inhabitants suffer years of hardship.
The tour was led by a dynamic and well-informed young woman historian who made the events come alive and we visitors were confronted by the final soul-destroying decision facing the British commander."
,,Very Interesting,5.0,,A good piece of history. This is the old command center during the battle of Singapore during World War II. The staff was well informed and able to answer all our questions.
,,Battlebox Tour,5.0,,Very interesting & informative tour and the condition of area is very well kept. Only advice I would give is confirm location before visiting as Fort Canning Hotel area is best way to access tour
,,Michael Bevan,5.0,,A wonderful experience which should be a must whilst visiting Singapore. Our guide spoke clearly and was knowledgeable on the historical aspect of the battlebox. A great tour
,,Excellent and most informative,5.0,,"On a hot sticky day in Canning Park, this is an excellent and informative visit. It was certainly one of the highlights of our time in Singapore - it's an easy place to have highlights - but I think this would be especially interesting to British visitors as sunset began to descend upon the Empire which 'like all proud empires passed away' (Ellerton)."
,,A really well thought out and delivered tour,5.0,,"This was a really informative and interesting tour, my husband loves these kind of tours and museum/historical site, me, I often find then dry and rather dull, he loves history I’m more arts and crafts. However I found this tour to be really interesting with a great explanation of the battle box, the history the events that lead to its significant role in British military history and events that lead to the fall of Singapore to the Japanese. Using lots of different mediums and walking you through each of the rooms and the different role it had in a military command post, they have recreated a unique site. You have to take the tour, (check website for times) and photos aren’t allowed inside, but it’s worth the time to visit, the guide is a young historian who delivers the information with elegance and passion. Fort canning is a great place to walk around and the hill is the national museum of Singapore and a short walk to Raffles! If you like military history and or smaller less
Obvious attractions then this is a must do, even for those of you who are museum shy ☺️"
,,Well worth the fee,4.0,,"We learned a lot during our 80 minute tour. I had done some reading, but what our guide told us added to what I had learned and clarified other things.

The displays were excellent, especially the ones with the wax figures.

The signage, and the explanations from our guide, clearly laid out the timeline of the battle for Singapore.

Guided tours only.

No photos allowed inside."
,,"Very educational, but maybe not for kids",5.0,,"We had a great time joining the guided tour. Our initial plan is to join the 1.30pm one, but it was full when we got there (apparently this is their most popular slot). We got Dian as our tour guide, she is very charismatic and very good at giving explanations. Personally we think that the whole experience was very educational and insightful, but because of the heavy themes being discussed, I do not think it would be suitable for kids (they may find it boring-- or interesting, depending on how keen they are to learn about history)."
,,Fascinating and a must see,5.0,,"Anyone visiting Singapore, and wishing to understand its history, should definitely visit the Battlebox in Fort Canning Park. The tour lasts an hour and a half but it is crammed with interesting facts, well presented by an extremely informative guide. The exhibitions, photos and videos are fascinating. The guide was so good that I felt the devastation when Percival, the British Commanding Officer finally had to surrender Singapore to the invading Japanese forces. The booking office is air-conditioned, with a selection of souvenirs to purchase plus a cabinet of drinks to buy. My husband loved the quiz at the end as he won it!! Highly highly recommended."
,,Critical WW2 visit for all travelers wanting to know history of this island,4.0,,The most important historical event in Singapore's modern history as it creates the Physc of how SG thinks about defense post Britain's time and in its independence
,,Great,5.0,,Great place to visit. It looks very touristic but the visit is made by an historian and the explanations are interesting. The videos shown are good and the site is beautifully preserved or recreated. Definitely worth a visit if you want to understand the Agni tide of the British defeat in 1942.
,,WW2 history at its best.,5.0,,If you are interested in history of WW2 and the fall of Singapore this is a must see museum. Our guide was interesting and knowledgeable. The Battlebox was only rediscovered in the 1990’s so many of the props (communication hardware etc) is not original as the real material was destroyed or looted at the end of the war. This does not distract from the exhibit at all. Just to be in the place where the original decision to surrender is fascinating in itself. Thoroughly recommend a visit.
,,Great experience,5.0,,Our tour guide Helena had lots of information throughout the tour. Battlebox rooms and exhibits were set up well and gave a good insight as to what things would of been like back then. Overall the tour was very impressive and was worth the price
,,Learn of the biggest capitulation in UK military history,5.0,,This is a must do if you're in Singapore and/or you're interested in history. Guides were very friendly and knowledgeable. Fascinating to learn of the British surrender to the Japanese and the reasons why.
,,Insight into a disaster,5.0,,A must visit if you have any military bend and the tour we had was provided by a very competent guide. A combination of verbal interpretation of each of the individual rooms purpose in the complex mixed with 5 minute video's giving a broader view and historic footage that knits it into a complete package.
,,Really interesting: not to be missed,5.0,,If you are interested in the second world war and the surrender of the British to Japan then this is a must. The Battlebox is the bunker where the Brtis had their HQ during the siege of Singapore. It is a guided tour and the guide and the displays are very informative. Advance booking by email is required. Thoroughly recommended and one of the best things we did in Singapore.
,,Battle box review,4.0,,"Great insightful tour of Singapore's WW2 history. good use of presenter, audio-visual and practical displays to take us on the journey."
,,History,5.0,,A very humble experience seeing history of The Fall of Singapore '42. Guide was very experienced and enjoyable to listen to.
,,Wonderful history lesson,5.0,,This place was a big surprise. Our guide Matthew was very knowledgeable sharing stories of the bunker and WW2. The tour cost S$20 which we felt was great value given the quality of the tour we were on. The bunker has been restored well. The dioramas using models of significant war personnel help to tell the story of the surrender of Singapore. The shop where you buy tickets is stocked with very interesting books full of war stories related to the surrender and the Battlebox. Highly recommend this tour if you are interested in War history.
,,A must-visit to have an insight of 1940s Singapore,5.0,,"Our guide Dian is very eloquent and knowledgeable on the history behind this tour. She is friendly and seems passionate in what she does.
The tour is carried out in a small group and adequate amount of time is allocated in each room for us to go through the explanations and artefacts."
,,Very interesting visit,4.0,,"I think your tour is very interesting if you are interested in history, as I am, but I think is too long for people who is not. The guide is very good because she knows every detail about this topic but it seems not to be a tour for everybody for, as I mentioned above, it is focused on people very very interested on Singapore history."
,,Great History Lesson,5.0,,"My husband and I took our 8 year old Grandson to the Battlebox and were unsure on how interested he would be. He loved it! We have been back in Australia for two days now and he is still telling everyone what he learnt about the battle of Singapore. A great history lesson that everyone should be educated on, regardless of age."
,,The top trip in Singapore.,5.0,,"Very impressed by this display. The young lady who took us on the tour really knew what it was all about. She spoke very well and with intimate knowledge of the subject.
I was also surprised how many of the local school children were touring the site. Wonderful to know that the ""Fall of Singapore"" is not forgotten here, and the men who died at Changi are not forgotten."
,,A great tour - must do!,5.0,,Third time to Singapore and curiosity got the better of me so went and did the tour with17yo son. Very informative and a great tour guide. Worth the effort and need to pre-book.
,,Excellent tour,5.0,,"This is an excellent tour of an important historical Singapore site. They don’t take online bookings so make sure you turn up a good 20 minutes early. We arrived in a huge rain storm and they very kindly opened the doors early. The site is fascinating and the tour guide was very interesting and informative. There were a lot of children on our tour (including our own) who were all very well behaved, but it’s really not suitable for under sevens, as the guide suggests. After the tour it is a lovely walk back down the hill to the Singapore national museum."
,,Fabulous & informative,5.0,,"Even if you are not a history buff you'll find this tour pretty interesting. It's well laid out, and tells a good story about the last days of WW2 before Singapore surrendered to the Japanese, and what led to that decision being mad. Walk through the bunker and see where it all happened... great commentary from an animated tour guide was very good. Highly recommend this for anyone over the age of 12."
,,"Interesting WW2 museum, good guide",3.0,,"We enjoyed our tour and appreciated our enthusiastic and knowledgeable guide. In Australia we always hear about the Fall of Singapore from a biased, anglo-centric viewpoint, so it was good to hear about it from a local. Got a very different story about Australia's involvement than we have heard before. I liked that there were so many of the original fittings left. Didn't like not being allowed to take any photos. I can understand it would slow down the tour a bit, but we would have liked to take just a couple as reminders of our visit. Maybe have a couple of short stops to allow photos.and ban for the remainder of the tour? I"
,,"Fascinating, punchy and enjoyable",5.0,,"Didn’t really know what to expect from this tour today but thoroughly enjoyed it and the time flew by. Joanne was a first class presenter. Professional, clear and good pace. Fascinating insight into a key part of WW2. Not to be missed."
,,So this is where it happened...,5.0,,"The first time we visited the Battle Box there was an animatronics display which impressed us greatly. However, it has since been revamped and is much better! Our guide (Joanne) was very knowledgeable and able to impart the horror of the things that unfolded in Singapore while the Allies attempted to stem the Japanese invasion. They had no chance with heavy equipment ill-suited to jungle warfare and few supplies or backup. It was interesting to learn of the impact some of the personalities had on Gen. Percival's decision; I am unsure what else he could have done - caught between a rock and a hard place.
There are many photos and artefacts, documents and a documentary.
Well worth a visit and a chance to absorb a bit of history which, after all, happened less than 100 years ago."
,,Informative and interesting,5.0,,"It was quite interesting to learn more about Singapore history. My mother and I did the the 2 and half hour tour. Wina was our guide. She was really charismatic, funny, considerate and informative."
,,Realistic History,5.0,,A wonderful relic of WW2 with a complete and thorough presentation from our group guide. Explaining what happened during the Japanese invasion of Singapore and the reasons that led to the British surrendering at the time. Highly recommended.
,,Fantastic explanation of WW2 in Singapore and Pacific,5.0,,"Our guide was very knowledgeable and gave us a fantastic and clear explanation of what was happening in the region and Singapore, as well as the impact of the fall of Singapore on the British Empire. We went with our 10 year old daughter and we all really enjoyed it."
,,Interesting History lesson,4.0,,This is worth a visit to see some of Singapore's War history which is little known to most. You descend into the original bunker and are guided through some of the many rooms of this structure to discover what happened on the last days before the Japanese took over Singapore in WW II. Some rooms are set up with manikins in the likeness of the actual soldiers from that period and the displays are very good. The tour guide explains what took place and is very knowledgable.
,,A must visit. Very clear narrative of the events leading into and the eventual fall of Singapore,5.0,,"A very well planned and delivered 1 and 1/4 hour tour. Simple to get to and participate in as well.

Prices at $S20 for adults, the Battle Box tour will captivate and takes you back to the 100 days leading into and ultimately the fall of Singapore.

Quite a detailed tour with a smart mixture of tour guide, film and wall / recreated displays.

A must visit for any person interested in military history and for those that are not, an easy opportunity to get you going.

Charming tour guides and small tour groups in well air conditioned bunkers make the tour a real must and best such display I have ever visited.

Easy and well informed. Please try. Easy to get to."
,,An evocative step back in time,5.0,,If you are interested in ww2 history the Battlebox will bring alive one of great tragedies of that conflict. Well worth a visit.
,,Great experience,4.0,,"Dropped by after visit to national Museum - Informative and detailed look at this interesting period...which has had lifelong ramifications for the entire region.

This tour cannot be done without a guide so be prepared to pay the $20 SG entry.

I suggest visiting the National Museum before hand (5 minutes walk away) to complement this tour."
,,fascinating,5.0,,"From the minute I walked into the office and booked my ticket , everything went like clockwork. The tour was started on time, the guide was very good, his language was clear and not rushed but he took us around the venue in a timely manner.
You all should be so proud of the tour you present.
One tip- you cant tell people how many characters the tips should be when they are giving up their time and feedback for free."
,,Battle box must do venue,5.0,,Fantastic tour guide was informative and learnt about history . This is must do event on any hoilday to singapore and value for money
,,Hidden Treasure,5.0,,"For those interested in WW2 history , this is a tour not to be missed.Our guide on this 1.5 hr tour was
excellent as we moved around this underground allied command centre - one of the most significant decisions of WW2 was made in this bunker by Arthur Percival , British commander in Malaya & Singapore - the decision to surrender to the invading Japanese forces.
One of the highlights of our trip to Singapore"
,,Good Tour if you are interested in war history,5.0,,"A very comprehensive tour of the 'Bunker' used by British Commanders just prior to surrender to Japanese. Some very realistic mannequins in battledress keeping an eye on the tour party!
Guide was very knowledgeable and had an easy presentation manner.
Also the 'end story' has nice twist of fate."
,,Excellent visitor experience,5.0,,"The Battlebox is an excellent museum and definitely worth visiting. It would be a good idea though, to plan your walking route to the museum as it can involve a lot of stairs and steepish hills."
,,Nice visit,4.0,,Professional tour guide with meaningful information. Give me a better understanding of world war 2 in Singapore.
,,It was OK,3.0,,"An general look at the fall of Singapore under the Japanese in WW2, if a little static and corny. The group was quite large so it was difficult to see some of the story boards and there really wasn't a lot that was of great interest on offer.- mainly large empty rooms where the guide told us what would have happened in there. Not much atmosphere or attempt to recreate the vibe."
,,Excellent all round,5.0,,"My wife and I enjoyed this tour immensely. The guide was very knowledgeable (ex-military), polite and helpful.

The site itself was well presented with videos and the guides commentary to set the scene and explain how the Battlebox was used, its limitations and ultimate fate. There were plenty of supporting posters and artefacts but sadly not enough time to absorb them all. The tour proceeds efficiently as they have several groups to move through each day. As it is a private museum, not Government funded, they do not allow photographs.

All in all, an excellent way to learn about this critical piece of WWII history."
,,Battle Box,5.0,,It was an informative and interesting place to visit. The guide had a wonderful knowledge of the events that took place.
,,Must do while in Singapore,5.0,,Extremely interesting history tour of Singapore during WW2 Being in the Battlebox where decisions were made to surrender Singapore to the Japanese
,,Very interesting piece of Singapore WW2 history,5.0,,"The guided tour of the Second World War command facilities was extremely interesting and informative. Well worth a visit if you are interested in history, particularly military."
,,Battlebox visit in March 2019,5.0,,Very interesting and informative. Staff knowledgeable and helpful. Reasonably priced at around £10 Well worth a visit for any WW2 buffs.
,,Bittersweet Battlebox memories,5.0,,I have been involved with travel and tourism in Ireland for 58 years and I have to say that the tour and particularly the female guide were first class. We also enjoyed the park and grounds after our tour.
,,History explained,5.0,,We had an extremely informative visit to this site. Our guide was very knowledgeable and gave us a thorough history lesson of the Battlebox. Such an amazing insight to the turbulent times experienced by the defending armies and the invading forces.
,,My parents told us to go and I’m so glad we went!,5.0,,It was incredibly interesting and I recommend it to everyone. I wasn’t feeling well and so I didn’t want to go but I had a great time and really loved the experience - despite how I was feeling!
,,A must see,5.0,,"This is a must see while in Singapore. Our guide was fantastic, a young lady who explained things simply but well. So much history there. This was the best thing we saw this trip to Singapore. We walked to the Park, very easy to get to. We were early so had a lovely walk around before our tour started. Would highly recommend"
,,The battle is not lost............,5.0,,What a fantastic WW2 relic. Its so important that the truth be told. Cudos to those who work hard to preserve this artefact. If only the Battlebox had a more visible public entity.
,,Too quick,4.0,,The display and information offered by our tour was amazing The guide very knowledgeable. However I found myself too rushed to be able to absorb the information. I thought ok Ill photograph some wall displays to read later but that was not allowed so I absorbed as much as I could but left feeling I had not been allowed the opportunity to get it all.
,,Battlebox tour,5.0,,Excellent guided tour. Interesting site to visit. A good selection of relevant books were available at the gift shop.
,,Excellent Tour. Highly Recommended.,5.0,,"Forget boring museums. A guided tour of the Battlebox is a must for visitors to Singapore, where knowledgeable guides explain the story of the WW2 battle and subsequent surrender of the city state to invading Japanese forces. We were lucky enough to be guided by Joanne, whose enthusiasm for history shone through. She brought the Battlebox to life for us and we were so glad we came.

It's adviseable to check the website for opeing times and to book to avoid disappointment, as tours are limited to enable groups to fit within the confines of this old command centre.

Nearest MTRs are Fort Canning Park or Dhoby Ghaut."
,,Amazing piece of history,5.0,,"I was very impressed with this tour. I am not usually a fan of museums, but this was an eye-opening experience and not your average museum. Highly recommend this tour."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"we asked on our cruise ship how to get here and no-one had heard of it what a shame , this place is brilliant, i think it wise to pre book your tour as from our experience it can get very full and they only like to take so many on the tour so that everyone can fit into the rooms, our guide was extremely informative -Chin Han, its a must visit. the tour informs you of the surrender to the Japanese, how life was inside the underground bunker , it is so interesting , you cant take pictures inside , but thats a good thing because you need to be listening and taking it all in its not to be missed, would go again"
,,Fantastic Explanation and Visit,5.0,,"This trip to Battlebox is highly recommended as it explains the overall strategy and reasoning for the surrender of Singapore.

The visit involves an in-depth tour of the underground bunker used as the command post in the second world war, led by a local guide with excellent English skills and a deep understanding of the subject.

Canning Park, where Battlebox is situated is also a very nice park to visit with several interesting areas in its own right.

Well worth a visit for anyone interested in WWII history or the history of Singapore."
,,Interesting view of WWII in Singapore,4.0,,"The Battlebox provides a good overview of the early days of World War II in the Pacific Theater with an emphasis on the decision to surrender Singapore. The tour is valuable both to the more casual tourist as well as history buffs. The tour is well led by an informed guide and is the right length. Check in occurs at the adjacent shop and is followed by a short walk to the Battlebox and an introduction outside. Please note that pictures in the Battlebox are not allowed.

While waiting for the tour to start you can walk around the grounds of the park, but there are not many dining options (other than the Fort Canning Hotel), so plan to eat before heading to the park or after the tour."
,,Informative,5.0,,"As a Westerner, we don't hear too much about the effects of WW2 on small Asian nations like Singapore. This tour really helps understand how devastating the Japanese occupation was and how the allies let the people of Asia down."
,,Really interesting and excellent guide,5.0,,We really enjoyed the Battlebox guided tour. It was very interesting with plenty of information and it wasn't boring at all. The guide (Joanne) was excellent giving loads of information but not so fast that we couldn't take it in. I would recommend it!
,,Excellent insight to Singapore history,5.0,,"This is a great insight to some recent history of Singapore. It gives a very good understanding of the lead up to the surrender of Singapore and an insight into the reasons behind this decision. It only takes 1.5-2 hours and is easily accessible from Dhoby Ghaut MRT station. Joanne was our guide and she was very passionate and knowledgable about the events.
Definitely worth doing."
,,Had a fascinating 1 hour 15 minute tour,5.0,,In my two day stay in Singapore this was the best. If you have any interest in history or particularly military history and WWII then this is a must. Our tour guide was fantastic. She was warm and inclusive and same time so interesting to listen to as we walked around the bunker in different rooms learning of the events which took place and how the men lived and worked in such conditions.
,,Very informative,5.0,,Tour with Matthew this morning was really interesting. Tour was varied with several short film clips during the guided tour which included realistic modeling of command in the battle box.
,,GUIDED TOUR HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,5.0,,"The tragedy of 20th Century styled modern war were analysed from military, technology, and human perspectives by academically well informed guide. VERY impressive place to visit to learn about the World War II. HIGHLY recommended for both young and elder."
,,Awesome experience for my teenage son !!!,5.0,,"The Battle Box is the popular name of the Fort Canning bunker which was earlier known as Headquarters Malaya Command Operations bunker. It is constructed under the Fort Canning Hill as an emergency, bomb-proof command centre during the battle of Singapore. The Battle Box is currently a museum and tourist attraction. Battlebox tour was one of the best highlights of our Singapore tour. It was very informative and my teenager son actually learnt a lot about the history of this part of the world in the 1 hour 15 minutes of guided tour. The guide was superb and well spoken. Tickets are worth the experience it offers. They have wax figures which look very real and are well detailed. The place shows details of how the British surrendered Singapore to the Japanese during the World War 2. Overall very nice experience. The place around the Battlebox of Fort Canning is lovely and peaceful for relaxing a while. It is advisable to book the guided tour in advance so that you dont waste time after reaching here. Must visit !!!"
,,Fabulous! Do not leave Singapore without doing this tour!,5.0,,"We stumbled across this tour on a day where we had planned to just stroll around the city and what a delight we did.

My 17 year old daughter and I were completely engrossed in every word our super knowledgeable tour guide spoke, as well as the clips dating back to WW2 shown throughout the tour.

I cannot rate this tour highly enough."
,,Big surprise,5.0,,My boyfriend is a huge WW2 history buff so I knew he would enjoy. I was very impressed with our guide's knowledge and with the overall presentation. Thoroughly enjoyed the tour and highly recommend it. Our 11am tour was sold out so book ahead
,,A very interesting attraction,4.0,,"A very interesting insight into the history of Fort Canning and in particular the days leading up to the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese.. Tour guide was very knowledgeable and delivered this information very well.. At SIN$20 for 75 minutes, I felt it it represented very good value for money..
It is worthwhile exploring the whole Fort Canning Park after the tour as it offers some lovely views of Singapore from pleasant leafy surroundings.."
,,Battle Box ROCKS!,5.0,,"MOST EXCELLENT HOST! Brilliantly well-spoken host takes the guest on a journey through time and 3-D space. Fun, informative and entertaining. Fantastic history lesson(s). WWII on display. The facility has been modernized nicely since my original visit in the earlyi 1990's."
,,Great historic inject from v informative guide,5.0,,Visiting here is a must if you have an interest in history. Very engaging and highly informative the tour covered the bunker’s history and a well presented tactical account of the fall of Singapore in WWII. 80 minutes well spent.
,,Great tour,5.0,,"I am retired military with a strong military history background, but still, I learned a lot. Well done tour and visuals. A cool break from the heat. Good for older youngsters if they can grasp the history and displays. I would suggest visitors who think they will come here, to do a little internet search and read up on the fall of Singapore. Then the visit will definitely be 'more better'. Warning...get there early for tickets. Tour group size is limited and if it is a busy period then expect to wait an hour. Early morning is best... first tour."
,,WW11 command centre tour,4.0,,"Battlebox can only be seen by a guided tour. The command centre comprises of 29 rooms built into a hillside. The tour guide provides a history of Singapore’s war with Japan and there subsequent surrender.

The leaflet states the tour lasts 1 hr 15 mins ours was a rushed 50 mins. I found the male tour guide was robotic and at time hard to follow.

I would recommend the tour, hopefully with a better guide.

The tour costs $20 each. There were 4 on our tour. No photos are allowed"
,,Interesting World War 2 museum,4.0,,Lots of information on the fall of Singapore during World War 2. Very interesting. Tour guide very knowledgeable.
,,Superb,5.0,,"This is the bunkers where the doomed British forces (British, Aussie, and Indian) used for their command and communications facing the invading Japanese in 1942.

This was “discovered” 20 odd years after WWII and mostly restored. A very informative and interesting tour with an excellent guide. Informative without being overly detailed for those just waiting not too great a level of depth. I had the chance for several interesting chats with the guide."
,,Fascinating and interesting,5.0,,"Our guide, Wanjun, was so knowledgeable. She brought to life the history and explained it all from a very human perspective. It makes an interesting break from all the fun type things that Singapore is famous for. We enjoyed our tour enormously and would highly recommend it.

Fort Canning Park is also a pretty place with lots of shade. Well worth exploring."
,,History abounds,5.0,,"If you are even vaguely interested in WWII as it affected the Singapore/ Malay Peninsula then this is so worth visiting. Hints & tips, the website doesn’t appear to comment on booking, but dropping an email the day before ensures you’ll be on a tour, there’s no visiting without a guide (guides are excellent but fast paced during tour). If you just turn up, places would go to those who reserved. It’s a steep 20 minute path/step climb up Fort Canning Hill whichever direction you come from, so take a taxi if you have walking difficulties. No photography during tours. Toilets are in a different building near by."
,,Incredible Story Somehow Still Under the Radar,5.0,,"I happened to discover Battlebox while perusing TripAdvisor during my last day of a five day visit to Singapore. I'd done everything else I'd aimed to do and figured I'd seen enough of the inside of shopping malls. Battlebox seemed like a worthwhile way to spend some time -- and it turned out to be one of the highlights of my Singapore visit! The incredible story of this lost relic and its surprise re-discovery makes it interesting by itself, but the way the facility has been restored as an experiential history museum to tell the story of a significant part of history is even more impressive. Add to that the fantastic and knowledgeable guide, and it's a can't miss attraction that somehow has yet to attract the crowds it should."
,,Fascinating tour,5.0,,"We really loved our tour of the Battlebox. Our guide was fantastic, very knowledgeable and took us through the underground rooms at a good pace.

I’m glad I had been to the National Museum beforehand as I felt I knew more about this part of Singapore’s history before visiting, and the tour brought it more to life (though that’s just me).

I would certainly recommend this tour! It’s popular so reserve a spot in advance by giving them a call."
,,"Sobering, yet fascinating",5.0,,"The guided tour was very good, interspersed with cine-reel footage of events from the time. The Battle Box brings to life the disaster that was the Fall of Singapore - the worst surrender in British military history.

I would definitely recommend going for the guided tour, as touring the various rooms on your own would otherwise be a little dull."
,,Battlebox,5.0,,"Very well presented and thought out tour. Guide was friendly and knowledgeable. A combination of audio visual, talk, and exhibits made it an excellent tour."
,,Super Interesting,5.0,,My husband visits this time and time again and just loves it. Very interesting for everyone but especially the history buffs. Set in a lovely park as well which is really nice to walk around!
,,Day visit,5.0,,Need to be booked before you go if on a limited time frame. The web site doesn’t make it clear how to do this . Apparently you need to ring to book
,,Very educational,5.0,,A very educational history about World War ll and Singapore. My kids ages 10 and 11 found the tour interesting and it keep their attention.
,,Informative history lesson,5.0,,"Great insight into the defence and surrender of Singapore including the people who had to make the decision, the guide was informative and had a friendly approach."
,,Beat the Heat and Fun History,5.0,,"We stumbled upon Battlebox while we were walking through the park, and the tour was just starting. It was a great history lesson and it took us out of the heat which was an extra bonus. Easy and interesting walking tour."
,,Very informative,5.0,,First thing is make sure you book ahead at least a day as day we booked there were not many places on tour left and people who just arrived for the tour without booking were turned away.Note there are only so many tours per day.Tour we did lasted approx 1 hour 15 min and was well worth the S$25 charge.We took a taxi from Singapore CBD cost approx $7.
,,Insight into WWII history,4.0,,"We walked from the Clarke Quay area to the battlebox and it is an uphill route via steps and paths. There are signs, but unfortunately construction work blocked the short route and we had to divert onto a longer path. Why there was no signage to indicate this is annoying and we had to guess where we were going. The Park needs to get its act together to encourage visitors. Signage seems to be an issue in this country.

The tour starts at the visitors centre and our very knowledgable guide Matt gave a very polished commentary as we toured the various rooms in the bunker and told the story of the final days before the surrender, showing videos and describing the tableaux.

Worth a visit and prebooking is probably best for this 1.25 hour tour which takes places several times each day. Make sure you leave enough time to walk there or get a taxi to the top"
,,Really interesting and informative. A must see!,5.0,,"My husband and I enjoyed our 1hr 15 minute tour at Battlebox underground bunker. It was fascinating to learn about the buildup to the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese back in 1942 and being in the actual room where this decision was made. Our guide was very knowledgeable and presented the tour in an interesting, engaging manner, answering any questions the group posed to him with clarity and great knowledge."
,,An interesting insight into the fall of Singapore,5.0,,"This was one of the highlights of my visit to Singapore. I wasn't sure what to expect, but found the visit to be very informative and well presented. The use of video & recreated sets within the Battlebox conveyed a atmosphere of the tense last days of British Rule in Singapore. The length of the tour was about right although a bit more time to read some of the displays might have been useful. A must for history buffs."
,,Well organised,4.0,,This place has a lot of history; through the tunnels. Also there are systematic trips organised here which are pretty detailed.
,,An interesting exhibition,4.0,,Group sizes are limited that helps everyone to see and hear the commentary from the knowledgeable guide. Well worth a visit.
,,Excellent Historical Site,5.0,,"Battlebox is a network of underground bunkers that the British used as a command and control center for operations during WWII. The tour lasts approximately one hour and fifteen minutes and includes a guide from start to finish. Our guide was excellent in providing a comprehensive understanding of the situation during the Japanese invasion which ultimately led to the British surrender of Singapore. This is an excellent tour for people or families interested in WWII history and the history of Singapore. Oddly, the museum is not mentioned on several of the tourist maps I was given. This is a strange oversight as the museum is well worth a visit and is worth the admission price to enter."
,,Battlebox 1hr Tour,5.0,,"Great value for money, fantastic tour guide, he gave enough information without going over the top very interesting would recommend to anybody visiting Singapore."
,,Battle Box exploration,5.0,,I really enjoyed going thought the various rooms of the bunker. The tour guide was quite knowledgeable.
,,Interesting tour into little-known history,4.0,,"An interesting insight into the events of WWII in Asia. The host was friendly and knowledgeable. The tour was well organised with a nice mix of media including displays, artefacts, videos and guide talks. We would have liked more time to read the text alongside the displays. Currently, guided tours are the only way to view The Battlebox and we felt a little rushed although the small group size we’ll suited to the venue. The guide was very accommodating as we were travelling with a 4 month old and a stroller."
,,History Comes to Life,5.0,,We really enjoyed our tour of the Battle Box. It was very informative and interesting. The site is located in a beautiful park that is adjacent to the Singapore National Museum. We enjoyed a few hours immersing ourselves in the history of the island.
,,Battlebox,5.0,,Very interesting. Learn the history of the Japanese invasion of Singapore and how the the British military were forced to surrender
,,A historical story - must see!,5.0,,"What a terrific 75 minutes, spent learning Singapore's difficult years during the 2nd world war. Brought to life in the very location, with audio/visuals, displays, staged figurines and a very knowledgeable guide. Great for kids as well. Be sure to fit it in!"
,,Very interesting and educational,5.0,,"We hadn’t pre booked and would advise to book in advance, we were lucky that there was availability when we turned up roughly 2 hours before the tour but quite a few people who came after us had to pre book a later tour. The tour was well organised, a mix of information from our enthusiastic guide, videos and displays. A very interesting insight into the surrender of Singapore by the British to the Japanese. Well worth a visit."
,,Informative and fascinating,5.0,,"An excellent historical museum, fully guided by an excellent guide, Esher. Access is by guided tour only, at set times. Our tour sold out shortly after we arrived so I would suggest we were lucky, book in advance to make sure you get a place.
Access is easy by many MRT, Dhoby Ghaut and Bras Brahah. Its just behind the Singapore Museum. The tour lasts just over one hour. It focused on the the invasion of Malay and the surrender of Singapore in great detail. A very important piece of history is is well preserved and the story well told. Highly recommended."
,,Best museum in Singapore,5.0,,"Tour guide has excellent knowledge of not only the Battlebox bunker but of the history of Singapore. Interesting, informative and concise. Worth an hour or 2 when in Singapore."
,,Mr,5.0,,Great tour. Very informative. Good value. Only downside is construction in park can make climb difficult if come from Fort Canning MRT. Best to come from the side close to Bencoolen MRT
,,Evocative and brilliantly presented,5.0,,The explanation from our guide and the walk through of the history of one of the most significant events in British History was excellent Not only was my father captured at the fall of Singapore but the Grandfather of one of our neighbours is one of the figures at the capitulation meeting. A must for anyone wishing to better understand this segment of history.
,,"Great in-depth re-creation of history, if only...",4.0,,"As a local and once history student, I greatly appreciated that they made the battle box come alive and conducted the tour focused specifically around the story of British's Surrender of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. The maps, historical artifacts, wax statues of the important figures to this story, the interesting story angles coupled with the great story-telling skill of the guide helped guests in immersing in the experience. I'm sure they've selected trained their guides well --- we've especially enjoyed Joanna's tour and her thorough and lively explanations of events.

Our main gripes were that this tour is conducted entirely in English. Our guest who was a true blue war veteran but non-English speaker, still enjoyed the tour, but we had to literally memorize everything on the spot and translate for him only after each section ended. Their older knees couldn't quite take the hour-long standing too. Wonder if it's possible for any improvements?"
,,Interesting tour to understand WW2 and fall of Singapore,5.0,,"Really interesting tour of command centre, film footage from the time, context of the surrender well explained and aftermath. Fort Canning park is pleasant to stroll around afterwards."
,,Great place,5.0,,"It's been a couple of years since I visited Battlebox on the recommendation of a British Airways pilot but as I was so close staying in Clarke Quay and overlooking Fort Canning Park had to visit again. There is refurbishment and works going on in the vicinity and it really isn't easy to get up here. Some of the walkways are closed. If you have any mobility issues at all please get a taxi as the steps to get up here are an absolute nightmare. The tour itself is fantastic and the guides amazing. The tour takes one and a half hours and there are three opportunities to sit down and watch a video, Very welcome if your legs are somewhat tired after the very arduous climb up here! Very worthwhile. But do visit if you can Fort Siloso on Sentosa and the former Ford Factory on Upper Bukit Timah Road for a complete picture of the WW2 story."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"This is worth a visit, good value for money. Tour guide very experienced and interesting to listen to. I liked the tour of the underground rooms, with the old video/newsreel, explaining the history. Recommend."
,,Incredibly interesting,5.0,,"Great way to spend a couple of hrs. English speaking guided tour was really interesting and presented very enthusiastically.great insight into the fall of Singapore from a perspective i had not heard . Great value .interesting for kids too .
Great place to beat the heat for a couple of hrs as the tour is all underground in the bunker and lovely and cool"
,,Great historic location to visit,5.0,,"WE had been wanting to visit here for years but each time we came it was closed or under renovation

Definitely worth visiting for an hour or more, take a tour too which brings it too life. Tour guide was interesting & knowledgeable.

Really improved my understanding of the Fall of Singapore and the aftermath Singaporean’s went through under difficult times. Air conditioning was a nice respite from the heat of Singapore too! Pleasant little shop for gifts and books."
,,History Galore but well done,5.0,,We went here on a rainy day. It is in the middle of Fort Canning park and the park itself is lovely to walk around. A lot of history was given out and I now have a very good understanding of the takeover of Singapore by Japan. Thoroughly enjoyed the time hre and very good value for money
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"Definitely worth visiting, the staff member who took the tour was interesting & knowledgeable & made the whole experience fantastic. Really get a good insight into what the Singaporean’s went through under difficult times. Also a nice break from the heat going into the underground area’s constant temperature thanks to modern air conditioning."
,,Guided tour is really the only option.,5.0,,"They presently only conduct guided tours but honestly, without the knowledge of Matt, our guide, it would have been less of a good experience. He obviously knows his subject matter and delivered it with aplomb and a little bit of humour thrown in. I have always had an interest in WWII and particularly the Pacific Theatre. I also had some preconceived notions of how Singapore was surrendered and the causes. This tour shattered some of the myths and helped my to understand the systemic failures that really left the defenders of Singapore, and in particular Lt Gen Percival, without any other option. Well worth the money and certainly a must do at least once."
,,History Lessons,4.0,,The experience would have been better if they had indicated that taxis can take you right to the event and walking up an endless hill is a problem for an old man. Good narration and factual. Very eye opening as to what happened there.
,,great tour,5.0,,"Went to this venue having read reviews on Trip Advisor and the reviewers were right. It was an excellent tour, a superb hardworking guide who managed his rabble extremely well. It was clean and without a guide bringing it to life it would have been very dull. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Fantastic insight into momentous WWII events,5.0,,The tour was delivered with rich detail. Our guide Matt was highly professional in his knowledge and delivery of a compelling journey through the Battle Box. We couldn’t recommend the tour enough!
,,My favorite tour in Singapore,5.0,,"If you have any interest in WW II and even if you don't, your going to enjoy this tour. The tour guides are very good but its the story of the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese that makes it all so interesting. The location is a bit remote from public transportation so I took a taxi, cost me $7 from the financial district. To get a taxi back to your hotel you will need to walk down the hill to the National Museum."
,,Only One Issue for Tourists...,4.0,,"You've read all about the Battlebox.. here are some pragmatic suggestions:
1) You may, as we did, go there by taxi, as the ticket office and the facility itself is high up on Fort Canning Hill and Park. The best way to get there is by taxi. But one problem. Getting a taxi to return is very very difficult. The Battlebox office team called repeatedly for a taxi for us and none arrived. So we decided to brave it and walk down lengthy steep public stairs down the hill and then find our way to the nearest bus stop. At least we were going down, not up.
2) Absolutely mandatory: if you are interested in seeing where the British high command actually surrendered Singapore to the Japanese, you must visit the Former Ford Factory (that's what it is called) on Bukit Timah Road. There the Singapore authorities have created an extensive exhibit detailing the horror of the surrender and the Japanese occupation --with film, interactive displays, and a reconstituted boardroom where the surrender documents were signed. This visit is an absolute must
So, again, you ought to combine a Battlebox visit with one to the Former Ford Factory to understand the full impact of the British collapse."
,,an interesting piece of WWII history,5.0,,Matthew brought to life a piece of WWII history that many not be aware. The Battlebox has similarities to the Churchill War rooms in London however the stories are a bit different. Matthew shared the historical signifance of each room while several short movie snippets from WW II enhanced the historical events.
,,Recommended visit from UK,5.0,,"This is a very well run museum which treats a difficult subject very well. The shop has some novel gifts and a useful range of books relating to the subject. The guided tour was excellent, and a 'must do' for anyone interested in WW2 history and/or technology and battle strategies. The material and items on display are obviously original and well worth perusal."
,,Battle of Singapore,5.0,,Good tour with guides that share different insights into why the British lost while outnumbering the Japanese invaders. Interesting walking through the bunker . Easy to get there using the metro system
,,Excellent historical tours,5.0,,"The guide took us on an informative, interesting tour behind the scenes uncovering the historical events and consequences associated with the Battlebox. We went because my partner is interetsed in military history but I enjoyed it immensely as well despite no special interest in WWII. A hidden gem and a good option for a warm day!"
,,True History,5.0,,"I love the Battlebox and bring my visitors there frequently. I am British so I vey much feel that this is true history. As you go down into the Bunker its almost like going into a time warp and you can imagine that you are there back in 1942 making the desperate decision to surrender not knowing what will happen but feeling that there is no other option.The story is brought alive in a variety of ways; old footage of real events, wax figures, and genuine sights and even musty smells from the past. Its a sad story of mistakes and very human personality clashes that perhaps altered the true picture. But wouldn't those commanders be proud of what Singapore has become today? Incidentally down in the bunker you will also meet the famous Gordon Bennett who has become so well known that many of us will recall hearing people say ""Oh Gordon Bennett!"" as an exclamation of incredulous surprise!"
,,History at its best,5.0,,"Good lot of useful information and displays. History was relevant to the display. A little more time to read and take in the information. Also a map of the structure (rooms) would be useful either on the ticket or leaflet, just to comprehend the structure of the place."
,,An excellent attraction not to be missed!,5.0,,This is a gem attraction to visit. The tour was very informatiive and provides a glimpse into the days before the surrender of Singapore during WW2.
,,Battle Box Museum,5.0,,"Amazing to learn facts about WW 2 by touring the Battle Box. We didn't see it advertised in the tours at the place we stayed and it took me a little researching to actually find a pamphlet about the site.
The tour was great , excellent guide to listen to and it was very informative to see what happened in the bunker where the decision to surrender Singapore was made. We think all Australian's should put this tour up the top of their list when visiting Singapore."
,,A MUST see in Singapore!,5.0,,"If you're interested in history, then this is an excellent tour!

Joanna was our guide and she obviously has a passion for what she does! She was very knowledgeable and explained everything in great detail. The bunker is original, but the rooms were recreated with equipment and manikins to try to give you a sense of what it was like during the war.

Once again, great tour, great guide, and a really interesting part of Singaporean history!

A MUST see in Singapore!"
,,Brilliant guided tour,5.0,,"This was a wonderfully atmospheric and inspiring tour, conducted by sn excellent guide who knows her subject and describes everything with clarity, and the appropriate mix of seriousness and humour."
,,Battlebox visit Singapore,5.0,,Very interesting insight into the situation which forced the British to surrender to the Japanese in WW2. The guide was very knowledgeable. Recommend this visit to those that that like their History.
,,Battlebox Tour Feb2019,5.0,,"Great tour and very knowledgeable guide who was very succinct in describing tactics, operations, and strategy."
,,Hidden Gem,5.0,,Battle box is a hidden gem in Singapore. The tour of the underground bunker is done with a guide who thoroughly explains what happened during the last days in the bunker before the British surrendered to the Japanese in WWII.
,,Battlebox visitors from the UK,5.0,,"One of our party who had previous links to a Fort Canning history seminar talked us into visiting the site during our short stay in Singapore, it was well worth the visit.
Very well presented and informative escorted tour which left you wanting more. Well worth a visit."
,,Informative and interesting,4.0,,"The tour guide was very knowledgeable and there was a good mixture of information formats: guide talks, videos, reading material and models & artefacts.
An interesting insight alongside the Changi museum and the Old Ford Factory.
The only issue we had was that the ticket counter didn't seem to want to give change, so make sure you you have the right cash!"
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,Really interesting to learn about the invasion of Singapore during WW2. 2 teenage children found it interesting as well. Really good guide.
,,Must See Attraction,5.0,,"A visit ot the Battlebox gives a fascinating insight not only into the fall of Singapore but the history of the events that led up to it, with an informative guide to take you through the various rooms in the bunker and films to bring it all to life, this is a history lesson well worth taking."
,,Unmissable,5.0,,"I was aware of the fall of Singapore in the Second World War but only had an outline knowledge. The visit to the Battlebox gave a much deeper understanding of the facts. Our guide was excellent throughout the hour and a half tour.
If you are in Singapore for a short or long time you must do this tour."
,,Extremely well done,5.0,,"The guided tour of the bunker was a fascinating insight into Singapore during WW2. Our guide, Chin Than, was excellent and brought the museum to life. Some good quality merchandise in the reception too. A 'must' do in Singapore."
,,Travelling in a time capsule,4.0,,"Our trip to Battlebox, a military museum in Singapore was enriching and unforgettable. Unlike other museums, Battlebox is an authentic WWII underground command centre in Singapore. It showcased a variety of exhibits in bunkers and relevant old videos were shared of what happened to Singapore under British ruling then. We learnt about the strategies used by the British commanders before Singapore was surrendered to the Japanese.

Our tour guide, Esther was knowledgeable and we had a better understanding of what had happened to Singapore during WWII after the tour. However, it would be better if we could be given more time to look at the exhibits especially the prints on the photos displayed on the walls.

The tour is only an hour and fifteen minutes which is definitely insufficient for one to explore further and take a closer look at the artefacts and displays in order to have a deeper understanding of the happenings.

Moving forward, the management could consider allowing visitors and tourists to take pics at selected sections in the bunkers as they could be kept as fond memories."
,,Awesome tour!,5.0,,"Can highly recommend taking the Battle Box tour - very interesting historical facts about Singapore during WW2 and the events leading up to its surrender. Matt, who was our tour leader, talked with such an enthusiasm, making it a very pleasant visit."
,,Battlebox,5.0,,Well this is fantastic! One of the best audio tours I've done Superb and we'll worth combining with wandering around fort canning
,,Incredible experience,5.0,,"We were really impressed by this wonderful experience. The tour guide was great, knowledgable and friendly. Would definitely recommend this."
,,Good historical museum,4.0,,"The Battlebox provides a first hand glimpse of an important point in Singapore’s history, during WWII. Definitely worth a visit, for anyone interested in that period."
,,Hidden gem!,5.0,,"We found this place quite by accident as we were staying across the road from Fort Canning Park. Googling the park to see how to walk round it, we found the Battlebox so decided to go and have a look. It's $20 per adult and the tour is 1 1/4 hours long. Our guide Joanne was very knowledgeable and informative. What a great place to visit, without giving too much away, it's a large underground bunker that was very integral to Singapore's history during World War ll. There are a few set tours per day, so you do need to plan ahead! Once the tour is completed, have a walk round the park as well, there are some great views of the city . All in all, we spent a good few hours here away from the hustle and bustle of the city"
,,Perfect introduction to Singapore's WW2 history,5.0,,"One of the most historic sites in Singapore, this fascinating underground complex gives a marvellous introduction and summary of Singapore's WW2 story. Well worth a visit. Our guide Irdianty was very informative and friendly on the 1:30 tour of 6th February. It's a labour of love well worth supporting."
,,So interesting!,5.0,,We hadn't planned on going here but we stayed very close by and am so glad we spent the time finding out about the WW2 history of Singapore. Very well done tor - small groups and not claustrophobic at all!
,,"Literally, a Hidden Gem!",5.0,,"We’ve been coming to Singapore to visit family for six years and until recently had never heard of this Battle Box Tour of the underground bunkers where so much happened to affect the city and its future seventy years ago. I’m ashamed now to realise how little I knew about what happened in WWII in this part of the world. The tour was an eye-opener - informative, most interesting, and also very moving. I just wish it was better and more widely promoted for more people to know about it and visit.

I’d read on T.A. that you couldn’t pre-book, but phoned the visitors’ centre in the morning and they reserved places for us on the 1.30pm tour; we paid when we got there. Glad we did, as the tour, which can only be about 20 people (as rooms in the bunkers are small), was fully booked.

Our guide (or docent), Matt, led us through the rooms, set up as they would have been during the war. He explained how the war strategy and tactics were developed, how information was received and analysed, how communications worked (or didn’t), and what everyday life was like down in the bunker. We learnt the tragic events that unfolded, and watched short films, with footage I had certainly never seen before - final shots of the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese and gathering up of prisoners were very moving. Matt was a great guide, very knowledgeable, and answered all sorts of questions from us. We thought this 90 minute tour was very well organised, interestingly presented and fascinating. It really brought events to life.

Practical tips
We arrived quite early, thinking we would grab a cold drink and sandwich at one of the two places on the Fort Canning Park map we took to be cafes. Unfortunately these turned out to be the Fort Canning Hotel and the Lewin Terrace (both very plush upmarket restaurants! ). So, if you need to, grab lunch at a cafe outside the park. The visitors’ centre sells a few cold drinks and crisps. Nearest loos are in the Fort Canning Exchange House, about five minutes from the visitors’ centre.

We also had a very pleasant walk afterwards round Fort Canning Park...really lovely place with loads of shade from all the trees and some good views down over modern Singapore. We ended up walking through the park to Clarke Quay (about ten minutes ) and catching a boat trip on the river to Marina Bay, and then having food at Lau Pa Sat hawker court, which all together made a great day trip out in Singapore.....reliving the past and looking at the future of this great city we love coming to!

If you are visiting Singapore don’t miss this Battle Box tour. Highly recommended!"
,,Guide Tour of the Battlebox,5.0,,"This was an awesome tour, excellent guide & great learnings about the History of Strategy & Surrender of Singapore"
,,Fort Canning Hill,5.0,,"This park is full of wonderful things to see, including a spice garden and Battlebox; Don't miss the cannons which were used to defend the hill. This is where the decision was made for the surrender of Singapore; it's not a crowded park so take your time and enjoy."
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,"We were lucky to sneak into a tour. This highlights the war experiences in Singapore. The Battlebox was the site of the British army before the surrender. Tours are guided and our guide had an extensive knowledge of the history and a great rapport with the visitors, including children in the group. My one criticism is taht the very first room contains a walls of written material which we had scant time to read let alone absorb. Some of what was there was given in the commentary but not all and I would like to have read especially the early history of the area. I believe there are plans to upgrade the museum so visitors can self-guide and that would overcome my problem."
,,Best tour in Singapore,5.0,,"You don't need to be a history buff or war expert to enjoy this tour. Great informative, engaging and fascinating tour with a brilliant overview of the fall of Singapore to the Japanese. Something for all ages."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"Came here on our last day in Singapore and it was fantastic! Our tour guide Dina (think that was her name) was an amazing guide and was super informative and friendly throughout. Such an amazing tour for such a small museum, would highly recommend when visiting Singapore! You can even go for a walk round Fort Canning Park before/after your tour."
,,"Excellent tour and so historic, a must see",5.0,,"Visited here as was not aware of the historic significance of this place and events in WWII. Guide was excellent and tour groups are small. Bunker has 27 rooms and is very well kept and so clean. I have to recommend this place, and particular thanks to this who keep the place spotless, particularly Paul, whom I got talking to after the tour and was so polite and friendly and takes his job very seriously. Thanks guys."
,,Easy to miss,5.0,,"The thing with the Battlebox is that unless you already knew about it, you can easily miss it and that would be a huge loss because it is so informative. You will be surprised by how much the kids will take in from this really informative tour"
,,A hidden gem,5.0,,Unless you aware of this venue in Singapore you will miss it. The guide was well knowledgeable and easy on the ear. It’s a must to visit and learn all about the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese in World War 2. We’ll worth a visit
,,Walk with History,5.0,,Singapore is not just about shopping and eating It is also about betrayal and surrender in the WW2 Fall of Singapore Relive the events with an excellent guide in the place it actually happened The Battle Box deserves to be top of any visitor's list
,,A must see for Military Enthusiasts,5.0,,"Arrive early if you can, this experience is quite busy. There is lots to see in the Fort Canning Park if you arrive before opening time. The tour of the facility is outstanding with lots of information and amazing displays with authentic looking models depicted what it would have been like in 1942 when the surrender to Japan occurred. You are not allowed to take photos within the bunker which was disappointing but it gave me more time to truly take in the experience."
,,Surprisingly good,5.0,,"This was my husband's choice of activity but surprisingly the whole family enjoyed it. It was a great opportunity for the kids to learn a bit of history about the war in the Pacific. The docent (Joanne) was excellent - very knowledgeable and had a very good manner. My only criticism is that I would have liked a bit more time to really read through all of the displays. Overall an excellent way to spend an hour and a half. Be sure to book though as the tour size is small and it books up quickly. You cant enter the Battlebox unless you are on a tour, but prices are very reasonable."
,,Battlebox Tour Singapore,5.0,,A really well planned tour! Informative and enjoyable. Well worth the visit but be sure to book it ahead as it sells out quickly.
,,Excellent attraction,5.0,,Very informative & entertaining guide. Lifelike people & situations which gave you an interesting insight to how life was in those days leading up to the downfall of Singapore.
,,Best thing to do in Singapore!,5.0,,"Extremely well run and organised tour through the actual bunkers with wax figures, video documentary clips and a historian to walk you through the final weeks before the fall of Singapore and the end of the British empire. Great for history buffs and people who want to understand what Singapore and the allied forces went through on the Pacific side of the war. I’ve done this tour at least 3 or 4 times and have brought many overseas friends and family to do it as it’s fabulous. They love it every single time. One comment though, children under 12 shouldn’t be allowed as they can be very distracting and disruptive. The walls of the bunkers are very echoey and any movement or noise really affects the quality of the experience. For visitors, I would advice to avoid groups with children if you have a choice as it could ruin your experience."
,,Fascinating view on part of Singapore's history,5.0,,"This visit is a must if you're interested in learning about the events leading up to the fall of Singapore in 1942. Through audio visual aids along with other artefacts coupled with a tour guide during your visit, this important part of the islands history is vividly told. The building itself is an essential part and is used very effectively during the visit. Cannot recommend it highly enough."
,,Very Interesting Tour,5.0,,This was a most interesting tour. Having a keen interest in WWII my wife and I decided to do this tour while in SIngapore. I knew very little about the history of WWII in Singapore and the battle and subsequent fall of Singapore. This was very interesting to understand what the Singapore people went through as they were conquered by the Japanese following the bombing of Pearl Harbor which opened the door for the Japanese to move on Singapore. The underground tunnel and the communication system used by the allies was toured and our guide gave a detailed account of the workings and eventually the very difficult decision to surrender. Being a British colony at the time the final decision to surrender was made by British LT General Perciful. He had to accept the terms of surrender put forth by the Japanese. At the end of the war McArthur invited Perciful aboard the USS Missouri to witness the surrender of Japan.
,,Absolutely blown away,5.0,,I have to admit I only went to this as my husband was so desperate to go. I am so glad that I did! It was really interesting and very emotional. Our guide Shah was awesome. His ability to tell the story made me feel like I was really there. Such a great guy. I would thoroughly recommend this to all.
,,Great bit of History,5.0,,"This is a great tour. We went with children 13,11,10,8 & 7. Everyone walked away learning so much from this tour. The tour guide is very knowledgeable, and was clear and concise. I would highly recommend anyone to do this tour."
,,With the visit,5.0,,"Fascinating place, learned so much from the very well informed guide. Make sure you book in advance as it’s a very popular destination."
,,Great snapshot into history,5.0,,"Very well run guided tour, video presentations and recreations of scenes using life size mannequins. Particularly enlightening to visitors from those countries involved. This is a great site to visit in a city state that has many great sites to visit. Fort Canning is also the site where Sir Stamford Raffles built his residence (now demolished) and later a military fort with remains amongst the tropical garden."
,,Unexpected Gem,5.0,,"Very interesting tour. Guide was fantastic and did not rush. She answered all questions and kept it interesting. Explains all about the fall of Singapore but starts with history of SIngapore and how the country evolved. My 11 year old son was captivated. Fascinating to see the underground rooms and feel part of the history. Nice and cool because you are underground.
Only complaint, they don't promote themselves enough."
,,Informative and educational,4.0,,This is the location of allied surrender of Singapore to the Japanese forces during WWII a must see for history buffs.The informative guided tour is part of the admission.
,,Great Educational Tour,5.0,,Well organized and facilitated. The docent was knowledgeable about the topic and was interesting to listen to. Our children learned a lot about the history of Singapore from the experience.
,,An excellent attraction,5.0,,Extremely realistic rooms set out as they were at the surrender of Singapore. Our guide was knowledgeable and informative. Well worth a visit.
,,Great tour,3.0,,"The tour was great and the guide provided a very informative experience, however I had my mobile phone pick pocketed whilst on the tour and the staff were reluctant to call the police. I had to walk to the nearby hotel to call them and report it. That aside, I would recommend going, but keep your hands on your pockets all the time!"
,,Historic Tour,5.0,,A very well run and informative tour. Not to be missed. Our escort for the tour was very knowledgeable. Well worth a visit.
,,Great!,5.0,,My second visit but much better now that I have a greater appreciation and understanding of the history. Well worth a visit
,,Worth the Entry Fee,5.0,,This was an incredible experience. Make sure you book a tour as most of them were sold out the day I visited. Allow 1 1/2 hours for the short tour. The guides are extrememly knowledgeable and you will get to experience life in the underground bunker.
,,"Very informative and interesting visit, don't miss if you like to learn about WW2",5.0,,"A part of WW2 history I knew little about before coming, this tour was really interesting. It explains the historical and strategic history of Singapore and then quickly moves to the 1930s and WW2 preparation. Fully explains the background as to why the British and Japanese were so differently prepared and how the Japanese overran Malays so quickly.

The role of the personalities is explained, including the conflicts and there is some original footage of the final days o=f the conflict including the eventual surrender

I think know know how the expression 'Gordon Bennnet' came into my life as a youngster in the 1960s!

Well worth it, make sure you get there early as the tour parties are small."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Found the Battlebox tour very interesting! Our guide took us through this site explaining the history of its use and showing us some relevant short films to supplement her talk. Nice little gift shop at the visitors’ centre. Definitely a must see, especially for those with an interest in military history. You can also explore the surrounding park which is incredible in itself. Go have a look at where Percival made his shameful decision to surrender."
,,Must see for WWII Buffs,5.0,,"I enjoyed every minute of this interesting and inspirational tour. The tour guide was professional and knowledgeable, and articulate. Well worthwhile in every respect."
,,Brought history to life,4.0,,"As this tour can't be booked we arrived early for the first tour and turned out it was a much smaller group than the 11am tour which looked huge. A very serious knowledgeable young man took the tour- he moved us through the rooms in the bunker efficiently and really knew his history. There were a couple of videos to watch, poster information and photos as well as models re-enacting important moments and people. It is air conditioned and cool but the original working conditions particularly when it was under siege must have been horrible. We didn't get enough time to read through all the information which was a little disappointing but overall a very interesting experience which brought history to life and still leaves us wondering if the decision to surrender was the right one."
,,Really worth it,5.0,,A great overview of the fall of Singapore with a wonderfully clear and organised guide Joanne. This was our fallback as Changi Museum and Chapel closed and we would certainly recommend it. The only drawback is that it can't be pre-booked and tours fill quickly so have another activity to do if you have to wait. The walks around Fort Canning Hill are interesting and the museum is close by.
,,Excellent overview,5.0,,"A very well organised tour of this command bunker that was central to the WW2 history of Singapore and Malaysia. Guided tour takes about 75mins with a good mixture of displays, video and informative description from the knowledgeable guide Check the website for tour times"
,,Very interesting. Well run tour,5.0,,I enjoyed this interesting well run tour. They take you through the bunker and explain the WWII period very well. Good for people who are interested in the history. I took my kids and it seemed to hold their attention. A good thing to do in Singapore if you don't like shopping while the rest of your party are in the shops!
,,Informative tour of one of Britain's darker days,4.0,,Tour and talk by a well informed young man.Much of the original equipment still in place and the remainder of added items authentic.Well worth the visit.
,,Lovely historical green area in Singapore,4.0,,"I enjoyed taking the kids here. It's a lovely green area with plenty of shade and ideal for a picnic. The steep hill wore the kids out :-) Unfortunately, the tunnels were not open when we visited and we didn't get time to come back."
,,Interesting way to spend 90 mins,5.0,,Booked through tripadvisor and it worked very well - very reasonable price and the tour guide was very knowledgable. The museum is excellent and gives you a good feel of the events and the military disaster. Recommended.
,,Informative and interesting,5.0,,Loved this visit. We learnt a lot and every member of the family enjoyed it. Book ahead - we didn’t realise and had to come back later. But definitely learn more about the horror of WWII in Singapore.
,,Singapore History Lesson,5.0,,"Several tours are scheduled daily, and they can be booked ahead of time. We walked in and were able to join a small group just starting a tour. Our guide knew the history and took us through the most difficult history of Singapore in World War II. Films, pictures, stories, and recreated scenes made this awful event come alive. After the tour of the underground facility, you can walk the beautiful grounds."
,,Great historical experience,5.0,,Great tour with very knowledgeable guide. Well worth doing and also walking the grounds of Fort Canning.
,,"Very good, a must visit,needs some tweaks.",4.0,,"This is the second time I have visited the Battlebox, the last time being ~15 years. This is still a great place to visit and well worth the effort.

The format is now a guided tour, it used to be self guided audio tour.

The tour is very good, the guide is excellent and knows the subject matter well.

The tour could be improved by adding sound to the rooms. Everything feels very sterile and adding some background sounds would bring the place to life."
,,Hidden Treasure,5.0,,We stumbled across this after we disembarked from the river cruise. We were just wandering around checking out the sights when we came across Fort Canning Park. We decided to go for a walk around and discovered the battlebox. We booked a tour and it was very informative. The tour guide knew exactly what she was talking about and the 1.5hrs went very quickly. Well worth the time
,,Must do in Singapore,5.0,,"Visited today with my 12 year old son. Battlebox was very easy to get to via MRT and then following their online instructions. Get here 30mins before the time slot you want to to ensure you get tickets. $20 per adult, $10 per child. It is air conditioned so that is a bonus in Singapore’s humidity. Joanne did our tour today. She spoke clearly with good English and was very friendly and good with the kids. This tour gives a good insight into the taking of Singapore by the Japanese in WWll. The worst defeat for the British in WWll. Now why is clear. The bunker is interesting to see through as it was the central command post for Singapore during WWll. Good for all visitors to understand part of Singapore’s history. Shame Changi Museum is closed. Next visit!!"
,,A Must Do Experience,5.0,,"We visited the Battlebox at Fort Canning with a group of 4 of us.
First things first, book the tour early as you can, as only about 15 or so people can be on the tour at one time.
What an experience !
We learnt so much down in the underground rooms of the battlebox.
With our tour guide telling us the story of the area and history of the surrounds.
There are short videos played in some of the rooms of the fall of Singapore to the Japanese army in WW2.
This underground bunker with about 27 rooms was facinating and beyond believe 300 plus men living down there with the attacking Japanese army on the door step.
The building presentation and tour guide was excellent.
The underground bunker is air conditioned which makes the 1hour 15 mins tour very enjoyable even on a hot day.
Two words for this tour - Totally Amazing."
,,Well worth visit,5.0,,"Visited on 3rd Jan our guide was Mathew on the 11am tour. He was very knowledgeable incredible amount of information given. Well worth visit. Must get here early to secure tickets otherwise you miss out. We were just lucky and managed to secure a spot 40 mins before start. Well worth walking around site afterwards and check out the gardens.
Easy to find from MRT.
Definitely worth the visit."
,,A sobering experience,5.0,,"This was the second time I have visited the Battle Box, the first some years ago. Much has been done to improve the experience and it is now a very well constructed and informative attraction.. The lady guide was knowledgeable and presented the facts it a very clear way bringing those terrible final days to life. Not Britains finest hour but an important period in Singapores history that needs to be documented. All in all a very informative and worthwhile visit. Highly recommended."
,,Great tour!,4.0,,This was one of my favourite museums in Singapore and definitely worth a visit. The worst defeat in the long history of the British empire smoothly detailed in a 1 hour tour.
,,an informative tour,5.0,,"We were told about this facility by friends in Singapore and was well worth the visit to get an understanding of conditions during the Japanese invasion.
A short walk to Fort Canning park but I would advise people to arrive early for the tour as places are limited and they fill up quickly.
The guide was extremely informative and this is a place you should not miss"
,,Good 2 Go,4.0,,Thoroughly enjoyed the tour very infirmative and knowledgeable guide. Very interesting recount of the period of the Jaoenses invasion and ultimate surrender
,,Interesting History,5.0,,We spent a couple of hours here and our guide “Matthew” was extremely knowledgeable. Lots of interesting history of the surrender to the Japanese.
,,wonderful,5.0,,"By the time we cherished the peace-time at this moment,it recalls our dark memory those brutes does committed.Explicitly Illustrated how a Japanese general (Yamashita tomoyuki) take control of Singapore piece-by-piece:Military contrast,the marching route(defeat UK&Australians navy and air-forces just within a short period)and use the psywar to defeat Singapore`s land-forces ultimately.If only it could also depict the genocide(like SG Changi`s massacre ) later-on......it is a pity that we tourists does not allowed to take photos here."
,,Singapore Must Do,5.0,,The Battle Box tour at Fort Canning Park is a must do. Tour guide was excellent in WW2 Japanese Invasion history. The underground British War Facility has been well restored and maintained to be enjoyed long into the future. I always knew there had to be military facilities underground in this park. Just took me 17 years to get back to see them.
,,Educational Tour,5.0,,It was a great educational tour. It was exciting to see the actual artifacts. Very interesting history lesson given by the tour guide.
,,Underground military museum,5.0,,"Located in Fort Canning Park is a very important military headquarters from World War Two known as the Battlebox, we are both very interested in military history and what better place to escape from the heat and humidity of the midday sun in Singapore. Access to the Battlebox is by guided tour only, it is important to arrive at least fifteen minutes prior to the tour commencing to secure a place on the limited number of visitors allowed. Tickets are purchased in the small and charming visitors centre which also sells souvenirs, /military/historical books, cold drinks and a few snacks. From the visitors centre we walked a short distance to the entrance of the Battlebox with Joanne, our guide for the next 1.5 hours. Joanne was fabulous, very knowledgable and good at keeping the children in our tour group interested. During our visit we viewed several short films and had small blocks of free time to view the artefacts, newspaper clippings, photographs and displays. Please note that no photography is allowed in the bunker. To our surprise while we were underground (9 metres) a storm had passed over and cooled things down briefly."
,,"Battlebox at Fort Canning, Singapore",4.0,,"A very worthwhile visit. I got to understand the conditions General Percival, his fellow leaders and the staff were working in in the days leading up to the surrender to Japan in 1942."
,,"Battlebox, Singapore",5.0,,"Historically important, wonderfully preserved and with extremely knowledgeable guides this is a must on your ‘to do’ list."
,,Well Worth a Visit,5.0,,"My husband is interested in World War history so after finding the Battlebox on Google we decided to have a look, we were very glad we did! It was very easy to find, directions on their website were excellent. We arrived 50mins early for the tour so decided to have a coffee at the Fort Canning Hotel, which is absolutely beautiful, also worth a look! Our tour was hosted by Joanne, she was excellent, very informative, very passionate about her county’s history, made sure everyone had understood what she was telling us and answered all our groups questions. Our group was at capacity, but by no means did it feel too crowded. We would thoroughly recommend this tour and a walk through the beautiful gardens surrounding this site."
,,Informative and interesting,5.0,,Well worth a visit if you are interested in the story of WW2 in Singapore and Asia. I really enjoyed it
,,Battlebox Tour,5.0,,Was a highly informative tour of the battlebox. Joanne was an exceptional guide with great knowledge. Would recommend this if you are interested in knowing more about the invasion and surrender. Oh it is also air conditioned!
,,Immersive experience on WWII history,5.0,,Excellent view of the surrender of Singapore during WW2 by reliving the invasion by the Japanese. Spending time in the bunker is a unique experience
,,Brilliant guide and fascinating history lesson,5.0,,Really interesting tour of the Battlebox. Our guide was informative and clear and got over the history of the British surrender so well. It's well worth a visit. Was disappointed that you couldn't take photos though.
,,Sobering experience,5.0,,"The Battlebox is the underground bunker where 12 British military men met and decided that Singapore should be surrendered to the Japanese during World War 2. A fascinating facility, with entry by guided tour only, lifelike figures of the men and clips of old films help give an appreciation of why the decision was made to surrender in the teeth of Churchill's edict to fight to the end."
,,"Gripping, informative and brilliantly set out",5.0,,"We visited Battlebox as a family and there was something for everyone. Our guide was the terrific Chin Han, who was knowledgeable and spoke clearly and loud enough for all to hear. The exhibits are well signed and the models are very evocative."
,,Fascinating Piece of History,5.0,,We undertook this tour as part of the extended Original Singapore Walks tour that also included the Fort Canning area. The tour inside the Battlebox was quite moving as we learnt of the events leading up to the fall of Singapore. Well done to Wina for making this come alive for us.
,,Very Interesting Tour,5.0,,"Great tour offering good insights into Allied Forces and Singapore’s role in WW-II.

Although I had worked and lived in Singapore for a number of years I had never visited this site until yesterday when visitors asked to go. We were all very impressed with the quality of the tour and the docent’s knowledge and engagement style. Tickets are sold at the visitor center and the overall program is very well organized. We did the specific 1-1/2 hour Battlebox tour which offered a good mix of touring of the facility plus historical information delivered via short movies and lecture. This is a very good program which should be of interest to visitors of most ages. Visitors may wish to weave the Battlebox tour into a longer overall day at Fort Canning or just do a one-off visit of the site which is well worth the time."
,,Good job,5.0,,I love military history and especially British history. The guide was very knowledgable and enthusiastic about Battlebox which was good to see. Good job. Worth the money
,,Another on the list of Singapore's must sees!,5.0,,"This is an excellent place to visit and learn the history of the Allies in Singapore during WWII. Will help you understand the appalling conditions the army had to endure before surrender to the Japanese. Very enlightening. Take the walk through Fort Canning Park under the shade of trees, uphill and a number of steps."
,,Great little insight,4.0,,"Intriguing insight into Singapore and it's War time history. Yeah, Ok - I'm a war history buff but also I understand geo-politics. It's a little bit formulated, but I really enjoyed it. Go see, if you have time. Rewarding, especially if you have mind that needs to understand the war and all of it's effects...."
,,Educational and interesting,5.0,,A little out of the way compared to other attractions but only a 10-15 minute walk from the closest MRT...If its raining use a taxi to get here...worth the trip
,,Late addition but a real treat,5.0,,"We only heard about this location when we were in Cambodia on a cruise (just days before our arrival in Singapore), and it certainly was a lovely addition to understanding more about the history of the island. My husband had previously visited Singapore and never heard of the Battlebox, so we were so happy to get into a tour. Our guide was incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. I will be recommending this to friends and family going to Singapore. The entire Ft. Canning area is really spectacular."
,,"Really interesting, well worth a visit",5.0,,This tour was very well run. There has obviously been a lot of work put into restoring this complex. Our guide knew his subject matter and delivered it very well. It would be of most interest to those with an interest in WWII history and or a connection to the events of the time. It is well worth a visit.
,,An interesting visit,4.0,,This was my first visit to a WW2 eastern front site. Interesting and quite surprising in regard of how easy was for the Japan Army to conquer Singapore.
,,Brilliant Battlebox tour,5.0,,We had a small group tour of the Battlebox - the WWII British commanders' bunker at Fort Canning - in November 2018. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and brought back vividly to life the dire situation that General Percival and his senior officers faced as Japanese General Yamashita tightened his grip on Singapore and forced their unconditional surrender.
,,Battle Box tour,5.0,,This was an excellent attraction. Very interesting historical story and very well told by out tour guide.
,,A must do tour while in Singapore,5.0,,If you’re interested in history a visit to the Battlebox should be on your list. The guide was excellent sharing information on Singapore and it’s story during WW2.
,,Interesting and informative tour.,5.0,,Our guide really made the tour very interesting and we learnt a lot. The area was air conditioned so atmosphere was conducive to listening and getting involved. My daughters went with me and they also found it very good.
,,A Highlight of my visit to Singapore,5.0,,"A great way to learn more about World War II, some of the military leaders of the time, the tactics used and the living conditions of the headquarter's troops during that time. The tour guide was extremely knowledgeable. The tour was a good mix of narrative by the guide, videos, and displays. Definitely worth a visit, especially for those interested in military history."
,,A tour not to be missed!,5.0,,"This historic site is amazing. I don’t know why we haven’t heard more from travel agents about it. The staff were very knowledgeable, professional and helpful people. I will be recommending the tour to our friends and travel agent."
,,Insightful and Moving,5.0,,"Our very knowledgeable and personable guide gave a brilliant ""history Lesson"" while leading us through the underground bunker where the decision to surrender was made. Whilst being in the bunker and hearing about the events and harsh reality the allied forces faced in Singapore, with limited and poorly maintained equipment, and no possible backup arriving; you could understand why the decision was made. A very moving experience. This was definitely a high light of our visit to Singapore and I would highly recommend this guided tour."
,,Great experience,5.0,,Fantastic experience. Everyone coming to singapore should learn about its past. So glad I did this as it was super interesting. The guide was fantastic
,,Modern Singapore history,5.0,,Love ww2 history at the best of times and thoroughly enjoyed being journeyed through this notable Singaporean ww2 landmark. Well worth the time and great value for money.
,,Very informative tour.,5.0,,Interesting history of the world war 2 bunker at Fort Canning. The guide was excellent and the exhibits displayed nicely.
,,Excellent museum. Top notch docent guides.,5.0,,Cool museum. The highlight was definitely the guides. Extremely well trained and shared knowledge in a way that kept your attention the whole time. The setting in an actual war bunker and the cool unknown of (as an american) facets of world war 2 and the involvement of singapore in the pacific theater was illuminating.
,,Brings history back to life,5.0,,My wife and I had an excellent morning at the battlebox. A hidden gem in Singapore that reflects a fundamental period of their history.Esther conducted our tour at 0945 hours. She was very informative and friendly intelligently explaining to us this turbulent and sad period of history.The rooms were bought to life by the figures which accurately represented the key players of the allied command in 1942. We left there feeling much better informed and somewhat sad about this period of history .Esther conducted the small group in a very efficient and effective manner.She is a credit to the Battlebox.We would highly recommend anyone who has a sense of history to visit the Battlebox when in Singapore.
,,Fascinating Tour,5.0,,"The tour takes maybe 90 minutes but is packed with history and a not a little humour. Our guide was outstanding, usinjng gestures in addition to voice in a more effective manner than I have ever seen before, she made the story or the Battlebox come alive. Not to be missed in any Singapore visit."
,,Excellent tour,5.0,,My wife and I really appreciated this informstive and interesting tour. It really brought home the difficulties of command in wartime.
,,Linking history to present day,5.0,,We are lucky enough to know a very special person who is still with us who was an Australian POW when Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942. It was great to link his stories about the past through the Battlebox tour we did. It was a must do activity on our trip to honour our special friend who is now in his nineties and still recalls vividly his time in Singapore as an Australian 2/29th battalion soldier and teenage POW.
,,Historic museum,5.0,,"We visited this place on our school excursion.The great point of this museum is that we can join the guide tour for free. It helps learning history, and also English."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,Very interesting to tour the bunker and when combined with a thoughtful and thorough commentary it was a great way to understand the fall of Singapore in WWII
,,Great history tour,4.0,,"Having lived here for 5 years i was embarrassed that i hadn't ventured out enough to better understand the country history. stop one was Battlebox which was recommended by a friend who is passionate about the world wars.

batllebox wasn't too busy so i just turned up on a sunday morning and bought a ticket. at the allowed time the tours started and the guide did an excellent job in walking the group through the WW2 command centre for british troops.

It was fascinating to hear and see what had occurred, all explained with good level of detail but never boring.

I was there probably an hour + and thoroughly enjoyed. i recommend for all ages from teenager up (not kids though, not exciting enough)."
,,Singapore are UK's friends,5.0,,"I study the war and have a special reason to visit this site. Singapore are friends of the UK and part of the commonwealth.
My uncle was on the first British boat to enter Singapore harbour as the British pushed the Japanese back and the war ended.
Walking round the war round I was able to map out the tactics used by the forces. Even find the records of the ship my uncle came in on.
I left in tears and loving memories of all that was done and the thought of my wonderful uncle.
Good place"
,,History Lesson,5.0,,"The bunker in Singapore is where the British Army surrendered Singapore to the Japanese in WW2 (the largest ever capitulation of the British Army). You need to book onto a tour which I believe run hourly and you get guided round in a group. Extremely informative and for me I picked up plenty of new historical detail from the excellent and enthusiastic guide. Poor planning, strategy, negotiation and a lack of common sense led to the disaster for the British Army which cost thousands their lives then but also during the war in POW camps. Definitely worth visiting."
,,"Great experience, highly recommended",5.0,,Visited Battlebox with friends who were visiting Singapore. It’s an amazing site and I’m really glad we visited. The history of the campaign and the main characters is fascinating. This is a ‘must visit’ for those who want to better understand the war time history of Singapore. Highly recommended.
,,"Engaging Tour, Meaningful Experience",5.0,,"I joined the 2 1/2 hour tour (SGD32) which started with an outdoor tour of the park from 2-3pm, followed by an underground tour of The Battlebox from about 3.15pm-4.30pm. There were only 5 of us, which gives us the luxury of asking questions and taking a slower pace. Before the tour start, we were given a bottle of cold mineral water (thanks!)

Our guide, Poh was very knowledgeable and experienced. She was also attentive to all our questions and answer them patiently. I enjoyed listening to the stories she shared about challenges of the British Army when the Imperial Japanese invaded Malaya and Singapore during WWII.

This is such a meaningful tour because it gives you a comprehensive background of how Singapore became what she is today. The influence from colonisation and war is deeply engraved in the roots of this country. Looking at the current Singapore, from being such a vulnerable place, to a strong and peaceful first world country, one can only feel proud of how resilient the people here are. Personally, I feel grateful and indebted to those who sacrificed during the war. We have much to learn from these brave men and women.

Tips for your visit: Apply mosquito repellent if you’re not used to the tropics. Bring a hat, and an umbrella (for the erratic hot and rainy weather), comfortable shoes.
This 2 1/2 tour is only available on Monday and Thursday at 2pm."
,,Battlebox ~ a must visit for History buffs!,5.0,,"The Battlebox tours for the day we were there were all sold out: we booked on-line months before our trip. Anyone interested in understanding the history of Singapore should start with the National Museum of Singapore; from there explore Chinatown, the Hindu and Malay districts, the Arab quarter, and then the Anglo/European parts, including the Battlebox. Singapore is about so much more than the shopping!"
,,Great tour!,5.0,,"Came here for the 11am tour and had a great time! It was very interesting and the tour guide spoke well. Was, great to learn about the bunker and the war!"

,,Bit of Singapore history,5.0,,"Had a couple of hours to spare on business trip in Singapore. Really wanted to know more of the history and this is a good little slice (1hr 15 min). The young guide fellow was EXCELLENT!! Would recommend.
Fort canning park is nice too - get to see raffles house (small and not open) and done squirrels!
Not far from Clarke quay and old police station so easy to walk to but there is a lot of steps at park entrance on this side."
,,excellent museum,5.0,,Fantastic way to learn about the history of Singapore! Great park setting - beautiful! So close to town!
,,A wonderful and informative walk through history,5.0,,"Since every tour is docent led, you get the full story of the site and the background of what happened here. The tour is a bit over an hour long and involves a good amount of exploring the bunker complex and some multi-media to help explain the situation leading to Singapore's surrender."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,We thoroughly enjoyed the guided tour in the underground command centre of Fort Canning hill. Tour was very informative and gave us a great insight into some part of the history of Singapore and Malaysia.
,,Fascinating peek into one of the more fascinating events of WW11 in our Region,4.0,,"Enjoyed immensely the guided tour by an excellent guide, but would have liked more time to check out the displays and photos."
,,Great tour,5.0,,It’s the greatest tour I’ve ever joined. Probably because I’m interested in history espaiclly wars. I would say I could have more time staying inside to take a deeper look at the details.
,,Battlebox,5.0,,Very informative & interesting facts about the war history of Singapore. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

,,Interesting piece of history.,5.0,,I enjoyed hearing the history of the Battlebox and the events leading up the Japanese invading Singapore. The videos were especially good as a lot of the photos were from the newsreels of the time. The guide was very knowledgeable.
,,A Must For WW2 History Buffs,5.0,,"What an excellent place to visit in Singapore, History brought to life with this your. Our guide through the bunker was excellent. She was so informative and enthusiastic, but more so brought the feeling of what it must have been like to be with Percival in those days prior to the surrender of Singapore.

While only a few genuine artefacts remain, they have acquired items which bring it to life and give a real sense of feeling.

The tour lasts about 75 minutes but it flew by as every room had something new to add and kept you enthralled throughout.

Great visit, great guide(apologies for forgetting her name)........ the only downside was that I could not take photographs for my memories."
,,Underground attraction,5.0,,"Very much enjoyed this wonderful tour, great for young and old. Very informative . Had done this tour previously before the updates. The tour guides are wonderful, but hope that the younger girls haven't replaced all the older gentlemen that used to conduct these tours, as I believe they added some authenticity to this tour. Younger is not always better. Older age has a lot to offer ."
,,A very interesting place to visit,5.0,,"An interesting and informative guide takes you through the story of the surrender of Singapore, A great place to visit for all the family. The tour takes about an hour an a half but doesn’t seem that long"

,,A step back in time,5.0,,Loved this step back into Singapore's WW2 history. Well worth taking the time to do the tour. The guide was knowledgeable and gave us a real feel for life in the bunker. The tours run at set times and you should book in advance to be sure of a place. Fort Canning is nice to walk around and the Singapore Museum is nearby if you have a long wait until your tour begins.

,,A must do when in Singapore,5.0,,"An interesting, well organised, clearly delivered tour of the war bunker in Fort Canning. Chinhat was an excellent guide.
In just over an hour of talk,video and walking through the bunker rooms I gained a great deal of knowledge about the fall of Singapore in 1942. One of the best short tours I have been on. Many thanks."
,,Interesting but over-long,3.0,,Guide was good and very knowledgeable but overall we felt the tour was too long with a lot of repetition - interesting but hearing the same information repeated several times made the tour feel dragged out by the end.
,,Interesting walk thru the bunker,4.0,,"A local guide took us thru the bunker, and the history of it during the last days before surrendering to the Japanese during the second world war"
,,Very Informative,5.0,,Spending Remembrance Day at this location was very fitting. The guide was very knowledgeable and the whole experience was fascinating. A must do in Singapore whether you are a history buff or not!
,,Very informative tour,5.0,,This tour of the underground command centre was well worth the hike up Fort Canning hill in the humidity of Singapore. The history of the fall of Singapore and the surrender is given in great detail. A very worthwhile tour.
,,Remembrance day,5.0,,Being in Singapore and not at a normal parade or service this had the same make you think. The tour was excellent. Tour guide was informative and brilliant. Would thoroughly recommend this tour. Book in advance if you can we turned up and were very lucky to get on the visit we wanted.
,,Nice guided tour,5.0,,"This is a well-done tour. The narrator was excellent and, although the exhibits are a bit dusty, the Battlebox visit was quite pleasant and thoroughly educational. Too bad picture taking is not allowed. After the tour I enjoyed the walk around the Canning Hill."
,,Amazing Singaporean/SE Asia history tour,5.0,,This is a great tour about the capitulation of the British forces in SE Asia (WWII) and why this happened in Singapore. The way the guide took us through the rooms and the history timeline was perfectly aligned and interesting.
,,Battlebox tour,5.0,,"An excellent tour, with some interesting less known facts about the surrender and subsequent liberation of Singapore during WW2. My wife hates all this war stuff, but even she was intrigued!"
,,Awesome,5.0,,The Battlebox is viewed by tour guide only and this is necessary to immerse yourself in what happened with the fall of Singapore to the Japanese and how quickly this occurred.
,,Fall of Singapore,5.0,,"The guided tour of the Battlebox was an unexpected highlight of our trip to Singapore. The Battlebox is a elobrate underground command-centre bunker built in preparation for the Japanese invasion of Singapore.
We were totally absorbed.

There is an hour+ tour that focuses on the Bunker and an extended tour that provides a history of Singapore with a walk around Fort Canning.

I thoroughly recommend visiting The Battlebox."
,,History face to face,5.0,,"My wife and I did the Battle Box tour on a very hot weekday afternoon. The tour is very enlightening about what happened in Singapore in the lead up to the surrender of the British to the Japanese in WW2.
Our tour was lead by a knowledgable and witty young man who kept us informed and entertained during the tour through the tunnels under Fort Canning.
Tours fill up very quickly, so it is worthwhile getting in early to book a place.

If you are into WW2 history this is a very worthwhile tour to do,"
,,Underground history,4.0,,"Its cool underground, the tour was very insightful and sobering. Would they have been better surrendering or continuing to fight? We will never know."
,,Unheard of attraction - highly recommend,5.0,,We stumbled across this when we were given a voucher pack email following a hotel booking. This is a great tour for anyone interested in history particularly relating to the war etc. Similar to Churchill War Museum in London. Thoroughly fascinating
,,Battlebox tour,5.0,,"The staff are very friendly. Irdianty was my guide. A well spoken guide. She is friendly, engaging and full of knowledge. The tour does gives you a brief perspective of what wartime Singapore must have felt like."
,,Must do for WW2 buffs,5.0,,"Very well put together tour! Very interesting, we did the 1.15 hour tour and it flew by. The tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable and entertaining."
,,fantastic museum,5.0,,"great for the whole family , highly recommend, very informative guides . Even if you have no interest in ww2 history its still worth the effort"
,,Informative history of Singapore,5.0,,"I found this tour very interesting and informative. Having lived in Singapore for a couple of years and visiting many more times, this was my first visit to Battlebox and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I now understand more of the history. The facts and figures were made more enjoyable by our entertaining guide, Matthew."
,,Fascinating History. A must-see.,5.0,,"The Battlebox gives a fascinating glimpse into Singapore's history and an often misunderstood part of World War 2, the surrender of Singapore. The guide was friendly and knowledgeable and the small group size made it easy to see, hear and move around. A must-see for any visitor to Singapore."
,,Very OInterseting,5.0,,The guided group tour through the facility was informative and well presented. We found the untold Singapore his interesting. One of the cheaper activities in Singapore
,,"Very, very interesting, well delivered bit of important history",4.0,,"Our guide was very knowledgeable, and made this a very good activity. Fantastic history that is not really a good story for British military strategy.

The Japanese were certainly well resources and managed pity about their treatment of prisoners which was shameful.

The story of the fall of Singapore is fascinatingly told, and walking through the underground rooms where fateful decisions were made complete with lifelike wax dummies of the British officers.
It is great story worth listening to and it is told well."
,,Treasure of Battlebox,5.0,,"This is really must-do for everyone who is interested in history of WWII. Not a big museum, but it is a real deal. It is part of military fortifications, so it is can be a bit claustrophobic for some, but that is how it was for soldiers as well. Our guide was very informative and answered all our questions. Museum has a small gift shop with good selection of books on related subject. The tour lasts just over an hour, we learned a lot in that hour, there were some extra bits of info you just cannot appreciate reading books or even watching docos. If military history is your thing, you will enjoy this tour."
,,Rest & Recover,5.0,,"Fantastic couple of hours spent on the tour. Full of information, the guide was excellent, was approachable to answer a few questions that I had.Well worth the money. A must visit if interested in the history of Singapore.Totally recommend this tour."
,,"Battlebox, Fort Canning, Singapore",4.0,,I enjoyed the battlebox very much. As a student of military history the historical detail provided in the actual bunker gave a realistic edge. My wife and I both lost family members on the Death Railway as a consequence of the allied surrender at Singapore. Well worth a visit.
,,Intriguing British war-era history in display,5.0,,"I learned about Battlebox from my friend, and she recommended it because we are history lovers. And it is very interesting, if you like history, especially WW2 era history. The museum was built from wartime bunkers around 9 meters below surface in Fort Canning area. The entrance to the museum must be through a guided tour that can be bought at the Visitor Center for SGD 18. The tour itself run for around 1,5 hours, and it is very thorough and can bring your imagination back in time. The place itself is air conditioned, so it is quite comfortable, but unsuitable for disabled visitor."
,,Battle Box Tour Singapore,5.0,,"At my husband suggestion, I agreed to join the Tour not normally my thing! The Tour guide was friendly and informative. The realistic figures and exhibits coupled with the film clip of the actual surrender eveoked an emotional response to the events at that time."
,,Enthusiastic Guide made our Visit,5.0,,"So we came with some WW2 fans, whilst we were sceptical loved the experience. Well executed short introduction to the history of the region. Interactive and fun, brought to life by a great guide Nancy. Would highly recommend"
,,For history buffs,5.0,,"Fantastic sight very good guide who knew her stuff! When ther go and see the rest of the sight especially the old barracks and officers quarters, now hotel. No wonder the Brits liked going to Singapore!"
,,Fascinating place to visit,5.0,,"We enjoyed a fascinating tour of this important wartime site. Our guide was very engaging - very knowledgeable, but made it very interesting without overwhelming with facts. The rooms on show are well presented, sometimes with wax figures representing the key people involved in appropriate tableau. Sometimes there were short videos which helped to bring it all to life. Very well worth a visit."
,,Re-live wartime Singapore!,5.0,,"The Battlebox was the Malaya Command Operations HQ, built under Fort Canning Hill, Singapore. It was used as an emergency, bomb-proof command centre during the Malayan Campaign and the Battle of Singapore. The Battlebox is definitely worth visiting if you are in Singapore. Note, however, that visits are by organised tour so tickets need booking. The tour is interesting for two principal reasons: 1) Entering the Battlebox provides a unique insight into the cramped and intense conditions the army operated under during the Battle of Singapore which, in the end, was won by the Japanese; but, 2) The tour itself is very interesting. Wan Jun conducted my tour and provided a detailed history of the strategic issues faced by the British in defending Singapore while Britain was already heavily engaged on the Eastern front. I would allow 90 mins for the tour and perhaps another 30-45 mins to explore Fort Canning itself, which provides peaceful, green surroundings and some old fort ruins.

Battlebox is easy to get to and sits near several MRT stations. I travelled to Dhoby Ghaut (CC1) but Bras Basah (CC2) and Fort Canning (DT20) are also close by. In fact, it is probably walkable from City Hall too.

I would suggest visiting the WC before arriving at the Battlebox, perhaps at the nearby Singapure shopping complex if you alight at Dhoby Ghaut, as there is no toilet at the Battlebox. The nearby ex-Pinacothèque de Paris building (unsure what it is called now) provides a single WC for gents, but was queued when I tried."
,,Worth the trip!,5.0,,"The Battlebox tour was one of the highlights of my trip. Led by an extremely knowledgeable guide, we toured this well preserved site gaining a great insight to its significance in the history of Singapore."
,,Fascinating for WW2 Buffs,5.0,,"This is an excellent museum if you have an interest in World War II. This tells the story of the surrender of the Allied forces when the Japanese invaded Singapore. A tale of lack of preparedness. This is a guided tour; our guide was Aysha and she was terrific. Very knowledgeable. We later went to Bangkok and from there toured the Hellfire Pass monument (River Kwai bridge, etc) and it helped to know the background of this surrender of many troops in Singapore."
,,Fascinating. A must do,5.0,,my wife and I and 2 teenage girls found this tour to be amazingly fascinating and so worthwhile. We all enjoyed it so much and learnt a huge amount about this incredible history
,,Battlebox Tour,5.0,,This was a great little activity to do while I was in Singapore. Able to walk through Fort Canning Park taking some pictures and timed it perfectly to make it for a tour. Basic tour takes about 75 mins. Gets you out of the heat and teaches you about a slice of the Pacific War (WWII). For someone used to always hearing about the European Theatre it was refreshing to have another perspective. Subway stops are convenient on either side of the park and the National Museum is close to the Battelbox entrance if you wanted even more historical activity. Watch out for the Skylight! I took a picture beforehand not even knowing what it was and was pleasantly surprised during the tour.
,,Informative History Tour,5.0,,So glad we did this tour as it was so informative and interesting. You walk through the actual rooms with most of the original infrastructure and furniture still in place. so you could imagine what it was really like. at the time. The guide had a wealth of history knowledge. Well worth the visit
,,Very Informative.,5.0,,"My wife and I both found this attraction very informative. The guide was excellent and the Battlebox itself very interesting. We learnt a lot. My wife actually won the prize for answering the end question. My only comment would be to allow the taking of photographs (without flash). It would add to the memories, and I'm sure when those photographs were shown to friends would encourage them to visit too.NB. We also visited Fort Siloso on Sentosa - also excellent, and were allowed to take non-flash photographs there."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"Battlebox is a very interesting museum on a well preserved site. The tour gave a fresh insight into the battle, explaining well what happened and why. Highly recommended!"
,,A Battle worth the visit,4.0,,"This was my second visit to the Battlebox (the first being 2011). Still as interesting as ever, however this time lacked the animated dummies with dramatised commentary via headphones.Would still highly recommend a visit, even if you don't have a strong interest in war history (my wife came and loved it)."
,,interesting,5.0,,"Worth a visit if your in Singapore,interesting to learn the history of the battlebox and to see how difficult it would have been working in those conditions."
,,Fascinating incite into forgotten history,5.0,,First class guide for a great tour. The worst defeat in British history but essential learning for those forget our past. Very atmospheric
,,update of the Battlebox,5.0,,we had an excellent guide who took us thru the Battlebox. This was my second trip thru it and although she did an excellent job I personally would have preferred the method used 2 years ago where there was not a set script. I am concerned that the individual questions will not get answered when they go to self guided tours with headsets
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"A most informative tour of the Battlebox, delivered with great knowledge and enthusiasm of and for that period in history, by a very engaging tour guide. All guides have a history major, and competently answer all questions."
,,Battle box tour,5.0,,"This tour is well worth taking. The guide was enthusiastic, knowledgeable and easy to understand. Highly recommend"
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,Having visited Singapore every year since 2011 this was our first visit to the Battle Box. We had come across it the previous year and can say what a great insight into the Battle for Singapore it gave. We would rate it as a must see when visiting Singapore.
,,historic battlebox,5.0,,"The high light of our short trip to Singapore was a guided visit to the battle box bunker, our guide Wan Jun was very informative, and answered the many questions by the group, the display inside the bunker was top class, the mannequin soldiers inside were pretty real looking, instead of the usual shop dummies with a wig on, I would highly recommend this attraction, even if you are not interested in war history, it's worth a visit. I give it 10 out of 10"
,,Battle Box,5.0,,A very interesting tour with a female guide who spoke reasonably good English but you had to listen carefully because of her Asian accent. She was very knowledgeable with the facts of WW2 and the collapse of Singapore.I found this tour on a par with Winston Churchills underground Cabinet War rooms in London but having the model replicas of the people involved at the time was a plus. There were no models in London.I am surprised that the English garrison capitulated to the Japanese in view of the facts that they had superior manpower etc. So much information has been revealed since this event which could have made the result entirely different. General Percival's leadership and decision making was poor from the time he was promoted to the Singapore garrison. Wikipedia has the full facts which give full details why this whole tragedy could have been averted.
,,Authentic World War 2 History,5.0,,"This was an excellent tour. The bunker was the British military command centre, and the site where the decision to surrender to the Japanese was made. It is now air-conditioned, well presented, and the tour guide knowledgeable and enthusiastic. I highly recommend this tour."
,,A trip through tunnels and history,4.0,,"Very interesting tour. Must for the fans of the Sencomd World War. Really learnt a lot about the place, Singapore and Asia."
,,Bsttle box tour,5.0,,Well worth the visit and the tour would reccommend this tour to anyone interested in the history of the fall of Singapore
,,Battlebox,5.0,,"What an awesome and informative experienceOur guide was very knowledgeable and friendly, was very clear and gave us time to look and ask questions."
,,Great place to visit - a MUST see in Singapore,5.0,,"Fantastic exhibition, both from the perspective of touring the exhibition plus explaining the history of Singapore and WW2 (why Singapore fell)Firstly, the environment. To be underground and feel what it was like, as if you were in WW2 was brilliant. To understand how Singapore stood alone and the decision made to surrender was so easy to comprehend.We recommend to all visitors to visit.Surrounded by great gardens too"
,,Interesting step back in time,5.0,,I would not say that I have a particular interest in history but being in this place opened up an interest. The guide was very knowledgeable and presented the historical information really well. The story of events leading up to such a dramatic outcome opened my eyes.
,,Back to the future,5.0,,The tour guides were well equip with the knowledge and they were able to convey the history of the battlebox well to the visitors.
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,What a surprise this place is tucked away in Fort Canning. Well worth going to. A great look back at history. The tour guide was very good and told the story really well. The battlebox is well looked after and really gave you a feel for what the soldiers would have gone through.
,,Great experience,4.0,,"We did a walk organized by The Original Singapore Walks Company. Very well informed guide who made the whole experience well worth it. Since it was a rather hot afternoon, our teens were a bit restless, but that aside it was very memorable, and an unusual kind of activity for a highly commercialized Singapore!"
,,History in the Flesh,5.0,,"Learn how the British surrendered Singapore to the Japanese in the exact location where the decision was made, an underground bunker complex. A guided tour of around 1 hour explains the history and events leading to the loss of Singapore. The guide was well informed reeling off facts with absolutely no aids. The numbers on the tour are restricted so get tickets early. A shop aslo available for those gifts."
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,This was so informative and one of the best tours i have been on. My husband really enjoyed it as well
,,Excellent historical tour,5.0,,This was an excellent tour and review of events that happened before most of us were born. The bunker was airconditioned and well presented. And we were luckily in that the director himself took our tour and his knowledge and enthusiasm added to the morning: highly recommend this tour
,,An excellent guided tour,5.0,,"The Battlebox was an informative, enjoyable way to learn more about Singapore's history. The tour guide was excellent, friendly, able to captivate her audience, clearly present information about the experience, and was happy to take questions. Well worth a visit!"
,,For historian,4.0,,Fascinating and well laid out presentation of this interesting and devastating period of history. I would only go on this tour if you have a keen interest in history and WW2.
,,Great,4.0,,A bit over an hour very well spent. Lots of story telling to provide excellent context. As a bonus it is wonderfully air conditioned.
,,Well worth a visit if you like military history,5.0,,Very knowledgeable and friendly tour guide. Well worth a visit. Everything is preserved just as it was in WW2.
,,READ,3.0,,Make sure you know the hours of operation - last tour is 1 hr before closing!!! We did not make it this time. Area around is a cool park.
,,Interesting chapter in history,4.0,,This was a an interesting tour giving lots of information about a key part in Singapore’s history. The rooms in the actual bunker are a bit repetitive - unsurprising as it is a bunker! But you do get a good fell for how claustrophobic and hot it would have been in there. On our day the mid morning tour was cancelled - we didn’t know this until we arrived at Fort Canning. This was a bit of shame as the next tour was something like 3 and half hours later.
,,Battlebox - An excellent production,5.0,,We had experienced Battlebox about 20 years ago. We wanted to see it again and were not disappointed. The group was a good size and the guide was excellent. The reproductions of the events were excellent and the equipment used was typical of the time. The length of the tour was appropriate. I can also recommend a visit to Kranji War Memorial (NW Singapore) to see the war graves and the Operation Jaywick (MV Krait) memorial plaque.
,,A Surprising Hidden Gem,5.0,,"Our tour of the Battlebox was great its location within Fort Canning Park makes it easy for people to access being only a 10 minute walk from Dhoby Ghaut MRT station even closer if you are staying at the Fort Canning Hotel as we were. Our tour guide Matthew was very knowledgeable and willing to answer any of your questions. For anyone interested in WWII history I would recommend you do this tour, by its end you will have a greater understanding of the hopeless position the British and Australian troops had in trying to defend Singapore from Japanese invasion and the lack of support they received for the high command."
,,Surprising,5.0,,Easy to reach by metro with a walk up the hill for 5 minutes.Good presentation by the guide and a nice souvenirshop.Temperature inside the bunker is nice.Check times before the tour (always) by guide.
,,WWII History - Underground Command Center in Singapore,5.0,,We went with a group of fellow homeschoolers to learn a bit about Singapores WWII history. The Battle Box tour on Fort Canning hill includes visiting ~20 rooms and command rooms that were constructed 30 feet underground during WWII to serve as underground bunker / bomb shelter / military command center. Our guide was knowledgable and thorough and we all learned a lot about Singapores history. I recommend.
,,very interesting,4.0,,"Staying at hotel fort canning, I walked by the Battlebox and found it very interesting. Incredible what when throught those people."
,,Interesting - Worth doing!,4.0,,"Really good tour and certainly worth doing if you have a few hours spare whilst in Singapore, the only downside was that there was alot of ppl on the tour i attended (almost too many to fit in most of the rooms), which made it slightly uncomfortable at times.

i won the prize at the end though which made up for that."
,,Guided tour with Shar,5.0,,We have just completed this tour to be honest I did not want to go however Shar is so knowledgeable and personable I thoroughly enjoyed the tour I can highly recommend it
,,Highly recommended!,5.0,,Whatever good reviews you read on TripAdvisor about this tour is true and probably even better in real life. Highly recommended especially for young kids or teens as it is an eye opening history lesson they might not learn in school.
,,Battlebox historical site,4.0,,Very interesting overview of this important historical event which began a new era in Singapore. There were eight of us in our group (parents and adult children) who enjoy learning about history. Thank you for this educational experience.
,,Interesting -Well Worth a Visit,4.0,,"The Battlebox Museum is a great insight into the final goings on of the battle of Singapore in WW2. The bunker is still in tact and it is a great walk through of those days. The guide was knowledgable however he was a bit too clinical and quick as you were rushed to read any of the exhibits displayed. You need to book a tour as you cannot just wander through and tours are restricted to relative small groups. Call the museum and book a time to avoid ""hanging around waiting"" like I did!

The tour was made up of many nationalities and the general consensus was that it was a very good tour (approx. 1 1/2 hr)"
,,A totally different tourist attraction - don't miss it!,5.0,,"On a week's holiday in Singapore with 2 kids 8 & 10 we decided to visit BattleBox. I was unsure whether my kids would enjoy it but their grandfather was in the army and had been in Singapore so we thought we would try it. They LOVED it, as did I. A really interesting tour with a very knowledgeable and interesting tour guide. My son was hanging on her every word and managed to win the little quiz at the end, much to the surprise of all of us! It was great to hear more about the Argyll & Sutherland Highlander's involvement in this key part of history!"
,,A must for WWII buffs.,4.0,,"What a great way to learn about the impact that WWII had on Singapore and its people. The infamous attack on Pearl Harbour often overshadows the story of Singapore when telling the story of the war in the Pacific. By visiting this informative and atmospheric relic of WWII my adult son and I learnt that Japan's intentions for domination of south east Asia were deliberate and immediate with the invasion of Malaya begining the day after Pearl Harbour and ending with the surrender of Singapore and 100,000 allied soldiers two months later. This solemn representation of the decisions made by the allied commanders and the subsequent impact on Singapore's civilian population (300,000 people disappeared over the next 3 years) was an eye opener and had far reaching impacts on the war. As an Australian it is part of our history that more should be aware of and shows how woefully prepared the allies were. The only thing that would have been an improvement was if the knowledgeable presenter had allowed us to ask more questions rather than being pushed from room to room. A must see for WWII buffs and even if you are not, an eye opening way to spend a couple of hours surrounded by the pleasant Fort Canning Park."
,,Enter the bunker!,5.0,,Excellent guide who was very knowledgable. The best bit was when I won the quiz at the end! Super visit and well worth the money
,,WW2 Hidden Gem,5.0,,Absolutely thrilled with our informative tour of the WW2 Battlebox set within the beautiful Port Canning Park. We were totally surprised by the inside space as it looks quite small from the outside. Definitely a must see to gain an understand of the surrender to the Japanese.
,,Possibly the best part of my holiday to Singapore,5.0,,We had a superb tour of the Battlebox. It put the history of Singapore and the 2WW into context which helped us understand our stay much better. Can’t recommend enough!
,,Highly enlightening,4.0,,"We were not expecting too much from this tour to be honest.
So it was a great surprise that we found the experience extremely educational led by a very enthusiastic, passionate and knowlegable guide.
It was a great way to spend just over an hour and come away learning new pieces of information about the wonderful country of Singapore.
If you are not comfortable in confined spaces then you may elect to ask more about the tour from the Battlebox people.
Not being permitted to take photos is a bit annoying once you enter the Battlebox underground fortress, however it is a small price to pay.
All told, we would highly recommend the tour to anyone who is remotely interested in this country's history.
This tour is exceptional value-for-money."
,,Battlebox tour,5.0,,A do not miss part of Singapore history. Be sure to take the guided tour. The commentary from the guides is invaluable. Also spend some time wandering the grounds of Ft Canning too
,,History being told,4.0,,The tour guide was very good in her detailed telling of the history of the Battlebox. My only issues would be not enough time to read the exhibits and this is not really the tour to take younger children on as it spoils it for the others who are there to listen and learn.
,,Excellent guided tour.,4.0,,"A fantastic insight into the fall of Singapore, but not quite enough time to read all the very informative posters and photos, as the group moved from room to room"
,,Hidden History,4.0,,"Amazing historical site,great tour and guide.must see for WW2 enthusiasts,good alternative to Changi prison as this was being renovated."
,,"Visit to the Battlebox, September 2018",5.0,,"An excellent experience. I stopped off in Singapore for 24 hours on route to Australia and prioritised a visit to the Battlebox, which did not disappoint! The facility has been lovingly restored, yet easily retains the semblance of pressure, panic and inevitability of those horrific days of invasion and its aftermath. The information panels are comprehensive without providing information overload or becoming tedious. Our tour guide was informative, factual, and with excellent communication skills. A visit that will remain long in the memory. I have only one suggestion to offer: that is, the Battlebox might usefully produce a quality souvenir booklet of say 12-16 pages summarising the information provided on tour together with providing some quality photographs. This could provide an additional income funding stream, although it is recognised that this would necessitate initial printing and publishing costs for the Battlebox trustees, but I'm sure the Government of Singapore tourist office could be encouraged to provide some financial support? Ian McKee, Newtownards, Northern Ireland."
,,History relived,5.0,,"This is an excellent insight into a very significant WW2 event, well organised with a very knowledgeable guide"
,,The Battlebox Singapore,5.0,,"In our recent visit to Singapore we tried to find information about Changi prison camp but without success - apparently it is currently closed for restoration. Having originally lived in Britain and being old enough to have lived as children through WWII and having relatives who were imprisoned during the war, we take more than a passing interest in history of that period. We were extremely fortunate to find information and to visit Fort Canning Park and the Battlebox, the actual spot where the surrender of Singapore took place. Our guide was well informed and the life like figures depicting the event displayed in the rooms brought the reality of the event very much to home. An excellent display and in our opinion well worth a visit. Many thanks to our guide."
,,Stepping Back in Time,5.0,,"Although I have been to Singapore many times I had never bothered to visit the Fort Canning area . I was pleasantly surprised to find the Battlebox. Our guide Matt, was extremely knowledgeable about what happened here so many years ago and his presentation was informative and professional. Well done"
,,Visit to battle box,5.0,,I found the visit very informative and helped me understand the history of what happened during the war.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,As an alternative to the obvious tourist things to do this was well worth the visit. If you have an interest in world war 2 history ibwouks strongly recommend the bamttlabix tour. Just check the internet for timings of the tour before you set off.
,,We couldn’t understand tour guide,3.0,,We did the tour today but didn’t understand the guides english as he talked too fast and with a very very strong accent. We zoned out after trying several times to understand what he was saying. It would be better if you simply got audio devices for people to rent like they do at many other attractions around the world . The guide could be there for additional questions. We did ask him to speak slower but he couldn’t.
,,"Perfect length of tour and amount of information given, guide was friendly and informative.",5.0,,"We really enjoyed this tour and had read all the positive reviews which were all accurate to our experience. The directions given for us to travel there by MRT were excellent. It was a great experience and we learnt so much about the surrender of Singapore, really made you understand as much as possible what people went through. There were children on our tour but it wasn't too graphic which was good, it focused more on the events that lead to the surrender. Very interesting tour, glad we did it."
,,A great history lesson.,5.0,,"This is a very well preserved and interesting part of WW2 history. If you are interested in the fall of Singapore this is a must, The tour guide was excellent. After the tour walk around Fort Canning Park very interesting history set in wonderful tropical gardens."
,,A Treat for History Lovers,4.0,,This place is situated on a hill. The venue is superb full of nature. The guided tour takes you through some historical incidents and if you're a history lover it indeed is a treat for you.
,,"Fateful Day, February 15, 1942",5.0,,"February 15, 1942 was the fateful day that British Officers surrendered Singapore to the invading Japanese Armed forces. The Battle Box complex located in Fort Canning Park was part of the British Command Headquarters during World War II and provides a very real reenactment of the events that lead up to and during that fateful day. The guide we had was very knowledgeable and provided insight and commentary on the invasion of both Malaya and Singapore. Well worth taking in for both history buffs and those wishing to be better informed on the tragic events that occurred in Singapore during that period."
,,Interesting tour in WW2 Singapore history,4.0,,A good description from the guides on the sad history of the English forces in Malaysia & Singapore up to the surrender. Interesting to see the small spaces available inside the Battlebox and hear about life inside it.
,,A must for all tourists.,5.0,,"This venue is superb, very well done, a peep back in time, world history was created here, if u do not go and have a look, you will miss out on something well worthwhile."
,,No photos allowed inside,1.0,,"A rushed, guided tour with no photos allowed inside the museum. We would not have taken this tour had we known this in advance. To reach the museum, you can take the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station to Fort Canning park."
,,Fantastic and educational,5.0,,"Great guide, tonnes of information and a real insight into the invasion of Singapore. Would recommend even to those who aren't into history."
,,Battlebox Singapore: WW2 history,3.0,,"The Battlebox, Singapore is a fascinating aspect of WW2 history - the underground bunker that was the allie's command centre prior to the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese. Forgotten for many years, it is now open as a museum with a comprehensive display reflecting its function, the history of WW2 Singapore, and the surrender. All visitors attend via a guided tour, and that is one of the limitations of the museum. The tour I attended felt rushed, with the guide moving the group on constantly before we had time to adequately read and digest the information in each room. Admittedly it was the last tour of the day, so perhaps that is why. Others I have spoken to have not felt the same way.The setting for the Battlebox museum is Fort Canning Park, which is itself interesting and so it is worth spending some time exploring the area and some of the history of Singapore settlement reflected in information panels in the park. Easily accessible by foot from downtown Singapore."
,,A history lesson,5.0,,The guide was really personable and the tour was very informative. The wax mannequins depicting the events of the time really added to the atmosphere. Our kids are 7 and were a little bored but well behaved and managed to learn a little about history.
,,A must do,5.0,,Could not recommend this tour enough. The tour guide (Joanne) was very informative and knew her history and didnt make it sound like a verbatim story. Very well preserved and interactive tour. Was great. Plus it was nice and cool underground after being so hot outside.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,A great insight into Singapore during WWII. Our guide knew the history well and was very engaging with the group. If you're interested in history this is worth a visit.
,,Informative Tour of the Battlebox,3.0,,"I rated the tour as average as Photos were not permitted inside the Bunker, had I known I probably would not have taken the tour. Having said that the Tour was informative as I now understand why the decision to surrender Singapore to the Japs was decided by Lieutenant-General Arthur Ernest Percival and his Senior Command."
,,A gem,5.0,,"I happened on the Battlebox during an Internet search for something to do during a day’s layover in Singapore. It looked interesting so I gave it a go. The building structure itself is interesting but the history of why it was built and the historic events it was involved in was even more so. Our guide, Nancy, did a great job of animating the history of the Battlebox and of the wider events in Singapore during the war through her descriptions. These were always delivered with her wry sense of humour, which was appreciated. All in all a great way to spend an hour and 15 minutes in Singapore."
,,"Informative, mix of recreation & actual video from the time",4.0,,"The combination of recreated scenes using realistic, life-like dummies and scene setting plus actual footage from the relevant times makes this tour incredibly interesting. The tour guide was knowledgable and presented the information well. Had a great time.

My only concern was the inability to take photos. Not sure why it is so, but I would have liked to have some memories of the tour."
,,Matthew,3.0,,"Last Monday we joined a group of English speakers for a tour of The Battlebox. Matthew, our guide was presumably knowledgeable about the relevant facts, however, there was one major problem. His delivery of those facts was like rapid machine gun fire which was totally incomprehensible! We would have preferred to have followed arrows and had time to read all the interesting displays for ourselves. To be whisked through so quickly by a guide whose English delivery was beyond appalling was extremely disappointing. Its a fascinating place but not in the care of Matthew sadly!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We went to Battlebox and took the guided tour. You can’t access the bunker unless you take the tour. The tour lasted for 75 minutes and I enjoyed every moment. The guide was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, the videos and reconstructions were very engaging. The directions to the location which we found on their website were excellent. If you’re interested in the island’s war time history then this tour is a must."
,,Wonderfull insight,5.0,,"I thought I know my world war two history quite well nut this certainly opened my eye's to a few things about Singapore. Great story, well told & well played out. Looking forward to going again. Great place to get out of the midday sun or as happened to us, a Tropical rainstorm. It really was good."
,,Joanne,5.0,,"Joanne was an excellent tour guide - she was informative, detailed, told the Singapore story with passion and suspense as we moved from room to room, so much so we were looking forward to the next room to see the next part of the story! When we finished the tour, it felt like we have just watched a movie! Thank you so much Joanne for such an enthralling experience!"
,,Informative piece of Singapore historty,4.0,,Very informative piece of Singapore history well worth it for history buffs. Nice park surrounds as well.

,,Battlebox Visit,5.0,,Xcellent Love The Tour and Learn Something That I’ve Never Known Before. The Bunker Is Well Presented and Well Ventilated.
,,Take a walk through history!,5.0,,"This is the kind of history you remember: the kind you experience first-hand. In a little over one fascinating, fast-moving hour, I learned just about everything I need to know about Singapore's role in World War II: the lives of the men in that sprawling bunker complex, the hard choices of the commanders, the reasons for the quick surrender... The history is still there, from the gaps cut into the doors to the marks left on the walls. Our guide was friendly and knowledgable, and the Madame Tussaud's worthy figures are a nice, humanizing touch, right down to the occasionally stunned looks on their faces.

Bottomline: This tour is a great (and blessedly cool) way to escape the Singapore sun—and heck, even learn something!"
,,Battlebox tour,5.0,,This was the guides Joanne’s first solo tour and she was fantastic - highly recommend this tour ! Very interesting and great no phones allowed diring tour which was great

,,The battlebox was brilliant!,5.0,,One of the best things we’ve ever done on our numerous visits to Singapore. It’s a super interesting 1 1/2 hrs of history spent in the cool of an underground war bunker. Of great interest to Australians & other nationalities who fought in the Fall of Singapore.
,,WW11,5.0,,Excellent coverage of this bit of history. I am hard of hearing so had some trouble with the accent of the very capable guide so would have liked more time to read the extensive material on display.
,,Loved the history,5.0,,If you are into WW2 this is a must . Great knowledge by the guides and a relaxed no rush tour . Oh and underground great way out of the heat
,,Interesting History,5.0,,"We arrange to do the "" A story of strategy & Surrender"" guided tour on 26/7/18 which was guided by Chin Han. Great tour guide and certainly enjoyed the experience and learnt a piece of australian history we did not know."

,,An insight into history,5.0,,An intriguing insight into Singapore’s history. The guide was informative and knowledgeable. A varied use of media to help the visit. Try to link this to a prior visit to the National Museum which will set the context for the Battlebox visit. Highly recommended
,,A great museum,5.0,,Wonderful informative reinactment of those times. Well worth a visit. The room layout and the wax figures were extraordinary. Our guide was brilliant and informative talking us through each stage and room. I did not know it was a private museum perhaps that’s why the attention to detail was so good. Keep visiting as they need your contributions. Everyone should go.
,,A strategy of surrender,4.0,,A worthwhile tour of the headquarters bunker system from WW2. Complete with life size wax figures recreating the surrender meeting and operations room amongst the Signals support staff at the time. Regardless of the country of origin this is a view of the battle designed not to offend the visitors. With a visit.
,,"Very interesting tour, but self guided would be better",4.0,,"This is a really good place to visit if you're going to a Fort Canning. Having a tour through the battlebox is good and recommended. However you only get to see some of it, you don't have the opportunity to walk round all of the rooms."
,,History Site,5.0,,Hello we were happy with our visit. History is always very interesting and this site has a lot of history that relates to our way of living as it could have ended up very different except for our brave young soldiers. I believe all youngsters should visit this site.
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"You could almost feel what the atmosphere must have been like during those final days, simply outstanding experience."
,,Fake News,5.0,,Your tour put to rest a lot of the misinformation that has been circulated worldwide about the circumstances surrounding the surrender. Having said that it still appears that there were a lot of poor decisions/planning etc made by the command during the short lived campaign.
,,Walk back in time,5.0,,Great experience with a professional and informative guide. Enough information to understand the history and emotions of the huge decisions being made without overwhelming you with facts you could not just take in. Really well worth a visit.
,,Fascinating tour with Battlebox - our guide made the experience really great!,5.0,,"Well organised tour and definitely worth the $18 ticket. I have to say our guide (I think Aysha was her name), was what made it so interesting and come to life - she was great."
,,Highly recommend visiting Battlebox,5.0,,"An authentic experience, with a tour guide that nailed his presentation to the floor. It was that good. Not to be missed if you are in Singapore ."
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,"An excellent expose of the British military headquarters and its attendant support facilities relating to the World War 2 Malaya and Singapore campaigns. Reconstruction of key events and operations with life sized dioramas. The guide was very knowledgeable and approachable. Highly recommended for anyone with even a passing interest in history. Please note that photography is not permitted in this facility - as it is privately run now, the owners have copyright on imagery. Booking in advance is recommended, as the periodic tours can fill quickly. I would also recommend a good look around the rest of Fort Canning Park, especially for the hardcore enthusiast."
,,Really Great Tour,5.0,,"Our guide, Joanne provided an excellent account of the wartime life, events leading up to the surrender, the surrender to the Japanese by Percival, POWs, life under Japanese occupation and the surrender of the Japanese. The one hour tour was jammed packed.
The Fort Canning Hill bunker or Battle Box as it was known, was the command centre for the allied forces in Singapore. It was well presented with plenty of life size manikins, that looked real, in poses around the war map and meeting room, as well as other places.
The Information Centre had some brochures and books about the times but not well stocked. Their staff are friendly and keen to assist.
The surrounding parklands were also very well laid out and kept in pristine condition. Ideal for picnics.
It is easy to get there. Just type in or look for Fort Canning Park on your map. It was only about a 15 minute walk to there from near Sentosa Island area."
,,History wonder,5.0,,A great little visit. Matt our tour guide was very knowledgeable and good host for our tour. A well planned tour with matts facts and videos throughout. Learnt a lot about the surrender of singapore to the Japanese. Would recommend if interested in history or to cool down underground.

,,Battlebox a hidden gem,5.0,,"We just happened to noticed this was a attraction in Singapore while searching attractions to visit, we decided we would go and visit was so worth it and was a real eye opener in the history of Singapore. I would recommend this as a must visit while on your trip"

,,Excellent Visit and Do the Extended Guided Version,5.0,,"I arrived not knowing you needed a guided tour to see the place so came back at 14:00 for the 2.5 hour extended tour they provided on Mondays and Thursdays. The guide was great and very informative. You will see a lot more than you would on the regular tour (which runs more often) so if you are there on a Monday or Thursday, show up at around 13:30 for this tour."
,,Moving experience,4.0,,A poignant and well thought-out presentation of a crucial moment in wartime history. Fort Canning surrounds are worth a look too.
,,Interesting and Informative,5.0,,"You can only access Battlebox through an organised tour but it is so worth doing. I didn't have a huge amount of knowledge about what happened in this area during the war so I came away a lot more informed. The way that the information is passed is very visual - there are tableaus depicting what went on in each room along with videos, photos and artifacts which lend themselves to the brilliant commentary given by the tour guide."
,,Interesting historical visit,5.0,,We came here years ago when the mannequins moved in a rather ghastly way. Theses days it’s run by the nearby hotel and is a guided group tour and a fascinating inside into a dark event of the British empire. We had Nancy as a guide and she was wonderfully enthusiastic and knowledgeable.
,,One of Singapore’s outstanding attractions,5.0,,"Whilst walking around Singapore we stumbled upon the Battlebox Visitor Centre and decided to join the tour of the Battlebox Bunker that was just about to commence.
The in-depth tour includes going down into the bunker and being guided through each room and the events that took place leading up to the British surrender to the Japanese during the 2nd world war. Our guide Irdianty, was very knowledgeable and kept the entire group mesmerised for the entire duration.
I highly recommend this attraction when in Singapore"
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"The Battle Box Tour came as a very welcomed break from the hustle and bustle of Singapore. Darshini, our tour guide, provided some excellent insight into the challenges the Allies faced in defending Singapore, and eventually surrendering to a tactically savvy, and well resources Japan during WWII. It was well worth the visit! Much of Canning Fort Park is lovely to wander through also."
,,How history should be taught,5.0,,"With a mixture of oral, visual and interactive elements all taking place in the actual bunkers where it occurred, it was enthralling. A never to be forgotten 90 minutes."

,,Interesting tour,5.0,,Joy made the tour interesting with her account of what happened leading up to the surrender of Singapore. Hard to imagine the significance of this moment in history and being in the space where decisions had been made supported our learning.
,,Historic side of Singapore,5.0,,"The 1:20 min trip is a refreshing experience after all the skyscrapers and busy city life. The whole Fort Canning Park is an island of paradise encircled by the city itself. During the Battlebox trip, we will learn about The Battle of Singapore, also known as the Fall of Singapore, and we will have the chance to fully understand what led the bigger Allied forces to surrender to a much smaller Japanese army."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"great to know the history of the fall of Singapore during WWII, and the predicament and difficult decisions that needed to be made. Loved the ending of the Japanese surrender and the same 2 military leaders present at the both surrenders (Allied and Axis')."
,,Brillliant must do,5.0,,"We started with a walk around Fort Canning Park to explore the British Barracks and Headquarters ( now a lovely Hotel). The absolute highlight was the 75 minute Battle Box experience. Our guide WanJun brought to life reality and history of 2nd WW, significance of Singapore and tough decisions of war. Truly a must do activity to understand what happened thru out SE Asia. Given the
Modern city it helps us appreciate the past."
,,"Very informative well worth the money, great for history buffs. Best to get there early as limited places on the tour",4.0,,"Very informative well worth the money, great for history buffs. Best to get there early as limited places on the tour"
,,super fun!,5.0,,I was wandering around the park and had no idea this little gem was hidden under the hill. What an amazing surprise. I got to learn about a part of history I have never been taught at school. Super interesting and fun to hear all about it. I would really recommend it to anyone that is curious about History.
,,History comes alive,5.0,,The Battiebix is definitely worth a visit. Check tour times and spend an hour reliving history. Our guide was brilliant - very informative and kept the tour moving. Each room was well kept with displays and there were also old movies. I really enjoyed it.
,,Touching history,5.0,,"The tour felt like we were taken back in time and were part of history. Our guide Joanne had an amazing understanding of what took place and her communication skills were perfect. For all history buffs and for anyone with just a bit of curiosity, this tour is a must."
,,Exceptional wartime history,5.0,,"Our tour through the Battlebox was extremely interesting - our guide Matt was so knowledgeable and verbally led us through this harrowing time in SIngapore, in 1941-2, which precipitated the invasion by the Japanese army and then the momentous decision of the Singaporeans and the Allies to surrender during World War 2.
Although we are reasonably informed about this period in history, Matt told us so much more that we didn't know. Thank you Matt!"
,,"To understand Singapore, you need to understand a bit about its involvement in WWII",5.0,,"If history is your thing, don't miss a visit to the Battle Box in the Fort Canning area while in Singapore. Although I am actually not a war junkie, to understand the history of Singapore, you need to understand Singapore's involvement in WWII.

Ryan was our tour guide on the day I popped in and was able to pay the $18SGD to jump on the 4PM tour. I am so glad I did. Your ticket price helps take care of the Battle Box and you cannot step foot inside without a ticket and without going on a tour. The tour takes about an hour and 15 minutes. The Battle Box itself is directly behind the Fort Canning hotel. It is also located into Fort Canning Park, which is a lovely place to simply walk around, enjoy the greenery and take in the history of this area. The Battle Box is located within maybe a 15-20 minute walk from the Fort Canning MRT station, but do note that a good chunk of that walk is vertically up a hill or up stairs.

Ryan was an excellent guide. Not exactly jovial, but absolutely well versed in his docent skills and pays excellent attention to the historical details and information he is giving you. There is a lot of information to understand to understand the significance of the Battle Box and he really did a professional job in disseminating that information in a laid out manner that was easy to understand.

The tour itself involve walking down a set of stairs into the Battle Box, walking around the 20 or so rooms encased in this Fort Canning hill and some occasional stops to sit and view short videos. There are no restrooms down there for public use. The temperature is cool, for there is air conditioning. The space itself is very impressive and although there are replicas of furniture and stuff, the structure is very well maintained and preserved.

Along with the old Ford Factory museum, I found the Battle Box Museum and the tour to be absolutely excellent."
,,Must Visit when at For Canning Park - even if you don't like history or war,5.0,,"Built during the British days in Singapore, the structure was designed to serve the British Army as an operations bunker. The place has since been converted to a museum that contains real World War 2 relics and also scenes depicting the final days of the Battle of Singapore.

I recommend taking the guided tour as its really informative. You can walk alone for sure and at time times you get an eerie feeling but that's just me :)"
,,Battlebox at Canning Hill Singapore,5.0,,Great museum even with children from age 8 I guess. Gives you an overview on the power and military structures of the ancient to modern times Singapore and an in depth picture of the dramatic days and minutes of the toughest decision in the live of the leading British officers at command in Second World War ... as it is a bunker you really can feel it.
,,a glimpse of the past,5.0,,Excellent museum piece and great to see where the final battle for singapore was fought from a Staff offcie perspective. The whole Fort Canning is an excellent walk and the little museum at the end of the Battle Box has some really good momento's and WWII branded items (the playing cards are well worth the purchase)
,,interesting history of the fall of Singapore,5.0,,informative tour of the invasion of Singapore by the Japanese set underground would have liked to spend a bit more time looking around by myself
,,Taking Battlebox tour at 11am,5.0,,"Very enjoyable. Tour guide was well informed, articulate and had a pleasant manner. Airconditioned Battlebox rooms were most welcome! Amazed at how unprepared Singapore was to defend itself, despite valiant attempts made by local forces to obtain reinforcements. The 'enemy' was so sadly underestimated by both local and overseas forces."

,,Entertaining and informative,5.0,,"Absolutely loved the experience. I recommend that people do this on their first day in Singapore to have a historical background about the country. Our tour guide, Joanna was excellent."
,,Great even for the non-WW2 fan,5.0,,Visiting the Battlebox was my husbands choice for the morning activity. I must admit going in I anticipated to be bored for the next hour. I was wrong- and so pleased to be wrong!!! The presentation (via a guided tour) keeps you engaged with an interesting story outlining the historical events leading up to the surrender of Singapore and the actually activities/ living conditions in the Battlebox. Our guide Matt did an excellent job of keeping us moving through the rooms and relating the history. I would highly recommend a visit for any WW2 enthusiast and can assure the rest of you it’s a pretty cool site and worth your time to check out.
,,A Stunningly Good Tour!,5.0,,"We were in Singapore for just four days. Walking around Canning Fort we discovered The Battle Box Tour. What a find! The presentation was the most balanced and comprehensive I have experienced anywhere and I have traveled the world extensively.Growing up as a an Australian child of the 1950s I heard a lot about WWII and conflict in South East Asia in particular. The story of the defeat of the British lead forces in Singapore was often retold. The ""Battle Box"" tour was far more detailed and factual that anything I had previously heard or seen.The wealth of factual information, the stunning realism of the recreations of the military meetings and activities, the video presentations and the photographic displays make the tour a ""must see"" on any trip to Singapore."
,,"Excellent, evocative and informative",5.0,,"If you're looking to learn a bit about the history of Singapore and Japan in WW2 then this is the place for a comprehensive start. The underground bunker itself is very interesting but it was brought to life by our knowledgeable tour guide, Ryan. The films (three short ones, les than five minutes each) too, are excellent and complement the information from the tour guide very well. Even our thirteen year old was interested! There’s a lot of standing so it may not be suitable for those who may find it difficult. Thoroughly recommend this tour."
,,Interesting and enjoyable historical tour,5.0,,"BattleBox, located in Fort Canning Park, is a former WWII British underground command center that is very well preserved as a museum and is very interesting. Note that you can only view the bunker with a guided tour that are scheduled at specific times throughout the day. It was well worth the cost because our tour guide was fantastic and the tour was very well structured and very informative!"
,,A great insight into the history of Singapore,5.0,,We did a tour of the Battelbox. Our guide was amazing and gave a really comprehensive tour of the facility and the history of that period of time in Singapore. One of the best tours I have done.
,,Interesting history,4.0,,"Worth a visit to learn some interesting history. Well presented. If you are finding it a bit hot in Singapore, the Battlebox is well ventilated with great aircon so a good place to cool off in the middle of the day."
,,"Great price, great detail, fascinating tour! Well worth every penny!",5.0,,Joanne gave a fantastic tour of the battlebox and went into great detail of the fall of Singapore!

,,Must see for anyone interested in WW2,5.0,,"The Battlebox is one of the most evocative and well researched museums in Singapore. Our guide Nancy was excellent, giving an insightful overview of the facts and providing interesting background stories. We visited with one pre teen and an older teen who also found it interesting and thought provoking."
,,Perfect!,5.0,,"Small, efficiently run museum. The guided tour was extremely interesting. The guide (Matthew) was an expert but shared the information in a very dynamic and interesting way. They have kept the history alive and share their enthusiasm in a very enjoyable way. Hightly recommend this to any family visiting Singapore who want a lot more than just shopping! We visited with our 9 year old daughter and she loved it too."
,,Tour,5.0,,I had a personalized tour of the facility and it is a very worthwhile visit for anyone but especially historians of the war in Asia from 1941 to 1945. One of best kept secrets in Singapore.
,,Great historical experience in Singapore,5.0,,"My sister and I loved visiting the Battlebox. The tours were group tours that you had to book onto. However, you don't need to book way in advance - we showed up maybe 20min before the tour began and got onto the tour with no difficulty. The tour took about an hour.The tour was excellent and our tour guide spoke excellent English and was very knowledgeable. It was really interesting to go into the bunker where the short lived resistance to Japanese invasion was commanded. We tend to know more about the war in Europe rather than Asia for the Second World War, so it was really nice to learn more about this theatre of the war. It was an excellent experience and we would highly recommend it to others!"
,,Fascinating with good guides,5.0,,Excellent way to spend 1h15mins learning about the secret bunker and Singapore’s experience during ww2. The guide - a young lady - was excellent.

,,Absolute must see!,5.0,,"Went on the Battlebox tour with my boyfriend last month.Matthew is a very enthusiastic and knowledgeable guide, and could answer any question thrown at him!This was a definite highlight of our trip to Singapore."
,,Visiting the past,4.0,,"SET IN the hilltop location of fort Canning this historic location was the site of true history in early 1942 when British Army surrendered to the Imperial Japenese Army. Very factual and interesting sad that all the exhibits are only copies of the original fittings as the site was stripped after the war. But you can't remove the history from the walls and this is the real deal.
The guide Jing Jing was very well informed and knew her facts overall a great visitor attraction"
,,A must to do on your list,5.0,,"Wow, so much history here. My son loved every minute on hearing about the Pacific war and how the British surrendered. Our tour guy was very informative A real must to go and see"
,,A must do,5.0,,Excellent guide told in just the right detail the story of this pivotal time in Singapore's history. Very informative and interesting
,,Battle Box,5.0,,"Great guide who really knew every aspect - small group was good so there was time to ask additional questions. Really liked the fact that the tour was broken up with film, walk and talk and exhibits."
,,Excellent and Air Conditioned!,5.0,,"Excellent and good overview of the campaign, history and key figures involved. Well worth a visit. Nice Gardens at the Hill too."
,,Excellent historical attraction,5.0,,"My travelling companion and I visited Battlebox last week. I had booked tickets for the 2.45pm tour online. The instrucions to the venue on the website were easy to follow- we caught the MRT to Dhouby- Ghaut station and walked from there. The last part of the walk is up 4 flights of stairs. We did get there very early to collect our tickets ( they recommend 20 minutes) and were able to slot us into an earlier tour. On arrival I found that we were able to use our Singapore Explorer Pass to pay for the entry ( $18 adult).

You are not able to take photos inside- this may have been because it would slow down the tour group. The tour takes place underground and we were standing most of the time. The tour guides are very knowledgable and take the tour group through the area where the allied forces managed WW2 prior to the Fall of Singapore. Short video clips with historical original footage were interspersed with visits to different rooms within the Battlebox. This is a relatively new attraction and I believe it will only get better with more money invested in it.

Though this was quite an emotional visit for an Australian, I really enjoyed the visit."
,,Battle box 1hour tour,5.0,,This was very informative tour and presented very well by our guide. Gave a good insight to some of Singapore’s history in the 1940’s.. After the tour we had a delightful walk down through Fort Canning Park to Quay Clarke.
,,A must-see,5.0,,"A great-value attraction. Very informative. Suggest making the effort to see this first, as it gives a good sense of how Singapore has developed culturally and economically."
,,Back in time,5.0,,"If your interested in a bit of history about the Second World War from singapores side this a great place to start,the viewing of the bunker is by guided tour only and what a guide we had his knowledge was outstanding. The tour takes you through various blocks of the bunker with some rooms setup as they would have been during operations for the war, the tour lasts for about 75 minutes and gives you a great insight of day to day activity and what happened within Singapore and why up to the surrender."
,,Really interesting overview of last few days of Battle for Singapore,5.0,,"Visited with my teenage son and with friends and their younger children. All age groups enjoyed, the tour was interesting and engaging.
My only complaint would be the lack of ability to book online- we had tried to visit previously with my father, only to find it was booked for that session and given the location we could not face the walk up the hill again! Booking online would have saved us that wasted journey"
,,Sobering experience,5.0,,"Set out to visit the Battlebox and discovered Firt Canning - the whole site is fantastic.
Our tour guide was exceptional - he was clear, full of information, humorous and entertaining. The Battlebox tour is well set out, has insight into the time of Singapore’s surrender and Japanese occupation. We very much enjoyed the tour, even though I was brought to tears on a number of occasions."
,,Informative and interesting,5.0,,"I was in Singapore for a few days, but felt like it was wasted on a solo traveler such as myself. Trip advisor recommended this tour and I’m glad I went. I carry a good amount of interest in the events surrounding WWII. Like the other reviewers suggested, generally speaking, the pacific side of war is less covered in the literature.

I was glad I found this tour, as it gave me an insight on the side of war that I never investigated into.

I recommend taking a walk here since the walk is beautiful. I also recommend arriving about ten minutes earlier because the tour starts on the dot.

The artifacts inside the bunker are well preserved. As an engineer, I was really interested in seeing the systems that ran this underground bunker.

It was also interesting to learn that this was the biggest capitulation (in numbers) by the British army in recorded history. I got to see Japan’s propaganda for the first time, too.

Overall, I highly recommend this tour."
,,A highlight of our Singapore trip,5.0,,"I was worried our teenager daughters wouldn't enjoy the tour but they loved it. Our guide, Chin Han, was very informative and he mixed his facts with humour. We class this as one of the highlights of out trip to Singapore."
,,Very relevant tour,5.0,,"I attende the battle box tour with my two teenage sons, who had a very basic knowledge of WWII in the this region. This tour ensured that they appreciated the relevance of Singapore in WWII, the suffering of its people and the little choice the Military Commanders had, but to surrender!

Tour guides was very knowledgeable and I would highly recommend this tour.
Thank you"
,,Great!,5.0,,An interesting tour and a very good guide. It would have been good to have a little more time to take in the displays but overall a worthwhile trip.
,,WOII: historic look behind the scenes of the Singapore defence,5.0,,"Very clear explanation by tour guide (Dian). Realistic set up using video, life-size dummy's in an historic environment.. Attitude from multiple perspectives, good sence for drama."
,,Love battle box,5.0,,"❤️❤️❤️ I like this place and got knowladge a lot. If i come to singapore, i will visit battle box again."
,,A Truly “Must Do” Tour,5.0,,"Sha was an amazingly well informed and professional guide with a passion for Fort Canning, the Battlebox and all things World War II. He made all the facts and figures come to life for me who was very ill informed about the effect of WWII on Singapore as well as my husband who is a military historian. Sha is to be commended for his sensitivity to all aspects of the various roles the countries represented by our group played in the fall and liberation of Singapore, and we would say if you only had time to do one tour in Singapore, this should be it."
,,History,5.0,,This was a great tour. The guide was very knowledgeable and passed this on to us. He answered any questions with pleasure.
,,Battlebox Tour,5.0,,We were surprised at how amazing this tour was and very emotional. Watching the footage and seeing inside the tunnel was a great experience.
,,Awesome informative tour,5.0,,"Great tour to learn some of Singapore's WW2 history, guide was informative with a touch of humour now and again. Would definitely recommend"
,,Amazing Tour Of The Battlebox,5.0,,"This is a must do tour. Definitely worth the $18 for the Battle Box Guided Tour. You are taken into the BattleBox underground to see what it was like to be in there during the war.

It truly was an amazing tour and our tour guide ""Chin"" was great. He was very informative and made the tour very interesting. I learnt alot from this tour so much that I went to visit the other war history site at the Old Ford Factory at Upper Bukit Timah Road. Which is another exhibition that recounts the events of the British surrender, and the Japanese occupation of Singapore. I was not aware of this being linked to what was happening at the Battle Box during that time. Truly Amazing.

They also have a small gift store which has some great books about Fort Canning and other sites.

Transport to Fort Canning to visit the BattleBox is very easy as there is now a ""Fort Canning MRT Station"" on the Blue line and from here its only a few minutes walk through the Fort Canning Park to get to the entrance. The park is a beautiful place to walk around, heaps of trees.

Thank you again to ""Chin"" for being a fantastic tour guide and to the staff at this location."
,,Excellent tour,5.0,,We had a guided tour and had an excellent guide. He was able to answer every one of my questions and was very knowledgeable. We learnt a lot about Singapore's history and significance during WW2
,,"Great tour, learnt more about Singapore in WWII",5.0,,"We learnt more about the fall of Singapore. The tour was very well presented by Jing Jing, she was very knowledgable and her personality kept us listening intently."
,,Middle of Singapore,5.0,,Just near Clarke Quay this is a great piece of history but make sure you go on a tour and enter in the right door. It is underground tunnels but not claustrophobic at all.
,,A Must See for History Enthusiasts,5.0,,"The Battlebox Tour was a fascinating insight into the decisions made by Percival in February 1942. To be present in the building where the Allied Command was based, made it very ‘real’. It was an excellent tour."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"Very good overview of Singapore’s ww2 history and who was involved. Includes a tour of the bunker, talks from the tour guide and some videos. If you like history, you’ll like this"
,,An excellent journey into Singapore's past!,5.0,,"The Battlebox located at For Canning Hill is an excellent spot to learn about Singapore's past, specifically how events unfolded towards the end of the British rule over Singapore. The Battlebox runs daily tours (I took the shorter of the two) and was suitably impressed by the guide, the interior of the bunker (incl. the statues, materials, videos etc.) and the overall experience. The bunker is also very well-kept and the air-conditioning is excellent - there were about 20+ participants and it never once felt stuffy.

My tour lasted slightly over an hour and during that time, I learned a lot of Singapore's history and in particular, the role and importance of the Battlebox (and Fort Canning). It was an eye-opener and made all the better by the very informative and pleasant guide. The tour itself was interesting as we explored several rooms within the Battlebox and saw depictions of what life must have been like for the British commanders and officers during the end of their rule in Singapore.

I would definitely recommend a visit to Fort Canning Park to anyone who has some interest in Singapore's history and its strategic importance (especially around World War II). And, in so doing, a visit to the Battlebox is a must! Make sure you allocate some time for the tour - it was definitely time and money well spent for me!"
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"The Battlebox is found in Fort Canning Park and can only be accessed by booking for one of the guided tours. There is a bus stop right beside the visitor centre. The tour guides are extremely good and there is a good mix of auditory and visual so you can see the background on the single largest cock-up by any country in living history when an army of 120,000 men were delivered to the Japanese. . No drinks or photography are allowed inside. The tour takes approximately 1 hour 15 minutes. Not suitable for disabled as access steps to the bunker are not wheelchair friendly and there is only one entrance."
,,History well worth remembering,5.0,,The commentary and videos added to the visit in a memorable way. Realistic additions with lifelike characters added to the story.
,,Great tour,5.0,,"The 1 1/4 hour tour provided a detailed insight into the circumstances around the Fall of Singapore- the Allied Forces surrender of Singapore to the Japanese inWW2. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and balanced nicely with short videos, artefacts and some mannequins recreating the scene. Entry to the Battlebox is by tour only, so it maybe advisable to book ahead.
We are not serious war buffs, but nonetheless found the tour to be enlightening and interesting.
Hint: you may wish to visit the restroom prior to your tour, as one is not available in the bunkers.
A nice extra is that Fort Canning is a big peaceful park in the middle of bustling Singapore, it is worth a quiet wander around for its own sake."
,,A must see,5.0,,"The Battlebox is well worth a visit to come to understand the many reasons for the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in WW2. Well managed, good displays and a well informed young guide."
,,Well worth a visit.,5.0,,We thoroughly enjoyed our tour of the Battlebox in Singapore. We took the shorter of the 2 tours available (approx. 1.5 hours). Our guide was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the history of the site and the events that took place there during WW2. A very important piece of history that is well worth taking the time to explore.
,,Easy way to learn a part of history,4.0,,"My teenage son and I participated in the guided tour. I had no prior knowledge of how Singapore figured into WWII, so it was very enlightening. The tour is about an hour or so, and it is cool in the bunker, so it was quite pleasant. We were in Singapore for 5 days, so it worked with our schedule. If we were only there for a couple of days, I wouldn't have it at the top of the list."
,,Battlebox - A window into Singapore's WWII history,5.0,,"Battlebox is a bunker complex under Fort Canning hill in Singapore. Used by the British in the period before Singapore was captured by the Japanese, it is part of the sorry history of how the Japanese forces were underestimated. The bunker complex has been carefully recreated; it is possible to join one of a number of tours each day. The tour docents are well-informed and clearly interested in their work re-telling Singapore's history. It's a couple of hour's well-spent."
,,The Battlebox,5.0,,"Came into this with thinking what happened should never have happened however after an hour with our tour guide Matthew I completely changed my mind.

With his range of knowledge on the matter he put across a very informative tour that was helped with props and artefacts from the time.

If you like your world war 2 history this is a must see!"
,,Battlebox good but needs more work.,4.0,,"We took this tour last week and it is worth a look. I note that it is relatively knew(2016). It is a very significant event from WW2 but think it needs more work. The tour guides give a lot of information, but speak too fast. They need to give a build up and sense of drama and engage their audience more. Although different Churchill's War Room gives a good base to work off. Of the actual area it is at top of hill, hot and when you get there there are no seats to wait for tour and it is limited to 25 so may have to wait. The kiosk should be expanded to a bit of museum for more background to deliver sense of anticipation and maybe show the effects on general population. Don't mean to be negative just feedback to improve."
,,Fantastic tour,5.0,,Fantastic tour of the underground command centre in the heart of Singapore. Tour guide was very knowledgable and gave a great account of WWII in Singapore and the events that led to it being surrendered in 1942. I am not a history buff but found this a fascinating tour with just the right amount of information. Whole family enjoyed it. Tour lasts c 1.5 hours. We did not pre-book but just turned up and got the next available tour time slot.
,,Detailed Explanation and,4.0,,The explanation of the tour guide is so in-detail and I have learnt a lot from the tour. Yet the tour guide spoke too fast and sometimes I could not hear clearly what he said.
,,Good overview of Singapore’s history,5.0,,The guide was informative. The pace of the visit was just right. The program could be enhanced by allowing the visitors to take their own time to look around a bit.
,,Surprisingly good,5.0,,So glad we did this. Really cool history with outstanding guided tour. Numerous videos that paint a great picture of what it was like facing the Japanese in the 40’s. Don’t miss this

,,A great piece of history well worth the visit.,5.0,,Ryan was a fantasic tour guide who was very knowledgeable. We enjoyed the tour very much and thought it was definately one place in Singapore that all tourist should visit.
,,Davis Family Singapore vacation,5.0,,Visited battle box recently during family vacation to Singapore. We all had great time tour guide was wonderful & would highly recommend it
,,Battlebox Tour,4.0,,"Absolute gem. We thoroughly appreciated the story and presentation. So much information in a detail packed 75 mins. Terrific local female guide. We just wish there was more time to absorb all the resources. Remarkable value for money. Take the 0945 tour as the group may be relatively small.
I recommend this for all.
Lew - South Australia"
,,Really enlightening,5.0,,The highlight of Singapore for me in terms of tourist attractions. I'd heard of the fall of Singapore but had no idea of the circumstances and what it actually meant. This brought it all home.
,,Worth the trip,5.0,,I enjoy history and knew some of the wWII Singapore history but the battlebox is a must see for anyone who enjoys history I have also visited the Missouri where the surrender was completed and didn’t know Perceval was also there.
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Great tour at the Battlebox. Joanne was an excellent tour guide, extremely knowledgeable. The battlebox was excellent"
,,A glimpse of History,5.0,,As a History teacher this was a fantastic place to visit. The tour guide was very knowledgable and the displays were excellent. This is a must for anyone interested in World War 2 and the Fall of Singapore.
,,Memorable,5.0,,The Battlebox was recommended to me by a colleague and I'm very happy I listened to her recommendation. Our guide was very informative and professional and the staff in the shop were friendly. Hearing about the events of the war in that atmosphere was fascinating. I would recommend The Battlebox to anyone interested in world history.
,,Battlebox tour,4.0,,Interesting to learn about the history of Singapore. I felt there were probably too many people in the group - around 20. Lady guide was excellent.
,,Really interesting. Worth taking the time to see,4.0,,The battle box displays the history behind the British surrender of Singapore during world war 2. The circumstances in the lead up and what happened afterwards. Our guide through the display was very good and the crowd was a mix of all ages. Certainly suitable for kids and adults
,,Battlebox Top Marks,5.0,,Excellent & thoroghly interesting insight into Singapores history & surrender during the Second World War ! In fact a must visit well organised & well presented 1 hour & 15 minute tour.
,,Battlebox in Singapore,4.0,,"Very interesting tour with an excellent , knowledgeable guide who knew her facts and made very interesting.Gave a real insight into what it must have been like in those times of the British surrender to the Japanese in WW2 and how awful it must been for the locals and Allied forces.If you enjoy WW2 history I recommend this for a visit."
,,Fascinating insight into Singaporean recent history,5.0,,Thoroughly enjoyable and fascinating view of the relatively recent history of Singapore. Guide was so knowledgeable that we felt we could have asked him anything.
,,Fascinating tour!,5.0,,The Battlebox tour appeals to all ages and well worth a visit if you are in Singapore. Our tour guide Joanne was happy to answer any questions and very knowledgeable about the history of the area. Highly recommend.
,,Very interesting & informative tour,5.0,,"The Battlebox can only be accessed through a guided tour, which takes 1h15mins and is very frequent through the day. It usually sells out each tour so get to the office about 20 mins early to book your slot.

Our guide, Diah, was really friendly and very knowledgable during the tour. You are walked through the bunker areas, including strategic rooms and living spaces, and there are also some video presentations about the invasion of Malaya and the defence of Singapore before its invasion. I will say that the tour is quite lenient and sympathetic to the British army officers' situation, and focuses purely on the Japanese invasion and the surrender of the British. Due to the bunker's original purpose, of course the tour does not go into depth about the Japanese occupation of Singapore, or the eventual liberation of the island. This is a good overview of the start of the war in Singapore, and then there are other places to go to learn about the later war years.

Once you have seen the tour at the Battlebox, you can explore the rest of Fort Canning Hill, as there are paths with information signs around to learn more about the military base situated there."
,,A Great Insight into the Surrender of Singapore,5.0,,"The tour was very informative and the status of both the Japanese and Singaporean (and allies) forces was described in great detail by our guide. The underground facilities shown were realistic and gave an excellent insight into the conditions experienced by the allied forces.
We recommend the Battlebox Tour to anyone interested in the war history of Singapore."
,,Battlebox,5.0,,"Took our 9 year old son who loves anything to do with war, army etc and he loved it and so did we. Very informative and our tour guide was awesome. Highly recommend this. Great bit of history"
,,Great tour,5.0,,"Great tour, full of good information and very well presented. Staff are very informative. Would highly recommend."
,,Fascinating Attraction,5.0,,"The Battlebox in Fort Canning, Singapore is a relatively small space but packed full of history of the last days of Allied control of Singapore and the events of the surrender to Japan.
Our tour guide Matt was very knowledgeable and friendly although he spoke very, very quickly, which made it hard to follow at times."
,,Highlight of my recent trip to Singapore,5.0,,As an interested person in all things war related this tour was excellent. The guide was very professional and knew his brief perfectly. The bunker (Battle box) was intriguing and hard to imagine how so many people resided in the place at the time of 1942. The museum had just the right amount of reading material as well as short movies to assist with the explanation of how the surrender came about.
,,Knowing the details,5.0,,Everything was so well done. Enjoyed every minute of it.I was not aware of the circumstances of what happened. I was born in 1947. My Dad had built an air raid shelter underneath the mango tress in our yard. (just in case) I am in awe of the soldiers who had to make such far reaching decision. It must have caused them great trauma. Certainly to have PTSD. Also to the presenter. She did an excellent job.
,,A wonderful insight into the Fall of Singapore.,5.0,,"We visited The Battlebox, beneath Fort Canning Park, a few years ago and enjoyed it then, so after it closed for a major refurbishment, we returned and were taken through in a group with a wonderful guide. Taking an hour and with the help of videos, documents, artefacts and the knowledge of our guide we gained an insight into the lives of these men while they lived in this maze of rooms nine metres underground and made important decisions about the war with the Japanese. The wax-work figures were life-like and the recreation of their work in communicating with their superiors above ground very interesting. We were almost waiting for the phones to ring or for them to talk. There was so much to learn about the history of the Fall of Singapore and the men involved that we were thankful for the books in the gift shop at the end of the tour. A wonderful recreation and well worth the visit."
,,Insight into little known history,5.0,,"This tour was a great surprise. It was very realistic, going through the actual tunnels from the WW2 period, with well set out displays, and our guide was knowledgable and able to answer questions."
,,Amazing tour,5.0,,Great tour of the bunker. Interesting to learn more about the role of Singapore in WWII. Kids found in fun and educational
,,The Singapore Sacrifice in WWII - upclose and personal tour,5.0,,"Our guide Sharul gave us an insightful and educational tour of the Battlebox and more importantly gave us a better understanding of the sacrifice and critical role Singapore played in World War II. To understand Singapore, is to understand its rich history. This is a very well done tour, and way to see Fort Canning Park, while understanding the historical significance of this beautiful, hilltop park in the heart of Singapore. A must see!"
,,The Battle Box,5.0,,"An amazing tour, giving great insight into Singapore's military history and struggle during WW2. Very professional, well informed and friendly tour guide. A must see on a Singapore holiday!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Very good and worthwhile,,,, exceeded expectation,,, recommended ,,, tried to book online on the day but not possible said not available but concierge booked at hotel"
,,A very interesting and informative tour,4.0,,"My dad was visiting and it was perfect for him. I also enjoyed it. The bunker is kept cool, the guide was very good and there is a lot of background info available. They just need a coffee shop next door!"
,,A Must Do,5.0,,"This was a fantastic experience and I would heartily recommend it. It was fascinating and informative. The tour guide was brilliant, full of knowledge, well organised and with a delightful sense of humour. The $18 was certainly well worth it. We got there an hour before the tour, but it was already full so we booked for th next one. In the two hours we had to fill we walked around the park exploring the area and discovering the history of the site through the various storyboards on the property. All in all a great afternoon. However it would not be suitable for anyone who struggles being undergrond."
,,Just go....its brilliant...you wont regret it!!,5.0,,I thought this was THE best tours ive been to. The model rooms show lifelike depictions which give that
,,A really great tour!,5.0,,"Wonderful visit with guide Matthew, very informative and educational and also very interesting on parts of Singapore (and World) history that we had not explored before. The bunker itself is also a great place to visit and see. It has been very well maintained and set up as a great exhibit, including videos, artefacts and mannequins without compromising the reality of the history."
,,Fascinating tour; really worthwhile,5.0,,"This is an interesting and very worthwhile 90 minutes and a must see if you are visiting Singapore and are slightly interested in history. You can only visit on an organised tour which takes 75 mins but they pack a lot into this time. It provides a very good overview of the battle for Malaya and Singapore and the events that played out leading to the surrender of Singapore by the British to the Japanese. It also covers briefly what happens to the main players on both sides after the fall of Singapore up until the surrender of Japan.

The tour guide we had was excellent. The tour uses short videos, presentations on the walls in the bunker and then the tour guide to provide a fascinating account of the last days of British rule in Singapore. The tour groups are small (15-20 people) and only run at set times in the day and therefore it is important to book ahead (you will need to phone them) as they do sell out. The day we were there some people just turned up and were disappointed as they had to come back for a later tour as the one at 11am was sold out."
,,Interesting but with limitations.,4.0,,"I've never been in a WW2 bunker before so this was a very cool experience though the photo/camera prohibition was quite disappointing...Also you can't tour the place without a guided tour which has its pros and cons.
Pro: guide speaks good English, is very knowledgeable & provides interesting details.
Con: guided tour may at times feel stressful when you just want to sit and admire the artifacts.
All in all a good experience but with its limitations."
,,Excellent for the history buff,5.0,,Guided tour through the underground rooms of the Battlebox. Informative and interesting with wax like figures of the personnel to make it more realistic. My husband loved this tour.
,,Enlightening tour,5.0,,"Tour and guide exceeded my expectations. With my limited knowledge of war history in Singapore, touring the underground bunker and listening to the extensive knowledge of our guide was very interesting. Would definitely recommend this tour to anyone visiting Singapore."
,,So worth it!,5.0,,My girlfriend and I stumbled upon this while visiting the park and it was a great tour! There was a little something for everyone and lots of unknown parts about WW2.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"This was a special place for us to visit and a must see if you are in Singapore. The lady who was our guide was informative and extremely knowledgeable, the bunker themselves are extremely well looked after and the stories and replicators made you feel like you were really there. A must see"
,,Very interesting,5.0,,Couldn’t do Changi prison as it was closed so decided on the battlebox. So good. Has been restored and is very organised. The guide was excellent. I knew a Little bit about the surrender of Singapore but didn’t know about this place. Was well worth the visit
,,Battle box,5.0,,"Excellent experience, guided tour was great, well worth the price of admission Learnt a lot about Singapore’s history"
,,Excellent History lesson,5.0,,"Getting to walk the grounds of the British HQ was very educational, giving a greater understanding of what conditions were like. The guide spoke flawless English and was very informative. He explained the history that went down in this facility with great enthusiasm and detail. I learnt a lot from it."
,,The underground history of Singapore,5.0,,I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Battle Box - which had been recommended by friends and family. The guide was excellent and very informative. The tour was exactly the right duration and I did not feel rushed around. I then spent some time looking round Fort Canning Park which I also very much enjoyed. I thought it was excellent value for money.
,,Great history lesson,4.0,,"Matthew was our very knowledgeable guide, and provided a comprehensive account of WW2 events in Singapore and surrounds. He talked rather fast, and could perhaps have injected a bit more animation and fun for the younger ones on the tour with us. We did follow his advice and wandered around above ground to find the other historic structures. An enjoyable morning."
,,Insight into WW II incompetence,5.0,,Certainly not hi tech but a fantastic history lesson about the English failure to defend Singapore in the weeks following the bombing of Pearl Harbour. A little difficult to find from the MRT but well worth the visit.
,,Good insight into the Japanese occupation of Singapore,4.0,,"We opted for the longer 2-hour tour of the WW2 bunkers run by 'Singapore Walks'. Really interesting, but the initial two hours blew out to nearly 3-hours due to the over-zealousness of out guide. Don't get me wrong, it was really interesting, but 3 hours is a long time to spend listening to stories! Take the tour if you are interested in history, as it does really provide a good insight into the war and occupation years."
,,Great Experience,4.0,,"Great experience, our guide new a lot of information and could answer any questions that were thrown at him. I loved the set up of the characters. Great detail!"
,,Surrender and strategy of singapore,5.0,,This was such a highlight. I love finding out the history of places and this was The quintessential place to get it. The bunker is the original in Fort Canning park and our tour guide had so much information regarding the surrender of the British to the Japanese. There are very good books for sale as well in the gift shop. 5 star. Go do it.
,,"Great tour, fun quiz at the end (you may win if you this review)",4.0,,The Battlebox is the name given to the Allied Command Center where Singapore was surrendered to the Japanese in 1942 in what Churchill called the “worst disaster” and “largest capitulation” in British military history. The only way to visit is on the guided “Battlebox Tour: A Story of Strategy & Surrender” which is well worth the S$18 ($13.38) charge. Hint: There is a “quiz” with a giveaway at the tour’s conclusion. The following information may be useful: in the picture of the surrender party the guide will show you in the Surrender Conference Room the soldier carrying the white flag is Cyril Wild and the Commanding Officer is General Arthur Percival.
,,Fascinating historical site,5.0,,"A unique glimpse into a pivotal World War II battle during an excellent, thorough tour - a must for anyone who enjoys military history."
,,Battle Box Visit,5.0,,My wife and myself who are both in our late 70's found this a most rewarding experience that every Australian should see
,,Lots of interesting facts,4.0,,Our family enjoyed the tour through the rooms in the bunker. There are short clips to watch and a guide who takes you through the invasion of Singapore and some of the lead up to that time. Wonderful that communications equipment and clothing etc have been preserved.
,,1st visit,5.0,,"The information from the guide was fantastic, entry price was worth it, the fact the original item were still in each room you could imagine what was going on a daily basis"
,,A LOOK BACK,4.0,,"A very interesting and must see insight into the military bungleings that resulted in the fall Singapore. The structure of the battlebox is much the same as it was at the time of the invasion, though much of the inner fittings have been removed. The videos and exceptional knowledge of the tour guides paint a vivid picture of the happenings of that time. The tours are guide led and limited to 15-20 people and therefore at set times that do vary from day to day, it is therefore recommended that you book in advance. If in the future the Battlebox could be returned to its original state , it would be a tremendous historical showpiece"
,,Interesting Tour,4.0,,We learnt new political strategic information about Singapours importance during WW2 and the subsequent surrender. Very well presented.
,,Paradise within the city,5.0,,We were not able to visit the Battlebox as they were making a film the day we were there. The grounds and gardens of Fort Canning were a real pleasure to idle around and take in the history of the area.
,,Understand what happened to Singapore in WW 2.,5.0,,Really well preserved Fort Canning.Insightful military history and the decisions that had to be made before the British surrendered to the Japanese. Most Aussies will find this very moving. Excellent value. Very informative guide takes you through the underground fort.
,,A Glimpse into Brittan's Worst Military Defeat,5.0,,"A very well run operation. Tour guide was informative, interesting, and able to take questions ""on the fly"". Very good displays. I would have enjoyed a little more time to review the printed items on the walls throughout the tour, otherwise; just perfect!"
,,Excellent Historical Tour,5.0,,Lucky to be the only participant in the battlebox history tour. The guide Ryan has done a very good job in explaining the history of the Battle of Singapore as well as various information about the battlebox. The only downside is the tour is too short and wish I can spend more time inside the bunker!
,,Battlebox at Fort canning Singapore,5.0,,"The long walk up the hill and stairs was worth the effort. An enlightening view of events leading up to the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese and why Gen. Percival took this action. Our guide was very knowledgeable and very easy to understand. It is important to pre book if you can but, if not, lunch at the Fort Canning Hotel next to this facility can be a worthwhile stop."
,,A must do for History Fans,5.0,,"I really enjoyed our tour of the battle box, our guide was very informative and made the whole tour interesting. I think that visiting the Battle Box is a must for anyone interested in learning about Singapores history and what happened during the war."
,,History explained,5.0,,A visit to this historical site was extremely enlightening. Entry is only by a guided tour and our young guide was extremely knowledgeable. Various exhibits detail the struggle to defend Singapore and the eventual surrender culminating in the command room set up as was at the time with very realistic figures.
,,'The Battlebox' in Singapore.,5.0,,Wonderful study of how not to prepare for a determined invader ! So much wishful thinking by all the Allies which could really have gone terribly wrong for the world for a very long time. The Fall of Singapore and what it meant for Asia and the world is crystalised by the story of the Battlebox. Well done.
,,HISTORY COME TO LIFE.,5.0,,"We did not make it to Battlebox this visit but have been many times before, For those who remember when Singapore fell in 1942 it is a must visit.....it was very emotional for me because I remember it happening, brings it all to life and evokes memories of a very sad time...if you love history this is a must ......"
,,A must see attraction,5.0,,"Our visit to the Battlebox proved to be one of the highlights of our recent holiday in Singapore.
Situated in a beautiful Park, the museum was well sign posted and easily accessible.
We waited in the gift shop for our guide to take our group down into the Battle box, it was a very interesting tour, our guide was very concise about Singaporean history, she also gave us time to look at the artefacts on our own. We thoroughly enjoyed this tour and left feeling as though we had learned so much about the history of Singapore."
,,Battlebox,5.0,,We completed this tour during a recent trip to Singapore and it was excellent. Our guide was brilliant and had such a passion for the subject. We’ve been to the Battlebox before on a previous trip but didn’t join a tour then but have to say we gained so much more from this trip. The tour group was small with just four of us but this made it far easier to ask questions which our guide was more than happy to answer. Highly recommended
,,Excellent and Informative,5.0,,"We did the Battlebox tour on 15 June. It was excellent and well worth the money. A very informative tour led by an excellent and well informed tour guide (sorry can't remember her name) who knew her stuff and presented it very well. We would thoroughly recommend this tour to others, particularly if you have an interest in 2nd world war history. Well done the Battlebox. A hidden gem (with apologies for the pun!).

,,Great History turn alive,5.0,,"It is a private museum , and it is doing great to keep history alive , the staffs are very professional and did a great job explaining during the tour ,it is an unforgettable experience"
,,"Thought provoking and well presented,",5.0,,"The guide knew what they’re talking about, and the displays were really well done; we really enjoyed ourselves!"
,,Great Information,4.0,,"A fantastic tour, with heaps of information. Things we did not know and amazed that it all took place such a confined place. Amazing !!! A pity we could not buy a DVD with all the information and also photo's to show others, so they would also go and see it all for them selves."
,,Great historic site. Worth while visiting,5.0,,Learn the history of Singapore during WW2. Brilliant and informative tour. The guide was well versed in Singapore's history.
,,Battlebox Tour,5.0,,"A must on your visit to Singapore. Mat our guide, was wonderful, very knowledgeable and willing to answer our many questions. I certainly came away with a different perspective on the history of this important site."
,,Our visit to Singapore,4.0,,The Battle Box was a very interesting and informative part of our stay in Singapore The only negative was that the guide spoke so quickly that we missed some of the facts. He was a wealth of information.
,,Follow the script,4.0,,"We enjoyed this tour. It was a surprise very close to our accommodation. Very interesting learning about the fall of Singapore but the tour was a bit short. I’m sure there could be lots more to show. Also when questioned the guide couldn’t answer questions beyond the tour script.
If you’re interested in the war in Singapore.i’d recommend you do this tour, check out Fort Siloso on Sentosa Is and do the WWII tour with Carol Dragon. That way you can get an appreciation of what the Singaporeans, Aussies, Indians and Brits went through in 1942."
,,Enjoyed our visit to the Battlebox,5.0,,Was spur of the moment but so glad we did this. It was really informative. Our guide was great. Would recommend.
,,Hidden gem,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed the guided tour and would certainly recommend it to others.
Our guide was energetic while leading us around, very knowledgeable and easy to listen to.
Overall, very well staged, telling the story in a relatively short period of time with the use of photo's video's and excellent life models and props.

We had a small group of 7 which was excellent, suggest getting tickets early"
,,Battlebox is worth fitting in to your holiday plan,5.0,,"We enjoyed the tour underground at the Battlebox. The tour guide was a pleasure to listen to and obviously enjoyed and knew her subject. It was good to get a visual perspective of the events leading to the fall of Singapore, right through to the Japanese surrender. A step back in time."
,,A Little Known Piece of WW II History,5.0,,"Having a great historical interest in WW II history I knew when I came to Singapore I had to discover the history of the British and Japanese struggle on Singapore in 1942. Not knowing where to begin my search for the story of this epic battle I searched on Google and found the Battle Box. It was the perfect, most complete historical presentation from the perspective of actually being able to tour the command center of the battle. The guide's presentation as we explored the corridors and rooms of the bunker was outstanding. She was very knowledgeable and able to bring the history to life. I Learned so much from the tour. Well done! I plan to return and visit again, as well as recommend the Battle Box to my fellow travelers and historians. Thank you"
,,Battlebox Singapore,5.0,,"A fascinating piece of history hidden near downtown Singapore at Fort Canning Hill. The curators are making great efforts to present this World War II historical site as it would have been in 1942 together with informative photos, documents, videos and displays including very life-like mannequins posed in activities from the period. The tour guide was knowledgeable and helpful. My only wish would be for more information including the maps and photos to be available either in book format or online for further review and study as there is inadequate time to fully appreciate all that is available during the guided tour. This is a must see for anyone who appreciates history and is a great educational resource."
,,Never forget,5.0,,Most of think about WW2 as being fought in Europe. We forget the devastation it brought to smaller countries like Singapore. I am so glad we included this tour into our visit. Exceptional value. We learned a lot. Highly recommend you visit.
,,Well Done.,5.0,,We didn't know what to expect but the fort was wonderful to see the history of Singapore related to the defence of the city. Not high tech but well displayed. No cost but a good visit if you have the time to go.
,,education,5.0,,Very good insights to singapore history and it is very value for Money Recommend for all families with children
,,Fascinating view into a difficult time.,5.0,,"The excellent guide took us through a fascinating period in the history of Singapore. Brought to life by the artifacts and models in the rooms. As my father and father in law both trained as doctors in the late 40s, it was very interesting to see some of the equipment they would have used. Highly recommended."
,,Amazing visit,5.0,,We had a brilliant time visiting the Battlebox. I must admit my husband was the one who wanted to go and I wasn’t really bother but I’m so glad we went. I really enjoyed the tour.
,,Battle box,5.0,,Visited Battlebix in Singapore. Very interesting and enlightening quire. Learned a lot more about the surrender in Singapore. Well worth a visit if you are in Singapore
,,Excellent overview of the Battlebox,5.0,,"As an Australian Military firearms collector and Historian of firearms from both WW1 and WW2 this trip was to revisit areas of the Singapore conflict and surrender. Our tour was expertly done, comprehensive and enjoyable, the tour guides knew their history well and provided an excellent tour of the many 27 rooms of the Battlebox. It is great to see the preservation of our history good and bad. Bless all those that were sacrificed or suffered during this conflict."
,,The Best!,5.0,,This tour was one of the best we have done. The guide was extremely professional with great knowledge and responsive to the members of the group. Her presentation was excellent.The actual Battlebox is an amazing setup with models and memorabilia. All staff were very friendly. We thoroughly recommend this tour to everyone...a wonderful record of Singapore ‘s WW2 history.
,,Outstanding!,5.0,,"If you have a few days to visit Singapore and wanting to get a 'true' feel for its rich history and culture, you will have a much better understanding of struggle this small country endured during the WWII and beyond. The tour is well worth you time and money. I could write much more, but simply stating...visit this historic and very well done historical and iconic place while staying in the beautiful country of Singapore. Tips: Get tickets early, tours sell out. Use the restroom prior to the tour as not available for 1.5 hours. No photography is allowed underground. If you read about some of the WWII history in this region prior to your visit to the Battle Box, you will have a much better understanding of the tour; however, not needed. The tour guide will explain everything and answer your questions. Great tour...a must see IMO."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"This is a must see in Singapore. Lovely setting in Fort Canning Park and most informative world war 2 history of Singapore. Is in the below ground tunnels used in the war and lovely and cool whatever the outside temperature, We had a great and knowledgeable guide in NanCy."
,,Battlebox Singapore,5.0,,This out of the way place is well worth a visit. It’s not found on tourist information but is a very realistic site of the last place before the fall of Singapore. A visit is highly recommended but check the guided tour times before you visit.
,,QUIET HISTORY,4.0,,"Loved the tour, only complaint was not enough time in each area to view photos and read what was on walls. maybe time should be allocated at end of tour or else allow person to go with the next tour for purposes of reading if required as I understand not everybody wants to see it all. I learnt a lot about Australian participation in war."
,,Surprise in Singapore,5.0,,"My husband and I recently visited Battle Box whilst on a 3 day stopover in Singapore . We were most surprised and impressed with the presentation, the tour and of course the incredible history surrounding the events of World War 2 in Singapore. At the completion of our tour a staff member volunteered to call a taxi for us ! Definitely recommend a visit ."
,,Battlebox,5.0,,We had no idea why Singapore fell during the 2nd world war. Great tour and especially the commentary. I thought I knew a little bit about the fall of Singapore However it showed I had little to no idea or knowledge to the actual situation as it was then.
,,Guided tour of Battlebox,5.0,,"English speaking guide, very informative and it was very interesting to find out about the facts that lead to the fall of Singapore during WW11."
,,World war 2,5.0,,The visit and historic information was very informative. We new very little of the Singapore conflict . The visit was very interesting and the battlebox itself very good. Our guide was very good .
,,"Vist to Battlebox, Singapore",5.0,,"I had not heard of Battlebox until a few weeks before visiting Singapore. The vast majority of reviews were positive so i thought that it might be a worthwhile trip and I'm glad I went. Although my wife and I had a little difficulty finding where to get tickets to the attraction and just missing the compulsory guided tour in the morning we eventually got on the tour in the afternoon. The young lady who guided us was enthusiastic, cheerful and very knowledgable. I had not long before read a book about the Singapore capitulation and the young lady recounted these facts accurately and with some passion. The tour through the underground military operations complex was very enlightening and certainly gave me a different perspective on what the people in there may have experienced during the period immediately before the surrender of Singapore - particularly the vast number of people who eventually ended up in there - and the lack of adequate sanitary facilities for these numbers. The lack of air conditioning on its own would have been challenging in the heat of Singapore and in close, cramped quarters. Luckily today the air conditioning works admirably and gives visitors a respite from Singapore's heat. One item that stands out for us was the mannequins representing the main senior officers of the time. We found them very lifelike and they really added to the atmosphere being generated by the guide and the story behind the surrender. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed the guided tour and would certainly recommend it to others who may have an interest in this tragic period for Singapore. Even my wife enjoyed the tour and she usually doesn't have any interest in military history."
,,Very insightful tour,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the battlebox tour. They take you through rooms which were the center of command during the British defeat in Singapore.

Alongside a very decriptive tour there are lots of artifacts to look at and videos to give more context to stages of the defeat.

I would highly recommend."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,This is a beautifully maintained piece of history. It is of significant interest to anyone who enjoys military history but would be enjoyed by most. The lady who conducted the tour was very well versed in her subject and a pleasure to listen to. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Singapore

,,Excellent upkeep of the place,5.0,,"This is actually a return visit since few years ago, the place is still well kept and is definitely great for people interested in the history of Singapore and what happen during the WWII period. Would be great if they can bring back the free and easy tour instead of the guided tour cos the time given at each exhibition area is too short to fully appreciate the exhibits."
,,Battlebox,5.0,,"Very informative. Learnt a lot of previously unknown facts about the war and the Australian involvement. Excellent and knowledgeable guide. One of the best things I did in Singapore as I love history. Well worth the admission price, Good range of relevent books also on sale"

,,Fort Canning 'Battlebox' Tour is an experience not to be missed.,5.0,,"Must admit to almost on doing the ‘Battlebox’ tour, but so glad I did, it will only take just over an hour of your Singapore visit time but it is so worth it.
It was a privilege to be able to take a ‘step back in time’ and be given a poignant insight in to the history of the ‘Battlebox’ and the life of those who served within it and the surrendering of Singapore by the British to the Japanese Forces.
It was a sensory experience, enhanced by the excellent knowledge and ‘storyteller’ ability of our Guide, it was one hour that I won’t forget anytime soon."
,,Excellent Historical Attraction,5.0,,Fascinating attraction. The guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. Her English was excellent. Well worth the entrance fee.

,,Historical tour,5.0,,Very interesting tour of the Battlebox area. The guide was interesting and the history was told well.
,,Great way to touch the WW2 history of Singapore,4.0,,"Absorbing and informative, set in historic surroundings this is a fantastic attraction for all. The allied situation in February 1942 is brought to life with audio visuals, displays and still life figures. I had some knowledge of the surrender of Singapore in 1942 but I learned a great deal about the event and its consequences for the local people during the tour. Also there was the added bonus of walking through and enjoying the Fort Canning gardens to reach the facility. A great way to spend a morning!"
,,Fascinating piece of history,5.0,,I’ve visited the War Cabinet Rooms in London several times and although I’ve been to Singapore several times over many years did not know the Battlebox existed until my recent visit. It is a significant piece of WWII history and our guide brought that history alive during the tour. It is well worth the visit and the surrounding garden area and art gallery also rate a visit.
,,Great Attraction,5.0,,Great place to visit. Very interesting to see and hear all the history attached to the Battlebox. Cannot believe that at times 500 people were in such a small area.
,,Good slice of history,4.0,,One of the best history attractions in Singapore. You need to book tickets the day before or early in the morning to get on a tour at the time you want. Only complaint was that there wasn't enough time on the tour to read all the information on the boards.
,,A historical tour to World War II and the Fall of Singapore,5.0,,"A very good tour ( although an hour could be a little rush to survey the whole Battlebox). The guide is always friendly and there are video scenes to watch about the fall of Singapore. Various WWII items are on display , some are real and some are replicas of the original. Be sure to visit the Changi Chapel Museum, Bukit Chandu War Memorial and Fort Siloso (in Sentosa) for those interested to visit historical places in Singapore :)"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,A must visit whilst your in Singapore A great insight into the happings of the surrender of Singapore
,,Amazing,5.0,,An absolutely fantastic tour. So much information and we won the prize! It does book up so advance booking is esssential.
,,Great experience for the whole family!,5.0,,"The visit to Battlebox was extremely interesting and well organised.

In the case of Battebox, everybody enjoyed the facinating story of Battlebox and the historic event in Singapore during WW II. Highly recommended!"
,,History,5.0,,Learnt a lot about the surrender of Singapore in world war 2. Great guide ! The whole area of Canning hlll and the gardens are well worth the visit

,,Historic Experience,4.0,,Very enjoyable insight into British and World history. The guide was very informative and friendly and was open to all questions.
,,Visitors from Scotland,5.0,,"An excellent tour,with an excellent guide, Aysha, who made the whole experince so interesting and enjoyable. A high point of our visit to Singapore."
,,Interesting and informative visit,5.0,,"Visiting Battlebox during our trip to Singapore was not on my to-do list but my daughter who enjoys historical visits persuaded me to go along and I’m so pleased we did. We took a short walk away from the busier city area and found ourselves in the Fort Canning gardens which were so calm and peaceful. We were then lucky enough to arrive in time to book tickets for the next tour. Tours are led by guides only - you cannot just wander through unaccompanied. Our guide was a delightful young man called Matt who knew his stuff and kept us well informed. He was happy to answer questions. The facts about the Battlebox and the surrender are sobering and it’s a story in stark contrast to the splendour and glitz of many of the other tourist attractions in Singapore. All in all, a very memorable visit."
,,History brought to life,5.0,,"this is a must do while visiting Singapore. It is a very interesting and informing look at history, bringing you back to those troubled times of WWII"
,,Very nice,5.0,,"A wonderful preservation of the history. Congratulation for the sponsor and, in particular, for the gide. Very good explanation and the attention with the guests"
,,Battlebox and Fort Canning walking tour is excellent way to see this and more!,5.0,,"It is a walking tour for about 2.5hrs but we took 3hrs and it was worth every minute! This tour covers both a range of history from the Kings of Singapura (who knew Singapore had Kings!) to WW2. Not only is the range of history diverse so is the environments in which it is presented. You walk around beautiful gardens and grounds, see old cemeteries, see colonial buildings and see new and upgraded installations still used in Singapore today. The final section is the Battlebox itself which is a 29room bunker built by the British in 1938and was to be used for a place for senior command to go if war went badly. It was between the senior staff offices and the troops accomodation but very few knew of it. Knowledge was kept to a very few senior officers and had passwords changed every 12hrs. During this 3hr tour we were led by Shah who is a tour guide par excellence. He introduced himself and the 8member tour members, spoke clearly and loud enough for all to hear, was extremely knowledgeable and obviously loves telling the story of Singapore. It was also lovely to have him give us some of his personal history which includes being the grandchild of a Chinese woman and na Indian man when cross cultural marriages were rare. He then married a Thai girl! He was able to give us a very personal slant on things eg he had an Uncle on one of the little islands off Singapore invaded by the Japanese who lived through the occupation and whose sister in law was shot dead breast feeding a daughter. The daughter is still living and still has the scar on her head from the graze form the bullet! Shah is also in the Singapore military so has real life military knowledge as well as a love of history.
Highly recommended tour"

,,Disappointment,1.0,,"I booked this today - no mention that their credit card machine was down and arrived 30 mins before tour as requested. We were told cash only ! We had none and no access to a credit card machine ( told to walk back down the hill in 32 deg - 80% humidity ) I discovered the machine had been out of action all week ! This is Singapore !!!
Our last day and looking forward to it . So disappointing - surely they could have and. Should have fixed this problem"
,,Visit to the Box,4.0,,Well worth the visit and an important piece of history which unfortunately led to many lives lost for the remainder of the war both for the local civilians and soldiers captured. . Its only after you learn the full facts that you realise what an impossible position Singapore was in and how they were left out to die by Churchill and Senior command.. If it was not so serious it would of seemed like a black Adder farce Churchill expecting every one to fight to the last man .Ok for him living in comfort back in London !. It was criminal how poorly resourced the island really was to fend off the entire Japanese army .Well worth the visit get there early in the day as its not so hot NO pictures allowed !..
,,Tour back into history,5.0,,Very interesting tour. The tour guide was very informative and the exhibits around the site gave you a perspective of what happened at the time of the fall of Singapore to the Japanese.
,,Inspiring,5.0,,An inspiring look into the events of a terrible time in the history of the world. The guide was helpful and informative and the visit well worth while. The parkland around is worth a stroll and the views are excellent.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"The Battlebox is situated within Fort Canning Park and is definitely one of the must-visit of the site. It is well equipped with many displays, videos and artifacts for visitors to enjoy. What's more important is that the tour guide was very friendly, fun and knowledgeable in history. You will not be disappointed."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Well-perserved historical site with wonder guides explaining all the stories behind the building and how the British army lost the war against Japanese in WWII
,,History theough new eyes,5.0,,An amazing experience which gives you the opportunity to learn about Singapore’s rich history! It was worth every second!
,,Learning experience.,5.0,,We were recommended to go on this tour during an excellent tour of the Changi museum. We were not disappointed. A detailed and interesting description of the history of the Japanese invasion and the background to the Battlebox by a guide with a genuine interest.
,,Battle Box Singapore visit,5.0,,"Wonderful historic experience. I visited the site about 10 years ago, however it has improved significantly. Staff where very knowledgeable and friendly. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the military history of Singapore:"
,,Brilliant Battlebox,5.0,,I have been to Singapore several times but didn't even know about the Battlebox. Well worth the visit. I am planning to go back again next time I am in Singapore.
,,a step back in time,5.0,,"excellent and really interesting ,explores the darkest days in the history of singapore . now i know exactly what really happened and why. puts right all that you thought you knew about the surrender"
,,Fascinating little known history everyone should visit,5.0,,"Who knew? Go visit - really worthwhile seeing, very knowledgeable guided tour; extraordinary story & well preserved remains"
,,Excellent,5.0,,Really interesting: bringing World War 2 history in terms of Singapore to life. Knowledgeable and enthusiastic guide. Recommend.
,,Great tour,5.0,,"We all really enjoyed this tour and visiting Fort Canning Park. 2 children aged 9 and 11 also got a lot from it I think. The tour guides are actual historians and ours was animated, engaging and very knowledgable. It gives a great background to a significant piece of Singapore’s history, and the bunker is well preserved and presented. Highly recommended."
,,"An eye-opening, educational experience",5.0,,"The story of Singapore and World War II is something many visitors may miss, but visiting the Battlebox was a highlight of my trip, and I say that having spent 12 days in Singapore. Whether you are a WWII buff or not, this is a unique experience unto itself because you get to visit where the events happened. Good tour guides, film, and stagings in the various maze of underground rooms are all well done. Plan ahead as there are limits on the number taken on the tour. HIGHLY recommended."
,,Informative interesting visit,4.0,,"I'd get there early to avoid disappointment, the tour I wanted to go on was fully booked, so had to go back later.
Really informative tour of the bunker, a nugget of history of Singapore. The guide was really informative and there was plenty of time to look at everything and plenty of stories.
The grounds surrounding the battle ox are also really interesting to walk round.
You can't take photos but I like that because you listen to the guide and absorb more of the info, plus it keeps it interesting for visitors."
,,Very interesting and informative,5.0,,Our guide was excellent in explaining the history around World War 2 with supporting videos and artefacts. The underground HQ was atmospheric and made us aware of the conditions that prevailed down there. Well worth a visit.
,,Interesting and Informative,5.0,,Very interesting. I’m from the US and the fall of Singapore is not too well known here. This presentation increases my understanding of early WW II.
,,Fascinating trip back into the grim days of WW2,5.0,,Our guide was friendly and very knowledgable. We had a really atmospheric and interesting tour round the Battlebox.
,,VERY INTERESTING AND GREAT HISTORICAL TOUR,4.0,,"Had a few hours to kill and missed this place on my last visit to Singapore. Booked my tour and is was raining heavily I was the only one on the tour. I did not deter my guide though and he was able to give a really great personal tour of this historical bunker.
It was really interesting and the use of the slightly ragged and moldy mannequins helped to set the scenes in the various rooms. The tour took about 1.5 hours and I enjoyed it for the history. I would not bring small kids or a bored wife into this 'lockin tour'. Although you are in tunnels and underground it is not claustrophobic and smelly."
,,Very interesting insight into the fall of Singapore,5.0,,"Our guide Joanne was excellent, she spoke clearly and enthusiastically and we were caught up in the story of personalities. We arrived early (about 09:15 before the office opened!) in time for the 09:45 tour and there were only 5 of us on this tour. When we returned after our tour the next departure had about 20 people so might be worthwhile aiming to go for the first one of the day.
My only minor complaint was that we would have liked more time to read the interesting captions and look more at the photographs in each room.
There is a little quiz at the end of the tour and the winner receives a little momento. For some reason I was lucky enough to know the answer to her question - that particular bit of information had stuck in my brain!"
,,"WWII Historical Site, a must see for History Enthusiasts",5.0,,"Matthew was our guide for the approximately 1 hour tour and was extremely professional and very knowledgeable about the history surrounding this underground fortress. As we walked through the corridors to various rooms and locations we learnt about the importance the Battlebox played in Japanese invasion of Singapore and subsequent surrender of the British Army to them in 1942. Matthew gave us a wonderful running commentary of each area and this along with room dioramas, short films and printed documents on the walls made for a very informative and humbling insight into what went on under Fort Canning hill."
,,Excellent and informative tour,5.0,,"Our tour was guided by Joanne who was very pleasant and extremely knowledgeable. As you walk around the bunker, the tour is a mixture of commentary by the guide and film showing the events surrounding the invasion and surrender of Singapore. It really brought this momentous period of history to life and we learned a great deal. If you are visiting Singapore, the Battlebox is most definitely worth a visit."
,,"Battlebox, Fort Canning, Singapore",5.0,,"Excellent guided tour, very knowledgeable docent. Kind cleaner, Paul, showed us where to go and gave us tissues! The guide was word perfect with his commentary and answered questions succinctly. Very moving video footage of the surrender of Singapore."
,,Informative and interesting historical tour of the Battlebox,5.0,,"We visited the Battlebox and had the pleasure of a guided tour with Matthew who was extremely knowledgeable about the history of this underground bunker. I highly recommend that you add the Battlebox to your itinerary, especially if you are interested in military and social history and would like to learn more about the British surrender to the Japanese. Definitely worthy of a visit."
,,Highly recommended for a visit,5.0,,For those particularly interested in World War 11 and specifiaclly the war in the Pacific and how Singapore was affected this was highly educational. The tour guide was extremely competent and made the visit highly interesting. The Battlebox itself from where the British generals commanded the Allied Forces pending the invasion and surrender has been restored with great care and attention to detail. You feel as if you were there at the time and you come away with a much fuller understanding of those momentous times. Highly recommended
,,Excellent reconstruction of an Historical event,5.0,,Another well presented and well organised location with a guided tour which provides the facts of such an important event in the history of Singapore.
,,Battlebox and Fort canning tour,5.0,,Absolutely brilliant. Loved it. The guide was so knowledgeable and added some animation to a very sombre tour. Thank you
,,Very interesting I thought,4.0,,"I was fortunate to be staying at Clark quay right next to Fort Canning Park where you’ll find the Battlebox tour and museum I guess you’d call it.
IMO this is a must see if you have an interest in WW2 history and in particular the fall of Singapore to the Japanese who had the Allied Forces right over.
I did the 90 mins tour.... a little rushed so maybe 2 hrs would be better to give you more time to read the literature within.
Nevertheless, fascinating I thought and at 18 Singapore dollars I’d about £9, I thought it was a bargain. Go look it up on the internet then take a tour.... it’s worth it"
,,"The tour of the Battlebox museum was great, our guide, Mathew, was excellent",5.0,,"The tour of the Battlebox museum was great. Our guide, Mathew, was excellent, he was enthusiastic and friendly."
,,Reliving the momentous moments in history,5.0,,Bring history back to live. Highly recommend especially if you have school children. To be engaged in the drama and emotions leading to the pivotal moments of the century.
,,A must see for any age,5.0,,"Visited earlier this week, with no high expectations but found this fascinating. Our tour guide (Matthew) was very informative and explained clearly but in an interesting and sometimes humerous way. Cannot praise him highly enough and would strongly recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore."
,,Must see attraction,4.0,,"This place is brilliant. The tour guide knows everything about this place. When you want to know about history, this place shows you and you get to experience what it was like. The bunker is remarkably cool when down there, which we were told it wasn’t back in its day. The history you learn about what was happening in Singapore is truly brilliant.

You see so much in each of the rooms, the models in the briefing room sitting around the table are very life like. You get the feel of what was going on back in war time."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"This is a fascinating place. The tour is perfectly paced out, some really informative videos and good guides. It is a important and interesting slice of history."
,,Another Must Do,5.0,,"Regardless of your nationality, this tour should be a must do on a trip to Singapore. It describes the events that led to the surrender of Singapore during WWII and tries to explain some of the factors that led to the situation. It takes a neutral stance on the events and provides factual accounts of what happened before, during and after."
,,Fabulous !,5.0,,Even if you are not a history buff this is fascinating. You find the Battlebox inside Fort Canning. Buy a ticket at the office and take the guided tour. We had Joanne as our guide and she was wonderful. You will be given a great knowledge of the events that led to the fall of Singapore during WW11.Since Changi is closed for renovations this is a must if you are looking for that history. One of the best things we did in Singapore.
,,Fascinated young and old alike,5.0,,"Our family of two adults and two teens thoroughly enjoyed this tour. The guide was super knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his delivery. Although we were a smallish group (about 12 people in all), we did find that there was not enough time to stop and thoroughly read the additional information. Definitely a tour you can do in the heat of the day as it's underground. Well worth it."
,,Dramatic History,5.0,,"Mat took us through the bunker, to bring the dramatic history of the surrender of Singapore to life. After reading about the surrender some years ago, I had several questions, which the tour answered. Mat also corrected some misunderstandings, such as the naval guns only able to be pointed to sea. They were able to be swiveled, to point inland. The whole tour was fascinating, revealing what went on behind the scenes."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,Fantastic view into this underground bunker from the world war 2. The guide Matt was excellent. Tinged with sadness as I learned the bunker soldiers had been let down badly by Britain. However a wonderful time spent
,,Very Informative Tour,5.0,,Really enjoyed our visit here - very informative and interesting You have to take a guided tour to visit but to be honest this would be the best way to see the Battlebox in any case Highly recommended
,,"Immersion, restored, interesting",4.0,,You can only visit via guided tour. Just over 1h. A little pricey. Tours book up so arrive ~30 minutes before you want to visit. You can kill time in park. Guide was good within pre learnt limits of tour but wider knowledge was poor which was frustrating and disappointing after paying a reasonable amount of money. Interesting and well restored. Definitely recommended. Skips over some of the history but serves as a good introduction. The interested can read further if desired.
,,An Interesting Tour on Beautiful Grounds,5.0,,"The guided tour of the battlebox was both interesting and entertaining.The tour has a good mix of mediums to learn from (plaques, movies, tourguide, etc) which keeps thins interesting. It is really cool to see the bunker itself and walk around it, while also learning more about the specifics of what happened there. It is located on the grounds of Fort Canning which are beautiful and also nice to walk around. Highly recommend!"
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,"Visited on a Saturday afternoon. Only about 8 on the tour. Well put together with knowledgeable guide. Videos, dioramas and printed media used throughout. Perhaps a little more time with each exhibit would have been good but overall I learned a lot and would definitely recommend.
Fort Canning Park itself was interesting to walk around. Some beautiful old trees. Very hilly!"
,,Great tour,4.0,,"Extremely interesting. Guides were very knowledgeable. Not the best place to finish your war. Listen to the guide as they run a quiz at the end of the tour, you might win a small keepsake"
,,Excellent - kids and adults all loved it,5.0,,A fascinating tour. I didn't know anything about this area of WWII history before going and found this tour really brought events to life. A good option on a rainy day as the tour is inside.
,,"Fantastic tour, great guide, good information",5.0,,"This is one of the best historic tours I have done! The tour guide Matt was excellent - he kept the tour flowing well and answered all questions. The venue was interesting and popular, so get there early to secure a place on a tour!"
,,Fascinating structure and knowlegeable guide.,5.0,,"The ""Battle Box"" has a lot in common with the Cabinet War Rooms in London, not so extensive but equally important to its theatre of WW2. Now operated by a group that is clearly passionate about this period of Singapore's history, it is a ""must do"" for anyone interested in the 1941-45 Pacific War. For those who have not studied the period, it provides an essential primer delivered by a very well-informed ""docent"".
Currently, only guided access is available with 5 scheduled tours a day with a limitation on numbers (only 3 tours on Mondays, closed in the morning). Tours were full the day we were there and some latecomers were turned away. In the future, I understand that it is hoped to offer self-guided tours but in the meantime, given the relatively out-of-the-way location, it would be wise to book ahead by phone to avoid disappointment. Whatever you do, don't miss the experience."
,,A fascinating insight into a breakdown of leadership with tragic results!,5.0,,"I did this tour in 2007 and found it fantastic. I am back in Singapore at the moment (April 2018) and about to do the tour again. As someone who served in the UK reserves and is really interested in history, espieclaly as two of my great-uncles ended up prisoners of war of the Japanese following the fall of Singapore, I was really impressed at how the museum showed a blunt no holds barred reflection of how senior officers couldn't get along with each other and put aside their differences resulting in a terrible debacle. Well worth a visit."
,,Interesting couple of hours,4.0,,"Even if you're not a history buff, this is an interesting place to visit. The commentary was excellent and visiting the bunker was amazing. Hot walk to the starting point so allow time to get up the hill. The bunker itself is very cool."
,,Up close at a debacle,5.0,,"Fascinating (brief) tour...interesting details about communication structures, personality conflicts, logistical details of British command. There are a couple short films that are also useful, and our docent was also knowledgeable and engaging."
,,Fantastic tour of The Battlebox,5.0,,Excellent tour with a great guide. Very well done and set out. Thank you for an enjoyable day and keeping the history alive. Highly recommended!!
,,A must for history buffs!,5.0,,Great experience and well worth the trip. The guide was very well informed. The only thing we would have liked was some time in each room to read the wealth of information on the walls - we were rushed from one to another and never had a chance to read and look at maps.
,,Informative tour,5.0,,"I really enjoyed the Battlebox tour, it was very informative. I learned a lot about the lead-up & the circumstances around the surrender of Singapore.

I was also fascinated to learn about the commanding officer in charge of the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese, and his involvement in the subsequent Japanese surrender at the end of WW2 years later.

The tour moved through some of the bunker rooms rather quickly. I’m not sure if it’s possible to go back through at your leisure after the tour has finished, but it would be good if you could."
,,Enlightening,5.0,,For all visitors to Singapore this tour is a must.The guides are excellent and the video presentations piece together the dramatic events leading to the surrender of Singapore in World War 2.
,,Eye Opening History of Singapore's War Past,5.0,,"It was an eye opening history lesson on Singapore's war past. Not many Singaporeans knew the Battlebox existed. It was the command centre for General Percival during the Japanese invasion on Singapore.
The experienced guide brought our group on a tour of the outside areas, such as the external walls and gates, the spice gardens, Sultan Iskander Shah's tomb and excavacation site, before letting us into the Battlebox complex. It is an underground complex with many rooms. This place is an engineering marvel considering it was built in the 1930s. It had air ventilation allowing the soldiers to carry out their duties in relative comfort.
The tour gave me a deeper appreciation of the bravery and sacrifices of the soldiers as they faced the Japanese during the crucial months before the surrender."
,,An hour well spent,5.0,,"My 7-year old son and I walked up to Fort Canning on a Sunday morning to take the Battlebox tour.

It started promptly at 9:45 from the visitor centre and was conducted by a very knowledgeable and interesting guide.

The tour was a mixture of talks and videos on the build up to the Japanese invasion, the tactics they used and the way that the allied forces were forced back into Singapore and finally to capitulation.

Artefacts and photographs give a real sense of the desperation of the British in the final days of the battle and the eventual end of the war.

At 7 and interested in history I would say my son was only just ready to take the tour. Older children and certainly only those with an interest in history would be best suited."
,,Great tour,5.0,,"Very interesting tour. The bunker has been well preserved with a number of interesting artifacts, maps and pictures., Very knowledgeable and enthusiastic tour guide!"
,,Well worth the trip,5.0,,The tour guide was very informative. We went with our daughters aged 7 and 9. It was very interesting to learn about the history of the fall of Singapore. Well worth the visit.
,,When the darkness fell in Singapore,5.0,,"Battlrbox was the combined military HQ prior to the Japanese invasion & during all the battles that ensued all over Singapore, ending in surrender. A very moving & well presented tour by dedicated volunteers. It was both fascinating and stressful to think of everything the allies went through. It's easy to find the entrance in Fort Canning Park. The tour takes a bit over an hour & is well worth the time! After the tour you can see a range of WWII & old Colonial things of interest: the keramat, the time ball, the lighthouse, the sally port, the escape hatch, Jubilee Arches, graveyard, spiral staircase, well, 6 and 7 inch cannons, etc. You could easily spend a morning or an afternoon in Fort Canning Park including your tour of the Battlebox. The staff are all volunteers and every penny earned goes to maintaining the Battlebox, so they don't have any discounts for anyone. Their small gift shop has really unique things like a replica of the Surrender paper and some beautiful post cards of Fort Canning Park."
,,Fort Canning and the Battle box,5.0,,Fort Canning is situated on a hill very close to Clarke Quay and is accessible via walking trails which take you through a botanic garden setting with wildlife along the way. The fort is historic and dates from the 1800s but the battle box bunker was built in the 30s. During WW2 it was the nerve centre for the allied forces facing the Japanese invasion. The tour is well run by a knowledgeable guide and offers a look at the various rooms which made up this bunker. Scenes are recreated using wax mannequins and provide an insight into the days leading up to the battle of Singapore and the surrender. Definitely recommended for history buffs.
,,An excellent tour,5.0,,A must do experience as the only way you can see the Battlebox is by tour. Our tour guide was excellent and provided an incite full presentation on Singapore in the lead up to WW2 and the details about the fall of Singapore.
,,A great historical tour,5.0,,I was looking for a short tour and read about the historical significance of this place. The experience of walking through Battlebox and imagining what transpired during those months in the Second World War is something I will definitely remember from my visit to Singapore.
,,A do not miss,5.0,,This is a great place to visit if you like Military History! I go back every time I'm in Singapore! A great way to see how Colonial Singapore was involved in WWII.
,,A must when visiting Singapore,5.0,,Guide was knowledgeable as he led us through this amazingly preserved and presented sensitive site; a must for visitors young and old.
,,Informative and engaging guided tour,5.0,,"We arrived for the 75 minute guided tour costing S$18 each. Our guide was word perfect, speaking clearly and at the right volume to ensure our full attention and understanding, We were guided through the many underground rooms of the Battlebox and given a detailed account of the fall of Singapore to Japan in 1942."
,,Take the tour - learn the history!,5.0,,"Despite visiting on a Saturday, we were surprised by how busy the tours were. Our advice would be to make sure you arrive before the tour you'd like to take part in so you can book on to it. We chose the hour long tour of the bunker and it was well worth it. The guide was interesting and informative. The combination of static models and use of videos made it varied. Air con and being underground made it cooler but it was still fairly tiring!
We had also walked some of the grounds beforehand. They are also well cared for and worth a look if you have the time and stamina"
,,A must visit,5.0,,"Every first visit ti Singapore should include a tour of the battle box . Our guide was brilliant and gave us a historical understanding of a difficult time while at the same time he gave us some amusing insites of the time including some of Singapore’s early history.
Don’t miss this and book in advance if you can.
We took a taxi up the hill and walked down afterwards"
,,Peek into the window of history,5.0,,"A tour of the Battlebox at Fort Canning provides a window into the history relating to the fall of Singapore in February 1942. The warren of rooms have been restored to the period, supported by photos and story boards on the wall. Our guide Matthew took the time to explain the history of this hill (long before the British) right through to the decision to surrender to the Japanese. It is a conducted tour, but there was enough time to read the interesting material in each location.
Located in the middle of Singapore city, this attraction is well worth the visit."
,,The tour is worth it!,5.0,,I had no real idea of the history of Singapore. This well restored battle planning area is complete with many exhibits and easy to understand explanations of the last days of Singapore before it was occupied
,,Very cool musuem off the beaten track.,5.0,,An excellent museum that deserves more publicity. Touring the Battlebox is educational and fun. The staff does a great job explaining what occurred here. Well done!!!!
,,A great tour.,5.0,,To understand a place you must know the history. This gives a glimpse to the horrible days of WWII and the events and suffering of Singapore.
,,Not everyone’s cup of tea,3.0,,"I took my 75 year old uncle on this tour. He thought it was great. Easily the best thing he did in Singapore.

For me, I found the whole tour dramatised to the point of ridiculousness. A much better experience would have been a self-guided walking audio tour similar to what they offer at the fabulous Chinatown Heritage Centre.

* Pluses - Easy to book online. Air conditioned. Only takes an hour. Cheap at $18. Good reception area and little shop.
* Minuses - bathrooms are quite a schlep up the hill. Not easy in the heat though partially shaded. Rushed.

For our most recent guests interested in Singapore’s WW2 history I took them to the National Museum and Fort Siloso. I rated the museum but wouldn’t rush to repeat Fort Siloso (but would recommend to others)."
,,Eye opening,5.0,,"Amongst the hustle and bustle of Singapore there is a recent past that all should be aware of and the sacrifice, pain and suffering that the allied forces and population went through during WW2. My great Uncle was one of the Prince of Wales crew that was sunk and made it back to Singapore only to be captured as one of the 120 thousand allied forces that surrendered in Singapore. He survived the war and a guy that we as a family were unbelievably proud of and will forever be indebted. The tour was a great tribute to the dilemma faced by those commanding and the conditions that they and the soldiers from across the allied force were under. Definitely recommend."
,,Bit of a walk to get to,4.0,,"We found it a bit tricky to get to with some uncertainty in how to get there from the MRT station. However, once we got there, the tour was very interesting. The only thing I was disappointed in was the lack of seating while waiting for the tour. I was somewhat unwell and being able to sit down would have been good. There were also some older people (as you would expect) who would have benefited from seating."
,,Excellent Tour,5.0,,"Did this one on my own and really enjoyed it.
Our guide, Matthew, was very informative and answered pretty much all the questions the group had and also gave us time to have a look at the posters etc. in each room.
Cost was 18 SGD and took about 1 hour 15 minutes.
If you are interested in military WW 2 history of the area then go."
,,Most informative tour,5.0,,Thoroughly enjoyed this historical tour of the bunker at Fort Canning. The cost was $18 SGD per adult and lasts roughly an hour and quarter. The bunker is behind the National Museum of Singapore.
,,WW 2 Bunker,5.0,,"It's just a WW2 bunker, the one they were in when the allies decided to surrender to the Japanese.
The tour, about 1.2 hours long, talked a great deal about the war, and what led to the final decision to surrender. It's quite well done.
If you're interested in history go for a visit. About $18 I think."
,,Easy SG history guided tour,4.0,,"The BattleBox is an easy access reminder of Singapore’s military history and an interesting, educational and air conditioned delve into the Singapore Story, only a stone’s throw from today’s tourist-magnet Clarke Quay.
Amid today’s commercial and financial frenzy, you forget that Malaya and Singapura were the British Empire’s military hub in Asia and hold important pages in the history of WW2 for the Commonwealth.

We took 11am guided tour with our two kids (7,5) and their two friends, also 7. Would definitely recommended the guided tour with kids as it keeps the information crisp and focused for the little ones over 75-90 minutes. Special highlights for the boys being the soldiers’ toilets and everything that comes with that. Older kids can probably self guide but I always recommend using the knowledge that is available from people who have actually studied this stuff rather than guessing.

The tour is a walk through the various rooms of the underground bunker, 9 meters/3 storeys down, with artefacts, maps, recreations of the decision making moments and obviously the story of what unfolded so swiftly in the Battle of Singapore in 1942. I don’t think it is wheelchair friendly, did not see any elevators.

Book tickets ahead as the BattleBox is small and underground and they obviously keep group sizes small otherwise it would get loud.

Tour guide was no nonsense, military style, kept the kids in check. They will ask noisy or uncontrolled children to leave as it is a bunker and the sound echoes. Note the dad with toddler who was asked to step out of the room several times and missed a lot of the commentary. Put a bit of a downer on the morning and made me as a parent a little more anxious of my kids’ behaviour.

But if your kids are well mannered and can listen to direction, you’ll be fine. The reception building has souvenirs, drinks and ice creams for the well-behaved ones (and for adults too)."
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,This attraction is better with a guided tour. Also take bug spray. The history is fascinating and we all left with lots to think about. There are some great books in the ticket office.
,,Singapores place for the not-so- finest-hour.,4.0,,"A very interesting place to visit, if you are interested in war history. The Battle-ax was the place for britains capitulation during WW2."
,,Great interesting little museum,5.0,,"Whilst on holiday staying near Clark Quay we went for a walk in Fort Canning Park and found this great museum.

There are a few things to do in the park and this is one I would highly recommend.

You have to book into a guided tour so pre book or get there a little before the next planned one (check their website).

The tour guide was great and really informative. The place was really interesting and don’t worry it’s nice and air conditioned now, not like it was back in WW2."
,,Well worth visiting,5.0,,"If in Singapore you need to visit this attraction.
Matthew was our guide, very informative and shared insights about the strategies of the impending invasion from Japan.
We would have liked more time to read the information in each room, perhaps allow an additional 5 minutes in the rooms that have information to read and look at before you leave it.
Chris & Karen Manning"
,,Best Historical Tour Ever,5.0,,My friend and I have just finished doing a tour of The Battlebox. Irdianty was exceptionally good at taking her vast academic knowledge of Singapore history and making it accessible and interesting for every day people. A rare skill. The museum is well done and the air conditioning most welcome! Thank you Irdianty and Battlebox for an interesting and riveting afternoon.
,,So interesting!!!,5.0,,You like history and knowing why thins are like they are? This visit is amazing! It explains everything concerning the history of Singapore! It's not expensive and you really can't miss it!
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"I read about this tour on trip advisor and it definitely did not disappoint! Our tour guide is very knowledgeable and it does gives you a very good understanding of the history of a particular moment when the British is fighting against the Japanese in WW2. Do note that the tour has specific start timings, so check out their website in advice to plan the arrival times!"
,,A place to really understand what happened,5.0,,"Excellent place to come to understand the circumstances of how WW2 was brought on to Singapore, and what happens when you underestimate your enemy. The guides are fantastic and point they deliver will fascinate you."
,,Very interesting tour even for local residents!,5.0,,I must say that this tour surpasses all my expectations and it’s conducted in such a great standard by our tour guide Nancy. The Battle of Singapore history came alive as we went through room by room and watched the amazing re-enactment of major historical scenes. I learnt a great knowledge during the 1.5 hour tour. The pace was done very well and time flies so fast! It’s air conditioned inside so don’t worry about feeling stuffy at all. Taking photos and videos inside is not allowed so here’s a photo of the entrance. This tour is so worth it so don’t miss it guys!
,,A tour not to be missed,4.0,,"For anybody interested in the period from the initial invasion of what was at the time Malay by the Japanese to the conclusion of that invasion only a matter of weeks later this tour is a must.
Our guide was one of the most enthusiastic and knowledgeable guides that I have ever come across. He was ex Singapore Army with the rank of Sergeant and his knowledge of the campaign was, as you would expect, extensive.
The command centre is extensive, consisting of some 29 rooms or thereabouts with some period equipment, numerable cameos and films taken at the time depicting the run up to events on the final day of the battle when the decision to surrender was taken.
Clearly from the British point of view it was a total shambles from beginning to end with a lack of equipment, resources and adequate prior planning the overriding factors.
This was all clearly presented and it was very much a case of 'all of us' versus the Japanese.
Leaving the tour left you with a very sad feeling that we let down not only ourselves but also all of the people of Malay and Singapore. We knew a fair bit about this period of history but learnt a great deal more on the tour.
One not to be missed."
,,A fascinating tour,5.0,,"This tour brought vividly to life the final surrender of the British to the Japanese on the 15th February 1942.
Living in the UK we are aware of the conflict in Europe but not very knowledgeable regarding the fall of Malaya and Singapore.
Our two young guides were able to explain how the situation developed and what life was like in the underground command centre in an accessible and interesting way. They had an in-depth knowledge of the subject and despite being assessed by their more senior colleagues spoke clearly and confidently.
The underground bunker has some confined spaces so it is recommended to book a tour in advance.
Allow time to explore the Fort Canning Park which is a haven of tranquillity in a very busy city."
,,Turned my understanding of the surrender of Singapore on its head.,5.0,,"A fantastic tour.
Very well informed, articulate guide. A huge amount of fascinating detail, leaving a completely different perspective of Percival.
The tour provided a mass of fascinating information, and brought to life the terrible position the army leaders were left in, with no air cover or sea power.
The tour itself takes about an hour and a half - and if there are items you missed, ask at the end of the tour. S$18 and two hours really well spent. If you only have a short time in Singapore, this must be at the top of your list. Be sure and book. There won't be any photos of this trip - you aren't allowed to take any."
,,"BATTLE BOX, FORT CANNING",5.0,,"Very, very interesting tour with an extremely well-informed guide. Not much that can't be learned about the build up to and final invasion of Singapore."
,,Loved this tour,5.0,,"The tour was very informative and our guide, Matt, is basically the nicest person we've met in Singapore. Went with my 15 and 9 year old sons who thought it was interesting. We recommend this tour and visiting the grounds."
,,How You Learn The history of WWII in Singapore,5.0,,"The guide helped us to learn every single corner of the Battlebox. Well-maintained, felt like it brought me back to that time period."
,,Takes you back to WWII,5.0,,"Guided tour of old underground fort. Takes about 60 minutes. Gives you feel for last days of WWII surrender. Must do for any history or military buff.

Space is a bit damp but cool after a hot walk to the top of Fort Canning. The tour is limited so check times and arrive a little early to get a spot."
,,Great attraction - must visit,5.0,,Walked up to the top of Fort Canning and discovered the Battlebox. Tours must be with a guide. It was a educational interesting tour at a pleasant temperature. Really is a must for any trip to Singapore.
,,Very informative and interesting to see it in person,5.0,,"We did the Singapore Battlebox and Fort Canning Hill Tour. Shar was awesome. He was also out tour guide on a tour a few days later and even remembered our names and faces. It is very eye opening to see the battlebox area where they actually were! It was a great overview of what actually happened at that time. A great mix of Shar talking us through things, visually seeing it and also watching some short videos. Thank you!"
,,So interesting...and so sad,5.0,,"You can only see this by guided tour - so some forward planning is advised. However, it is well worth it. The guides are really good and make the whole place come alive with the history of the last days of the British garrison in Singapore. It's harrowing to think of the decisions the commanders had to make balancing the need to defend the island with the highly unlikely chance of reinforcement and the desire to minimise civilian casualties."
,,A good way to get the WW2 story of Singapore,5.0,,"Battlebox is the underground bunker system used by British and allied command during the Japanese attack on Singapore. Guided tours are offered at set times (we went at 1100; the one before was at 0945) so check first. The Guide gave a polished performance and answered questions about Britain's greatest defeat. In fact, I thought that the coverage was quite well balanced. Most of the main rooms are visited and two are set up for short videos. The tour took 75 minutes, but it felt quicker due to way we moved from room to room with short messages in each and various model setups and poster material to read. Everyone on the tour seemed to enjoy it. The bunker is in a lovely park ideal for a stroll."
,,Informative tour of the last stronghold that the British held before surrender in 1942,4.0,,What might have been a rather dull tour of rooms largely stripped of their original fittings and fixtures is enlivened by a well informed narrative of the factors that led ultimately to the British surrender.
,,Surreal,3.0,,"Took the tour knowing quite a bit beforehand about our disaster during the war, but this was still informative."
,,Great experience for the family,5.0,,"My family of 5 (2 adults and 3 children aged 6, 10 and 12) all thoroughly enjoyed this tour. Walking through the underground bunker system and hearing about the defense of Singapore and the final surrender was very interesting. Our guide was very knowledgeable and shared so much detail with us. I wondered whether my 6 year old would enjoy it but she was attentive the entire time. The tour is broken up with some movie clips, walking and then talking by the tour guide."
,,Fantastic piece of history,5.0,,"Really informative and interesting. The guide, Kamaliah, was excellent. A part of history that I knew very little about."
,,Great history lesson!,5.0,,"As a WWII history buff I absolutely loved this tour. However, my wife and children (8 and 10 years old) also raved over how wonderful it was. Irdianty (our guide) did an INCREDIBLE job of telling the Battlebox story while tying it in to the larger WWII picture. My children were enthralled the whole time. One of the best things to do in Singapore even if not a military buff (make reservations and ask for Irdianty)."
,,Fascinating and informative,5.0,,Very informative tour with a great guide. The tour is about 1.5 hours long but the time flew by. The information is clearly presented and as well as a very knowledgable guide the building itself is interesting and contains many interesting exhibits and short films. I learnt a great deal about the second world war in Singapore and the British surrender to the Japanese. Fascinating tour - highly recommended if you like history.
,,Battlebox a must see,5.0,,"Located in Fort Canning Hill this extraordinary attraction is as much about the history of Singapore as it is about its role in WWII and the defence/fall of Singapore. Its a well run, informative tour with very knowledgeable tour guides and good use of AV materials to tell this remarkable story. They also remain very respectful of those who fought and sacrificed during those very dark days. Well worth a look. Lest we forget."
,,Battle box Fort Canning,4.0,,"Nice piece of Second World War history of Singapore and Far East ! Well maintained , guide, Wws well informed . Underground fortified construction well planned . The guide also explained how the British and Australian forces were forced to surrender due to lack of resources and superior / surprise strategy of the Japanese forces ."
,,amazing historical site,5.0,,a must visit to get an understanding of the British capitulation to the Japanese invasion found it interesting that it was linked to the attack at pearl harbour.
,,Very Informative Tour Guide,5.0,,"I love this place, once I visited the battlebox and joined the tour lead by a tour guide named Sharul. This man surely knows what he is telling, he has passion and knowledge, kind of tour guide that I respect. Too bad making photo are not allowed"
,,History lesson not widely known,4.0,,"Learnt a lot about the fall of Singapore. Good history information. Well worth the trudge up the hill to the booking office, but make sure you book and then wait for the tour."
,,What have they done?,3.0,,"Have visited Battlebox before for a 5* visit - last time the ex-military tour guide was engaged and informative. This time I thought going on the longer tour would highlight an interest in military history, but were treated to a pleasant-enough young woman who appeared to be reading the spiel with no interest in military history. There were posters, maps and a cabinet of military artefacts from an archaeological dig at Bukit Timah - all of which I would have liked time to peruse, but we were whistled past. In summary, I'm looking for something with a bit more substance, please."
,,Very informative visit,5.0,,"I went on Sunday 11th March 2018 and thoroughly enjoyed the tour. The Docent was very well imformed and pitched the tour at exactly the right level, neither patronising nor academic. The exhibits were static but the surroundings were impressive and added to the atmosphere. There was a good balance between the guide and historical film footage. My one criticism is that there was not enough time to read some of the exhibits.
Would recommend booking ahead."
,,Disappointing Customer Service,1.0,,"I intended to visit today and booked via TripAdvisor, but inadvertently I had booked for the 1.30 tour tomorrow. I couldn’t make a later tour today. The customer service was very disappointing- the staff at the exhibition couldn’t/wouldn’t accommodate a genuine mistake. One extra person would have had little impact on logistics/safety. What happened to reasonable treatment of customers?"
,,Interesting tour with great guide,4.0,,"Had never heard of Battlebox before so was not sure what to expect. Venue easy enough to get to from train station. Our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and friendly and this enhanced the tour experience. Very large area downstairs, bigger than we expected, but very interesting with some short videos and written information on the events of the war and what happened in the Battlebox. Would recommend a visit."
,,"OF GRAVES, GUNS & BATTLES - worth every minute and dollar!",5.0,,We did this tour after we were bored of eating and shopping all the time (wich is still great in SG). Gripping Story told by an outstanding guide named sharul! Wish my history teachers were half as captivating...I can only recommend it!
,,Interesting tour about the Japanese occupation of Singapore,5.0,,"In Europe you just get some informations about WWII in Europe itself and perhaps Pearl Harbor. The conflict in Asia isn't that popular. So I got many new informations about the Japanese occupation of Singapore. So it was totally worth it.
Pay attention it's just possible to enter the museum with a tour. So come early enough to get your ticket because it can be busy."
,,Battle box- excellent tour.,5.0,,An engaging and informative visit. Very well presented tour that discussed the key points around the fall of Singapore. Go on this tour and learn about the most dramatic surrender in modern warfare.
,,Best Experience in Singapore,5.0,,"Wow, what a tour. We were given a fantastic guided tour through this historically important site. The guide was extremely knowledgeable and spoke extremely well about the site. It was informative and interesting. The wax models of the British Officers are quite amazing and the whole site is set up as a wonderful memory of Singapore in wartime."
,,Interesting History Tour,4.0,,I went on this guided History tour in the bunker. It was interesting and informative. If you don’t like confined spaces this tour is not for you. Very easy to follow as there was scenes in different rooms and plenty of relics of the time to look at. Well worth the visit.Must wear walking
,,Learning History,4.0,,"I'm not much for history tours but this was on my husband's to do list whilst in Singapore. I actually found this tour interesting, and by having displays recreating the events and the people as they looked then made it ever better. The guide we had on our tour was excellent. I wish I could remember her name."
,,Excellent Explanation of the Fall of Singapore,5.0,,"If you are interested in the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in WW II, do take the Battlebox Tour. This 75 minute guided tour gives a detailed account of the Japanese campaign through Malaya, the British defense strategy and why Singapore fell.
Well worth doing if you are interested in WW II in Asia."
,,Good bit of history,5.0,,Visited here while I had a few days off on a business trip. Been to Singapore a few times and slowly ticking off all the tourist attractions. Wish I’d done this tour sooner as it was fantastic and very eye opening to see all the history about the place. Very professional tour. Highly recommend.
,,Must Do!,5.0,,"Don’t miss an opportunity to do this tour. A fabulous insight into the fall of Singapore. Walk through the network of underground rooms, and listen to the very knowledgeable guides talking you through the series of events that led to the surrender of the British forces. Not just for those interested in war history.... I discovered a wealth of information I never knew."
,,Can't rate this enough,5.0,,"Very interesting place. Tour guide was knowledgeable, friendly and kind. Highly recommend as part of your Singapore experiences."
,,Outstanding...,5.0,,"Up there with the best WW2 tours I have done, including the War Rooms Tour in London. This tour is a fantastic insight (overview) of the pre- and -war times of Singapore. I have a strong interest in WW2 and today I learnt a lot about why in the end Singapore had to fall. It was interesting to hear about the thinking behind the decision from Percival and his command. The young lady who lead the tour was passionate and very eager to answer any of our questions. She also pointed out some facts about the eventual surrender of the Japanese that I had never heard or read before...go on the tour to find them out.

I highly recommend this tour for anyone with an interest in Singapore’s past."
,,Actual fortifications from World War 2,4.0,,"The Battlebox is accessible only by guided tour. Tickets are not available online. Everyone meets at the ticket office which is also a small souvenir shop. The fortifications are original. There might have been some extra ventilation added to allow the tours. The facility is not completely open to the public, but enough of it is to be worthwhile. There are several well done mannequins (wax figures?) here and there throughout. The highpoint is the meeting room where the British made the decision to surrender. There is a life size diorama of the event here with wax figures that resemble the actual participants. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and pleasant. Most artifacts were brought in for the exhibit and are not from this facility. The tour includes three short films about the battle for Singapore; one at the beginning of the tour, one in the middle of the tour and the last at the end. The tour itself is over one hour."
,,Insightful.,5.0,,"A view to the city's past in 1941-1942. In a way, it's like the tunnels at Corregidor in the Philippines. You may want to plan time to take in the Former Ford Factory as well."
,,Excellent and informative tour,5.0,,Definitely one of the top five attractions to visit in Singapore where one learns about the darkest day in British military history and the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in WWII. The Battlebox was the British underground command center. This is by guided tour only; buy timed entry tickets from the visitor center which is around the corner (a short walk down the hill) from the Battlebox entrance. The informative tour lasts about 1h 15m.
,,Cool historical place,5.0,,I recommend visiting this bunker if you would want to know more about how the Japanese beat the UK during the world war. The place itself is still like the old times. Goosebumps..
,,Great for history-lovers,5.0,,"If you are interested in history-especially World War 2 history, then this tour is a must. Visit to the underground British WW 2 HQ is by guided tour only. Make sure you get to the visitor centre in plenty of time to buy your tickets as tours fill up. If you have time to spend before your tour, you can walk around the park enjoying the views and watching the birds and animals. You can also visit a replica of Raffles house which is in the park. We spent just over an hour walking around the park, but if you have more time, you could spend it in the National museum which is situated just next to the park. The tours start and end in the shop and ours lasted an hour and 30 minutes. The guide was very informative and showed a couple of videos as we went on this fascinating tour. The shop has many books about Singapore available to purchase."
,,"Great tour, unique activity in Singapore",5.0,,"We really enjoyed learning about Singapore's history in WW2. The Battlebox was very different from the other activities that are popular for tourist in Singapore, so we really appreciated the uniqueness, and elevated our visit to this country. The guide was excellent and knowledgeable, and told the story well. Great way to spend 1.5 hours."
,,"Fabulous Tour of the Allied Command Post, the Battlebox",5.0,,"Great explanation of the reasons for the fall of the British and Australian troops and the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese in WWII. Many mistakes by the British in the UK stranded the British and Australian troops without any sea or air power against a heavily armored, rapidly advancing Japanese army. Be sure to book or buy your tickets early because the tours sell out. We were at the ticket office before 1:30pm but the 1:30pm tour was sold out. We bought tickets for the 2:45pm tour and walked the Fort Canning grounds for an hour. When we returned for our tour it was also sold out so there were some disappointed people waiting for the next tour. We loved the information presented."
,,Good tour on the surrender. Great job by the guide,5.0,,"Good visit to the underground command center of the british/australian/indian troops during the japanese invasion to Malaysia and Singapore. History well told, with details and a number of illustrative videos. Worthwhile the time and the price of the ticket. Great job by the lady that served as guide, one can see she enjoys telling the stories."
,,Join the tour to be in awe!,5.0,,"I am a huge fan of the World War 2 stories. Before visiting The Battlebox, I watched The Darkest Hour, a movie when Churchill had an underground command centre during the WW2 and visiting The Battlebox (and joining the tour) made my imagination come to life. The guide was insightful and fun at the same time explaining events that took place in The Battlebox and changed the history of Singapore when the British had to surrender to the Japanese. The tour included watching short movies that made the experience even better. Come early because the tour is so popular. They had to reject some latecomers to keep the tour convenient and safe."
,,Good tour,4.0,,"I enjoyed the tour, which was well put together and brought the history to life. A couple of tips. It's worth double checking the website before you go. I turned up to do the early tour only to discover a notice pinned to the door saying that two of the scheduled tours on that day (including the one I had turned up for) were not taking place. To be fair, they had posted this information on their website and Facebook page, but I hadn't realised this. When I went later on to do one of the afternoon tours, I noticed that they filled up quite quickly and several people who had turned up wanting to do the next tour were told that the tour was full and they would have to do a later one. So perhaps best to arrive a little while in advance and spend the spare time you'll have waiting for the tour to start by exploring some of the rest of the park."
,,Interesting tour,4.0,,A friend suggested we visit this attraction whilst in Singapore and we found this tour both interesting and informative. It was a highlight of our Singapore visit. It was bit of a walk from Dhoby Ghaut MRT and we were the last to join the next tour.It was the underground HQ before the fall of Singapore and there were about 500 men in the bunkers ( with 6 toilets). We were glad we visited and thanked our friend for their suggestion.
,,Surrender of Singapore,5.0,,Very interesting and informative tour. The underground structure is airconditioned so ideal for a break from the hot outside temperatures. Tour by guide only.
,,Get to know more about a place you visit,5.0,,"A nicely organized tour with an engaging guide. The setting is quite unique and it makes the tour more intriguing as you walk through a piece of Singapore's history.

There is nothing flashy here, no sparks, no dazzle, and no robots. So it's amazing how hooked I was with the storytelling of the Battlebox and the fall of Singapore during WWII.

Out of nowhere, our packed group spontaneously applauded the guide at the end of the tour."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Pretty interesting however a little pricy ($18.....but it is in Singapore so maybe that’s actually not that expensive), you can only enter with a tour, so make sure you arrive at one of the set times or else you will find yourself waiting around for a while."
,,Well Worth A Visit,5.0,,If you want to know about the Fall of Singapore in 1942 this is an excellent place to visit. All tours are guided and informative. The Battlebox is situated in Fort Canning Park with its beautifully laid out gardens and walks.
,,Excellent tour,5.0,,"My husband and I did this tour, and it was a lot more than we expected, informative guide, terrific display and insightful information on the history of war in Singapore. A definite must of a tour. The only negative was as our tour was ending another tour started, and the competition of the two guides voices was off putting. Maybe they should wait until one is completed as the area is not that big and echos."
,,A Must see!,5.0,,"I didn’t know what to expect from this tour, but our guide Jerome was incredible! So interesting with lots of information to share about the surrender of Singapore! A great insight into tactics and events during ww2!"
,,Recommend,5.0,,"For most Brits the story of what happened in Singapore during WW2 is a bit of a mystery. Do this visit. Fascinating.

It is a guided tour which lasts about 75 mins. It is very well done and the story as it unfolded is told very well. The added bonus on a hot sultry day in Singapore is that the entire tour takes place in the bunker itself underground and it is nice and cool.

Check ahead for your times.

Top tip - the Canning Park Hotel is 100m from the tour start and finish. This is a good spot to drop in for a cold drink before and/or after the tour."
,,Interesting and historic,4.0,,We weren’t sure what to expect but thoroughly enjoyed the Battlebox. Very interesting and well informed guide. Well worth a visit.
,,Interesting History,4.0,,The Battlebox tour was very interesting and our guide did an excellent job of explaining everything and showing us around. Might not be the best for young children as they might get bored.
,,Enjoyable and informative,5.0,,A mix of spoken `tutorial` and video make for a good experience. I would have liked a bit more time to walk round on my own to study the exhibits as there is so much to see
,,Good overview,5.0,,"Went to a guided tour of the battlebox and spent an interesting hour. A good combination of walk-through, documentary movie clips and exhibits to look at. After the battlebox we moved on to the National Museum, another worthwile stop."
,,Excellent historical site in Singapore - Battlebox; book and do the tour - a must!,5.0,,"Battlebox tour in Fort Canning Park - excellent. You have to be booked on a tour to get access to the underground offices and tunnels that make up the Battlebox - but there are plenty and it's not overly expensive.
Was really interesting to see from where the British forces in Singapore were managed...Very interesting to see the rooms where such difficult decisions were made that culminated in the British surrender to the Japanese during WWII.
The young lady that led our tour - well informed, knew her stuff and led us around. A mix of short films, wall exhibits, artefacts and the guide's stories - a great tour to do in Singapore. Cool underground too... a welcome break from the heat and humidity above ground."
,,Excellent informative tour,5.0,,"Would highly recommend this tour. My husband and I originally from the uk and having lived in Australia now for fifteen years were ignorant of how WW2 played out here until we did this tour and it was quite an eye opener . My twin daughters aged eleven also highly enjoyed not it , tour is very informative and as a result we then took a trip to fort silso on Sentosa the next day to discover more of the history of this island . Since returning from our holiday my husband has started reading extensively on the history of Singapore and the Second World War all sparked by this excellent tour"
,,Fascinating exploration of a little known place in Singapore,5.0,,"A fascinating tour of the underground bunker complex used by the British and their allies in the Battle for Singapore and the surrender to the Japanese. Well worth the visit. Our guide had a nice style in conveying detailed information about the operation of the bunkers and the surrender. My only criticism is that despite what the website says about not needing to book a tour, I recommend that you book. We arrived in plenty of time for our chosen tour but it was already full. The same thing happened to people arriving for the next tour after us."
,,"Of Graves, Guns & Battles",5.0,,"Well worth the time.
A very informative/educational tour given by an excellent professional & compassionate tour guide called Shar who was also friendly and enthusiastic in his approach, he is an asset to the team.
I would advise anyone visiting Singapore to visit this as it give’s a good insight into the country’s history."
,,Great trip for history buffs and non history buffs alike,5.0,,"We had a very enjoyable tour of the Battlebox. Our guide was very knowledgable, pleasant and enthusiastic. In fact she shared what seems to be the national appetite for the history of Singapore which is great.
The actual site reeks of history and is well supported by good film clips and information boards.
The only negative I’d bring out, is that prior to arriving at the museum itself, we tried to book on line and the website didn’t allow this, nor did it make very clear that you could only acquire tickets at the office and that you could only gain entrance as part of a guided tour. None of that detracted from a very well run tour that we enjoyed."
,,Great tour with a great guide,5.0,,This tour really brought to life the predicament of the defenders and the reasons for the decisions they made. A must-do for anyone interested in this story.
,,History buff must see.,5.0,,"No photos inside are allowed. About 2.5 hours. Two movies about 10 minutes each . Tour guide gives details of war, both surrenders. Very interesting. Worth visiting. Air conditioned."
,,Second visit and better this time,5.0,,"Eight years since last visit, and I feel the story was better told this time. The guide Dami(sorry? 1445 5/2) was engaging, enthusiastic and knew her stuff.. the story I feel was fairly told, but maybe a little bit more on the story of occupation would round it off nicely...."
,,fascinating tour,5.0,,Located in the beautiful and fascinating fort canning park is this great recreation of the singapore war theatre in WW2. The tour is a must
,,Excellent visit,5.0,,"We had a really interesting guided tour, tour guide was spot on and knew his history, very informative and as its got A/C good to do if it's hot. Mind you a bit difficult to fine as the signs must be covered up at moment by the road works close to MRT station."
,,How to not tell history,2.0,,"I'm sincerely a friend of history and do like to take a look into the past, but this place is dreadful. The story is poorly explained and the figures looks very bad. I just give a higher rating, because the story itself is interesting of this place. Hence, the place has an atmosphere, but nothing I would immediately recommend."
,,An insight into the fall of Singapore WW2,5.0,,This was a short four worth going on. You actually can't go in any other way and the information is fascinating.
,,Historic and worth the visit,5.0,,"Probably the most historic landmark in Singapore. The Royal Palace of Malay once stood on this hill, then the residence of many British governors once Singapore became a British territory.

The hill was converted into a fort in 1860 and renamed Fort Canning in honour of Viscount Charles John Canning, Governor-General and first Vicerory of India. Around 1920s–1930s, the hill was transformed into an artillery fort with barracks, officers’ quarters, old gunpowder magazine and a hospital. An underground bunker called the Battle Box was also constructed during this time.

Key historic events also took place on Fort Canning Hill. Most notably, Lt-General Percival’s crucial decision to surrender to the Japanese was made in the Battle Box at Fort Canning Hill."
,,Important Chapter in Singapore's History,5.0,,"I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but ended up being very pleased that I included this site on my itinerary. The guide was knowledgeable, spoke good English, and was high energy in narrating the tour. You'll get a bit of strategy on both sides leading up to this tragic surrender during WWII. I received good directions from the Conrad Hotel staff and visited the site via the MRT. It's a bit of a stair walk up to the site, so less mobile visitors should consider a taxi. Highly recommended for history buffs!"
,,"Fort Siloso, Sentosa Island Singapore",5.0,,"This historical area (including artillery, pill boxes, cannon, monuments, and recreations) is a refreshing gem on an otherwise tourist island. Take the cable car to the Siloso Skywalk and then to the fort. Very detailed and informative descriptions give you a true feel for Singapore's experience in World War II and its military history well before then. Loved it."
,,Definately worth a visit,5.0,,This was a very informative look at the surrender of Singapore and the aftermath. Suitable for teenagers and those not usually into military history.
,,Excellent atmospheric guided tour,5.0,,"Great combination of atmosphere and well informed, enthusiastic guide ensured the Battlebox is a great way to access a critical moment in WW2 and Singapore history."
,,Visit to Battlebox,5.0,,"Excellent and educational history tour of events when Singapore fell to the Japanese. We enjoyed the whole tour. We are sorry that this historical event is not taught in schools today.
Tour is well run and guide excellent. Well worth the visit and the cost of tour"
,,Excellent overview of Singapore's history in a historic bunker,5.0,,"Excellent visit. Well organised and the tour was led by the very knowledgeable and enthusiatic guide named Aysha. She shared fascinating insights and was knowledgeable about the bunker, it's history and origins. Expect a 1 hour plus tour of an underground bunker. Not scary at all! Well lit, air-conditioned comfort and very interesting. Expect to see well made wax figurines and layouts that depict scenes from the past. Definitely recommend for anyone who might want a glimpse of Singapore's history in a nutshell. Expect uneven steps, standing and walking. Would not recommend for immobile persons but otherwise content is suitable for all ages. Pictures, audio or video is not allowed, so taking pics off the net for your reference."
,,Riveting Overview of the Fall of Singapore,5.0,,"We visited this with our two children, 6,9 and it was fantastic! You are taken into the bunkers below Fort Canning where the British made the fateful decision to fall to the Japanese. The bunkers are also a very cool reprieve from the Singapore heat and humidity. They have posters/artefacts and mannequins to show where events happened and what transpired during that time. Our guide, Jerome's humour and passionate explanations brought the terrible events of those weeks to life. My 9 year old was fascinated (the 6 y.o daughter a bit less so, but then again she was tired after climbing up Fort Canning!) but us adults had a wonderful and very enlightened time learning about these events. I must say, I am no history buff and not really interested in politics, but Jerome inspired me to learn more about World War II! Definitely a highlight during our visit to Singapore."
,,Absolutely a MUST when visiting Singapore,5.0,,Just experienced the Battlebox tour in Fort Canning. The guided tour was highly engaging and informative. It was truly fascinating to see the actual space (complete with graffiti on the walls) where the British army headquarters was and to hear a very clear account of the events leading up to the fall of Singapore. Visitors and locals alike should all experience this significant piece of local history.
,,Interesting tour,5.0,,"My family and I (including an 11 and 13 year old) recently went on the Battlebox tour. We all enjoyed it. Our guide Aisha was very knowledgeable and engaging. It was a great way to find out about the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese, as well as some general history of the country. A number of short videos during the tour were well put together and provided a good change of pace. Highly recommended if you have a couple of hours to spare. I would suggest going by taxi if you are not overly mobile as there are quite a few flights of stairs if walking from the Dhoby Ghaut station."
,,Bringing history to life,5.0,,"The Battlebox tour is a must for anyone with an interest in history and WWII. The guided tour was excellent, the guide bringing to life the events that led up to the surrender in 1942. Walking through the underground tunnels, seeing the conditions in which people lived and worked, hearing and seeing the events unfold made this a truly unforgettable experience and one NOT to be missed."
,,Battlebox visit,4.0,,"Excellent piece of WWII history - well maintained and artifacts sufficient to give some idea of actual conditions (not the extreme anguish of being at war, but an idea of the physical condition). Guide was very knowledgeable and answered all questions with a good amount of detail. Very well worth the treck up the hill to visit and learn more about Singapore during the 1940s at war."
,,War historians will love it,5.0,,What an absolutely amazing place to visit. I had no idea of the conditions our service people worked under until the fall of Singapore. The re-creations here are astounding. Hot and humid but with the help of a guide an absolute must do.
,,Enthusiastic guide,4.0,,"The guide was great, enthusiastic and gave plenty of good information. Learnt some things that I thought was fact about the Battle of Singapore but was actually a myth! Would have wished for a little free time to explore the whole thing by myself at the end, but I do realise the safety concerns with that. My girlfriend was also extremely pleased with the visit, quoting that she loved the amount of interesting facts about the history of the place, in fact she was more pleased than me!"
,,History Lovers ..,5.0,,A must for history lovers .. Though not much of a history fan but enjoyed it thoroughly .. It is during the British Era and again a well maintained tourist destination .. Do Visit
,,Very informative tour,5.0,,A great 1 hour + tour of this underground bunker. Our guide was super and made the tour very interesting A great way to find out about Singapore during the Second World War Excellent value for money
,,A must for WWII and British Empire History fans,5.0,,"When you step into the Battlebox, you step into the past. In its climate controlled rooms, you are taken on an excellent, step-by-step tour not only of the physical location of Malaya Command during the last few weeks of battle, but also the diary of the events leading up to the loss of Singapore. You gain a new appreciation of what was going through the minds of the men in charge. Be sure to listen carefully to the clue to the bonus question!"
,,Great historical experience (get a small group),5.0,,"I know my history, and this is a great insight into what would have been happening in Singapore at an important time. It was refreshing to have a guide at such an activity who clearly knew more than the 'tour standard' and who was willing to share her views on views on what people may have been thinking at the time. Unfortunately, our group was too big, so I suggest people do an early, not midday tour, as it looked like the one before us only had three people! Very well preserved and tastefully augmented with period items. Al at 'leavetoroam.com'."
,,A must see if you love WWII history,5.0,,"I did the tour that was supposed to be 1:15 minutes, it actually was quite a bit longer which was great! You get a lot of historical background and the guide was a bit dramatic about it so if you have studied the history of Singapore in WWII it might be redundant, but being there in person was really amazing. The surrender conference was suprizingly well done, I liked the fidelity of the depiction of the conference. Breathing history, absolutely worth the time. The park is very nice too."
,,Great visit,5.0,,"The WW2 history has a niche here. Lots of unknown details were presented to us during the tour. Our guide was a very young lady who was very well prepared and knew a lot about what really happened here when the japanese invaded Malaya and Singapore.
It’s worth visiting the Battlebox!"
,,Highly Recommended Guided Tour on Singapore History,5.0,,"The 1.5 hour guided tour on the WWII history of Singapore is definitely value for your money. Kamaliah was our informative and enthusiastic guide and she took us to various rooms in the bunker that indeed once acted as an operations centre back in the day. The entire flow of the tour was smooth with the stories of Singapore portrayed very clearly through mixed media - videos, life-sized mannequins, actual remnants of equipment, and many more.

Tip: When you visit the toilets, be sure to look for the airplane graffiti in one of the stalls that was actually drawn by a soldier. Well preserved and takes you back in time."
,,Great tour,5.0,,We visited the Battlebox mainly because my husband is very interested in war history but I also enjoyed this tour very much. It gave a wonderful insight into the fall of Singapore and it’s place in history. The tour takes about 1 1/2 hours and us very comprehensive and interesting. Our young tour guide was well researched and enthusiastic about sharing the story. Definitely worth the $18 entry fee.
,,Guided Tour was Limited,3.0,,"Loved the history and the tour guide news. The bunker took me back to what it must have been like for the British and how they must have struggled with the decision to give up Singapore. The guide was very knowledgeable. The life size figures were very believable and lifelike. There were posters of information inside the bunker and many pictures with descriptions. As this was a guided tour and the tour guide didn't seem to feel the need to take much time to let us read the information it was a let down there. You cannot go in by yourself so we couldn't go back in to read. I felt like I didn't get my money's worth,"
,,"Slightly macabre, definitely sad underground former military. building",5.0,,"Modern history reviewed, and open to the public. Situated at the top of the Fort Canning Park, this underground bunker acted as the command centre for the combined British Empire forces in WW2. It was also where the decisions leading to the surrender to the invading Japanese army cutting across the Malay peninsular were made.
The bunker, which has been made safe to visit, but otherwise it is much as it was on the fateful day, when General Percival surrendered.
Slightly macabre, definitely sad underground former military. building"
,,much improved tours from the past,5.0,,Our tour guide Dianne was was very knowledgeable and could answer every questions that the group asked. The tour takes between an hour and hour and a half depending on group size. The much improved air conditioning system make the tour very pleasant and i learnt a LOT more this tour about the war and would visit again.
,,Excellent way to spend an hour,5.0,,"This was a must see attraction in my opinion. The experience was educational and fascinating, well delivered and resonably priced. Kids would love this every bit as much as the adults."
,,Interesting and Moving,5.0,,"A very interesting account of the fall of Singapore during World War 2. Our guide Mel gave a moving, engaging and at times even humorous account of the circumstances that led to the fall of Singapore in 1945. My partner was not particularly interested in the history of Singapore, but found the tour engaging and interesting! A must do in Singapore!"
,,Very interesting tour!,5.0,,"This is a very good historical tour with lot of information provided by the guide. Our guide, Ayesha, was excellent and kept us engaged throughout the tour."
,,Great tour,5.0,,"Me and my daughter took my husband here after spending serval days shopping ( not his favourite thing ) and we all enjoyed it. When we arrived it said the tour was fully booked but they did let us join it, think it is best to pre book. The tour was 1 1/2 hour long in the bunker telling the story of the last few days before Singapore fell to the Japanese in world war 2 , if you love history you will love this , it’s in Fort Canning Park , which is nice to walk through with a cafe , 5 minutes from the new Fort Canning MRT station"
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"We experienced this attraction whilst in Singapore for several days.
The Attraction is centred around the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in World War Two.
In fact it consists of viewing the underground bunker where all the important decisions were made. As so, it takes in all the various strategies and plans which resulted in the eventual surrender of the country.
You have to take a conducted tour with a guide who explains all of the important decisions which led to the downfall of the country and which eventually dictated the future of Singapore.
The tour was fascinating but possibly a little expensive as it cost us thirty six Singapore dollars (about twenty five pounds) for just over an hour.
Overall, I would say it is well worth experiencing this Trip whilst in Singapore.
Having said that, I found it frustrating that having paid out for the attraction you were not allowed to take photographs in order to relive the experience back home."
,,Fantastic look back at history,5.0,,"The Battlebox Tour takes visitors into the heart of the bunker where the ultimate decision to surrender to the Japanese was made during the war. It is a guided tour only and that is what makes it a unique experience. Our guide was amazing, full of knowledge about the battle of Singapore. Unfortunately you are not able to take pictures, but this does not detract from the experience. Highly recommend."
,,2 ladies with a calipers,5.0,,"This is fabulous yet sombre experience and so well done. Shar our tour guide was passionate and informative on the fall and surrender of Singapore. There is 13 steps to go down and an added bonus for us was the availability of a wheelchair. Being with an elderly mother who has difficulty in walking, Singaporeans in general are attentive, and like here, at the Battle box a wheel chair was available. The tour was brilliant and everybody should go. Fort Canning Arts Centre is a beautiful building and surroundings. Much better to have a tour guide than an audio journey more personal and involved feeling."
,,Battlebox Fort Canning Park,5.0,,"great insight into last days of The Fall of Singapore and surrender, approx 1 1/2hrs guided tour off old bunker system."
,,History,5.0,,"Put this on the list , interesting, informative and a moving account of what happened in the time leading up to Singapore’s surrendering 👍"
,,Excellent tour,4.0,,"A must visit site if only to understand the failings of the allied planning. Our tour guide was excellent and informative.

There are many displays which you may want to come back to see after the tour, just ask the guide. No photography inside the Battlebox.

The surrounding hilltop is a pleasant park if you want to get away from the nearby Orchard Rd."
,,So glad I convinced my family to join me in a tour of The Battlebox during our recent trip to Singapore.,5.0,,"We arrived just as the tour was commencing so we missed the guides initial introduction in the gift shop but caught up with the group at the entrance to the bunker.
Without the extremely informed guide (a former Sergeant in the Singapore defence force) this tour would have just been a visit to some World War 2 bunkers.
I take my hat off to you sir, you brought history to life and managed to keep my wife and daughter, both of whom have no interest in the second world war, captivated throughout the tour. They admitted to me after the tour ended that they found it far more interesting that they had expected.
I’m glad we had a tour guide and not the yet to be rolled out self-tour. Perhaps the museum should rethink their plans and offer both guided and self-tours.
I would have liked to spend more time viewing the exhibits after the tour ended but I don’t feel I missed anything.

Anybody visiting Singapore should add this tour to your must see and do list. It is quite close to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station and the Orchard Road shopping strip."
,,Battlebox Tour,5.0,,"The Battlebox Tour (1hr 15 mins) that my family and I did on 17 December with Jerome as the tour guide was fantastic and informative. Jerome new a lot about the history and was very knowledgable, friendly and had a sense of humour. We would highly recommend this tour. No photography allowed whilst on the tour."
,,Well worth visiting,5.0,,"We called in on our first day in Singapore with the intention of visiting, however we were in between tour times as we hadn't realised that you had to book and could only visit as part of a guided tour. We returned the following day, booked our place and then had the most interesting tour. We realised that if we'd wandered around on our own we wouldn't have fully understood the importance of this Battlebox or what happened in the Pacific war during WW2.
No photographs allowed inside.
Very interesting place.
Highly recommend as part of your Singapore experiences."
,,Amazing!! Don't miss this gem!,5.0,,"Fabulous experience - lots of history really well presented. Tour guide was knowledgable, friendly and kind. Cannot rate this highly enough"
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"Cannot recommend this highly enough. Complements and reinforces what you learned at Changi Museum. Jerome, the young guide was first class. Tour was highly informative and included good archive film and insight into the personalities who presided over the disaster that was the defence of Singapore. Jerome was patient and answered all questions fully and without any prejudice. Experience enhanced by fact that one member of our party was an Australian who had been evacuated from Singapore at the age of 6, at the time of the invasion. Well worth the $18. Don't miss it."
,,British Incompetency,5.0,,"The walk through the labyrinth of the underground command bunker at Fort Canning Park is a fascinating experience enhanced by the photos and other artefacts within the complex. One can only try and imagine the oppressive heat and stale air in the rooms and winding passageways and also the noise of telephones and telegraphic machines as people frantically went about the business of trying to direct the defence of Singapore.

The room where the various commanders met with General Percival to discuss the demand from the Japanese to surrender is quite poignant. The life like figures clearly show the stress and torment etched in their faces as they discussed the inevitable and the consequent ignominious surrender to the Japanese. Britain's worst humiliation in the Second World War.

Winston Churchill did not provided the Singapore garrison with the military equipment they needed and General Percival was the scapegoat for Britain's blunder."
,,Battlebox tour - Singapore,5.0,,"Fascinating and well laid out presentation of this interesting and devastating period of history, While the mannequins and staging might be hokey to some, to be in the very bunker where all this took place 0 surrounded by the same walls and artifacts, was amazing. Great great great"
,,"Battle box, Singapore",5.0,,"Spent a very informative afternoon on a guided tour of e WW11 command centre, where the British surrendered Singapore to the Japanese in1945. Ayesha, the tour guide was very knowledgable. It was well worth a visit."
,,Only for history buffs,3.0,,"I would only go on this tour if you have a keen interest in history and WW2. Otherwise, quite boring."
,,Interesting visit,5.0,,"This museum was right up my street. I love military history and especially British history. The guide was very knowledgable and enthusiastic about Battlebox which was good to see. The only bad bit about this tour was when it ended (and we came out to a thunderstorm)
A must see"
,,Guided tour was excellent,5.0,,The guide Joanna is an experienced guide. She knows her facts and makes the tour very enriching. She is friendly and obliging. Good job. Worth the money...
,,NB: Book a tour online in advance to ensure you don't turn up when the next tour is fully booked.,5.0,,"The guided tour of the Battle box is just the right length and goes into the appropriate areas of interest and levels of detail for the casual visitor.

It would be worth pre-arranging a tour rather than turning up at the visitors centre to book it - the next tour was fully booked when I arrived but this was a not a major issue as it gave me a window to visit the Singapore national museum located very close by."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Went on the ~ 1 hr Battlebox tour at 11:00 am (in English). The guide was Jerome and he was very knowledgeable. It was very interesting with stories, videos, artifacts, and a walk through the underground command center. Before I purchased the ticket I thought 18$ was a little pricey, but it was worth every cent. This will definitely remain as one of the most memorable things about Singapore.
PS. No photo-taking permitted inside."
,,For the fans of WW2 this is it !,5.0,,"This is a must see. It is a recreation of the last days before the surrender of the british army to the japanese. The bunker is located in Fort Canning about a 15 minutes uphill walk from the Fullerton hotel. It opens at 9h30 and the first guided tour starts at 9h45. You cant go in by yourself. The guide is very knowledgeable. There is also videos, pictures and artefacts of the period. The bunker is very well preserved an maintained. A very nice experience."
,,Fantastic Insight into the Fall of Singapore,5.0,,Guide provided excellent background on Singapore's history and what led to the fall of Singapore. We saw where the decision to surrender was made and understood what happened before and after this momentous decision. Got a feel for what it was like for so many to be confined to this underground space while the Japanese were advancing so rapidly. Decisions had to be made. Pressures would have been enormous. Excellent. We would definitely recommend a visit.
,,Battle box review,5.0,,"Excellent historical tour and a truly excellent guide. Can definitely recommend to all ages. The detail of the main ""decision"" room with the wax figures was very professional. Our guide was very knowelgeable and delivered her message with good presentation and a touch of humour for interest. Simply a superb tour."
,,Battle Box,4.0,,Interesting and informative tour with a knowledgable guide. Although we knew about the fall of Singapore to the Japanese we didn’t know much detail and this provided thus. It would have been nice to have had more artefacts from this period but it didn’t detract from the experience. Overall a really interesting and enjoyable couple of hours.
,,Brilliant history tour of WW2 Singapore,5.0,,"The team presenting this tour give a sincere account of good military tactics, under estimation of the enemy, poor preparations and personal sacrific of military personal and civilians resulted in the British capitulation of Singapore. Great story telling techniques. I highly recommend it for all age groups. Let us learn from this regretable time in history."
,,Singapore history,4.0,,"Stumbled across fort canning by accident and really enjoyed the tour.
The guide, Joanna was enthusiastic, knowledgeable and engaging.
The tour filled lots of gaps in my knowledge of WW2 and the part that Singapore played.
The replicas of the meeting rooms and situation rooms were really well done and the wax dummies were, I thought, quite realistic.
There were some children on my tour and although the guide warned that the tour was very detailed and informative, they coped very well. They were very well behaved children, but their interest was a testament to the quality of the experience.
Well worth the visit."
,,Interesting and informative tour.,5.0,,"The tour of this famous bomb proof underground command centre for the allied forces in Singapore during the the Malaysia campaign is well worth doing.
It is situated under Fort Canning easily accessed from the CBD by train or taxi.
The guided tour takes approximately an hour and a quarter.
The visitors centre is stocked with books and souvenirs relative to the tour.
Friendly staff and guides makes this a must do activity for anyone with an interest in history."
,,Unique Look at History,5.0,,"My husband’s a WWII buff. He had read great reviews of Battlebox and we were ‘t disappointed. The tour through a bunker used in the war, furnished with some of the original artifacts and figures and pictures of the officers who were there, brought the history alive, as did out guide Sha, whose combination of knowledge and humor made hearing the sometimes depressing story enjoyable and educational. I heard they’re thinking of replacing the live guides with recoded information. I think this would be a mistake, Part of the enjoyment was the group experience, with people sharing their knowledge, and Sha, a former soldier, adding his own anecdotes and observations. A unique experience."
,,Very informative,5.0,,"Due to some recent flooding of the Battle box, guided tours rather than audio tours are still the only way to see this command centre from WW2. Shar was a very informative interesting guide. It will be a shame for future tourists when he is replaced by an audio tour.
I did not know the history of Singapore and is surrender to the Japanese during WW2, but I do now! The exhibit underground with wax models, photos and videos is very well presented along with the excellent commentary. No photos allowed inside."
,,Awesome Tour!,5.0,,"The Battlebox tour is an informative and interesting insight to the fall of Singapore. Our guide, Shar was very passionate and informative about the history and events of this time. He provided an unbiased point of view and a detailed encounter to what occurred on both sides. Shar also catered for the diverse audience, from children to adults and ensures everyone was included.

Make sure you check the tour times, as there are no morning tours on Monday’s.

I would highly recommend this tour, and hopefully you will get Shar as your guide."
,,"Fabulous, dramatic WW2 Site",5.0,,"The Battle Box is a must see for learning about the Japanese theatre of WW2 and the key WW2 surrender of the British to the Japanese. Located at Ft. Canning, which is now a beautiful park overlooking Singapore, the Battle Box provides videos, dioramas, and photos to dramatically recreate the decision to and aftermath of the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese. The guides are very knowledgeable and the experience brings the visitors back to the dire situation faced by the British command as the Japanese closed in on Singapore, a key strategic military location for the British and their WW2 allies. Well worth a visit. Make sure you arrive early as the visits are all led by guides and limited in number."
,,Learning Experience,5.0,,"Fort Canning is a lovely place to wander around and enjoy the park area.
The Battle box tour was very informative & our Tour Guide knew her history and was very passionate about it and how it affected so many people
I was also quite surprised how quickly the Japanese moved on Singapore just days after Pearl Harbour , We were outclassed on so many fronts by a formidable Foe.
The European War seemed to consume any reason to have a decent defense in this part of the world.
Not much choice but surrender really , Poor buggers"
,,"Brilliant Battle Box, so interesting",5.0,,"Really pleased that the Battlebox has reopened. The guided tours are popular so arrive early to be certain of your place - the website lists the times for particular days. Our guide was knowledgeable and enthusiastic, really bringing the history to life. Fort Canning is a beautiful park with many walks, plants and historical buildings - take 2 - 3 hours to fully appreciate the area. The nearest MRT is Fort Canning on the Blue Line, opened in October 2017. If you're planning to visit Changi Museum then visit the Battlebox first to get the background information."
,,Interesting to visit,5.0,,Went round the grounds of Canning Hill and did a tour of the Battlebox which was the underground headquarters of the British Army in WW2 before they had to surender to the Japanese in 1942. Very interesting and informative. Only downside was there was only one place open to eat (they so sandwiches etc) or have coffee/tea which is an Ice cream cafe in the Arts centre on Canning Hill. Whole area worth a visit.
,,Another trip down memory lane,5.0,,"As somebody who went to school in Singapore from 1953 to 1957 and last visited Fort Canning in 1954 it was indeed a trip down memory lane. I am not one for 'Guided Tours' but this was one tour which was outstanding.

Our guide, by the name of 'Jerome' was clear and articulated and presented all the facts good and bad. I was fortunate enough to be with an Australian Historian whose added facts were most enlightening.

To me this was something special and it provided me with a very different perspective from what we were told as school children so many years ago. I guess we were given the 'pc' version.

I highly recommend a visit to Battlebox be it for historical interest or general interest, you will not be disappointed."
,,Great tour,5.0,,"This tour around the bunker gives some of the background and details that lead to the decision to surrender on 15 February 1942, the guide was very engaging and informed. The mock ups were nicely realistic and informative. A highly recommended tour."
,,Well done,4.0,,Excellent guided tour with a very informed guide. This is not a well advertised attraction however anyone interested in history should not miss this tour. Well preserved historical tribute.
,,Great experience,5.0,,"I took the 1-hour bunker tour. While the bunker itself was quite interesting, it was the way our guide Jerome presented the tour, that made this special.

As someone who wasn’t familar with Singapores history during WW II, I got a good understanding of what happened, which characters were involved and how it came to the decisions made.

Highly recommended and again a special thanks to Jerome!!!"
,,Interesting History,5.0,,"This place is a diorama of the situation during the war, what had happened and who are those figure they put there. Interesting."
,,Very well presented tour,5.0,,"Our guide, Mal, was very knowledgable and engaged in the history surrounding this well preserved historical site. Well worth the visit."
,,Historic places to visit!,5.0,,"A place to visit! You get to learn new things about the WW2 that are important and interesting that usually are left out of the history books. You get the chance to visit the bunker. Recommend you to take the one hour tour in the bunker and then walk around in the Fort Canning Park on your own. Our guide (Sharul) was really good, so friendly and knowledgeable."
,,Very interesting and surprising. Highly recommended,5.0,,"On my trip to Singapore last week we visited Battlebox. This was very well run and our tour guide was great. Informative and I wasn’t aware of so many Australian’s were involved. If you’re planning a trip to Singapore and like history, this is a must."
,,Excellent. Really enjoyed it,5.0,,"We did the Story of Strategy and Surrender Tour today. It was excellent. Really interesting. Amazing to see the actual bunker that was used. The tour lasted approx 1hr 15mins. Learned loads. Our tour guide , Mel, was very good. We were slightly early for our tour and Jeffrey, in the visitor centre, was excellent. He talked me through what else was around in Fort Canning Park. He was so helpful. Highly recommend Battlebox. It is the best thing that I have done in Singapore."
,,Fascinating history,5.0,,Had a good guide who described the advance of the Japanese into Singapore as if she had been there herself. No photos allowed but in 2018 there will be a self guided tour and photos will be allowed. Gift shop expensive.
,,Must See Historical Attraction,5.0,,"One of the main reasons I went to Singapore was to find out more about the Fall of Singapore and retrace the last footsteps of a family member. If you have an interest in WW2 history, The Battlebox is essential viewing.

Inside you will see authentic recreations of what was happening in 1942, complete with amazing artifacts. Several rooms depict their previous usage with authentic looking models - the're not dummies!

Our guide Sharel was very friendly and knowledgeable, such that he totally enhanced the whole experience. Sadly, no photography was allowed, but apparently next year the tour becomes self-guided and cameras will be allowed. (The downside to that is that there won't be a guide expertly taking you through the underground maze.)

Bear in mind that you will be underground and some areas are small. It was all well lit and air-conditioned, so comfort was not a problem. Upon entry, you need to descend some stairs and you will need shoes for safety.

I would highly recommend the Battlebox."
,,Very informative and interestingly done,5.0,,"It really explains the events leading up to this terrible time in history. The guide, Joanne, made it come alive for us and I do hope they continue to use guides rather than audios."
,,Informative,5.0,,Family of 4 with two boys 12 and 7. The combination of archival footage and wax figures in the bunker setting delivered a presentation that was interesting for my husband and me and sufficiently engaging for the kids (no easy feat). 35 minutes meant not too long for the 7 year old. We all learned something.
,,"Great insight into the fall of Singapore, led by an informative guide",4.0,,"I'm rather partial to my recent military history so a visit to the Battlebox was always going to be on the cards during my visit to Singapore. I wasn't disappointed, mainly because of the attitude, energy, knowledge and engagement of the guide who showed us around bringing to life the background to and the surrender of the British to the invading Japanese. Without him, I think the experience would've been vastly different. He told us that they will change to have self-guided tours next year which might miss a fair bit of the story-telling that brings the experience to life. My recommendation is to go whilst you can experience the human guides."
,,A must for those history buff & Historical Reenactor especially World War II,5.0,,"For those history enthusiast, history buff, and history reenactor, this place is a must, a definitely must. With good presentation by professional historian who has a passion in it, good material to present, and good place which managed greatly by professional, this place even impressed my sister who had little knowledge about history especially those of The World War II

[Note : If you are a World War II Reenactor, you definitely have to do some impression here, especially British Pacific World War II Impression]"
,,Fascinating tour encapsulates the wartime history of Singapore,5.0,,"This was a fascinating experience, bringing to life Singapore’s wartime history through the tour of the Fort Canning underground control centre and the excellent guide and short films. Highly recommend it."
,,Amazing guided tour,5.0,,"Apparently they will only be offering guided tours for a little longer, due to some flooding, they can’t let people wander.

That is a shame I think! We were fortunate enough to have “Sha” guide us. Easily the most informative guided tour I’ve been on! He went above and beyond to answer everyone’s questions and did an absolutely phenomenal job to keep us all engaged and hitting us with knowledge. This experience really exceeded my expectations!

As a Canadian, I was taught very little about Singapore’s difficult times during Japanese occupation, the content of the tour was presented in a way that was easy to follow and emotionally impactful. Thank you for sharing your history!"
,,"If you are interested in WWII history, don't miss this.",5.0,,"Very informative and well-presented tour by our guide and historian Jerome. The Battlebox tour gives a very good impression of what it was like when the Japanese invaded and conquered Singapore, and what the allied commanders were up against. If you are already visiting the National Museum, be sure to also include this tour to your day. Note that this museum can only be visited as a tour so be sure to check out the tour times."
,,Well thought out and well presented,5.0,,It would have been very easy for the Singaporeans to want to forget this painful time in their history so it is to their credit that they have utilised this fascinating facility to tell the story of the empire losses in WW2. The whole experience was though provoking and extremely well done
,,Expertise makes all the difference,4.0,,"A last-minute decision to take an out-of-town friend for a visit proved to be an excellent one.

This new incarnation of the Battlebox is run by professional historians and it shows in the best possible way. The tour was informative and well researched.

Gone are the old tacky animatronics statues. And instead we have guided tours with well considered use of short films to complete the experience. Our guide Jerome was knowledgable and clearly passionate about the subject.

As a Singaporean born and bred, I know about the Surrender and have had family members that suffered through the Occupation. However the tour brought new insights that imbued a story familiar to me with fresh poignancy.

One little thing: I would have liked a little more time to look at the displays - in particular the artefacts excavated from the area.

I would suggest checking out the times of the tours so you arrive on time."
,,Battlebox Tour,5.0,,"What an incredible tour and what an incredible tour guide Ewina ? My uncle was killed during the fall of Singapore in 1942 so for me this was a must do..The tour lasts for about two and a half hours taking in the early history of Singapore ,the Colonial History and of course the details of the events that led to the fall of Singapore.You will get to visit the Bunker which was the command centre for the defence forces and where the decision to surrender was made.Anyone with an interest in History and not just that of WW2 will really enjoy this tour and if you are lucky you will get the same guide as we did !"
,,Fantastic tour,5.0,,Hadn’t heard of Battlebox before this trip. So glad we found out about it. Excellent tour. Bunker is cool and very well set out. Our tour guide Mel was very engaging and knowledgeable. The kids didn’t loose interest on the 90min tour. One of the highlights of our trip to Singapore.
,,Very interesting tour,5.0,,"For anyone interested in history, and in particular WW2 this is a must visit during any trip to Singapore.

Beforehand I knew the basics, but thanks to our excellent guide Jeroen, this tour taught me so much more. If you're worried it's just a look around a dusty bunker, don't be, the trip takes you through the build-up to, the occupation of, and then the relief of Singapore and the end of WW2, explaining the whys and hows, rather than just saying what happened."
,,Great experience and WW2 history,5.0,,The battle box tour is great for anyone wanting to learn about Singapore during WW2. The tour goes for well over an hour throughout the bunker complex (which is air conditioned) going through most of the rooms where historical events took place. Our tour guide was a great presenter and told us a lot about the battle box and the war itself. This is a very good guided tour and is well worth it. i would recommend doing this tour then heading up to Changi museum as it ties in quite well with the history.
,,An unexpected pleasant surprise!,5.0,,"While walking through the city, I stumbled on to Fort Canning Park. It was situated on a hill, pretty and inviting, so I began to explore. After climbing a long stairway, I came upon the visitor center where tickets can be purchased for the Battlebox tour. Since I live near Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and appreciate WW11 history, I purchased a ticket. The tour was about 80 minutes long and extremely well presented. I learned so much. Our tour guide, a young man, was articulate and knowledgeable. His presentation was superb! The displays within the Battlebox are first class, extremely well crafted. It was one of the highlights of my visit to Singapore."
,,excellent tour of tunnels,5.0,,Jerome was an excellent speaker with so much knowledge. We enjoyed the tour immensely. Very emotional and educational.
,,Great look at WWII history,5.0,,"This is a great look at the fall of Singapore. Very interesting and a great tour. No worries, the bunker's are fully air conditioned so it isn't a sweat fest but you can imagine back in time, with so many men in such a confined space in such a stressful situation, the smell!
Overall a great tour if you're interested in WWII history."
,,Insightful & good value,5.0,,"I decided to do this at the 'last minute' but I'm very pleased that I made that decision. Currently the only way to see this museum (the WW2 underground command centre of the British in Singapore) is via a tour although as I understand it, this might change in the future.
There was small group of us on the tour and our guide was the excellent ""Shar"", he had been in the Singapore army and his genuine insight and interest in the actions and decisions that led to the ""biggest surrender of British led forces"" was compelling. I knew little of what happened before this tour but a sort of ""British Pearl Harbor"" really was an eye opener and would certainly interest anyone with even a vague awareness of such matters.
Whilst still allowing plenty of opportunities for questions, ""Shar"" spoke quickly but it never felt rushed as we moved from room to room gradually gaining a greater understanding of what actually happened leading up to 'surrender'. In some rooms we watched short Pathe type videos in others we were shown real items of interest e.g. graffiti from service personnel of the time, many rooms also had ""Tussauds type models""; everything was fascinating.
My only regrets were not being allowed to take photos (although in a tour like this it was understandable) and not having sufficient time to read the plethora of display materials: still that does mean that there's a reason to go back when the museum 'opens up' more although it would be a shame to put ""Shar""out of a job!"
,,Great insight into the reasons for the fall of Singapore in World War2,5.0,,"Everything about this tour was first class. The guide had tremendous enthusiasm and a great knowledge of the subject which he explained in a clear and interesting way.
The Battle Box only reopened recently after being close for over 12 months. Because of this we were unable to see it on previous visits to Singapore but we're pleased that it had re opened.
As well of the expertise of the guide the visit is enhanced by the the way in which the actual bunker has been brought back to life giving visitors a great insight of what it must have been like to work in.
The tour explained in clear detail the reasons why in spite of the large size of the British force they had no choice other than to surrender .
Cannot recommend this tour to highly."
,,Very high on the list of things to do in Singapore,5.0,,"I've been here twice in the past five years and I would recommend it to anyone, whether they are interested in history or not. It gives a fantastic insight into an important time in Singapore's development as a city and country. The guides are so knowledgeable and informative. I'm sure that you will be fascinated by the story this place has to tell."
,,Great Insight into the Fall of Singapore,5.0,,"This was an excellent tour of the underground bunker used by the British during WW2.
Our guide was super knowledgeable and spoke so eloquently about what was essentially a disaster for the inhabitants of Singapore and the allied forces.
If your a history buff you will enjoy this informative and entertaining tour."
,,The Battlebox Experience - Awesome Guided Tour,5.0,,"The organization and guide have probably done a lot of research. The tour is absolutely well-curated and each segment leading to the next just make the children and I follow closely with the guide, trying not to miss anything. The guide, Nancy is able to keep our interest and curiosity strong and we remained attentive throughout the 1.25 hours."
,,great,4.0,,"Went to visit the Battlebox and loved it. A lot of stairs to walk up , but was well worth. Well go back and have the experience again."
,,Battlebox very interesting guided tour,5.0,,"I wanted to visit the Battlebox to gain more insight into the fall of Singapore as my father was in the artillery in the 55 Brigade part of the 18th Division.
Our tour did not disappoint. Our guide was very knowledgeable and able to answer all our questions.. ...thank you.
The tour lasts about 90 minutes depending on the number of questions asked.
You get to go in the underground bunker and see how life was juring the last days before the surrender and all the stories as the war developed.
The rooms are done out just like they would have been with military personnel around the tables and briefing rooms. Even though they are mankins it's very realistic and with the commentary from the tour guide she brings it all to life.
We were even able to see maps of the troop positions day by day where I could see where my father was fighting the Japanese in trenches just 100 yards away....amazing.
The shop has lots of interesting books on the subject.
Well worth a visit and gets you out of the steamy heat of the day.
Many thanks to our tour guide who brought it all to life.
We also won the quiz at the end if the tour!
Well my wife did......"
,,Battle box guided tour,5.0,,A very interesting tour through the war bunker recounting the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese during WWII. Very reasonably priced and the guide was very knowledgable with a good mix of video footage etc
,,Definitely one to visit..,5.0,,This is a well organised and informative tour that explains a very important part of colonial history. Our group consisted of all ages and various nationalities..the guide spoke in English and answered each question as they arose...she was very knowledgable. This visit left me with a lot of questions and emotions regarding decisions made...definitely worth a visit.
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Plesant guide (Aysha) who took the group through the bunker and told us about the World war 2 years from the Singaporean view. Very interesting, especiallt for me who mostly have heard about the european sida of that war. I recommend this tour!"
,,interesting tour but a little long,4.0,,For WW2 history buffs this place is certainly worth a look . The tour although interesting could have been a little shorter and perhaps more upbeat.
,,Super-interesting and great guide!,5.0,,"The guided tour down the battle box bunker is amazing. The guide was really knowledgeable and a great storyteller. As a European, WWII has so often been about the nazis and soviets and less about colonialism and the Japanese so I truly learnt a lot. I would recommend the tour to anyone with an interest in 20th century history and WWII."
,,Fort High Light.,4.0,,"We walked all over the Fort finding this incredibly interesting. The information boards were helpful, although we did find one had a snake of 1.5-2 metres length on it (don't know if it was poisonous, didn't find anyone to ask)."
,,"Engaging, enthusiastic, knowledgeable and moving",5.0,,"Visited with my wife during a short trip to Singapore. The tour is an enthralling mix of audio-visual material and a fantastically engaging guide, Sharul in our case, who brings alive a series of tableaux representing the situation in the British and allied high command bunker in Feb 1942. Can’t speak highly enough of how this is all put together."
,,Pretty Interesting,5.0,,"This was a very interesting tour. Although living SG for already quite some time, I didn't know all the details on the tour. The tour might not be suitable for small kids, but very interesting for adults. Again the tour guide was amazing and very knowledgeable."
,,Worth a trip,5.0,,"The British troops surrendered 80 thousand army to 30 thousands Japanese.

Of course, museum staff will bring you all reasons.

Although I think Singapore weather and absence of air conditioning have to be blamed.

Seriously. In my motherland it had been called military lost of control. The worst what could happen. Generals were not heroes at all."
,,Well worth a trip,5.0,,"Currently, you have to do the tour to get into this interesting site, (in 2018 they are hoping to allow visitors to tour the site on their own), but don’t let that put you off – this is a great tour for an hour or so. I knew a bit about the surrender of Singapore, but I learnt a lot more, and of course you are actually in the place where the decisions were made. They also show you some interesting films of the invasion of the Malay peninsula and the surrender of Singapore itself. So if you have an interest in WW2 this is a must. We got there just before opening and beat the rush for the tickets. The site is below ground, has Air Con and is well lit so not too claustrophobic despite being in a bunker!"
,,Amazing exibition - gets you thinking,5.0,,"An excellent way of experiencing what it would have been like for anyone bunkered down in this facility during the war.

I was not aware of this aspect of WW2 and the speed of the Japanese advancement leading up to the invasion of Singapore itself.

While the facility is air conditioned today at the time of occupation and with the numbers of men involved there it would have been unbelievably uncomfortable.

A ""must see"" for everyone."
,,The Fort Canning Battlebox tour,5.0,,"The Battlebox tour was highly recommended to us by a friend back in Australia. We are so glad we went. The tour itself went for appx. 1-1/2 hour and was so informative & interesting from start to finish. The female guide (whose name I sadly didn’t get) was wonderful. She really made The Whole story about the fall of Singapore and the players involved really come to life and I think everyone in the room regardless to age learnt something new. Highly recommend this tour to anyone that may have an interest in the war years, Singapore and the duress & situation all involved found themselves. Having done Changi war museum last year this tour provided an excellent & complete view of the fall of Singapore and the tragic circumstances that followed."
,,"Educational, interesting and well conducted",5.0,,"During the one hour tour, the facts of that part of history were presented smoothly by a passionate guide who made the educational tour very interesting and attention grabbing. I learnt a lot. Worth visiting for both tourists and locals."
,,Amazing moment in history,5.0,,"This was an incredible tour. Our guide Jerome was informative, eloquent and gave us a wonderful commentary. It is a a very important moment in history and this tour summed up the events leading up to and culminating in the surrender of Singapore. Interspersed with Jerome's commentary were fascinating video clips including the moment when the 4 officers signed the surrender papers. We plan to come back during our next visit to Singapore."
,,"Great tour, great guide",5.0,,"As locals, there isn't much of Singapore that we haven't explored. This trip to the Battlebox was an impromptu one as we were in the vicinity and decided to check it out. At $18, we hesitated initially, but after the tour, we agreed that it was money well spent.

The tour was very well executed, and our guide, Kamaliah, was very knowledgeable and fluent. The 27 rooms in the bunker were well done up, containing detailed information and wax life-sized men to recreate scenes.

The tour group will be releasing self guided tours soon, but I'd still recommend the guided tour for a thorough and engaging visit."
,,A must do tour,5.0,,"We heard from another couple that this is the best tour in Singapore and it didn't disappoint. Shar our guide was engaging and knowledgeable. It was history that came alive and something we were unaware of. It was a humbling experience. A must do tour whilst in Singapore especially as it will be automated next year. This is a shame, it may not have the same impact as the retelling of the personal suffering the invasion had on family of the guide"
,,Not your ordinary tourist attraction,5.0,,Fascinating. Extremely good tour by fluent English speaker. The sort of history you don't usually get in museums - and you don't get taught n schools. Loved the visit.
,,Singapore's war history,4.0,,The tour (1h 15 min) was interesting. Guide was good and the tour was full of information for Singapore's history. Good choice for hot and steamy day.
,,"poignant, informative, thought provoking",5.0,,A must-do tour. Fascinating insight into a troubled period of the country. Incredibly knowledgeable guide. Thoroughly recommended.
,,Great tour Highly recommended .,5.0,,By far the best tour i have been on. Definitely go on the first tour at 9.45am as we only had 8 persons.. the next tour had 30 people. You only have around 10 stairs to go down and then its all flat.
,,Fantastic guide to a really interesting place,5.0,,"Visited with a couple of friends and had a wonderfully enlightening couple of hours. Utterly fascinating introduction to the surrender of Singapore in WW2, but even officianados would find out something new. Our guide, Shar, was an entertaining and highly knowledgeable guide. Well worth a visit. Go before the personal tours stop and the electronic self-guides are introduced."
,,A must See.,5.0,,"Worth booking in advance as the Tour soon fills up (on a weekend)
Tour Guide knew her stuff and rattled off all the key names on both sides easily.
The tour gave a sympathetic overview as to how the British lost Malaya and Singapore to a force inferior in numbers but not in cunning and Bravery.
The Worst disaster is BRITISH military history no amount of sugar will sweeten - So definitely worth 1/2 day of your time - The Park in which it’s located is worth the visit itself
Did I enjoy it - No as a Former Soldier but can I recommend it - of course it’s History."
,,Best kept secret in Singapore,5.0,,"Fort Canning park is a delightful park to visit and walk around, an Oasis of cool and shade. Within this park is an amazing secret, the Battlebox museum which is the underground bunker from which the decision to surrender to the Japanese was made in WW2, There are many rooms to view, short video's to watch, models and diorama's using footage and artifacts from the Imperial war museum and the Japanese archives too. This was fascinating, the air conditioning was most welcome. Our guide Sharul was friendly and very informative, allowing us as much time as we wanted, he kept our interest levels up, delighting us with his sense of humour. do not miss an opportunity to visit this museum"
,,Highlight of our visit,5.0,,"I came here with a little knowledge of the fall of Singapore, and left with a greater understanding of both this and the history of Singapore, thanks to a terrific guide. Thanks Rashul.
It is important to say that you do currently have to take one of the organised guided tours*.
We arrived too late for the 1hr Battlebox tour, so booked the 2.5 hour extended one the next day, and very glad we did.
This was a fascinating walk around the hill now called Fort Channing but which has been a seat of power in the region for over 700 years, all of which was carefully explained. We had toured the area on our own the day before and now realised just how much we had not understood without informed commentary.

*We were told that there are plans to introduce audio self touring headsets in the future. There is a place for these ( and I guess this may permit a basic commentary in other languages and may work for larger groups) but my wife and I do not believe that the sheer passion and depth of knowledge of the guides can be substituted, and must be retained."
,,Fascinating insight to a significant historical event...,5.0,,"Extremely interesting and worthwhile tour that was interactive and informative for the one hour duration.
Our guide Jerome explained the history of the capture of Singapore by the Japanese with very good knowledge and lots of enthusiasm that kept us all engaged and keen to learn more.
I recommend this for all ages (with the exception of perhaps the very young)."
,,A surprising opportunity to learn and feel some of Singapore's history,5.0,,"A tourist destination with a surprisingly good experience. Nor your obvious destination when you think of Singapore's tourist attractions but this is really a good visit to do .It is located within the wartime bunkers of the Allies on Fort Canning Hill, a greenland sanctuary amongst the city concrete. The 90 minute tour within the bunker is expertly narrated by guides (well, ours anyway) - she knew her hisory and made the story come alive with stories. Sugges touy look at their website to get a full description and then decide the time you wish to visit - they have about 4 tours per day."
,,History in a living surrounding,5.0,,You get the experience of World War I and II. Rooms and life of the soldiers are in good conditions to make clear that it was not the tropical paradise. With the battle room you get in information about the cruelty of the invasion by the Japanese during the WWII.
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"An excellent experience for the entire family including children! Tour was incredibly interesting and informative and conducted by a guide who managed to answer all our questions. Particular highlights were the movies detailing Japanese progress, real artefacts on display and countless dates and facts about particular men that were provided. Also enjoyed the gift shop with its many books and souvenirs. Will make sure to return and highly recommend even if you have little historical passion. Definitely deserves its place as best museum in Singapore. Only thing I would say is make sure to come at the time of a guided tour. However, if you are early, the surrounding park and sites are amazing too and include a great café, arts centre, lighthouse, garden walks and Raffles House."
,,Great historical site,4.0,,"The only way you can get into the battlebox is by a guided tour. The guide was very informative, and there is some great history for the site - providing an insight into the fall of Singapore.
The only pity is that no photos are allowed in the battlebox.
Takes about 1.5 hours, quite popular and gets booked out quick."
,,A fascinating insight into this crucial part of history,5.0,,The tour of the Battlebox was impressive. Aysha our guide kept us all entertained with details and explanations of many aspects of this period in history.
,,Top Class,5.0,,"I visited the Battlebox for the first time in 2011 and the tour was average at best. Today it was amazing. A whole new perspective and much more detail. Our guide Sharul is really enthusiastic, friendly and knowledgeable. Well done Sharul!"
,,An absolute must for anyone with an interest in the History of Singapore.,5.0,,A fantastic insight into the history of Fort Canning and in particular it part in the dramatic events leading to the fall of Singapore during World War Two. Our guide 'Mel' was very knowledgeable and managed to bring the facts to life with an enthusiastic style. all in all a Singapore visit highlight. Booking in advance is recommended as there are limited places on the tours.
,,Myths Exploded,5.0,,"The highlight of my time in Singapore. The 75 minute tour lasted 90 minutes. I was happy about that.

Tour guide, Jerome, was knowledgeable and made tour interesting as he was busy destroying myths I had grown up with.

I thought $18 represented good value for money. The tour site was comfortable and clean.

Good job Jerome!"
,,History buffs don't miss this!,5.0,,"If you're into history, then visiting the Fort Canning and Battlebox is a must do! You need to book in advance as it is not open 7 days a week, the guide will tell you all about the surrender of Singapore during WW2. Absolutely fascinating to hear how happened and couldn't be avoided and also the tragic consequences thereafter to the men who suffered terribly at the hands of the japenese. The biggest military surrender in British history. Even though I have been to Singapore before, it was good to hear about the history of the island."
,,Battle Box,5.0,,Very good. Must see!! Very similar to Churchhill's war room in London. Besides the war room The tour informs us how Malaysia and Singapore fell in the Second World War.
,,Great tour guide,5.0,,"Every time my Husband and I go to Singapore he asks to go to the battle box, this time i gave in and we made time for it. I am sorry i didn't go sooner. The tour was amazing, and so informative.

I would recommend spending the morning at the museum and heading to the box for the 2pm or 4pm tour. As the museum has a lot of information about the war and this will help you understand everything that you see in the battle box.

I am not a history buff, while my Husband is. I still loved every minute of the tour.

100% worth the ticket price, worth the walk up the hill from the museum, worth every minute."
,,Very interesting place to learn Singapore's history in WW2,4.0,,Very informative tour on Singapore and British role in WW2. Guided tour in the underground command center of the British military until their surrender to the Japanese in February 42. A must see
,,Enjoyed our visit to the Battle Box,5.0,,"My family of four really enjoyed our guided tour of the Battle Box. Mel was a great guide with outstanding knowledge and very good English. We found the tour to be very informative and we enjoy the displays, photos and videos. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Take a walk back into history,5.0,,"This was a fabulous experience and the guide was well informed about the battle of Singapore ,

The battle took place in 1942 and this place was where the command Centre was and the place where the British , Australians decided to surrender to the cruelest of enemies of all the imperial Japanese army. The informative guide was friendly and knew his stuff . No photography or sound recording is allowed , the entrance fee is about $14 for around a 2 hour commentary well worth the money , excellent value
I recommend this to visitors"
,,Highlight of our stopover,5.0,,"My husband and myself had been to Singapore several times before, but decades ago, and had never heard of Fort Canning. So when we heard of this this tour and subject, thought that it was would be something different and of interest. We weren't disappointed and found the tour both interesting and informative. The room reconstructions were very realistic and made it easy to imagine what it would have been like at the time. I cannot recommend it more highly for anyone with even the the remotest interest in history."
,,Very Interesting,5.0,,You have to take a tour to gain access to the battle box. Our guide was fantastic. We had our 2 children with us and we all learnt alot about Singapore's history.
,,Loved the figures,5.0,,"This was a great snapshot of the Fall of Singapore in WW2. Its not a long experience, just over an hour but it uses a variety of techniques - guided tour, film and life sized diorama recreation to explain the story of the fall of Singapore. The mannequins and the recreations of the rooms in the underground bunker are eerily realistic and our tour guide Nancy(?) was a great and informative story teller. This is a must-do. We did it the wrong way round - see this first, then visit Changi Prison Museum as they go well together"
,,Battlebox historic tour,5.0,,"It was an amazing and very insightful tour which was quite moving and very well presented. Our tour guide Jerome was extremely knowledgable and he gave an exceptional presentation of what was an incredible account of events and horrific conditions during the fall of Singapore back in 1941. It was very informative and a tour you will never forget. Thank you Jerome, a highly recommended tour!"
,,Best history attraction by far,5.0,,"So this place tries to take you back to the world war 2 and succeeds in that.
It is a great experience and gives a good view on to the most appalling time in singaporean history
This should not be missed as it is quite interesting.
Shout out to kamaliah who is the tour guide over there and does a fab job"
,,a rewarding climb for history buffs and Veterans.,4.0,,"From a personal point of view, I am very interested in Singapore history so it was worth the quite difficult climb up through the tropical gardens.This could be difficult for people with mobility problems.The knowledge of the guide is phenomenal however one problem for me was the delivery was quite rapid which stopped me absorbing the information before moving straight to the next room/subject. Again, on the mobility theme, a lot of the time you are stood listening for quite a long period and a few chairs scattered around could be helpful. the films were excellent and the place is very atmospheric. A must for the history buff or military veteran."
,,Battlebox Tour,5.0,,"This tour brings the Singapore experience of World War II to life! Jerome was our guide, and he was excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of the tour, and lunch at the hotel was also excellent.

For anyone with any interest in World War II history - it is a MUST SEE!!"
,,excellent blast to the past!,5.0,,"THE GOOD: interactive exhibits, presents facts into bite sized presentations, great for the old & young!!! THE BAD: some themes are not suitable for the young TIPS: place is quite isolated... be prepared to walk..."
,,A Must Visit For Everyone Interested in Singapore History,5.0,,Only had time to do the 75-minute 11:00 tour on 26 Sep 2017 and really enjoyed it. Jerome is a superb guide. The entire Fort Canning area is well worth a leisurely tour for all those of us who want to see and learn more than is available at the usual glitzy tourist areas. I'll do the longer tour on my next visit
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"We took a tour, lasts about an hour, lots of steps if you also go into the gardens, but extremely interesting if you are interested in the WWII era."
,,Lively and very informative.,5.0,,"The Battle Box is a very important part of Singapore's WW2 history. Our guide, Sharul, described the significance of the various rooms we entered and vividly portrayed the situation and strategy which culminated in the surrender. The original artefacts displayed were an emotional reminder of the tragedy. Original film from the period contributed to the story but learning about it from a real person who's family may have had a direct link to the events had a much greater impact than a prerecorded digital guide could ever achieve ."
,,The Battlebox Tour,4.0,,"Very informative and interesting tour. The guide, Shah was extremely knowledgeable and this really made the tour very engaging! So refreshing to be guided by a person rather than a set of headphones!"
,,Excellent guided tour (so far!),5.0,,"In order to understand the short but very diversified history of modern Singapore the WW 2 chapter delivers very interesting details to better understand the big picture. Our guide, a former Sergeant of the Singapore Army, has impressed all of us by his detailed Knowledge of the hardest years of this small and strategically important Country.
Fantastic tour- worth every Penny!

All visitors have struggled with the plan to replace the guide in the nearer future by audiotours. Sorry, but this idea sucks. The guide made the difference between an ordinary and an excellent tour. Have you every asked an audio device a question and have been happy with the answer? Keep the human guide and the visitors happy!"
,,Sobering insights delivered with balance & professionalism,5.0,,"Jerome guided us through this turbulent and difficult part of Singapore's history with professional balance and great insight. His knowledge, experience and well honed presentation skills made this tour engrossing and so informative Highly recommended."
,,History that has to be experienced,5.0,,"I went to Changi memorial, then the Battlebox, but left the best until last. Go now before the guides are replaced by self-guided tours. You can't get the feel of being 3 stories underground in a working bunker by reading a book or looking on the internet, you've got the walk through it, smell it and hear it. The curators have done a great job of bringing it alive! No cheesy mannequins here. Each room is inhabited by very lifelike wax models of the key players. Our Guide, Jerome also did a great job of conveying all of the context, background and detail that we needed to understand how the British (and Japanese) got themselves into their final situations using Maps, videos and stories. The tour was a well organised combination of videos, maps, photographs and displays covering political, military and personal stories of the downfall of Singapore ( and it's ultimate recovery)"
,,Informative tour,4.0,,"Visited September 2017. The Battebox tour was very interesting and informative, explaining it's role in WW2 and providing an understanding of what it was like to work in the Battlebox and the issues encountered.

Tour lasts approx. 1 hour 15 mins and the info office and start of tour is within walking distance of Dhoby Ghaut MRT."
,,Tours book out!,5.0,,"This tour was brilliant and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Our guide Kamaliah was outstanding - so knowledgeable and a consummate communicator. The experience includes walking through the bunker listening to the guide's commentary, watching excellent short videos and viewing photographs, artefacts and interpretive panels. The displays are very good, and the models of the people who worked there are uncannily realistic. My only concern is that tours are limited and they book out. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be possible to book online so best to get there early as this is an experience not to be missed. I combined it with a visit to the Changi Museum (free entry) which I would also highly recommend."
,,Informative Trip,4.0,,"Was well presented by knowledgeable staff about the lead up to the fall of Singapore, the fall of Singapore, the aftermath and then what happened after the war ended."
,,Great insight,4.0,,"After visiting a similar bunker in Malta.... this was really interesting only downside the artifacts had been looted....
The tours fill up quickly so get there early or maybe book ahead if that is possible.... the video and guide both really helped set the scene and explain the history....
Will be great when the nearby mrt station opens but the directions on the website easy to follow"
,,Don't miss it if you want something original,5.0,,"The tour was good but the experience of being in a bunker was brilliant. Later in our stay, we went to the former Form Factory where the surrender was signed. Going between the two places was truly amazing; understanding just how far the British had to walk to get from the bunker, their headquarters, to the site of the surrender, was very humbling."
,,Battle box tour,4.0,,"Attended the Battle box tour last weekend, the guide was full of interesting information we were not aware of on the surrender of Singapore and the retaking of it. Well worth the visit as well as a walk around Cannon Hill park and gardens"
,,Great WWII History,5.0,,Great WWII History tour of the place where things really happened. Excellent guided tour. Very informative and our tour guide Sharul is very knowledgeable and very enthusiastic!
,,Great experience,5.0,,Very informative- well researched. Learned a lot about WW2. Disappointing that they will soon do away with human guided in favor of self guide. Will loose the warmth an interested and passionate guide can bring.
,,"Interesting, but overpriced.",3.0,,"I was really excited to go and see this attraction. The concept appealed to me and I went to walk around the park prior to the tour also. The tour itself was led by Nancy who was great. She knew a lot about the history and was also a very engaging speaker. I guess the issue is that she had kids and a wide range of people in the group (some of whom kept talking), which was a bit annoying. I've given 3*s though as I feel that it is pricey for what it is, especially in comparison to the other museums around which offer cheaper entry and free guided tours.

If you want a bit of WW2 history, then you can try the National Museum also, but at $18-22 per person for a 1h15 tour, this is at the top end of the market in Singapore."
,,Excellent tour of the world war 2 bunker,5.0,,My wife and I found the tour of the Battlebox very interesting. The guide was extremely informative and the tour gave a vivid description of the events that developed during the siege of Singapore during world war 2.
,,Brilliant Tourist attraction for adults,5.0,,Great place to while away several hours for adults with an interest in international history. Kids may be intrigued but should be prepped before hand to maintain their interest. This display is highly rated on the intentional level particularly for those travellers from the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries. I'd od it again.
,,Fascinating Family visit!,5.0,,"Good and fascinating family visit. Our kids are 9 and 11 years old, and I would not recommend it for younger children."
,,Great History Lesson,5.0,,This is a great tour with an amazing story. We did the tour with two young children who also enjoyed the history lesson. It's a little over an hour and quite informative. Jerome our tour guide was excellent and we highly recommend visiting the Battlebox.
,,Amazingly interesting,5.0,,"This was an excellent tour with commentary on the fall of Singapore in WW2. Our tour guide, Mel, was absolutely fantastic! Totally knowledgeable about all aspects of the subject and extremely personable. Her delivery and expression kept our interest to a maximum for over an hour. The setup inside the battlebox is very well done, with lifelike wax figures depicting events which would have happened at the time. Lots of informative photographs throughout as well. Great website, also, with perfect visual instructions on how to get there. Thanks to all concerned for a job well done."
,,Great little history lesson,5.0,,"Recently we did the Battlebox Tour with Guide Kelysha. Kelysha is a student of History and it showed - her information was so well delivered and she had an obvious interest in what she was doing. We were impressed. The area around the Battlebox, Fort Canning Park, is worth a visit too."
,,Your of Battlebox,5.0,,Our your guide was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. As ex military he gave his professional opinion on how the events leading to the surrender were wrongly handled. A very moving experience. Fort Canning as a whole well worth a visit.
,,Unexpected Highlight,5.0,,Went to Battle box on a whim. A great experience. Shar our guide was very knowledgeable and enthusiasm for the history was infectious. A very enjoyable experience. Will recommend to all our friends at home.
,,Great attraction,5.0,,This is a must see if you are in Singapore and have any interest in what happened there during WW2. A very informed guide gives you the voiceover as you walk around the actual bunker rooms where history played out over 70 years ago.
,,A historical experience,5.0,,"If you're always wanting to expand your knowledge in WW2 historical places, this is a must see. The tour was very informative and the guides had alot of knowledge in the events surrounding the battlebox. It's a definite must see if you're in Singapore."
,,A must visit to this WW2 site,2.0,,Worth visit if it free but not worth it if need to pay and see this historic place where internet can provide all this history.
,,Educational and great experiance,5.0,,"This is not for small children unless of interest ,But for adults this is a must its not theme park excitement its educational and I have to say my knowledge was lacking I was riveted from start to finish the entrance is around £10 or S$18 i think ,
The guide was very knowledgeable is English was better than mine and I give him 10/10 for is interpretation of the story to tell the video to enhance the tour was excellent and I came away with a feeling of fulfillment on my new knowledge of the history of WW2 and its downfall for Allied troops and Singapore and Malaysia if you love history this is best S$18 for hour 15 min you could spend and the history of the hill before the bunkers military ,
The staff are second to non helpful and knowledgeable so its 100% must if your into history , to get their its easy its on the MTR route red line Dhoby Ghaut get off walk towards WMCA actually its the women WWCA and its behind the hotel ,its not far to walk and the park its in is a must .
This as a guide in small batches think its last trip is 4pm check web site no tour with out guide as it be pointless ."
,,Great Tour,4.0,,"Great Tour, Staff and guides were well informed and had great knowledge of the period in WWII. Tour was slightly over crowded for size of the battle box (although it gave a rough feel for what former military personnel went through). Tour also felt rushed with not much time for looking at displays and information around the battle box. Still great tour would definitely recommend this to others. 4.5/5"
,,Excellent tour,5.0,,Informative and enjoyable tour. Well worth a visit when in Singapore. Not too long but a lot of information is packed in. Very nice and enthusiastic staff too.
,,Riveting tour of the fall of Singapore,5.0,,"Guide was very good in his ability to tell the story of how Allied troops surrendered to Japanese in Singapore. Really is an eye opener. Loved it, highly recommended. Kids below 10 might find it too boring.
If you want to do the 11am tour, get there by 10.15 to book tickets as it fills up fast after that. They don't do online bookings."
,,Great insight into the history of Singapore,5.0,,"Really interesting guided tour of the underground bunker where the British Command was based at the end of WW2. Our guide, Jerome, was very knowledgeable and passionate and his presentation made the whole experience one to be remembered. It's quite sobering to walk in the footsteps of the officers who had to make a difficult decision in the face of overwhelming odds. Take a wander around Fort Canning park while you are there, the gardens are lovely."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,A really good informative tour I thought I knew my history. But this informed tour was great The guide was excellent And the fort impressive Really really worth it Don't miss the history
,,Excellent Tour,5.0,,We visited the Battlebox today and can't recommend it highly enough. Our tour guide was Joanne and her knowledge and enthousiasm kept us enthralled. Cannot recommend highly enough.
,,Singapore Battle Box Bunker,5.0,,"Anyone interested in the WW2 in Asia will find this a gem. Easy to find by walking through the park. Starting the tour at the information centre with a guide leading to the entrance of the bunker. From the entrance it starts very informative all the way until the end.
I won't go into detail, only it's a must, if you have got a spare couple of hours."
,,Experience not to be missed,5.0,,"Excellent visit with erudite guide, Jerome, who spoke clearly and knowledgeably Fascinating facts with moving details of the unspeakably difficult decisions for those in charge at the time. The 90 minutes went quickly."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,Battlebox is highly recommended. We walked up to Fort Canning Park from the centre of town and joined a guided tour which was full (note that you have to join such a tour to visit the bunker and if you ring in advance they will reserve you a place) .Our young guide Jerome (resplendent in blazer and tie) was an excellent guide mixing a vast array of historical and informative knowledge with some good humour. The bunker after years of neglect has only recently been restored and amongst original artefacts and lifelike wax models the background to the surrender of Singapore in 1942 is very well recreated through a vivid presentation including original film footage.
,,A must for anyone interested in WW2 history,5.0,,"When arriving in Singapore we had heard good things about this museum, and myself having a real intrest in WW2 history I was eager to visit.
The museum has kept battlebox in it's historical location of Fort Canning, the entrance fee seemed little pricey yet we realised we had a very well educated guide who was fantastic and adding to this the tour took close to 2 hours. Therefore it is easily worth the entrance fee and it is Singapore after all.
The museum itself has been set out in a great way keeping battlebox mainly how it was rediscovered, graffiti still on the walls from the British officers.
I couldn't recommend this enough, we even won a souvenir from the gift shop as the guide has some questions at the end to check if you were paying attention."
,,Educational,5.0,,"You have to go on a tour here so check the times before you go. It's an interesting history lesson about the fall of Singapore, a wartime event that most Australians over 50 know about but don't necessarily know the details."
,,Brilliant Battlebox,5.0,,"Very pleased I decided to do the Battlebox tour in Fort Canning Park. A fascinating journey through the 55 days it took for the Japanese to conquer the Malayan peninsula and ultimately Singapore in 1941/42. Kamaliah our guide was fantastically knowledgable and both enthusiastic and unfailingly helpful. The restorations and recreations of the scenes and themes which unfolded in the Battlebox during those dark days are extremely well done and provide a sympathetic and common sense explanation to why these events occurred and the characters behind them. You'll need to plan for about an hour and a half, the visitors centre has a selection of related articles for sale, along with cold drinks which you will need in typical Singapore humidity. Enjoy!"
,,history brought alive,4.0,,"its often hard to understand certain things said in the books. here history is created alive. with the different displays and multi media, it makes learning about the past more exciting."
,,A Must Do,5.0,,"As a more mature woman I did not really have any interest in doing this tour but knew that my husband would find it interesting. Well how wrong was I? Yes, my husband was greatly interested but so was I. Our young female guide really knew her stuff, and didn't give the impression that she did the same thing day after day; she even managed to bring some levity into what is a very serious historical event. The realism of the underground bunkers helped to reinforce the magnitude of the unfolding events portrayed. One ended up feeling sorry for the men who meet in order to come to a decision that they knew would greatly affected the lives of so many, including their own. Don't miss it."
,,Incredibly educational and eyeopening,5.0,,Just fabulous. Jerome the tour guide was so knowledgeable and to get the experience of walking around this bunker and reliving those fateful days before the British surrendered to the Japanese was amazing.
,,A step back in time,5.0,,The guided tour was very informative and the presentation of each room was so realistic. A real insight into Singapore's role in the war.
,,Fabuolous tour!,5.0,,"We did this tour this morning and they limit numbers so it was great. We arrived and booked in at 10am for the 11am tour. The whole of the surrounding gardens are beautiful. We loved the tour as it was very informative. Aisha, our guide was certainly knowledgeable. I really liked that she didn't sound as if she did the same thing repeatedly - she obviously knew and liked her job. I really liked the way she used different methods to inform us - talking, video and photos etc. I highly recommend this tour."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,This was one of the absolute highlights of our recent visit to Singapore. Our history loving son had recommended it to us and as it was close to our hotel decided to go. Thank goodness we did. It was absolutely riveting and gave us such an in depth understanding of one part of the fall of Singapore. The guide was highly intelligent and totally interested in her topic. She was able to answer all of the questions asked whether relevant or not. I loved it.
,,Extremely Interesting,5.0,,We decided to revisit the Battlebox after a few years. They seem to have changed it to a free guided tour. This makes it far more interesting and points out things you would probably have overlooked on your own. Well worth a visit.
,,A must for war buffs.,5.0,,If you are interested in WWII and the fall of Singapore this is a must visit for you. Make sure you take the tour to get the most out of the experience. The underground bunker really gives you a feeling for the time. We often know a little about our own nations role in the war but this gives a perspective from the locals who suffered even more than than the allied forces.
,,Very good place for history lovers,4.0,,this is recently opened place at fort canning this will take you to one of the darkest phase of Singapore history when Singapore was surrender to Japan. the best part is this is guided tour and they will give you detailed information.
,,wanted to learn history,4.0,,"we visited on our last day and did the hour and a half tour,guide was informative and wasnt expensive.I would have liked to have gone around on our own but they are looking into this.Staff are very helpful and friendly it was very interesting anyone wanting to know about how the british lost singapore go and do the tour."
,,"A private company has taken over this site, which is good and bad",3.0,,"Good that they are putting money into renovating more rooms, bad because now you must go on guided tour and a pay much higher price then before.

I self-toured this site 3 years ago at a fraction of the current price and learned almost as much useful information as you now get from a 45 minute tour. Honestly, the tour was too long. Now that there are more rooms open to view, I really fell they added over 20 minutes of unnecessary and often uninteresting information was added to the tour guide spiel just to fill in the additional time it takes to walk thru the bunker.

What my group all quickly picked up on the tour was the defensive tenor of the spiel, a continual verbal defense of General Percival’s decision to surrender Singapore. All main discussions led to ‘explanations’ of the surrender, over and over, as if the whole tour dialogue was written by his descendants trying to clear his name! The waste was that there was no reason for the excessive defense of Percival’s action and no blemish on the family to erase – the surrender was a logical decision by a honorable man that is unquestioned by history.

Despite the deficiencies of the new tour set up, the Fort Canning bunker site is worth the visit as one of the few solid pieces of the WWII history left in Singapore."
,,Interesting and informative.,5.0,,"We are 2 young adult females backpacking asia and would not usually go to this sort of thing unless it was free, typical backpackers, however we read great reviews and wanted to learn about singapores history. Our guide Lyende was great, she was so passionate and enthusiastic about everything it was really refreshing and easy to take in the information she was telling us, it was nice to be guided by someone who loves her job. The tour was supposed to be 2hrs 30 mins but it was more like 3 hours because of how indepth it all was, really enjoyed it!
Really came away thinking about the history of singapore, malaya, japan and the british empire."
,,Battlebox Tour,4.0,,"The guide was very knowledgeable and had a lot of history to impart to us, so had to speak quite quickly. A very worthwhile tour to take."
,,A Not-So-Secret Gem,5.0,,"After exploring the beautiful parklands of Fort Canning, it was a delight to discover the Battlebox. The tour 'A Story of Strategy and Surrender' led by Jerome was fantastic. Giving the visitor excellent insight into the creation of the bunker, the outbreak of the war, the key figures who worked within those walls and the outcome of surrender.

The tour flowed seamlessly, moving us through the bunker with visual aids, historic artifacts, mannequin displays and videos. Without the tour guide, Jerome, keeping us informed and entertained at every stop, even providing additional precise information for any questions asked, the Battlebox would not have become such a fond memory of my travels to Singapore.

If you have any interest in the history of Fort Canning, WWII Pacific campaign or the surrender of Singapore - Battlebox is a must see."
,,A piece of history,5.0,,"After the end of the war, the Battlebox remained hidden, unknown, for 40+ years. The only clue there was anything inside the mound was a door with a padlock on it - as the guide said ""looking a bit like a garden shed"". Finally, a journalist, having heard rumours of something under the hill, broke the padlock and found this historic series of chambers which housed the British WWII Underground Command Centre. It was inside one of these underground rooms that the historic decision was made to surrender Singapore to the Japanese, in the hope of saving the lives of many soldiers and civilians. Entrance is by guided tour only, and the entrance money helps support the maintenance of the site. Our guide, Jerome, certainly knew his facts, and communicated it to us all in a very clear manner. Well done, and thank you, Jerome!"
,,interesting history,4.0,,"prior to visiting we were totally unaware of this piece of history so we both found it very informative , it was good to hear about the struggles previous generations had gone through and this countries history"
,,A must,5.0,,"We visited as a family of four and had a great tour of the battle box. The tour is really good because you get a good overview of the history of Singapore as well as an understanding of the forces that were at play in South East Asia during WW2. But don't think this tour is for history buffs; it is for anyone who wants to get an understanding of the history of Singapore including the decline of the British Empire in the Far East. Perhaps the strongest element was the way the guide brought to life the narrative of the people who worked in the Battle Box, those affected by the Japanese invasion and the terrible dilemma with which Percival and Simmons wrestled. If you want to understand Singapore you could do worse than first understand the history and heritage of the Battlebox.

Highly recommended."
,,Fantastic insight,5.0,,"Jerome was a fantastic guide, he had so much knowledge and presented it in an interesting manner. I went with my 11 yr old son and my father and all of us thoroughly enjoyed the tour. It was very informative and there was much more to see than we anticipated.
A definite highlight of our trip."
,,A highlight of our Singapore stay.,5.0,,"In Singapore with elderly parents and thought this would be a good tour for my father. Jerome, the tour guide, made an informative tour memorable and it was a great prelude to Singapore Museum, which is just down the road. Thank you Jerome"
,,Good informative tour,5.0,,"We managed to squeeze in the battle box tour on our last day in Singapore and it was definitely worth it. Our tour guide, Mel, was very knowledgeable and friendly and clearly loved what she did. The tour lasted for about 1 hour and there was not a dull moment - the combination of Mel talking, informative Videos and very real looking wax works inside the Battle Box all made it a great experience. Even if you're only in Singapore for a short amount of time this is a must see! Very reasonably priced as well."
,,"Excellent, simply excellent",5.0,,"This is a fascinating and hugely informative tour of the under ground command headquarters of the British during the Japanese invasion of Singapore during WW2. With Britain struggling to fight on two fronts and Europe being the priority, it left Singapore very defenceless when the Japanese invasion came. This tour tells this story of in Churchill's words 'the worst capitulation in British Military history' - and much more besides esp the horrific treatment of the local populace and POW's by the Japanese afterwards. The tour takes about 90 minutes, unfortunately there are plans for self guided tours to begin later in the year but the guided tours really are fantastic and our one called 'Shar' was simply amazing and extremely knowledgeable. If you only do one guided tour in Singapore, make it this one."
,,Stunningly informative,5.0,,I am originally from Singapore but I had not heard about this museum until recently. It is a fascinating destination in itself - a previously undiscovered bunker from WWII. The museum is a sensitive and intelligently curated collection of artefacts giving a rounded and balanced view of the events leading to the Fall of Singapore and the surrender to the Japanese. The key players are recreated in wax and there is real footage from the period. The best part is the guided tour. Jerome gave us a very interesting and insightful tour. My children are young but they were totally fascinated and engaged. A very worthwhile visit and not to be missed.
,,Incredible way of gaining an understanding of the fate of Sinagpore re WWII,5.0,,"Could this place be where the ‘history buff’ says have a nice afternoon/morning to the ‘shopperholic’? Hmmm... It is located with the lush green and quite Fort Canning Hill, the underground bunker was designed to withstand aerial bomb attacks and gas attacks during the world war. There are some 20 rooms comprising the bunker complex. Recommend doing a guided tour as it gives such an appreciation of the difficult decisions the generals and their staff had to make during WWII regarding the Japanese invasion. [FYI: By October 20017, the Fort Canning MRT should be open which will it very easier to visit Fort Canning Hill]."
,,Fascinating History,5.0,,"Recently did the Singapore Battlebox and Fort Canning Hill Tour. First part of the tour was the Fort Canning Hill covering the history of the area from the Malay Sultans to the British. Takes you through a Sultans Burial site, the Spice Gardens and Singapore's first Christian cemetery. The cemetery is long gone, but a lot of the headstones have been preserved in the wall. Continue to the Fort Gates, then to the highlight of the tour, the Battlebox itself. A fascinating insight to the British predicament following the Japanese invasion. Tour through each of the rooms, many set up as the would have been when the Battlebox was operational. A few short videos were show throughout the tour, many featuring actual footage from the war.
Everything was well explained throughout.Tour was scheduled for 2 1/2 hours but ours went over 3 hours as everyone was so interested and kept asking questions. This was not a problem for our guide, I think he would have been happy to keep answering our questions as long as we kept asking them.
Overall an excellent tour and a must for any history buff with a few hours to spare i Singapore."
,,Battlebox guided tour,5.0,,"I have been sharing a holiday in Singapore with friends and we enjoyed a tour of the battlebox, guided by Nancy who was a fabulous and well informed guide. The tour was large with around 20 people, however it was easy to hear Nancy's stories. Really enjoyed and pleased to have seen this piece of Singapore's history."
,,The bunker where Singapore's fate to the Japanese was decided,5.0,,"If you love your history and want to get away from the shopping, hustle and bustle of the food and restaurants come here. Located at Fort Canning Hill, inside it is a underground bunker designed to withstand bomb attacks and gas attacks during the world war. The guided tour will bring you through each of the 21 rooms where the generals and their staff made important military decisions from the WWII Japanese invasion. In the end there is a surprise question with a special prize (a copy of the signed surrender from the Japanese after the WWII) so pay attention carefully. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and engaging with each visitor. It was raining so they even had umbrellas for us to walk to the Port Sally / Entrance to the Battlebox command centre."
,,Fascinating!,5.0,,"I would definitely recommend a visit, especially if you're interested in history! We went on the guided tour and our guide Jerome was great! It was really interesting to listen to all the events that occurred and see what life would have been like in the bunker. 10/10 to Jerome for also recognising my scouse accent as I've been mistaken for being Irish a lot over here"
,,Story of Singapore's surrender,4.0,,"Heard about this place having visited Changi Museum,earlier in the week. Went on the 1 hour 15 minutes tour SG$18 Adult Battle Box Tour. Tour guide spoke and presented information well. She discussed the Battlebox and also Fort Canning Hill, including some short video's to view. If your into WW11 history very interesting."
,,Wonderful piece of History,5.0,,"If your a interested in the history of Singapore, then the Battle Box certainly provides an insite, and it is worth doing the tour, rather than just wandering in the maze of displays. Tip for walkers, it is high on a hill, lots of steps to get to the information centre (where the tour starts) - if you don't want to walk the many steps, grab a taxi - drops you at the front entrance of the information centre. For tour timings, jump onto the web site for further details/ timings.
Highly recommended - takes about 1 to 2 hrs all up."
,,A Step back In Time,5.0,,Visited here with my wife whilst holidaying in Singapore. Nancy our tour guide was very informative and I am glad we made the effort to visit the battle box. Thanks to other people on trip advisor I took their advice and we arrived early for the first tour at 9.30 am for the 9.45am tour. The tour is well worth the S$18 and would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone traveling to Singapore. It is a history lesson well worth attending.
,,Excellent tour to understand the WW2 history of Singapore,5.0,,"Really informative, and interesting tour - the guides are highly interactive & engaging - highly recommended!"
,,Really a must see,5.0,,"There are a number of stops on this island that delve into the WWII history in Singapore...this is the best of them. Having a fantastic guide who really knew her stuff certainly helped, but the displays and the actual environs help you understand what was going on during that time and establish a sense for what it was like. Only criticism, and it is somewhat minor, is the guide and the display tend to mute to an extent those guilty of the atrocities...I suppose in an effort to make those individuals from Northern Asia feel an odd sense of pride (?). Anyway, a must see, no question."
,,Battle Box,5.0,,"Ft Canning is in the middle of ""Downtown"" Singapore. There is lots to see here besides just the Battle Box. Take half a day to see and explore the entire area. If you are a history buff, this is a must see. You have to sign up for a tour so go earlier than you think you need to. The tours fill up quickly. It's about an hour and a half to go through the Battle Box and then you can spend another two hours touring the rest of the complex on your own. Nice restaurants and facilities on the grounds. Clark Quay is just on the other side of the hill."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"We booked a guided tour with Joanne. Very interesting museum/war bunker. Would recommend to anyone who wants to know some more about the history of Singapore in WW2. I learned a lot and it was presented in an interesting way. The ""Battlebox"" is airconditioned too - just for those of you wanting to escape the heat. ;)"
,,"Battlebox - Gripping, entertaining, well paced, well priced...",5.0,,"The title of the review covers it really. Having been to many museums and similar tours across the world, I was looking forward to see whether the Battlebox tour matched the quality of previous reviews. It sure did... in spades. Well suited to those with a bit of interest in history, although I expect that most people will get caught up with the infectious enthusiasm of the presentation and captivating story. Sad to hear that in the future the tour will be ""automated"" with audio guides... so get in quick! And as for the special prize winning question at the end? Well, you will just have to go and listen carefully."
,,Interesting Piece of WWII History - Excellent Tour,5.0,,"I went on the 5th of August and was part of the first tour group in the morning with Kamaliah as our tour guide. Luckily, there were only three peoples in the group (The next group is fully book with 20+ people). The bunker itself was pretty nondescript, but the story that were told help me better understand not only how war bunker have been built and use as well as the history of Malaya-Singapore during the war. It is quite clear that the building itself wouldn't have been as interesting without a very nice presentation from our guide. I have a lovely time in the morning, learn a lot of interesting knowledge, and have a much better appreciation of Singapore role in WWII.

The building and the bunker is also air conditioned.... which even for someone who are used to heat like me is a huge plus. However, if you are travelling to Battlebox by subway, it is a bit of a walk from the nearest station."
,,Excellent tour,5.0,,Visited the Battlebox in July with my 14 year old son. Jerome was our tour guide and led us through the Battlebox during our hour long tour (which actually lasted 1 hr and 15 mins). Incredibly informative and not only brought the surrender of Singapore to life but also the wider Pacific War. Really informative and highly recommended for anyone visiting Singapore who has an interest in history and or the second world war. Cost of entry was only S$18 and the visitor centre also has a small gift shop where you can purchase relevant books etc.
,,Great experience for WW2 buffs,5.0,,Three of us attended it. it was really a great time to walk in such a historic place. The guide was knowledgeable.
,,Good guide,5.0,,The visit really makes sens with your tour guide who explains the history that was made here at the battlebox
,,Great experinece,5.0,,A fantastic experience where you might get interesting information about the fall of Singapore during the Second World! If you are a history lover then you shouldn't miss it!
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Visited the Battlebox tour on our last day in Singapore. I wanted to visit as my great uncle had been sent to Singapore in WWII just before it fell to the Japanese, but luckily survived his internment and lived into his 80s.

Anyway we picked the first tour of the day which we were pleased to have done as there were only 12 of us on it. The next one had at least 20 and spaces down there are tight.

The guide Mel was excellent and gave great insight into the events around the surrender of Singapore. Lots of pictures, a couple of short films and rooms recreated for how they would have been.

You can't take photos down there, however I guess that preserves some of the detail for the day.

An excellent tour that brings history to life and certainly makes you think.

A 5 min walk from the MRT so easy to get to too."
,,National Education on National Day,5.0,,"I had gone to an underground bunker overseas and was reluctant to pay to enter this one. But I did anyway. I was impressed by the guide who was a undergrad at the National University of Singapore. Kelysha was clear and informative. She also had a number of fun facts to share with us. I was surprised that there was a good sized crowd that participated in the tour. I thought that it was going to be creepy but the Battlebox was actually very well maintained and well lit. We explored a number of rooms, saw replicas and watched 2 short videos about the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese. Good experience."
,,A relic of the past British rule,5.0,,"This is an amazing place, an underground bunker built after WW 1 and formed a major part of the British defence of this part of the Commonwealth. The Battle Box was opened to the public in recent years after extensive repair as it had remained closed and forgotten for about sixty years before being rediscovered. A very sobering look back at the war with Japan."
,,A 'must visit' museum,5.0,,"Visited the Battlebox museum with my 18 yr old daughter. Its located in Fort Canning Park, and pretty easy to find from the numerous signs around. You'll need to book yourself on to a guided tour, which run every few hours. We got into the next available one when we arrived. Not sure how busy it gets- may need planning ahead. We just 'killed time' by going to the nearby Spice Gardens. The tour lasts 1.5 h and takes you from the gift shop into the underground allied forces HQ. There are a few video clips and a great commentary from our guide (we had Mel who was excellent). If you have any interest in the history of Singapore under British rule, and the events surrounding the fall of Singapore during WWII- then this is a must see museum. Its a moving experience."
,,Amazing insight,5.0,,Amazing time learning about Singapore's history throughout the ages. Mel was a passionate guide who made the tour unique. Highly recommend
,,Tour the Battlebox,5.0,,This was not a tour to disappoint. Mel was our leader and did an exceptional job of presenting the history of the invasion of Singapore
,,Very interesting and well-presented History,5.0,,Like most Americans (probably) I didn't know a thing about Singapore's fall in WWII and the British involvement. It was very interesting and the bunker was very well restored/maintained. My favorite part was the wax figures in the panoramas instead of some cheesy manekins. The tourguide kept it interesting and it was well worth the visit.
,,Hddden Gem to Explore,5.0,,"Came across this little tour by accident, definitely worth a visit if you like a little bit of history. Tour guide was very informative, goes for about 1 hour, well worth it, very interesting on how the British surrendered Singapore to the Japanese in 1945. Price was only $18 per person [adult] not sure what they charge for children."
,,Highly informative,5.0,,"Jerome, our guide was extremely informative. Such a humbling place. The tour last just over an hour and is well worth the visit. I'd recommend booking in advance as places are limited."
,,Battle box Revisited,5.0,,We always enjoy visiting the battle box. Love the military history of Singapore. The Battle Box has recently been redone. Cant say that it is any better but it is still a great place to visit. Its very nice to walk the grounds on and near the Battle Box. Its always peaceful and relaxing. Very underappreciated.
,,An amazing insight,5.0,,"Aysha, our highly professional caring and most respectful Battle Box guide took us back into a very dark period in British military history. She opened pages of the surrenders history not known to many.
Thank you Aysha.
The bunker is as original as possible considering the enemy occupied it post surrender.
Even Japanese 'graffiti ' has been retained on the toilet walls.
A must for anyone visiting Singapore"
,,Worthy of a Visit,5.0,,This is quite a remarkable place to visit for an insight into the fall of Singapore in 1942 - highly recommended.
,,Fantastic insight into the battle,5.0,,We took a group tour and it was very interesting. The guide was knowledgeable and able to answer questions about the general context of the war as well as the specific site. Interesting that the whole thing was effectively lost and hidden away for so many years. The site has been restored in a sensitive way.
,,Very interesting and informative tour,5.0,,"This tour is a very interesting tour, which gives you a good insight into the fall of Singapore during the Second World War. You can enter the bunker only with a tour guide and you have multiple tours a day."
,,Thought provoking and insightful,5.0,,Very interesting afternoon in Fort Canning park and at the Battlebox. Guide was very knowledgeable and the tour was excellent. Tour my be longer than one hour.
,,Informative tour,5.0,,"Great informative tour around the Battlebox, all generations of our family learning about Singapore history."
,,Interesting and informative,5.0,,"We went yesterday, didn't book ahead. We waited 20 minutes as the tours started at 11am. So check the timing. The entrance is just of the main road in the park. At this stage you have to go with a guide for 1hr 15 minutes. Our guide was very knowledgeable you didn't need to ask questions as she covered it all. It was a good pace, easy to get around, though there were a few steps to get down the bunker. We would go again and a good price."
,,Great attraction,5.0,,"Did the Battlebox tour with 2 children (10 & 8) and this kept there attention. Really well run, tour guides very informative and a fantastic pice of WW2 history. Definite 'do' for any WW2 enthusiasts!"
,,Wow,5.0,,"What a fantastic experience, well set out and explained. Provided a comprehensive and informative description of the era and site. Well worth the entry fee."
,,Fantastic Attraction,5.0,,"A brilliant attraction, made better by a fantastic guide, who clearly had both a passion for Singaporean and WW2 history, but also for storytelling also.

The guided tour takes places a number of times each day, and although having arrived 10 minutes late for the start of the tour, the gentleman at the front desk made a great effort to allow us join the tour which was appreciated. I would advise looking up tour start times!

The tour includes two videos and a walk around the bunkers / Battle Box. The guides explains the story of the people involved, and stories from each of the rooms too.

A really great visit, and at $18.00, great value too."
,,Very Informative and Moving,5.0,,"Battlebox is located in Fort Canning Park and is close to the National Museum of Singapore.

It was part of the headquarters of the British Army in Malaya who were assisted by their Indian and Australian allies and the tour is based on the events leading up to and after the surrender to the Japanese in February 1942.

It is a guided tour and you can't just visit independently, so it's best to check the website for the tour times.

Sharul the tour guide paints a picture of the mistakes that were made causing the fall of Singapore. It is very interesting and lasts for around 75 minutes.

A must for anyone who is interested in World War II history along with Changi Chapel and Museum.

The admission fee is SIN$18."
,,Excellent Tour,5.0,,My boyfriend and will completed the battlebox tour (1hour) with Mel as our tour guide. The tour was fabulous - very informative learnt a lot about the history and Mel was an excellent tour guide very enthusiastic well worth the trip would definitely recommend !!
,,Excellent and informative,5.0,,"The tour was very interesting and informative, it provided a great insight into the historical background of the bunker. It is extremely well preserved and the guide was very knowledgeable. Our family thoroughly enjoyed the tour and would highly recommend."
,,An excellent tour,5.0,,"I went with my wife and did the one hour tour of the Box with the most knowledgeable Mel as the tour guide.

It was most interesting to go down into the Bunker and see the conditions under which the men lived and operated. The heat and the humidity of the day certainly gave me a new found respect for those who fought there at the time.

Mel provided an excellent tour and background information on the Fall of Singapore. She gave me a lot of information I did not know and certainly changed my perception on the Commanding Officer of the time, General Percival.

If you are a history buff, then this is a must do tour. If you are not, I would still go as it is a most interesting location."
,,A very realistic restoration.,5.0,,"The Battlebox is an amazing restoration of the interior of this WW2 bunker.
Many of the twenty eight rooms have been returned to the way they originally looked.
Very lifelike models of the main characters involved in the final days before the surrender make the whole scenario very realistic.
Our guide was fantastic. Her knowledge of the whole Singapore battle scenario was amazing.
I would recommend this tour to anyone interested in the history of Singapore."
,,Very Interesting,5.0,,A wonderfully curated exhibit with knowledgable tour guides. The tour took a bit over an hour. The tour was filled with interesting details about how the facility was used and the war itself.
,,A moving historical Experience,5.0,,"As an amateur historian, I felt this was an excellent tour. The tour guide, Jerome, was extremely knowledgeable, gave a vivid reconstruction of Japanese invasion of Singapore , & the British response, coordinated from the Battle box bunker. The battle box itself has been very sympathetically restored, & yet there is a foreboding atmosphere underground, as if the very walls can talk . It is eerie , & moving. This museum is an understated museum, considering the historical importance it played in the fall of Singapore, & the decline of The British Empire. Well worth a visit"
,,Fascinating insight into Singapore's defence and surrender in WWII,5.0,,"My husband, myself and our two teenage sons, 16 & 18, did the 1 hr guided tour of Singapore's top secret WWII underground military operations bunker, now known as the BattleBox Museum. It is located beneath the apex of Fort Canning Park, a lovely park situated on a steep hill overlooking Clarke Quay. If you plan to visit and have difficulty walking uphill, I suggest you take a taxi to the Battlebox Visitor Centre. Our tour group consisted of about 20 visitors and our delightful and very informative tour guide Nancy. Adult tickets are $18 and good value. To enter the BattleBox, you have to descend a number of steps down into the bunker, from then on you are guided through the many underground rooms where the British commanders plotted strategy and defence against the Japanese invasion. There are very lifelike full-size models of the military commanders who made the decision to surrender to the Japanese, it is quite a poignant and sobering recreation. Nancy's highly informative and descriptive retelling of a pivotal moment in Singapore's history was fascinating and our whole family enjoyed the tour. The BattleBox Visitor Centre has a range of books, souvenirs, snacks and cold drinks for sale."
,,Knowledge for the unknowledgeable!,5.0,,"I went with my children aged 8, 19 and 21. To my great surprise everyone found the museum fascinating and interesting. The story of the fall of Singapore was told by a tour guide and it was one of the very best presentations I have heard. Totally engaging and better than a self guided visit. Highly recommend to all!"
,,Very interesting,5.0,,Really enjoyed the guided tour. Very interesting information about the lead up to the surrender of Singapore. Guide is very knowledgeable.
,,Facts of War,5.0,,"If you are interested in history and want information on what really happened when the Allies surrender to the Japanese....this is the place to go. Bit of an uphill trek to reach, we got a cab which dropped us at the front door, choose to walk back down hill. This is a real bunker and our guide was very informative and answered all our questions. A bit claustrophobic and warm as you are underground but is well lit. Found out quite a few things about the Allied forces."
,,Best tour guide!,5.0,,"This tour was really great. Learnt alot about the history of Singapore. Videos, wax figure scene reenactments. However what made this tour was Sharul the tour guide. Incredibly knowledgeable, witty and engaging. Wish he was my history teacher! He said they may go to audio tours instead of guides, this would be a travesty. Kids: 13 yr old loved it, 10 yr old ok with it. Mobility Grandma ok there are steps but generally accessible once you are up the top of fort canning. Catch a cab up if mobility is an issue. Overall really loved it."
,,A must visit attraction - even with teenage boy,5.0,,We all really enjoyed the tour and found it both interesting and informative. It left us all wanting to read more about the fall of Singapore.
,,Incredible,5.0,,"My partner & I had a tour of the Battlebox in Singapore this afternoon. I highly recommend it. It was both emotionally moving & informative. Our guide was fantastic. He is excellent in his professionalism & his knowledge of military history.
Please consider doing the tour.
I have a personal connection to the history as one of my Grandfathers was a Australian soldier on Singapore when it fell to the Japanese in WWII.
But I highly recommend any one visit the Battlebox.
Desleigh Dutton"
,,Recommended,4.0,,"If you don't know much about Singapore's involvement in WW2 then this is a highly recommended guided tour. The box is an underground bunker used by the British prior to surrender to the Japanese army in February 1942. It still maintains much of its original feel and features. Kel, the guide, was very knowledgeable. Only down side was that, I felt, you were shuffled around too quickly and weren't given enough time to read about each room."
,,"Interesting tour, history buff or not.",4.0,,"We googled things to do the night before and came across the Battlebox. I honestly wasn't looking forward to it, but hubby wanted to go. It worked out well as it was a rainy morning, so was nice to be inside.

My reservations about the tour however, were quickly forgotten. the tour was insightful and so interesting. I learned a lot about WWII that I never knew I even wanted to know. Our tour was led by a lovely woman (I believe her name was Jen). She was insightful and made learning fun.

The battlebox itself has been restored as much as possible, with the inclusion of photos and information along the walls, as well as some displays. It tells the story of the surrender of Singapore during WWII.

The only downside was, we were ushered into rooms to watch videos (which were fascinating), but not given enough time after to look at the photos and read the information in the walls.

For S$18 I recommend this tour, just be sure to have a wander around Fort Canning Park as well."
,,Why the British lost Singapore,5.0,,"This is well worth a visit. Takes you into the Bunker where the decisions were made. The tour gives you an insight into the background of the set up, the events leading upto the surrender and after effects
Who was to blame and why are answered with a few surprizes. Our guide Sharul was excellent. Children from 10+ will be kept interested."
,,Excellent guide!!,5.0,,"Overall experience was so nice. The guide was so good and sarcastic ,he explained each and everything in detail . The place is very good ,more than worth visiting."
,,Outstanding Tour for History Buffs,5.0,,"Our guide was full of knowledge and enthusiasm for this history of WWII that most folks are not familiar with. Lots of great new knowledge in a fun, relaxed tour."
,,Very interesting to hear the story of Singapore in WW2,4.0,,"We enjoyed an interesting and informative tour of the Battlrbox at Fort Canning Park. The tour was led by the delightful Jerome and was well paced and engaging. Much of the history was news to us and the exhibits, although limited in number, were sufficiently varied to keep the attention of the whole group. (We were around 25 people, aged from 8-80.) A worthwhile 1.5 hour visit and reasonable value for money."
,,Not busy,3.0,,I was the only participant in my trip and had a personal tour. Guide very good and full of information including the debunking of some of the myths
,,Too short & expensive!,2.0,,"Had been there prior to this new company taking over, hence was keen to see how it was presented, unfortunately disappointed. $18.00 for a one hour tour is far to short. What is the point in having all the displays, pictures and storyboards if you don't get time to read or view them. I felt the female guide was very clinical in her presentation, but it was awfully monotone & rushed. To do history justice, the tour should be a minimum of 2 hours."
,,Excellent tour,5.0,,Really enjoyed the tour with it's great insights into the surrender of Singapore in the Second World War. The guide was very knowledgeable and I can recommend the tour.
,,A must visit when you are in Singapore,5.0,,It is definitely a must see when you are in Singapore. A very good tour with an excellent tour guide.
,,The history here is palpable!,5.0,,"Firstly, ensure that you arrive early as limited tour spots sell out (i.e. 30 mins prior, esp weekends). I rang prior and they held us a spot. Don't bother bringing your camera, there's no photos inside. It is however air-conditioned and, despite a few steps down at the start, otherwise flat and plenty of seating available. Look at the website for tour times - less on Mondays.

The hour-long tour was excellent, very informative and interesting for all levels including those without any prior knowledge of the war in the Pacific. My 8 yr old son enjoyed it and the tour brought home for him how close invasion was to Australian shores. Our guide spoke clearly and was very knowledgeable. She answered questions on a range of issues easily, but was very unassuming.

Free wifi is helpful for hailing an Uber at the end (hard to get a cab) or browsing prior to the tour beginning."
,,Fascinating Historical Tour,5.0,,"I attended the 9:45 tour which lasted about an hour. The guide was tremendously knowledgeable and entertaining. The tour involved walking around the underground complex and viewing 3 short movies on the use of the complex, the surrender and the aftermath. It is an absolute must for all history buffs!"
,,Fascinating history of Singapore,5.0,,"This is the underground bunker for the British Army during WWII. It is restored as much as possible. The tour is led by very knowledgeable guides. Before of after the tour, Ft Canning Park is a nice place to walk if it is not too hot.
No pictures are allowed inside. Just a few stairs, easy walk for almost anyone."
,,Great tour of the bunkers at Fort Canning,4.0,,"We took a 2.5hour tour with our guide Wina whom showed us around Fort Canning and the Battlebox museum. If you are interested in Singapores history and what happened just prior to Singspores occupation of the Japanese during WWII, then this is the tour for you. Very very interesting. Great tour guide."
,,An interesting place of historical significance but could be done better,3.0,,"This site has enormous historical significance. The tour itself allows you access to the bunker and you get a guided tour with three short videos to watch. There are broken animatronics around to represent significant characters.
I thought it was a bit superficial. If you're a history buff, maybe give it a miss. This is probably good for families. There is no concern about physical access for those with mobility problems, you can drive almost to the door and there are only small steps in the bunker - no tight spaces or ladders or steep stairs to climb.
Not the best example of this type of site, but not a complete waste of time either. A solid three stars."
,,What a surprise - highly recommended,5.0,,"We very nearly didn't go. After a wonderful walk up the hill through Canning Park we arrived to find we needed to wait, and that the tour was longer than anticipated. We looked at each other, both thinking we'd be bored - we couldn't imagine how this could or should be more than 30 minutes at most. How wrong we were.
The Battlebox Tour isn't really about the rooms there, although they're fascinating of course. The Tour is about telling a story, the fall of Singapore, something we thought we knew but found we didn't.
It's told wonderfully well, focusing on the human side, not the logistics of war.
Highly highly recommended."
,,Best historical tour and great value for money.,5.0,,"I'm a history buff. This place ticked all boxes: amazing history, well informed guides, period decoration and mock ups. Ok for mid teen kids and upwards. Younger ones will get bored. I cannot fault this and highly recommend this for anyone that wants to get a true sense of the fall
Of Singapore to the invading Japanese army and the tension that existed between the British commanders. Best ever. Make sure you line up your tour times and reserve ahead."
,,Battlebox guided tour,5.0,,The guided tour of the Battlebox in Singapore was very interesting and informative. The guide was excellent.
,,"Very informative staff, detailing Singapore history during the war",5.0,,"Really worth paying the admission fee and going here for their Battlebox tour. Check their website for tour times before you go, because they do have specific times that you need to be there for. The lady who showed us around the Battlebox and told us the history of Singapore during the war and the surrender and it's consequences was incredibly informative, I think we could've asked her any question and she would've known the answer. I am British, and the British don't come off well by their actions surrendering Singapore during the war, but it was so interesting to hear what happened and the learn about the difficult decisions that had to be made. I very much enjoyed my visit and learned lots."
,,Very emotional tour,5.0,,"This tour takes you to where the decision was made to surrender Singapore to the Japanese. You are given facts, stories and explanations as to why surrender was the only option and what that meant to everyone involved. You finish with an authentic film of Percival negotiating the surrender. Highly recommended."
,,Historic and very interesting,5.0,,"We visited here many years ago when you could walk around yourself, now you have to book and join a guided tour; which is much better. Our guide (a young lady) was very knowledgeable and entertaining. The tour now includes video material and lots of interesting information, definitely worth a visit."
,,Amazing look back in history,5.0,,Wow what an amazing place. The way the place has been restored is tribute to the work they have put in. The tour guide was very knowledgable and toom time to answer any questions. If you enjoy modern history this is a must in Singapore.
,,Special part of history - very interesting,5.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a wonderful park, nice and cooling on a hot day. The highlight of our visit here would have to be the tour of the Battlebox, the old English command bunker where the decision to surrender was made. Or tour guide Aysha was excellent with a good knowledge of the bunker and the history that unfolded here. Very interesting tour where we agin learnt a lot more about the history of Singapore. The tour took 1 hour 20 minutes and was worth every dollar we paid. Highly recommend attraction, a definite must do for anyone interested in history"
,,Brilliant tour!,5.0,,"Today was our final day in Singapore and we decided to do this having seen there was a tour coming up and it would only take an hour. We caught an Uber over from Chinatown and joined our tour with Aisha (the tickets strangely stated it would be a 'Jerome' but we got Aisha). It was brilliant. It lasted a good 1.5 hours, in fact, and Aisha was confident, charismatic and informative. I feel I know a lot more about the circumstances of the surrender now, as well as more about the early history of the country, also. I would most definitely recommend a trip here for anyone in Singapore - even if only here for a few days. So interesting and probably one of the best things we did."
,,One of the best military museums I've been to,5.0,,"Firstly, we only stumbled upon this place because we decided to take a walk through Fort Canning. Looked really interesting so we decided to come back to next day to do the tour. You can't go here on you own, and have to fit in with pre-scheduled tours, but it is worth it. We were guided by the impeccably dressed Jerome who was an absolute fountain of knowledge. Such an impressive young bloke and kept us all very interested which is a fair effort for an hour with a group of 25 people. We had 4 adults and 5 kids (2yo - 9yo) but important to note you can't touch anything and kids need to behave. No strollers allowed either.
The history is amazing and the layout of the site is incredible with the fit out. Good videos on display at different stages so you can have a seat/break. I would highly recommend this for anyone with the slightest interest in the history of Singapore, Britain and Australia. So much to learn. No where really to eat around here so eat before or after down at Robertson Quay."
,,Deserves its 5-star rating,5.0,,"Easily one of the best museums in Singapore. The Battlebox is a fascinating step back in time to Singapore's darkest day. The guided tour is detailed and interesting, and brings the fall of Singapore to life. It's terrible to think how crowded and smoky the bunker must have been in 1942, with hundreds of nervous men bustling about. It is also astonishing to learn the bunker remained forgotten between the end of WW2 and 1988, only to be found by the first reporter who discovered it behind the first door he opened! Even our kids (aged 12 and 9) agreed it was one of their highlights in Singapore."
,,Spontaneous visit,5.0,,Would highly recommend this as an interesting account of singapore's place in WW1. I was not planning to be as engaged and thought Jerome was a fantastic guide! You won't regret this short detour!
,,If you enjoy history...,4.0,,This is a great tour (we had Nancy) about the bunker and what happened to the British here durning WWII. Very informative!
,,Unmissable for the history nerd.,4.0,,Churchill commanded the Singapore garrison to fight to the last man and to disregard civilian casualties. A guided tour of the Battle Box offers insights into the diabolical choices available to the abandoned commanders of the Singapore garrison in 1942.
,,war history,4.0,,welcome to some war history and some interesting insights to world war 2 and the japanese occupation in singapore. a must go for anyone wanting to be schooled in a vital element of singapore's history.
,,Great tour and wonderful Guide from Kel,4.0,,"I love history, when I visit certain places, I always look for museum or any historical places that they have. I've always want to visit Battlebox, and finally I did it on my previous visit to Singapore 27 June. Battlebox is part of the Fort Canning complex, it is closer if you enter the park from Fort Canning Road next to Singapore Museum, compare to River Valley Road. They only provide guided tour and it cost $18 per person. We learn a lot about the battle of Singapore and about the surrender itself. Beside the battlebox itself I would recommend you to spend time to walk around the park itself to have the overall perspective of the Fort.

Thumbs up for Kel our Guide."
,,An engaging account of the fall of Singapore,5.0,,"We visited the Battlebox as a last minute addition on our final day in Singapore, and we were very glad we did. If you get the chance don't pass up the opportunity to learn about the events leading up to the largest surrender of British led forces in history at the actual location where the decision was made.

Our 12 and 14 year old children were both very engaged in the story delivered by our tour guide Joanne, who clearly knows her material and provided great insight into the emotions of the key players on both sides of the war.

A must do tour for any Australian who wants to learn more about our involvement in this key early battle in the Pacific theatre."
,,An excellent tour,5.0,,"We took this tour after reading the other reviews on trip advisor. The tour was fascinating and our guide Joanne was an excellent story teller, recounting how Singapore was surrendered to the Japanese in WW2. I enjoyed every minute and would highly recommend this tour."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"This guided tour is a detailed and well set-out explanation of the events leading up to the surrender of Singapore during World War II. I had no idea of the actual detail behind the surrender so it was really good to learn the true story and to be in the rooms where the action took place. The dioramas/life-like figures add a lot to the atmosphere, and our guide was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable."
,,Outstanding tour,5.0,,This was one of the best guided tours we have done ... maybe because we had such a knowledgeable and engaging guide who did a wonderful job sharing the history and stories behind this hidden treasure. Another step back into time where the story of the Japanese invasion and surrender of Singapore is told ... excellent displays and audiovisuals which is credit to the organisers.
,,A peice of WWII history- a story of surrender,5.0,,"A good tour is all about having a good tour guide- our tour guide, Kamaliah, was the best!! It also helps to have a good location, (Fort canning is easy to get to by taxi or MRT) , there were interesting artifacts & materials to see and of course she had a good story to tell. Although Our 1 1/2 hour tour ended up being closer to 2 hours, that was okay by us. We were so engaged, we didn't even notice that we went over the initial time limit. We found the battlbox experience to be very interesting & well worth our time. After the tour we walked around the grounds. All in all it was a great place to spend the mid-morning & early afternoon. We highly recommend this tour for anyone interested in a little history. $18 a person seems like a small price to pay for such a well organized & interesting tour. We would have loved to take the extended tour but sadly for us, that one only happens during the week."
,,An excellent insight into Singapores darkest days,5.0,,"An excellent, very interesting well-presented and conducted tour by an incredibly informed guide of the British and Allied Forces Command Bunker under Fort Canning Hill where the defense of the Malay Peninsular and Singapore was orchestrated and eventually the inevitable decision to surrender to the invading Japanese was taken by the 12 most senior officers in command – a harrowing story of mistakes and shortfalls by the High Command in London which led to the Island being totally defenseless against a far superior force – a relatively new presentation and well worth adding to you itinerary – cost S$18 pp – inquire about tour times before you go and book early - takes up to 2 hours depending on numbers in the group"
,,Great Insight and an excellent guide !,5.0,,The knowledge and excellent delivery of the stories and information by our guide Shar enhanced the already nostalgic feeling of being in the actual bunkers where these historical events took place...A must do for anyone visitng Singapore with a follow up to the Changi chapel also a must....
,,Sensational Tour,5.0,,"Wow, what an informative and interesting tour through the British Command bunker in WW2. Our guide Jerome was very knowledgeable and had a great presentation style. Highly recommend this Tour for everyone."
,,"""1 hour"" tour nearly 2 hours",3.0,,"Overall this was great. It was historical and educational. It was interesting. Our tour guide was knowledgeable & entertaining. It was great to see the bunker. I wish I could give it five stars...

But our one hour tour lasted over an hour & forty-five minutes. It was so frustrating. We picked the one hour tour for a reason (longer tours are available). Our tour guide should have kept things moving to stick with the schedule but she just kept talking & talking (she was very good though)."
,,Must-do!,5.0,,"A most interesting tour, giving insight into the strategies of WW2 in Asia and the British situation in Singapore. Excellent storytelling and historical expertise by our guide Jerome!"
,,Excellent tour,5.0,,I usually don't remember much when I listen to the history of the building or monument. However this tour got my attention and interest to listen all the way. It was a well conducted tour in an air conditioned underground showrooms. Our guide was 'Shar' and he was a great tour guide.
,,Very informative & well worth $18,5.0,,"Tour guide Jerome delivered fabulous, informative and easy to understand over view of Second World War in this area. I'm not a war buff or enjoy war movies but this tour was very interesting and worth the 1 hour and $18."
,,Great tour,5.0,,"Maybe add some weapons in from both sides. Also think the tour skipped one of the rooms, maybe cause the whole group would not fit in."
,,Highlight of my trip,5.0,,"This was the highlight of my Singapore trip, Jerome was extremely knowledgeable and easy to listed to. Thank you and highly recommend."
,,Great insight into a dark period of Singapore's history.,5.0,,"The Battlebox tour is a guided walk through the underground HQ of the British Malay command as it was at the start of 1942. Restored in places, the Battlebox tales you through the history of Fort Canning and the lead up to the decision to surrender to the Imperial Japanese forces on 15 Feb 42. Our guide, Kamaliah, was great giving life to the facts as we moved through the facility. Well worth the time if you have an interest in Singapore's recent history."
,,Unmissable,5.0,,"Insufficient superlatives to describe this unique and amazing experience. Simple yet brilliant, with outstanding guides (thank you Ms. Kamilliah) who bring history to life and dramatically share the inevitable sequence of events which led to the worst defeat in British military history, downplayed then and since for propaganda reasons. Awe inspiring to stand in the room where the fate of so many soldiers and civilians was decided and the course of WW2 determined. DO NOT MISS THIS!"
,,Very educational,5.0,,This was a very interesting experience going into the Battle Box where the decision to surrender to the Japanese was made by the British. We learnt so much about the surrender of Singapore and what went on before and after. Great history lesson. We can imagine it being even better in the future as they continue to develop the site. So glad we went.
,,Interesting & Informative Tour Session,5.0,,This is my first first time at Battlebox and I've gotta to say that I'm impressed with the tour conducted. We got Jerome and he was a fantastic guide! I've learnt so much about the history of Singapore and I enjoyed the fact on how much I've learnt about the Surrender of the British during that time. It was also cool seeing the bunker and learning the dynamics that went into the decision that led to the surrender. I would definitely recommend the Battlebox tour as it's definitely worth your time even if you are not a history buff.
,,Learnt so much interesting history!,5.0,,It was worth every cent on this guided tour of the Battlebox. We did the 9.45 tour and was a nice small group and our guide was excellent. Everything was clearly explained and included some real video footage to support the history. My only comment would be that as you move fairly quickly in each room there is no time to stop and ready all the information and would be nice if a little longer was allowed to do this. I learnt so much about the history of the fall of Singapore and the part that many nations played and some of the very difficult choices and decisions that had to be made. Worth putting this on your to do list in Singapore.
,,A must see to know more about the downfall of the British,5.0,,There are many historical sites in Singapore regarding WW2 and the Japanese Occupation. The Battlebox tells of the last few days of the British High Command and the decisions they needed to make. There was a detailed explanation of the constraints they faced and the disagreements they had. A riveting account that gives a good overview.
,,Do this in Singapore,5.0,,If you are keen to learn about Singapore and what occurred in WW2 in terms of the surrender to the Japanese then this tour is a must do. It is really quite amazing the underground fortress that it is and you can really imagine what it must have been like working there just prior to the surrender. We had a wonderful tour guide in Nancy. A fantastic tour which I highly recommend
,,Very interesting and a very good guide,5.0,,"The battlebox was the Allied commands centre during world war II. It is worth a visit, you'll learn a lot what happened during the last days before the British capitulation. We had Anu as our guide - the 90 minutes were just flying by, so interesting and lively was here tour."
,,A must for a visitor to Singapore,5.0,,"The most enlightening tour of Singapore's ww11 history. Jerome, the tour guide, was brilliant. Just fascinating and thought provoking. A must do!"
,,History made real,5.0,,"We visited the Battlebox and throughly enjoyed the experience. Admission is only by guided tour now as the administration was recently taken over by Singapore History Consultants. Previously there was a self guided audio tour, not any more. We went on a Sunday 11am tour. It is a good idea to get there about my least 20 mins prior as they do limit the numbers. Our guide ""Joanne "" was very knowledgeable and succinctly told the story of the unconditional surrender of Singapore to the Japanese in WW2. The tour took about 90mins through the rooms in the Battlebox. Some rooms had some very lifelike wax figures. Throughly recommend this tour to anyone with an interest in history of WW2. You won't be disappointed. I would suggest that you check the website regarding the tour times."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"We have been travelling around S.E Asia for 6 weeks and this is probably the best tour we have been on. We took our 2 yr old and 4 yr old with us. The guy at reception seemed a bit worried about them being noisy but fortunately they kept quiet! The tour guide was extremely well informed, engaging and friendly.

I have never reviewed anything on trip advisor but I decided to make this my first review as the tour was so good."
,,a different but must go place,5.0,,if you want to know about the singapore history this is the best place. a well education guide who took us for a behind the scenes of ww2. we hardly know about the history of singapore but now it changed thanks to this place.
,,A must for the history buff!,5.0,,"If you're a history buff, especially if you're a World War II fan, this is a must-do! The guides are excellent and will allow you to almost viscerally experience what happened during the Fall of Singapore in Feb 1942."
,,Awakening,5.0,,A very educational and informative tour conducted under ground in the original bunker (air conditioned). Guide was excellent and use of some original news reel footage added authenticity to the whole presentation. Relatively cheap and excellent value for money.money.
,,Fascinating account of the British getting it badly wrong.,4.0,,Our guide had an encyclopaedic knowledge of the event which resulted in the biggest surrender of the British armed forces in history. He went through the detail and it was fascinating to get behind the facts and see the level of infighting that went on. This is a must see tour and was one of the highlights of my visit to this great Island.
,,Very nice journey into Singapore history in war,5.0,,"With a guide, one can get a in-depth walk into the journey of Singapore war history in a very comfortable air conditioned environment."
,,Highly recommended history tour in Singapore,5.0,,"Even as a local, who have visited SG museums and joined a few historical tours in Singapore, I would still rate this battlebox tour as the most engaging, touching and in-depth. Our guide Anu, is professional and knowledgeable. My friend and I left the battlebox in a pensive mood, this shows how engaging the entire experience was. With real video footage and walking around the bunk with traces of Japanese occupying the place made the experience extremely real. You can only enter the bunks if you join the tour, which only cost SGD18, much lesser than some other history tours in Singapore. If you only have a few days in SG, and want to know more about what happened in Singapore in WW2, this is the tour to join."
,,Battlebox tour,5.0,,"We took a four year old who was bored and a six year old who loved it. All four adults who went thoroughly enjoyed it. The guide was brilliant, he knew his stuff and encouraged everyone in the group to participate. He even gave a prize at the end for the first person to answer a question about the fall of Singapore. I would encourage anyone who has an interest in history to do this tour."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"If you are interested in war history then this is definately worth the trip. Small groups taken into the bunker and original film clips, photos and the guide tell the story. Most of the original bunker items were looted before the British returned after the war but every effort has been made to recreate the atmosphere of the bunker with replicas and lifesize wax figures. Even noticed that some children of the 10-12 age group in our visit who appeared disinterested at first, quickly became engaged."
,,Holiday,5.0,,Very good. I knew my history but the guide and venue increased it. Very well presented and at the right level for all. This should be a must for every tourist.
,,Battlebox,5.0,,"A must-visit place if you want to know something about the events that led up to and includes the Japanese invasion of Singapore in 1942. Our guide, Joanne, was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Well worth the SD18 ticket price."
,,Absolutely amazing tour and staff,5.0,,We attended the tour this morning with Joanne as our tour guide. She was extremely knowledgeable and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Both my partner and I love learning about history and this tour met all our expectations. A must do whilst in Singapore
,,A touch of History in Busy Singapore,4.0,,"It was a nice 1 hour guided tour of the WW2 bunkers, with an informative and friendly guide. The only downside was that it would have been nice to have a bit of ""free time"" in the bunkers to read and view a bit more."
,,Very intriging,5.0,,For the history buffs I reccomend this. Our tour guide was very good and the history behind this was astonishing.
,,THE NO. 1 MUSEUM TOUR IN SINGAPORE,5.0,,"The best tour in Singapore with a fascinating tale to tell. S$18 gets you a look inside the actual bunker where the British made the decision to surrender to Japan on 15th February 1942. [ I found out it was the same day that the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour.] Our tour leader was brilliant. He was a well informed young Singaporean man who had recently served in the Singapore Army. He was a real font of knowledge. The Battlebox is a different kind of museum that explains the true causes behind “the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history”. The tour guide was brilliant but you should go soon as we were told that the guides are about to be replaced by the inferior 'recorded, self guided tours'. It won't be as good as hearing it from a local.
When you look on the map BattleBoxt looks a bit difficult to reach by public transport but it is just stones throw from Orchard Road. Get off at Dhoby Ghaut MRT station and walk up a steep hill through a lovely park and you are there.There are fair few steps but its worth it!"
,,"Poignant, exceptional tour.",5.0,,"I'm quite interested in military history and have visited a fair number of European, North American, Mediterranean, African, and Middle Eastern battle sites, memorials and museums - US Independence, 1812, US Civil War, English Civil War, Scottish struggles, Peninsular War, WW1, WW2, and more recent wars.
The Battle Box in Fort Canning Park is one of the most fascinating, professional, and poignant guided tours I have ever been on. Do not visit Singapore without seeing it. I was nearly in tears by the end.
Our guide Shural was ex-Singapore military, obviously enormously professionally and personally invested in telling the strategic story of Singapore's fall through the physical artifacts to hand in the Battlebox. He succeeded magnificently. A beautiful balance of detail and wider significance, setting Singapore's tragedy in the context of the second half of the war, unpacking the personal turmoil of the military commanders while describing the physical conditions of the bunker itself. This is what military history needs to be - so that our children, and their children, do not forget.
Thank you Shural. You made my return to Singapore after 50 years even more poignant than I had imagined it would be."
,,Battlebox,5.0,,"A bit off the beaten track, but worth a visit. It takes about 1 hour for the conducted tour of the bunker which was the control point for the allies in Singapore, and from where the decision was made to surrender Singapore to the Japanese. A serious bit of history"
,,Fantastic glimpse into the past,5.0,,The decisions that were made in this bunker in 1942 shaped the world as we know it today. Was fantastic to see it brought to life with waxwork recreations of the war room including Gen. Percival himself. Our guide 'Shar' was exceptionally knowledgeable and had a real enthusiasm for the place and it's important role in the history of Singapore. Cannot recommend this enough for history enthusiasts!
,,Essential for WWII fans,5.0,,"Loved the ""private"" tour of this place. Takes about an hour and you get deep history of the british in singapore leading up to and during WWII. Seems like the British were either incompetent, arrogant or just plain stupid as they (and Ford motor) ended up building the roads in Malaysa that ultimately led to their swift demise. Great history of the central figures and the decision making that led to the surrender."
,,Simple bunker with historic value,3.0,,"The historical value is the main point in this bunker, as it was the base used by the british, when the decision to give up Singapore was taken. It is hard to understand why they prohibit taking photos down, thats one point minus from me."
,,Very Interesting guided tour,5.0,,Very significant historical location. Expert guided tour is required. You can't wander alone in the battle box. The recreation of the rooms are very realistic with manikins of real historical figures on the level of wax museum.
,,battlebox,5.0,,"Visited with kids to help with history of WW2, well worth it. Guide was very informative and tour wasn't rushed at all. Highly recommend"
,,Our first visit to The Battle Box and Fort Canning,5.0,,"This was a long overdue visit to the Battle Box which I never had time for on my previous visits to Singapore and I must say it was well worth the visit. The staff at the visitors centre were extremely friendly and informative. Our guide was very good and gave us an informative and entertaining appreciation of the events leading up to the Japanese invasion of Malaya and what was then part of Malaya, Singapore. I think it is a must see for all Australian and British travellers."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Very good guided tour. A very informative piece of Singapore's WWII history and background as to why things occurred.
,,Story of Most Infamous British Military Surrender,4.0,,"Very informative tour with interesting site models of those involved in the struggle and eventual surrender of the British army in Singapore. Our tour guide Jerome was very well-versed and prepared in his tour plus adding the dramatic flair when necessary.

A bit difficult to reach by public transit or walking due to its positioning on the top of the hill."
,,Must See,5.0,,The Battle Box is a must see. It is in an original ww2 bunker. The guide is excellent and very knowledgeable . It is about the fall out regai ing of Singapore in ww2.
,,Eye opening!,5.0,,"To me this is a must if visiting Singapore. A Fantastic experience in the former underground British Army Command Centre located in the middle of the beautiful Canning Fort Park.
An excellent tour which takes around an hour with an enthusiastic and highly knowledgable guide. Through the guide and videos it brings to life the days leading to the Japanese invasion of Singapore and the tragedy of the occupation."
,,A must see visit to Battlebox history that's real,5.0,,"My Battlebox tour was amazing great value for money. Our guide Shurla was so knowledgeable and enthusiastic. He made history so interesting, answered questions this is a must see tour for anyone interested in Singapore's history during WW2. So much detail and film footage, Sharla explained in great detail the problems faced by the British Command and the shortages that they endured including water for the thousands of people stuck on the island. I highly recommend this tour."
,,Amazingly interesting tour,5.0,,If you'd have told me I would be fascinated for over 90 minutes with details of Singapore's involvement in WWII I would have laughed! The tour kept me and my sons (12 & 14) completely engaged the for the entire time. The tour guide (Shar) was so well informed and with a family involvement in the war he showed passion and personal interest in the information he provided. Highly recommend this tour while you're in SIngapore.
,,Great tour,5.0,,"Great guided tour in WW2, and how Singapore was involved. Guide was very knowledgeable, museum was of good quality. A must do if you are in Singapore and are interested in history."
,,"When visiting Singapore, make time for The Battlebox Tour!",5.0,,"My wife and I enjoyed a great tour of Battlebox this afternoon by Jerome and I would highly recommend this experience to those with any interest in Singapore, British, Military and/or WWII history.

The Singapore History Consultants have done a wonderful job of restoring the bunker and via the guide, videos, photos, life sized wax figures of key personnel, etc. they provide a great history lesson of the British & Japanese strategies and ultimately the British surrender of ""Fortress Singapore"" or what Churchill called the ""worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history.""

Depending on the day ""The Battlebox Tour"" is given 3-5 times, lasts about 75 minutes and cost $18 SDG per person at the visitors center. We were able to make a reservation in advance via a phone call."
,,A must see for those interested in Singapore's WW2 history,5.0,,Our tour lasted 90 minutes and was packed with fascinating detail. The tunnels are reached by steps down and laid out much as they were. It was easy to imagine how dreadful those day days leading to surrender were
,,Wow! Great piece of history!,4.0,,"Very educational and informative. Tour guide was great! Would have given 5 stars, as I think the tour groups should be a bit smaller, and allow more time to read the information posted on the walls. Overall, awesome tour and would definitely recommend!"
,,FASCINATING TOUR OF BATTLEBOX UNDERGROUND BUNKER,5.0,,"We took this tour on the advice of friends are thought it really excellent. Our guide was knowledgable and managed to keep the whole tour group engaged even though the age difference was considerable including some young children. The bunker has been carefully restored recently in a most authentic manner and our guide gave the history of the bunker in an engaging way with some excellent short videos. It is not possible to visit the bunker without taking the tour, but for anyone interested in the history of Singapore during the second world war, the tour is a must and not expensive. I would recommend calling the visitor centre to pre book. The surrounding gardens at Fort Channing are a beautiful oasis in the city and well worth a visit in their own right."
,,A real eye opener.,5.0,,"My own view is that those who declare war should be on the front line. This place could have been just a series of abandoned tunnels if not bought to life by the likes of Gerome ( our tour guide and local historian ). Next time you are in Singapore, make sure you take the tour. Just book on line and pay before the tour. Get there a tad earlier and treat yourself to breakfast at the Fort Channing Hotel.
Don't eat too much or your stomach might churn when you discover what passed for military intelligence in WW2 and why Singapore was left so poorly defended."
,,An excellent guided tour of this historic place,5.0,,The guided tour was excellent (all visits are by guided tour). Our guide was very well informed and engaging and provided an excellent insight into the Battle for Singapore and the surrender in 1942. Visiting the place where it happened was very interesting indeed.
,,History lover's place,5.0,,"Battle box was one of the few things we had not seen in Singapore. It was great! We had booked a tour and the guide (Jerome?) was excellent. He knew so much and the whole story was told in a logical way so everyone understood. Very well set up, organised and explained! Of course you must like a bit of history and interested in this sort of war history sites, but well worth the money and 1 1/2 hour of the day. A great experience."
,,Very informative guided tour,5.0,,We didn't book in advance and arrived about an hour before the start of the 1.30 tour. We were lucky to get tickets as they only take a maximum of about 25 to 30 on each tour. The guide took us into the underground complex of rooms which were used by the Allies during WW2. Many rooms are set up as they would have been during the war and a couple of videos were shown. In all it took about 1.5 hours. It was very informative and if you're interested in the history of Singapore during the war it is a must see. I recommend you buy your tickets in advance. If you have the opportunity take time to wander around the Fort Canning gardens which are very well maintained.
,,History brought to life,4.0,,Great tour leader helps to put one inside the turbulent times of WWII. Learned much about the battles and decisions during Japanese invasion.
,,great tour - self guided,5.0,,"This was really interesting,im not into the war as my husband is but this was interesting, recommend to BOOK to see bunker as this is the highlight,close to quays easy walk back"
,,A definite must do,5.0,,"The last time we visited Singapore this venue was closed for renovation so it was top of the list this time round and we were not disappointed. The restoration has been completed to a high order preserving its history yet providing an extremely interesting tour. Our guide,Kamaliah, certainly knew the history of the Battlebox. She was a wealth of knowledge and also managed to provide some lighter moments,not easy when dealing with such a serious and disastrous episode in military history.
The main military characters are portrayed by wax like figures so realistic you expect them to start talking at any moment. There is obviously a great deal of sadness about the Battlebox none more so than when a newsreel is shown of the actual surrender to the Japanese and its immediate aftermath. Even if you are not an avid history fan you will still be enthralled as the story unfolds so make a point of visiting the Battlebox."
,,A first class tour,5.0,,"The guided tour around the battle box was a superb insight into the fall of Singapore and real value for money
The tour guide was extremely informative and enthusiastic about the subject.
We had visted the River Kwai and war graves earlier in our holiday whilst in Bangkok and this tour really helped to piece together the course of events
Would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore"
,,Military History buffs....don't miss this tour.,5.0,,"Nestled in Fort Canning on Talbot Hill....this amazing piece of history rediscovered.
You get a good guided tour with a potted history of the events leading up to the sad surrender of Singapore in 42.
One can feel the experience room to room.

A very well hosted tour. Book early as sells out."
,,a war history so close,5.0,,A tribute visit to British troops that heroically underwent the harsh invasion of Singapore Island in 1942. Finally Percival had his revenge in 1945 ! Jerome is an outstanding and guide with much humor.
,,Interesting tour,5.0,,"I finally got into the Battlebox! I swear I've climbed up the hill in Fort Canning Park on all three of my previous visits to Singapore, and it's always been closed for restoration or some other reason.

You can only enter on a tour and according to their website you don't need to book in advance, but when I arrived at 1pm the 1.30pm tour was already full. This may just be because it was a public holiday, though. There were still tickets for the 2.45pm tour but I decided to come back for the 4pm session.

(If you do find yourself with time to kill, the National Museum is really close by. If you don't feel you have time for that, there are several other museums in the area, including the little Philatelic Museum. It always has interesting temporary exhibitions on - it was decorated eggs and Harry Potter last weekend - and isn't just for stamp lovers!)

This isn't a flashy, high-tech place to visit, and most of the objects on display are replicas because everything was looted. However, the docents give very detailed tours and explain the progression of events very well. The tour took about an hour and a half and makes a good companion to a visit to the Changi Museum."
,,Very informative and interesting tour,5.0,,Our guide was Shar and he was really good at presenting the history and flow of the tour. The flow of the tour was great and was informative. Must do museum tour.
,,A very educational visit with great insight gained.,4.0,,"This underground 'attraction' in Fort Canning park was well worth visiting albiet a little hard to locate in the Park as the signage was found a bit misleading.That said it truly was fascinating to hear and experience the history associated with it. It is set up in a very authentic way and the guide really brought the Battlebox to life with facts/stories/details that were both inspiring and mindboggling.You could only visit on a guided tour but it was good value. One person on my tour felt claustrophobic but this, in my opinion, was what it really would have been like and added to the realism of it all. An added bonus of the visit was that being underground made it a natural respite from the heat. If you decide not to do the tour there is a booking/general office that does have good information available in the form of booklets etc."
,,Great History Lesson,5.0,,"We recently completed this tour after reading the reviews. The tour lasted approx 1 1/2 hours and our guide was Mel. Mel is full of knowledge and a delight to listen to. It is good to listen to how things happened at this time and what led up to the surrender. At the moment entry is only by guided tour for $18SGD, but we believe it is value for money. If you wish to visit ensure you know the times and book, we noticed today one of the tours was booked out.Also if using Dhoby Ghaut MRT exit B, the notices say head towards Park Mall,this mall has gone it is currently a building site, but there are directions on the construction fence beside Penang Highway across from the bus station crossing.
Definitely worth a visit."
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,"We stumbled across this great tour whilst walking through the beautiful Canning Park. The tour lasts approximately 90 minutes, providing an overview of the role that the bunker played in the surrender of Singapore during World War Two. Our tour guide was fantastic, very enthusiastic and able to answer our questions. Thoroughly recommend."
,,A history lesson on the fall of Singapore,5.0,,We signed up for a 1hr tour. Ended up being 2hrs with information and video footage from the time. Our guide Anu was excellent and made it easy to see what it was like underground. The figures are very lifelike. Well worth it but probably not much interest for the very young. Pity we couldn't take pictures inside. A great way to learn what happened.
,,Fascinating; Probably the best tour guide of any attraction ever!,5.0,,"An absolute gem of an attraction in Singapore looking at one of the most crucial events in the city states history. Our guide Eisen, a young, knowledgable and infectiously enthusiastic historian brought the entire bunker to life, adding vast swathes of knowledge way outside his remit as a guide. He answered all questions we as a group had that covered all of Singapores history, not just that of the Second World War, all adding to the attractiveness of this brilliant contrast to the high rise modern Singapore. I leant more here in 30 minutes with Eisen than the rest of the 3 weeks I spent in Singapore put together. DO NOT MISS"
,,So informative,5.0,,"We have travelled to Singapore over 30 years with 10 visits, and we have never done this tour before. It is very informative and I found it easy to understand the fall of singapore as they put it into chronologicial order. Everyone should do this!!!"
,,Fascinating tour,5.0,,"A fascinating tour. Our group of four was led by the very knowledgable and personable Jerome. Using a combination of film, photos, wax figures and being in the bunker itself, we were lead through the events involving Singapore during WWII. I would recommend this tour to everyone!"
,,Do not miss visiting the Battlebox,5.0,,"This is where the British decided to surrender Singapore to the Japanese in 1942 during the 2nd World War. You will see and be told of how Singapore fell, and what happened to the people of Singapore and the British servicemen. A very bad and tearful story"
,,Bravery at Battle Box,5.0,,"If you want to learn about the early events of the Second World War in Singapore and Malaysia, I recommend the Battle Box attraction. The guided tour takes you to the significant events from the start of the war until Singapore surrenders to the invading forces, which is roughly 2 months apart.

The tour is held right inside the underground command center where the Malaya Command monitored and directed the war efforts of the British, Australian, Indian, Singaporean and Malayan troops.
The command center is a bombproof bunker, previously not accessible by the public, which adds to the mystery surrounding the Battle Box.

The tour tells the story of how this command center functioned during the war. With a combination of walking tour (of different rooms with wax figures, mock up, photos, maps, diagrams), tour guide explanation and videos, you will definitely understand and somehow visualize much of the struggles that went on during that dark phase in Singapore history.

Price is not at all high for this type of tour - very engaging indeed. It's value for money. Plus, it was a huge help to be guided by a knowledgeable person - perfect know-how and delivery of explanation. She also made it interactive by asking questions and patiently waiting for replies from the tour participants. I learned much from the 1.5-hour tour; my time wasn't wasted.

No wonder this is a top-rated museum in Singapore. I suggest that you book in advance as the slots get filled quickly."
,,Interesting and informative tour,5.0,,"A great guided tour, with an informative and knowledgeable guide. Luckily our group was only 6, so that made it even better. Of interest to people of all ages, except the under 5's, and suitable for school age children. Good value for money. We did not pre-book, but did turn up for the first tour of the day. May need to book in popular school and holiday times."
,,Battle Box,5.0,,"Closed on my last visit... so this review is based on a previous visit... this is where the stupid Lt Gen Percival... foolishly tried to defend the Island against the Japanese... not helped by the cowardly behaviour of Gordon Bennett the Australian General who was rightfully shunned for deserting his troops, the only decent leader was the CO of the Argylls who was extricated against his will because of his prowess in Jungle warfare... the whole charade was a disgrace to arms...Our most shameful moment."
,,Great guide,5.0,,"We did the ""strategy and surrender"" tour which took an hour and a half, half an hour longer than was advertised but, it was really interesting and Jerome (the guide) was extremely knowledgeable and captivating. Great attraction and value for money, very interesting."
,,Outstanding tour suitable for all,5.0,,"We joined a guided tour here and spent 75 mins exploring the bunker and learning all about the story and history of WW2 and the fall of Singapore. Very reasonable cost and both adults and children had a great time, the guide was excellent."
,,History explained,5.0,,"This was a most fascinating visit to times past. Our guide was excellent and explained the layout and design of the ""Battlebox"" and it's place in the defence of Singapore in 1943 extremely clearly. There were many aspects of this war episode which were unfamiliar to us and were highly interesting. The one hour tour was well worth it."
,,Excellent.,5.0,,"This was a fantastic place to visit, the guided tour was very well organised with very good displays. There is talk of opening this up for self guided tours, but taking a guide gives so much more information and gives atrue insight into this period of history."
,,Modern history must do,4.0,,"Really good tour, nice small groups & u get a good understanding of Singapore's modern history. Ask lots of questions the guides know what they are talking about & no question is dumb. Check the times before u go, I've put a picture up which lists them but they may change. Fair price for a good 1.5hr guided tour.
If u get a chance a short walk around the hill is a good thing."
,,Interesting tour,5.0,,Really interesting tour for only S$18. Story is told well and you get a good idea of what it would have been like at the time of surrender.
,,Battlebox Singapore,5.0,,A truly wonderful experience visiting a piece of history of the Fall of Singapore I was not aware existed. Had an outstanding young lady who took us on the tour and provided us with a great deal of the history of the Battlebox.
,,Great history tour,5.0,,I went on an afternoon tour a few days ago of this underground command bunker in Fort Canning park. The are a bout 20 steps down and then out of the bunker. You are guided through a series of rooms which are set up with wax models and furniture depicting the days of the Singapore surrender. I was totally engaged for the one hour and 15 minutes of the tour. The guide was excellent and very knowledgable. There are 3 mini archive films and maps and posters as well. The only suggestions for improvement would be to have better signposting to the ticket office and to enable online ticketing as their are only set guided tours so you have to time the attraction and buy tickets at the office. I combined this tour with a trip to the National Museum and accessed fort canning park from level three of the museum and the ticket office was a short walk away.
,,A most interesting and educational visit,5.0,,We had a guided tour of Battlebox conducted by a very knowledgable young man. The displays are very convincing. Our visit has enabled us to understand this period of the second World War
,,Professional & Engaging presentation,5.0,,"The young(ish) man who conducted the tour of this WW2 bunker did an exceptional job. I highly recommend this tour for anyone interested in the history of Singapore during this critical period in the war. The guide knew his stuff and created a sense of theatre and tension in the lead up to his presentation in the next room of this underground bunker. It created an unfolding story of what happened in the lead up to the surrender to Japanese forces and after. The 'Tussaud-standard' dummies were scarily life-like and really humanised & personalised the crisis these military leaders faced. Again - highly recommended tour. Please know you have to book in advance and it's underground in a bunker but, for me, not at all claustrophobic."
,,Thought provoking WR2 history,5.0,,"On our recent visit to Singapore, we spent some time at Battle Box and Fort Canning without a guide and it was very well laid out and informative. Highly recommended. General Percival should never had surrendered!"
,,Simply fascinating!,5.0,,"Of all the tours experienced in Singapore, this was the best. It seems like a best kept secret but our guide (Kimelijah = ""Mel"") brought everything alive with her extensive knowledge and vivid descriptions. Lasting a couple of hours for a modest entry fee, it was a chance to experience a little of near history. Some good, short video presentations."
,,Hard to find but worth it when we did,5.0,,Advised to visit here and when we did finally find it our time was well spent. Luckily we arrived 10 minutes before a tour was about to start as visiting unaccompanied is not allowed. Our guide was very informative the one and half hour tour went quickly. This was a former WW2 command centre and is set up to show the talks and strategy that lead up to the surrender of Singapore by the British to the invading Japanese.
,,Interesting tour,5.0,,"We took the tour 1 hour tour and enjoyed it completely. The guide Jerome was fantastic, he told the story of the events surrounding the Battle Box in an informative and interesting way. If you have an interest in the history of Singapore then you can not go wrong with this great tour."
,,The Singapore equivalent of the Churchill rooms in London - a gem,5.0,,"If you are in and around Fort Canning Park and interested in history then I recommend that you make time to visit the Battlebox. My husband and I only learned of its existence when we attended a lecture on a recent cruise. At the time it was likened to the Singapore equivalent of the Churchill Rooms in London and was until recently a hidden treasure. The docent, Mel, who led our tour was excellent, knowledgeable and enthusiastic – what more can you ask for in a guide? Previous reviews have pretty much said it all. This is a hidden gem with some reconstructed sets recreating history, exhibits and videos. I think we were all in turn aghast at the limited toilet facilities and then subdued by the Japanese writing on the walls. This was where history was made. Photos are prohibited. Pay attention to all the docent tells you for the chance to win a wee prize in their quiz. And resist the temptation to shout out the answer, hands up only!"
,,Fascinating insight into the surrender of singapore,4.0,,"Nicely planned tour, great guide and enough detail to keep interest without going overboard. A real insight into the decision the commanders were faced with."
,,Battlebox is brilliant,5.0,,"We did the standard Battlebox tour - 'A Story of Strategy and Surrender'. If you're interested in WW2 history, this tour should be top of your list of things to do whilst in Singapore. Even if you're not, the tour is great, very informative and I'd thoroughly recommend. It has a similar feel to the Churchill War Rooms in London. Our tour guide, Jerome, really knew his stuff. He helped to bring the dramatic events alive with his detailed commentary."
,,Fascinating 1 hour tour of historic WWII site,5.0,,"You travel as a group of people with a timed ticket, so buy your ticket from the information office well in advance if you want a particular time slot.
Very informative guide took us through many rooms within the bunker under the Fort Canning hill, each room with its own story. 2 short videos are also presented giving the build-up to invasion by Japanese, and the ill-equipped allied navy and air force.
Hard to imagine how 300 to 400 men coped in these corridors 75 years ago.
My only criticisms are: The group size was a little too large so we could not always see the posters etc. the guide was pointing to. Most rooms have interesting artifacts or detailed descriptions of activities during the battles however we did not have enough time allocated to read anything. You are not given any free time to go back and re-read anything.
Despite that I thoroughly recommend this visit and I will probably do it again in the future."
,,Beyond Expectation!,5.0,,"We join Battlebox Guided Tour and it is a very nice and informative. The tour is about early history of Singapore during the WW2 when Singapore was occupied by Japanese Empire. Our guide, Shah, was very enthusiastic in explaining every moment and milestone. He gave the tour attendees a little quiz in the end to win one special merchandise. Too bad we didn't win ;p"
,,A look back in history,5.0,,"This attraction is amazing, our guide was very knowledgeable, very well explained. You could imagine what the men went through. This is a must for all."
,,Great for history buffs,5.0,,A great little tour to understand the importance of Singapore in WW2. Interactive media display and guided tour gave fascinating insight into the fall of Singapore. Tours approx every 1.5hrs.
,,A must-see in Singapore!,5.0,,"Highly recommend this tour in Singapore, especially those who are interested in history and war and want to experience more than just the shopping (as many boyfriends/husbands endure).

Jerome our tour guide was very knowledgeable, and being able to explore the underground bunkers complete with wax statues was fantastic.

After the tour, visit the small Gelato ice cream place which has delicious selection of Gelato. It's next to the toilets inside the other building next to Battlebox."
,,History comes alive,5.0,,This is a wonderful overview of the fall of Singapore in 1942 with a tour of the underground command centre where General Percival met with his colleagues to make the difficult decision to surrender to the Japanese. Excellent film footage from the era and amazingly real wax figures bring to life the setting where this took place. We had an enthusiastic guide with Nancy - who helped us live through the horrors of defeat. This is just as good a display as the London War Cabinet Rooms!
,,Interesting historical displays,3.0,,Interesting place to visit. Some good exhibition items. Probably not the thing you drag along your (smaller) kids to visit.
,,Great history lesson,4.0,,The battlebox at fort canning was where the British army had underground bunkers during world war 2. The organised tour which takes 2 hours is excellent & explains why there was no option for general Percival except to surrender to the Japanese. There are mannequins of various people and several short videos. Definitely worth a visit
,,Fantastic Educational Tour,5.0,,"This was one of our last activities and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Our guide was excellent, so engaging and clearly had a passion for sharing the history of the Battlebox. We left more informed, and would thoroughly recommend this to any visitor to Singapore."
,,Really interesting!,5.0,,"Found the Battlebox for my partner as he loves war history, however I don't think you have to be a history buff to do this as I found it all to be really interesting. I highly recommend the 2hr tour - the time just flew by and the guide we had was excellent. He was very informative, friendly and enthusiastic which made the tour awesome. Definitely glad I did this!"
,,Learn the history,5.0,,"Visit this place, you have to join with tour guide. Please check the time for your visit. In this place, you will exploring underground history about the battle in World War II."
,,Interesting place,5.0,,Very interesting place. Our tour guide was excellent and it was wonderful to hear some of the history of Singapore. Highly recommend this hidden gem.
,,Excellent Tour,5.0,,"Fantastic guided tour around Battlebox. Highly recommend as a good balanced overview of The Fall of Singapore and WWII history. I don't usually like guided tours, but Mel was an excellent tour guide."
,,Excellent insight as to why LtGen Percival was forced to surrender in 1942,5.0,,"Excellent tour. Our guide, Jerome, was very informative and knowledgeable.

The tour takes in a walk through the underground bunker system with mannequins dressed in period uniform strategically placed in various rooms. The room where LtGen Percival made the decision to surrender is well laid out and it's easy to imagine the tension and strain that the commanders were under.

There's a couple of good video shows during the tour backing up the commentary of the guide."
,,Fantastic Tour at Battlebox,5.0,,Highly recommend the guided tour at Battlebox. Provides a great insight into Singapore history. Our tour guide Eisen was EXCELLENT! He was extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his subject. We learned so much from Eisen - he made it so interesting. A must for all visitors to Singapore.
,,An unexpected find - far exceeded expecations,5.0,,"To be honest I wasn't expecting much, but I was very pleased to have my expectations exceeded. We had the wonderfully knowledgable Jerome as our guide, who kept the entire group engaged and enthralled for the entire visit. Well worth a visit. Online ticket booking would be a great addition"
,,WW2 History Lesson,5.0,,"If you like history or simply are curious about what a WW2 bunker looks like, BattleBox is a great place to spend an hour. It is a relatively new museum, located in an underground bunker compound in Fort Canning originally built as a British combined military command centre emergency shelter in case of war. It was deemed too small for its purpose, but shortly after the Japanese invasion of Singapore 500 personnel moved back into the bunker, including the commanders. The bunker was abandoned after the war and very few people remembered its existence as it was well hidden from view until it was rediscovered in 1988 by a curious journalist.

In this Battle Box the military commanders directed the war effort against the Japanese but ultimately had to make the fateful decision to surrender. It is this heartbreaking moment in time that is captured in the museum.

The tour lasts about 60 minutes as a guide takes you from room to room and expains the history through video and old pictures on the wall as well as props and wax figures of the commanders and other personnel.

Our guide Jerome (?) was excellent, well versed in history and well spoken. The underground bunker is cool compared to the oppressive heat and humidity outside. This tour may be a little too advanced for children under 6, and I suggest that you not take your small children as they might get bored and/or start crying which is very disruptive as we found out during our tour. Our guide had to escort a parent with a crying child outside, leaving us alone in one room for a few minutes. There are no bathroom facilities inside the bunker, and no benches or chairs to rest.

Right now the tours are led by a guide, and although there is talk about self-guided tours, it may take a while before this becomes reality.

Word has gotten out about this attraction, so either buy tickets in advance or be at the ticket office half an hour before the tour to ensure you get a ticket."
,,Excellent Guided Tour,5.0,,"An enjoyable and informative tour about the history of WWII in Singapore and Malay. It's truly and experiential experience as we walked around the underground bunker. We were very fortunate to have a professional, knowledgeable and articulate guide, Eisen, who made the tour come alive. I highly recommend the guided tour."
,,It's got a lot better,5.0,,Have been here six times over the years. Now under new management. They have opened up a lot more room. Worth a visit to see How they surrendered Singapore. Out standing tour guide Joanne did a great job. $18 for an adult well worth it and the question at the end is 29. You can not take photos in side a shame.
,,Interesting piece of history.,5.0,,"The Battle Box has only been re-opened for just under 1 year to the public. Plans are in motion to offer self guided tours with audio.

Our tour was guided by ""Mel"". She was very knowledgeable about the Battle Box and the history behind the fort.

The tour took just over an hour to complete. The bunkers are about 9m underground so there is a bit of an echo. If you have children with poor discipline, they may ruin the tour for others.

If you are doing a tour of WWII history, this is a must for your list. You walk through a number of rooms with wall displays as well as an explanation from your guide."
,,Battlebox review,5.0,,"It was fantastic. I highly recommend to go there! And everyone is so friendly. If you want to see live history, you have to go there !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,,If you are a history buff - not to be missed,4.0,,I have visited this place several times because I like the feel of history that surrounds this place. A very poignant experience very time. I am not going to say much because you have to experience to understand what I am sharing. Some may find the pricing a little stiff so please check it all pout before you set out to the Battlebox.
,,Brilliant Singapore Museum experience,5.0,,"We first visited the museum in April 2007 and the very much enjoyed the experience. Then it was self guided and each room told a story with the characters of the day telling a narrative in the form of automated mannequins. 10 years later and much has changed for the better - this time we were guided by a very informative guide called Shar. Ex Singapore Army Infantry officer and now guide of the newly renovated Battle Box, Shar shared with us his incredible knowledge of this facility, the events leading up to the invasion of Singapore and the final surrender to the Japanese. Have a guide share his knowledge of the events that took place in this area and also the historical events of the time was brilliant. The museum needs to continue using guides for this experience. WWII buffs should not miss this museum located on Fort Canning Hill."
,,Battle box museum,5.0,,"We had a really good experience here. In transit at Singapore, before flying on further, we had 6 hours to kill and wanted to see this museum as last time we were in Singapore it was closed for renovation. Our plane got in at 6am and we spent time at the airport before we caught a taxi to the museum. We were there early so walked about Fort Canning Park to pass the time until it was open at 9.45 for the first tour. The staff were very helpful and when they learned we were in transit took particular care to ensure we were finished our tour (a little over an hour) in time to get a taxi which they called for us to take us back to the airport. The lady guide Anu was very enthusiastic and overall the whole experience was very good."
,,my review,5.0,,The guide ( Aisha ) is really nice and friendly. She could told all the history of battlebox in interesting way. The atmosphere of the bunker really made the history came alive again. The schedule was on time as told in the brochure.
,,Informative tour,5.0,,Well worth the effort of going on this tour. Sharu gave a very moving account of the Japanese offensive and the surrender to Japan. Highly recommended
,,History Alive,5.0,,"Had history at school been this interesting I would have done much better.
This tour made the history come alive and Jerome our guide conveyed his message with passion. Visited with extremely knowledgeable historians who could not fault his knowledge or delivery despite their anticipation to do just that."
,,Worthwhile and interesting,5.0,,If you are a history buff this is a must do! WWII The Fall of Singapore is a conducted tour with a great informative guide. With displays and models.
,,A piece of historyf,5.0,,An amazing recreation of an world war 2 bunker. You actually get to see how they operated from small bunkers and how the communication and management happened. A very unique experience and a must visit.
,,A historian's dream,5.0,,A great exhibit to revisit how the British surrendered to the Japanese during World War II. The underground bunker has been meticulously preserved with wax figurines to depict British officers and soldiers. Highly recommend this exhibit to anyone who has a penchant for history. The tour is conducted by a live guide but is supplemented with wall displays and video clips.
,,TOUR OF BATTLEBOX - SINGAPORE,5.0,,"When visiting Singapore and you would really like to get to the 'grass roots' of its' History, a tour of the Battlebox is essential.

The tour is performed with qualified and certificated historians who have a passionate link with their country's past and prove to be excellent ambassadors for Singapore when relating the history to visitors.

Parents traveling with children must consider this really isn't an interactive tour as children cannot touch or play with the exhibits. Realistically, children under the age of 8 or 9 would not find a great deal of entertainment on this tour as there is a lot of historical 'fact and information' related to Singapore and as we all know - kids hate schooling at the best of times !

Be prepared to be thoroughly impressed by a historical site which disappeared from sight and was lost for over 40 years."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"This may be 18 dollars but it is 18 dollars very well spent. The guide really brings the 1940s war between Singapore and Japan to life, with some fabulous stories, footage, photos and relics. There is real life footage of the British surrendering to the Japanese in 1942, which can send the tears running.

This is guided tour only and the tours do fill up, so turn up an hour or so in advance in order to guarantee your place. Tour times are:
9.45
11.00
13.30
14.45
16.00
Tours say they take 1 hour, but our guide was so enthusiastic it lasted over an hour and a half.

The museum is closed on Monday mornings (with the earliest tour starting at 13.30), but is open all day on every other day."
,,Listen and Learn.,5.0,,The Battlebox tour is something that I found most interesting. A lot of detail given by the guide and the structure is massive with its many rooms built in the hilltop of Canning Park.
,,WWII historical place to visit,5.0,,"The tour is scheduled at 11 am, 13:30pm, 14:45pm,....need advance booking, as it full up quickly.
1.5 hours tour inside a cave in Canning Park.
My tour guide, Sha, explained the WWII in detail. His talk was clear and interesting.
1.5 hours went quickly. The shop is small but some interesting books on sales."
,,Great Tour,5.0,,Thank you Kamaliah for a great tour today it was very informative. If you are interested in WWII history or the fall of Singapore this is a great way to have the surrounding times explained by an experienced guide inside quite a unique period building. It would be great to see into the future the option of a self guided tour (so you could spend more time in the rooms/places that interested you) but these should be offered alongside of the guided tours and not instead of.
,,Fascinating guided tour of history.,5.0,,"Our guide Sha really knew his stuff, the detail was amazing. My 2 teenage sons thought this was one of the best things in Singapore. I would recommend it to anyone with even a vague interest in the fall of Singapore."
,,Well worth the time,5.0,,A great overview of the battle for Singapore and where and why the decision was made to surrender. It was an hour to be in the bunker where the decisions were made.
,,A must for history buffs,5.0,,We had a great guide who brought to life the history of this WW2 command bunker and the fall of Singapore to Imperial Japan.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Such an interesting place to visit especially if you want to learn about the Second World War era and the British surrender.
,,Really interesting,4.0,,"The Battlebox is worth the walk up to it. Lots of interesting facts and information is delivered by the tour guide. Currently you have to go with a guide so check the times to arrive and avoid having a long wait. My guide Sha, made the tour very enjoyable, as I'm sure the other guides do. Unfortunately you cannot take photos of the Box which is the only downside."
,,A must see for history buffs,5.0,,"It is a strictly guided tour only so you need to plan ahead what tour time you want. It is only a small place but there are so many interconnected chambers and hallways that look the same so it easy to get lost inside. The Battle Box story narrated by the tour guide is a very important part of Singapore and World War 2 history. Jerome, our tour guide, is very knowledgeable and speaks very fluent English. After the tour I know a bit more about Singapore and Malaysia and how their histories are very close the Philippines where I came from being inhabited by a Malay race with similar if not exactly the same culture, society and ruling royal system."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"This is the best $38 Singapore Dollars ever spent! The 1.5 hours we spent with our guide, Sharul, was both very informative and an enlightening way to understand what happened in 1942 with the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese. This has to be one of those hidden treasures that is a must whilst visiting this fabulous city. Well done to those involved in the restoration."
,,Impressive!,4.0,,"I just went to this tour because of my partner's interest in military and war history, and i must say, i made the right decision.

The guided tour is very informative as our guide is very knowledgeable. You would get to walk inside the command center tunnel where facts are being presented through videos, and displays in rooms with life-size replicas of people who played vital roles in the fall of Singapore.

Amazing how this tunnel was preserved, and brilliantly transformed into a museum.

This may be quite a long walk from the mrt station (doby ghaut), but definitely worth it. Its airconditioned, which is a refreshing respite from a hot day in singapore.

The guided tours are scheduled several times during the day, so please check the time at their website before going there.

Definitely worth a visit when in Singapore."
,,essential singapore tour,5.0,,anyone with an inkling of a thirst for history must visit the battlebox. this is living singapore history. perfectly preserved and expertly brought to life by passionate guides. i would go everyday.
,,Excellent Historical Tour,5.0,,"A fascinating historical tour of the World War 2 British command center including the strategies adopted by the British and Japanese leading to the the Fall of Singapore. The tour includes a walk around by an enthusiastic and well informed guide, video presentation and scenes showing key meetings and people involved."
,,Mandatory tour,5.0,,"Very glad to have taken the 75 minute tour which felt barely adequate. Battlebox deserves wider recognition (locals and cab didn't know about it, etc)."
,,A boxful of learning is here.,5.0,,"As a Japanese, I learned a lot with my 11 year-old son and it's also a great opportunity to learn the whole picture of the battle between Japan and the UK. We talked about the meaninglessness of the war on our way back home with my son. You will get more than what you pay."
,,The guide made this interesting,4.0,,"I really enjoyed this tour and I learnt a lot about the fall not of just singapore but Malaysia also. The whole tour was air conditioned so it made it really comfortable. I was interesting to see actual gravity on the walls from the british soldiers and Japanese soldiers. On the whole it was a great tour, It would of been even better if they had original artefacts rather than replicas but that can't be helped as the tunnel had been looted at the end of the wall, very worthwhile and worth the price"
,,Chris,5.0,,"Excellent tour, with an excellent guide Jerome well worth the ticket price. Learned a lot about WW2 in this region."
,,Must do,5.0,,"A visit to the Battlebox is something I would add to the list of ""must dos"" while in Singapore. This tour is very interesting and provides insight into the events surrounding the surrender of Singapore in World War II. Much effort has gone into recreating the Battlebox as it would have looked at the time. Special mention must be made of our guide Mel was so knowledgeable and engaging and made our visit to this historical place something we would certainly highly recommend."
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"The Battlebox is a very interesting place and well worth a visit. Our guide was very knowledgeable and we learnt a great deal about the fall of Singapore, the personalities involved and the mistakes made as well as the courageous decisions made in the Battlebox in the final hours. The facility is a work in progress and we will certainly visit again when next in Singapore."
,,Excellent story of WWII,5.0,,"Thoughtful and thought provoking tour by the delightful Anu. More of a history about WWII that is rarely told in any detail in England. If you ever wondered how so many Commenwealth troops ended up in Japanese prison camps you will find out here.

Easy to get to from Orchard and a great way to spend an hour."
,,I really enjoyed this,5.0,,"It wasn't really the underground site that made the visit, it was the first class guided tour. The information provided by the guide whilst seeing with your own eyes the conditions in which the soldiers worked, was so interesting. The complete story of the Fall of Singapore is told and everyone will come out with a different opinion of events I am sure. An interesting and thought provoking visit for all ages that are interested in such things."
,,Must See at Fort Canning,5.0,,"Having an interest in WW11 History a tour or simple walk around Fort Canning is a must. You can see the remnants of the Fort itself and Sir Stamford Raffles residence. But the highlight was the Battlebox tour which was the underground headquarters of the British command at the time the Japanese invaded Singapore and Malaysia. The reopening of this historical place in June 2016 was a brilliant exercise of the managing tour company with what original items they could salvage and the wax figures of the Officers involved in the fateful decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese so lifelike. The tour guide we had was very knowledgeable, well spoken and a delight to learn from. My pics are minimal as we were forbidden taking any pics.?? as there are Trip Advisor pics taken mid March - good pics have a look at them."
,,Excellent Guided Battlebox Tour - A Must Do in Singapore,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the 1,5 hour tour of the Battlebox in Fort Canning Park. Our Tour guide Mel was very knowledgeable and very informative. We learned so much of this fascinating place and the key decisions made in the underground bunker during the Japanese invasion and the fall of Singapore. Check their website for guided tour times."
,,"Great History, Well Told",5.0,,"Congratulations to the private company which took over tours at this site two years ago and developed a tour which includes films, wax figures acting out historical events, lectures and questions to the audience to bring alive WWII Singapore. I have read a lot and never figured out before that with the International Date Line, Pearl Harbor and Singapore were attacked on the same day! And, I always blamed poor Percival-- lots more facts gave him some real depth here. It's a good tour, even the kids in our group liked it. Groups are about 10-12, so you can ask questions and are not crowded."
,,Thoroughly Enjoyable,5.0,,"We were looking for a WWII tour that provided the historical background of Singapore and elected to visit Fort Canning. A Tour of the Battlebox, the command centre for Singapore, was about to commence so we joined in. We were not disappointed and found the tour very informative and learnt many important points about the surrender of Singapore on 15 February 1942. The tour guide, Kamaliah, was very professional and knowledgeable and she explained that a new company had taken over the renovation and upkeep of the Battlebox in 2016.
We took the 'Story of Strategy and Surrender' tour and had the circumstances behind the Japanese invasion and subsequent surrender of Singapore by the British explained to us. There were many details that we were not aware of including the valiant defence of the vital NW coast of Singapore by the Australian 8th Division against the far superior Japanese forces led by the infamous General Yamashita.
Would recommend this tour followed by a walk around the grounds if you get time. There is a new MTR station being built at Fort Canning which will make it easier to take public transport to this location in the future."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,Surprisingly not a well known museum so even our taxi driver had to be told where to find it. My husband wanted to visited and surprised how interesting it was. Our historian was great and very knowledgeable.
,,Informative Info on Fall of Singapore,5.0,,"The scheduled Battlebox tours of the wartime command centre under Fort Canning Hill are under advertised.
As an older person interested in military history I was pleasantly surprised by the comprehensive and informative hour long tour.
Mal was a clear and well-educated guide who handled our small group very professionally.
The complexity of the 25 room bunker was quite an eye opener and the detailed analysis of the reasons informing the surrender decision were delivered with clarity.
A really good way to spend an hour for anyone with even a moderate interest in military history."
,,What a great find!,5.0,,"Stumbled across the Battle Box when walking around Fort Canning Park, and very happy we did. What a professionally run, informative and memorable tour of the Battle Box. Jerome our guide was fantastic - extremely knowledgeable, with attention to detail and impeccable timing, all the thing I like Highly recommend a trip to Fort Canning Park and the Battle Box; you won't be disappointed!"
,,Really worthwhile,5.0,,"If you have any interest (or even might have) in the fall of Singapore in WW2 at all then this has to be the tour for you. The guide was excellent and the tour was very clear, informative and well constructed. I also did a trip to Changi Museum on this trip, but I thought the Battle Box tour was much better presented."
,,Highly informative and fun,5.0,,"Our guide was great and the whole tour overall was very educational without being too much at once. It's a good crash course into understanding Singaporean modern history, and to get a perspective of WWII from an Asian perspective, which was never really dealt with in my history books at school in the UK."
,,The greatest tour of a secret shame,5.0,,This tour was amazing the tour guide Jerome was brilliant and really clear. I learned a lot that I had never been told about the not only the bunker but the people at the time of the surrender. A must see and if you get Jerome guiding you you will not be disappointed.
,,Interesting & informative,5.0,,"Great tour, Eisen, was very passionate about the history and kept it really interesting for the whole group which consisted of all age groups. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who has an interest in the history around World War 2."
,,A Fabulous Tour,5.0,,A very informative and extremely well presented tour of the history of Fort Channing and the fall of Singapore.
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"The Battle Box guided tour was an amazing experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Singapore. Sharun, our guide did an incredible job and he happily shared so much information which made things come alive.
The whole area of Fort Canning is well worth a visit."
,,The facinating story of Singapore during WW2,4.0,,"This is a very well organised tour of the bunkers.
The guide we had was outstanding. She had a great knowledge of the facts and answered everyone's questions with ease.
Not for young kids they would be bored.
A cool thing to do on a hot steamy day!"
,,Underground,5.0,,Any guided tour is made so much better by the quality of the guide and as the Battlebox can only by seen via a tour it was our fortune to have an excellent tour guide.
,,Very impressed,5.0,,"A long hot climb led us to the Battle Box. The 2.45 tour was late leaving so we were in luck. A very well presented tour full of, for us, some new information regarding the surrender of Singapore.
Surprised that they didn't know the abbreviation AA&QMG, they do now.
A must for any visitor to Singapore."
,,Battlebox tour,5.0,,"Walking where the WW11 command post of the British soldiers walked made this war all the more real, sad and hard to comprehend. Life size models around a table helped understand the reasoning of the surrender to the Japanese."
,,Unreal,5.0,,"If you only see one thing in Singapore, the Battlebox must be it! Access is only by guided tour at certain times and I was so impressed by the tour that I was actually glad not to have looked around alone. The guides really know their stuff and they break down the reasons for the British defeat in Malaya and Singapore to the basics that make the disaster seem so much greater than it sounds in books. Land, sea, air, communications and strategy are all covered and extremely life-like dummies man the restored rooms where the British ran the war from. It was an eerie feeling to visit the conference room where the surrender decision was taken and to think about how the commanders must have felt in that moment. Easily the most interesting WWII site I have visited in the world so far. Don't miss out!"
,,History visit,5.0,,"A great museum with full of history. The guide was great, he had a great knowladge about the battlebox."
,,Interesting attraction - whihc needs more time to read the boards in each room,3.0,,"A really interesting and unique look into the lead up to the British surrender to the Japanese in Singapore. Lead by a very passionate young lady who gave impressive insight into the history of the Battlebox.
However there is much important and relevent history in each room on information boards and maps and the like... which due to the length of the tour and guidance was unable to be read... and therefore missed. A shame as i enjoy reading the information which many people have taken time to put together but was unable to be read / and indeed rushed through each room.
A future addition of unguided tours and personal head sets for each room will be a very valued initiative. Thanks / a worthy hour and half."
,,new experience,5.0,,"Been to singapore many times, but this was my first time in fort canning. My sister & I joined the one-hour guided tour of battlebox. Our guide was Eisen, he was a very passionate & knowledgable guide. I personally enjoyed the tour very much, despite my little understanding of the war history. Highly recommended"
,,Great Visit,5.0,,"A really interesting place to visit if in Singapore. The figures were so lifelike you could imagine yourself being there with them. A ""must see"" if visiting Singapore. John & Gail Laney"
,,Interesting visit,4.0,,An interesting place to visit with an excellent and knowledgeable guide. The restored rooms looked authentic and the history and context of the place was well explained.
,,Informed of History,5.0,,I have always held an interest in WW 11 and had a personal interest in the Fall of Singapore in that i had relatives who served here. The two hours spend at the Battlebox were highlights of our visit to Singapore. The building and exhibits were extremely interesting and the narrative by the tour guide excellent. My wife who has little interest in this subject was absorbed throughout. Thank you.
,,Good experience,4.0,,I would like to tell my friends to go and visit to Battle box if they visit to Singapore. My cousins enjoyed very much about history of Singapore.
,,Great guided tour,5.0,,Well worth the $18 (Singapore) entrance fee and the walk up the hill. Our guide was really professional and we learnt a lot about why the British had to surrender Singapore in 1942. Our guide made the tour even more interesting by issuing a challenge and offering a prize at the end!
,,An educational eye-opener.,5.0,,"We booked a guided tour of the Battlebox. Our guide, Eisen, was passionate about his subject and spoke perfect English. The Battlebox was an underground bomb-proof command centre and part of the headquarters of Malaya Command. It was famously the site of the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. The tour illustrates the life of the occupants with reconstructed scenes in more than 20 rooms. Eisen's commentary was full of fascinating anecdotes about the people and events of the time. He managed to keep our keen interest during the entire tour. The site is set in Fort Canning Hill, a large park with a history going back some 700 years - worthy of a visit in its own right."
,,A Bit of History,5.0,,This was a very interesting tour of the bunker the mannequins in the displays were very life like and our guide was very knowledgeable. It really gave an insight into the fall of Singapore in the Second World War.
,,Great Tour,5.0,,"We had a young tour guide by the name of Izen, sorry if the spelling is wrong and he was very good, very informative and quite passionate about the history and the stories he told us during the tour under groud at Fort Canning, well worth the time and money for this tour, must see if your in Singapore"
,,Great Attraction No One Has Heard About,5.0,,I found this tour very interesting and informative. The tour was quite casual and has specific start times as you need a guide to bring you through.
,,Battle box in Singapore Canning Park,5.0,,"Wonderful tour guide 'Nancy' very enthralling, she made it come alive. Top marks!!!! A good precursor to visiting Changi."
,,Looking at history,5.0,,"This was the most informative tour that my wife and I have been on and would recommend it to anyone visiting Singapore to go on well done, the tour guide was also excellent and informative thank you. Keep up the good work. Pete and Jenny UK."
,,Happy daze at Fort Canning,4.0,,"An interesting look at the demise of Singapore and the British, Indian and Australian forces in 1942. This was the HQ for the British forces. Tour cost is S$18.00 per adult. Nearest metro is Dhoby Ghaut and then a nice walk (up the hill) through the park."
,,Must see,5.0,,"This was an excellent tour (led by Joanne) explaining the functioning of the Battle Box, how it came to be, who the players were in the Battle of Singapore and why these things happened. The film portions were good, the models were well set up and everything flowed well. When (if) they get this set up on a self guided audio tour basis it'll be even better."
,,Excellent tour,5.0,,"This is not my usual cup of tea. I went because my partner was keen, however the tour was very interesting and well put together and the guide was very knowledgeable!"
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,"I didn't know military history could be so interesting until I took the Battlebox tour. Jerome, our guide, was brilliant. I found it fascinating. I highly recommend this experience."
,,Outstanding visit,5.0,,Unsure what to expect but i was hooked the lady tour guide was so informative and passionate about the story and really opened my eyes to the real story of the fall of singapore - you must go its superb
,,An amazing trip through history.,5.0,,"Visited the Battlebox today, and was impressed by the experience. To visit the Battlebox you need to join one of the guided tours. These run frequently throughout the day, however it is worth checking the times to ensure you don't miss your chance. Mel gave a tour that was informative and interesting, allowing me to gain an understanding of what life was like for the army in the final weeks before their surrender. Great experience and a chance to glimpse a past time."
,,Hidden away (no pun intended),5.0,,"Bizarrely not mentioned much by the guidebooks which tend to focus on stuff like Marina Bay (impressive though that is) and the shopping (other places have shops) - this is obviously unique to Singapore (and to British military history - a surrender). Could be far, far better promoted as it's a fascinating story presented very well indeed by the guide - our guide was Jerome, excellent - and it's a salutary tale with much to reflect upon. Not to denigrate what the books do focus on but to downplay this is a bit weird. Highly recommended 1 hour tour, brilliantly done."
,,Terrific Tour,4.0,,"Pros: Jerome (guide) was knowledgeable and spoke clearly. His grasp of the events, place names, people, relationships, strategy, history seems encyclopedic.

Cons: 1. Tour size was far too big. I recommend no more that 10 people (preferably less) because the spaces are small.
2. The tour is rushed. There are lots of displays and plaques - there was no time to really look at the photographs, read the notices or appreciate what it must have been like to be in the Battlebox during the busy days as the Japanese were advancing on Singapore.

Do not miss the stroll around the hilltop - there are good views and there is an outdoor walking tour too with additional information dating back to the early history of Singapura (sic)."
,,Excellent tour of a major piece of history,5.0,,"This 1.5 hour guided tour of the bunker was very well done, our guide was very clear and fully knew what she was talking about. Very informative, a really interesting insight of what was happening leading up to and during the fall of Singnapore"
,,Must see when visiting Singapore,5.0,,"A visit to Battlebox should be included in all tourists ""what to see in Singapore"" list. The tour is most informative about the history of Singapore but in particular the events during World War 11.
Our guide, Gerome was very knowledgable. The amount of information he shared was outstanding and he readily accepted questions.
All in all an excellent tour"
,,Fascinating tour,5.0,,"Fascinating and yet quite harrowing at times. We had been to the Changi Prison Museum in the morning so this visit completed the story. The Battlebox combined videos, pictures, waxwork figures and recreations of some of the activities in the rooms to provide an informative and challenging account of the events leading up to the surrender of Singapore. Had an excellent guide in Aysha who took us through the story and brought out how stressful the situation must have been for the commanders at the time. Not a tour for everybody but if you have an interest in the fall of Singapore then this is a must."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Both my wife and I believed that we had a good grasp of Singapore's history during WW2, however after spending a few hours at Fort Canning and taking part in the Battlebox Tour we realised what little we actually knew, the tour is excellent and our guide Jerrome was extremely informative.....highly recommended!"
,,Great Tour,5.0,,This is a very interesting and educational tour. So awesome to see how it was set up during the war and relive the past. Highly recommended. Our tour guide was very clear and informative.
,,Nice history lesson by a person with a lot of knowledge,5.0,,"Our guide for the day was Jerome. Jerome has a very good knowledge about the place and you could see that he was too very interested about these things.

At least in history education in Europe the pacific war and especially this event is often overshadowed by the events in Pearl Harbor and the war in Europe. Therefore this is a great way to learn more about this important location and history of Singapore. It's spectacular that this kind of place is so well preserved in the middle of a buzzing city like Singapore.

Do yourself a favor and take this tour. It'll be one of the things you remember the most after your trip."
,,Must visit for people interested in history specially military history,5.0,,genuinely interested in knowing about the WWII or military history. Must visit this place. very well maintained. actually underground ops room of the british army. retained as such. good movies and audio visuals to make you understand the past of the city country. educative for young adults.
,,Excellent bit of WW-II history,4.0,,"I enjoyed my wander around the Mt. Canning Reservoir and all the historical exhibits & displays there - particularly including the old British ""Battlebox"" stronghold. I've seen many WW-II sites throughout the Pacific, and was glad to see & add this one; it's a key site in the modern history of Southeast Asia. The exhibits & tour were excellent."
,,Battlebox,4.0,,Very interesting on the history of Singapore during 2nd world war. Fascinating to see how a country has come so far in a mere 50 years.
,,Very interesting,5.0,,This museum and the guided tours are very informative and interesting. You can really feel the stress the commanders were under and understand the role Singapore had played in WWII.
,,Excellent Tour and History Lesson,5.0,,"My wife and I cannot speak highly enough of how Singapore and the staff at the Battlebox have restored and tell visitors the story of the Battlebox. The tour was supposed to be 1.25 hours, but it ended up about 1.75 hours as we were asking questions and our guide, Anau, was very happy to answer them. Her knowledge of the events of the fall of Singapore and the history of the Battlebox is encyclopedic and she made the whole thing come to life for our tour. Thankyou Anau!"
,,Battlebox is nothing less than an excellent historic 'must see' Singapore attraction.,5.0,,"Although I'd visited Singapore on several occasions over the past 10 years I had never even heard of the ""Battlebox"". Located on Fort Canning Hill this underground Allied Command Bunker from WW.II is where the momentous decision to surrender to the invading Japanese forces was made on 15th Feb 1942. Constructed in the 1930's and 9m underground this 27 room bunker is now a fascinating museum that has been superbly done with lifelike exhibits,old artifacts, maps, photographs and film footage to deliver a highly educational and attention grabbing 90 minute tour. Tours are limited to 25 persons per tour and they only run 9:30-5:30 each day, so I suggest you book in advance. I did this by phone but you can also do this using email. Cost for the 90 minute tour is SGP$18 (circa GB£11) and worth every cent. Our young university student guide, Kelysha, was outstanding... Really knowledgeable and an excellent presenter who spoke perfect English clearly and in a way that told the story like a gripping Thriller. There are no photos allowed inside the Battlebox but there is a good gift shop at the Battlebox Visitor Centre where the tours start and finish. This is the best tour I have done in a long while and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone visiting Singapore for a few days."
,,Loved it...,5.0,,"A really interesting tour, are guide was very informative, if you love history, you will love this...."
,,Visit,5.0,,I was stained in Singapore in the Emergency during armed forces service but this site was only uncovered in 1999 so i had no idea that it existed. Very informative guide.
,,Excellent! 10/10!,5.0,,Can't believe I've lived in Singapore 6 years and just recently stumbled across this gem. A must for anyone.. visitor or local. Our guide Shar really made the experience a stand out.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,We visited today and our guide Jerome was fantastic . He had a thorough knowledge of the subject and made the visit very interesting . The tour lasted nearly an hour and a half and was in the bunkers throughout. Not really suitable for young children - had a little lad in our tour and he was noisy and not interested !!!! A MUST visit !
,,Signal defeat,5.0,,"An enjoyable and fascinating tour of this underground bunker in the grounds of Fort Canning, Singapore. Despite being urged by Churchill to fight to the last man, this is where where Lt-Gen Percival and his allied commanders decided that they had no option but to surrender to the Japanese, a signal defeat that marked the beginning of the end of the British Empire. Percival was not the greatest of generals but we learnt from our excellent guide, Anu, that he faced overwhelming odds. He had no air cover, no naval back-up, no tanks and was running out of food, ammunition and water. The room where the last meeting took place is enlivened with realistic figures of Percival and his men gathered around a large table. All a bit eerie; after the visitors have left and the Battlebox is locked up for the night one can imagine them coming back to life and once again arguing among themselves whether to fight on or to throw in the towel."
,,Interesting tour,5.0,,"Perfect for history lovers! Knowing about the Pacific Wars from American perspective, it was great to learn from Singaporean view. Interesting tour - well worth the 90 minutes -- we all loved it!"
,,Great insight into the events leading to the British surrender,5.0,,"We did the bunker tour which lasted closer to 90 mins than 60mins it is marketed at. It is a guided tour through the rooms of the bunker that moves fairly fast through each of the rooms, and combines photos, staged props and short films. Our group included a 5 year old and his 70 year old grandparents. Our guide Sharul was knowledgeable about the events, and was able to convey history in an engaging and easy to understand way.

Request to management: please do not replace guided tours with audio. It is more enriching to have great guides to lead you through. Perhaps provide the option of both instead?

This tour in Fort Canning park is terrific. There are no graphic images, but it is moving, especially for those who were directly impacted by these events or had relatives who were fighting here.

No special fitness required, is well lit, and has a.c.! Tours are capped at a certain amount. Recommend booking online or get there 30 mins prior to tour. Our 1.30pm tour on wed was full.

Make time to check out this historical and educational place. When getting here, ask the taxi driver to take you to fort canning park rather than the bunker, many Singaporeans do not seem to be aware of the bunkers existence."
,,The Battle Box - Fort Canning,5.0,,"Excellent 90 minute guided tour of the underground bunker, our guide was most informative and provided an incite into little known facts about the decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. Well worth the visit. Sharyn - Australian visitor"
,,Well worth the ninety minute guided tour,5.0,,"This is a fascinating tour of the under ground command headquarters of the British during the Japanese invasion of Singapore. With Britain struggling to defend itself and support the rest of Europe against the German invasion threat, it left Singapore very defenceless when the Japanese invasion came. This tour tells the story - and much more besides. The tour takes about 90 minutes and must be pre-book. There are plans for self guided tours to begin later in the year but the guided tours really are worth doing for all the information passed on in a very accessible way."
,,Fantastic Tour - A Must Do,5.0,,"We really enjoyed a tour this morning with Eisen (hope I have spelt that correctly!). You learn so much with a perfect mixture of film, the guide telling you the history in a way you remember and having a long look round the Battle Box. The story of the fall of Singapore is so affecting. What was good here was to understand the ""perfect storm"" of conditions which lead to this catastrophe but also I felt we got under the skin of the officers and men too by learning about squabbles and claustrophobic working conditions.

Practicalities- 18 Sing Dollars per person. Definitely worth it. Near the MRT Dhoby Gaut. Tours get very busy - our 11am tour was full. We got to the beautiful Park at 10, booked our tickets and then went on some walking trails.

Staff are friendly and helpful.

I highly recommend this 5* Tour."
,,Battle box tour,5.0,,This was a wonderful tour which lasted an hour and a half taking us through the underground bunker with its many rooms. Eisen our tour guide made it very interesting as he passionately explained the plight of the British command and what lead to the surrender of Singapore. It made you realise what an impossible position the British were in. This tour was certainly unique and I would certainly recommend it. We visited on a really hot day so it was a bonus/welcome relief to get into the cool air.
,,Extremely moving,5.0,,Hard to believe that 70 odd years ago Singapore fell. The tour conducted today by Jerome was so informative yet respectful. Thankyou Jerome. Would recommend this tour to anyone.
,,Fascinating insight into the Fall of Singapore,5.0,,"The Battlebox is absolutely absorbing. Currently you can only take guided tours, but by later in 2017 they hope to allow standard visits instead of the tours. The tours are really good though - you learn a huge amount about the build up in Singapore and Malaya, and the way that the Japanese advance was hugely underestimated. The lack of resources and lack of up to date information and communications lead directly to the most embarrassing surrender in British and Commonwealth military history. The stories make you shake your head at the way the campaign went, and the aftermath. Excellent way to spend a couple of hours."
,,History,5.0,,"Very touching, 18 dollars per person, memorabilia and excellent books, walking tour and three videos total tour took 1.15 minutes. Kel was very knowledgeable and tried to be funny but some didn't get her jokes. The signing of the surrender to Japan ."
,,Interesting and well structured tour,5.0,,"Very well put together tour and excellent guide, Jerome, whose extensive knowledge made the whole experience well worth the visit."
,,Battlebox Tour,5.0,,"Very good and informative tour, well put together and dispelling some myths that have been taken as fact in the Fall of Singapore. A lot of work renovating the site has been done, and I understand more is to be done, so look forward to returning next year and see what has been done. I would recommend you make some time to do the Tour when you visit Singapore, Fort Canning Park is well worth the visit too."
,,Fantastic insight into Singaporean history,5.0,,"The tour around The Battlebox is a highly informative and engaging experience telling the story of Singapore's involvement in WW2.
The tour leads you through the original underground bunker with various rooms set up as they would have been during operations.
Our tour guide was exceptionally knowledgable, adding to the whole experience and kept the whole 90 minute tour entertaining and interesting.
I would recommend this as it really captures the events and consequences of the surrender of Singapore, and how that fitted in within the greater context of WW2."
,,Battle box tour,5.0,,Fantastic and informative. Tour guide was excellent. Gave a good overview of the fall of Singapore and events leading to it. Underground tour of the bunkers was very interesting.
,,Excellent Historical View of Wartime Singapore,5.0,,Mel was such an amazing tour guide and we were blown away by her breadth and depth of knowledge. A must for anyone interested in the WW2 history of Singapore.
,,Amazing visit,5.0,,"After I left , I felt I just had attended a high level university class, thanks to Jerome who certainly is one of the best guides one could meet. I have learned so much during this tour, I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves history."
,,Intersting tour and great guide,5.0,,"It was interesting and explained well, will recommended to people interested in this period and the war"
,,excellent tour,5.0,,A must do passionate knowledgeable staff. a truly memorable tour. Not to be missed. this tour is so much more than you expect a must do
,,A must see for those interested in the Second World War,5.0,,"As my grandfather was captured in Singapore in the Second World War the Battlebox was a must see on my list. I was not dissapointed. Our guide Shural was extremely knowledgeable about the history of the tunnels, he gave us a great insight into the people in charge during the fall of Singapore. After viewing the video at the end I was almost in tears, In fact one woman in the group was weeping. It was a very emotional tour."
,,History revealed,5.0,,"This was an excellent experience, both informative and enlightening. The guide was very good, explaining what an invidious situation the Allies were in, and how they really had no other alternative than to surrender. Several myths were exploded, many years after the bombs!"
,,Excellent tour of the Fall of Singapore,5.0,,"The Battlebox is a military command bunker on Fort Canning, recently rediscovered. It was the location of the headquarters of the British Army defending Singapore from the invading Japanese army in february of 1942. The Army surrendered very shortly after occupying the bunker, however, as it was clear that the Japanese were significantly more powerful than the British Army, although the latter was much larger. The surrender was very significant for the tide of the war, and was the worst defeat in Britain's history. The tour guide was superb: knowledgeable, competent, interesting and efficient, and everyone thoroughly enjoyed the experience, which took more than an hour. We explored all aspects of the bunker, and gained a good sense of how it all worked. A shame that photos were not permitted (and not clear why they are not permitted), but otherwise I thoroughly recommend this tour."
,,Good Tours,4.0,,Command center of the Allied in the second world war. Nice tours with lovely guides. Tour took about 1 hours and 30 minutes. It is abit of a bummer that you can not explore on your own. I felt seldomly a bit rushed during the tour.
,,Battlebox tour,5.0,,"Equal to any tour I have ever been on. Our guide Kamaliah was brilliant. Informative, humorous and articulate. A most enjoyable couple of hours. A tour to remember. Thank you Kevin Ord"
,,A must see historical attraction,5.0,,"Simply a must see to understand what happened during the war. The best WWII historical site that I've visited in Singapore.

Positives
- our tour guide Mel was great. Humorous, knowledgeable and unbiased in her sharing of information
- the tour has a great deal of history on display (not just the Battlebox history but also other important battles during WWII)
- learnt a lot more about the invasion of the Japanese and what really happened
- it was great to be able to walk around the bunkers and be in the rooms where the action took place.
- you can also walk around the other building on the site to give you a real sense of history
- the shop had a lot of different books and historical information that you could purchase

Negatives
- the tour group was a little large and it was hard to see everything in the rooms because of this.
- on a Sunday the grounds on the site (not the museum) seem to attract a lot of groups of young people. They were drinking alcohol, smoking and playing loud music. A little disrespectful. There should be some policing of this."
,,A must see!,5.0,,We decided to visit the Battlebox on a rainy afternoon and were not disappointed! The guided tour was superb as was the guide and it was really quite moving when you hear the story of what those men went through and how they must have felt.
,,Excellent Guided Tour,5.0,,"We thought we'd try it again after first visiting in 2010 and we noticed the improvement. Mel, the guide was superb and thoroughly recommended. Well done"
,,Great for WW2 history buffs,5.0,,Lots of interesting information about this important place in Singaporean World War 2 history. Couldn't take photos which was a little disappointing but definitely received lots of facts and a sense for what it might have been like to be underground during war time.
,,Battlebox,4.0,,"Had some spare time in Singapore and signed up for ""The Battle Box Experience"" The tour was excellent and our guide Aysha did a great job of setting out the history behind the surrender of Singapore. Well worth your time and it's air conditioned!"
,,Interesting Tour,5.0,,"Interesting to see this underground bunker from WWII, lovely gardens too while we waited for our tour. Our young tour guide Eisen was very knowledgeable and entertaining."
,,Fascinating history,4.0,,"very interesting and enjoyable tour -- a lot of detail and ground to cover in the allocated time which made it difficult to cover all of the material. Would like to have heard more about the aftermath and consequences of the surrender - such as the Sook Ching massacre, as well as the role of Dalforce, an irregular formation recruited from the local Chinese population, and the exploits of the Malayan Regiment at Bukit Timah."
,,"History, History",4.0,,"If you are an ex Vet or interested in WWII, then this is the place to visit. Old British HQ from WWII. See how they lived and worked in cramped quarters underground"
,,Very good for WWII history buffs.,4.0,,"We took a guided tour of ""Battle Box"" with is the bunker complex the British used before the fall of Singapore in 1942. Our guide was very enthusiastic and well versed regarding what occurred in that complex leading up to the British surrender. Interesting and well worth the visit."
,,A 'Must Visit' Museum,5.0,,"We visited the Battlebox, during our brief stay in Singapore just a few days ago.
We are so glad we did. Our guide was brilliant, and the video footage was so informative. It was well worth the entrance fee, and could have spent longer in the bunker reading the information that was placed around there. Afterwards, a visit to the coffee shop there for a spot of lunch, set us up for looking around the park during the afternoon. Lovely outdoor space."
,,Great look at WWII Singapore,4.0,,Touring the Brit's underground command post ... what a neat way to learn about the Malay campaign and the fall of Singapore! It's also a nice way to cool off from the heat & humidity.
,,First class! A must visit.,5.0,,"Excellent information about the circumstances leading to the Battle of Singapore in WW2 and the surrender by the British to the Japanese - an event described by Churchill as ""The worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history.""
That's all well and good but the decision faced by the commander's was definitely No Win.
Really quite emotional and leaves you pondering the alternative outcome for both military and civilians had the decision been to launch a counter offensive with so much stacked against them.
Excellent guide, Ayesha, who was very knowledgeable and enabled us to relive the course of history. Tour lasted 90 mins.
This is a privately owned facility and well worth supporting at a modest tour cost of S$18."
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,"We had Mel for our tour guide. She was brilliant, well informed and highly intelligent. The Battlebox is a well thought out museum and provides all the information one needs. I believe one day it will be a self guided tour, but being with a guide gives so much more insight. I would recommend to any one with a WW2 interest."
,,Al;an and Sue's Singapore trip,4.0,,Very informative. Guide was excellent - very informed and extremely interesting. Being from the UK It was good to know how the English were so unprepared !!
,,must see,5.0,,"There is nothing more to say than everybody should see it, it is part of history and very well presented."
,,Best WWII Tour of All Time,5.0,,This tour is for the true military history fan. When I returned back to my ship I raved about the tour to my fellow Officers and Enlisted alike. Just absolutely loved it. It was a very optimal tour. The guide gave a brief background on Singapore leading into the war and then dove into all details of the historical events surrounding the bunker and the war itself. He went onto the details of the personalities involved as well as other subtleties as a military service member myself I was absolutely fascinated with. Very very interesting.
,,Interesting insight,5.0,,"Jerome was our guide and he was very knowledgeable and well spoken. The tour was interesting and gave an insight into the last days leading to the Fall of Singapore as well as touching on the history of the island city. We did the 1 hour tour and found it excellent.

The park surrounding the Battlebox is lovely and also worth a wonder."
,,revie of battlebox Singapore,4.0,,"I really enjoyed my tour of the Battlebox site. The guide was very informative and interesting. The only downside was that we were not allowed to take photos. So I only have memories of the tour. It would have been good to receive a pamphlet or glossy photo handout. So I can only relay my experience to my friends and not show them how authentic it was.
regards"
,,A valuable tour with very knowledgable guides,5.0,,"I'd recommmend this tour to anyone visiting Singapore, including those who are not usually interested in history. It will be worth your while."
,,Interesting WW!! historical experience,5.0,,"As my father was a POW of the Japanese at the fall of Singapore in February 1941, this was of particular interest to me. The site has been recently restored, so quite a lot of rooms to see on the one hour tour. Need to arrive well ahead of the tour start time as it is very popular, and there are strict restrictions on the group numbers. You can walk around Fort Canning Park whilst you wait; that is also interesting.
I was already aware of the WW11 facts, but it was good to see the context so closely. Also child friendly."
,,An excellent historical museum,5.0,,A very nice and impressive historical museum. I've been there twice and not hesitate to recommend others to visit. They should limit the no. of people per round as some rooms are quite small.
,,Superb piece of little known history,5.0,,We were on the fence about this tour but went on a recommendation. It didn't disappoint. Learnt a lot from our very informative and passionate guide who was ex-amry. Thoroughly recommended (even the doubting girlfriend liked it!)
,,Tour,5.0,,This was an amazing and informative tour much of the information I had never heard before Eisen was fantastic
,,Wonderful Experience!!,5.0,,"This was particularly informative due to the host, it was very moving, taking us back in time to see how the people of Singapore endured the war & the extreme decisions forced to made by the 12 men on behalf of the country."
,,Fort canning battlebox,5.0,,"The tour was fascinating. All explained by the guide in such an excellent manner. She knew all the facts, and portrayed them in a clear, thorough and comprehensive manner. Anyone remotely interested in history must visit the battlebox."
,,Slice of history,5.0,,Definitely make time for this guided tour of the Battlebox at Fort Canning Park. I quickly realized as the tour started how little I knew of the war in this region and the subsequent surrender to the Japanese. A must visit and humbling experience.
,,Surprising Discovery,5.0,,The guided tour (by Kamalal) makes this already-good museum better. One feels as if he has stepped into those moments in history when the decision to surrender was made. A must-go if you are here in Singapore (and I say this to Singaporeans too!).
,,Walking through history,5.0,,"I had the chance to join the tour through battlebox to learn about the fall of singapore, particularly on how the British defended Singapore.
Its fully air conditioned, english speaking tour guides, wax figurines inside, good videos to enhance your tour.
However do take note no photography inside"
,,Battlebox,5.0,,The Battlebox is well worth a visit when in Singapore. The tour guide was excellent in his knowledge and the films viewed fantastic. Also the mock displays very well done.Many Thanks for a great visit.
,,Great history lesson,5.0,,"The tour took 1,5h. The guide (Eisen Teo) was very energetic and engaging. The history of the battle was presented in a very interesting way. A must for all history-lovers."
,,A unique way to make history come alive,5.0,,"I hear of World War II from my grandparents and parents (who were children during that time). Battlebox provides a closer perspective of what one aspect of life was like during that time - this time from the view of the commanders who decided to surrender Singapore to Japan. Right now (Feb 2017) you have to join a tour to be able to go in the bunkers, but there are plans later on to allow self-guided tours. I see the value though, in having a guide lead you through the place initially, as there are historical stories that I appreciate more when told in person, rather than from reading a description or listening to an audio guide. There are specific times for the tour, so it's best to check if they have slots for when you want to visit, as some days may be busy. I went on a weekend, and only the short tour was available. There is a longer tour that they do on weekdays.

It is in Fort Canning park, also a good place to visit to take a breather from urban Singapore. Battlebox is right next to Fort Canning Hotel, you get your tickets from the Battlebox Visitor Center."
,,A fascinating insight into the events leading up to the surrender of Singapore 1942,5.0,,"Our tour guide, Jerome, was articulate and knowledgable. You could read all this in a book I guess, but actually being there brings it right to your doorstep. I have been to Singapore many times and regret not having done this trip before. History in the making, a history that we should all understand. Watch the BBC documentary The Fall of Singapore The Great Betrayal either before or after."
,,Realities of war captured in an informative short tour.,4.0,,"Although the bunker was stripped of its contents just before the Japanese entered the city in 1942, the bare underground rooms still evoke the nightmare of imminent and inevitable defeat which led to the surrender of Singapore. Some of the rooms are now populated with waxworks of the British and Australian commanders and various other ranks, convincing enough to add to our well-informed and enthusiastic tour guide's knowledge. We visited Battlebox particularly because it would be dry on a very rainy day, but it is well worth seeing at any time."
,,historical site,5.0,,"Recently opened, this site is an interesting place to visit. The tour takes about 40 minutes but the guide was excellent and engaged the group with accurate, historical recount of the last days before surrender in World War II. It is planned that the site will eventually be a self guided tour but at the moment you need to book a tour. Located close to the National Museum which I highly recommend you also visit."
,,A sobering change from the glitz of Singapore,4.0,,"Battlebox is an underground bunker used by senior officers of the British army in WW2, and was the place where the decision was taken to surrender to the Japanese. Our guide Jerome was very informative and enthusiastic about the subject. For my husband, it was the highlight of our visit to Singapore, and for me it was a few moments to remember the thousands of people who were killed and suffered in the conflict only a few decades ago."
,,An absolute must in Singapore,5.0,,"We will be recommending The Battlebox to all of our visitors coming to stay in Singapore.

The museum in Fort Canning Park is well worth the visit. The site of the fateful decision to surrender to the Japanese Imperial Army. Probably the best museum of its type we've visited anywhere (and we've done a lot!!). The recently reopened war rooms are very well presented however the guides are fabulous. Anu our guide really knew her stuff and got a brilliant balance of historic facts and human interest and context. Our visit was even more poignant as we were there for the 75 anniversary of the fall of Singapore.

The whole Fort Canning area is steeped in history and a lovely peaceful place for a change of pace and a haven for nature overlooking the city.

For a real perspective on the catalyst for modern Singapore, Churchill's war and for a remarkably realistic experience of the war rooms - visit."
,,A must if you're interested in history of WWII,5.0,,"You can only visit as part of a guided tour at set times so check up before visiting. They were closed on Monday morning when we first tried to visit. The tour is about 90 minutes and explains the background to the invasion by Japan and subsequent allied surrender. Our guide, Jerome, was superb, making the tour both fun and informative. A very important period of history and certainly worth a visit"
,,Great day at Fort Canning,5.0,,"Really enjoyed a great afternoon at Fort Canning and at the Battlebox. A must for any history or military enthusiast or simply someone interested in Singapore's fascinating history.
Joanne was our tour guide and was great. She made it interesting and fun at all times and had a good knowledge of events and dates and all that the tourist and visitor needed, Thanks Joanne."
,,You will walk away with an appreciation for what happened here,5.0,,"This tour is absolutely worth doing. I have done the tour twice. Once when it first reopened with my family (kids 8 and 13). Everyone enjoyed it. It was great to see how it connected to all the happenings in different parts of the world at that time. Many events affected the outcome of the war here. I went a second time with visitors recently and enjoyed it even more. The guests were very impressed with the tour and the information given. The re-creation of the people involved is so well done.
I heard that they may discontinue the guided tours and make it a self guided tour instead. I think this would be a mistake. Part of the appeal is that the tour guide takes you along through history, telling you the story of what happened. It is a relaxing easy tour and you walk away with more knowledge than if you simply walked through reading plaques. I would happily bring any visitors to Singapore we have, though if it becomes a self guided tour I would hesitate. We could get the same information walking through a museum reading. I recommend this tour for anyone, even if history is not your thing. I do hope they continue the guided tours as this is no ordinary museum. It should be kept special by ensuring there are guides to teach everyone who visits so they walk away with a memorable experience."
,,A Must Visit,5.0,,Take this guided tour to learn about probably the most important moment in Singapore's history. The tour is very well presented and takes you through the days of the Japanese invasion and occupation with a tour of the tunnels accompanied by a knowledgeable guide. This is history that should not be forgotten and is presented in a very understandable way. It takes about one and a half hours
,,Fascinating insight into the agony of defeat,5.0,,"For anyone interested in the history of Singapore or of World War II, this tour is fascinating - a tour of the inner workings of Fort Canning, and the cumulative failures and poor decision making that ultimately led to the surrender of Singapore and the deaths of so many military personnel and civilians.

A sad story indeed, but one that is remembered and marked by Singapore, and rightly so. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and charming, and it was all in all an hour well spent."
,,A story of the World War II in the region.,3.0,,"Very skilled staff clearly describing how the world war II was fought in the region. The Battlebox is the underground bunker where the efforts in Singapore was planned during the war. Location is good so this is a good place to learn something new for a few hours. It is a fairly new attraction that can be compared to Churchill War Room in London, but much more as it was back then. i,e no multimedia."
,,Sobering reminder of the Sngapore past,5.0,,"tour very good, covering all parts of the battle box, goes for about 80minutes, great guide and allow time to walk around Fort Canning after"
,,Outstanding,5.0,,Our guide Eisen was very knowledgeable and friendly. This is a fascinating place and the tour was well worth the money. I wouldn't have had the same experience without a tour
,,amazing history,5.0,,what a tour. amazing insight into a seminal event in world history. Very knowledgeable guide with a military background. Look forward to self guided tour in the future where you can spend more time
,,A great exhibit and tour,5.0,,This is a fantastic activity if you are interested in the history of the surrender of British forces to the Japanese in Singapore in 1942. Very professionally put together with a knowledgeable guide. The life-like figures on display in the various rooms of the underground military HQ were impressive in adding to the story. Thoroughly recommend it (I did the 1 and 1/4 hour one)
,,Highlight of recent Singapore visit,5.0,,"Why have I not visited here before - what a great museum! I thought I knew a bit about the Japanese occupation of Singapore in WW2 but this taught me so much more in such an interactive environment.
Our guide Jerome was excellent - such a well run attraction! Loved walking around peaceful Fort Canning as well."
,,Surrender explained,5.0,,"The Battlebox was the wartime British military HQ where the decision was made to surrender to the Japanese invading Singapore. Our guide Mel was superb in detailing the role of the underground bunker in the lead up to the surrender. Videos also explained the invasion of the Malay peninsula, the Japanese military and tactical superiority and the eventual surrender. It was a fascinating account of Singapore's darkest hour. The tour lasts about 80 minutes and is definitely recommended."
,,Excellent Tour - Excellent Tour Guide,5.0,,This was my first tour of a Bunker. The experience was excellent! Not just the tour itself but our tour guide - Eisen! He was so knowledgable and more than willing and capable to answer questions and offer additional information. I would highly recommend this tour and highly recommend Eisen! : )
,,brilliant,5.0,,"Visited here during our recent stay and so glad we did. Very interesting and our guide Sharul was excellent. It is quite a walk up steep areas at times through the ort canning park. we visited as part o the hop on hop of bus which stopped near by. This was a great visit, but check the tour times prior to arriving as they only allow guided tours at set times."
,,Fort Canning Battlebox,5.0,,"This is really worth the entrance fee, it is only accessible via a guided tour and if you know nothing of the WWII history of Singapore then this is the tour for you. The tour company has done an incredible job in restoring the bunker."
,,Battle Box Tour,5.0,,With out this tour I would not have achieved the same level of insight into the fall of Singapore. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in Second World war history.
,,Very informative guided tour,5.0,,"A very extensive and friendly guided tour! Highly recommended! Apparently recently taken over and reopening for visitors to roam but tour highly recommended! Our guide Mel was brilliant, enthusiastic and answered all our questions"
,,Must-Visit Historic Fortress - Great Experience,5.0,,"The Battlebox is the place to visit to better appreciate Singapore’s history and why the fall of Singapore was inevitable. After my visit, I had a better appreciation of the Battle of Singapore and what the Allied forces went through. It is also a good place to learn about the history of Singapore, not just on the Battle of Singapore but also on the era of the Malay kings going back 700 years. A must-visit for both locals and foreigners."
,,Tour of a historic underground military fortress,4.0,,"Each tour group is lead by a docent who explains the history of the British Army's command center in Singapore. In the individual rooms are wax figures representing the generals who were doomed to surrender the island to the Japanese. It is a sobering experience, knowing the claustrophobic conditions that existed in the underground fortress and the horrific fate that awaits the men in captivity.

This museum is a little Spartan because there are not a lot of artifacts, such as the types of weapons, the food, pictures and diaries from soldiers, etc. from that period. Instead, the displays revolve around the different rooms and their functions. Nevertheless, this is an OK tour because of its uniqueness and importance in WWII."
,,Absolutely brilliant,5.0,,Our tour gave an incredible insight into the frustrations and ultimate failure of the WWII effort against Japan. Incredibly knowledgeable and entertaining tour guide (Shar?) who brought the tale to life with anecdotes and historical facts. Highly recommended.
,,Best thing in Singapore..,5.0,,Really enjoyed this tour. Guides were so passionate and informative. Everybody should visit! The history can be relevant to all nationalities as a major kingpin to the rise and fall of World War 2
,,Must see historic fortress!,5.0,,"This was a wonderful one hour tour that went into the details of Singapore's fate during World War II. The visit was dynamic and while it was sad that we couldn't take pictures inside, it just meant we had more time to focus on the artifacts and image displays around. Definitely recommend!"
,,Singapore,5.0,,"A cool option on a hot day in Singapore. Just a 15minute walk from Clarks Quay is this 11World War underground bunker used during the siege of Singapore.. Check tours times , in January they were, 11a.m. and 1.30.The tour takes about an hour and a half"
,,20 steps to the Fall of an Empire,4.0,,"I had been to the Battle Box in its previous incarnation... beyond the wax figures and the rusting bunker, the feeling for those with a nose for monumental moments in history is one of eerie reflection. In this tiny doomed subterranean command centre - the decision to surrender not only Fortress Singapore, but unintentionally begin the unraveling of the entire British Empire - weighs heavy on its moulding, silent walls. I would strongly combining this trip with a follow up - The Ford Factory at Bukit Timah road - where Percival finally agreed to the surrender to his Japanese peer. Obviously to complete the story circle i would also include Changi prison museum, and the surrender chamber at City Hall. I must say the recent tour I took - was very good. I was very impressed with the knowledge of our tour guide."
,,It's a must!,5.0,,Very interesting and exciting. We enjoyed it a lot. Charul is a fantastic guide. We learned a lot. It's really worth the money and unforgetable.
,,Great guided tour,5.0,,"Interesting to know there is this place in Fort Caning and I recommend tourists and Singaporean do pay a visit to this wonderful historical place with guided tour.
Our guide Iesen a very knowledgeable guide who does the tour with a passion. We enjoyed the guided tour thoroughly and I highly recommend this tour to local and tourists."
,,Historically Enriching Tour,5.0,,"This is a must for WW2/history enthusiasts. The tour covered the early history of Singapore leading to its colonial downfall to the Japanese during WW2. The site has been well preserved and refurbished, with scenes recreating the key players and moments, for an authentic experience of what it must have been like during those days of impending dread. More rewarding is the guided tour which imparts much more than it could otherwise. My guide Ms Kamaliah made the tour much more memorable with her knowledge and enthusiasm on the subject matter and more informative with additional nuggets of little known facts. Well worth the entrance fee for a important piece of Singapore and the region's history."
,,Glad we found it,5.0,,"It is a bit of a climb from the nearest MTR (train) station to the entrance of this ""museum"" but well worth the effort.

We arrived early for the 9.45am tour and were fortunate that there were only 6 others on the tour with us.
Our guide had clearly done his homework and spent plenty of time in each room explaining its significance.
This was interspersed with short movies from the period (1940's) showing what was actually taking place.

Apparently in the near future the tour will be self-guided; hopefully they retain the guides to better explain what you are looking at."
,,"Well done, informative, personalised experience",5.0,,"This sounded interesting and a bit different and so it was.
The story of the British surrender to the Japanese in 1942 told by a well informed young guide as you wander in a small group from room to room through the underground command centre. There is plenty time during the tour to ask questions and afterwards the guides will revisit with you to allow closer inspection or give more in depth information. As well as the physical building they have gathered a few historical artefacts, mostly reproductions which add colour to the story."
,,Great Tour,5.0,,"We visited the Battlebox in 2001 and pleased to see that it had been renovated last year. This time we had to join a to a tour, which was very informative presented by a docent who knew her subject."
,,Fascinating place to visit,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Battlebox this week. Jerome gave us a fascinating tour, which was very informative and demonstrated his passion and knowledge of the bunker and the history behind it. The bunker was more extensive than we realised and the scenes created in some of the rooms brought its history to life. Would highly recommend a visit."
,,"Bicycle Infantry, tiny tanks and so much more... A must see!",5.0,,"Having visited the Battlebox before the renovation, I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was a pleasant surprise and I learned so much more. it's been renovated with great integrity and the team is full of energy, knowledge and passion. Our tour with Eisen lasted around 75 minutes and was very worthwhile. It immersed us in the history, strategy and the main players, taking us on a journey through the fall of Singapore in WW2 and beyond. The tour uses mixed media, so the pace is good, but it's also relaxed in terms of Q&A. Although I've said below you can enter without advance booking, it's best to check tour times as they're limited, but on-line booking help is available. Well worth a visit, even if you've been before."
,,Interesting tour,5.0,,"This tour was fantastic. It was so informative, our guide Sharul was a mine of information and really brought the history to life. This tour gives the full background to the lead up to the Japanese occupation of Singapore and provided us with a great understanding of the situation and how it happened. Using original film footage from the time. The tour is well laid out and the restoration to the 'bunker' has been carried out very sympathetically. You get an idea of what it must have been like for the people working there. I highly recommend this tour to any visitors or residents of Singapore who haven't been."
,,A fantastic history of the fall of Singapore in WW2,5.0,,The fall of Singapore to the Japanese in WW2. Remains a controversial topic even today. For any one who is interested in the largest defeat in British history. One of their guided tours of the English WW2 Singapore headquarters will give you a comprehensive understanding of the English politics that allowed it to happen.
,,Marvellously interesting,5.0,,"My husband was most keen to visit the Battlebox but I wasn't and so (I'm now ashamed to say!) I took my Kindle. What an idiot! Such a brilliant tour and more interesting and informative that I would ever had believed. When we visited you could only do so as part of a very informal tour. But we were told that they are making changes and visitors will be able to make their own way around in the near future. My advice would be absolutely to have a guide. Generally I prefer to make my own way around places; here, though, it would be a mistake. Our guide, Eisen, is beyond brilliant. He's immensely knowledgeable and delivered that knowledge in the way of a good book - you just wanted to keep on hearing the next sentence and the next and....... On top of that, instead of being a crusty old historian, he's young and full of enormous enthusiasm. I think the tours go at 11a.m. and around 2 in the afternoon. We didn't book and although we did easily get onto the morning tour, we discovered it's probably best to do so."
,,Very Worthwhile Visit,5.0,,My wife and I booked a visit at the end of January and thoroughly enjoyed the guided tour. Our female guide was very knowledgeable and very enthusiastic in her delivery. She gave an insight into both sides of the conflict and provided a better understanding of the decisions reached. This coupled with the tour of the Battlebox and seeing the artifacts and realistic figures proved to be a tremendous experience.
,,"Very interesting, great history.",5.0,,"Saw the Battle Box as part of one of the brilliant The Original Singapore Walks tours. Well worth visiting, great work to present this by local historians and organisations."
,,Memorable,5.0,,We wanted to go and visit unfortunately they only opened phase 1 only but we had fun learning about Singapore's History and at the end of the tour there was a quiz and we won the copy of the declaration of independence. The tour guide was very informative and friendly she really knows how to keep our attention from drifting away.
,,Battlebox - Awesome,5.0,,The guide was excellent. This part of WWII history was worth visiting. Highly recommended to all the tourists who are planning to visit Singapore or who are currently in Singapore.
,,Great history in the middle of the city,5.0,,This is an interesting and historical site to visit with a very informative 1 hour walking tour through the underground war rooms and facilities. Good value for money.
,,Great couple of hours in the Battelbox,5.0,,A really interesting couple of hours in Fort Canning Park and the Battlebox. It gave us food for thought on our understanding of the surrender of Singapore and totally developed our understanding. Excellent and knowledgeable tour guide. Thoroughly recommended whether you are into military history or not!
,,A step back in time.,5.0,,"Anyone into their history, particularly events of WWII, should definitely check out the Battlebox at Fort Canning. The staff are very well informed and the tour guides are brilliant!
Listen careful for there's usually a quiz at the end of the 90min tour that could win you a special gift.
I consider the Battlebox to be on par with the War Rooms in London. Do check it out and support the up keep of these national treasures."
,,Best thing on our trip,5.0,,"Our trip to the Battlebox was the most interesting of all the places we visited on our one week stay in Singapore. It's a good balance of listening, watching short videos and seeing around the bunker. Our guide was great to listen to and I learnt so much about the fall of Singapore from her. I would definitely recommend the Battlebox to anyone visiting Singapore."
,,Excellent historical review,5.0,,A guided tour of the bunkers where the Singapore surrender of British to the Japanese in WWII. Old videos from both sides and good replicas of the bunkers. Guide was very knowledgeable.
,,Battle box,5.0,,"We had no plan to visit but met a couple in the park who suggested it to us. Our guide, Shar - I think - was excellent and he really made the tour come alive. We were in the bunker for nearly 90 minutes and the whole experience was first class. I suggest that the museum keeps its guided tours going. I believe that they are changing it to a self guided visit."
,,The Turner Family,5.0,,"A very emotional tour of the battlebox for me as my father became a POW after the Japanese invasion. He survived, but it affected his whole life right up until his dying day.

The tour was excellent, and I totally recommend the 2 hours of the best history lesson you could ask for."
,,Worthwhile visiting,5.0,,"We got the idea to visit Battlebox from Trip Advisor, and it was great. Our guide Jerome was extremely knowledgeable and engaging. Well worth the entrance fee. We can highly recommend."
,,Battlebox,5.0,,A must visit for any visitor to Singapore the tour guide was very knowledgeable and took treat pride in explaining the history of the battlebox and Singapore.
,,Chris & Jacqui,5.0,,"Excellent history lesson, very good presentation, explains why they had no choice but surrender, lucky that the decision was not just left to the English!!"
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"Have just returned from a tour of the Battle Box in Fort Canning Park with my two children. We were lucky to have an extremely personable and knowledgeable guide in Sharul who made this experience really memorable. He described the significance of the Hill, long before the arrival of the British and gave compelling account of the fall of Singapore and its aftermath, commenting on the different strategies employed by the British and the Japanese. I thoroughly recommend this tour to those seeking to learn more about the rich history of Singapore."
,,Enriching experience,5.0,,"A great insight, authentic relics and a great tour guide. Kudos to Mr Jerome for his wonderful explanation and clear voice."
,,Very good presentation,5.0,,"If you are a WWII buff, this is not to be missed. Good presentation with a knowledgeable guide. Also a great way to get out of the Singapore heat for a bit (its air conditioned.)"
,,Historical Fun,4.0,,"It's hard to find things to do as a Singaporean parent to satisfy the insatiable curiosity of my 7 and 5-year olds and we happened to be strolling around Fort Canning when we stumbled upon the poster for Battlebox. There are fixed timings to the tour, so you might want to check out their website to avoid disappointment. There's the 1-hour Battlebox tour and the 2.5 hours Battlebox and Fort Canning tour. My son is big on WWII stuff now so we brought him for his birthday and we had real fun. Our guide, Joanne, was friendly and informative and addressed the questions of his curious audience, which mostly consisted of Caucasian tourists. We took a short 3-minute walk to the start of the air-conditioned tunnels. It's definitely not a tour for screaming kids or those who might be inclined to claustrophobia. The tour was a mixture of presentation by Joanne and watching three videos. The best part of the tour was the parts of the tunnels which were from the time of the war (doors which were sliced to allow for more ventilation, Japanese writing etched on the wall, a generator of sorts). There are a lot of realistic wax sculptures and interesting production design to recreate the final days of WWII. Our guide told us about how they might be changing it to allow for a self-guided tour, though I kind of like the personal human-element of the tour. I craved more WWII artefacts to be on displayed within the tunnels. There's a nice store which sells interesting books at the end of the tour. I bought a thick book on The Fall of Singapore and two other books for my son, but I think I'm enjoying the books as much as he is."
,,Guided tour,5.0,,"The tours are at specific times and dates. The tours are given by local history experts, they are excellent and very informative. I would seriously not take young children - under 8 as they may not endure the 1.5/2 hour tour. We had a couple on our tour and they were bored and noisy."
,,Interesting historical tour,4.0,,"A 90 minute, comprehensive interesting tour of the Battlebox. We took our kids (aged 7-10yrs) and they managed to be attentive for most of the tour. Great to get into the bunker and get a feel for the command centre."
,,1 hour guided tour,5.0,,Worth work up hill Enthusiastic guide well informed Good clear boards Reconstructions with lifelike figures very well maintained highly recommended if you are interested in WW2
,,Hidden gem,5.0,,"What a lovely few hours spend with my family at the Battlebox. It is located in a beautiful park surrounded by lots of greenery. We were thoroughly entertained while being educated on the history and journey Singapore had to go through during the II World War. Our boys ages 5, 10, 16 all enjoyed the experience and was always captured by the presentation. The guide was very informative and did a really good job at retelling this very important history lesson. Will definitely recommend this tour."
,,Excellent Tour,5.0,,"Eisen was our tour guide and he knew everything about the local, regional and global history related to the battlebox. He told the story in a very intriguingj, captivating and interesting way, which i really appreciated as a History teacher. My friend was not a history geek like me but she also loved the museum so much, she ended up asking more questions than me, which Eisen answered patiently and attentively. One more thing, call in advance because there are scheduled tours, you must see museum as a tour but its really worth it."
,,A must see historic site,5.0,,"The attraction is a guided tour inside the bunkers of Fort Canning. It seems to play a very important place in Singapore's history.

This is a well paced tour with a wealth of information. You will be taken into the bunkers and the various rooms and the uses are shown. A number of important photos and videos are interspersed to give a lot of information to guests.

Not many locals seemed to be visiting the place, (probably since it is new). If you are a history buff, you will love this. Our guide Eisen was very friendly and knowledgeable.

-Photography and videography is not allowed.
-You have to stand/walk for about an hour, comfortable footwear should be preferred."
,,It's a must see. Top marks!!,5.0,,"Came across Battlebox on TripAdvisor with already good ratings so had to see for myself. My knowledge is very limited when it comes to the World Wars but I walked away knowing so much.
Our tour guide Shar was brilliant. Not only did he deliver a well presented tour of the bunker, he was also funny & has a military background with a great understanding into the tactics used.
The whole thing was fascinating, sad & gave me a great insight into Singapore's history during the war.
For the price it's worth every cent & I urge everyone visiting or even living here to go visit Battlebox."
,,Interesting and informative!,5.0,,Our guide was very helpful. I would have liked a little more time to view the pictures and other information inside.
,,A very interesting tour,5.0,,My husband is very knowledgeable about war history and I joined him on the tour of the Battlebox not knowing what to expect It was very interesting and very well presented by our guide
,,Fascinating visit,5.0,,"I've been living in Singapore 3 years now and this had been closed for refurbishment until recently. Brilliant, as with all the WW2 exhibitions in SG (Ford Factory, Changi Chapel etc) the guides are passionate about the subject matter and really get the story across.

We had Japanese on our tour and the guide was both sensitive and didn't pull any punches... brilliant job!

She was sympathetic to Percival as well which as a Brit was good... Perhaps she was being sensitive to us as well!

Great place, shame the bar in the hotel next door is so disappointing (Fort Canning Hotel)"
,,The Battlebox,5.0,,Absolutely fascinating. A bit of history that was completely unknown to me. Very knowledgeable people. Beautifully presented artefacts.
,,Battlebox--An eye into the past,5.0,,"For a North American, the tour gave insight into a part of the war that many of us have not been exposed to. By going into the bunker, room by room, some with reenactments, some with photo displays, accompanied by a guide providing perspective, we were thoroughly engaged. Heartily recommend this attraction.."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,Those who think Singapore is nothing but shiny new Marina Bay and Orchard Rd think again. The brutal but fascinating past of Singapore is something all visitors (and locals) should learn about. And Battle Box makes learning graphic (you're in the actual bunkers where the Allied command was based) and interesting with expert tour guides
,,A Very Worthwhile Experience,5.0,,"We (two adults and a fifteen year old) recently went on the Battlebox tour and found it to be a really interesting, well-presented tour. Our guide (Bel) was extremely knowledgeable and presented detailed historical information in an interesting way. A lot of care has been taken to make this exhibition interesting and engaging (information boards, life-like models of key people involved in the decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese and good audio-visuals). The tour was well paced and I liked the way Bel kept the presentation moving (sometimes these tours are dominated by visitors asking a lot of questions - Bel invited anyone who was interested to go back into the bunker after the tour to read the information boards and ask questions). My whole family thoroughly enjoyed this tour; it was interesting, informative and very well presented, as well as being comfortable (air conditioned and with seats for when you were watching one of the short videos). The organisation responsible for this presentation has done a wonderful job and apparently has plans to continue to develop it. I would thoroughly recommend this tour for anyone ( with the exception perhaps of very young children)."
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,This was a very interesting place to visit and not a lot of people know about it. The guide was very good and told us a lot of how Singapore fell and what the army was doing. You can also have a walk round the grounds and also stay in the old Army headquarters which is now a hotel.
,,A Fantastic place to visit . Incredibly insightful and educational tour. A must !!!,5.0,,"We visited the Battlebox following a cruise that we had been on. We had 4 days in Singapore and this was high on our list of things to do. I particularly enjoy military history. The visit did not disappoint. The guide was excellent and she was incredibly knowledgeable on the subject. It I fascinating to visit this underground command centre constructed under Fort Canning,as an emergency, bomb-proof command centre during the Malayan Campaign and the Battle of Singapore.If you remotely like military history then this is a must for you. Highly recommended ."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Our tour leader, Joanne, was excellent, the tour is definitely worth taking. Learned so much about the surrender of Singapore. Good for adults and children."
,,Educationally Wonderful!,5.0,,"Our tour guide was EXCELLENT. We were lucky to have only 3 in our tour group. She answered all of our questions and we had great conversations. It was just amazing that this place existed, and still exists! And the grounds were beautiful as well! Also, the man in the shop was very helpful and nice when we were asking questions even before the tour! LOVED IT! May be our favorite stop in Singapore!"
,,Tour of Battlebox,5.0,,excellent tour guide and good explanation as well as know the subject very well . We learn a lot about the battlebox and Singapore history
,,Aussie History Lover,4.0,,I did the tour ten years ago and the highlight was the audio of the conversation in the command room about whether to surrender or not. This was the main thing I was looking forward to and it is no longer a part of the tour. Very disappointed. Rest was as I remembered it. Lovely guides and very professional. Well worth a visit.
,,Informative and captivating,5.0,,We stumbled across this tour and we are so glad we did. It was the highlight of our trip. Our guide was informative and extremely helpful. Such an interesting history the battle pbox holds.
,,Interesting and very accurate,5.0,,"Interesting tour inside a bunker of WW2 with original furniture. Videos and. above all, lots of informations and explainations about war in these part of World"
,,Time well spent at Fort Canning,5.0,,"The guided tour is definitely a great excursion. Our guide Eisen, was extremely knowledgeable and an excellent communicator. For many of us in the west, we lack education on what happende in this part of the World during WWII. Visits to places such as Ft. Canning serve as valuable opportunities to expand our knowledge and understanding of this most important time in History."
,,Super overview of WW2 events in Singapore,5.0,,"Explores the HQ bunkers but does much more . Excellent guide (Sha) who had fantastic knowledge and real enthusiasm. Uses a mixture of film and talks and scenes to bring the events to life from before the war, through surrender and eventual war end. Highly recommend - 1.25 hours well spent"
,,One of the best,5.0,,Our guide was Jerome. He was so knowledgeable and answered all our questions. This has to be one of the best historical tours we have been on. Only wish it was longer.
,,Well worth it.,5.0,,Put this on your list of places to visit whilst in Singapore. Jerome was an excellent guide and it was a fascinating tour of the underground bunker where the fate of Singapore in WWII was decided. 7 of us went there and even those without a military background (including my kids) had an enjoyable time. Highly recommended
,,The Battlebox - a hidden gem,5.0,,On business in Singapore and had a free weekend and stumbled across this - read the posters and thought 'why not?'. I'm glad I did. It was a great experience if you want to get some WWII history. The hosts were great and the tour is a good mix of verbal and visual communication. Took over an hour so good value for money. If you are passing by why not ask 'why not'.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"As a Singaporean living overseas for so many years, I have never been to Fort canning nor investigated the history behind this area.

I found our guide very informative and certainly educated us about the vast history buried under the fort.

Would certainly recommend this tour to anyone coming to Singapore."
,,"Super interesting, thoroughly engaging!",5.0,,"This tour was definitely the highlight of our visit. Our tour guide, Sharru, was terrific. I understand eventually the bunker will be restored to allow unguided tours -- please don't! Without the guide it's just another destination/museum. You would be missing out on the enthusiasm and excitement that comes with a knowledgeable tour guide like Sharru who understands the military and Singapore's terrain. We even bought a history book and can't wait to learn more about Singapore!"
,,Really interesting,5.0,,"I've been to Singapore 4 times now and visited all the museums here but this tour is different. This gives you a detailed explanation of Fort Canning, it's use in Singapore's history and the role of Battlebox during WW11. The tour lasted an hour and half. There were approx 30 people on our Saturday tour of all ages. Young to old. Everyone was kept interested. Well worth a visit if you are interested in this sort of thing. The Battlebox is fully air conditioned and has no confined spaces in case you are worried. At one point in time the Battlebox held 500 men so a tour group of 30 is no challenge. Really enjoyed it!"
,,Great little Tour,5.0,,I enjoyed learning about this and hearing the story of Singapore during the second world war and the Japanese invasion
,,fantastic historical Tour,5.0,,"We have done the tour in the past, prior to renovation and it is now better than ever. Our guide had an outstanding knowledge of the fall of singapore, and was extremely informative- highly recommended"
,,Brilliant tour,5.0,,"Our guide was Jerome, who gave us a knowledgeable and comprehensive overview of the fall of the city in WW2. A thoroughly enjoyable tour, well worth $18 Singapore."
,,Excellent tour,5.0,,The tour guide was very informative and friendly. We learned a lot from this trip about the history of singapore and the events in WW2
,,Of Graves Guns and Battles tour.,4.0,,"We visited Fort Canning Park to go on the Battlebox tour.We went on the extended tour which was 2 1/2 hours long.The day we went there were only 5 of us, we toured Fort Cannig Park first of all, and were told the history of and importance of the hill, visiting graveyards,the various buildings ,we were even given a food tasting in a restaurant of a delicious famous Biryani, and introduced to some unusual spices .After the surface tour we went to the underground Bunker and learnt about the battle fought with the Japanese, shown short informative films and shown around.
I really enjoyed this tour ,I went as my husband was keen to go, and found I learnt a lot. The time passed quickly and our guide Shar( I believe) was great, very enthusiastic and knowledgeable.
The tour does involve a lot of steps and it is on a hill, but we did have a few rests along the way.The shorter Battlebox tour alone is available as well.Fort Canning Hill is also worth a visit, a quiet oasis."
,,Brilliant visit,5.0,,We visited the Battle Box on the recomendation of a relative. Our guide Kamaliah was very knowledgable and enthusiastic. It was good to see the maps detailing the advance through Malaysia and in to Singapore. This museum is a great addition to the tourist trail in Singapore.
,,History well done,5.0,,"A guided tour of the bunker underneath the old Fort Canning, from which the ill-fated Battle of Singapore was directed. As an amateur military historian I could not fault the guide (Hazeerah) who obviously knew her history. It was a little curious to hear a young Muslim woman consistently refer to the British Empire defenders as ""we"": ""we withdrew across the Causeway"", ""we were forced to surrender"" but it made it much more personal, as it was young people of her age - British, Australian, Indian, Malay and local Chinese volunteers - who did die and suffer.

There are a few stairs, but generally it is flat walking in a cool environment. I get the impression it is not on most tourists' itineraries, and whilst it is not a cultural show, it gives an essential insight into the history of Singapore. You certainly get an understanding of the curious relationship between Singapore and the British Empire, and of the Singapore that arose from the ashes of World War II. If you only have one day in Singapore, you must visit the Battlebox."
,,A Great Tour!!,5.0,,"This was a great way to spend the morning. The guide, Eisen, was enthusiastic and hugely knowledgeable. It was a highlight of our trip to this great City."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"This is an excellent way to learn about the surrender of Singapore in WW 2
Jerome was an excellent and informative guide around the underground bunker and explained the events of the time with passion and understanding. In the modern air conditioning it is difficult to grasp how bad the conditions would have been as it was overcrowded and everyone smoked. Also took us back after the tour to allow more time to read the boards"
,,Must See Location,5.0,,Despite being small the Battle Box is without doubt my #1 attraction in Singapore. Knowledgeable staff talk you through the fall of Singapore in WW2 and the role that the Battle Box had in proceedings. Your not allowed to take pictures but this is just a small gripe in what was a very enjoyable 90 minute look around the structure buried deep in Fort Canning Hill.
,,Different,5.0,,"Battlebox is in Fort Canning Park and takes around 7-8 mins to walk from Dorby Ghaut MRT station. There are no self walking available at the moment. The tours are led by guides. The cost is $18 for adults, $9 per kids (7-12). The tour takes around 1 - 1,5 hrs and the last one is at 4pm. There are 2,5 hrs tours available for $32 for adults including Graves, Guns and Battles. We were a very small group sharing some historic knowledge among ourselves (thanks Mal for being an awesome guide) It is my 1st time in Asia and was a great experience seeing the history from a very different perspective."
,,A Great Historical Monument,4.0,,A good overall coverage of the situation in Singapore at the time of the Second World war. There certainly seemed to be a lack of leadership from the hierarchy.
,,Very informative history!,5.0,,Mel gave us an excellent tour of this underground bunker. This along with the Changi prison museum are important sites in understanding the impact of WW2 on Singapore. Highly recommended (plus the bunkers are now fully air conditioned so it is a comfortable tour!)
,,WW II revisted,5.0,,A good two hour experience with guide in the ill fated defense by the British of Singapore from Japanese attack 1941. Walking distance from the Hotel Fort Cannery. A surrender to the Japanese marking the ultimate demise of thousands of troops taken prisoner.
,,A wonderful walk,5.0,,"We walked to Fort Canning and really enjoyed the scenery. There was quite a bit to see, I was surprised. Very interesting."
,,Make this one of your Top Ten things to do in Singapore,4.0,,This is a great way to learn about what happened to Singapore & Malaysia in the Second World War. The guide was first rate and told the story in an informative and interesting way. Visiting the bunker certainly brought the story to life.
,,Just fantastic - a must do in Singapore!,5.0,,"While I am a student of military history, anyone from 10 to 70 regardless of gender will enjoy this tour. The guide for our tour was Joanne and she was excellent, very knowledgeable and friendly, a great ambassador for Singapore and the Battlebox.

The tour is about 90 minutes, does involve some walking but is very comfortable (and air conditioned) and very informative. You will learn all about the history of Singapore during WW2 and the events that led to its fall. While none of the exhibits are 'original' they have done a great job recreating several rooms and creating short movies you will see along the way.

If your taxi driver is uncertain where to go, just say 'Hotel Fort Canning'.

And also take an hour to walk around the park itself.... it is really lovely and well worth a visit. If you go to the fort gate, look for the hidden entrance to the stairs to the roof. A great view from the top!"
,,Excellent tour,5.0,,The Battlebox is a great tour that will help you learn more about the war in the Pacific during WWII...Both educational and interesting! I highly recommend the Battlebox tour!
,,A major highlight in Singapore,4.0,,"This is an excellent attraction. It is in this underground bunker during World War 2 that the British had their centre of operations and eventually came to the decision to surrender. A highly informative guide, Anuradya, showed the group around. Her commentary was very engaging an she made everyone in the group appreciate the work that was done there, the conditions in which they had to work, and the dramatic story of the surrender. Included are some audiovisuals that help to explain the story. The bunker is air conditioned and is easy to walk around. My only reason for giving an overall score of 4 out of 5 is that the guided tour is compulsory and there is not enough time to fully read the many excellent information panels and appreciate all of the images. Our guide definitely deserves 5 out of 5 ! Two points to note: the signage in Fort Canning does not make it very easy to find the ticket office and entrance. Also, no photography is allowed inside, which is a little disappointing as it would give people the opportunity to photograph and then read the information later on."
,,Make this the top of your list,5.0,,The Battle Box tour is a must do if you visit Singapore. This is a fascinating and interesting aspect of Singapore's history. We booked our tour through the Fort Canning Hill kiosk and for a family of 5 cost us $72S - worth every cent. Nancy our tour guide took us on a journey into one of World War 2's most significant decisions in military history and we loved every minute of it for almost 2 hours. Fort Canning is a remarkable landmark in Singapore and the Battle Box is between the old Ford Canning Central Command HQ now the Hotel Fort Canning and the Art Centre - previously the Married Solider's Quarters during WWII. Absolutely the best tour you take in Singapore and in fact you can only visit the Battle Box by booking the tour. Many people rate the Changi Museum as No 1 but the Battle Box is the best.
,,Tour,5.0,,Was a very interesting tour and our guide was great. Jerome was very knowledgeable on the history of the battlebox and made the tour. A lot of the history of Singapore is covered in this tour without it been boring. Would recommend it to all that are interested in learning the history of Singapore and then follow with Changi jail tour.
,,Very interesting museum,5.0,,"Don't miss this attraction, the hour long tour was conducted really clearly by a knowledgeable Jerome. The exhibit itself has been well restored, I bought the accompanying book (optional) from the gift store and was glad I did."
,,Definitely worth visiting,5.0,,"Highly recommend this tour. You go down into bunkers under Fort Canning Park where you learn about the fall of Singapore in WWII. Our tour guide, Nancye, was very informative and knowledgeable. I recommend this for tourists and locals. I have done this tour a few times over the years and each time learn something new. There is a lot of information to take in which is the reason each time I have learnt something new. A must when in Singapore."
,,You should do this,4.0,,"At first I was reluctant to see this site as the brochures don't do it justice but I am so glad that I did go.

You cannot do this attraction without doing a tour so make sure you plan your visit around the tour schedule.

The tour guide Anu was very knowledgeable and made the tour entertaining and interesting. She was very polite and accomodating - even with those few who think it's ok to share their own knowledge (there is always one on a tour like this).

I would highly recommend this tour if you have the time. The tour is about an hour to an hour and half long depending on the size of the group and cost $18SGD."
,,Excellent Museum! One of the best!,5.0,,"We visited Battlebox on the recommendation of others at TA. We couldn't have been more pleased! An hour and a half guided tour that explained not only the facility but the context of the surrender of Singapore. Anu was our guide and was excellent. There isn't much to do in Singapore in terms of history, but this should be at the top of anyone's list."
,,Educational and intriguing tour,5.0,,It's a great tour for anybody who's keen to know more about the 2nd world war and the history of the country. You will get the experience in an actual war room. The guides are well trained in their knowledge and delivery. Thumbs up!
,,Excellent and insightful,5.0,,"Very good tour with our excellent guide ( Jerome ) who explained very clearly and impartially the uses of the spaces and the strategies of the Japanese and British commanders. Rather sobering to discover the negligent planning of the British which left the Malay peninsular so exposed, but that is the lesson of the 1920's and 30's.

The museum was a good balance of objects and explanation and the presentation by our guide was a very high standard. I would definately recommend, together with the National Museum of Singapore where you can learn about the Japanese occupation."
,,Battlebox visit,4.0,,An engaging and informative tour conducted by a knowledgeable tour guide. Recommended for those who are keen to learn more about Singapore's history in an authentic environment.
,,Battlebox - Brilliant and the Best!,5.0,,My husband and son had a great afternoon enjoying this informative and fascinating historical exhibition. A must see for understanding about this part of Singapore's history. Excellent guided tour by Kelysha.
,,Very interesting!,5.0,,"I went to the Battlebox back in 2008 on my first visit to Singapore. When it came around to returning to Singapore, the Battlebox was a must! My fiancé and I did the Battlebox tour this time around soon after the renovations were complete and it was an absolutely fantastic experience. The staff at the Battlebox were brilliant and very good at retelling the story of Singapore. If you visit Singapore, the Battlebox is a must!"
,,Great museum,5.0,,"Having got to the Battlebox using a taxi (due to a combination of a humid day and an unwanted steep hill walk) we were told that the only way we could look around was by guided tour one hour later. The wait was well worth it.

We were taken around by Mel, who obviously has a real passion for her job. The tour starts by giving a brief history of Singapore but 90% of it goes into the details of the weeks leading up to the Battle of Singapore.

It lasts one hour and is suited for all ages including both my Mum (who is in her mid-seventies) and children around 10 who were also on the tour.

If you're a real history buff then I suspect you may want more time to explore the bunker without the tour or require further reading but for our purposes it was perfect."
,,Fantastic introduction to the fall of Singapore,5.0,,Generally I am not a big fan of military history but a friend recommended Battlebox and I was not disappointed. One can only enter Battlebox by guided tour (SND $18) which is held several times a day. The tour was really well done and provided a balanced/factual account of the fall of Singapore in 1942.
,,Great father and son experience,5.0,,"Did the one hour tour, it was very interesting, we both enjoyed it very much and the guide was very knowledgeable. I would thoroughly recommend this."
,,Very worthwhile,5.0,,My young guide Jerome was knowledgeable and brought the history and use of the battlebox to life. The 1 1/4 hour tour was worth every cent!
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,Great place to understand some of the history of Singapore with staff who have a great knowledge to share.
,,Unexpected gem in Singapore,5.0,,Amazing insite into a significant historical event. Guides very informative and display very realistic. A must see when visiting.
,,Did not bore me for 1 sec,5.0,,"Interactive, good, interesting, not too long but detailed enough. Excellent guide. A must do, even for those who are not so WWII minder."
,,A must,5.0,,Visited with my wife whom is not a huge history or war buff but we were mesmerized from start to finish. The museum has had a recent refurbishment with the addition of interesting story boards and fantastic life size models of the men and main figures involved in the campaign. Our guide was so knowledgeable. She was clearly so passionate about the history of that time and it showed. An absolute must do.
,,Battle box - Excellent tour,4.0,,"We did the 1 hour tour this morning with our two children 12 and 9. The tour guide - Jerome - was superb. He was very knowledgable, clear and engaging. The battle box itself is interesting in its purpose and role within the surrender of Singapore but Jerome really bought it to life for all visiting."
,,Joanne you're a superstar :),5.0,,"Amazing experience. Very few wars museums mesmerize you and this is up there with the very best. The guided tour was very thorough and although the exhibitions are limited, you do get the ghastly feeling that you’ve paid for! Joanne is an absolute top notch guide and I’ll remember this experience for a very long time."
,,Battlebox tour,5.0,,"We - my husband and I - went on a Battlebox Tour - it was really good. The tour of the museum was great - no photos allowed though, which was a bit disappointing, as it was set out really well - would've like some photo's as souvenirs. The drive up to the cemetery was very good - our guide Wei Wei, was very informative and witty. The cemetery was beautifully maintained and very easy to move around."
,,Must Visit Battlebox,5.0,,"Our tour guide was exceptional, fantastic knowledge and easy to understand him. Although you have to get up to the top to get your tickets, it is well worth the little hike to the top, fantastic setup with the wax displays as it really takes you back to when it all happened."
,,A hidden gem,4.0,,I was looking for something to do which would both be interesting but out of the Singapore heat. This tour hit the spot as I'm interested in history & the tour was not too long (75 mins). Our tour group was small - only 7 people & our guide was very informative.
,,Insight into History,5.0,,Set in Canning Park a visit to see the history of British Army occupation and the surrender in the second world war is well worth it. It's carried out by local guides who give a good in depth history and there are also videos of actuals film footage of the fall of Singapore. You meet at the visitors centre and you are then guided through the Battlebox.
,,Experiencing the Battle Box,5.0,,We went to the Battle Box on recommendation of a British couple that we had visited with during a Christmas party. We were in Singapore visiting our son and his family who have been in Singapore for almost 4 years. Our new friends had just visited the Battle Box and were enthusiastic in their recommendation. My husband and I joined other visitors for the guided tour that was led by a very knowledgeable and amiable guide. We were amazed with the authenticity of the vignettes portrayed and the wealth of historical material available for perusal. It was an eye opening experience for us about the realities of war during that time. Well preserved and well presented.
,,A brief revisit into Singapore history,5.0,,"Even though I'm a local, I learnt many things which were not taught in history lessons or textbooks. The guide (Kamaliah) was knowledgeable and friendly. Felt that a bit more time could be allocated to allow us to glance through the information boards in the rooms - couldn't pay attention to the guide and read at the same time and we were ushered quite quickly from room to room. Good to hear that they intend to have self-guided tours in future. Highly recommended for tourists and locals alike."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"We stumbled upon this rather unmarketed attraction by accident when exploring Sentosa Island (a common theme). Part of the wider Fort complex, this exhibit was excellent, educational, cheap to explore and even a brief aircon respite from the very strong sun! The waxworks aren't bad, and the accompanying information made this a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Highly recommended!"
,,Fun and educational,5.0,,"It was a very interesting and informative tour, even for a local. The history docent was very friendly and knowledge. She made the tour very enjoyable. The bunker was surprisingly well restored. I had foolishly expected to see ruins!"
,,Excellent & Knowledgable Guide,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our tour at the battle box, our guide was enthusiastic and had so much knowledge that our tour was extended slightly - which was good for us because why would you want to turn away from extra information especially when you're there to learn more about history.

When the tour ended we asked the staff who our guide was (because we missed the introduction as we went in a little late) and they told us he's the director of battlebox, Jeya was his name. He could answer every question thrown at him by the visitors which was amazing. Such a pleasant surprise! As a local, I would recommend visiting the site and exploring the area as you can learn quite a bit about the history of Singapore. Definitely worth it!"
,,Hidden History of Singapore,5.0,,"What an incredible journey through a very important time in history.

We were hesitant about the only option of a guided tour but once inside the bunker you can understand why it's a guided tour. It's a well put together walk through tour of the fall of Singapore and the events that culminated in the fall to the Japanese forces.

And it gives you a rest bite from ether the heat or rain!"
,,Very Good - If You Love Military History,5.0,,"I went here with my two teenage daughters and my wife. The tour itself is very enlightening about World War 2 and the broader picture of the Pacific Campaign, before discussing a lot of detail about the fall of Singapore itself. The tour of the 'BattleBox itself was heavily focused on day to day life in the Headquarters and also the history so you get a good learning opportunity. The guides are extremely knowledgeable and the displays itself are very well done. Only bad point is that you cant just rock up; as the centre only opens when a tour commences so check this out in advance."
,,Interesting site,5.0,,Excellent and enthusiastic tour guide who was happy to answer questions. Very informative with videos and models. An interesting place to visit.
,,A Must for History Buffs!,5.0,,I am very interested in World war Two history and have visited many museums across the world. This is one the finest attractions I have seen. Very good comprehensive 1.5 hour tour that was quick paced and informative. The command bunker is very well preserved and the wax figures add a special dimension of realism. You feel like you are walking in to the actual events.
,,Great Tour and very clear and knowledgeable guide!,5.0,,It was a very engaging tour and the guide was very clear and knowledgeable. Definitely recommended for tourists as well as locals!
,,a sad part of Singapore history,5.0,,"My narrator was outstanding, she explaining the narrative on how Singapore had to surrendered. to a vicious occupier . To all those young and innocent young men of the British Empire.and too the poor civilians of Singapore, who had to suffer four years of occupation ."
,,Battle box Singapore,5.0,,Really good tour. Well informed and friendly guide. Lots of interesting information and videos. Certainly worth a visit.
,,Highlight of Singapore,5.0,,"This was an excellent place to visit in Singapore. As mentioned, the guided tour with Sharul was very good indeed and his own personal stories of the war really brought home the story of Singapore's surrender to the Japanese.
I'm not usually a fan of waxworks but figures of the men in charge interspersed around the museum added to the history and feel of the place.
This should definitely be a MUST VISIT on your Singapore list :)"
,,Very informative,5.0,,We did the paid tour and it is worth every penny. The tour is typically an hour but goes over if the questions and the discussions are engaging.
,,New understanding of WII & Singapore,4.0,,"Glad we selected the early 9:45 tour, and so were a small group of 6. Excellent timeline information on the fall of Singapore and the difficulties of field communications. Good video & pictorial information, and recreated working environments."
,,Fascinating snapshot into the fall of Singapore,5.0,,"This tour is well worth doing, as it takes you underground into the WW2 bunker used during the surrender to Japan. It brings to life the final days of the British rule and the heartbreaking decision that had to be made."
,,Fantastic find,5.0,,What a terrific find this is! Lots of steps to get up here and got a bit lost through the Fort Canning Hotel en route. Guided tours only available and only at specific times and cost me $18 SGD. There were 7 people in our group. Meandering through the 29 underground rooms of the bunker with our excellent guide Kel took just over and hour. It is a mix of dioramas and exhibits and a couple of times you get to sit down and watch a short video. I learnt an awful lot about this dark period of Singapore history and the British surrender to the Japanese. It's lovely and cool down here and a complete antithesis to Orchard Road just a stone's throw away. Highly recommended.
,,Battlebox,4.0,,This I enjoyed our tour guide during this tour of the tunnel was very good knew what the history was the recreation of the scenes was good and I found it interesting to learn more of the history of Fort Canning
,,Brilliant fall of Singapore recreation,5.0,,"Who would have thought there was a 29 room bunker under the Fort Canning Hill! Not only does it exit, but you can step back in time to gain an understanding of how the Japanese completely overrun the Malay Peninsula and Singapore in about 50 days during WW2.

I'm not a war buff, but I found the presentation incredibly interesting, the exhibits and video pertinent and moving and the sense of being 3 floors underground quite astounding. Our guide, Shul, was knowledgeable and his love of history shone through - this is rare in tourist attractions and is to be commended.

The tour ends with footage of the British, Australian and Indian troops surrendering to the Japanese at Changi - very moving.

The tour is air conditioned and is a wonderful way to stay cool and learn something new. Please visit. You won't regret it."
,,a travel to the military underground Bunker,5.0,,"This is a british era underground bunker situated on top of fort canning hill and has 22 rooms mess, communication rooms quarters for staff.

it was built o stay safe during war and well maintained by management. it costs 8$ to look around the bunker. The timings are very limited and very good attraction not to be missed for a history buffs and also appreciate their engineering skills."
,,Top tour,5.0,,"An absolutely thorough,informative and at times very poignant guided tour of the BattleBox. I was particularly impressed with Mel's knowledge and it was great to have a chat post tour. I was also very impressed with the staffs general attitude towards Singapore history - it needs to be kept alive with good work such as this. It is exciting to hear about the future plans for the BattleBox -such a shame we can't be there for the 75th anniversary. Once again tremendous experoence"
,,Hidden Gem,5.0,,very interesting and informative tour - a must do if you are in the area - also on site a coffee shop that does fabulous authentic clam chowder .
,,Fascinating tour great tour guide,5.0,,A fascinating hour tour at fort canning battle box. Guides are charming and knowledgable about a fascinating subject and very indulgent of my knowledge of that time in history which mainly comes from books and films. It would have been even better if you could combine it with a visit to the old ford factory Japanese headquarters in Singapore and the changi Museum re the occupation. Tip - check the time of the ours as entry isn't allowed unless part of the official tour.
,,Battlebox tour,5.0,,We were at for canning hill for the december holiday. My kids were 15 and 8 years old. We were enjoying the rich heritage that we had in fort canning hill and part of the heritage was how the battlebox was used in the second world war. The tour led us through the battlebox with descirptions of what the rooms were used for and the situation at that point in time. The guide was approachable and told the story with clarity. My older boy was able to appreciate and relate to what he had learnt in school while my younger ones enjoyed the storytelling.
,,Into the Bunker,4.0,,"Quite similar to the Malinta Tunnel audio-visual tour on Corregidor Island in Manila. Shorter of course as the actual amount of WWII comabat was more brief in SG than it was in PH. Dioramas seem accurate and have a subtle life of their own without being too creepy, in my opinion. And the tour guide/s are knowledgable, well rehearsed, and project their voice/s well. The inclusion of military artifacts is a great feature."
,,important history,5.0,,important history on the fall of Singapore is available at this location. The commentary was factual and detailed the events leading up to the British surrender. The site is well preserved in its original configuration.
,,Battlebox visit,5.0,,I was very impressed both with the models and display. It was very informative of an era which affected Australia greatly. The guide was both pleasant and very well versed in the History. I'm glad Singapore is retaining this historical place.
,,"Excellent, informative and thought provoking",5.0,,The guided tour as approx. 75 minutes and provided an interesting insight into the surrender of the Allied forces to Japan in WW2. The guide could answer any additional questions and ha an excellent knowledge of the history of the time. We also visited Changi museum and this tour was a good fit as it covered up to the surrender but not much further to ensure each museum has a specific focus. Highly recommended.
,,Def worth a visit.,5.0,,"Very knowledgeable guide who made our visit extremely interesting and informative. Tour is in small groups as rooms are quite small. It was very good value for money too. Having visited the Changi museum earlier in week, we found that this tour answered many questions we had.
We made our way there by MRT and taxi ( as we were a little unsure where is was....and it was raining!)"
,,A walk through SG's history via the hole called the battlebox,5.0,,"I've been visiting museums all over SG. And each of it gives me a lesson in SG's history, culture, and ethnicity. It's just by chance that I happened to pass by the battlebox. It's one of a kind in the sense that we're given actual glimpse of what it was like to protect the honor and peace of SG. It's like a climax of my SG study because all of those I learned and know from my other museum, gallery, and park visits seems like a preparation to my battlebox tour. I now fully understand how things connects, why SG is multiculture and why it is so open to foreigners. The tour made me cry, made me proud, and made me realize that I am not actually an outsider to this foreign country. That somehow I have connection, in terms of history and struggle to this small yet progressive land."
,,Battlebox Singapore,4.0,,The trip was informative for my children especially on the history of Japanese occupation of Malaya.Some room for improvement :accuracy of facts mentioned in tour...WW2 started in earlier in Kota Baru by a few minutes than Pearl Habour...Battlebox was said to be undetectable by satellite!There was no satellite in 1941...otherwise it was a great experience!
,,Informative,5.0,,"We took our kids aged 7 and 9 to the Battle Box and we all found it very interesting. Entry is only with group tours which is mostly a positive thing as you have the guide to ask questions of. On the other hand, we didn't spend quite as much time in some rooms as I would have liked. The tour moved at a good pace for the children though and the guide was very good with the kids. I'm glad that we weren't able to bring them a few years ago due to the renovations, as kids younger than 7 probably wouldn't get so much out of it."
,,A Fantastic Opportunity,5.0,,"Last time I visited Singapore this attraction was not listed on Trip Advisor, which is always what I use to find interesting things to do in new cities. I find it almost annoying that I didn't know about this the first time I went to Singapore. This is an absolutely must see attraction for any war history buff visiting Singapore. The tour guide was very well informed and well spoken. I encourage you to check it out."
,,Good value,5.0,,"Learned so much on this visit. The groups are not too large as some of the rooms you visit on the tour are quite small. The young man who took our group around had a most detailed knowledge. He was really enthusiastic, interesting and informative. We could not fault him. The tour was really good value for money and we were so glad we made the effort to go after a hard week of sightseeing."
,,A history lesson,5.0,,Being of a certain age (war babies) we found the visit most interesting and educational. Our Tour Guide was excellent and informative. We are glad we visited
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"Jerome was an outstanding tour guide of an outstandingly curated museum. An interesting perspective of how the island was so poorly equipped for defense and the army was abandoned by the air force and the navy when they lost their effectively outdated equipment. The whole story being one of lack of political will to make sure there was an adequate, modern defense capability - a lesson from WWII we should not overlook."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"This visit encompassed a tour through the underground command centre which was set up in the 1930s. The guide described the story of the fall of Singapore in 1942 as we moved through the various rooms. The tour was extremely well constructed and well-told, to the point where it gave me goose bumps!
People can only visit this place as part with a guided group which leave at certain times during the day (depending on the day of the week). It took about 2 hours in total and is easy walking.
I found it just fascinating and am very glad I took the time to visit. In fact it was the highlight of my time in Singapore. I thoroughly recommend this place."
,,Highly recommend,5.0,,Very informative tour by Jerome everyone thoroughly enjoyed it and learnt a great deal. Can't believe it was only found again in 1988!
,,Amazing tour of a forgotten part of Singapore.,5.0,,"The visit to the underground command centre used in wwll was simply amazing and is highly recommended to history buffs and travellers. The visit to the forgotten underground hq is remarkably comfortable as the underground rooms are well lit, with minimal steps and is air conditioned. The tour is well constructed and is enhanced with period furnishings and displays. The tour guide Jerome was highly knowledgeable. I spent about 80 minutes from start to finish of the tour and found it riveting."
,,Would recommend for both casuals and history buffs!,4.0,,"Learned new things about WWII and busted a few myths. Apart from exploring the bunker itself (which is interesting on its own to tell the story/stresses of the men who once occupied it), the docent made use of lecture, videos and military sandtables to answer questions such as - whether General Yamashita had been really playing a ""bluff""?; Would the British have prevailed if they had just stood their ground longer? etc. all to ultimately ask - Was the fall of Singapore inevitable? Truly engaging!

Extra points: The entire tour is wheelchair-accessible!"
,,Extremely Well Organised Tour,5.0,,"I'm not really a person who is generally interested in World War II history, however as I've visited Singapore many times, I felt that I should go on this tour in order to understand more about this very important chapter in Singapore's past.

After catching the train to Dhoby Gaut MRT Station, getting lost several times, and then walking up several long flights of stairs, I finally arrived at the Battlebox Visitors' Centre.

I was warmly welcomed by the attendants at the desk and bought my S$18 ticket for the next tour which was due to begin in about 15 minutes.

From memory, I think there were about 10 people on our tour and our guide was the very entertaining and knowledgeable Eisen.

It was an amazing tour and I found Eisen's enthusiasm was contagious. He was able to answer all the questions that were fired at him and when we returned to the Visitor's Centre was able to recommend a book to me so that I could learn more.

Due to Eisen, and this Tour, I went from being someone who was mildly interested, to someone who had a thirst to learn more about the fall of Singapore."
,,Battle and surrender of Singapore,5.0,,"Excellent story told using pictures, sets with mannequin, maps and videos of the events leading up to and during the battle of Singapore"
,,While visiting Fort Canning,5.0,,Recently reopened to the public after renovation. Guided tours only. A very good little known history review of the capitulation of allied forces inSingapore
,,Fall of Singapore,5.0,,I visited the Battlebox in 2004 and this was a return visit with friends who are very interested in WW2 history. It was the highlight of their visit this time to Singapore. They had previously visited Changi Prison. The guide gave us a very informative and balanced tour. My only negative was my husband could not go on the tour as he is in a wheelchair. Not sure if they have wheelchairs available to use. He prefers his own chair. The Battlebox is well worth a visit!
,,Cool tour and an interesting piece of history to visit,4.0,,"Really cool tour, our guide was super well versed in the history and background of the battle box. Lots of good information here if you are a history buff. Wish they would let you take pictures though."
,,Very informative and well presented tour,4.0,,"Very worthwhile tour for anyone interested in WW2 Singapore, the guide was knowledgeable and engaging. Recommended"
,,Wonderful surprise!,5.0,,"This one hour tour provided new understanding about how war was waged and decisions made by commanders in WWII Singapore. Our guide was a college age woman who was informed and interesting as she led us room to room in this WWII underground bunker. The life sized reproductions of the military men and their surroundings and short videos helped to portray the conditions and reasoning behind military decisions. Really worth a visit, even if you are not a WWII history buff."
,,Colonial/WW2 History in Singapore,4.0,,"I was lucky to arrive in time for a tour, as Battle Box has been closed the last few times I have been in Singapore. Really enjoyed the information and the greater insight into that period of history. I would have liked another 10 minutes at the end to read all the info in the first (and last) room we visited....otherwise, all good and well worth going.."
,,"Interesting tour, if a little canned",4.0,,"I enjoyed the tour, even though I am not a great history buff. It was nicely aimed at an intelligent interested audience, no cheap thrills, but a serious evaluation of the British surrender of Singapore to Japan in Feb 1942.

Missing was a bit more time to look around in the bunker, and read all the posters/displays."
,,A glimpse of a dark day In WW2,5.0,,"Excellent guide - clear, concise and really knew her stuff. Battle box itself was well lit with great depictions of the characters involved in the decision making process of the surrender of Singapore. Great value for money"
,,Impressive,5.0,,Battlebox brings impressive details on a dramatic and historic event back in 1942. A must if you want to know some more on the local history in the last century. Very well presented and an informative guide.
,,Very informative,5.0,,Jerome was an excellent guide The tour was well presented and the photos and maps well chosen and informatively the
,,Informative tour of an interesting historical site,5.0,,"Our tour of the Battlebox was a highlight of our time in Singapore. The exhibits are varied and interesting, and our tour guide Jerome was clearly a history buff (takes one to know one!), And was able to answer all our questions in detail. He even provided me with information concerning my own family history, and recommended a visit to Changi Prison museum which was also very worthwhile."
,,Brilliant - be aware hard to find & get there!!,4.0,,"Firstly and foremost if you have a problem with very steep inclines, lots of steps - do yourself a favour and get a taxi!! Getting to the Battlebox is no walk in the park.
Once there you will be amazed at the work/organisation that has been put into this collection of memorabilia and historical facts. Worth the visit."
,,Battlebox history tour,5.0,,The guided tour of the Battlebox was excellent with the guide providing an exceptionally knowledgeable history of the Fall of Singapore in WWII. Spurred me into visiting other historical sites like Changi.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"The Battlebox was an amazing thing to do, so interesting considering id also been to Pearl Harbour. I learnt so much and the guide Kel was amazing. Plus I won a copy of the surrender document at the end by answering a question from the tour before the others. Brilliant!"
,,Outstanding exhibition that is well worth a visit....,5.0,,"It is very easy to get to Fort Canning. When you arrive at Fort Canning head towards the Visitors' Centre. When you're facing The Centre turn towards your left hand side and keep walking! It is not so easy to find Battlebox and for whatever reason they are not allowed to improve the signposts for it.

It's well worth the visit when you eventually get there though. The exhibit is well thought out and is facilitated by a guide. It's so helpful to have the guide rather than just have headphones - it all adds to the atmosphere.

It will take you about 2 hours to get around the exhibit. It's quite a small space so perhaps not for the claustrophobic, though I was OK and it I suffer from it so.....

Once you've visited Battlebox make sure you have a nice walkaround Fort Canning and visit the old barracks and park. You can have a nice, cool drink at Fort Canning Hotel. It's an enjoyable half day trip and it makes you really appreciate the history behind the fall of Singapore."
,,Well worth the wait,4.0,,An excellent insight into the fall of Singapore. The Battlebox has only just reopened so the guides don't have many of the personal stories which bring these things to life but still an excellent hour.
,,Excellent upgrade,5.0,,"My wife and I have been to the battle box a couple of times in the past, before the upgrade. The new presentation is excellent and we were very fortunate to book the 0945 tour as we were the only visitors involved. A delightful and very knowledgeable young lady called Joanne gave us a personal tour lasting 90 minutes. She was able to add to our knowledge, stir our emotions, make us question preconceived notions and we left well satisfied with the experience. This 'attraction' is an excellent prequel to a visit to the Ford factory and then to Changi. I'm 74 years old and need a stick to get around but I managed it well. Tip get a taxi there and back. Cost reasonable."
,,This was one of the highlights of our 3 day visit,5.0,,"You must plan your visit to each of the tour times, We met some visitors who were dissappointed to miss out and have to wait a few hours for the next tour. We had difficulty finding the site as signposting on Canning Hill is confusing when on foot. Our tour was first of the day and we had a personal guide just for the two of us. She was was excellent and knowledgeable providing the complete story."
,,A must see tour,5.0,,"If you don't know the real history of Singapore during WWII, this is the place to start. They have done a great job in preserving and restoring this facility. Don't miss it - it well worth it and the tour was great."
,,Battle Box Singapore,5.0,,"We have just visited the recently reopened Battle Box at Fort Canning, and would definitely recommend the experience for anyone interested in the history of Singapore, and particularly in the Fall of Singapore during the 2nd World War

Our guide, Jerome, was excellent and it was fascinating to be shown the areas of the bunker where crucial decisions were made

The tour lasts up to an hour and a half and tickets can be bought in advance"
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"A visit to the Battlebox is highly recommended to those of you with an interest in colonial and WW2 history. The tour was led by a young, knowledgeable and very enthusiastic young guide (Eisen - he'll explain the origin of his name!!) who brought the experience almost to life. This tour is great value for money and a must if you are visiting Singapore."
,,Highly recommended.,5.0,,Well presented history lesson. Our guide was very animated and made the whole tour extremely interesting. There was a lot I didn't know about Singapore's involvement in World War 11.
,,Battlebox Tour,5.0,,"Have been to Singapore before and read about this tour only recently. We found it very interesting, informative and gave insight into a part of Singapore's history that we were unaware of, particularly from a different perspective. Highly recommend this tour even if you are not history buffs but feel like something a little different to do. Our guide was also excellent and capable of answering all our questions."
,,"Well presented, great tour guide",5.0,,"An interesting little museum at what is left of the British underground command of WWII. Very well presented with original pieces and artefacts. A great overall history of the war in Singapore and what led to its surrender. Well decorated with models and artefacts room by room. Special mention to the tour guide (Nancy) who answered questions well and gave a solid walk around tour.

Tour takes around 90 minutes and is a great way to escape the afternoon humidity"
,,Very informative,4.0,,Only accessible via the group tour but very informative & interesting. Well worth a visit & the National Museum is next door so we visited both in one day.
,,Tour,5.0,,Excellent tour of Battlebox. Tour guide was fantastic and very informative. Really good value for money and I will do it again when I visit Singapore again.
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,An amazing tour ..especially for those interested in The History of Singapore..The guide was very knowledgeable ..and the tour was well worth the money ..just make sure that you arrive in time for a tour as you cannot enter the bunker without the tour.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"If you are interested in history, do yourself a favour and visit the Battlebox. The young guide was very knowledgable and very pleasant, all questions were well answered. The tour lasted 90 mins and we thought was a bargain at $18"
,,Tough decision,5.0,,Could be best to visit before going to Changi Museum to understand why Singapore surrendered. Jerome was a brilliant guide and encouraged questions. Remember it is underground.
,,Fascinating tour,5.0,,"This was an hour or two well spent with our 10 and 12 year old. The guide, Shar, was fantastic and his knowledge of WWII history is impressive. Very informative and a real experience to be in the battle box and the room where the important decision was made for the British army to surrender."
,,An insightful educational tour,5.0,,"Brought my kids (6, 8) and nephew/niece (12, 14). Highly educational, immersive experience with first person perspective of what took place in each room of the bunker. Very well presented by tour guide Jerome, who presented the facts from his memory. Exact dates, names, etc."
,,Battlebox,5.0,,Really enjoyed the 1 hour guided tour given by a very enthusiastic tour guide. Good overview of what happened in Singapore during WW2.
,,Learnable,5.0,,"The guided tour was very informative and especially for the ones who are interested in WW2. Combine with the exhibition in National Museum of Singapore, you will receive a better understanding of the whole picture."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"If you're interested in World War II history, this is the must-see place. Our guide, Sha, is very knowledgeble, passionate and friendly. We were impressed with every moment of our visiting. The atmosphere, the preserved military crafts and architectural really gives you chills. We spent 18 SGD each and it was totally worth it! Hope to be back on FEB 2017 to commemorate the 75th Fall of Singapore."
,,Very good guided tour into the history of the British surrender in WW2,5.0,,Excellent guided tour provided by a very knowledgable guide (Anu). I learned more about the context of the surrender and why the British forces had no real alternative decision. It was fantastic to see the place where such a monuments decision in British military history took place.
,,Battlebox - The Fall of Singapore,5.0,,I visited the Battlebox with a friend on our way to Australia. We loved the experience and found it most absorbing. the lifelike figures of the important army officers making the decision to capitulate were amazing and you have a real sense of the enormity of the decision. there were clips of film too which added to the atmosphere. the Hotel across was worth a visit too. lovely old colonial building.
,,Excellent visit,5.0,,"Had excellent tour here. Very informative ,very interesting . Defo worth a visit.found out so much I never knew."
,,The Battle of Singapore,5.0,,"The Battle Box Museum tour is of critical importance for any student of the Battle of Malaya and the fall of Singapore. In association with London's Imperial war Museum and various veterans groups, the museum takes you into an extremely accurate
recreation of the British command post and lets you see the lives of the combatants.
Be advised that you must go with a guided tour. There is no solo touring of the facility."
,,Excellent Guide,5.0,,"Eisen Teo gave us an enthusiastic and detailed account of the events leading to the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese in WW11. His knowledge of the subject was incredible and he spoke with really passion for the subject which brought the whole museum to life. The rooms, equipment and models are very well laid out and well looked after. An incredible place well preserved. Eisen and the team of historians work very hard. A must see attraction."
,,Interesting insight into Singapore history,5.0,,Tour given by extremely knowledgable guide from Historical Society. Excellent insight into Singapore's position in WW2 and what lead up to the surrender.
,,All new Battlebox,4.0,,"A very knowledgeable guide took us through the various chambers with a well structured discussion on how the war evolved and the part that the Battlebox played in the final days. The start and end of the tour has a great shop with books and other materials relating to the war that are not easily found elsewhere in Singapore. My teenage daughters said they weren't interested at the outset, but at the end agreed that they had had a good time"
,,Fall of Singapore,5.0,,"We wanted to learn more about the fall of Singapore and the role of the British and Australian armies in the Far East at that time. The Guide was very informative and the Photographs and footage , together with the actual tour of the Battle Box itself ,were especially interesting. We had a personal interest as an elderly friend was captured in Singapore and had the terrible misfortune to work on the railway line under the Japanese, the after effects of which he bore for the rest of his life."
,,This is a pretty good tour,5.0,,"I have to say that I was impressed, I was not expecting something this good. Definitely do this tour, it is informative, well thought out and a stark reminder that sometimes the most difficult decisions are the correct ones in the long term"
,,Great historical tour,4.0,,The tour was great. We were led by a guide who really knew his stuff and had studied the site extensively. The tour allowed no photos in the battle box but that would only take away from the trip. The battle box itself is fully air conditioned and was a welcome surprise when in the heat of a Singapore day.
,,"Poignant, informative and emotional tour",5.0,,"Tip: Book an early tour to get a more personalised and intimate tour. We booked a tour at 9:30am, which left just our tour guide Jerome and the two of us.

My partner and I decided to take a tour of the historical Singapore Battlebox during our stay in the city November 2016. Whilst we were aware of the major points of Singapore history whilst under British Governance the Battlebox tour focuses on the fall of the city during World War 2.

With this in mind, I'd break my review up into two distinct parts; the Battlebox fortification itself and the company behind the tour Singapore History Consultants.

Firstly on the fort itself, this tour doesn't take you to a building that's survived the test of time expecting it to tell you a story on its own. The Battlebox doesn't do this as it has been preserved and repaired to such a state that modern day visitors can freely visit. To enchance this, each room with historical significance has been fleshed out with mannequins and furniture so that it's relevance will be understood when encountered. Small details like British and Japanese graffiti have been preserved too.

Moving onto the Tour Operators, I can only offer the highest praise to both the shop staff and the tour guide provided by Singapore History Consultants. The shop staff were welcoming and full of suggestions on things to do during our stay. Jerome our guide for the morning was a perfect dichotomy of manners, knowledge and charm. His sphere of knowledge wasn't just limited to the Singapore campaign but expanded to the entire Japanese theatre of war across the Pacific region. For those that might be doing their family research or know military participation in this part of the world, you'll gain a little bit more value.

Overall, the tour and all its various features are a great way to pass some time and learn more about the city if Singapore."
,,Interesting and informative,5.0,,If you are into your history particularly world war 2 this is the place for you. Very informative and quite fun to walk around in the steps of the old soldiers. Currently guided tours only for $18 per adult and $9 for children (although I'd say it's aimed at adults) they are planning on opening it without tours by February I believe she said but the guides are very knowledgeable and friendly. Be prepared to learn a lot! Currently they do not allow photos inside the battle box though so do not be expecting to take any!
,,Top-class tour about Singapore surrendering in WW2,5.0,,"I'm not really one for military history and wasn't completely sure I would like this, but it was brilliant!

We went on the 4pm tour with Sha, who was a great tour guide with a genuine passion for his subject. He walked us seamlessly through Singapore's early history to it's role in WW2. We were given a really insightful and interesting overview of the key characters involved in the bette between Singapore/Britain and Japan and the decisions that both sides made that led to Singapore's eventual surrender in 1942.

We learned so much from the tour and really enjoyed the topic. We definitely hadn't learned about this at school and it was interesting to get a new and different perspective on WW2."
,,Battle Box Fort Canning tour,5.0,,"Excellent, the guide Anu was simply brilliant. She guided us through the entire history of the Singapore war, allied involvement.. Anu was professional, extremely knowledgable and spoke with passion and authority on the subject. She was entertaining and the entire tour was absolutely fantastic. Highly recommended. By far the best thing we have done during our visit to Singapore.."
,,A very interetsing story on the Fall of Singapore,4.0,,The Battle box is located 10m underground in Fort Canning Park and was the command post during the invasion of Singapore by the Japanese. Opens your eyes to the complete stuff up by the British on the fall of Singapore during the WW2.
,,Insightful Tour,5.0,,"Fort Canning is a lovely park. Wear comfortable walking shoes. Buy your ticket for the tour at the visitor's center (S$18/adult (no senior discount)). I took the 11 am tour and it was a nice, small group. Jerome, our guide, is knowledgeable and has a great passion for Singaporean history. The tour lasted a little over an hour and I would recommend it.
After the tour, consider having lunch or dessert at The Fabulous Baker Boy."
,,Excellent - not to be missed,4.0,,"Having just read a book on the fall of Singapore this was an excellent place to visit, Fort Canning and it's landscape are also worth a visit.mthe Battlebox guide was very good and the whole tour was very atmospheric."
,,Recent visit,5.0,,"Ramallah was fantastic as a guide for the fascinating story of how Singapore 'fell' on 15.02.1942. I met an Aussie (Howard) who's Dad, like mine, worked on the notorious Burma-Thai railway during WW2. My wife, Chris, said that it explained very well all the events which led up to the Allies capitulation in what is now regarded as 'not' Churchill's finest hour. A lot of story & emotions crammed into a seemingly 'missable' visit. FULL MARKS!"
,,well worth a visit,5.0,,"We took the 9.45am tour and found it fascinating. The Guide Eisen was very passionate about the history of the site and about the history of Singapore. We learned a great deal and would recommend it to anyone who has the time, the tour takes about 90 minutes. After the tour we looked around the Fort Canning Park and it was beautiful."
,,Great site to visit for those interested in history,5.0,,"Very good attraction to visit, especially after having done the National museum, it comes with extra details and insights into the particular period of WWII in Singapore and Malaya. And it is also very concrete, the visit taking place in the underground facilities of Fort Canning, rather well conserved.

Our guide Eisen was great, very knowledgable and enthusiastic.

Recommended!"
,,"Adventure, for WWII enthusiast",5.0,,"I found the Battlebox by chance on the Internet, so I think that I should give it a chance.Long story short, you are going to hear about how and why the Battlebox was constructed by the British before the Japanese Malaya campaign begin and it's function during the War, then come underground and see what did those under Lt Gen. Percival endure before surrender, not just that, you're also see the function of each room in the Battlebox, and the final moment when Percival held a meeting to discuss whether an counterattack should be conduct or just raise the white flag. And the rest, is history. Personally, the folks there are really friendly and helpful, and for those who like history, especially WWII part, you should give the place a shot."
,,Very interesting and informative,5.0,,"Joined the 11am tour which turned out to be only 5 people. This newly opened bunker, where the decision was taken to surrender Singapore to the Japanese, is an important landmark of recent history. It is in the process of being improved for visitor accessibility. Lots to see and take in for anyone interested in WWII history. Eisen Teo was an extremely knowledgable guide who brought the story to life on many levels."
,,Fascinating insight to WW2,5.0,,"We were a bit uncertain whether to do this. However, the delightful and helpful staff in the shop convinced us. Eisen the guide was excellent and gave us a brilliant insight to the wartime history of Singapore. Well worth the trip and good value for money which anyhow goes to the upkeep of the place"
,,dont miss,5.0,,"Fantastic tour guide Jerome, Not to be missed if you love history. Very informative and a lot of work has been done to the display since I last visited 18 years ago. A must for your Singapore trip, not just shopping there is so much to see and visit in Singapore."
,,Hidden History,4.0,,The Battlebox is the underground bunker from which the Allied commanders organised the ill fated defence of Singapore during the Japanese invasion in WW2. Entry is by guided tour only and it is well worth visiting. The young lady who was our guide was charming as well as knowledgeable. The large warren like bunker with its spooky wax figures is quite atmospheric and one can almost sense the tension and anxiety which must have pervaded during the final days before the gut wrenching decision was made to surrender.
,,Interesting if you have spare time and like WWII history,3.0,,We ended up doing this by chance as we walked by it in Fort Canning Park and the next tour was due to start. The tour was interesting and all about the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in WWII. It took about two hours in total and made us more interested in visiting Changi prison which continues the story but we didn't have enough time. Its worth a visit if you have lots of time.
,,Hear tales underground,5.0,,"Go underground to explore the Battlebox on the Story of Strategy and Surrender tour (1 hour @ $18 per adult). A secret military command centre during the war, the underground rooms are full of intriguing tales of the events that led to the British surrendering.

Access to the Battlebox is via a tour only."
,,Walk into history,5.0,,I love history and thus this place proved to be interesting and eerie too. The mannequins can be frightening especially during rainy season. Good adventure.
,,Easily missed,5.0,,"To anyone interested in Singapore history and the second world war this is a must, it is where the last moments before Singapore fell to the Japanese was enacted.It is underground and conveys the tension that must have been felt just before the capitulation. The history of those last moments is charted and some of the leading figures in the operation are portrayed. Well worth a visit, I found that many taxi drivers did not know of it and were inclined to take you to the war memorial, if you have a problem it is situated under the local golf course."
,,Informative tour,5.0,,Very informative tour of the Battlebox given by a knowledgeable guide highlighting the suffering of Singapore during WWII. Well worth a visit.
,,Great history tour,4.0,,"Found this little tour by accident whilst wondering around Singapore.

The bottlebox itself was very interesting and the retelling of the war through the eyes of Singapore/Malay was very interesting.

The tour itself was a good price and importantly the tour guide, Eisen, was very knowledgeable and you could feel his interest (dare I say love) for the history and the role of Singapore in WW2 really came through."
,,Unsusal,5.0,,This is set in Canning Park. Part of Fort Canning. The Battlebox is where the British army planned the war on the Japanese in Singapore.. It is worth viewing especially if any relatives were involved. A guided tour takes and hour and is very well presented.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,We signed up to take the tour via Viator. Apparently we were the only ones so we had a personal tour with the guide. If you are the least bit interested in WWII or the war history of Singapore this is a must. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and did a great job.
,,Informative and interesting tour,5.0,,"Found the Battlebox tour to be informative and interesting,I would recommend it to anyone, especially those who have an interest in WW2 and the fall of Singapore. Some interesting battlefield artefacts are on display in the tour, take the time to examine these artefacts in the display case, when you arrive at them. The tour lasts about an hour and 15 minutes, all the rooms have placards describing the rooms and some have poster placards describing the fighting that went on in 1942, make time to read these as they help to understand what went on down there in 1942 as well as what the island went through."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Our docent was so knowledgeable and passionate. We learned so much - thought being an Aussie we knew a lot of Singapore's war history, but that was certainly not the case. Please visit this, you will learn so much."
,,Great insight into Singapore war history,5.0,,"As a history buff, I greatly enjoyed the tour of the bunker where critical decisions were made that changed Singapore forever. The guide was very knowledgeable and weaved an engaging narrative using the artefacts in the various rooms. The air conditioning helps to make it a comfortable tour and the place is well lit. Overall, it's worth a visit especially for veterans and history buffs."
,,Fantastic Tour,5.0,,"The guide tours last for 1.25 hours and cost $18 per adult.

Our guide (Jerome) was very knowledgable and passed the various pieces of historiical data on to us in an easy to understand way.

The easiest way, if coming by taxi, is to get them to take you to the Fort Canning Park Hotel which is right by the ticket office for this attraction"
,,"Awesome Tour such an amazing part of history, best tour guide",5.0,,From the time we met our tour guide Shar from the end of our tour he had us captivated right back in time. This is an absolute must and a very different experience. We did the Battle Box and Fort Canning guided tour and it was absolutely fantastic. The history and story behind the battle box was amazing. It also helped that our tour guide was so passionate about the battle box and the war. If you are coming to Singapore this is a must. Battle box has only just been opened and well worth it.
,,A real feel for the place in 1942,5.0,,"We were a family of 3 for visit . The tours last an hour guided by a young knowledgeable guide. after our visit we all felt we understood the last days before the fall of Singapore much better and would recommend it. It is a walking tour through over 20 underground rooms at Fort Canning interspersed with some videos which give intervals to sit down. Nearest MRT station Dhoby Gaut then walk cross the road and up the grassy hill. Booking not necessary but groups are about 20 persons.Tip: if you have just missed joining a tour and are waiting for the next, stroll up hill just past the tour entrance and relax with a refreshment at the small cafe or stroll around the older park."
,,Brilliant and Informative,5.0,,A must visit for anyone with an interest in WW2 history or the history of Singapore in general. Guided tour is the only way you can get inside but it well work the $30 odd and is very informative.
,,Battle Box Tour.,5.0,,My late father was a PoW of the Japanese so I had a personal interest in the tour which was excellent in all aspects. I was given a warm welcome at the visitor's centre and the young female presenter who conducted the tour session has really researched her stuff. I am glad that I did this tour and recommend it to anyone who may be in Singapore. Well worth the $18.00 that I was charged. No photos allowed inside bunker and I can respect this.
,,Enriching and insightful,5.0,,"I went for the trip after reading rave reviews from visitors on the WWW, and I would say I enjoyed the visit throughout.

The docent, Eisen, did not just merely took us from one spot to another. He narrated the story of what transpired at the site during that era itself, and he was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable.

He also answered some questions about WW2 that we had, and I would say I left place with a deeper insight on the fall of Singapore. Certainly worth a visit."
,,A piece of history well told in Singapore.,4.0,,"I have an interest in war history so my wife and I found our way to the Battle Box in Fort Canning Park in Singapore. The Battle Box was the the main command centre during the surrender of Singapore in the Second World War. The decision to surrender was made there. We had a great guide who was able to give us a great insight into the role of the Battlebox and the events leading up to and after the fall of Singapore.

Fort Canning Parlmitself also has plenty to offer.

A great experience but for some reason it is not well advertised. Tours take about 1.5 hours and are only conducted about 4 times a day. Well worth the effort."
,,Interesting,5.0,,"Really interesting tour that goes through singapores role in WWII and its subsequent surrender. 90% of the tour is spent in the bunker and the guides really know there stuff. You don't need to be a WWII buff to enjoy this tour, even my wifi addicted teenagers enjoyed it, good way to spend an hour and a half."
,,The Battlebox,4.0,,"We recently spent 3 days in Singapore and took in most of the popular tourist attractions. However one that isn't so well advertised is the Battlebox. This is sited in an old underground bunker in Fort Canning Park and here you can take a one and half hour guided tour of the small complex of rooms that have been adapted to show the history of Singapore during the second World War. Eisen, our guide was not only very enthusiastic but was also extremely knowledgeable. I came away feeling that whether specifically interested in military history or just having a general interest in the history of Singapore this tour was pitched in a way that satisfied both tastes. It's certainly worth a visit."
,,World War History Fall of Singapore to Japan,4.0,,"This was a guided walking tour of Fort Canning Hill. Very good guide who took the small group to sites on the hill covering history from old times through the different era's, to current time. Covered each period briefly. Then a spicy rice snack and cold drink half way thru. Included in entrance fee. 2nd half was in the reconstructed underground tunnel area with some audio visual presentations. Was interesting as it was done to show the British WWII era mainly. It fort has been used for many other purposes since WWII.
Worth the 2 1/2 hour walking tour. Check web for times of guided tours. Conducted by Tourism Singapore."
,,Fascinating,4.0,,"A really interesting and fascinating insight into the final days before the fall of Singapore in 1942. The story is told with balance, by informative and aware guides. Totally recommend the guided tour.
The bunker is well equipped and the tour is audio visual and captures the feeling of the time.
Thoroughly recommended!"
,,Unique and Fantastic,5.0,,"While there is a serious tone surrounding surrender to Japanese occupation in WW2, the bunker and tour do a fantastic job of retelling the string of events that lead to capitulation despite outnumbering the Japanese. Highly recommended if you've already done the main Singaporean attractions"
,,Historically fascinating,5.0,,"A work colleague urged me to visit Fort Canning while in Singapore. I was unaware of the Battlebox until we were walking around there. Went back the next day to do the guided tour. Our tour guide was both engaging and entertaining. This is the place where the officials made the heartbreaking decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese. The exhibits displayed the anguish those men must have felt. Would have loved a bit more time to absorb more of the exhibits, particularly the written articles on the walls. We arrived early for the first tour and found that there was only one other couple with us. I would recommend trying to do this as it made for a specialised experience."
,,So glad I toured The Battlebox - it's a 'must see',5.0,,"I visited The Battlebox years ago, and am glad to see it has reopened.
During a recent trip to Singapore The Battlebox was a ‘must do’ and I’m so glad I took the tour. Our guide Sharul gave a very informed presentation, including his personal link to WWII.
At the end of the tour I talked with Sharul about the 2/19 Battalion and the battle in which my great-uncle was killed, and he suggested a book I should chase for more information."
,,Great historical aspect of Singapore,5.0,,"We went on this tour after it was recommended by a friend. The tour takes you into the bunker/battle box where the Malay Campaign was planned. The tour was really interesting, with great models and artefacts to look at as well as videos. If anything, it would have been great to have a bit more time in the rooms to read the display boards. Better signage to find the Information Centre would be REALLY helpful! An insightful tour showing a different side of Singapore."
,,Great guided tour-,5.0,,"We came to Singapore to visit my dad and he was so excited to see the reopening of the battle box and take myself and my partner to see it.

I had very little knowledge of Singapore in WWII and the tour was great for a newbie to the history like me.

My dad loved it and the tour guide was informative and extremely passionate which added a very human element to the experience.

She presented a well balanced tour covering the historical facts, but brought the story to life by talking about the personalities and relationships of the key decision makers. She also relayed her own families experience as civilians at this time.

I considered this tour as a an opportunity to reflect and remember the devastation of war affected Singapore and experience the isolation and living conditions felt in the battle box.

Would highly recommend for those who want to learn about the history and experience something unique!

Thanks for a wonderful tour!

Cheers,

Jess

Ps. There were 2x arrogant fat old men on our tour- one of which interrupted our guide to inappropriately boast his knowledge - which she was going to be covering in the next room...

One of them put a complaint in the box- I wanted to let the owners know that it was a ridiculous complaint about our tour guide not covering obscure information about the wider war- not specific to the battle box.

Would suggest if your going on a guided tour to not be a jerk and ask genuine questions if you have them- not interrupt the tour for everyone else."
,,A tour not to be missed,5.0,,"Very insightful to what happened during WWII in Malaya and Singapore. Our guide, Eisen, was fantastic and my son was as kept entertained the whole tour."
,,Forget Garden by the Bay - The Battlebox is Best in Singapore,5.0,,"My girlfriend and I spent 5 nights in Singapore and did what felt like the whole city. Two highlights stood out - the Botanical Gardens and The Battlebox.

The Battlebox tells the history of Singapore focusing on the events of World War II - the Box itself is where the British took the decision to surrender to the Japanese in 1942.

You have to visit on a guided tour - there are between 3 and 5 a day depending on which day you go, more on Mondays. Just turn up at the visitor's office at Canning Fort - we talk a short walk uphill from Dhoby Ghaut MRT station - and if there isn't a tour starting soon you can kill some time in the nearby Art Centre or its cafes.

Our guide Jey (which he explained means ""victory"" in Sanksrit) was knowledgeable and passionate in equal measure. The tour was scheduled for 90 minutes but took 15 minutes longer - it didn't feel like it, fascinating throughout.

The best thing you can do in Singapore

Plus you can spend a lot more time walking round Canning Hill. We didn't - too hot. And lazy."
,,Engaging and Interesting Tour,5.0,,"This tour of the Battlebox at Fort Canning had been recommended by friends and it did not disappoint. Anyone with relatives who fought in WWII, especially the Asia/Pacific, will feel an attachment to the wartime stories and history and the momentous role the Battlebox played in the fall of Singapore. The tour is well done - our guide Nancy was particularly good. We did the first tour of the day (at 9.30am) and we had a small group (6 people). The next group we saw had more like 26. Fair to say the tour is more for adults. Fort Canning is a pleasant precinct in its own right. Well worthwhile."
,,History revealed.,5.0,,Absolutely essential visit to Singapore. Get the feel of what these people went through in a very traumatic and hopeless situation. The alternative cost to surrender would have been so much higher. Bloody Churchill.
,,Fascinating insight into the history of Singapore,5.0,,"The tour of the Battle Box is a fascinating and interesting experience and definitely well worth a visit. Our guide was absolutely brilliant and obviously was passionate about her subject which made the visit both fun and informative.
We would definitely recommend this to any visitor to Singapore who is interested in the Island's wartime history."
,,Great tour and very good waxwork figures,4.0,,The guided tour is a brilliant introduction to the purpose of the Battlebox but also throws light onto the personalities of the leaders of the opposing armies in the conflict that culminated in Feb 1941 with the biggest surrender of armed forces in the British Empire's history
,,Must Do in Singapore!,5.0,,"Can highly recommend this guided tour of the underground Far East Command HQ of the British Forces during the fall of Singapore in WWII.
Professional guides explained clearly what happened and why Singapore was such a strategically important spot on the globe before, during and after the war.
Dioramas with life size wax figures in historically correct representation, original film footage shows, lots of memorabilia, aplus ancient artifacts discover while digging these tunnels ( as Fort Canning was the Forbidden City belonging to the Singapura Kings centuries ago!) make this tour so worthwhile!
Take a walk through Ft Canning Park while you are there; the Heritage trees and lush spice garden are also amazing!"
,,Battle of Singapore story compromised,4.0,,"I came along to this exhibit to see for myself what had happened here during the historic occurrences of WW2.
The Battlebox is within the precincts of Fort Canning,where there is also a reservoir which supplies Singapore central with its water. A beautiful park also sets off the whole area.
I paid my entrance fee ($18), had a great tour of the facility along with a number of other tourists and we were hosted by a tour guide who gave a very good account of this epic place.
However I was very annoyed to be told ""no photos"", but ""we"" have some lovely photos that you can purchase.Ok, I fully realize that a private company no doubt set the place up for all the world to see and learn, but a place of such significant should be a place where one can take photos.The photos I have provided are from ""uncle"" Google!"
,,Battle box visit,5.0,,"My husband and I visited this attraction this afternoon and we both really enjoyed it,finding it informative and interesting .Our guide was excellent , a definitive must if you are interested in modern history and the shaping of Singapore."
,,Make sure this is on your itinerary!!!,5.0,,"An incredible tour that, quite literally, goes deep into the fall of Singapore during WWII as you enter the Battlebox itself!! I unexpectedly ended up visiting the battlebox twice and enjoyed it just as much the second time as the first time.

I wholly recommend the tour ""Of Graves, Guns and Battles"" as it takes in the pre-WWII history of Singapura, the malay kings and early colonial days and sets the historical backdrop to WWII and Singapore's independence. A great visitor shop and terrific guides (special thanks to Nancy, Joanne, Wui Wui and Sharul - you guys are awesome!!) will make this a unforgettable experience!!"
,,Fantastic Tour,5.0,,"The Battlebox has just been restored, June 2016, and is an excellent place to visit. Our guide was so very knowledgeable, she captivated our small group. We leant a great deal from her and her talk was interspersed with short video clips of original war material. Fantastic visit."
,,Superb History,5.0,,"Excellent guided tour of a significant historical place and event.
The docents did a super job of placing the events in historical context. The tour starts with a primer on early Singapore history and continues through to the landmark events during WWII. The aural and visual history presented by the docents, film clips and the battle-ax itself are a real treat for anyone interested in 20th century events.
This was well worth the time and admission."
,,A new experience,5.0,,"The Battlebox opened to the public fairly recently. The guide was very informative and answered all our questions. Interesting to see how the British transformed the hillside into a big underground bunker with numerous rooms and passages, and the human figures in various rooms were incredibly life-like and matched the facial details of the photos of the real people who operated in the bunker until the surrender to the Japanese in 1942. Very enlightening but also sad."
,,MAGNIFICENT HISTORY,5.0,,The Battlebox is a fabulous re-discovery (1988) and restoration (2016). Dug out under a grassy hill in 1932 it was used by the British prior to the fall of Singapore and formed part of what was then Fort Canning but now a testimony to Singapore's WW2 history. It is a must visit for anyone and the guides are very well-learned - we had Jerome who was a very young Singaporean with a wealth of knowledge and history to pass on to the tour participants. The rarely seen videos of the time are enthralling. You will walk out knowing more than you realised or thought you knew. Do yourself a favour.............go there.
,,Rainy day visit,5.0,,Surprisingly this is full of very interesting information which is well presented and not dour or boring ... The whole set up Is very well done and quite humorous at times
,,Definitely worth a visit!,5.0,,"I argued with my wife over this one saying that it was just another bunker! Sigh - turns out that the wife is right again! It's actually a really very interesting tour that is packed full of facts and figures about how the Brits came to surrender during WWII. Having toured the surrounding hill and gardens earlier in the week we had no idea what was underneath! Give it a go, you will be glad you did!"
,,Very informative,4.0,,Learned a lot about the period up to and including the Allied surrender of Singapore. Nancy our guide was very knowledgeable and patient. The visit was first class.
,,History Continued,4.0,,"Recently opened in June this year, the Battlebox is a tour of the Allied Forces command bunker during the battle for Singapore against the Japenese. With recently released defence information, the tour covers the reasons for the fall of Singapore to the Japenese and the failure of British military stratergy to provision Singapore with the proper defences and resources. The tour lasts about 75 minutes and demonstrates that the allies had no choice but to surrender to protect loss of innocent civilian lives. The only downside is that there is not sufficient time given to read all the material posted around. Maybe once it is established fully then unguided visits maybe allowed or more time given to read the material on display."
,,Of historical interest,5.0,,"Thoroughly enjoyed touring the bunkers and learning the details of Singapore's surrender to the Japanese. Great guide with excellent knowledge of events. If interested in military history, the Battlebox is a must see."
,,Fascinating story,5.0,,This underground bunker has been well restored to tell the story of the surrender of Singapore in WW2 assisted by a couple of good videos and an informative guide. Good level of detail and very factual.
,,An Enlightening Delight,5.0,,"As a serving member of HM Forces I have just returned from a group visit to this superb place with a comprehensive understanding of how a British military loss (which we are not good at talking about at the best of times) totally shaped the Singapore we know today. Eisen, our tour guide, could not have been more enthusiastic, knowledgeable and engaging. I suspect there are a significant number of people who travel through, regularly work or holiday in Singapore who have no concept of why it is the way it is today; I was one of them. The use of videos, artifacts, guide knowledge and pictures all combined to give a really tangible feel for what life was like during a critical phase of the war in Malaya/Singapore circa 1942. Hugely impressed with the whole set up and I would very strongly recommend a visit if you're in Singapore, even if museums and tours are not normally your thing. You will be enlightened without a shadow of a doubt."
,,A hidden gem,5.0,,"Not knowing much about the military history of this region I decided to visit the Battlebox to find out a little more concerning the surrender of Singapore by the British to the Japanese in WWII.

We were guided around the site by the hugely knowledgeable and wonderfully enthusiastic Eisen who truly brought the whole experience to life. His passion for the subject matter was infectious and he was able to offer as much or as little detail as the tour needed.

I cannot recommend this enough - a must for anyone who wants to understand this island and its tumultuous past."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Absolutely loved this! The guide was very informative and knowledgeable about the events which occurred at Fort Canning, and it was really interesting being inside the same tunnels and rooms where events that changed the world actually occurred. We did this tour in the morning, then a tour of Changi in the afternoon to pop off our ""History Day"" in Singapore - both tours were fabulous and 110% recommended."
,,Excellent insightful tour,5.0,,"We had not previously heard of this tour but it was mentioned while we were on the hop on hop off bus in Singapore, so we thought it would be an interesting tour to do. It turned out to be a wonderful, if not slightly distressing, insight into the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese. Our wonderful guide was Joanne whose knowledge and presentation was outstanding. Some of the people on the tour had great understanding of the war and she was able to answer all questions and provide great insight. The bunker has been well restored and is obviously being set up for self guided tours. There are impactful short films, original artifacts and replicas which all create a great view of what it was like at the time. It was a great 1.5 hours. We highly recommend this tour."
,,Excellent,5.0,,We did the 11am tour with Eisen today and excellent-very informative and for WW2 history buffs great to learn more about the conflict here. Very well organised and a good way to spend and hour on a very rainy day. Recommended
,,Highlight of our visit!,5.0,,"My husband and I visited Battlebox at Canning on the second last day of our holiday and it was the highlight of our Singapore trip.

The 1 hour tour was informative as well as engaging. Shamrul, our guide, was excellent in giving his presentation. It was punchy, well paced, while injecting humour and a little of his own family's experience during the war.

One doesn't have to be a history buff to appreciate this tour.

A definite must see while in Singapore!"
,,Outstanding facility and a World Class Tour,5.0,,"Battlebox at Fort Canning Park is a must-do tour. I would rate it in my Top 10 To-Do tours around the world. The tour guide for our group was excellent and very knowledgeable. She was also extremely friendly and was always happy to answer questions. The standout element was how the tour-guide wove, excerpts that she had heard from visiting guests, history books in school and interesting snippets she had read, into the tour effortlessly.
The way the Battlebox has been renovated and maintained speaks a lot about the famous Singaporean 'no-nonsense/efficient' approach. The tour offers a peek into the atrocities of war and for the emotional hearted individuals like me, I recommend that you carry tissues, the third and last video at The Battlebox is akin to a heavy stone falling onto your heart and before you know it, your eyes might well up with tears. The tour ends with a quiz where you can win a replica of an object or document of historical importance to Singapore. The tour guide also recommends the participants to check-out the Changi Museum in case one would like to learn more about the history of Singapore.
Tours cost Singapore Dollar 18 and you must retain your tickets until the tour starts. There are five tours on all days except Mondays and public holidays when there are only three tours."
,,Engaging and Informative,5.0,,"My family went on the 11am tour last Saturday and it was time very well spent. Our guide, Eisen Teo from the Singapore History Consultants, was an absolute fountain of knowledge which he delivered in an interesting and engaging way. He managed to interest my two children (8 & 9) to the point that they asked thoughtful questions, as well as keeping the dialogue at an adult level to engage the rest of the group. The tour should have been 1-1.25 hours; in fact, we ended up spending 1.5 hours as there was so much to talk about. The tour was an interesting mix of short videos, looking at replica and real artefacts and photos and the talks given by Eisen. The Battle Box itself is a wartime command bunker comprising about 28 rooms - we saw about 10. Eventually, I think the plan is to make it self guided so I recommend you go now to enjoy the high quality tour delivered by someone with a genuine interest in WWII history. Fantastic!"
,,Interesting Tour for History/WW2 Buffs,5.0,,"I read some good reviews about the Battlebox tour on TripAdvisor and decided to sign up for the 1:30 pm slot on a Thursday afternoon. I was not disappointed! Our guide Sharul took us on a tour through several chambers, each furnished the way they could have been during WW2. During each stop, he talked about the events leading up to the Japanese occupation of Singapore. The batch that I toured with was very engaged, and had some good questions for our guide, which he answered throughout the tour. The tour lasts 1 to 1.5 hours depending on the group's pace. SGD 18 allows you to enter a hidden bunker located in Fort Canning Park, through a guided tour. There are several tours at fixed schedules throughout the day, so best to plan your visit around it.

Other tips:
Photography is not allowed inside the bunker.
I would not recommend this tour for those travelling with young children or babies as they might get restless during the tour.
The Battlebox visitor center is situated a short walk from the Fort Canning exit of The National Museum of Singapore. You could visit the National Museum for a few hours, exit at its topmost level and walk up to Fort Canning Park in time for one of the afternoon tours. Or you could do the opposite (Battlebox then the National Museum).
It is cool inside the bunker, so those who get cold easily should bring a light jacket or cardigan."
,,Insightful and informative,5.0,,"I really enjoyed the tour, our guide Kel was informative and told the story so very well. We visited multiple rooms, saw a couple of videos and Kel explained the events with perfect detail. Highly recommend."
,,Wonderful and informative,5.0,,"Our guide Sharul really made the tour - it was well paced, interesting and definitely worth a visit. For history buffs and general tourists alike, was very interesting and engaging and not at all boring like some historical tours can be. Definitely recommend!!"
,,Fantastic for those who want a true insight into some of the history of Singapore.,5.0,,"This is a great tour of the bunker at Fort canning. I do recommend the guided tour, our tour guide ""Shar"" was excellent and extremely knowledgeable. You do not get the same information and experience when just reading from boards. We would go again when we next visit. Definitely exceeded our expectations, mostly down to the tour guide and the information."
,,Great tour for those with an interest in WW2,5.0,,"Located on Fort Canning near the hotel this is an interesting tour of the nerve centre for operations during the Japanese invasion of Singapore. Tour guide was informative and paced the tour well.
Tour lasts just over an hour and came away having learnt lots and got a real feel for what it may have been like at the time."
,,Insightful and Engaging,5.0,,"This tour through the original bunkers where the battle for Malaya and Singapore was planned and the decision to surrender made is well executed, interesting and engaging. Excellent value on all fronts."
,,Incredible...Exceeded Expectations...,5.0,,"This is an amazing location...but the tour guide is what put it over the top. It kills me that I do not remember her name, but she did the 11:00 tour on Oct 2.

The location is absolutely fascinating and the commentary adds so much context and insight. There are several short films, dioramas, signs in English, and again...the tour guide. The tour lasts about an hour, but we went over...which was awesome. It's also air conditioned.

I can't recommend this enough...possibly one of the best things I have done here other than eat!"
,,Enjoyed,4.0,,"Very educational, good for kids to learn about history of Singapore. Tour guide Nancy was very good with children and knowledgeable. Bit long for our 4 year old but that's to be expected."
,,Very moving experience at Battlebox.,5.0,,An excellent guide took us round this underground bunker where the top brass met to decide on tactics for the defence of Singapore in WW2 and ultimately surrender to the Japanese. We moved from room to room in the bunker and saw original newsreel films. There were tears in a few people's eyes when we saw the film of the humiliation of the British and Australian and Indian troops having to line the streets of Singapore and stand to attention while the Japanese drove into the city. An excellent walk through history!
,,Battlebox tour sensational,5.0,,Thank you to our expert guide Mr Eisen Teo. I think the tour should keep a guide as it would not be as good if it where to change to self guided and would lose its appeal. My Grandfather Mr Robert Lindner served in 8th Division and was in hospital when his mates were sent to Singapore. The tour has a special connection to us. Thank you again Mr Teo for your enthusiasm and attention to detail.
,,The highlight of my holiday,5.0,,This guided tour was the highlight of my holiday in Singapore. I didn't have any prior knowledge about the Battle of Singapore but this tour was perfect. It gave me an insight into a very important event in WWII history without it ever feeling like I was in a lecture. I've got to give special mention to our guide Sharul who was brilliant. So knowledgeable with a real knack for presenting the tour in an informative and enjoyable way.
,,Battlebox Fall of Singapore Tour,5.0,,Excellent tour lead by Eisen of Singapore History Consultants. Very balanced account of the history of the Fall of Singapore and surrender. Perfect length for teenagers.
,,Enriching and amazing war history experience.,5.0,,"It was a warm and humid day walking and exploring around the beautiful Fort Canninng area. We came across the opening of the bunker and chose to purchase tickets for the Battlebox tour to get out of the stifilng heat and see what it felt like to be inside a real wartime relic. My wife brother his girlfriend and I were not dissapointed. The tour was run by a very well spoken and informative Singaporean who was well versed in the early war history of Singapore. I cannot say this enough, this is one of the best things to do in Singapore. Make time for this - you won't be dissapointed."
,,Well organised and interesting,5.0,,"A very informative experience in the middle of a beautiful, peaceful park. Our guide Shariul was very knowledgeable and made the historical experience very worthwhile. We did the hour and 15 minute tour. Quite walk from below but once at Battlebox itself easy to get around in the tunnels. Very glad we did this - gives a very good sense of Singapore history."
,,Awesome,5.0,,It was a great tour. There were parts which were heart wrenching and I had to reach for my tissues. Sharul was a superb guide. I would recommend to everyone. I will never forget this tour.
,,Interesting And Informative Summary of 7000 yrs of Fort Canning and Battlebox,5.0,,"My family of four, including a 4 & 6yo attended the 2:00pm. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The tour guide was very informative and kept our group interested for the entire 2.5 hr walk. Had a half hour experienceing the food tastes to cool down."
,,Great tour,5.0,,We were taken around this underground bunker by our very knowledgable guide ?shural (I apologise for the bad spelling) who took us through the events leading to Singapore's fall during the war. It dispelled some of the myths surrounding this episode in history and takes place in the rooms where the military commanders had to make the decision to surrender to the Japanese forces. You do need to book the tour although we just turned up and got on the next one after half an hour allowing us to look around the park above.
,,For history buffs!,4.0,,"If you are interested in Singapore's fall to Japan in WW2 visit the Battlebox. It is always interesting to see the actual place where history happened and not just read about it. The staff was really well informed and eager to share her knowledge. Unfortunately, you cannot take pictures inside the bunker. The tour has to be booked in advance and is not a self-guided one."
,,Amaxinb,5.0,,"We did the escorted tour into the battle box and it was well worth it.
I learnt a lot about the history of Singapore.
When I go back it is definitely something I will be taking my son to. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and engaging throughout the whole tour."
,,"Must see, hear and experience visit",5.0,,This is an excellent example of both the military and personal history of Singapore leading up to and during WWII our guide Shar was incredibly knowledgeable of the military history but also kind enough to share his family history with us. I can't recommend a visit enough.
,,Historic,5.0,,"This is a great place to find out about Singapore's not too distant history. A fort built to protect inner Singapore, but obviously failed cos the Japs came by land and screwed up all plans by the Brits. It's a nice fort to visit and you will find some adventure wandering through the maze. Read up on history books before coming, so as to heighten the meaningful trip."
,,"A very interesting hour, and left me with desire to find more",5.0,,"The Battlebox reopened in June 2016, and so as a regular visitor to Singapore on business I was interested to visit and see more about the Second World War history of Singapore.

Set in a location within Fort Caning Park, the Battlebox in easy to find. Access is only by guided tour, and Nancy, our guide set the scene when we met her so that we had some ideas of the background to the history of the Battlebox.

A thoroughly interesting 1 and 1/4 hour tour followed during which I learnt more about the history of Singapore in the War than I did at school history lessons.

Off the the National Museum and the Asian Civilisation Museum to find out more.

Highly recommended."
,,Remembering WWII in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a wonderful restoration of the bunker used by the British, Indian, Malaysian and Australian Armed Forces as their Command Center.

Life size mannequins dressed in military uniforms present the Battle & Surrender of Singapore along with movie and documentary clips.

This huge defeat and put ultimate surrender was made necessary by a lack of aircraft, ships and tanks, all of which the smaller Japanese military brought to bear upon the defenders of Singapore.

The tour is conducted by excellent staff at the site. Make sure you arrive for one of the scheduled tours, the last of which is at 4 PM. There is no access without being in a tour."
,,Very interesting history of Singapore,5.0,,"A really great tour which explores the fall of Singapore during WW2. The tour guide is extremely knowledgeable about the island's history and explains a lot throughout the tour.

A definite must-see if you like WW2 history, and you can follow this up with a nice walk in the park or a relaxed lunch at Hotel Fort Canning."
,,Interesting visit,5.0,,After a lovely walk round Fort Canning Park we came upon the visitor centre for the Battlebox and opted to take the guided tour. Took about 90 minutes and was an excellent insight into Singapore surrendering to the Japanese and everything that took place before and after. The guided tours are being stopped once all the rooms are renovated after flooding - a shame because I think the guided tour was much more interesting than just wandering around on your own. The guide was very informative and interesting.
,,Battlebox Museum,5.0,,A must place to visit while in Singapore. Complete tour takes approximately an hour and 15 minutes with an excellent and enthusiastic guide.
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,"This new attraction is well worth the visit. Our guide Joanne was able to explain a complex series of events so they were easily understood and gave perspective to Singapore's history. I thoroughly enjoyed it and the time went so quickly. The blend of video, narratives and visual displays gave a thorough understanding of this sad time in history.
After this I went out to the Changi museum which continued the same story. A great day and would highly recommend."
,,Useful slice of history,4.0,,"This was well worth a visit, and very useful to give context of the history of Singapore. The topic was handled well and constructively. Only thing, tour a good 20mins to long, lots of repeated info, we started to feel uncomfortable."
,,day trip,5.0,,"Wax figurines are real life looking. With a good description of the actual incident in the war room, and audio presentation too. A must for WWII fans."
,,Last stand at the Battle Box Fort Canning,5.0,,"The walk up through the beautiful Fort Canning Park takes you to the underground bunker which forms the heart of Singapore's historic military defences. The guided tour I took was conducted by an extremely knowledgable young lady who explained the history of the Battle Box. The labyrinth of tunnels and rooms have been decorated in a similar fashion to Winston Churchill's War Room in London and much of the original WW 2 memorabilia adorn the various offices and corridors. If you have any interest in the Fall of Singapore, the Battle Box is well worth the trip up the hill."
,,On a par with any European war museum,5.0,,"This recently renovated bunker museum fills a critical gap in the Singapore history telling. On a par with London's cabinet war rooms or Verdun's Fort Vaux, this is an extremely well presented history of Singapore's WW2 surrender and the true story of why it fell - rarely discussed either in England or in Singapore. The tour is professionally run with video footage and photos not seen in other museums in Singapore or elsewhere. You are left to ponder whether General Percival and his 11 officers meeting in the bunker box should have launched a counter-attack against the Japanese rather than surrendering."
,,"Highly recommended for both tourists & locals, a crucial part of Singapore's history",5.0,,"The revamped Battlebox is nothing short of amazing..! Blending a smorgasbord of history, the timeless art of story-telling, combined with visual and audio treats, you descend 30 feet into the heart of a legendary hill which played a crucial part in the ill-fated battle of Singapore.
Discovered by accident not too long ago as workers were clearing up dense foliage on Fort Canning, the Battlebox served as an uber-bunker for the Allied command during the siege of Singapore by the advancing Japanese. Battles around the island were monitored from here and till this day you see reminders of the men that served within, ranging from ventilation slates crudely cut into the reinforced doors to graffiti in the toilets. Thankfully it is now fully-airconditioned and comfortable to walk around, a far cry from the sweltering, over-crowded days of its wartime usage.
I'm an avid follower of history, primarily military history and had visited the previous Battlebox which had since closed. When I read in the newspapers that the Battlebox has been revamped by a company known for its historical tours, I contacted them and attended one of their soft-launch tours.
While on the tour you will see the actual rooms defined by their use, historical artifacts and a movie clip with rarely seen footage. I have to say, the bunker itself is a sight to behold. Solid engineering for its time.
Physical attributes aside, the Battlebox tells an amazing story of Singapore's darkest hours. Led by experienced guides with interesting anecdotes along the way, they start the story at the entrance of the bunker and as you go deeper underground, room to room, the story too weaves its way with tales of tragedy and heroism. Such is the pull of a good story-teller and few places have them.
Even if history is not your thing, I highly recommend it to any tourist or local for half a day or even a full day visit; besides the Battlebox and its lovely visitor centre, there's Fort Canning and its historical grounds, a hotel beside it that was also a building of WW2 significance and a short walk away leads you to the other historical places and eateries in the Civic district
The tour ends back at the surface, where you come out of bomb-proof doors into the peaceful greenery of the park. By then you will be filled with a sense of awe and respect for what happened to our little island in 1942, and pray that war never comes to anyone or any country."
,,Excellent historic tour,5.0,,"We would thoroughly recommend this tour for anyone who is a history buff. In a city where shopping seems to be the #1 focus it's nice to see there are some alternative activities like the battlebox.
The tour guide was very knowledgable and really seemed to be passionate about the history of his country."
,,Must Do on Any Visit to Singapore,5.0,,"The Battlebox is the underground bunker system on top of Canning Hill that was the British Command Headquarters at the outbreak of World War Two.

It was here that General Percival and his allied commanders and senior staff officers planned the Defence of Singapore against Japanese invasion and where they eventually made the decision to surrender to the Japanese.

Today the bunker system has been reopened and tableaux with look-alike wax figures at command conferences, in the signals room and the aircraft spotting room.

Guided tours are S$18 and take about 90 minutes. Our guide, Joanne, had an amazing knowledge of all the events surrounding the Japanese invasion, the British Defence strategies, and the painful decision making process that lead to the surrender of what was previously thoughtt to be ""impregnable Singapore"". Not only did she deliver a highly informative narrative, but was able to answer even the most obscure questions with only a second's thought."
,,A must do when in Singapore,5.0,,This really is a must do experience. Extremely interesting with a knowledgeable guide who spoke excellent english. Being in the rooms where the allied surrender was decided upon and understanding the thought processes of General Percival and his staff was fascinating. This is a historical place that is appealing to everyone from young adult upwards and was also good value for money.
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"Well set out with displays including life size figures and Video clips. Guide was very informative about this important phase in Singapore's history,and better than a hand held commentary that was offered several years ago. It is good to know that the attraction has undergone a revitalization and has now reopened to the public. Well worth the admission price and highly recommended."
,,Tour of the Battle Box,5.0,,"This tour far exceeded my expectations. The bunker itself has been brought back to life as it was in 1942 and not over-restored. Our guide Eisen was extremely knowledgeable and personable, presenting an educated and objective view. A small group of visitors who asked so may questions that the tour went for 90 minutes. A ""must see"" for any visitor to Singapore."
,,Hidden Historic Area.,5.0,,"We didn't know much about the events prior to the fall of Singapore and certainly didn't know about the Battle Box. Here huge decisions were made that changed the course of history. We paid $18 a head ( good value) for a guided tour through the 18 or so rooms buried beneath the hill. Our guide Eisen was enthusiastic and very knowledgeable. He carefully explained the events leading up to the decision and we were able to watch some short video clips, look at artefacts in the rooms including mannequins of the key men. In time this will become an interpretive walk. Highly recommended for history buffs."
,,Great museum and tour,5.0,,"Eisen was our knowledgeable and enthusiastic guide on a trip down into the original bunker used during WW2 by Lt Gen Percival! The tour brings this historic monument alive and is definitely worth visiting. The tour was an hour and a quarter in total, and I learnt some new things."
,,Battle box Tour,5.0,,"Information presented in a confident, concise but informative way. V enjoyable well structured and interesting."
,,A World Water Experience,4.0,,"We read about the Battlebox in a tourist handbook and leaflet and it was close to our hotel. We enjoyed an inexpensive 45 minute tour of this British Military Underground Command Centre with its various offices with most of the equipment, maps, furniture & posters still in place. Wartime action films were shown coupled with an interesting guid talk on the invasion by the Japanese. Well worth a visit."
,,Very educational,5.0,,We visited on the recommendation of a friend who lives in Singapore and we were not disappointed. Kids and adults alike learned a lot about how WW2 played out in Singapore. The guide was great too.
,,Battle Box - WW2 tour - Fort Canning - When time and Logistics are against you.,4.0,,"Young Eisen led our tour of the Battlebox. His knowledge and passion for history was refreshing. This was a very informative tour of military command, and scrifice. The battle box is laid out with some historical items, archive information and actual manikins in situ as they were in history. The information about the Malaysian and Singaporean peoples plight during WW2 is brief and to the point. I'm Austrailian and enjoyed hearing about the role the Aussies played in Singapore.
The tour is well run by young people with a passion for history. Our tour was a small group and went for about an 1 hour and 15 mins. Cost was $S18, and started on time."
,,"Superb gem, fascinating WW2 tour",5.0,,"The tour was really interesting, well presented, friendly, on time, and well worth the $18. The organisers have diligently preserved and restored history. We did the 1hr 15mins tour and it was an excellent overview."
,,Fantastic: a very detailed tour of the entire facility,5.0,,"Whether you are a WW2 history freak or just a normal tourist, the Battlebox must be on your to-do list for Singapore.

The Japanese capture of Singapore was one of the biggest events in WW2's asian theater, and a visit to this intact complex bunker system provides for an unusual chance of time-travelling.

The facility is in pristine condition and very well equipped, the tour guides are extremely knowledgeable and friendly and can answer even the nerdiest of questions.

Absolute top-notch. I wish we had such well preserved sites in Europe."
,,An insightful tour of a painful military decision,5.0,,This tour around a military command bunker provides the background information and conditions leading to the allied surrender of Singapore to the Japanese on the 15 February 1942. The tour was provided by a very knowledgeable guide who had studied the history and background of the people involved in the decisions so was well placed to answer any question posed.
,,History WW2,5.0,,"We stayed at the Hotel Fort Canning recently and noticed doors into the hillside from our window.
After investigating we discovered the Battlebox and its visitor centre. This was used by the British as a command centre during WW2 until the Japanese defeat of Singapore, and it was here that the decision was made to surrender.
It is only available to view through a guided tour, which is good value at S$18 which also helps maintain the area.
This command centre was lost in the encroaching jungle over the hill for over 40 years, and is now being restored by the current managers.
This was a fascinating history of the advance of the Japanese Imperial Forces through Malaya and Singapore until the end of WW2. Some of the photographs and newsreel footage are an incredible record of the times.
This is a fantastic place to visit for anyone interested in the history of the time."
,,An interesting look into singapores past which will reawaken your inner historian!,5.0,,"This little tucked away gem is not to be missed. We had an amazing tour guide who gave us a very factual account of the fall of Singapore to the Japanese, detailing all the tactics and decisions on both sides that led to the surrender of Singapore. The visual cues inside the bunker are amazing and the characters so lifelike you feel like the generals are there as you travel on this historic journey. I found myself wishing I was a fly on the wall for the 15minute meeting of the 12 key leaders who finally conceded defeat inside this bunker and was blown away to think I was standing inside such a historical venue. With little interest previously in history I know yearn to understand more of the battles and key characters and individual country involvements in the world wars."
,,Definitely worth a visit,4.0,,"We both found this tour interesting, our guide ""Jerome"" was a wealth of honest and accurate information and not a British basher just the truth which is easily loss these days."
,,Fascinating Insights.,5.0,,"Well worth every one of the 18 dollars. 9.45am tour on a Saturday. A very pleasant American chap and me only, with our delightful guide and goldmine of information, Joanne.
Lovely visitor centre and ticket office selling excellent books and a good range of quality souveniers. Everything has recently reopened after refurbishment and the whole of the underground complex is fully air conditioned and well lit.
The audiovisual displays are brilliantly done with loads of excellent archive film footage and very informative and clear commentaries. The display rooms with waxwork figures are very powerful indeed and the range of wall mounted maps, diagrams and photos could easily take another hour to study. Maybe there will be more time for this on my next visit..
Wonderful, many thanks."
,,Much improved,5.0,,"The Battle Box has been closed for over two years while they renovated it and the wait has been worthwhile. Rather than walk around on your own, you now have a guide (in my case a young student who was both knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his subject). There are more artefacts to see and a number of short, but informative, videos that explain the background to the battle for Singapore, the battle itself (and the momentous decision taken in the Battle Box to surrender), and the aftermath."
,,Battlebox Singapore,5.0,,Excellent tour by well informed guide. Set up inside the bunker with wax models of main characters as they were in the last days before the surrender of Singapore. The whole experience was quite emotional as it was so easy to imagine what it would have been like for these men.
,,Bringing the past to life,5.0,,"With recreations of the key rooms where the surrender discussions were held and an excellent guide to steer you round, this was an excellent and informative tour that brought the past to life. Children and Adults could enjoy and learn and imagine themselves back in 1942. A really terrific attraction for anyone interested in history"
,,Battle Box Tour - Well Worth The Visit,5.0,,The Battlebox is a fascinating piece of history. Not only from a WW2 perspective but also from an engineering point of view. The only thing that would have enhanced this tour would have been the ability to take photos. Unfortunately the tour company does not allow personal photos to be taken.
,,Gordon Bennett - what a surprise!,5.0,,"A generous 1hr15 min guided tour made this trip a real bargain. Singapore history was brought to life in a focused lesson on this little known wartime event. Still in early development the venue deserves to be better known and will be even better in the future as exhibits come on stream.
75 minutes and we still did not see it all!
And Gordon Bennett? Australian General who Ave his name to a very English expression of surprise - and delight!"
,,Great Tour,5.0,,"This is an absolute must-see for history buffs, particularly if you're interested in learning about Singapore during WWII. Our tour guide was thorough and informative. The cooler temperature underground was a nice break from the heat. The grounds all around are beautiful."
,,Great for history buffs,4.0,,"I took the shorter 1 hour tour of just the bunker. There is a longer tour going outside as well.

The guide was really enthusiastic and knowledgeable, and the tour included 3 films and various points to give us more context for what he was explaining.

I would definitely recommend this if you're interested in WW2 or Singapore history. I vaguely knew what had happened, but this really brought it alive.

Couple of things to note:

- at the moment it's guided tour only so check the times online, otherwise you'll have a wait.

- no photos allowed, which is a shame.

- the ticket office, gift shop, and the bunker are air conditioned!

- the rest of the park is lovely to walk around if you do have to wait for your tour time.

- loos are in the arts centre about 100 yards away."
,,Unfortunately no time for tour,4.0,,I love the history of the war so set out and had a pleasant walk to the destination. It is set amongst lovely grounds. I was disappointed to be told it would take 1 1/2 to 2 hours for the tour. I hadn't left enough time as I wasn't aware I had to book a tour.
,,Engaging and gripping tour,5.0,,"Our guide was fantastic - well spoken, considerate, thoroughly researched, and entertaining. The tour put to rest old myths and unveiled interesting facts surrounding the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese by the allied forces during WWII."
,,Lovely Park Setting,5.0,,"At I mentioned in my review of the Swisshotel Stamford which is next to Raffles and Chimes) this was only about a 20 minute walk from my hotel. We visited about 5 years ago and I wanted to see it again. Its a reminder a bit like Raffles of a bygone era and a very important part of Singapore's history. I find some locals dont seem to value their WWII history but I find it fascinating.
Well narrated by the well dressed guide who was very knowledgeable. Not a tour for youngsters.
About 15-20 minute walk to Clark Quay. Next time we go back we will do the longer tour. Highly recommend."
,,A 'Must' for WW II buffs,5.0,,"Located in Fort Canning Park, Battlebox is an excellent place to visit for those especially interested in the history of the WW II era. Our guide, Jerome, was extremely knowledgeable about all aspects of that era of history and the world-changing dilemmas faced by those in that command post. To me this is one of the highlights in Singapore and definitely worth a visit. If the other guides are a fraction as enthusiastic as Jerome, you will be pleased you went!"
,,Battle box Singapore,5.0,,"This is a brilliant presentation of the fall of Singapore at the hands of the Japanese as part of the Second World War and its significance to the history of the world. As was suggested it signified the demise of the British Empire as it existed up until then.
It demonstrates that there is more to Singapore than what it is usually known for...I.e tourism and Changi Prison!
It is a guided tour of the British (British/Indian/ Australian)underground command post in the months leading up to the invasion of the Japanese. Our tour guide, Jerome, ( a qualified lawyer!) was incredible with his knowledge/commentary and passion for this era of world history.
Go experience it! It is in Fort Canning Park....a lovely respite from the hustle and bustle of this vibrant city!"
,,Very interesting,5.0,,Very interesting and informative tour. Excellent guide. Learnt from the guide that in the future you will be able to visit on your own. I really liked the guided tour and would definitely recommend it.
,,Battle Box revisited,5.0,,"I have previously visited the Battle Box prior to its recent refurbishment. The Battle Box is an historic building that represents a dark period when the World was involved in a major conflict.

Your visit to this bunker is now conducted with a tour guide. It is most important to have a guided tour to receive an historic commentary about the functioning of such a bunker, the working conditions inside, and the decisions being made under pressure with the spectre of defeat.

We were fortunate enough to follow this recount of history with a visit to Thailand and the 'Death Railway', where many of the prisoners of war were sent and died in miserable circumstances.

This was a most moving experience."
,,Informative tour,5.0,,"The tour of the Battlebox leads you through the underground bunker on Singapore's Fort Canning Park. Our guide was very competent in delivering the official information as well as answering our questions.
The tour uses various ways to convey the story of Britain's largest surrender, including several short films.
If you're interested in military history, this is a must-see."
,,IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT........,5.0,,"Battlebox had been closed for some time and I had missed the opportunity to visit on my last two trips to Singapore. Fortunately it has now re-opened.

I visited in May just prior to the official opening. I was in one of the first parties to visit our guide was the wonderful and extremely knowledgable Jerome.

The tour is one of the most informative tours you can do in Singapore. If your interest is World War II history or indeed how Singapore has become the place it is today - then I cannot recommend this tour enough.

The restoration has been done to an exacting standard and the tour is presented in a
totally non judgmental way......you form your own opinion.

Our tour although advertised to be 90 minutes actually took over two hours becasue
we were all so interested and asked so many questions of poor Jerome.

A really excellent and informative tour. If you are a history buff on the War I would suggest going to Changi and/or Kranji after this visit. If your interest is in the formation of Singapore I would suggest you follow this tour with the excellent tour offered by the
National Museum of Singapore.

A really enjoyable and interesting two hours."
,,Educational Place to visit!,4.0,,"The good:
- air-conditioned place
- A newly refurbished place
- Good source of history of Singapore
- Real WWII bunker

The not so good:
- Fort canning is an outdoor park, so be prepared for hot and humid weather (or even rain at times) condition. Do prepare insect repellent to repel mosquitoes.
- Walking on uneven surfaces may be involve
- Photography is not allowed"
,,Absolutely Fantastic,5.0,,"Found this by chance and what a brilliant and interesting find, this is a must for anyone interested in history and the 2nd WW. There are about 4 or 5 guided tours a day and the guides are so knowledgeable and interesting. The bunker has been restored excellently with a lot of attention paid to detail. The tour lasts for about 90mins to 2 hours depending on the size of the party and the amount of questions asked. Well worth the money for the visit."
,,"""A Story of Stratey & Surrender"" - Incredible History of Singapore and the Pacific War",5.0,,"We took the walking tour: ""A Story of Strategy & Surrender"" and had a terrific Battlebox experience. Our guide, Jerome, provided us with detailed narratives and interesting facts as we weaved through the underground bunker filled with photos, artifacts, short videos, and historical displays. It was a wonderful way to learn about the history of Singapore, specifically, what led to Lieutenant-General Percival's fateful decision to surrender. It also reminded us of the atrocities of war, the unnecessary loss of lives, sacrifices that were made by those who came before us. My teenager very much enjoyed the tour and felt that it was very well presented.

Since the Battlebox is nestled in the beautiful Fort Canning park, a natural respite from the hustle and bustle of Orchard area, it is well worth the detour. In fact, I recommend taking a few hours to explore the park and include the Battlebox in your itinterary."
,,Excellent educational tour of WW2 History,5.0,,The story of strategy and surrender of the fall of malaya and singapore is well presented and captured in the battlebox. The old bunker complex helps to get close and personal with history and the men who worked inside the underground bunker. The guided tour is well arranged and has a good flow of history presentation of the japanese occupation of singapore. The battlebox must be viewed first before visiting Changi War Museum. The story continues (sequel) with the POW camps in changi.
,,Go for the History lesson,4.0,,"This place gives you a good idea about the Japanese invasion of Malaysia up to the surrender of Singaore. The fort is nothing special but the guided tour bring the story to life and gives you a good idea about what happened with help of 3 films, maps, pictures an more. Worth visiting more for the history than the actual bunker."
,,Fantastic Tour,5.0,,"This is a must see, if you are visiting Singapore. Our guide, Jerome, was so knowledgeable about the history of Singapore. We were guided around the rooms of the Battlebox and shown film footage. It took about an hour or so, and was great value for money. Our family definitely learnt a lot."
,,The should be much higher on visitors To Do list in Singapore!,5.0,,"I stumbled across this whilst getting some quiet time in Canning Park away from the hubbub of central Singapore and I'm so glad I did. It was the highlight of my stay.

The Battle Box was the war time command centre for the British army, which has been carefully restored recently. You can book a guided tour that takes about 90 mins and been told the war time history of Singapore and Malaya in an easy to understand and very interesting format.

The guide was superb and I found the story fascinating. It completely enhanced my view of Singapore. Sure people visit the city to visit the zoo, Marina Bay, the Quays, Chinatown, Little India and the shops but none of this will help you understand it's important history.

I thoroughly recommend you fit the Battle Box into your itinerary. You will love it."
,,Moving insight into Singapore's history.,5.0,,"Our tour guide, Eisen, led us through an informative experience of the final days before the fall of Singapore in World War 2. The realistic displays, video presentations and explanations made the whole experience come alive. Our guide is an experienced historian and his knowledge of the era was impressive. A highly recommended activity."
,,Fascinating insight into the fall of Simgapore,5.0,,A very informative and well put together journey through the fall of Singapore through the eyes of the men who had to make the decision to surrender. Our guide Jerome was very entertaining and knowledgable and the exhibit itself allows you to walk through the various stages of the Japanese attack and eventual Allied capitulation. Well worth the time.
,,A marvellous tour,5.0,,"Jerome, our Battle Box guide, was brilliant. This tour was so interesting, Everyone should do it to gain an understanding of a big part of the history of World War Two."
,,Interesting tour,4.0,,"As part of Fort Canning Park this gives you an interesting view into the invasion of Singapore by the Japanese in 1942. The displays are well crafted and maintained. I'd also suggest visiting Fort Siloso on Sentosa for further information on WWII and indeed, Singapore history."
,,Very good,5.0,,"A very informative and interesting way to spend an hour in Singapore. Located almost at the top of Fort Canning, near the Fort Canning Hotel. The tunnels are airconditioned and spacious (not at all claustrophobic for me). The surrounding gardens are very peaceful."
,,Don't miss this!,5.0,,"Took a guided tour through the Battle box. The guide (Jerome) was excellent, very well informed and articulate. Anyone with an interest in history, or just with a curiosity around the circumstances around the greatest capitulation in British military history would find value in this tour. We attended with an 12 year and a 9 year old and they also enjoyed touring around this underground bunker and seeing the various remnants from WW2."
,,Fascinatingly,4.0,,"Well worth the time. The tour gave you the context as to what faced the British military leaders leading up to the surrender of some 120,000 allied troops, the largest capitulation in British military history. The surrender of Singapore was inevitable and may have saved thousands and thousands of civilian lives. A great 1.15 hour tour."
,,Informative and balanced,3.0,,"This is worth a visit for a family with young children. Battlebox gives a good account of what happened during WW2 from Singapore perspective. Not much of original stuff is left but the guide took us back in time with her effective nirratives and for a moment, we were compelled to think how one must have felt during those days.
Not sure why its not allowed to take photographs?"
,,Great historic information rich experience,5.0,,"We (me and two near adult sons) had a great time. Following previous reviews - yes it's very guided and it answers key questions about WW2 fall of Singapore. If you know these events in detail then you might not get much out of this and smaller children will get bored.

The guide was good (and yeah a little scripted) but knew her stuff.

It was like a real life very good 80 min documentary, that was well delivered."
,,A Highly Informative and Well Balanced Tour,5.0,,"I have been to many historical World War Two sites in the world and I can say that this one is well worth a visit. Firstly the Battle Box is in its original condition with only wax figures of those who took part, pictures and short informative films, to give perspective and feeling. Nothing has been added that is gaudy or out of keeping and therefore there is a real feel and atmosphere to the site.

Our guide was a lady called Anu, who give a very detailed and well balanced tour and took time for us to take in the Battle Box and to ask questions. You can tell she is well versed in the subject and shows a genuine interest.

The Battle Box has a small visitors centre with books etc on the subject and that is worth a browse if you want to explore the subject further."
,,Excelent tour,4.0,,"Most visitors are not surprisingly English or Australian. The tour is expansive and you will learn alot from it. Crazy times back in 1942.
The lady guide we had on the tour was very good, she obviously took her job seriously and was interested in the subject.
Well worth it!"
,,A awesome experience,5.0,,"My wife and I were very fortunate to be the only two on a tour so we had our own personal tour. Our guide Kel was excellent. She was very friendly, knowledgeable and quite easy to listen too. We had a wonderful time in learning all about this significant place in Singapore's history. Thank you Kel."
,,Excellent Tour,5.0,,"The Battle Box was an excellent Tour. The guide was informative and very interesting. We all enjoyed the tour, gave a really good insight into the dealings and decisions made. Highly recommended."
,,A perfect way to learn more about the fall of Singapore,5.0,,"I took the one hour tour. Jerome was very interesting and knowledgeable, particularly enjoyed the additional information he could give me ref the Malayan peninsular as a whole. Very lucky to be the only visitor and have the place to myself! Highly recommended."
,,Hidden Gem,5.0,,Wonderful and intriguing insight to a piece of history that had such a significant impact on the lives of so many people!
,,Recently reopened and well worth a visit,5.0,,"This attraction had only recently reopened after some changes but it did not disappoint. Our guide Haz was wonderful, she was extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the story she was sharing which made for a great 75 minute tour. You go down into the bunker and get a real feel for what went on during the war and fall of Singapore. There are static displays and also videos that really bring it all to life. This was the second visit for 2 in our party but the exhibit has changed in the last 6 years and we certainly enjoyed it as much as a first time visitor would. A must visit when in Singapore."
,,Informative and respectful,5.0,,A very informative overview of the battle for Singapore. A valuable insight into the problems encountered by the military and the local people.
,,Wonderful tour - My favorite tour in Singapore!,5.0,,"This tour is a must for anyone who loves history, learning about WWII, or learning about Singapore! This was my first trip to Singapore, my husband was there for work, and I stumbled upon this delightful tour while he was in meetings. The renovated set up is fantastic, really gives you a feel of how it would have been during that time. The guide was very knowledgeable and did an excellent job! I cannot say enough positive things about it. It is one of my favorite things I did on my trip, I highly recommend it to anyone."
,,Fantastic museum -- highly recommended,5.0,,"I love World War II history, but my wife is much more of a neophyte, so I think it says something that we both loved our 70 minute tour of the Battlebox museum. The combination of static displays, videos, and information from the tour guide combined for a fascinating experience that really brought back the Fall of Singapore to life, if you'll pardon the cliche. Our tour guide, Joanne, was not only extremely knowledgeable but also very passionate about what happened, which made the experience that much more meaningful.

So if you are at all interested in what happened in Singapore during WWII or just like the idea of learning a great story, check out the Battlebox. It was well worth our money and time!"
,,A wonderful guiding tour dipping into the history of Singapore,5.0,,"I feel glad that I could have the chance to join the guiding tour into the battlebox. I felt like wondering into the flow of time, going back to the past. This was my first trip to Singapore, I am happy that I could not only enjoy the modern part of it but also the historical part when going through the tour. The tour guide, Shawn, was very warmhearted and humorous, and explained the history to my friend and I clearly. Please tell him we are appreciated. Battlebox is surely a spot I will visit again and recommend."
,,History experienced,4.0,,"Having been to the old Battlebox a few times b before renovation I was eager to see what the re-launched place would be like.
We had a very helpful guide (Mrs Joanne) to take us around and explaining about that historic event of the fall of Singapore.
Overall, I found that the new concept actually provides a deeper way to learn about the history of that place then the previous concept. Battlebox is definitely worthwhile a visit."
,,Battle of Visit,5.0,,"Nancy, our guide, was really knowledgeable and made our visit very interesting. The exhibits were realistic and added to the experience. This was one of the highlights of our visit to Singapore and I would really recommend anyone to make the time to visit."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"museum had just opened that week, so a few minor glitches, but staff were great and the place is very interesting. Gave a good idea what was happening in Singapore during those fateful days. definitely a highlight"
,,fulifilling and great,5.0,,"the staffs were all very friendly and outgoing, in addition they managed to fill us in about the details about pre war and post war! Especially the troop's actions!!! It was really a very great experience, and its worth the money!!!! After this trip, i learnt so much more about World war2!"
,,A lovely surprise,5.0,,"I only went here because my son is a history buff and wanted to visit. The walk up to Fort Canning Park from the streets is gorgeous (steep though, lots of steps), The Battlebox tour went for about 1 hour 15 minutes and was really interesting. Jerome was our guide and was really knowledgable and fun. This was a really nice surprise and I would recommend if you are interested in the history of Singapore/War."
,,Interesting Museum in a Bunker,5.0,,We had a wonderful young lady as a guide who was well versed in the history of the place and gave a professional tour of the facility. The museum is located in the original underground rooms of the command centre in Fort Canning. The tour takes you through the various rooms explaining in a time line how events unfolded up to and following the surrender of Singapore in Feb 1942. A number of rooms have video presentations of original newsreel footage setting the scene and then you visit one of the rooms set out as it was at a specific time leading up to the surrender. Overall a fascinating museum with quality displays and excellent guide.
,,Excellent historical site in city centre,5.0,,"I've been coming to Singapore on business for 25 years but, until now, had no idea that this amazing and well preserved piece of WW2 history sits virtually in the heart of the city and can be toured daily.

The Battle Box tour shows the history of the last days of the Allied army control of Singapore and talks candidly but calmly about the tactical mistakes and, perhaps inevitability of the defeat.

The Battle Box itself is a huge underground bunker. If you want to be cool for a while but out of the endless shopping centres of Orchard Road, this is a great place to come. After going down a couple of flights of stairs it is all on one level, well lit and relatively spacious so claustrophobics shouldn't have a problem.

The guide was well spoken and knowledgable.

This is a must see for anyone with an interest in the military history of Singapore.

Flat shoes are best. There are multiple tours a day that last about 1.5 hours. Check your times so you are not sitting waiting too long. The visitor centre is quite small with little seating.

The surrounding Fort Canning park is beautiful to wander around but quite hilly and not for the frail. Wear comfy shoes and Take your water if you want to explore it."
,,A Must-Visit for WWII Historians,4.0,,"As a WWII buff, I enjoyed my visit to Fort Canning Hill, one of Singapore's most important historic sites. Occupied by the British during the early days of WWII, Fort Canning Hill came under Japanese occupation after the British surrendered Singapore in 1942. Expect to spend half a day at this historic site. You don't need a guide to visit this place. WWII historians will enjoy the museum with its well-documented story of the Surrender of Singapore."
,,Battlebox,4.0,,"The Battlebox is in the Fort Canning area, not far from Dhoby Ghaut or Bras Basah metro stops. The tour lasts an hour. We were fortunate to have a guide, Jerome, as he was so incredibly knowledgeable about the war history of Singapore. The Battlebox is a large bunker, now with memorabilia, telling the story of why the British surrendered Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. We were unable to take photos because a new company has taken over the tours and the official launch is in a few weeks time. The visit is highly recommended for anyone interested in WWII history and the Allies role. The conflict was also in the bunker, not just between the warring countries."
,,Great little find,5.0,,"Stumbled across the Battlebox by accident, just in time for a tour. We thought it would be interesting to learn about a part of British WW2 history that we had no prior knowledge of and the promise of air conditioning was a welcome bonus. Our guide was very knowledgable & engaging. Not a high tech museum but anyone with a passing interest in history should enjoy it."
,,Not for Me,5.0,,"This is a good thing to see if you're into the war history and all that stuff. And even better if you're from the UK. My dad wanted to see this so we went. I wouldn't be interested in pay the money to see this but he enjoyed it. I thought it was boring and just wanted it to end. But you'll see the bunker/underground fort and hear stories of what happened. My dad was happy and so were all the old men who took this tour. I could really tell they liked war history. So while it's not for me, I'm still giving it a good review."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"I am not a fan of history and get bored very easily

The tour is 1hr 15 and it kept my attention the whole time

It was fascinating and Anu our guide delivered the tour perfectly

It's nice and cool down there

I hope the tour goes from strength to strength

We didn't have time to see changi prison which is a shame as we left this to the last day

Battle box needs to be seen before changi prison to get the story in the right order"
,,Fascinating and informative tour of Singapore surrender,5.0,,The tour of the battle box was very interesting. I did not know the history of the surrender of Singapore to Japan. The guide was excellent in her storytelling and the reconstruction of the command centre was very lifelike. You are not allowed to take photos or video tape. Great place for all ages and I am a female and loved it. Have fun
,,"Interesting place, terrible guided tour",2.0,,"I'm always suspicious of places that force you into a guided tour - it limits your experience, drives up the price, and the guide has to pitch to the lowest common denominator, so you get less info than you could get from signs and brochures.

Battle box suffers from all of these problems - there are only a few tours a day (not much demand though and it seems like you can show up a minute before the tour and get a ticket), it costs $18, the guide was slow and uninformed, the tour took twice as long as it needs to (some of the kids were just running around the place because they were so bored), and the displays are very limited, so it's more like a droning 1.5 hour stand-up lecture (with THREE films during the tour, only two of which you get to sit down for).

If they fixed the exhibits and allowed general entry, they might be able to create something as good as Churchill's War Rooms in London and really allow the history of the battle to be told properly."
,,Fall of Singapore brought to life,5.0,,If you have any interest in military history you will enjoy this. I had a general knowledge of the fall of Singapore in WWII but this tour helped to fill in gaps and correct misapprehensions thanks to the guide who really knew her stuff. Walking round the various rooms of the underground command bunker with their life size soldiers in the act of performing their duties was very immersive. The video clips and photos added to the atmosphere. The tour takes about an hour.
,,Fascinating perspective on the war in the region,5.0,,"Being brought up in Europe, my understanding of the theatre of war in Asia turns out to have been shockingly weak.
I knew about the POW transfers out to places like Thailand, but nothing of the civilian story post Japanese invasion of Singapore.
Very moving and the story is well told as you move around the various rooms that consist what was the operational bunker."
,,A Real Piece of Wartime History,5.0,,Took the Battlebox tour last weekend and found it excellent. The tour guide had a great knowledge of the wartime events and the displays in the various rooms gave a real feeling of the events that occurred all those years ago. Highly recommended.
,,Must do while in Singapore,5.0,,"Very impressed. Learnt a bit about the pacific war i did not know about. Our guide Jerome, was extremely knowledgable and friendly. Well worth doing!"
,,Moving,5.0,,"It's always interesting to hear about war from other nations and this was no different. This gives such a moving account of the war in Singapore and Malaysia. From an Australian point of view, I learnt more about our involvement in the war in the Asia Pacific region, something not much talked about when I was ar school. By the end of the tour, there was not a dry eye. This officially opens in June and they are continuing to improve the tour and the experience but it's already impressive."
,,Open at last!!,5.0,,Have been visiting Singapore for a few years seeing relatives but this has been closed. Just reopened and discovered this by chance. Singapore is a modern bustling place and history is sometimes subsumed by this. The changes since WW2 are dramatic to say the least and being able to step back 75 years and relive the events in the exact spot was fascinating. The whole story from the 1930s until 1945 was placed in context and the characters brought to life by waxworks and the brilliant commentary from our guide /doscent Eisen Teo. The place (unlike most of Singapore) has been left untouched and together with Fort Canning Park is a peaceful haven from the hustle and bustle of the city. Thoroughly enjoyed it and thoroughly recommend it for anyone with even a passing interest in history.
,,Eye opening,5.0,,"I only visited Battlebox on the suggestion of my brother who knows more about military history than myself. What a truly eye opening experience this place is, totally value for money as you cannot simply roam around the site but must go on a guided tour.
I learned so much from the tour, stuff every generation should know.
Would highly recommend a visit if you ever stay in Singapore."
,,Great use of video,5.0,,If you have previously been disappointed by turning up and finding the site closed the good news is there is new company running the show with a dedicated ticket office. Tours are guided. Eisen Teo who took me round was fantastically knowledgeable and he uses video to put the whole Battle of Singapore in context. If you are interested in WWII this is the must see in Singapore. As others have said Dhoby Ghaut is the MRT stop although you have to cross multiple roads to get to the Battlebox. This was one of the best military tours I have done and I have done a lot.
,,Essential to Understand WWII History,5.0,,Touring the Battlebox transports you back to the desperate days of 1941/42 when the Japanese invaded the Malay peninsula and Singapore. Guides do a great job of explaining the design and use of the bunker. They also give (and present in films) a very informative presentation over the battle of Singapore.
,,Worth doing,5.0,,"The battle box, an underground facility used by the British during WW2 has been upgraded and is visited as part of a guided tour. Well worth doing! Can be accessed from Dohby Ghaut MRT. A short walk up the hill to Fort Canning. Singapore has a history and this is one location you can get an insight to it. Our guide, Shaun was knowledgeable and informative and answer all our questions Unfortunately no photos are allowed inside the Battle Box. Combine this with a walk around Fort Canning for an interesting couple of hours"
,,Secret battle headquarters,4.0,,"A fascinating tour of the Allies underground bunker in Fort Canning Park, Singapore. A critical control headquarters during the fall of Singapore to Japan in WW2. Realistic displays convey the stress that the military leaders faced in making the critical decision to surrender. An excellent commentary by a very knowledgeable and personable guide, Anu."
,,Battlebox Tour,5.0,,A great paced and informative tour. Added bonus is tour is underground and air conditioned. Would highly recommend it. Not to be missed.
,,At long last...,5.0,,"For 10 years I have been trying to gain access to the Battlebox & after many promises from different people & organisations, it has never happened. Until now! Congratulations to the tour company for opening up the Battlebox to visitors. Finally I have been inside! It was worth the wait, very much enjoyed the tour & it is amazing the Battlebox is in excellent condition...
Would be good to add some history of the Battlebox from after the war & why it's taken so long to become a tourist attraction... the best kept secret in Singapore."
,,Battlebox History Tour Singapore,5.0,,Highly informative and fascinating look at the events leading to the British surrender to the Japanese in WW2.
,,Home school NE fieldtrip,4.0,,The guide was very informative and helpful. The battle box has been refurbished in a very comfortable amber for visit while learning about the history.
,,Battlebox,5.0,,"Very interesting, & well well worth a visit. So much to see and guide very knowledgeable. Would recommend it to all"
,,Battle box well worth the effort,5.0,,Excellent tour with admission to the bunker and all the rooms many as they were at the end of the war.
,,Fascinating Museum,5.0,,"The recently reopened Battle Box Museum has been exceptionally well designed to provide a fascinating and moving account of a particular chapter of WW2. We visited a week ago and were lucky enough to have an excellent guide in Kel, who gave enough information and anecdotes to make the tour interesting and moving, yet didn't get bogged down with too much detail. There were a number of short videos plus photos in addition to the tour of the underground rooms. This was one of the most thoughtfully planned tours we've done and is highly recommended as one of the top places to visit in Singapore."
,,accidental discovery - tour worth it!,5.0,,"We had arrived in Singapore late the previous night and hadn't booked anything for this first morning to help with adjusting to Singapore Time. Since our hotel was close to Fort Canning Park we wandered through the grounds and to the top for the view. We noticed a few signs along the way about the battle box, not having heard of it before didn't dwell on it. We entered the air conditioned information centre and were asked if we were there for the tour, with a few details explained we had signed up for this new tour and were eager to start. What a tour. Great tour guide, full of information and patience. This is a history lesson professionally delivered. tour is underground, and significantly cooler. the tour lasted an hour, but didn't feel like it... well put together, some original pieces still in place. a set of stairs, up to 12, at the beginning."
,,Battlebox Tour - Singapore,5.0,,"We did not know about this tour, but happened to arrive at the Information Centre at Fort Canning Park just after the tour had started, in its second week. We are history buffs so jumped at the opportunity for a tour of the WWII operation strong hold. The tour guide was very informative and the under-ground battle-rooms where all the WWII operations took place was fascinating, complemented with original footage of war events. We walked in through unassuming metal doors on the hillside, down steps into the numerous operation rooms where 500 people had worked at the height of WWII. How the underground stronghold was ventilated was interesting as was the demonstration of the strategic operations on the original battle-plan board. The tour was not expensive and ran a little overtime, so we thought it was well worth it."
,,Really interesting tour,5.0,,"Visits to the Battlebox are via guided tour that lasted a little under an hour and a half. Really interesting place to visit and the information provided by our knowledgeable guide was pitched about right to cover people who do have a good understanding of the history and those who don't. I thought the wax figures were going to be a bit cheesy, but actually they do add to the interpretation of the history, and with the furniture and authentic (or authentic looking at any rate) props giving the place a real feeling of the important moments in history that happened there.
Our guide Kamalia was clearly very knowledgeable and was very friendly and helpful with answering questions. She was also great with the kids on the tour.
I'd very much recommend a visit to the Battlebox, we're really glad we went and thought it also was good value."
,,Very Informative & Interesting,5.0,,Our guide Paul was fantastic. He was very into & kept us all interested & entertained. He didn't drone on & just kept talking about the important stuff & would make sure we had the details we needed so we had the full picture without being talked at. The site was amazing & it is just heartbreaking to learn about what these poor people went through.
,,20year ago visit vs 2016 visit (23/3/2016),3.0,,"I and my partner visited this site because last time we don't have chance enter the underground battle box due to cease of operation. My last visit was 20yrs ago with my school friend.
We took 14:45hrs tour and tour guide is Ms kal. She tries her best to present the battle box.
DO note that you cant have your free time to walk around after the tour. Visit the wash rm before the tour commence because no wash rm iniside the battlebox

Current:
- More video clip is available.
- More room are open to member of public.
- Some pictures on the wall . (pls remove those screw so that avoid further damage on the wall).
- More cooling compare 20yrs ago

Different:
- Tour guide was wear those kaki uniform.
- Last time the souvenir shop was inside the battle box.

suggestion /improvement :
- Create sound effect in the planning rm /sighted plane rm . example : voice of communication and siren sound. Type writer sound in the room. Ppl walking hurry along the corridor.
- create of unqiue souvenir. Buy a yellow metal dring cup with a engrave of battle box logo on it. I have one of such item which got it during opening of Johor battery around earlier year 2000.
- place seat at tourist visiting centre. it seems not enough seat and we have to stand around.
- change the voice of narrator in the video clip. Perhaps get hoarse and deep sound to present it. At least sound like a military officer present video.
- Put a dummy soldier near the entrance with a stop sign. At least tourist can feel the start of the tour.(last time got this display soldier)

** There is a special secret place that was not open to member of public for 20yrs** Is a MUST to SEE.
** A bit disappointed because public relationship in FB need to improve. I was expected the intruders detail information should be available. it seems ....."
,,Singapore History,4.0,,"I visited Battlebox about two or three weeks after the facility had opened. The staff were keen to please, very pleasant and helpful. The tour leader was a young lady who had a good presentational style and coped with technical teething problems. The story was presented sympathetically to the Allied Command and to the local people of Singapore and Malaya (and wider SE Asia) who were to suffer as much from the Allied defeat as did the Allies. I was most fascinated by the presentation and film clips shown."
,,Interesting and informative tour,5.0,,We did the 0945 1 hour tour and had the tour guide to ourselves. Was reasonably priced and well worth the time. This was a critical location during WWII and the tour provides heaps of great info into what happened and what the fort was used for. The battle box is having work done and due to be complete in June 16 but it was still a great hour in its current state. Would definitely take people to this again if I'm in town
,,A superb history lesson.,5.0,,"To think that the Battle Box has survived basically unmolested for all this time is brilliant. Our History and sites are often lost to so called improvement. This place is so authentic and so well presented, it is indeed worthy of all praise. Lets hope it stays as it is, just maintenance to stop it crumbling away."
,,visit march 2016,5.0,,"Excellent guided tour, guides knowledge in depth and helped to better understand the factors that led to surrender. A bit cooler underground out of the heat of the day too. Waxworks about the place made it quite evocative of such a desperate time, particularly as there were only a few of us walking around in a group."
,,A fantastic tour!,4.0,,A wonderful informative tour of the Battle Box! We learned so much of this fascinating place and the key decisions made there during the Japanese invasion.
,,Battle Box singapore,5.0,,well worth a visit my wife and I found this very informative as it was in it infancy i feel it will be even better the next time we visit.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"The bunker was amazing, but what made it better was our tour guide I can't remember his name but he was the tall Asian boy. He made the tour what it is by being really knowledgable about WW2. I had no idea about Singapores involvement in the war until I went on this tour. It's a must see attraction I would go again ."
,,Battle Box Tour,5.0,,"Fantastic 1-1/2 hour tour of the Battle Box in Fort Canning Park. Tour guide was exceptional and very informative. The underground tunnels/bunkers were very interesting. If you love history, you'll love this park. The hill once sited the palaces of 14th century Malay Kings and served as the Headquarters of the Command Centre and British Army Barracks. The decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942 was also made on the hill, in the Battle Box."
,,A window into history,4.0,,"This tour was recommended to us and I am glad it was. What an excellent outing.
The cost was S$18 for adults and ~1/2 that for children.
What followed was more than 1 hour of highly informative telling of the Fall of Singapore and the surrounding events.
We had one slight hiccup during the first audio visual presentation when the projector failed but our guide (Shaun) did a marvelous job covering for it and it did not detract from the tour in anyway.
The dioramas and displays added immeasurably to the tour. The tidbits of information provided whilst explaining events also added value to the human dimension of the story of General Percival vs. General Yamashita.
I don't want to steal the thunder of the guides so I will not dwell further on the story but suffice it to say that it was well worth the price of admission and I wouldn't hesitate to go back again."
,,Very nice Tour with excellent Guide,5.0,,The tour was around 1.5 hours! It start at visitors center and end there as well. The bunker is interesting to see. The Guide mention lots of background information during the tour! Also some videos about the history of Singapore where shown!
,,Great experience,5.0,,This is a fantastic way to take in history. We can to easily forget what happened only a couple of generations ago. Get the history while taking a tour of the battle box. A must do in Singapore.
,,The End of Empire - the myths debunked,5.0,,"I did this tour before the recent changes and wanted to compare and contrast. I also had with me a teenager who is studying history (WW2) at school. I have to say that the tour and the guide were most impressive. There is a lot more audio visual material than before and a lot of historical fact but not so much as to bewilder or confuse. The group was small - only 4 of us - but that helped with the personal approach of the young guide. All of the questions from the group were answered smartly and the little quiz at the end was a good way for the guides to see if they had got their message across. It is still a work in progress but it is well worth visit and the agonising and exhausting climb up the steps from Dhoby Ghaut MRT in the 30 plus temperatures. To avoid this, approach from the east along Coleman Street and veer left on to the more gently sloping road which runs behind the National Museum."
,,Great tour on a hot day!!,4.0,,"This is my second tour of this tour (last one 7yrs ago). The addition of audiovisual presentations have enhanced this tour. One negative is that the wax cast figures of key military officers do not move or speak anymore...it used to be awesome. The battle box has been cleaned up, still a great tour and value for money!"
,,Great tour of the battle box,5.0,,"Great tour guide she had a good understanding of the war and the fort. well worth the visit . our son loved the under ground tour. The tour lasted an hour but it seemed like we were underground for about 20 minutes, as the guide was entertaining and involved everyone in the tour. All the people on the tour spoke highly of the guide's personable manner."
,,Glad to for the experience,4.0,,"I have been fortunate to visit many WWII sites in Asia and Europe and am well versed in the war and battle history. The tour of the Battlebox was wonderful to add to my experience, although I thought a bit more of Fort Siloso (with it's broader focus, this is perhaps not a fair comparison) and of the Berlin Bunker Tour of a civilian shelter.

The guide was fine, but I felt the information was more geared to middle school aged children and we were a group of all adults. More specific information on the conditions of Singapore at the time of the surrender, the after effects, etc would have been interesting. Other museums in Singapore do have information and interviews from WWII survivors, it would be nice if some of this was available here. Personal memories of the fall would be quite moving in this setting.

I had been very much looking forward to this tour and viewing. I am glad to have seen the Battlebox, but to be honest, although interesting to see, the tour and the overall experience was a bit disappointing."
,,A tragedy about to unfold,4.0,,"After 2 previous trips to Singapore it was great anticipation that I found the Battlebox finally open in Fort Canning Park . Although the tours are in the teething stages prior to the official opening it was done hand in hand with enthusiasm and great respect. The group was not too large and of course included those who ask ridiculous questions such as 'Who won the war ?"" ..that must come with the territory and was well dispatched by the tour guide. I look forward to returning once the tours are in full swing and can appreciate further this historical site."
,,A reminder of the past,4.0,,"The Battlebox was not officially open when we had the visit and we were lucky enough to catch a guided tour prior to its opening. It is underground, which made it even more atmospheric and appreciative of the the difficulties encountered by the soldiers. The guide was very good and showed his understanding and knowledge of the time. As this piece of Singapore history is within living memory, there are still those who lived through the times or their children visiting this area, respect should be shown. Unfortunately, some people on the tour did not and this was rather disappointing. However, the tour was excellent and gave a little insight into the terrible conditions endured by the people of Singapore and those stationed there. Walking back into modern Singapore through the park is like a little bit of time travel. Well worth a visit and listen carefully."
,,We will remember them,4.0,,"Stumbled across the Battlebox visitor information centre while hiking around Fort Canning. Lovely little gift shop with nice locally designed products that make for great gift/souvenirs.

The guided tours last just over an hour, with the first tour starting at 9:45am. Adult ticket price of $18. The entire duration of the tour is in the underground bunker, so take note if you are not comfortable with confined spaces. Also, there is no cell phone reception in the bunker, which is quite fitting so you do appreciate when the guides describe the difficulties created by the poor communications between the bunker and the outside world during the war.

There are many interesting posters on the walls, but limited time to read all the posters while keeping up with the tour. Interesting to take note of the times on the clocks in the various rooms which are set to the times of the significant event that is being portrayed in the room. That the lives of so many soldiers and civilians were so irreparably changed by the decision of the few men in a bunker is a sobering thought.

Would have been interesting to have more information on how the bunker was built, or how the bunker received its supplies of water, fuel, etc... The tour only visits a few of the rooms in the bunker, maybe more rooms will be included when the tour officially opens in June 2016.

If interested to trace the steps following the decision to surrender, you can also visit The Ford Factory at Bukit Timah (site of the surrender)."
,,Back in time,4.0,,Here we go back in history. Premises are well maintained and guided tour is available - duration about 1 hour. For selected rooms only since they are currently still in the process of patching it up.
,,Simply Amazing!,5.0,,"We visited the Battlebox in January 2015, but closed for refurbishment. Visited Singapore again in March 2016 and we fortunate enough to take part in a guided tour prior to the official re-opening on 28 March 2016.

What a truly amazing experience. The guide was just fantastic. She was extremely enthusiastic and just so knowledgeable. She told the story with such conviction.

I would definitely recommend this attraction as a must see while in Singapore!"
,,Significant place in Singapore's history.,5.0,,Very moving experience. An integral place in Singapore's history. Guide very informative. A must do for anyone interested in history.
,,Retracing the steps of Singapore's colonial forefathers with the help of accomplished guides at The Battlebox!,5.0,,"A wonderful opportunity to retrace the steps of Singapore's colonial forefathers, and understand the difficult situations presented by a formidable opposing force that spurs these military leaders to make that very difficult decision of giving up the fight and raise the white flag.

The accomplished guides will give visitors a very vivid account of many on-goings within the confines of this military work space which was held in high confidence in peace times as well as in war.

Marvel at how the Battlebox was so brilliantly constructed with lots of architectural features well thought out to ensure that its inhabitants would have a conducive environment to function in.

An extremely enriching experience of history's most momentous milestones in just under one hour. One that will never fails to excite and inspire!"
,,Very moving,5.0,,The Battlebox was a very interesting and moving experience which I found especially poignant. The underground bunker would have been very hot and stuffy with so many men all crowded into the bunker. The commentary was very interesting and well presented and our guide was very animated and visibly affected by the fall of Singapore as she told us her mother and father were in Singapore at the time. Well worth the visit to see another side of Singapore from the usual tourist attractions. The Battlebox is in a very beautiful park with lovely gardens and trees. It is a very steep walk up to the top of the hill but well worth it.
,,Professional guide tour with well WW2 knowledge,5.0,,"This new attraction is 18SGD nett for about an hour tour, I think it's pricy at the beginning but after the tour I think it's totally worth it.
The Battlebox was very well maintain and renovated nicely with full air condition and the tour guide is very professional with years of training.
They made many wax men to simulate the time while the war officer in the Battlebox and also made up few videos for you to understand more during the world war 2 how the soldiers attack Singapura and Malaya.
Please take note that no photography allowed in the Battlebox"
,,Informative and very interesting,5.0,,"Did The Battlebox tour on a recent trip to Singapore. We had done this several years ago but it has been closed for the last couple of years. It has now re-opened and the tours are now running again under different management. Gabriel (our tour guide) was very informative and his knowledge is second to none. The tour is different to how it was previously done and even if you have done this tour before, it is worth doing it again. The tour is now much more informative and we learnt more this time than we did last. Highly recommend doing this tour."
,,The hidden mystery of Singapore,5.0,,"We were lucky to go on a preview tour of the Battlebox on our last day in Singapore. Very pleased we did. Our tour guide, Nancy, was very well informed and passionate about the history of the events leading up to the surrender on 15 February 1942. We hope that the opening in June hoes well at lots of people will benefit from the work you have been doing thus far."
,,Wonderful and informative.,5.0,,We had been here years ago before it was closed. It's been undergoing upgrading for 5 years. Still a work in progress it's due to be completed finished in June. What I really enjoyed was the fact we had real person --- Nancy leading us around. She gave us a very interesting tour . I really found it full of facts. A sad tale of Singapore history. If you are interested in local and world history you will enjoy this place.
,,Really good tour,5.0,,"Happened to get in this tour as I needed a break from the heat and underground tunnels sounded ideal! I love history and the guide/researcher (Eisen) was very knowledgeable and seemed to love what he was doing. He made the tour engaging and friendly and gave an in depth and fair story of the Japanese invasion of Singapore.
The building itself was interesting and left largely untouched from what was originally left by the British.
Great tour!"
,,well worth seeing if you are interested in War history,5.0,,"Visited Fort Canning Park and came upon this museum by accident
Recently re opened I was given a guided tour by a very knowledgeable guide Graham
This is where the terms of the surrender of Singapore were formulated by the Allies and then delivered to the Japanese in the Ford works down the road
The war rooms have been reconstructed with models and equipment of the time including some rare original pieces
A must for history buffs"
,,"Guns, Graves, and Battles tour",5.0,,"I waited three years to tour the battlebox because it's been closed for renovation. It was worth the wait.

I took the longer of the two tours offered, the ""Guns, Graves, and Battles"" tour, which covers both the Battlebox and Fort Canning. It ran a little over 2.5 hours and was time well spent. My guide, Shar, was knowledgeable and kept us fully engaged, asking us questions. We didn't just listen to him tell us about what we were seeing, we also were asked what we thought about things, why we thought things happened, etc. He was also able to answer questions about history in Singapore and Malaysia and how it was all related to what we were seeing, which I considered really helpful in understanding the bigger picture. I got so much more out of this tour than many I've been on.

Highly recommend this tour. Take water with you, though, as the fort is warm and humid, and you see that before you tour the much cooler Battlebox."
,,Battlebox experience,4.0,,"Before the official opening in June 2016, preview guided tours are available and well worth the effort in climbing Fort Canning Hill, although a taxi will drop you right outside the entrance. We were taken into the underground control & command centre where many of the rooms have been set up to look as they were during WW 2 with mannequins of Madame Tussaud standard. Historical information was expertly given, supplemented by short interesting footage from the period. Highly recommended."
,,Facinating History Experience,5.0,,"There is nothing more interesting than a look back into history. The mystique associated with this incredible reconstruction of War Times real situations is remarkable. It is quite eerie to imagine what it would have been like and the reconstruction and amazing life like dummies displayed, make it come to life. Depictions of the events that took place in this somewhat fateful place are to behold. A constructive comment would be perhaps, extend the tour time 10 minutes and allow reasonable time to fully view and read the many authentic photographs that adorn the walls. Our guide was fully knowledgeable, clear to understand and done a great job.
Reasonably priced and not to be missed. Check first, as there are selected tour times, personal entry is not permitted."
,,Awesome tour,5.0,,"The Battlebox tour exceeded expectation. It is educational, emotional and informative. The historical dialogue, videos and presentation of the wax figures in their original positions transported us back to the reality of the fall of Singapore. This is the best tour of its type we have experienced."
,,Great place to experience the surrender of singapore,5.0,,An excellent all round visit well worth the $18. Tour guide really new her stuff and wasn't stumped by any of the questions. I would have liked to take some photos though.
,,The Battle Box Guided walking tour,4.0,,"The Battle Box guided walking tour was very interesting and the tour guide was very helpful and most informative. Gave great insights into the invasion of Singapore during WW2 by the Japanese and also the contributions made by India, UK and Australia. They also acknowledge and wish to remember those that served and fought to try and hold off the Japanese invasion. Recommend this tour."
,,Calling history lovers!,4.0,,An interesting afternoon can be spent at the Battlebox located under Fort Canning Park. In the last weeks of World War 2 the Defence of Singapore was masterminded in this very bunker which has just been reopened to the public. The tour ( which runs 4 times a day) is a bit pricy at $18 but for slightly more than an hour you step back in time and get immersed into the tense atmosphere as British commanders unsuccessfully tried to defend Singapore and finally decided to surrender unconditionally. The guide was able to maintain interest and brought us through the dimly lit rooms explaining what each was used for and how it would have been 70 years ago... What it might have felt like and even smelt like. The reasons behind the surrender were well explained and I found it fascinating. Apart from the tour there is just a small shop on site with toilets and a cafe a few steps further into the park.
,,The commanders' bunker where the English surrendered to the Japanese in 1942,5.0,,"An underground bunker, with 27 rooms. A guide took us around as it was not yet opened to the public when we visited in early March 2016. There are wax representations of the commanders in various rooms, a switchboard, a cypher room, an air filtration plant, etc. and photos and films of the surrender. Our guide was a young history consultant who was conducting research on the period. He was very knowledgeable. The guided visit took more than an hour."
