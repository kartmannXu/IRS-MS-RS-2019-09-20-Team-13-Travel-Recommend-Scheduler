,,Not My Seen,3.0,,Ok don’t no what the hype is about this fountain. Located out side tower 3 suntec city. You can view from top or find your way down stairs and walk around water. Not my seen.
,,A Sight to bee seen at Night,5.0,,This isn't a must do thing but if your in the area or visiting Suntec City you can stick around for the lights to come on. During the day it doesn't look very special but at night when the lights come on it does look very pretty. In Singapore this is the symbol for the wealth that flowes through the city state a lot people throw coins in the fountain hoping it will bring them some of that wealth. I recommend getting a pizza at ALT pizza at night and enjoying the beautiful Display of lights at the Fountain my kids enjoyed it a lot.
,,World’s Largest Fountain,3.0,,"Draws on the Hindu Mandala which means universe. It represents the blending of the many races, religions and cultures that make up the population of Singapore, and the harmony in which they live."
,,Something different in a shopping complex,4.0,,"The Fountain of Wealth is situated in Suntec City so if you are in the area, it is worth a visit. There are a lot of little water spouts coming up from the ground and you walk up a path to the actual fountain, walk around it 3 times with your hand in the water and wish.
Something different to do in Singapore."
,,Biggest fountain?,3.0,,Claims to be the biggest fountain but sure there was a larger one in Dubai! It’s a nice attraction & something you can’t help but pass when doing the city bus trip but not sure I’d go out of my way to visit it!
,,Best at night - lots of color,4.0,,"Pics from 31st floor in Conrad Centennial Hotel. Mesmerizing at night to appreciate the grandeur fountain.
Open to go inside the fountain during the day; check the times.
Can also eat at ground level view from Suntec City in their food court and restaurants surrounding the fountain!
Neat experience"
,,strange,3.0,,Left wondering why this is biggest fountain in the world – nothing to see and nothing to experience – quite a strange place and reviews… But on the way to marina bay you can stop for 1 minute…
,,Nice to look at.,4.0,,Nice to look at. Nothing to go out of your way to find. if you are in the area ok. I didn't even know it was the worlds biggest fountain until i read it here...
,,Air flow is so gooood,5.0,,It's located at the B or G floor infront of supermarket. Touch water and pray. The Laser show should be check and yu can upstair to sky garden (maybe 3rd floor of Suntec city build.1) so windy and good to stay here for a while. They provide Live chat when you lost your way
,,Crown on the Street,4.0,,"Fountain of Wealth •
Beautiful as ive seen it the first time
its like a Crown in the middle of Concrete jungle city of Singapore
declared as largest Fountain in the World year 1998 and still looking magnificent especially when water is cascading from the top and illuminated by lights.
Diners has a good glimpse of view from Suntec basement where foundation of structure stand."
,,SPECTACULAR FOUNTAIN,4.0,,"The Fountain of Wealth is at the centre of the Suntec Complex. It is an amazing design and since it`s completion, has aroused all sorts of ""superstitions"" and stories about generating personal wealth ! It is beautifully lit at night. Some research before you travel will enhance your visit."
,,Beautiful and one of largest man made fountain,5.0,,"Location: Awesome Perfect: For evening Surrounding: Shopping area excellent, meeting area and also City tour buses run from nearby. Lighting: Awesome especially around 6 pm. Cover: 4 building around it."
,,Day time visit,4.0,,"Went during the day and it’s no doubt more amazing at night with the light show, but enjoyed the visit and hoping the wealth comes our way!"
,,A bit disappointing,3.0,,You can only get a reasonable view from inside the mall. You can’t actually get to it from outside. I would not go out of my way to see it.
,,Probably best seen at night,4.0,,"We walked past the fountain and we viewed it from the top deck of the sightseeing bus on many occasions. It is an impressive fountain, standing 13.8m high with the circular ring supported on four columns. Its location is regarded as the Hub of Suntec City and represents the palm of the left hand with the surrounding tower blocks representing the thumb and four fingers. We did not get to see the laser displays at night, whenever we passed there were the inward flows from the ring, no large jet. Shame we did not see it in full flow with the lasers so that we could draw a comparison with the fountains in both Barcelona and Lima"
,,Big and colourful,5.0,,"I am staying at Conrad Centennial Hotel and my room overlooks the fountain of wealth. It is the largest fountain in the world according to the Guinness Book of records. It symbolises wealth and life.
I watch groups of people walking around the inner fountain when the main fountain is turned off. Apparently anyone who circles the fountain three times while touching the water will receive good luck and blessings. The bronze ring of the fountain is designed based on the Hindu Mandala, meaning universe and is a symbolic representation of the oneness in spirit and unity and further symbolises the equality and harmony of all races and religions in Singapore."
,,Enjoy the afternoon break,5.0,,"I liked to be there walking through the fountain. The energy from the water itself brought me.. comfort, relieve and relax during the day."
,,Worlds Largest Fountain,5.0,,This is the World's Largest Fountain. Located in the prime location of Suntec City Mall.Nice place to relax and take pics. Ppl also believe in good luck on throwing coins.
,,Wealth Fountain,3.0,,I am not too sure how this works but this Fountain of Wealth is supposed to be auspicious for you. There is nothing much to shout about but it is definitely a decent spot for photography and say that I have been here. One has to go into the centre of the fountain and make a wish and your wish will apparently come true....I hope so:)
,,Chasing wealth,2.0,,Frankly nothing much about it! Just a very modest fountain with a below average design but it may have a relation to chinese mythology as you should wait for the water to stop then enter inside the circle and enjoy being inside this circle of water.
,,A quaint installation.,4.0,,"The combination of the five towers in the shape of the fingers of the left hand with the fountain in the palm of the hand is supposed to symbolise wealth, as does the fountain itself with the inward flowing water jets. Go between 2 - 4 pm. to walk into the fountain and to go around the center jets to make a wish!"
,,Average Fountain,3.0,,"Average fountain, they used to do a light show which they have stopped so its kind of average now. Can stop for five minutes to enjoy the refreshing breeze."
,,Brave the traffic first,1.0,,"Just another fountain, a made up tourist attraction adjacent to a shopping centre selling expensive items. One need to brave the continual busy traffic flow before getting near this concrete monstrosity."
,,Just Another Fountain,3.0,,This fountain is right outside Suntec City Mall. Its more of a decorative piece and does not hold any historical significance. Good to have a look though. We mostly saw it in a non-function state and it was underwhelming.
,,place where I proposed to my Wife ten years ago,3.0,,Back to this fountain again and brought back fond memories. But it used to be better when there were laser shows and music. These days it’s just another fountain.
,,Just a landmark,3.0,,"Nothing remarkable, just only fountain and believe. You can visit here if you have nothing to do so."
,,"It is a fountain, that is all",1.0,,"What is thisvsupposed to be? Fountain of wealth, what sort of? Horrible in the extreme and if wealth meansconly money and technology we will soon bevruked bybrobots and zombies. A must tonavoid!"
,,What Fountain??,1.0,,I cant really comment as it was NEVER turned on. In the entire 6 days we stayed in Singapore we passed it daily if not bi daily and not o ce was it turned on!!!
,,Nice fengshui place,5.0,,Fountain of wealth is a fengshui Fountain. Thoroughly enjoyed it. It's in suntec city. Lovely food options in the food courts too.
,,"A MUST BE DONE ACTIVITY ONCE IN SINGAPORE, NOT TO HAVE REGRETS.",4.0,,"Foutain of wealth is a must be done activity once in Singapore. It is easy to find, easy to reach and do not take much of your time. You can go by day or by night, but better by day if you want to access the inner small fountain, which you should turn around 3x, touching the water with your right hand and make a wish on each turn.
Many people are coming to see this fountain and to make their wish. Whatever if it works or not, do not miss the chance to try it, in order no to have regrets.
I will soon add some photos to my review for you to see what I'm talking about.

otterboris"
,,Not an ordinary sight,3.0,,"Strolling trip for singapore, we have passed by this landmark where a structure or a work of art is alive. A big fountain between the big buildings of Singapore. Not an ordinary sight as it was made good and extraordinaire. We have seen this from above a “balcony” part of a mall."
,,Nothing spectacular,2.0,,Unless you are actually passing this fountain I wouldn’t go out of your way to go and view it. Read it was one of the worlds biggest fountain and was left disappointed....nothing compared to the ballagio fountains in Vegas or even the fountains and lights show at Alton towers. You can go and stand in the middle and throw a coin in and make a wish if you do go and have 5 minutes to waste.
,,Make a Wish,4.0,,Only a short walk from Promenade MRT station. Started here on our evening stroll along the Singapore river.
,,Nice fountain near suntec,3.0,,"This fountain located as exiting promenade mrt,its near suntec mall,good if you happen to be in the area"
,,Worth a Look,4.0,,This is a very large fountain which takes centre place in a traffic roundabout at Suntec City. The fountain is impressive to look at from ground level and we were fortunate enough to have a view from above from our hotel. Worth a look.
,,Huge fountain,4.0,,"The fountain is huge, located in front of Suntec City. There is a sign that describes some ritual related to the fountain, to increase wealth."
,,If you are in the area,3.0,,"During the day the main part of the fountain (the big ring) isn't running. If you are shopping at Suntec city, it's worth stopping by for a look, but I wasn't that impressed."
,,Pretty but not much else,3.0,,"If you happen to be in the area and have some free time, by all means, go visit. Unfortunately this is not really an engaging attraction. Make sure you go below street level as there is a simple water show that is not easily seen from above (you can also dine beside the water)."
,,Fountain is huge,3.0,,It's a huge fountain but they don't have the light show anymore and kids can't play in the water. There are lights but it doesn't have the laser light show anymore
,,Worth watching,4.0,,"It is huge. I did not expect that huge size. It was the first station during my visit in Singapore, and it was a refreshing experience. There is a tradition that you go around three times touching the central 'barrier' and you will be lucky. I think it is nice to go there, shops and restaurants around. Unfortunatelly I did not have the chance to see the light show in the evening."
,,Suntec City fountain of wealth,5.0,,"Great view from restaurant, feeling well. Good location for shopping & walking. Can saw many tourist visit here, free entrance to go in fountain of wealth"
,,nice to look at walking by,4.0,,There are restaurants across the way at Suntec CIty Mall that is nice to watch while eating....or strolling by. Nice fountain.
,,Work hard not only praying for wealth,5.0,,I also came to pray for wealthy and i know that i still have to work harder to get what i pray for. It’s a nice fountain anyway.
,,Just amazing!,5.0,,"So it beautiful! Right at the beginning of Suntec City Mall! Closest MRT Promenade. It opens 3 times in a day, you can go inside touch and feel the water and enjoy!!! Right next to it are many restaurants where you can sit and enjoy the beautiful fountain!"
,,Pray for wealthy,5.0,,"Me and wife came to fountain of wealth for make a wish. 3 times every day, the big fountain stop crushing. So, we can get to the center of the fountain and make a circle walk 3 times while throw a coin to the fountain."
,,Don't base your impression on first sighting,4.0,,"It is easy to dismiss this fountain as just another big thing in a city that prides itself on innovative design. But that would be understating just how well designed and constructed this fountain is. From road level it looks ok, but once you go down to the basement level you see it for the marvel it really is. You can walk right around the base, and there are a couple of vantage points where you can get up to the glass and really get a sense of just how large it is. As you would expect, restaurants have taken the best vantage points next to the glass behind which the fountain sits, but that said, it is a great place to sit and have something to eat and just enjoy this never-ending cascade of water beside you."
,,Drive By,4.0,,We went pass this very cool fountain 2-3 times with the Hop On Hop Off bus Pass. You see it quickly on the Red & Blue line tours. They also have an evening light show if interested check the times
,,Lovely fountain,4.0,,The fountain was beautiful and the kids loved watching it. We all threw in a coin and made a wish. It's a lovely place to take kids to and is really pretty. Would definitely visit The Fountain of Wealth again.
,,How can anyone miss the place which is recognized by GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS.,4.0,,"- It is the largest fountain in the world located at very famous Suntec City Singapore named Fountain of Wealth.

- You can see laser show at night.
- This attraction can be covered with Singapore flyer, metro station will be same for both.
- This fountain is at walkable distance from MRT.

- Surrounding area is very nice to spent your time.

,,Unique attraction,5.0,,"Situated At the Suntek centre the fountain is Really worth a visit, try and time it so you can walk in the fountain to bring Yourself Financial Good Fortune. Visit twice to see it both during the day and at night."
,,World's largest fountain,4.0,,"A symbol of wealth and life,the world's largest fountain and evening the best time to visit .(6pm-7.30pm touch water sessions) after that catch up laser light show."
,,Worth a visit but not spectacular,3.0,,"I saw this being built, and how it has been revamped over the years. So... all I can say is that it is interesting but nothing surprising for me."
,,Blend of modernity and Feng Shui tradition,3.0,,"Singaporeans seem to have a certain fondness for having the first, the biggest, the highest, and other superlatives in the world. Thus you'll find, for example, Jurong Bird Park - the biggest bird park in the world (where you'll also find the highest man-made waterfall in the world!); Singapore Zoo - the biggest tropical forest zoo in the world; the Night Safari is the world's first nocturnal safari park; the infinity pool on the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel is the highest and largest rooftop swimming pool!; the Cloud Forest at the Gardens by the Bay has the highest indoor waterfall in the world; etc. Now add to the list the Fountain of Wealth at Suntec City Mall.

The Fountain of Wealth is said to be the biggest fountain in the world (according to the 1998 Guinness Book of Records)! It is 13.8 meters high and has a circular ring which is 66 meters in circumference, supported by four columns or legs. Its water flows continuously except from 10:00 AM to 12:00 noon, 2:00-4:00 PM and 6:00-7:30 PM when they shut down the water to enable curious visitors to go to the center of the fountain, make three rounds (if i remember right) around it and touch the waters of a small fountain in it. This is believed to bring good luck (especially wealth, since water is a symbol of wealth, according to Chinese Feng Shui!).

If you don't believe in Feng Shui, you can still visit the fountain just to have some photos taken there or watch its display of laser lights at night and listen to its music. You can also try some really good foods in one of the restaurants around the fountain area, or buy anything you want in the mall's chic shops."
,,WASTE OF TIME,1.0,,"Really a waste of my time and money. Brought my friend from overseas there as I thought it would be interesting but apparently it's nothing more than just a lame water fountain. No idea how it got into the Guinness book either. It's really a waste of time. Crappy piece of architecture as well if you can even call it architecture. More like fountain of well because that's just what it is. And because we were there for this lame thing, we were fined $100 for parking in a reserved lot when there was no indication that we could not park there. Apparently the notice for parking at reserved lot was facing the other direction away from us! Really ineffective planning and logistics. Fountain of wealth my foot. Only wealth for them because people pay to go there to waste their time and money!

Very quiet mall as well. The food wasn't good, the shopping wasn't great. Nothing was good. Not worth the time at all. Time better spent at the Esplanade, Flyer, MBS or Gardens by the Bay. Oh and park at Marina Square if you're driving down."
,,Fountain of wealth..,4.0,,"Fountain of wealth, one of the guinness attraction of the world largest fountain is located near the suntec city shopping mall. Visitors are allowed to walk around the mini fountain during certain periods of the day when the fountain is switched off. They can collect coins form the base which is supposed to bring fmgiid fortune. Laser light shows are there at night time. I visited this place as a part of the sight seeing trip. Never miss this location."
,,Grand Fountain.,4.0,,I think this looks best from the outside escalator going up to the Sky Garden. It looks quite grand from up there. It is also interesting from underneath- go into the Bottom of Suntec Tower 2 I think it might be- not sure- but there are cafes there if you wanted to sit at the base of the fountain. You can go out to it also if you walk right round that area in a circle to find the entrance to it. It provides the focal point for the hub outside Suntec City Mall and is a central feature in the Plaza.
,,An enjoyable place if you are nearby,4.0,,"This is near Suntec City mall and set down below street level in the middle of a roundabout. You can view from above or access the middle of the fountain itself from the shopping mall below. Basically it's a series of water jets in a circular space that intermittently come on and off in different patterns. There is a central fountain bit and people seemed to be walking around it in circles for luck.
In the U.K. this place would inevitably have loads of people running around in the water jets but of course in SP where standards of behaviour are much more controlled it is a very much more sedate experience as people follow the rules and stick to the pathway or get quickly and severely told off. Not sure which I prefer, sometimes SP lacks a bit of spontaneity!"
,,Interesting to take a look if you are nearby,3.0,,A different kind of fountain for a European. If you are nearby come take a look but definitely don't make it a must see site for your trip.
,,No Trevi... but something else.,3.0,,"The fountain acts as a round-a-bout, so it's neither serene nor somewhere you would spend any time. What it is good for, as attested to by some cheeky Igers toeing the line of the law, is night time drone shots. The skyscrapers surrounding, and the sheer size of the fountain make for very impressive photographs.

Hot tip: droning here is a grey area of the law. Scout out first and find a rooftop carpark to launch where you won't be bothered by busybody dogooders."
,,Still pretty cool after all these years,5.0,,"You will still see quite a lot of people here. After so many years the fountain of wealth still draw people and is still beautiful.

There is a singapore pools outlet nearby if you wish to test out your luck after visiting the fountain of wealth."
,,Have a look if at Suntec City Mall,3.0,,"Nothing special, but worth to have a look if in the area anyhow. It also seems to be easier to get a taxi here in the evening than at other locations."
,,Fountain of wealth,3.0,,"Enjoyed 7 nights at Conrad overlooking the Fountain of wealth, this is nothing special, do not waste a taxi fare to see, it is not worth it."
,,Good to pass by,3.0,,"I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this fountain. It's kind of in the middle of the road, in front of Suntec Mall. We basically walked past to take a snap then continued on to the shopping centre."
,,Nice but not a must see,3.0,,"If you are looking for something to do, seeing the fountain is an ok way to pass your time. There is a large mall/shopping complex around it. You could just catch a bus and that goes past it and be done."
,,Ordinary good fountain,3.0,,It is just an beautiful fountain in the middle of the road. Not much to see. There are better around City
,,Make a Wish After Turn 3 rounds,5.0,,"Fountain of Wealth located inside the Suntec City. The Guinness Book Of World Records as the World's Largest Fountain since 1998. The fountain will turn off at 10am - 12pm and 2pm - 4pm to make the visitor go to basement to take a walk the little fountain three times and touching the water at all times, would gain some good luck of their own."
,,see in a jiffy or chuck !!,4.0,,this could be given a 5 min time if you are on the run...or could be skipped completely..not necessarily a must do thing in Singapore !!
,,One of the biggest fountain in the world,4.0,,"If you read the story, Fountain of Wealth is part of Suntec City and located in the ""palm"" area. The structure was built using FengShui calculation which makes it more interesting and mystical. It is said that if you touch the water in the middle and walk around 3 times while making a wish, it will come true."
,,Spectacular foyntain,5.0,,We came here twice. Once at night to see it all lit up with the water going and then once during the day to gain access to the ground floor and look up. It is the worlds largest fountain and free to visit!
,,Fun fountain,3.0,,"The fountain was very impressive in size, we visited during the day time and I think it might be better in the dark when it's illuminated. We did the obligatory three rotations round the innermost circle whilst touching the water to bring us good fortune and wealth.

It was a fairly fun thing to do but not worth a detour,"
,,Romance is in the air,5.0,,"They have some kind of laser show and the water was changing colors. Best visited at night, with your loved one."
,,It's just ok,5.0,,"It's big and it jets water, nothing unusual. Had a look at night too, it's got some laser lighting which makes it nicer but nothing special."
,,Best at night,3.0,,This fountain is architecturally interesting and does have variations in firing of water jets but not overly fascinating. It is interesti g to see the many people who venture out to touch the water in the belief of getting good fortune.
,,Beautiful at night,4.0,,"Lovely piece of architecture that is very impressive at night. I wouldn't suggest going out of your way to visit it, but if you are in the area then you may as well."
,,Sight seeing,3.0,,"A giant man made fountain where tourists circle and touch the waters , in the belief that it brings good luck"
,,"Nice, we expected more",4.0,,Our expectations were to see something breathtaking. But its just a fountain with adjusted timing of jets)))
,,Free spot to see water fountain shows,4.0,,No music but the fountain sprays water in rhythms and in bursts. Great to bring your kids as the water display is impressive to the little ones.
,,"It was ok, not a must see",3.0,,"It was ok, it's much more interesting at night as other reviewers have mentioned. During the day it is basically an ornament for a roundabout, a bit like the traffic light artwork piece in Canary Wharf in London.

Worth a visit if you're around the area just to get a snap and tick it off the list but I wouldn't bother otherwise.

You could always get a pic of it whilst passing by, by bus..."
,,"Interesting fountain, worth a visit",4.0,,This is a very large fountain with an interesting design. Located with shopping mall so there is no admission. Well worth a visit to see this unique fountain.
,,Size isn't everything,1.0,,"The Fountain of Wealth is apparently one of the largest fountains in existence, and it looks interesting when illuminated at night (providing some life and colour in the depressing concrete jungle of Suntec City) but during the day it looks quite hideous.

Singapore has numerous examples of spectacular modern architecture and design - in my opinion the F of W is not one of them. Not likely to bring you wealth either, as you are more likely to spend money in the mall than win any..."
,,Refreshing on A Hot Night,5.0,,"Tucked inside this Suntec city is this fountain which closes at 7.30pm sharp.

Walk to the centre and amidst spraying jets of fountain water in colourful lights.

Be prepared to get a bit wet from the water spray and have a refreshing time after a hot day in this humid city.

Fun thing to do after shopping and dinner with children.

Great for family and teenagers, young or older generation."
,,Still Waiting,4.0,,"Really loved this area and shopping mall.
The story was that if you walked round the fountain you would get wealth. I did this but am still waiting for my wealth to arrive....! Did not see it at evening time so must make a return visit."
,,Peaceful and free,5.0,,"I stumbled upon this on a long walk. Very glad I did, there was something about it that made me really happy. It might of been the large group of tourists that put their hands in it and walked around, it was lovely. All the skyscrapers seemed to be surrounding it"
,,Great Fountain with Light Effects at Night,4.0,,It is a nice place to enjoy some peaceful time away from the crowded tourist attractions. There are great options for dining and shopping at the Suntec Center surrounding this fountain. The lightings at night a nice.
,,A huge fountain,4.0,,"Suntec City is a nice place to go dine and shop, and this fountain of wealth in the middle is just great. It looks even better at night. There are certain portions of the day when you can go up and close with the fountain and perform the little ritual of turning around three times counterclockwise and throwing in a coin for prosperity and wealth. Good stuff."
,,Huge fountain at Suntec,4.0,,"This is the fountain you can find at Suntec place, the shoppingmall which excists out of 5 huge towers. Its special and especially at night when they switch on the lights. When you go shopping in Suntec just have a look."
,,So nice!!,4.0,,This is a really nice place to visit with family. Suntec is filled with interesting things to do and this is one of them. I went with my grandparenst and they enjoyed it.
,,What the Fuss!,1.0,,"Such a disappointing piece of attraction. I simply don't understand why it is even there in the list of things to do in Singapore. Visit it only if you are waiting for your duck tour and have some 30-40 minutes to kill, as its walkable from there."
,,Fun and different,4.0,,Not your typical recommendation but this fountain is cool in that twice a day it is partially shut off so you can go inside and walk around and touch the water. Grab a yummy ice cream of lunch from the myriad of food places around the fountain afterwards.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Visit at 8pm to see the light show - the waterfall, which is supposed to be the biggest , is lit up and dances with amazing colours :)"
,,Super spectacle and for free !,5.0,,"You get close by entering the subway to the food court and then ascending flights of stairs. Its a great sight in the evening with many different water jets, multicoloured lights and all set to music. We ate at the Thai restaurant in the food court, very good food and at a very reasonable price"
,,Lights and water,4.0,,"A large fountain with work of lights (after sunset) and water. Featured in Bollywood movie named ""Krish""."
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"The structure itself is not particularly attractive, however the display of dancing water it produces certainly is. Last time I was here we made a specific visit to view the fountain, this time is was simply part of a visit to Suntec City. Worth a look but perhaps best in the evening with the added attraction of the illumination."
,,Amazing,4.0,,After finding the entrance the children enjoyed partaking in the traditional walk around three times to make a wish for good fortune. Was amazing to experience and was rewarding after the lengthy shop in Suntec.
,,Art & Water,5.0,,An impressive water fall fountain in the centre of the shopping & hotel district. Worth a look if you are in the area.
,,Better to do a night time visit,3.0,,"As other reviewers have said, it's better to visit the fountain the evening when the fountain is illuminated. However if you do visit during the day it's better to make it part of a general sightseeing tour/walk. The fountain was a lot bigger than I expected and is a nice example of modern art. Take plenty of photos !!"
,,Nice place,4.0,,"This place is located at Suntec City Plaza in City Hall. You can travel to the location by taking a MRT to City Hall , taking a bus or taxi.

I have previously visited this place about 2 years ago. It is something like a roundabout fountain. This place is good for photography activity as well."
,,Great view at night,5.0,,"The fountain at night is mind-blowing. The light, music and choreography are just amazing, you really forget time just gazing at the jumping water and dazzling light."
,,Overrated Until You See The Night View!,3.0,,"Do you want a wish to come true? Then visit the Fountain of Wealth. Make a wish while your right hand is in the water of the rising fountain and then walk completely around the fountain three times.

This experience plus the surrounding tremendous mall can make your many wishes come true, as long as your credit card holds out!"
,,Fountain of water.,3.0,,Its a nice fountain on a roundabout. They had a concert here NYE but no western stars just local singers etc. Worth a look when you walk past. You can get a room i Conrad and look at it if you want to get wealth lol
,,Lucky charm,4.0,,"This fountain is located right at the centre of suntec city, which is a huge shopping mall cum offices in Singapore. There is also a convention hall within the compound too. People can just accessed the fountain using an entrance at Basement one near the giant supermarket."
,,Visit at night,3.0,,I think its worth the effort to visit it as in the morning its just another fountain .At night Heard its better as Song and laser shows or something
,,Waste of effort and resources..,3.0,,"This entire area is reclaimed and now developed as suntec city. And the fountain of fortune happens to be plonked right in the middle. It is touted to be one of the largest fountains, but trust me, it hardly captures your imagination.

Neither in the concept nor in the architecture. looks like a misfit in the neighbourhood."
,,It was closed when we went,3.0,,there are timings and if were to see it then we had to wait for an hour or so. 2 pm is one of the time slots. So check the time before you go. It looks grand and we could snap some photos. couldnt walk around since it was closed.
,,Regarded as one of the largest fountain of wealth!,4.0,,"Sited in the ground floor of the Suntec shopping mall, it is the centre of the mall. You can walk around the fountain along well constructed walkway and get to make a wish. A tourist attraction."
,,It's just a big fountain,3.0,,"This is located inside Suntec City mall. However, it's only open to public during certain times. One can walk around the fountain to have better luck but I don't it is a must do for tourists esp. if u don't have the time..."
,,Getting some luck,4.0,,"Located in the hub of Suntec City, the Fountain of Wealth is known as one of the largest water fountains in the world. Once night descends, it is the setting for laser performances, and even song and laser dedications. Not just beautiful at night it also symbolises life and wealth and was built according to feng shui principles. Come for a light show and you may just leave luckier than before!"
,,Doesn't operate all the time,4.0,,"Unfortunately the fountain doesn't fully operate all the time, when we went there were just some jets at the bottom operating, not a good enough attraction to rearrange your itinerary to see it fully operating."
,,Disappointed beyond doubt,1.0,,This One's a Guiness awarded and world's largest fountain and yet the treatment and light show disappointment me enough to NEVER RECOMMEND it to anyone. This one should be off your itinerary. Time better spent elsewhere.
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,"Visiting the Fountain of Wealth was an amazing experience. Located in Suntec City, this fountain holds the Guinness World Record for the largest fountain in the world. You can even go up close to it!"
,,Fountain of wealth,5.0,,"This is a tourist place in the middle of Suntec City . The water pours down at regular intervals and beneath there are many restaurants . So the feel is very gd . They have a wishing well also . They say keep ur right hand out a
In the fountain and take 3 rounds and wish . The wish will be granted . It's fun"
,,Water water everywhere,4.0,,"This is a nice BIG fountain which can be seen from above or below where you can get something to eat while looking at the vast amounts of water spurted all over the place. Be careful of the well dressed Indian men at the top who hang around (it looks like they are trying to pray on single women). When I intervened the guy said ""Take my photo"" rude and could be a danger so be on your guard."
,,worth a visit,4.0,,"its an experience, its worth a visit specially when shopping at the suntec city. I am still doubtful if it the world's biggest fountain."
,,Blessing,4.0,,"Was shopping and lunching at Suntec City.

Dropped by the basement to visit Fountain of Wealth. Visitors are permitted into the fountain area at selected hours. Believed that walked three rounds touching the sprouting well water will bring good luck.

Hopeful to receive good blessings for the many days ahead. Enjoyed."
,,Trip to Singapore,4.0,,"One of the largest foundtains of the world according to Guinness book of records. Please check the daily program as during a certain period of the day, the fountain is just operating in a turned-off mode to allow visitors to access the base of the fountain."
,,Decent enough,4.0,,Located outdoors in the centre of the five towers is the fountain of wealth. At certain times you can get to walk outside and around it where you are supposed to place your right hand in the water at the centre and walk round three times. Access is from the bottom floor
,,Nice spot,4.0,,"I am my friends we were that at night unfortunately we unable to get into the Fountain just over looked from the top at the main road however it beautiful itself, we love there, would recommend to all."
,,One of the worlds largest fountains,4.0,,"The fountain of wealth, is one of the largest fountains in the world, it sits as the hub, of one of Singapores largest shopping malls, suntec city It also comes alive at night."
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"The fountain itself mayn't be such a big attraction but when it is coupled with the surroundings and the mall, it is worth a visit if you have got time to kill"
,,Pretty at night,4.0,,Traffic continuously flows around the fountain. I was lucky to see this from above. Much better to view in the evening. Close to Promenade station.
,,Relaxing,3.0,,"Strange to say but you.may have some peaceful time.when you turn around the fountain. So many people are turning everyday. The funtain is just in front of Suntec City tower 1,3 and 4."
,,Just a fountain really,3.0,,"The Fountain of Wealth is just that - a fountain.

In my opinion it is not worth a detour to experience, however if you're in the area it might be worth noting that the fountain is slightly more impressive below ground level. There is a shopping mall with a lot of restaurants in the basement around the fountain, with glass walls surrounding the fountain."
,,Just a Fountain,3.0,,"It is a fountain outside SUNTEC CITY. They Call it fountain of wealth. I don't find anything special in it. For me it was just an ordinary fountain which was not running the time I visited this place. They should run the fountain in day too.

Tour guide told us that It was listed as the biggest fountain in Guinness Book of Records and the there is a lazer show every night."
,,Nice to see if you happen to be in the area,3.0,,..but I wouldn't make a special trip! Located in one of my least favourite malls (Suntec) this is nice to see when the water is flowing but not really worth a special trip. If you're going to Suntec to catch the hop on hop off bus or ducktours then pop over to see it.
,,It's Just a Fountain but it's good,5.0,,"It's kind of a neat fountain to see. I mean i don't really get excited about these kinds of things and I didn't get excited about this either. But it's still a nice fountain and I looked at it and it's unique and ok to see and then I went on with my night. So if you're in the area, it's worth stopping by."
,,Fontan of wealth,3.0,,"Situated in front of the huge Suntec mall and anounced to be the world largest fontain, it was nothing special in my opinion. Neither beautiful nor interesting in some way."
,,Synonymous with Suntec City,4.0,,"We passed The Fountain of Wealth on several occasions on our Hop On Hop Off Bus as it made its way to the Suntec City Hub.

Great views from the bus but lack of time, given our short visit to Singapore, precluded us from visiting in the evening when they put on a laser display."
,,Needs Lots Of Luck,4.0,,"Fountain of Wealth is located at Suntec City Shopping Mall. Nearest MRT are Esplanade or Promenade.

Every afternoon at selected time, visitors are allowed into the fountain to touch the lucky water which will beings about good luck. It is also a ""wishing fountain"". One needs to touch the lucky water and walk round the fountain 3 rounds, simultaneously citing the wish.

In the evening (after 7pm), there will be a light and water shows at the Fountain of Wealth too. Can enjoy the show whike sipping a cup at one of the few restaurants by the Fountain of Well. A colourful experience."
,,Not that impressive,3.0,,"We walked to the fountain from the Flyer and after to be honest it was actually quite unimpressive. One would think that the ""Largest Fountain in the East"" would be, we'll just more
Maybe the water touching ceremony is awesome but we couldn't do one so in my opinion don't bother taking the time"
,,Refreshing and Amazing,5.0,,"I thought fountain could not be as big as like this. It brings to my mind the idea of having a sort of fireworks in a water. How I wished I could take a bath inside it. With the site like that, all your worries and problems will dissipate for a moment. Quite an impressive feat and achievement! I truly love Singapore as my second home next to Philippines!"
,,Seeing it from the hop on bus,3.0,,"If you ride the hop on hop off busses, you'll see this each time entering Suntec city hub. It was always doing something different. Huge structure, fun to see. But we only did see it from the bus!!!!"
,,View from our room.,4.0,,We saw this every time we looked out of our hotel room and loved it every time. During the day we would watch the tourists getting wet and at night would watch the light displays. We even went ourselves as it is supposed to promote wealth and happiness. I hope so. Then we can come back! Its also a good way to cool off in the day.
,,Fountain,4.0,,This is a huge fountain.A good place to hang out.There are enough food out lets around.This is good for family and friends.
,,It's huge!,4.0,,One of the largest fountains anywhere. At one time at least it was the largest in the world. On the lower level are restaurants. On the upper level your kids can throw their pacifiers into the fountain for parents to then go and try to find. (True story!)
,,Suntec City,5.0,,"great fountain, it's huge..!! lovely to watch during the evening, sensational lighting & makes a great opportunity for photo's."
,,Really nice place.,4.0,,"The story about the fountain is cool, but the look of it is even cooler. During the day the fountain is playing around with different streams and you can enter inside to watch it closer.

During the dark times it is lighted and the fountain is shooting straight up and no entering that time.

Nice place overall, with all the buildings around. A must see at the evenings!"
,,One very big fountain,3.0,,"If you're reading this, you clearly must have visited everything singapore has to offer and you'r leaving this for last.
Clearly, this isn't a tourist attraction, but if you can if you like it to be.
It is really just a corporate sculpture to bring luck to the property and property developers. Surrounding the fountain are 4 office towers and a convention center. and it's ok if you don't believe in feng shui or this superstition, but this property is home to some of the biggest companies in singapore, asia and the world."
,,Nice place to relax,4.0,,its good to see a water fountain in a busy place. i have not seen people throwing coins and wishing for good luck
,,"Quite Interesting, but only if in the area",3.0,,"This has clearly important symbolism for the Chinese, but those of us who aren't Chinese still can appreciate the way the fountain changes all the time. Children, esp., will enjoy it."
,,Not much to see,2.0,,"there is a belief that if you walk through the fountain, your wealth will increase. If you're interested in that sort of thing, then this definitely isnt a stop I would recommend for you."
,,It's a round-about,3.0,,"Cant say anything more than that ... oh and there is a fountain in the middle. As roundabouts go, its quite nice, but lets not get too excited here."
,,Evening Dancing Fountain Show,5.0,,"In the evening they have dancing fountain show at around 6 pm, which spectacular. Must watch after the show take photograph by going inside the ring."
,,Keep driving,3.0,,By the time you have driven around it in a car or a bus you will probably have spent enough time looking at it. beyond that it's nothing more than a water feature.
,,Not really an Attraction but not so Bad!,3.0,,"Usually (as they said) during the day, the fountain is turned off and visitors are invited to walk around a mini fountain at the center of the fountain's base. At night, the fountain is the setting for laser performances, as well as live song and laser message dedications.
But sadly, during day time, it is a roundabout where cars use to move from one direction to the other.
At night, we just snap couple of photo and go. Not so bad at all."
,,An interesting fountain,4.0,,"Not really worth the trip down for visitors I think. If you'd like to see it, I think it's neat to take the 111 bus - which runs down orchard rd, past raffles (which is an interesting area to get off and walk around in) loops round the fountain and then takes you back up to the back of the orchard malls with cool views of the bay along the way."
,,A stunning sculpture and interesting fountain,4.0,,This landmark is a stunning sculpture and interesting fountain that was operating when we visited. The size of the fountain itself is quite spectacular and is an interesting stop off when visiting Suntec Mall.
,,This is not an attraction,1.0,,I don't think this qualifies as an attraction. This is a roundabout where cars use to move from one direction to the other.
,,nothing really special fountain.,3.0,,"I didn't find it special. maybe there are a lot better fountains through the world. But well, if you need some rest while walking or moving, you will be able to fell relaxed watching it."
,,Raina,3.0,,Visited during the day. A nice place to walk around. However no sitting place around leaves you with little time to hang around or rest tired feet
,,Good feeling,5.0,,"When you reach near to this place, all around is mist and it feels that you will make good money in near future."
,,Biggest Fountain of Wealth,4.0,,It's a large Fountain of Wealth. This is situated in the Suntec City Singapore. I went on a day time but it will be more beautiful in evening and night.
,,Clever,5.0,,"A very clever , and very large sculptural water fountain that dominates a roundabout and is the centrepiece of a shopping centre , clever by day , becomes brilliant by night when lit by normal and coloured lighting and the water patters become more ""playful"" , you can walk it to the centre too , from shopping centre access , children love it , free and fun"
,,stunning performance!!!,5.0,,"More interesting to visit in the night time, when the fountain is lit up with multi colored lights which provides a beautiful sight to watch. there is also a wishing area, where you can touch the water and put some wish! have patience and wait all the performance! the fountain of wealth is definitely unique place!"
,,A fountain,3.0,,A pretty cool fountain. Very special and uniq design so its well worth a visit to take a look. Also a great place to grab a bit to eat.
,,Being Generous With Very Good.,4.0,,"This is not a tourist attraction must do but if you are in the area you may as well stop and have a look.
I could not be bothered waiting in line for ages just to walk around inside the fountain when it was shut down.
Easier just to look from street level.
I didn't think much of the Suntec Centre in general as the cigarette butts and general rubbish laying around was very un Singapore."
,,worth a visit if you are in the area.....but after dusk,4.0,,"during the day it is fir to say it is just a fountain, albeit a big one with complex water flow variations. But at night it lights up (literally) and uses a multitude of colours to enhance the water display. Then it is worth seeing - must be honest we got a great view from our room in the Conrad Hotel on the 31st floor,"
,,Singapore fountain main landmark,5.0,,"Singapore fountain main landmark is where everyone goes when they are in suntec city, including myself. Whenever we are here, my toddler loves to walk in when the fountain stops for people to go in ."
,,You can male a wish,4.0,,สวยงามกว่าที่คิด อธิษฐานขอพร วิวถ่ายรูปน้ำพุ ล้อมรอบด้วยตึกซันเทคสวยมาก This Fountain is more beautiful than I thought. You can make a wish. You can enjoy take photo of this fountain with many Suntec building.
,,Good for a short visit!,4.0,,"this was surely a unique fountain created by an amazing brain. it is great if you visit in the evening as the entire fountain is operational. in between there are few hours during which you can enter the fountain and touch the water in between.

overall it was a unique experience."
,,Average Fountain,3.0,,I would say that this is an average fountain - named as Fountain of Wealth. It is located at Suntec City though it will be good to see during night.
,,Not in the morning,1.0,,"I was there at 11am and not only is it a very big fountain but at 11am it is a VERY BORING fountain-not much water. Someone told me later you have to go a night, well they should put that in the guide books. It is in the very boring Suntec complex which seems to have been built with the future in mind -at the moment it is empty and the fountain below ground is cased in horrible glass which needs cleaning or replacing, not very viewer friendly."
,,"Yep, it's a fountain",2.0,,"Well, they say that this is one of the biggest fountains in the world, but I only found that out after I visited the place. Then again, if I had known that I probably would have looked at it and said 'gee, that's a big fountain' and walked on. Instead, as I was coming down the escalators from the sky garden, I looked at it and said 'gee, so that's the Fountain of Wealth' and proceeded to move on. Mind you, due to it's size, it is probably not that easy to miss, but it is probably just one of those places that you and look at, take a couple of photos, and the go somewhere more interesting."
,,Landmark,3.0,,The Fountain of Wealth is one interesting location in the heart of Suntec City. It opens the space inside this huge shopping location.
,,Isn't worth a visit unless you go shopping in Suntec,3.0,,"Despite the fact that many guidebooks mention this fountain, I personally do not recommend it. Yes it's a fountain, a big fountain that you can feel the power of water when you are shopping in the basement of Suntec City, but that's it. In short, if you are going to shop in Suntec City, which is really a spacious mall with multifarious kinds of shops, do have a glimpse of the fountain. Otherwise, spare your time for other scenic spots in Singapore."
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"Nothing special. We’ve discovered it by an accident when were looking for a vegetarian food at Suntec Mall.
We looked at it for a 5 min and went back to the mall searching for food.

Would not recommend to make a special effort to go there."
,,A good example of practical feng shui,5.0,,"This is the most prolific example of feng shui, where this fountain ensures that the wealth flows to the tenants in the nearby office buildings (if you believe in them). At certain time, you can go under the main fountain ring, stick your hand into the smaller fountain and wish for good luck."
,,"Not worth the travel, visit if you're in the area",3.0,,"This fountain has lost its charm, it used to be a big thing in the past with the locals, people coming to dedicate messages which can be cast by laser onto the fountain. These days, it's practically dead except for the occasional tourist."
,,A Fountain at Suntec Mall,3.0,,This Fountain is popular with locals as it is called the fountain of wealth at certain times of the day and evening the middle of the fountain is turned off so you can drop some coins in the fountain and wish/pray for wealth a lot of locals splash water over each other as this is considered good luck also(beware of the long lines). It s a good place to take a photo at any time of the day or night and inside the mall itself is a great place for many different types of food.
,,The only nice thing is that it is possible to walk into the middle of the fountain,3.0,,"For me this fountain showed nothing really special, only 5 seconds of interest while I walked into the middle.
I found the way from the shopping mall, of course it was crowded, and I had to wait for a while to walk into the middle. At least it is free."
,,Suntec surprise,4.0,,"Another ‘world’s largest’, in Singapore the Fountain of Wealth is for great night photos. During certain periods of the day, the fountain is turned off and visitors are invited to walk around a mini fountain at the center of the fountain's base to collect coins for good luck. At night, the fountain is the setting for laser performances, as well as live song and laser message dedications between 8pm to 9pm daily. It is situated in such a way the fountain is the hub of the Suntec shopping mall (open from 10-10). The bronze ring of the fountain is designed based on the Hindu Mandala, meaning universe and is a symbolic representation of the oneness in spirit and unity and further symbolizes the equality and harmony of all races and religions in Singapore. Suntec is close to the Singapore flyer about 8 mins walk."
,,Beautiful at night,3.0,,Do drop by to take a look if you are at suntec city. It's is suppose to be a palm and the office towers the fingers. Apparently this is for fengshui. At night there will be laser with music playing hence its more beautiful.
,,Enjoy with the fountain and good restaurants !,4.0,,"Good place to go in Singapore, after finish with the fountain you can enjoy with the restaurant and shops at Suntce city. Be careful with time (water touching)"
,,A nice treat,3.0,,This fountain is found in Suntec City. It is one of the largest if not the largest fountain in the world so itnis worth a visit. The best place to come is late afternoon because of the laser lights so it looks amazing. Kids would love this for sure.
,,Worth a visit and is beautiful at night.,4.0,,"This is a nice place to stop by while roaming around for a nice photo shoot and if you happen to stop by at night, you're in for a treat.. the beautiful lighting on the fountain makes it a beautiful scene that you have stare for hours... If you aren't in a rush, it sure is a nice place to stop by."
,,Okay for Kids,3.0,,"If you are going to Suntec City to shop, visiting this place is not a bad idea. Also a good place to visit if you have small children who can still get attracted with lights and water. But don't spend your time if you just intend to see the fountain, you can go somewhere else for a better attraction or entertainment."
,,Good to see!,5.0,,"Located near Suntec City mall, this fountain was designed baqsed on principle of fengshui, as inward flow water signify wealth flow to the owner/mall.
There are four tall and one not-so-tall towers depicting four fingers and thumb, and fountain is located in place of palm. You can enjoy the fountain in the vening when it has changing colors."
,,OK at best,3.0,,The fountain of wealth really needs to be seen from high above. Suntec is designed to be five buildings (fingers) closing on the fountain. You can see this from the basement area where there are many restaurants. I would not make a special effort to see it at all.
,,Worth visit.,3.0,,Excellent location to spend evening with family:-) it is actually based on the Hindu mandala concept. Four tall towers are like four fingers and tower 5is like thumb. And fountain is placed at the palm. As per palmestru the line of wealth is on palm.
,,superb!!,5.0,,hear its the only fountain in which water runs downwards..the surrounding suntec city with malls and convention centre is just superb!!
,,Just a fountain,3.0,,"They said you could pray for wealth by touching the fountain and walking around the fountain for 3 times. However, it just the fountain, nothing special but if you go to shopping at Suntec, visit fountain is not any bad idea."
,,Nice Fountain,4.0,,"A beautiful fountain at the heart of Suntec City Mall. Visitors are able to have a walk around the fountain when it's opened. At times, you can dedicate a song with special light effects for your love ones at a price."
,,It's more than just a Street Fountain,4.0,,"The fountain can be first viewed at street level in the central roundabout of Suntec City but go to the food court at level B1 of Suntec Mall to see the water shooting up at different heights and to be able to walk out into the middle of the fountain. The fountain alternated between street level fountain with water coming out of the cylindrical top and the floor holes at basement level. You can view it all at the food court.
At night the water has different colours to add a new dimension to the display.
Well worth a visit but not sure if the walk to the middle is free or if there is a fee."
,,Must see while in the heart of the city,5.0,,Very neat with english translations. People are so freindly super clean one of my favourite places in the world to visit and work.
,,One of the highlights of Suntec City,4.0,,"This is one of the highlight of Suntec City.

This fountain was designed with fengshui in mind, which water flowing inwards from a round ring supported by 4 pillars. The water flowing inwards signify wealth flowing into the mall.

At certain times of the day, they allow guests to walk around the central part of the fountain, which has bubbling water fountain. Circling this fountain several times is believed to bring wealth and good fortune."
,,Always tranquil,5.0,,Go early to a morning or evening session and you will usually miss the queues. They usually only allow a certain number of people in at a time so the the experience is tranquil. My husband a I always visit the Fountain of Wealth when in Singapore and have had some interesting results following our visit. I recommend a visit.
,,If you believe,3.0,,"Suntech city is a good place to Explore and you might get some good deal to shop where u can visit the Fountain of the Wealth and drop a coin and ask for the wealth who knows you might be lucky one! , certainly of the biggest to see and good to place to relax if you are tired of going around the shops in the complex but only when there is no exhibitions around."
,,No show here,1.0,,"I have been here at feb 2015. Wait until 9pm and nothing no see, no laser show, no music, and nobody tell me about why no show. Don't waste time go here."
,,Impressive Water Fountain,3.0,,"Set around the convention center, it is usually quiet when there are no exhibitions. A site worthy of some photos, but not worth making a special trip just for that."
,,The largest fountain in the world,3.0,,"The Fountain of Wealth is listed by the Guinness Book of Records in 1998 as the largest fountain in the world. It is located in one of Singapore's largest shopping malls, Suntec City.

During certain periods of the day, the fountain is turned off and visitors are invited to walk around a mini fountain at the centre of the fountain's base to collect coins for good luck. At night, the fountain is the setting for laser performances, as well as live song and laser message dedications between 8pm to 9pm daily.

The intention is good, but what has been achieved is not very artistic nor sophisticated enough."
,,Nothing there,1.0,,"I went there at night for watching the lights show. It was terrible, nothing special AT ALL!!! Do not waste your valuable time."
,,"Ha ha, very funny",1.0,,"Maybe it's me, maybe it's because I have seen the fantastic Dubai fountain that I cannot appreciate this amazing creation, but really this so-called attraction is a JOKE.
Located within yet another sad shopping mall come office center, I really cannot see the point of even going there, unless of course you work in one of the towers and you have no other choice. There is some water coming up from underneath. Fine. That's it.
So be prepared for a big disappointment.
Have a look at the pictures.
I am also wondering were the name comes from. Wealth?
Conclusion: Don't bother"
,,Average,3.0,,"It was okay, but nothing special. Saw this during the day but loads better at night with the lights."
,,go during touch water timings,3.0,,"this site gives you updated touch water timings: http://www.sunteccity.com.sg/fountain_of_wealth.php

there are instructions to help you in your wish-making process, and a guard at the entrance to make sure that the place doesn't get overcrowded.

for food, food republic is a good food court to sample various cuisines. highly recommended is the chinese roasted meats stall where you can get a large sharing platter for $28.

pepperoni pizzeria also sells super big pizzas at $50 each. 21 inches, recommended to feed 4-6 each. http://peperoni.com.sg/menu/pizza"
,,What and whom to wish!,3.0,,"They say its wish fountain but you don't know whom you are wishing to, its just a upside down fountain with a big ring which is high. Nothing big deal about it. anyways you don't have to pay anything to wish here so give it a try may be your wish could come true. some say your wish could be granted in few minutes only.. now thats fast if its true.."
,,Nothing to get too excited about,3.0,,"I had a quick look at the fountain today after having eaten lunch in the vicinity. It's certainly a reasonable size and looks attractive enough, but it's really just a big fountain. Perhaps it's more impressive at night."
,,Big deal!,2.0,,It's a fountain. It's not particularly aesthetic or unique. I don't know what the fuss is all about! Has it really brought wealth to anyone? I doubt it. There is no point in coming here unless you are visiting Suntec City itself for shopping.
,,Cool experience,4.0,,"I had a cool experience at the fountain of wealth because I like getting splashed and also love jumping on the water,I also incredibly loved the idea of tossing a coin into the well and make a wish and then walking about 3-5 times then maybe your wish will be granted,or maybe it wouldn't.

IT IS COOL because:
I wished for a video game and it actually came true
I do trust this fountain of wealth for ALL my wishes"
,,Impressive!,4.0,,"If you are planning on visiting Suntec which is one of the largest shopping malls and conventions centers in Singapore, then I would suggest you pop out and see the impressive and colorful, particularly at night, Fountain of Wealth.

Nice place for a photograph if you get the lighting right!"
,,Good,5.0,,It is just the fountain. It is huge. You feel fresh near it. It is in the Suntec city mall. I believe no matter whether to visit during the day or evening
,,Don't spend time here!,2.0,,Only the mighty frame of the fountain impresses me. Illumination and fountains aren't so wonderful. In Singapore there are so many more interesting places.
,,An interesting sight,4.0,,"We visited this site as part of a bigger tour of the city, it was great to see it close up, an amazing concept"
,,Beautiful Fountain,5.0,,"Visited Jan 2015. The Fountain of Wealth is listed by the Guinness Book of Records in 1998 as the largest fountain in the world. It is located in one of Singapore's largest shopping malls, Suntec City. This beautiful fountain is made of silicon bronze. The bronze ring of the fountain is designed based on the Hindu Mandala, meaning universe and is a symbolic representation of the oneness in spirit and unity and further symbolizes the equality and harmony of all races and religions in Singapore. This is a free attraction and not mandatory to visit. But if you're in Singapore, it's a must visit. You have to circle around the fountain certain times and wish for wealth. At least that's how the saying goes. You can watch the water display from 8am to 10pm daily. Daily touch water sessions are from 10am-12pm, 2pm-4pm and 6pm-730pm.

Close to Marina Bay, lots of shopping and food shops at the basement of the fountain and in adjoining buildings. Beautiful laser show at night, with soft music and peaceful atmosphere. Alive museum is just across the road."

,,"Beautiful fountain, especially at night",4.0,,"Very beautiful fountain, especially at night. Worth seeing if you pass by. Not far away from Marina Bay. We made it in a walking distance. Hop on hop off buses also go through it. Nice shopping area around, restaurants also."
,,Waiting for the wealth,4.0,,The question is will the wealth come to you . Check it out if you in the area . The hop on bus passes by this area too but would not make a special journey to visit .

But for some reason i like it and tend to bring visitors here - much to their bemusement

It all kicks off when the sun goes down with music and lasers - believe the first show starts at 8pm"
,,Cool spot,3.0,,Fun to see everybody doing the few rounds around the Fountain of Wealth to get wealthy. Had to do it myself of course as well.
,,something different in Singapore ... worth a visit for good luck maybe,4.0,,"If you've done the usual singapore things ... universal , garden by the bay and the parks ... you can try visit the fountain of wealth at the Suntec mall ... its off the beaten path but worth the visit especially at night ... at certain times you can try walking around the base three times and touch the water they say it can bring good luck ... at the very least it's a good and unique singapore photo op ... it was fun"
,,Nice fountain,4.0,,"Nice fountain with neat symbolism, but sort of off the beaten path. We saw it on the hop-on-hop-off bus, which was a waste of money, but at least we got to see this cool fountain."

,,Good location,3.0,,"This fountain is near a mall. You can take a taxi to Suntec and walk around the fountain. The concept is very simple, but somewhat elegant. This is not something you have to see in Singapore, but worth a glance if you are in the area."
,,Big,3.0,,"The Fountain of Wealth has size going for it, and the overall design of the buildings, fountain, etc. has meaning. Went during a weekend afternoon - not sure whether there is a better experience at night with the lighting."
,,Try to make a Wish at the Fountain of Wealth,4.0,,"There's no harm in trying and believing their tradition. They say that by doing a ritual here, you will granted a wish. So, if you are around Suntec City then be sure to visit the Fountain of Wealth.
Make sure to check the schedule, I think it's between 2PM to 4PM.

According to wiki The Fountain of Wealth is listed by the Guinness Book of Records in 1998 as the largest fountain in the world."
,,Worthwhile if your in the area,4.0,,"Worth a visit if your in the suntech city area, cool, refreshing a little fun for kids, teens. Very large structure, good luck to go in and walk around three times, only get slightly splashed but refreshing. No problems taking camera in and best of all ITS FREE! Only takes 5 minutes or so"
,,Wrong timing,3.0,,We specifically went to Suntec city just to touch this Fountain - they said they have a schedule bet 2-4pm i think where people can actually touch the water. Well we went there not knowing that it's under maintenance so they didnt run the fountain at all. Sad. I think its pretty large though cause it goes from the basement of Suntec City Mall up to the Rotunda outside the streets.
,,I hope it brings luck,3.0,,"Worth a look and to be honest the highlight of Suntec city although it is only a 5-10 minute stop for picture and the wealth fountain circling. Rennovations around spoil it a bit.

You will find it on the ground floor/basement and the water fountains around the main fountain are a nice touch"
,,Undergoing renovation,1.0,,Nothing to see! Sadly undergoing renovation so looking rather ugly. We didn't realise this until we arrived which of course was disappointing
,,Water Fountain and fine dining.,3.0,,"I walked to Suntec city using the subways from City Hall or Esplanade MRT to reach the waterfall. Looks nice both from outside or down below, where there are restaurants and food courts to watch, enjoy and sip while catching the view. Strangely, when I went outside, the Suntec Mall towers appeared grand and seem to mask the presence of the fountain. I would have liked to see an aerial view of the place to catch the art of engineering involved."
,,Have a look if you are at Suntec Mall.,3.0,,"We visited it for about 20 minutes while going for the Alive Museum. Its in the middle of the Suntec city mall. Its a very nice, amazing display and lighting, Its also a good photo taking place."
,,Hugh Fountain,5.0,,This is a hugh fountain. Very good to see. Better to view from above ie from the island as then you can see the size of the fountain better. It is hugh. Designed so that all the water runs down.
,,Fountain of wealth,5.0,,What a beautiful fountain and listening to the narrative on the tour gave us an insight into the the fountain with the surrounding buildings of suntec plaza . Definitely worth a visit
,,Another Singapore Tradition,4.0,,"The fountain, which is the largest fountain in the world, puts on an amazing display especially at night when the lights are on. Also during several periods throughout the day, the fountain is turned off and visitors are able to visit the base of the fountain, then following the Singaporean tradition placing your hands in the water while walking around the base 3 times will bring you wealth and good luck of their own. Very cool experience."
,,The largest fountain!,4.0,,Its very large and preety amazing. Good spot for some crazy pictures. just opposite the shopping mall.
,,Worlds largest,4.0,,We stayed at the Pan Pacific Hotel which is very close to the roundabout where the Fountain of Wealth is sited. It is the world’s largest fountain and can be seen from above (the road where the roundabout goes around it ) or at eye level from the mall. We managed to see the fountain at night which was very pretty
,,More beautiful at night,4.0,,Have visited this place twice both at day and night. It looked amazing at night however if you want to make a wish you should go at day time because the main entrance door is locked at night.
,,Just a fountain,3.0,,"Nothing special with this fountain, its just a fountain in the middle of mall. Around the fountain area there's many restaurant and food stall. Many people come here with hope can touch the water and their wishes come true. I just follow them touch the water and make three around the fountain. It will be more beautiful with light and color at night."
,,Somewhat disappointing,3.0,,"We arrived with high expectations, based on other reviews, and found the Fountain of Wealth to be rather underwhelming. This might have been the timing, though. We happened to arrive exactly when they shut the big circular fountain down for one hour so that visitors can walk inside to touch the small inner fountain (and wish for wealth). It was interesting at first to enjoy the changing lights on the small fountains and to watch people make this pilgrimage, and we might have tried it ourselves, except that there was a long line to get in. Watching became less fun after we saw a small boy with one group drop trousers and pee into the fountain.

Like everything else in Singapore, the Fountain is inside a mall, so there is mall-style food surrounding it."
,,Man-made,3.0,,"Anyway, was dining at suntec city and decided to drop by this area. They used to have laser shows here and one could actually dedicate songs here at the fountain but apparently, they removed it after the renovation. No laser works or such now. I proposed to my wife here about 6 years ago using the laser show and it was great. Of course, she said yes.

Anyway, tourists like to visit this place and there's actually a queue right outside the fountain for them to enter the fountain of wealth and walk round the small centre at the middle of the fountain. It is thought that it will bring good luck."
,,Just so so.,3.0,,It a normal kind of fountain. There saying to go around it and oray for success and health. Located inside the marina square. Its free.
,,more impressive by night,5.0,,"the fountain is located on the floor of the food court & the supermarket. there are specific hours when it's open to visitors & there are hours when it's fully operational - then one can watch only from the inside of the mall or from the street.
it's more impressive by night because it's illuminated.
they say it's the largest fountain in the world, but i wouldn't say it's the fanciest."
,,Horribly tacky,2.0,,"A big, ugly fountain. There is a lot of Feng Shui going on around this fountain. Check an aerial photo of Suntec City and you will see what I mean. It is meant to be sitting in the palm of a giant hand. The fingers are Suntec City's five skyscrapers which surround it. If you are superstitious maybe this will bring you wealth to your palm."
,,really interesting place but wishes don't work.,3.0,,Beautiful fountain hidden away in the shopping arcade... free to enter. We liked it! Walking around Singapore we came across thjis place on our way to the Raffles Hotel.... made an interesting walk.
,,Beautiful Fountain,4.0,,"Beautiful fountain, especially at night. You can walk to it and wash your hands in the magic water :-)."
,,It's ok but don't go out of your way,3.0,,"The Fountain of Wealth is certainly big, but don't go out of your way to find it. We went during the day but it's probably best to go at night for the light display.

Signage isn't the best once you get to Suntec City. Walk in through the office tower lobby, turn left and go to basement level. Then walk through the shopping centre and you'll find the fountain."
,,Nice light show at night,4.0,,"Ive been to this fountain several times and during different times of the day. I have seen it while it is has stopped working and while it is on. But what i like about it is during the light show at night, it transforms into a visual spectacle worth your time. The children loved the animals in the Chinese zodiac positioned around the fountain. Also it is in a mall where one can do a few other things."
,,Merchandizing opportunity,1.0,,Total load of rubbish and a waste of time. The idea is that you walk around it three times with your hands in the water to receive prosperity. The only people getting prosperous are the merchants and restaurateurs whose shops line the labyrinth of Suntec's basement that you must negotiate in order to reach the entry point.
,,not impressed with this fountain,2.0,,"seriously I do not have anything good to say about this fountain: - the place was strewn with litter - a few of the water pipes were not working so you got missing water/splash effect overall, there are better fountains around than this one..."
,,Average,3.0,,"For being the largest fountain in the world I was expecting it to be more spectacular. Walking towards it from street level it didn't look very big you have to go down stairs to see the full fountain. During certain times you can walk right in to the fountain when the top part is not on. We went in and in the very middles there is water shooting straight up and a little plaque that says to make a wish with your right arm in the water and walk around it 3 times. It is in a mall area with some retail restaurants and grocery store.

I would not come here just for the fountain but if you want to eat or something else check it out but don't think you missed something great is you miss this"
,,A bit of fun.,4.0,,"Suntec City Mall was built around the principles of feng shui and I read somewhere that Richard Branson had done this, so a quick wish whilst walking three times round the small fountain in the middle whilst touching the water was a bit of fun and you never know ..... The fountain is actually quite attractive when all the sychronised sprays get going and the Suntec mall is worth a visit for the coffee shops and restaurants alone."
,,Feels Like stood in middle of the earth,4.0,,"Located at the road circle roundabout 4 Suntec buildings (Esplanade or Promenade MRT exit;
You can reach them by using spiral staircase to the basement of all suntec buidling; Restaurants and shopping mall link loacted downstair. There a small fountain at middle of giant one people believes that if put hand walk rightward 3 times and make a wishe it will come true!!"
,,A biggest fountain in the world,3.0,,"I was guided that it is the biggest fountain in the world and the tour guide tried to get us get some water there for good luck.

Actually, it does not look good, unless it is the biggest fountain in the world! Seem to be very popular palace for Asian tourists.

Anyway, the palace is in the center of Singapore and very closed to Suntect city, a giant place for shopping."
,,Excellent architecture,5.0,,A unique style of fountain .. can relax at the coffee bars and food courts maintained around the fountain. Make sure that you visit during the entry hours so that you can touch the water and have a great scenic view
,,Colorful!,4.0,,"This is a beautiful fountain strategically placed between the 5 towers of suntec city. The structure and display is amazing.

There is also a wishing area where one can touch the water and wish something. As night falls, the fountain is lit up with multi colored lights which provides a beautiful sight to watch. Recommended!!"
,,A huge fountain with evening light display plenty of restaurants.,4.0,,"A huge fountain built as part of the Suntec development in the centre of the 5 buildings and road system. An impressive fountain with a light display at 1930hrs every night. You can walk out in to the middle of the fountain and walk around the centre for luck or enjoy one of many restaurants serving food all day on the lower ground floor enjoying the fountain while at breakfast, lunch or dinner. Worth a visit when visiting Singapore."
,,"Worth of visit, if you are near Suntec City",4.0,,"Like title says, worth of visit of you are in neighbourhood. Located downstairs of busy Suntec City Mall. They claim to be biggest in the world. Make sure you know when are the shows, because in our Lonely Planet guide book there wasn't any info of that."
,,Big fountain head,3.0,,"On one of my early trips to Singapore someone told me about a fountain, The Fountain of Wealth that they said was the world's largest.... I went there expecting to see a towering spray of water. Not so. In the middle of the road, I found a huge fountain head. The water is sprayed downwards into the core of the fountain, not upwards as most would expect. I wasn't too impressed.
I believe there's a lot of symbolism and Feng Shui involved in the design. In fact the whole Suntec City complex around it is designed so. The Exhibition Centre represents the wrist, the 5 office towers, 4 tall and one shorter represent the 4 fingers and thumb with the Fountain in the middle of what is designed around an upturned left hand.
I visited the fountain again last month, not to see the fountain itself but there are a whole lot of restaurants with seating around the fountain head, below the road level. This is a nice setting."
,,"If you're in the area, worth a look.",3.0,,"This is another such place:
1. Should you book your flight just to see this? Probably not.
2. If in the area, is it worth a look? Probably yes.

One can see from the photos attached to this review page, that the fountain takes on many aspects, depending on where one stands, and when (day or night, cloudy or sunny day, etc).

Suntec City is a shopping centre complex currently being renovated. It's a busy area. Travels, shopping, or other activity might bring you there. If so, it's worth checking this out.

Is this the ""world's largest fountain as promoted?"" Well, no. Yellowstone National Park, for example, is larger, more varied and fascinating. Is this the most interesting large fountain complex made by people? Again, IMHO, no. Visit Rome or Paris, maybe Manila, among other places, for more interesting fountains. Is this contrivance worth a visit? YMMV, but IMHO, yes."
,,Walk into the middle of the fountain,5.0,,"Visitors are allowed to walk into the fountain at certain times. The fountain is like the middle of our palm, the 5 surrounding towers are our 5 fingers. It's like holding wealth in our hands. That's why it's called the fountain of wealth. It's derived from the Chinese geomancy. Beautiful fountain!"
,,Try Your Fortune!,4.0,,"If you go to Suntec City Mall, don't forget to visit Fontain of Health. I visited Suntec City once, and now all I remember is Fountain of Health because of its uniqueness. I threw a coin into the pond, then I walked around the fountain while making wishes. Believe it or not, why not try it?"
,,Beautiful Fountain,4.0,,"It's written that this fountain is the biggest in the world. You can enjoy this place on the two different side. First, at the upper deck and second on lower ground. If the weather is good, i suggest to enjoy from the upper deck because the upper deck is open air and surrounded by skycrawler and garden. There are show for assorted time. So dont forget to check the time of show before you visiting this fountain."
,,Re-invented and vastly improved,4.0,,"i reviewed this before - and it was fairly dismal. However in true Singapore fashion, it has now
been re-invented after probably a year of disruption to the roundabout area. The fountain now is more dynamic and featuring a colourful range of effects. Better is that there is now a shopping complex around it below the road level, with places to eat and a good market is staying local. Still not spectacular, but a lot more fun and inviting."
,,worth a look,3.0,,"We visited the Suntec Shopping Mall Complex , and saw this Fountain of Wealth after dark its quite nice"
,,A nice addition to the Suntec Shopping Mall,3.0,,"We visited the Suntec Shopping Mall Complex a few months ago , and saw this Fountain of Wealth, at the beginning nothing special on this structure, but after dark its quite nice , complete with water and laser shows.We can go round the fountain and throw a coin , for good luck and prosperity.A nice addition to the Shopping Mall Complex , worth to see , and its free, can kill some of your time here."
,,Guinness World of record holder for the biggest fountain...but...,3.0,,"Good: -Looks expansive, but after a long look, you get bored of it. -Nothing nice to admire. Bad: -Suntec City is having renovations from Jan to July 2013. -Bad idea to view this metal structure as its uninteresting to the eyes."
,,Its unique and quite beautiful,3.0,,This place has been highlighted as guinness book achiever. Looks beautiful but to me its quite average. If you are passing from this place then only spend time on this otherwise it can be ignored
,,Great attraction,5.0,,"The fountain of wealth is definitely unique place. Whenever you come, please make a wish! Hope everything would be alright for what you wish for. Again, a recommended place too visit!"
,,Closed for renovation,3.0,,Walked for a while to go there and found that it closed for renovation. Cannot go inside!!. It will be available again around June so if you go before that period this can waste your time.
,,Disappointed,3.0,,Walked for miles to see this fountain of wealth in action nl to find that it was not working and lots of construction happening around it. What a shame :(
,,Worlds biggest fountain?,1.0,,"nothing spectacular really , more of fable that wealth come from touching the water........this feature is actually part of the basement of the suntec city mall."
,,The largest water fountain situated in the middle of a big shopping center.,5.0,,"The largest water fountain situated in the middle of a big shopping center. :)
Without a doubt the large water feature named as the fountain of wealth is on of the largest fengshui water fountains in Singapore.
The surrounding restaurants and cafes offers a delicious meal also a treated to the therapeutic sound of running water."
,,visual treat and what more?,3.0,,"One appreciates the architectural wonder especially if you are into fountains. You can make a wish too, but that's about it."
,,Come see the rain,3.0,,"If you're not into Feng Shui, its pointless to visit. The fountain is the palm of the hand that makes the building surround it the fingers. If you must see, make an excuse for lunch or dinner at the numerous eateries surrounding it."
,,Round and round,4.0,,Used to work around Suntec and would pass by Fountain of Wealth pretty often. Saw a group of excited tourists going round the water fountain and I found it quite cute. Worth the try to pop by if you're in Suntec for some high end shopping and good food. Might be boring to some of you but I think it's the fun of experiencing something different together that brings out the slight moment of fun and joy.
,,Good tourist spot. That is all,4.0,,It's a nice place to sit around and watch the show. Good place to bring foreigners cause who doesn't enjoy the superstition of gaining prospects for larger wealth?
,,Not as big as i hoped,3.0,,"In the heart of a busy roundabout ,the semi impressive fountain is drowned by the traffic,its o.k to pop and have a look when having a break from shopping. but not worth special trip."
,,Water Falling from A Ring,1.0,,Ridiculous idea - especially when I see a long long line of very bored people going round the water fountain to touch the water in hopes that it would bring them good fortune. Corny beyond belief.
,,"As of Nov 30 2012, it is down for repairs",3.0,,"I honestly think, even if it was working I would have given the same review. It's just a fountain with lights during the night. In comparison to other things in Singapore, this is nothing.

My recommendation, just have a taxi drive by it on the way to another destination, take your photo and knock it off your bucket list.

Personally, I would make it out of my way to visit again if I return to Singapore in the future."
,,make a wish wit people come from diffrent country ~,4.0,,"except water ,beautiful light effect ,delicate song program..it so romantic place to have a date here ..and go round to touch the water to make wishes to get wealth .. singaporean like to say 'HUAT AH'..~! i learn from them say loud ..HUAT AH ...(mean getting a lot of money )"
,,Big toilet bowl,1.0,,Not sure why this could be considered a tourist sight. It resembles a big toilet bowl with water flowing in.
,,Worth a look if you are passing,4.0,,"It's not the most beautiful fountain in the world but if you are in the area at night then it is well worth a look. Cool light show with lasers projected onto a curtain of water. Visit this before you see the Marina Bay light show,"
,,The Fountain of Wealth - the largest fountain in the world,3.0,,"The Fountain of Wealth is listed by the Guinness Book of Records in 1998 as the largest fountain in the world. It is located in Suntec City. I have been there a few times. You may walk along the fountain a few rounds to bring fortune to you.

Personally I do not think it is an excellent scenery. You may omit it if your schedule is tight."
,,Would probably be better to see at night.,2.0,,"Just across from Suntec City Mall.

The fountain was turned off every time I'd pass this in the daytime, so it was pretty drab. Looks like it could use some maintenance too. If I'm not mistaken, some paint was peeling off the circular structure at the top.

To be fair however, it might look better at night with the lights and water switched on. Maybe they switch it on in the evenings to save on operating costs - otherwise, it's just a big ugly eyesore during the day."
,,Biggest waste of time in the world,1.0,,"My room looks down on this - the biggest fountain in the world. if you lvoe fountains more tan your wife it may be interesting, and there's a light show at 8pm each night. Otherwise it's just water in the middle of a roundabout."
,,Still not sure...,2.0,,what is the big deal here? A monument of metal and concrete in the middle of a huge shopping complex that has seen better days? Walking around should bring the center ring should bring good luck...they say.....
,,Not impressed. At all.,2.0,,"Even when this gigantic fountain works, it simply fails to impress.
First of all, it's rather ugly, I'd say.
Secondly, there's not enough space to appreciate it, since it is surrounded by numerous hotels and other buildings.
They say it's the biggest fountain in the world. Whatever... . Who cares. :)
Bottom line - skip it."
,,know your chinese zodiac,4.0,,"Located outside suntec malls in suntec city, this fountain of wealth has the 12 chinese zodiac signs around the fountain. it is nice to watch especially at night for they become the center of attraction on this place."
,,Biggest fountain I've seen,5.0,,Our tuk tuk driver brought us here at night. It appeared to have a huge bronze ring as the fountain and was many stories high and going down under the street level we were on. It had an impressive laser light show. Worth seeing.
,,world's largest fountain.......,3.0,,"The structural design of the Fountain of Wealth has not been noticed quite well - some sort of it looks like a basketball hoop with four pillars. The compound of the fountain is not that well decorated, though - looks like a fountain built on an abandoned, open and cleaned warehouse. The entrance is also hard to find, but signs explain. All in all, if you have free time during your trip to Singapore and go to Suntec City, just try out the Fountain of Wealth. Its pointless, but good fun."
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"If you have nothing to do on a Sunday afternoon or otherwise, you can give it a visit. Its just a fountain, nothing really spectacular about it. It's beautifully lit at nights but that's just about it"
,,Fountain of Wealth,3.0,,"If you are superstitious, you will have to turn around the fountain 7 times to get a wish....It is near Suntec (exhibition hall, mall...to be honest it's not my favorite place in Singapore!!"
,,This is simply ridiculous,2.0,,I took some friends from out of town to this fountain. None of us became fabulously wealthy... I think the only people who are the collecting the admission Dont bother...
,,Not matching the hype!!,3.0,,It does not match the hype that professional photographs create about the fountain!! Its juts OK
,,Make a wish!,3.0,,"One of the first things I did when I moved to Singapore, and one of the first places I bring people at when they visit me. Don't forget to make a wish when you go around the fountain three times with your hands dipped in the water."
,,"Cool, fun thing to do & FREE!",4.0,,"The local custom is to walk around the fountain three times, while touching the water fountain and making a wish. Very cool to experience, when it's ""open"" for the opportunity. Otherwise, it's still a VERY cool fountain to see."
,,A multimedia water extravaganza,4.0,,"The Fountain of Wealth, truly the centre of attraction at Suntec City Mall, has apparently been listed in the Guinness Book of Records in 1998 as the largest fountain in the world. Now, that by itself should command attention. However if you're still not impressed, here are more facts about this striking water attraction:

1. The water in this fountain flows INWARD - we understand that apart from water being the symbol of life and wealth in Chinese culture, the inward flow symbolises riches pouring in!

2. The five towers of the Suntec City Mall are designed to symbolize the five fingers of the left hand - the 'ring' of the fountain sitting in the middle of the 'palm' symbolizes (you guessed it!) wealth!

3. The fountain's circular ring is supported by four large slanted columns that give it a kind of dramatic visual impact rarely seen in fountains.

4. As travellers of Indian origin, we are gratified to note that the fountain is based on the Hindu 'mandala' or universe, and symbolizes the oneness of spirit, the harmony and unity of multi-racial Singapore - now that is a truly beautiful thought...

SUGGESTIONS:

1. While the fountain is operational from 9am through 10pm daily, it is truly at its best - when it is nothing sort of a multimedia water extravaganza with laser beams, music and fine misty spray - only after 6pm...so try and be there around then.

2. There are three laser shows (where laser breams are projected onto the misty spray from the fountain with accompanying background music) which happen every day at 8pm, 8.30pm and 9pm. These are well worth seeing and so recommended.

3. We were told that since it is considered a symbol of hope and good luck there are many who come to touch the fountain waters to take in the positive ""qi"" . These ""touch water"" sessions happen pretty much throughout the day except between 12pm-2pm, 6pm-7pm and 8pm-9.30pm

4. The other major highlight (now this can really impress your significant other I should think!!) at the fountain is Song Dedications that can be done between 8pm - 9.30pm on all days of the week. A little more dramatic are the Laser Message Dedications which can be done 8pm - 9.30pm but only on Friday through Sunday.

5. Don't miss the refreshing, soothing Koi pond at Basement 1 in the Tropics Zone of Suntec Mall. Fish feed is available for SG$2 per packet, and it is almost therapeutic to feed the colourful fish to the music of water flowing softly in the background."
,,Average,3.0,,Nothing much except for the fact that theres laser show at night and one can dedicate songs during a time period each day...
,,biggest man made water fountain apparently,4.0,,nice place with restaurants around. you can do visual and music dedications as well
,,Walk around the water,4.0,,"Clockwise or counterclockwise, a must if you believe!"
,,Nothing special,2.0,,"It may be the world's biggest fountain but it was sure a disappointment!
Firstly they don't even switch the fountain on until 6pm, so don't go before then as Suntec City Mall isn't work wondering around in. When it was switched on, it was impressive but it's definitely not as amazing as they make it sound. You can also touch the water for good luck, but again they only allow this at certain times.
They have a laser show three times in the evenings (updated timings on the website and posters around the fountain), but please please do not stay for this or go to this. It is the biggest waste of time ever. To call it a fountain and laser show is an embarrassment, and I could tell that I wasn't the only one who thought it was bad because most people had left before it finished. if you really want to see a water/light/laser show go to see the free one at Marina Bays Sands, or the free or paid ones at Sentosa.
Only go to this if you have lots of spare time or are staying around the area, and even then do not stay for their ""show"".

TIP: The closest MRT is Promenade on the Circle Line. The fountain is in the middle of a roundabout, so to access it you must go through Suntec City Mall and follow the signs to the basement. After this, for the best view climb up the stairs."
,,World Largest Fountain,3.0,,"This fountain would not rate highly in the beauty ratings, its not the most attractive fountain, especially when its not operating. The presence of water adds something to the experience, but apart from the size, there is not much really going for it.Of all the times I have been to the fountain, it seems to be operating rarely. Maybe its a water saving measure, to power saving, I dont know."
,,Average show,3.0,,The fountain laser display starts at 8pm. Many couples around the vicinity and someone tried proposing on this. Outdoors and quite humid to be standing around watching the show.
,,Don't really see the attraction,3.0,,"OK maybe I'm a local so I really don't see the thrill or attractiveness of this place but alot of tourists seem to like it enough to queue for it sometimes. Maybe they've never seen or experienced something like this before and for the Chinese, this water represents luck or fortune so they want to have a go at it. I guess OK for a first timer."
,,Nothing very interesting,2.0,,Tourist trap in the middle of Suntec City - no real attraction
,, Largest fountain in The World,4.0,,"located at Suntec city largest fountain of the world with a height of 13.8m.
Some times the fountain is turned off and people can walk around the mini fountain at the center base
walk around 3 times make a silent wish all while holding you arm touching the water

Esplanade MRT stop on Circle line is a easy way to go to Suntec City"
,,Don't understand what's the big deal,2.0,,It may be the world's largest fountain of its kind and there is this fancy laser-light show and there is this local superstition that you gain wealth by walking around the centre of the Fountain....but I still don't understand the draw. Maybe it is just me.
,,rusty looking copper pipes,1.0,,"Face it, this is dismally old. I used to work at Suntec City when it was the ""vertical silicon valley"" of Singapore - that was 2000-2004. These days, it just looks a bit shabby.... and with many office tenants having left, there is nothing of good fortune is there?"
,,fountain of wealth,4.0,,the lighting is superb and the place exudes its own charm during the day . Personally a lot of my financial problems have been solved : but then its a matter of beleiving
,,A man made wonder,4.0,,its really great seeing this...the wonders of what men can create
,,excellant,5.0,,"excellant laser show... we always visited during xmas , chinese new yr time ..."
,,Innovation,4.0,,"Water is important in Chinese culture. This is fountain is Singapore's water icon, like the Water Jet in Geneva. Very nice. Pulls in the crowd, amazing to watch so much water flow down there. The eatouts at the bottom of Suntec offer a good view of the flow when you are dining."
,,"Beautiful, breathtaking",3.0,,"Beautiful especially in the evening. Different colors -- colors changes from time to time...you can even make a wish.... once your wish is granted, you have to return and visit and give thanks."
,,What's so spectauclar about it?,2.0,,"If you go in the daytime like I did, there is really nothing to see. Just a big metal circle supported by, erm, how many was that, 4 poles? And the saying that ""if you walk round it 3 times, you will get wealth"" is just pure rubbish. Period."
,,made for the tourist,3.0,,"""myth"" has it that you make rounds around the fountain and it will bring you good fortune. Of course, ""myth"" comes with a price tag."
,,Underwhelming,2.0,,Ok there was a fountain with dancing water and lights. AND...?
,,Yawn,3.0,,Not very breath-taking. I find the design tasteless.
,,If you are in the area,3.0,,"If you are shopping at Suntec city, it's worth stopping by for a look, but I wasn't that impressed. I went during the day and I've been told it is better to visit at night. I'm not sure. The buildings surrounding the fountain were interesting though, reflecting the influence of Feng Shui on the city's architecture. There are five buildings designed to look like the left hand with the fountain in the palm. Interesting, but most of the buildings in Singapore have some quirk to them."
,,A giant gas ring,3.0,,This sounds interesting - the largest fountain in the world - but it's just so-so. I wouldn't bother making a special trip to see if but if you wandering past of an evening then stop by for a look

,,Pretty and Unusual,5.0,,If you have the chance - go visit this fountain. Very pretty and unique.
,,A bit fountain best seen at night...,3.0,,"When the attraction is not running for the show, you can go down and walk three times around the fountain for good luck.... You cannot miss this if you go downtown near Suntec..."
,,Dated attraction...,3.0,,"With the opening the Marina Bay Sands with its nightly light & sounds display just minutes walk away...this attraction is somewhat dated...quite entertaining for the 1st timers , being world's biggest fountain. But the novelty wears off pretty fast...it's free, so just catch it as part of the Marina Bay experience..."
,,"Good Feng Shui? Maybe, but not pretty.",3.0,,"When I read in the guidebook about the 'mystical powers' of the Fountain of wealth (put your hand in the water and make a wish, walk around three times and your wish will come true) I was intigued. When I got there I was a little disappointed. It's still a nice thing to do, but the fountain is very functional and not as ornate as I would have imagined."
,,Waste of time,1.0,,Went here in Dec 2011. Just a fountain in a mall. Nothing to write home about.
,,Lucky fountain,5.0,,"Make your wish and go around the fountain 3 times. This simple task never seems to bring calm to my usually hectic mood and at the end of it, I feel relaxed and my mind is at ease.

Not sure why the others are complaining about this fountain but then again, there are no charges to go into the fountain or to watch the light show. Free entertainment + managed expectations = 5 stars from me."
,,Gain some good luck in your trip!!!,4.0,,"Entering the roundabout and following the instructions, in which I place my hand under falling water and make a wish, I felt carefree and open. It may be a simple and uninteresting task, but somehow it lightens the soul and opens one's mind. The water that spalshes on one's hand may be cold, but a dose of warmth is kept inside which actually enlightens you up.

Indeed, it may be pointless. ""But its free, so its okay if its pointless!"" It isn't about the money, although I appreciate the fact that it is free, but is about simply making a wish, motivating oneself that makes the whole trip to the fountain worthwhile. And even though it may not come true, it was fun hoping. For me, as a youth, it technically has no meaning but fun. But for an adult, it could be a source of encouragement.

as a family we had a fun time becoz we were all together and got a chance to regroup ourselves. during a trip one must expect such family time and such is the perfect place to do so.
All in all, if you have free time during your trip to Singapore and go to Suntec City, just try out the Fountain of Wealth. Its pointless, but good fun."
,,"May be short, but still enjoyable.",4.0,,"Half of my trips to Suntec City Mall would usually include paying a visit to the world's largest fountain, the Fountain of Wealth. It is said that the owners of Suntec City were wealthy, and shared their wealth through the fountain.

The structural design of the Fountain of Wealth has not been noticed quite well - some sort of it looks like a basketball hoop with four pillars. The compound of the fountain is not that well decorated, though - looks like a fountain built on an abandoned, open and cleaned warehouse. The entrance is also hard to find, but signs explain.

Despite these flaws, I still enjoyed the fountain. Entering the roundabout and following the instructions in which I place my hand under falling water and make a wish, I felt carefree and open. It may be a simple and uninteresting task, but somehow it lightens the soul and opens one's mind. The water that spalshes on one's hand may be cold, but a dose of warmth is kept inside.

,,World's largest fountain!,3.0,,"Yes, this is the world's largest fountain. Very popular for it's unique structure and design, this fountain also makes wishes come true. Designed as per the Chinese art, the water in the fountain falls from top to bottom rather than the other way round."
,,A really big fountain!!!,4.0,,"Let's grab a touch of reality - this is something big to check out at a shopping mall.
It is the world's biggest fountain and when you approach from ground level it is pretty big, then you see that it actually starts from below ground you get an idea of how huge this is.
The show in the evening is a free thing and while I wouldn't race in a taxi to get there just to see it again, if you are going to Suntec City in the evening go and check it out. Maybe do it before the Sentosa Fountains if you are going there too.
Putting this in perspective, I will be in Singapore with my family (young kids) next month and shopping, dinner and the fountain will be on the itinerary for an evening's activities."
,,Make a wish here,4.0,,Huge mall with fountain of wealth. Make a wish while touch the water.
,,What a disapointment!,1.0,,"During the day the main part of the fountain (the big ring) isn't running - you can go out and put your hand in the little center section and walk around for luck. The night light show they talk about is pathetic. A few colored lights and the laser is used mainly to write dedications that noone else cares about. Don't waste your time with that.

Particularly after the fountain show on Sentosa I was expecting something better. This was the biggest disappointment in the whole country."
