,,Full of activities and food,4.0,,"A place where you can get fresh air, cool breeze, lots of sun, greens, sands, long beach and very clean. You can jog, run, skate, cycle, flying kite, canoe, cable skiing, picnic, barbecue etc at this place. That is how huge and long the whole East Coast Park. You can spend the whole day here. There are many cafes, restaurants and fast food. If you are on budget or want to try the true blue local cuisine, dine at the East Coast food centre. Over there, food is cheaper, more varieties and delicious too. It sells all kinds of local cuisine. And the stalls open day and night. One reminder for tourists --- if you want to buy BBQ seafood at the stalls, ask and confirm for the price first before ordering."
,,Rent a bike and take a ride!,5.0,,"As other reviewers have said, the park is huge and has lots of things to see and do.

We rented bikes for 3 hours from the rental house in area B then rode all the way up to F and back. made stops at the hawker center to grab a snack and a beer, stopped to watch the wakeboarders in the lagoon, and later the skateboarders and scooter riders at the skatepark. on the way back hit the McDonalds for ice cream and stopped at playground next door to keep the kids happy.

Overall a great way to spend the afternoon and see a different, more relaxed, and breezier side of Singapore."
,,Beach park...fun...,5.0,,"Along the 15 km stretch of beach , you will find cyclists enjoying sea breeze. Cable skiing and water sports are for fun"
,,The City Beach!,5.0,,"City beach. The city’s most popular beach always is full with activities at all kinds – BBQ, overnight in a tent, and other sports. In total a wide spectrum of sporting events that you can see and/or participate, like the Singapore Marathon, just today the Singapore Triathlon and other Xtreme Championship."
,,GET COOL AND FRESH AIR,4.0,,"An open air space for Morning Walk, Jogging, Evening Walk, Cycling, Roller Skating and all sorts of fun activities. We visit quite often, last being on 18th July 2019. The sea-breeze is really refreshing"
,,Sea view,5.0,,Nice and beautiful view and air It was first time visiting here I really liked this place Can running and cycling and walking around I enjoy love to visit again
,,What to do ! This is all what we have !,5.0,,"cycle to the end of the TOP of East Coast and hit the beaches where the pine trees are ... bring your own trash bag and clear whatever spot
That you are sitting around .. with such hot weather in July and August
This is the best place to chill .. try to teach your kids to stay quiet .. the upper beaches are more for the tranquil sorts ... hush
Though I was astounded last week when I saw the grass cutter chopping up the styrofoam white boxes that were left by the fishing enthusiasts or whatever that was left ashore and gotten blown towards the green areas .. I manage to hail a nice lady who works for N Parks who promise me the park squeaky for National Day .. the other beaches are best reached by boat .. sisters island and by car Tanjung Rhu .. Singapore beaches have improved tremendously though I must say as a child it was more natural where Singapore’s airport is now located we had the most incredible beach in the old days .... gone gone gone .. by the way I love the beach on Sentosa .. go hunt Tanjung Rhu on Sentosa island
The waters are not as nice and clear especially high tide as the upper reaches of the East Coast where the pine trees are grown and if you see the grass cutter chopping up these styrofoam boxes on the grass please tell him not to ! # national Parks of Singapore please take note"
,,my favourite park in singapore,5.0,,"East Coast has always been my favourite place to cycle in Singapore.

Love the fact it's not on a road and you can go all the way from Marina Barrage to Changi Village and back

Nice atmosphere here too with lots of restaurants and bars here

Just a great place to visit."
,,East coast food centre,5.0,,I frequent east coast food centre weekly. Enjoy good and reasonably price local food. Free sitting open air facing the sea. Good range of good price beers
,,Nice park,4.0,,Nice relaxing park with restaurants and shops near by. I enjoyed my time here and found it relaxing.
,,My Kids Loved it,5.0,,"This place is not a priority for a lot of tourists but if you have Children and have some time to spare this is a low budget Paradise for families. Unfortunately there is no MRT station nearby so you have to take the bus from one the MRT stops nearby or a taxi. There is no entrance fee this is a huge public park situated along the shore with beautiful clean beaches. We were lucky the day we went was cloudy so we spent the whole day here. Marine Cove Playground was the highlight for the kids which is a huge open play space with slides and small obstacle for the kids. The beaches here are so peaceful we went on a weekday so it wasn't busy at all the kids loved playing and running free on the beach. A lot of locals come here for Barbeques and Camping. There are running tracks and cycling tracks you can rent bikes ride around. There are many places to eat there's a Hawker Centre some very Famous Seafood Restaurants and also fast food places. The park is Beautiful, Clean and just unique definitely worth a trip with kids."
,,Fantastic oasis in this busy city,5.0,,"ECP was not the sort of attraction we would have covered as mere tourists. But we were lucky to have local friends with inside knowledge who took us first thing to ECP on our 8 day trip to Singapore. The park has a bit of everything, a pristine stretch of beach, walking and cycling tracks, open air bar-be-ques and restaurants. We hired cycles and traversed up and down the length of this park, tiring but mighty fun. There is a hawker center, a pub and stand alone sea-food restaurants scattered in various parts."
,,Great park!,4.0,,"Visited the seafood centre and there were many restaurants to visit. Ended up eating at the Jumbo restaurant. Took a walk after our dinner, there were local folks having a picnic near the sea overlooking the ships and its lights. There was a local hawker stall food centre nearby offering many local dishes such as noodles and satay. There are toilets located all around too, although there are not the cleanest."
,,Locals dinner,3.0,,As our friends live in Singapore they took us here for dinner. We went to the hawker section so much choice and prices very competitive. I lost count of all that we ate it was all very tasty . Please go and enjoy get a table first then go and explore. Afterwards we walked to the end of the jetty good way to finish .
,,Beach Park,5.0,,"Park has chalets , food centres and amenities for various activities. People can do fishing here. Cycling track also available."
,,Nice area and there's a parkrun on Saturday mornings,4.0,,"Nice area for a walk, run or bike ride. There's good flat shared paths and if you're registered with Parkrun there is a parkrun here every Saturday at 7.30am. Make sure to take water as there are no water drinking facilities, hence 4 stars instead of 5"
,,Pleasant area,4.0,,Thought we would check out the beach in Singapore so took public transport from our hotel near Little India. Fairly easy to navigate once we got the hang of the buses. Popular spot with hiring of bikes available. Great to see the diversity of people using the space and the view of shops was interesting.
,,Lovely place specially for jogging,4.0,,"Lovely Long beach and offer multiple options .. eating, running, Cycling, Swimming etc Nice food options"
,,Beach at Night,4.0,,"Fantastic long stretch of beach for strolling, jogging and enjoying seabreeze. Popular area for couples, friends and families enjoying picnics, bbq, glamping. Sometimes u see outdoor movie screen put up too. Safe at night. Lots of outlets to buy food and drinks (may not be cheap but enough options like hawker centre, food and bicycle kiosks, cafes, fastfood, restaurants) but where else can you stroll at 9pm on Saturday night safely in the world, especially along a beach. Not encouraging swimming, not that kind of beach facilities."
,,Lovely afternoon,4.0,,"We visited on a week day and there were very few people about. The place was peaceful and relaxing. Hot on the beach, but lots of shade under the trees behind. Amazing to see so many ships at sea. Only a few food places open mid week. Imagine it is crowded at the weekend. A walking and cycle path along the coast."
,,Great Park,5.0,,"Just spent a lovely day at East Coast Park. So much to see and do. You can’t visit without trying out the Hawkers food. There weren’t a lot open at lunchtime, but the food we found and has freshly cooked was scrummy. Great value too. Take a walk along the beach or grassed areas or hire a bike. Our children enjoyed wake boarding while the adults chilled with a drink at a bar. The only challenge to the day was getting a taxi back to the hotel. Hardly any around in the day. Great day though."
,,Some chill out therapy,4.0,,"We had a bit of time on our hands and decided to go to East Coast Park on the advice of a friend. We took a cab (they are so cheap in Singapore) .. it's on the road to Changi Airport.

The cabbie took us to where there were some hawker food stalls and heaps of places to sit. There are undercover tables and chairs all over the place.

First things first, we ordered a bucket full of ice and bottles of beer and then, one by one (there were four of us) we would each go to a food stall and come back with a plate of heaven ... there are different cuisines, Malaysian, Cantonese, Singaporean .. pork, steak, noodles, seafood ... you name it, they had it.

As we were eating and drinking, we were taking in the surrounds and the people .. so relaxing .. there was a Chinese guy, he would have been at least 80, bald on top with the hair on the sides of his head reaching his shoulders, 8 inch beard ... and he was in full Lycra riding a cool road bike ... this is a favourite place for cyclist going by the number there.

The view from the beach was a bit industrial with countless tankers and container ships moored offshore but the water looked nice and relaxing.

There was a tow skiing place just down the beach and a bit of a fun park with restaurants and other amenities.

Overall we enjoyed our day in the park and will certainly go back the next time we are in Singapore .. so find a cab and go there and just veg out for a day."
,,5 stars if you wanna cycle,5.0,,"I love cycling on this route, it's so windy, roads are wide enough for cyclists! Such a relaxing spot. I cycled numerous times from Marina Bay Sands all the way to ECP and onwards to Changi Village for nasi lemak. Roads are well connected and safe. Very memorable ride indeed."
,,Natural Sanctuary amidst a bustling city,5.0,,"ECP is a place that can mean different for different people. It is a haven for cyclists, runners, skate boarders and also a leisure resort for families to enjoy food and beach and can also be an unique destination for photographers"
,,Usual Park,3.0,,"This place is Ok for a walk or bike ride. The food village is fine. Personnally a bit dissappointed by the place, as I thought it would be something a bit more special, but it's just a usual park."
,,Wonderful place to chill out,5.0,,"To be precise, this is not a spot in itself but is a stretch along the east coast of Singapore.

If you have the time, you should explore running, walking or cycling along this stretch along the beach. Be rest assured that you are not alone as many locals and foreigners enjoy coming here for the sun, sand and sea.

If you are wondering where to start, then I would suggest that you begin your day of outdoor fun where the McDonald's is located.

Around that area, you will be able to rent bicycles, roller blades, and even canoes. If you feel like having a BBQ, you can also rent a pit along the beach. Do note that prevailing or pits is required and you can do so through the Singapore National Parks website.

Make sure you come in comfortable gear to enjoy this wonderful outdoor place."
,,Singapore's largest park- and one can swim or camp!!,4.0,,"This Park has a very interesting background, inasmuch as it is very large and built completely on ""reclaimed land and beaches (where one can swim)"". The Park also has a 15 kilometre long cycling and ""in line skating"" track (where bicycles and skates can be rented). The track also connects to several other very enjoyable Parks! For those who love camping--- there are facilities provided (and one must buy a permit). The park also features wonderful Singaporean ""Street Food"" located in a Food Court. There are also many scenic places for picnicking! TripAdvisor has awarded it the ""Certificate of Excellence"". This a most interesting and memorable place to visit--- and it offers another perspective/ side to Singapore's many excellent attractions.

I hope that this Review has been helpful."
,,Fantastic area to walk,5.0,,"This is a very long stretch of beach which extends from the Barrage almost to Changi. A beautiful green strip with playgrounds, grass, jogging and walking tracks that is not particularly easy to get to unless you have a car. Access to bus/MRT is not particularly easy. However it is rarely crowded during the week, a peaceful place to relax. There are numerous places to eat and drink along the way. The beach is surprisingly clean and the water is calm so there is no issue for swimming with kids. I don't think many tourists come here, as most of the people we saw were locals, and some school groups. Definitely worth spending some time here if you love nature."
,,East Coast Parkway,5.0,,"East Coast Parkway. A good stretch of beach for outdoor activities for the whole family.
You'll find joggers, cyclists & roller bladders enjoying the sun and sea breeze.

Also no shortage of food, drinks & restaurants along this stretch. Families often hold picnics & gatherings here to let their children have fun & play with the sand."
,,Good quiet place,4.0,,Good place to enjoy an evening breeze. Nice clean area with lots of food stall. Can enjoy an evening walk at park.
,,Nice place to spend sunset,4.0,,"We went here on Christmas Eve and suprisingly found it to be free from holiday crowds. A long stretch of beach which extends right till Changi Airport, it has a nice running/ walking trek. The sea is crowded with ships ( Singapore being a busy port) so those who go to sea for staring into infinity, might find it slightly dissappointing. Like the people of Singapore, the sea here is also well disciplined with no rough wave coming to the beach. The water was moving in unison. It really turns beautiful during sunset with countless hues of blue and red. A sight to behold. It's connectivity to MRT isn't that great though. So if you are in downtown, the best way to reach here would be a cab."
,,Clean and green park for all to enjoy,4.0,,"East Coast Park is very well maintained and is a place for all ages, young and old. There is cycling, wakeboarding, barbecue, chalets and many other activities available for all to have fun."
,,Crabs by the Seaside,5.0,,"One of the best things to do in Singapore as the year ends is to eat crabs by the seaside.
The East Coast has lots of lovely restaurants. We went at 6.30 pm - perfect for catching the last of the sun as it set.
Sit outdoors under the sky if you can - getting a stiff sea breeze is the main course in my books.
We went to the reliable Jumbo Seafood where one crab is a hair-raising $88. But everything else is well-priced, and simply but competently made, with lots of wok hei. (“Breath of the stoves” which you only get from the high temperatures of an industrial kitchen)

A good choice for a great evening out"
,,Huge and well maintained seas-side park. Great food options. Lovely walk/run/cycling path,4.0,,"This is probably Singapore's best known park for citizens. Every evening its buzzing with all types of activiity

On the day we went, there was a sand castle building event by the sea. Some extraordinary art was on display. The waters are choppy and not great for bathing, but worth a dip. It also seems to be a great place for fishing, from what we saw

I couldnt help myself and had a good run along the great pedestrian track. The kids did some skating. I also saw some bays meant for barbeque parties, which seems like a great idea.

Jumbo Seafood has a sea-facing restauarant here and naturally it was abuzz with people. There is also a food court area that serves superb grilled stuff thats much more affordable. They specialise in satays, with rows and rows of shops offering this, and other grilled meat/finger food. Its tough to find a seat though."
,,Great for Picnic,4.0,,Tons of places to sit and enjoy view. Great sea breeze and lots of places to eat. Bring a blanket to sit on grass. Rent a bicycle if possible and enjoy riding across the coast. There is even a food court with cheap foods.
,,Great location for exercise,4.0,,"One of the few beachfront parks to enjoy. Nice location, great for a walk or jog along the beach and grassy area. Bring a picnick lunch on the weekend and enjoy the outdoors."
,,Fun with bikes!,5.0,,"Quite convienent walk distance from katong area. Its a front beach park, with many trees, barbecue stations, nice ciclovia with rental bikes. We rent two bikes for around SGD24 , for 1 hour. Lots of fun for my kid. I guess weekends it gets more croweded but still fun!"
,,Good for exercise or relaxation,3.0,,"A nice place for jogging, cycling or just relaxing by the beach. You can reach it on foot or by bike through the park connector network."
,,Nice park,4.0,,"This is a great place for jogging, cycling, roller blading and similar activities. There are many barbecue pits as well (which need to be booked) and it is a good place for a gathering with friends and family."
,,"The Sea, Sand, Trees, and Skies!",5.0,,"Most tourists don't see this side of Singapore at East Coast Park. If you have enough of city glitz and glam shopping malls, this well-maintained park is a great breather to stretch yourself along the very east breezy coasts of the island. This accessible park open for public is for families, couples, big groups, dogs, bikers, joggers, nature lovers, fishers, and makan (eat) seafood enthusiasts.

Very well maintained and no two trips are the same. Pleasant surprise for anyone who doesnt believe Singapore has a beach too."
,,East coast park,4.0,,"Hey guys, visites the east coast park with my family few ago. Perfect evening get away. Nice beach there beach lovers. A nice garden including a play area for kids. All age groups of people seen there. Also saw a srarbucks and a indian & mexican restaurant where we had dinner."
,,Fun on a Bike,4.0,,"We walked here from Orchard/Somerset to meet friends who live on the East Coast and together we all went cycling on hire bikes. I am not a cyclist and I am not confident on a bike near traffic so for me it was a great afternoon. No traffic, no complicated road junctions, just plain cycling, I really enjoyed it. We lunched at small food market by the beach where the food was very good. That night we walked back to 313 Somerset along the Highway and over the bridge crossing the Gaylang River, in the dark the walk back was wonderful with great views of the Marina Bay area from vantage point of the bridge."
,,Great place for exercise with a view,5.0,,"This park stretches about 10km along the sea-side and has several rest areas, vending machines, bicycle rental shops and some restaurants along the way. Best way to experience it is to rent a bike and ride along the paths. A great way to get some exercise while exploring the area and taking in the sea views."
,,Can visit this place any time of the day or Night,4.0,,"Always buzzing with people, East Coast Park is a good place for visiting day or night.You can hire cycles or bring you own as well for riding in the park.Nice views of the sea.Lots of good options for seafood as well."
,,Parkrun,5.0,,"I ventured over for a parkrun and found the location really easily. The run itself was nice.

The problem I had afterwards was getting a taxi back. In the end I decided to jog all the way along the track to the river, and then call a taxi from there (the reception to the gardens, I think it was)"
,,East Coast Park,4.0,,"The park is very big, there are parts of it in which you can enjoy the contact with nature but other parts are perhaps too crowded with cyclist and other people on skates and other electric transportation devices. However it worths the visit and you most surely will enjoy the day"
,,A must visit in Singapore - 14 kms of non-stop cycling and entertainment.,5.0,,"Singapore is a garden city, or rather a park city with several large parks all over Singapore. Government of Singapore decided to join all the parks with 'connectors' so one can ride a cycle all round the island through all the parks and return to the same point.
East Coast Park is 14-km long on the ocean between Changi Airport and Financial District. One can cycle without worrying for any traffic, within the park on a cycling track which is different from several walking paths. And all this on a eye-pleasing ocean front.
One can rent bicycles, family cycles, skate wheels, skate boards, kids cars and much more from the many shops all over the 14 km track.
There are several ponds and forest areas. The entire park is shrouded in trees.
There are sand areas to swim or for children to play and build sand castles.
There are play areas for children.
There are several break-out areas for entertainment.
Famous Jumbo Sea Food as well as many eateries dot 14 km stretch. Visit to Jumbo sea food is a must.
The famous ECP hawker centre is also in the precincts of East Coast Park.
a must visit to unwind or the exercise or to walk/cycle before a well-deserved meal at one of the famous restaurants."
,,Depends on the timing; avoid weekends,4.0,,"Preferably, an off-peak visit is really pleasant. In the mid-morning, on a weekday, this is a pleasant spot for rollerblading and running. Not so much on weekends, unless you have a fetish for being knocked over by cyclists on walking path and vice versa. Stay in your lanes people!"
,,Well maintenaned coast,4.0,,"Had a wonderful time there and a great food stalls where you can enjoy various BBQs , delicacies . You need be there early when in weekends as it gets fully packed."
,,Quieter western stretch of a perennially busy East Coast Park,5.0,,"East Coast Park (ECP) is hardly an ""undiscovered"" part of Singapore, as you will find out if you come here at most times of the day. The separate cycle and walking paths are filled with people of all shapes and sizes, enjoying the brisk sea breezes (and blistering heat). But come in the early morning (around 630 am), just as dawn breaks, and it is peaceful solitude, broken only by awakening campers, birds, the occasional hard-core cyclist and squirrels. We recently discovered the western part of ECP, which skirts the National Service Resort, Sea Sports centre and golf course. This well maintained cycle/walkway meaders through the coast line, with some lovely treescapes. You are in the line of the Changi airport runway, so you will be serenaded by the occasional A320 taking off, but other than that, it is a really pleasant and accessible early morning exercise spot. We terminated at Tanah Merah Coast Road, I suspect the cycleway becomes a lot more open and unrewarding after that. 8 km return journey."
,,East Coast Park - Singapore,5.0,,"East Coast Park - a wonderful coastal line and leisure for family and friends. Good designed trail and facility provided for all kinds of activities from run, cyclist to water sports and BBQ set, cafe to Restaurant. Beautiful scenes along the way !!"
,,East coast park Singapore,4.0,,"One place for any age group to unwind !! Its a large park ideal for a picnic. There is a play area for the kids @marine cove close to parking area C2/C3. Attractions include cycling that you can hire for an hour upwards, ranging between SGD 6/- to 60/- per hour depending on the kind of cycle you choose including family bike, double seat bike etc.. helmets (though not compulsory) can be hired too at a reasonable price. There is long cycling track to ride at an easy pace along the east coast park stretch. Some of the Other activities I witnessed include skating, roller blades, skiing, foot volley, beach volley ball, beach games, skateboard, pitch a tent, kayaking, remote controlled jeep racing, kite flying, barbecue, water skiing etc. The other basic amenities such as food courts, wash area, toilets etc. are available too. Take your picnic hamper and mat in case all you need is to laze along the beach side to enjoy sun and sand !!"
,,Nice to Run the pathway - ParkRun event by Parkrun Singapore,5.0,,"I have made this a go to place on stop overs going back to Sydney.
I attend the Singapore Park Run that starts at 7.30am, then after sweating it up..i walk to the local Starbucks for a Coffee and a snack, either the pre-packed yoghurt or ham and cheese brioche roll.
service is quick and efficient, and this is the place if you need a taxi back to your hotel. even though this time i walked a fair bit down the road until i could hail a free one -trip back is about $9. Going to carpark B1 in the morning where the park run starts is about the same."
,,Best public recreational parks for everyone and anyone!,5.0,,"Most underrated spots to visit in Singapore. Weather you are a local or tourist, athletic or looking for leisure walk-around, you can always find something to do in this mile-long recreational park with unlimited views to watch magnificent sunrise/sunset with mega ships. Running, strolling, skateboarding, bilking, wind-surfing, swimming, you name it! Kids and pets friendly too. Recommend to come in the afternoon. There is also a decent food center nearby and a lot of restaurants by the sea."
,,Kebab,4.0,,Nice place but unfortunately it started to rain there so we had to leave early. I would like to go there once again.
,,East Coast Park Singapore,3.0,,"Used to bring my kids here during the weekends in the eighties where children can have a good play on the sand... But nowadays it is too crowded with bikers, roller skaters and groups of foreign workers having their picnics..."
,,Sunrise and sunset great fore shore walking jogging excercise,4.0,,"Nice safe area to Ride,walking or jogging. Beautiful sunrise and sunset. Loved the kids parks and play areas. Take fluid to stay hydrated. Coffee shops and cafes are located so was good to take a break for some coffee and snacks."
,,Relaxation with Sea View,5.0,,"The east coast park has been upgraded now and then. First with chalets and bbq pits, now with walkways and cycling paths.

I been cycling along east coast for a couple of years, not getting bored of the scenery. You see different happenings, scenery and people at different times of day.

Good place for family get together."
,,relaxing,4.0,,"it's a very nice park with bustling with activities during the weekend. take a stroll, eat food, cycle or do other fun stuff."
,,Went cycling along the east coast shore,4.0,,"Went cycling for 1 hour with my bf here. A lot of people are playing at the beach, having picnic, jogging, cycling, roller blading, and even barbecuing! Such a nice place to unwind and do a lot of outdoor activities! This is my second visit here and I think I will still find a reason to be back again."
,,"Outdoor activities, awesome place",5.0,,"It was our first time visiting this place. We visited at Satyrday and a lot of people walked and played. It had playground for kids. Our children liked it. They could play with the sand. The view was very beautiful.
We suggest you to bring hat and sunglass if you want to visit this place."
,,Perfect place for outdoor activities,5.0,,"The East Coast Park stretches along Singapore’s shores roughly between the centre and the airport. It’s a very nice and mostly well kept park, but some plastics and litter weren’t cleaned at the time we were in the park.
ECP offers lots of activities. Among others, one can do biking, walking, camping, barbecueing, swimming, jet-skiing, and of course eating. There are food courts and good restaurants.
Access by car is easy as there are many car parks. Public transport - we’ll, there is a commuter bus line or one takes a walk to get to the park."
,,Good reasons to be outdoor,4.0,,"This park is 15km long! You can stroll, jog, cycle, skate, swim, build sand castles, fish at the jetty, indulge in water sports, pitch a tent, have a BBQ, or go to the children's playground. When tired or hungry, there are many dining options - hawker center, seafood center, fast food outlets and restaurants. Go and enjoy!"
,,Great!!,4.0,,"The park is a really good venue for families to have picnics during the weekends, or even cycle to marina barrage, gardens by the bay or even just in the park! There's many bicycle rentals and it's really convenient"
,,theres a skatepark,5.0,,"came here this morning, beautiful greenery and view of the ocean, pity that there is some rubbish washed up onto the beach. surprised to find a huge skatepark here, with some coaches giving morning lessons."
,,Best Place to Relax in Singapore,5.0,,"Wish i could go back and chill out at the East Coast Park. It was awesome.
My favorite Hang Out at Singapore.
The beach is nice and provides the constant breeze. Landscaping is amazing.
Lots of cycling options. We did many 5 km rides.
Many people on skates and battery. Many eating options.
Best Relaxing option. I can go back to Singapore just to chill out at east coast park!!!"
,,Have a relaxing time,5.0,,Indeed a beautiful place to relax. Take a ride it bicycle and visit the beach. Evenings can be better spend here.
,,No more seashells,3.0,,Was really disappointed when I came here on a quest to pick some seashells and there weren't any. Nevertheless it's a nice place to come with your family/friends/partner!
,,Great for family picnic,5.0,,This beach has less tourist compared to Sentosa. It is very clean and there are many eateries around the park.
,,An alternate for Sentosa Beach,4.0,,"ECP , as we found out was a huge stretch with sea on one side and a highway on the other. Its a man made beach where people come for fishing,camping , cycling, playing, etc. You can spot BBQ stands everywhere. walking down the stretch is so relaxing since it's not crowded at all. The adjacent food court offers a wide variety of options to choose from."
,,Playground under construction,5.0,,"We came to the park with our kids, unfortunately the playground is currently close, the park though is beautiful as described"
,,Great park for cycling,5.0,,"Bikes can be hired from the bike shop in Section B $12 first hour , 2nd hour free 3rd hour $4 ... $16 for 3 hours , make sure the taxi takes you to Section B , ours dropped us of in section C and we had to walk for an hour to the bike hire . There are city bikes to hire using an app if you have a smart phone and the app . The ride is great , flat wide pathways along the water front though the parkland . We went on a Wednesday so it was not to busy , on Saturdays and Sundays it can be very busy with locals ."
,,Bike hire at E2 car park - for Grab taxis,5.0,,"Such fun for a couple of hours which is probably about the right amount of time. The food court is great, particularly Leng Heng Chicken Rice - his char siew pork and noodles is excellent as is a whole coconut drink at a stall further down. With all the containers off shore I would think those waters could be both dangerous & unhealthy so would not care to swim there. We went during the week and it was not too crowded. Cycling towards Gardens by the Bay to the barrage and back including fixing a bike chain took under 2 hours for 3 adults."
,,Rent a bike and go!,5.0,,"Get one of the rental bikes. Beautiful. You can watch planes fly in low over the park. Clean and by the water, beautiful. THere is an excellent hawker center there."
,,Chilled out evening,4.0,,"We spent a lazy evening at the ECP, where we rode bikes and made sand castles.... the kids had a wonderful time and so did the adults. Its a nice place, though we wish there were no ships as the view is obstructed."
,,Singapore’s most popular park & best beach,4.0,,"It was a beautiful spring day at the 185-hectare, Eastern Coast Park beach. This is a man-made beach, built on reclaimed land. Most people had come out to relax, chill out, exercise, have a leisurely walk in the breeze coming off the sea, walk or jog with your dog, have quality family time, picnic, camp and stay overnight, barbeque, fish, rent a bike and cycle or skate in the beach-park, enjoy the fresh air by the sea, and watch the kids play on the beach.

There are a few eateries and lots of public toilets conveniently located throughout the park.

No entry fee."
,,Cycling through East Coast Park,3.0,,"Returned to East Coast Park again this morning for some early cycling. At around 6.30am it's not too busy and you can cycle quite easily. On the return journey though, at around 9:30am, it's a different story and the place can get very crowded. You need to be very careful when cycling as there are people everywhere and young kids who aren't really paying attention. Still, it's a nice shady place and a standard cycling route between the city are and East Coast."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Okay, so the view of the tankers on the coastline off Singapore may not seem so splendid, but this is a lovely park, and it genuinely feels like it's by the sea (which it is). There is a lovely seafood park as part of it, where there are some great eateries."
,,Hidden gem,5.0,,"I had been to Singapore many times years before and this trip we went to the first time to the ECP and were very positively surprised. A large outdoor area with pathways for strolling as well as bicycle lanes, many restaurants and cafes, views of the sea and a small beach, all next to the highway. I think for those trying to escape the hustle and bustle of downtown Singapore this is a great destination, also for families and for all those who just want to relax."
,,Wonderful beach to enjoy with friends and family,4.0,,The beach is clean and with lots of trees around provides walking and playing areas. Cycling is a popular activity. Multiwheel and multipaddle cycling by whole family together are quite common. Facilities for barbecue and camping exist. The adjacent food court offers a wide variety of options to choose from.
,,My children enjoyed it,4.0,,"One of the weekend afternoon, we decided to bring the kids to the beach. Of course the first place in mind was eat Coast beach. Very long stretch of beach with bicycle rental kiosk scattered along the park. Can be tiring cycling along the long stretch of beach though. Many food eateries can be found along this beach from your wallet friendly hawker food to your seafood restaurants!"
,,Huge park and stretch of beach,5.0,,"Visited here whilst staying in Katong. A beautiful green space on the edge of this bustling city.

Perfect for walks, exercise (separate cycle and jogging road), dining, socialising, BBQ etc.

I’m sure it’s busy at the weekends with local families for very good reason. Safe and beautifully maintained."
,,Local Food Galore!,4.0,,"Best place to come here for your local fix. Close to airport so basically stopped over here for a quick bite before heading to the hotel.

I’m a Huge oyster omelette fan but the Singaporean version was a little let-down. Oysters were raw-ish. Prefer the Thai, Taiwanese, Vietnamese and even the Shanghainese version instead.

Great having a nice cold sugar cane juice on a summer’s night!"
,,Great family outing,4.0,,"There are many activities you can do here at east coast park- camping, cycling, pinic, skating and even enjoy the good food at the restaurants.

Great recreation for the young and the old. You can camp there without applying for a license. There are also bbq pits there."
,,Great big park,4.0,,"I came here for parkrun,this is big park with walking,running and cycling sections.People do tai chai too .Showers,toilets and changing rooms all there .A big park to explore"
,,All those boats,4.0,,What a sight this is. Seeing over 100 boats in the Malaccan Straits. My son and his cousins went for a dip but we were very careful not to let them accidently drink any of the water. Definitely worth a trip and a bit of an eye opener.
,,Relax by the beach,4.0,,"This would be one of the cleanest parks I have ever seen. The paths are maintained, there is plenty of accessible underpasses or overpasses to reach the park and it feels incredibly safe walking around there. The park is massive, so choose a chunk and explore it. We were near Katong and visited one afternoon to get away from the noise of the city, and it's amazing how quiet it feels."
,,Lovely place to spend the day,5.0,,"We spent a whole day relaxing on the beach, used the showers & changing rooms and then had an early dinner here. Highly recommended."
,,Know it Well!,5.0,,"I walked this park nearly every morning for almost 2 months. My walks took me from the lagoon to Bedok Jetty and the parking lot and beyond. My other walk was from the lagoon to Marine Terrace or Parkway for breakfast. The scenery is interesting from the high rise apartments across the road, to the green belt and Singapore Harbour full of ships. The green belt has a good walking path and a separate trail for bikes. Good place to jog as well. I recommend an early walk (5.30am) before the sun comes up and it gets hot. The people fishing on the Jetty were friendly and I enjoyed chatting with them. There are certain sections for overnight campers and you need a permit. There are places to eat @nd get refreshments. If you want to ride a bike, use one of the bike sharing programs. My lasting impression of this area, is the ships lined up in the harbour, 100’s of them. Well worth the visit for a leisurely walk for bike ride."
,,A family trip,4.0,,A lovely place to spend a morning or evening Nice cycling spaces...with shops offering cycles on rent Restaurants around...families relaxing...great vibes
,,Nice Park Contratsing With The Apartments Across The Road,3.0,,"This park runs along the highway from the airport to the city and provides a good expanse of tropical green, sea views including loads of ships and some casual restaurants. It provides a needed respite from the high rise housing across the road and is an asset to Singapore."
,,scenic beach and park,4.0,,"This is the longest stretch of sea-facing cycling trail along the beach, which stretches from car park F at the east towards car park A at the west, and beyond towards Gardens by the Bay. Very scenic and relaxing."
,,"Relaxing, Scenic Park",4.0,,"I went there for a morning run. It was a relaxing and scenic park along the coast of Singapore. The park is full of locals and expats; walking their dogs, jogging, running, playing sand, etc. After the run, I had a breakfast at McDonald's at Marine Cove. Besides this food outlet, there were other outlets and also convenience stores located along the park."
,,East Coast combines all the scenic features,4.0,,"East Coast Park provides a comprehensive package of scenic beauty. Sea beach, landing of air crafts, anchorage of huge no of ships, beautiful park with very nice sea view, such sumptuous sea foods all put something to your travel cart. This is a perfect place for running, cycling or just for a walk. The park is big enough to do even a long run, has good paths, some toilets and showers even. It’s full of runners and cyclists always. The place is always full with a varied crowd.

I had the chance to visit there on December 2016. And again this February I along with my family visited this awesome place."
,,Breeze and Bike!,5.0,,"This place is on east cost of Singapore..so ECP! Has Separate walking path and rental rollers bikes, rental cycling , rental fishing ,BBQ after reserving and doing online payment can be done.sitting arrangements near BBQ .every BBQ has trash bins too to make place clean after using and easy fr not use..Lot of people on walking paths can be seen.small kids were seen too enjoying rides by strollers and rollers.Beach is clean.nice place"
,,Not sure what all the fuss is about,3.0,,"In an area of the World where one can find truly wonderful beaches I don't really see why people recommend this. There are plenty of much more memorable things to see and do in Singapore.

What I would recommend here is the parkrun. There are a nice bunch of volunteers and a varied crowd: a mixture of locals, expats and tourists. A word of warning, despite being flat, do not expect to get a PB unless you've acclimatized to the humidity.

If you found this review helpful please give it the thumbs up. Thanks!"
,,"Nice for strolls, biking and sunsets",4.0,,"No, there is not a real beach, but you still have views over the sea and you can see great sunsets. It's nice to walk there, to bike and for the campers amongst us also for camping or doing your own BarbieQ"
,,Outdoor sport paradise,5.0,,"This is a perfect place for running, cycling or just for a walk. The park is big enough to do even a long run, has good paths, some toilets and showers even. It’s full of runners and cyclists in the mornings."
,,Singapore Beach!,5.0,,"This is how i would introduce this, Singapore beach. Beautiful calm serene and safe. Awesome place to feel the breeze and the water. People cycle, walk, jog, couple bicycles, tents, barbeque and even do picnics in groups. There is Mc. Donalds which is opened 24*7 too in this area just at the beach. The complete stretch is known as East coast park and is huge. Its a lovely place."
,,Great place to cycle along,4.0,,We visited here and hired some bikes - plenty of places around to do so all similar prices. Definitely the best way to see all along the park in a short space of time. Quiet place away from the city and a little beach area too so great for a chill out or sunbathe.
,,Great place,5.0,,Good place to go for a walk with love ones as well as do activities like cycling or roller blading. Also a good place for bbq if you have book a pit. Good nature view
,,Nice relaxing,5.0,,"Come here in the early morning for a cycling session, come here late at night to enjoy the sea breeze."
,,"Very nice, peaceful, clean and very very long",4.0,,"It is a very huge park on the coastline and stretches for almost 15 kms. The Park offeres various recreational facilities like skating, cycling, volleyball, watersports and much more. You can either go on the beach for a picnic and relax or go for a jog or cycling on the 15km stretch, this park is a perfect weekend gateaway for all ages."
,,Impressive government achievement,5.0,,"This is not a 5 star beach. This is not somewhere you can go and sunbath on the sand with a rum and coke. There are tens of ships moored in sight of the shore ... It's not somewhere you'd want to swim.
But I've given it 5 stars because of what the Singaporean government has made out of what they had. They've put thought and care into creating a wonderful addition to the Singaporean urban environment - there an awesome children's playground, bike rental shops, and best of all a continuous bicycle path which extends the full length of the coast. A wonderful place to cycle.
There are also bbq stations which can be hired out for social gatherings.
I am hugely impressed and full of admiration for what Singaporean society has created here.

Suggestion for improvement: better food places. There's a wide choice, but none of them are really that good - I've been to about 8 of them."
,,Invigorating & refreshing!,4.0,,"Early morning walks in the park are both invigorating and refreshing. Start out around 6 am and hit the park by 6:20 am, walking at regular paces from Area E (Lagoon Food Centre) to Area G for a glorious sunrise around 7:25 am+. The views along the pedestrian paths are beautiful and can be surprising too. Each day’s early morning views can be very different if you open your mind and take in the scenes unfolding during your walk. I really enjoyed the calm, fresh air, colours of the sky and shapes of the clouds together with the sounds of pounding feet and chatters, waves, planes flying past above towards Changi Airport and chirping birds."
,,walk along the beach,3.0,,"Our apartment was a short walk and very worth while on a hot, humid morning. The tree lined avenue has several bike hiring serviced places and refreshment machines."
,,rest and recuperation,4.0,,Lovely spot on the coast on outskirts of CBD. good place to visit in mornings before everything else opens in CBD. hassle to visit without car though. but good place for picnic or bbq with friends
,,Miles of Tranquility with Views,4.0,,"Decided to walk the whole thing having been told by my hosts that it is worth the effort. Set off from Braddell and took the circle line to Stadium (you could start at Gardens by the Bay). Crossed the footbridge outside Stadium complex after breakfast in a Kallang Wave Mall cafe (Foodfare). Then a bit on road past Singapore Swimming Club (there is infrastructure construction in this area), then into the East Coast Park. Lovely jungle feel at the start then the beach and sea to your right after the first mile. Nice sandy beaches, shaded by palms. Spectacular sight of hundreds of cargo ships, stacked up in a que for miles, waiting to go into the container port. Enough to keep me interested the whole day. Lots of WCs (with outdoor changing cubicles and showers for beach swimmers). Cycle hire/repair stations. Cafes and restaurants at various points along the way. It's about 12 miles in all and hot but the path is mostly shaded. Should have brought swimming trunks. A superb day out with a very good and reasonably priced lunch at the lagoon hawkers center (just over half way). A really interesting, healthy day out with not too much commercial stuff. Highly recommended."
,,The best place to do long continous runs in Singapore,5.0,,"Runners in Singapore looking for long distance training are typically constrained by the length of uninterrupted and safe running paths. From one end of East Coast Park to another (ending point at National Service Resort and Country Club), it is easily more than 10 kilometers. If this 1-way distance is not enough, you can even keep on running in the direction of Changi Beach along the park connector like I do (just bear in mind there are no water coolers or toilet stops after East Coast Park proper). Having run in many places of the world, there is nowhere as safe as a run in this park; female runners can run at 3am and still feel very safe with lights all over and other fitness enthusiasts likewise out exercising at unearthly hours (I am sometimes one of them). Just be careful during weekends when the pathways tend to get crowed. Tip: be considerate when walking or running by keeping to the side and being aware of other park users overtaking on your right, as well as ensure your kids don't suddenly change directions for their safety."
,,VERY NICE PARK,5.0,,"YOU CAN rent cycle you can walk you can have clean beach to enjoy.you can enjoy even sunset here.its long beach to enjoy with,."
,,Less crowded and open spaces,5.0,,"If you looking for an alternate location to Sentosa and just want to relax by the beach, then this is a great place to visit. Much less crowded, depending on the day and time you choose, as compared to Sentosa and so comparatively activities too in some ways. Yet all in all a great place for a day with family and friends."
,,A nice park by the Beach...,5.0,,"best to be relaxed after the whole day of shopping or hanging out....awesome view with clean and beautiful nature...its will bring peace and calm to your mind...we enjoyed the time there cycling and walking around...ended up by taking our dinner there..so many options to eat like chinese,malay,local....you can get every type of food here and of course....CHEAP.."
,,Awesome path to run,5.0,,This park that runs along the east coast of Singapore and has a few small beaches but otherwise is probably the best park to run or bicycle along. Has Jumbo seafood restaurant alongside a couple of other seafood restaurants
,,Recreational space for everyone at Marine Cove,5.0,,"An excellent place overall. Great for jogging and you may have a chance to catch the sunrise/sunset if the weather isn't overcast.

There's great food and a big playground at Marine Cove. A great recreational space for families, cyclists and everyone else.

However, it is a bit difficult to access East Coast Park by public bus as there is only 1 bus (Bus 401) that passes through it.

Very peaceful and quiet during weekdays but tend to be noisy and crowded during weekends and public holidays especially National Day (every 9 Aug)"
,,Great for families,5.0,,Great for families with kids. We had breakfast and coffee at the adjoining McDonalds and cafe. Kids played for hours in the great playground. Plenty of shade.

,,"Picnic, cycling, sand castle",4.0,,"The beach wasn't really that nice for swimming. Just good enough. But it's a good place for picnic and cycling. You get the view of Straits of Singapore from the park, lots of military ships. A jetty (Bedok Jetty) for fishing that you can walk along. Also a nice small castle that keeps sand castle equipment for rental. It's also call Sand Castle Beach. As for cycling, I saw a shop that offers bicycle for rental at $10 for 3 hours."
,,Relaxing Bicycle Ride,3.0,,I visited East Coast Park once in a while to ride bicycle. It now has a park connector that links all the way to Marina areas. It was very nice to ride there and along the way there are places for us to rest and have some food and drink. That’s indeed a nice experience.
,,A breeze away from the heat,5.0,,"I walked along part of the parkway and also hired a bike and it was amazing. Cool breeze,mass the famous otters twice, stopped at Starbucks for coffee
Went right round the barrage, past the Marina Bay harbour hotel and into Boat quay, 6 mile ride
Love the parkway and a must to get some air"
,,Lovely Park,4.0,,"The East Coast park is a welcome place to visit if staying in Katong Area. The park is well used, is relaxed with plenty of amenities from BBQ's that can and are used by local families at the weekends, picnic tables next to the beach, bike paths, bars and restaurants. We ate a lovely home made Singaporean Laksa at a picnic tables and whiled away the time watching families having an enjoyable time. The horizon had wall to wall ships anchored in the bay. A lovely relaxed place to visit away from the hussle and bussle of the city."
,,Good place to bike and relax in this busy island,5.0,,"We rented bikes at "" 12 cycling"" shop and took the underpath to go through the EC highway. The trees along the biking trail offered shadowed cool air. Children playground was well designed. Every one or two miles there would be some restaurants and bathrooms. Interestingly, you may see quite a lot of big ships not far from you while you are cycling."
,,eat cycle stroll,4.0,,"The park is the best part of Singapore it is huge and you can spend an entire day with family.
There are also various nice restaurants with nice open sitting. Kids can enjoy cycling swings and the beach but again as its a huge park you need to plan what you want to do and then accordingly choose from where you want to enter the park and spend time."
,,Great spot to bike and stroll,4.0,,"Great spot to bike, stroll, run even picnic with friends and family. It can get quite crowded in the weekend which can be a bit uncomfortable. Some go there to barbeque gathering or small bday party. There is a big children playground Marine Cove its pretty cool although I think its more suitable for bigger kids 3+. Lots of eateries and cafes to choose from and hang out."
,,East Coast Park,5.0,,Great spot to relax and walk along the seaside. They have some options to rent a bike along the path. There are separate tracks for walking/jogging and cycling/skating. They also have some resting areas along the way if you get tired.

,,Nice park,4.0,,"Great park for a stroll with kids playground, food hall, McDonald's, water ski area, skate park and bicycle hire. Just ensure you get taxi to drop you in the area you want to visit most as it's a very big park and was an hour walk from hawkers food hall to kids playground so if you don't have much time best to select the area you want to visit. Lovely family friendly park!"
,,Great spot to relax and walk along the sea,5.0,,"Such a nice park to have a long walk up to the city centre. There are some cafés along the way. Also opportunities to rent bicycle are available. There are lanes for both walker and cyclists/skater.
Walked here on a Saturday and it was not crowded at all."
,,"Beautiful, nice environments and clean~",5.0,,"I visited East Coast Park before went to the airport. Good place ~ beautiful beach and clear sky~ it made me don’t want to go back. I think it good when you come with friends, family or bf 🌊☘️🌤"

,,Pleasant environment,4.0,,Singaporean friends took us for seafood dinner there. Great environment and very pleasant. Will recommend to any tourist. Possibly quite away from city if one does not want to travel.
,,East Coast parkrun,5.0,,Did East Coast parkrun and it was fantabulous!!! Organisers were friendly and welcoming. It was easy to know what was happening. All visitors to the run/walk were looked after very well.
,,Cycling and Picnic,4.0,,"East Coast Park is a nice place to see the sea from the main island, especially if one is not living in the east park of the city state. The journey from the west part of Singapore to the east part can be done by taking MRT. The cycling track is long and passes through many rest areas and spots intended for photo-taking. Picnic can also be done late into the night."
,,Over rated,3.0,,Too crowded and the sea is not too clean. Nice for people watching and some decent restaurants but not worth spending a few hours.
,,Family beach outing,4.0,,"A favorite family location among locals for picnic, Bbq and camping. Good variety of restaurants from seafood to fast food. Bike rentals available and great to catch the sea rise at breakwater."
,,Full of Activities,5.0,,"Lots of weekend revelers here, mainly to hang by the beach and/or partake in beach activities. With the relaxing atmosphere, many families and individuals/couples come here as well; plenty of joggers, cyclists, dog-walkers, roller-skaters, etc."
,,Has it all,5.0,,"East Coast park stretches stretches a good one-third of the entire Singapore east coast. There are several things to do with friends, family, or even just alone. You can cycle, roller blade, run, work out, tai chi, swordplay. There are barbeque pits and grills, and small resorts with rooms facing the beach. You can do overnight camping. Seriously, you won't run out of things to do here."
,,"Sun, sand, sea",5.0,,"Great place for everyone: families, couples, friends. Lively, lots to see and do and eat. Our favourite is Enak-Enak teahouse for our Sunday brunch of dim sum and teh tarik."
,,Clean and Shady Beach Park by the Coast,5.0,,"The imported white sand on the beach is very fine and clean while the tall trees provide very good shade during the day. Kids like to make sand castles on the beach while BBQ pits are available for rent along the beach. There are also many seats and tents available for visitors to rest on the beach.

However do be careful during high tide as the water can get rough and eddies will form.

One is able to walk on the foot paths along the beach or cycle on the adjacent cycling paths. Rental Bicycles are available. Many visitors like to exercise there as the air is clean and fresh. Public restrooms with shower facilities are available as well.

There are many food and drink outlets along the park, and a very large and fun (challenging) children's playground near McDonald's'.
Besides restaurants and coffee houses, there is a large food court as well. Do try the Curry Puffs (Lagoon) there as they are excellent. There is also a mini Satay Club there. Also try the Laksa (Roxy) and Wanton Noodles.
Also within the park is a Seafood center where several of the best seafood restaurants in Singapore is located.

Enjoy this 185 hectare park with a 15 km scenic coastline either night or day. Instead of endless sea and sky, one would be surprised by the number of ships that anchor off the coast. During the night lights from the many many ships look like another city beyond the water."
,,Skinny little beach where you can watch 3000 oil tankers 100m away,1.0,,A great example of making the most of a bad situation. The beach is good by local standards. Realistically its a skinny strip of sand pumped there where you can watch the oil tankers and container ships 100 m from the shore... remember 25% of world trade travels this little strip of water between Singapore and Indonesia... There are rules about what they can pump into the sea in this strip but that's still not enough to get most people comfortable enough to swim there.
,,A good place for a clean swim,5.0,,"I had taken a local friend from Singapore to this beach in the day time.It seemed it was her first visit here.And the place is good for everyone because there were lots of visitors.
Lots of people are having a good swim with excellent swim wear.There were people with great bodies.And there were several people bicycling too.There marvellous places to eat too.Infact this place is a good place for recreation.This location is very near Joo Chiat.Actually seeing this places reminds person of many cards of the world shown on a blog and now we can see in the real world with great container ships in the background.The sea water was actually quite clear."
,,"Glad you got this one, Singas",5.0,,"As a cyclist I am rally glad this stretch exists. You can have a bbq if you have friends, laze under a tree if you have a book, do something with kids if you have finished boring everyone else with them, keep fit by the water on the walking/running/brisky track and outdoor gyms, skate or take some skate pictures at the bowl, or cycle up to Changi for a day trip.

It is very surreal being next to the water and seeing the heavy shipping traffic. I'm sure Panamans will feel right at home. Except for the wealth. And lack of potholes.

Every country can take note of and inspiration from ECP, not just Panama. These public spaces give youth a chance to socialise in a healthy manner, promote health and fitness, and help build community. As Starsky and Hutch said, do it.

Do it."
,,Biking Paradise in Singapore,5.0,,"Bring myfamily to have some binding time ,with walking and biking and and a lot of restaurant available"
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"The new play area is great for kids, my daughter ran about for ages, the walking paths are wide and the scenery lovely BUT there is so much rubbish on the beach and in the water. I know the parks management cannot stop things floating onto the beach from the sea, but it was awful. Pasir Ris park was as beautiful and cleaner....go there."
,,East coast park parkrun,4.0,,"Great park and amazing to think that you are in a massive city. No fumes, no pollution just lots of people walking, running, cycling - great place."

,,A break from city life,4.0,,"Although Singapore is a concrete jungle, coming to east coast park to rent a bicycle or roller blades is a good way to take a break. This place has convenient places to rest, eat or shower. Jogging is another key activity here. The sea is also pretty clean if you will like a dip."
,,All time favourite for families with kids!,5.0,,Sand! Beach! Sun! Bbq! Bicycle rental! All time favourites for families! Plenty of parking spaces! Always have something to do at c the park. Newly setup mcdonalds and other restaurants added vibrant to the locality.
,,Day out of town,5.0,,"Spent the morning at East Coast Park - hoping to get a windsurf in - but alas, no wind that day. Just walked along the beachfront & stopped for satay at the hawker stalls. Relaxing day out - albeit very hot (but that's to be expected in Singapore).

Top tip taxi back to town - quick and about $7."
,,Something for everyone,4.0,,"Great for outdoor activities e.g. Riding bikes, scooters, skate boards etc. little ones can build sandcastles on the beach. Different types of food is sold along the beachfront. If you care to barbecue yourself there are barbecue pits for hire."
,,A Simple Place Worth Your Visit,4.0,,"East cost park was primarily a narrow stretch of reclaimed seaside along the left side of East Coast Parkway as you travel down to city from the Changi Airport. It is facing the sea south of Singapore Island. Singaporean likes to hangout at the park, picnic, play with the sand and water, jogging, biking...or simply looking out for famous local seafood or international food. Day and night, it offers a spectacular view to the hundreds of daily-visiting ocean-going vessels coming into this one of the business water in the world. On a clear day, Batam island of Indonesia is in clear sight."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Just rent a bike and ride around and after biking for 3 hours take a beer and have it by the sea side. Best time i had in Singapore was in this park. A lot of things to do here with restaurant and tuc shops. If you have the numbers best activity here is a Bar b q. Or you may try your luck by going fishing
,,Great part of Singapore for bike riding,5.0,,"On our last day we hired bikes from 1 2 Cycles located in Marine Parade, then rode along ECP path past the airport to SAF Ferry Terminal then turned back, we rode further than expected but had a good time, the pathway wasn’t busy (Thursday) there’s plenty to do and see and shops only up to Tanah Merah Coast Rd then its just a long flat path to SAF Terminal, be warned, if you ride in the afternoon expect a head-wind on the way back. It was a good ride we saw different parts of Singapore only accessible by bike. If you’re interested it took us just under 3hrs to ride the 48km."
,,A great place to take a bike ride,5.0,,This is a great place to spend an afternoon on a bike! There are several places you can rent a bike and then stop at the East Coast Seafood Center for lunch or dinner. My suggestion would be to go during the week as it is packed with locals on the weekends.
,,A walk or a feast,4.0,,Great for walking or cycling or you can stroll to one of many Eateries and Food Courts - be prepared to wait in line for a meal and a seat on Weekend nights.

,,yes this owesome city offers beach life,5.0,,For relaxing or jogging having a picnic if you stay several days here in this wonderful city you will love a day at the East coast Park beach center
,,Best thing to do in Singapore,5.0,,"Getting a rental bike as a single, tandem or more and riding along the cycle ways next to white sand beaches and warm sand and in the shade of the trees is as good a thing as you can do in Singapore. The beaches would be more inviting if they did not have so many ships moored off shore but the water is certainly clean enough for swimming. Plenty of places to stop for eating and drinking. No cars but plenty of pedestrians."
,,Visit with overseas friends,5.0,,"love the sun, the sea and all the greenery!

Lots of children playground for kids to enjoy.

Variety of food in the park but as the park is huge and not all drive or bike, it may be harder to venture from one to the other end with public transport. A local shuttle up and down the beach ( from big splash to the food center on the other end) would help greatly I feel."
,,East Coast Parks,5.0,,"There are a number of Food Court and eateries along the East Coast Park area. There is Jumbos Seafood and the East Coast Lagoon Food Court, being by the sea they are mainly seafood but also have things like Singapore Carrot Cake and Satay. Enjoy a stroll along the beach after your meal to get rid of those added kilo's"
,,nice activity place,4.0,,"the park is a nice place to spend time. you can walk, run. sit on the bench. there are places for BBQ. if you wish you can also hire bi-cycles on hourly rate. they also have a playground for children. they also have a small beach."

,,"Lovely park on the waters edge, perfect for a walk",5.0,,Lovely park in a busy city. Did the Park Run on a Saturday morning and thoroughly enjoyed the event which was made more enjoyable by the scenery along the way. Very popular with many runners and walkers using the park.
,,Far away and dirty beach,3.0,,The sea is not nice. People come here for cycling and picnic. There are a few food outlet here. It far away from city and not accessible by public transport
,,East Coast Park : Off the Beaten Track,5.0,,"East Coast Park largely remains outside the must see/visit list of the majority of travelers. But surely it is one of the finest places to walk, jog and cycle in the Park which is beautifully spread and laid out along with beach/waterfront running parallel to it. The greenery and the views there are simply soothing !"
,,nice clean,5.0,,loved the small beach and the park. Has nice restaurants. Awesome for Bike ride... Loved it and nice area for picnic or just stroll
,,Rent bikes!,5.0,,"The park is huge and very well maintained! There is a small beach on one side and multiple BBQ pits for people to cook their own BBQ. We hired bikes from one of the shops and it was $10 for 2 hours, we were exhausted after the 2 hours but it's a great way to visit the park. Everyone is riding a bike, roller blading or jogging! Really interesting and lovely park."
,,Awesome place for everyone,5.0,,East coast park is an awesome place for everyone. You can come with friends and family for BBQ session. Or simply ride a bike and enjoy the sea breeze and sun rise.
,,Cycling from East Coast Park to Garden by the Bay,4.0,,It was a Friday evening around 5pm when me and 6 of my friends rented bikes from ECP and cycled all the way to Marina Barrage then Garden by the Bay. It took around 1 hour 30 minutes one way as we stop quite a number of times to take pictures hehe. It was cooling and relaxing and I think it will be a great activity for dating if you all are bored or watching movie and dinner! the view is awesome with cooling Breeze where u can forget ur worries for that number of time. We then had our dinner at Satay by the Bay which I think the food is affordable and nice. After that we visited Garden by the Bay and cycled all the way back. I Guess what makes the trip fun is who u experience it with. But overall it would be a suitable activity for a lazy Saturday evening where u got to spend time with ur loved ones
,,Fantastic but Dirty,3.0,,1. Nice place to have fun with friends and family. 2. Very Dirty due to lots of gathering. 3. Food Court : very less space of seating and Singaporean are reserving their seat for long time and not allow other race if those are vacant.
,,"Ship watching, exercise, cycling, wake boards, strolls a great day out",4.0,,"There is a lot on offer at this sea-side park for both the first-time visitor, frequent traveler or local. Hire a bike or some rollerblades and tour the many interesting bike paths and lanes. You can give a go at wake boarding or some curcuit training. Dotted along the park are various places to eat from a quick Starbucks to a resturant. There is even a nice walk from the park back towards the sea front. You will need to get your walking shoes on, a taxi or uber or bus to get there from the nearest station but definitely worth it."
,,"Unwind, Relax and Eat chili crab.. yummy.",4.0,,"A nice stop to enjoy sea breeze while in Singapore. Here you can have lunch or dinner through the numerous satay stands and sea food stalls which you can pick variety of dishes. Several activities are also available like biking, wake boarding or you can just take a nice walk along the park or in the beach front.

Surely I will return for the yummy chili crab while having a bottle of refreshment."
,,A day to remember,5.0,,We were so delighted that we were able to visit this place together with our family. The ambience is so refreshing and we enjoyed the food and other activities. We will surely come back.
,,"Cycling, Eating, Getting feet wet...just enjoy the views!",4.0,,"There are many things to do and be entertained at East Coast Park. Were the sand sugar white and the water pristine, I would rate it a five. Always had great food and good times when visiting ECP. Good night life too. Wonderful place to take visitors as a change from Marina Bay. Expect higher prices here as so many expats visit!"
,,miss it so much now we moved away,5.0,,"We lived along the East Coast for nearly 10 years and moved away only for the kids' school location.

Miss this huge beachside park so much! There are many underpasses from Marine Parade road, Meyer Road, Upper east Coast road making it easy for joggers and bladers to cross the ECP expressway. Cyclists may need to carry or push bikes up the steep ramp.

We've seen many reincarnations of the various restaurant and leisure areas. When we first arrive around 2003, there was still the Big Splash waterslide (badly maintained with chipped slides by then) and the old MacDonalds and Burger King.

Loved jogging during the day and our regular Family cycle every sunday night. This is a very safe and familly friendly environment even at night.

Best thing a the kids grew and could bike/jog further was the variety of things to do and places to eat. Easy to hire bikes, pedal carts, springy boots, remote control toys. basic shower and toilet facilities along the main paths. Singapore largest skatepark opposite the Bayshore road underpass and a Wakeboarding lake near the Bedok entrance. Whatever happened to the Mana Mana seasports place? I remember sending my kids for week long summer day activities and did a stand up paddleboarding course there.

Weekends though you need to be careful as some pedestrians and bikers havve no road sense."
,,good for walk but swimming could be dangerous,4.0,,good for walk spent time in park but swimming could be dangerous as very stripy specially for children.
,,A great feature to have in an urban jungle,5.0,,The park stretches for kilometers. It has a path for riders and runners. It's a good place to take the family for a picnic at one of the picnic tables or simply on the grass. They have a new kids park for them to climb around. And it is close to several restaurants (and coffee for those parents that need it with the dozens of kids running around). We usually go for brunch on Sundays. Check it out. It's another great place in Singapore.
,,Nice for biking,4.0,,"It's lovely for a walk or to bike but it can be very humid and can get sweaty otherwise. The food court is nice and there are a few places to rent a bike and to grab a coffee. If the weather suits you, it's lovely for a walk. Can be slightly far from the heart of the city if one doesn't live in the East. Due to the location and because I'm not much of a biker, I won't go back but it's ideal for athletic people who want some fresh air and a good workout outdoors and in a big space."
,,Serene and beautiful,4.0,,A bit crowded if weather is good. The east coast park is biggest open area park in Singapore. One can sit and chit chat by Sunset or you can hire Cycle to move around. A lots of place available for Kids to keep them happy. Get some time and enjoy your evening with your loved one at ECP (commonly known in Singapore)
,,Beachside relaxed vista worth a visit,4.0,,One of the few places in the island of Singapore where you can get to walk on the beach. Great views of the skyline and the many ships that are anchored off the coast. You can even swim here in the sea!
,,"GO to eat, walk, bike, so many things to do",5.0,,"Good spot! the food court is great, you can get huge good singapore chilli crab or any other type. and walk around looking at the sea"
,,Very relaxing walk,5.0,,"Great for cycling, walking and running or having fish and chips by the sea, great for couples and families."
,,Nice beach,4.0,,One of the longest stretch of beach in Singapore. Rent a bicycle or take a slow stroll. Watch the people unwind.
,,Beautiful seaside,5.0,,"Relaxing and beautiful area along the seaside, walking, cycling, photos, then go for a seafood meal to spend a weekend afternoon."
,,"East Coast Park, Beach lover places",5.0,,"East Coast Park, ride a bicycle, sit at the beach to feel the wind blowing, jogging, eat the seafood, walking, play the sands. All you need to do is relax!"
,,Exciting,5.0,,"It's a non-touristy place, so that makes it all the more exciting. You have water sports there, it's a brilliant picnic spot, or you can organize a barbecue as well"
,,"Beautiful park, somewhat crowded and risqué",4.0,,This is a wonderfully designed and naturally beautiful park along the Southeastern coast. Large sandy beach with ample waves but the sight of heavy industrial equipment and supertankers just offshore make it seem likely a questionable swim. My Son is going through a phase where he loves planes so the sight of a plane coming out of the clouds to land at Changi every 2 -5 minutes was really enjoyable. Perhaps we picked the wrong day to visit but it was quite crowded and some of the behaviour was a little risqué in front of pre-teen inquisitive kids.
,,Long path to explore,4.0,,"At East Coast Park, there are shops that offer rental services for bikes and rollerskates which can cover more of the path in a shorter time. In between shops to bbq pits, the path has plenty of trees and greenery for viewing.

This place has very limited seating and shelter, therefore should be visited only on a day with good weather. Another possible activity is to visit the beach and pop over the hawker centre for a meal after."
,,Superb ! Loved it.,5.0,,"Its a nice park. We went there as tourists.
It was a very pleasant evening. We took walk and our daughter played in the sand as well.
There are few restaurants to grab quick food.
You could plan one evening if you are a tourist with young children. Kids will love it."
,,Walk by the beach,3.0,,"A popular place for the family, especially during the weekends. Can rent bicycles there. Popular with joggers"
,,Lively & Chilling,5.0,,"We traveled by bus to Chij Katong Convent (92089) and walk for about 10-15 minutes to reach East Coast Park.

The park was very well organized, from BBQ areas, bicycle lanes, jogging track, to exercising equipment and other park amenities. Do opt for renting a bicycle here itself and cycle all the way to Garden's by the Bay East where you can get an amazing sunset view painted with Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Flyer and it's cityscape."
,,Dirty and noisy.,2.0,,"This part of Singapore can be improved. There are too many pubs and expensive seafood restaurants.So a walk along the East Coast isnt as peaceful as other beaches as this one is so commercialised. It is also very noisy, and has a row of dirty looking chalets which look delapidated. Strange for clean cosmopolitan Singapore!"
,,A must-cycle area of Singapore.,4.0,,"We would strongly advise getting an Obike for the ease of it and cycling along the paths towards the Flower dome.

The journey is lovely with lots of places to take photos, stop and eat and generally enjoy a day outside with picnics etc.

The beach is nice but very messy in places due to the campers. Though i wouldn't advise coming here to sunbathe, it was an amazing bike ride and a very easy one at that due to the relaitvely flat journey the whole way.

Very easy to spend the majority of a day here."
,,"Great area to walk, run, cycle, swim and have nice food",5.0,,"We love this area very much. It's a long beach road. Perfectly for walking, running, cycling, having nice food and to swim. Swimming is possible if there isn't oil in the water. What sometimes occurs."
,,Easter Morning Walk,4.0,,"Woke up early this Easter morning. Took my pet to East Coast Park for morning stroll.

A sunny cool morning with many activities by the beach. Started walking from Siglap Link to Marine Crescent about 1.6 km, to and fro 3.2 km. Saw many camping tents at designated campsite. People fishing, practicing qigong, cycling, jogging etc. Many pet lovers walking their dogs. Stationery ships docked outside its bay. Cool fresh air, sea breeze and the sun warm up the land, while rising from the east. Many waves hitting the shore.

Great morning spent. Enjoyed."
,,Nice Cycle Trail,4.0,,"A great place to bike ride along the beaches at a leisurely pace, away from cars and pedestrians. I cycled towards Garden by the Bay, although you can also cycle towards LongBeach and have seafood there."
,,Great outdoor spot,4.0,,"Have driven past many times ... needed to fill in some time before checking into hotel.
I booked a stand up paddle board lesson and meeting place was East Coast Park!
What a great start to the day!
Public change room,toilets and showers available.. clean!
Small sandy beach, very gentle waves.
I couldn't understand why more people weren't swimming!

The park extends for a large area along the beachfront. Children's playgrounds, shallow pools, ice cream shops, various eating places.
Even saw roller blading lessons in progress .
Areas for BBQ and eating
Bicycle hire places..
After my stand up paddle boarding lesson I hired a bike.. cycled along as far as I could before an afternoon tropical storm hit.
Luckily I made it to a restaurant where I was able to dig and watch the storm pass.
Wonderful family spot to get out and enjoy the outdoors!"
,,Very enjoyable - rent a bike!,5.0,,"Spent a morning riding up and down the park on rental bikes. Picked up two mountain bikes at the west end at the Bike Stop. The long linear park has an excellent separation of walking and bike pathways (not that everyone sticks to their path).

Loved the views of the bay and the hundreds of ships out there.

There are plenty of places to stop for food, picnic, beach etc.

NOTE - Spray yourself for bugs. We have relatives that caught Dengi riding bikes here."
,,Quiet and nice,5.0,,"The best beach I have been so far. Its little further away from all the noise, very clean and well maintained beach."
,,A Venue To De-stress,5.0,,"A place for you to do a myriad of things like walking, jogging, running, cycling, bbqs, picnics, water sports, etc. Also available are food outlets and a hawkers' centre for those eating-in as well as for take-aways."
,,Great nearby city escape,5.0,,"East Coast Park is a great way to get a nature feel close to the city. There's bike rental places, or one can simply walk or run the path. There's lots of great places to picnic, but there's also plenty of food options along the way (from fast food to great chili crab places). You also get a pretty awesome view of all the ships waiting to use the port."
,,Big and full of activities,5.0,,"Full of activities you can do at the park. You can rent a bicycle and cycle all the way to the jetty. It's a clean park, with clean beach. You can choose to picnic there and BBQ. There are many restaurants and cafes, as well as fast food restaurants so you will never have to worry about getting hungry!"
,,great for walk at the weekend and lots of amenities,5.0,,"Very busy park - full of walkers, cyclists and people having picnics. Lots of convenient BBQ points and shops as well - so you can always stop off and eat - everything from starbucks to jumbo seafood. Great to stop into the reservoir and watch the jet skiing goign round on a wire!"
,,Great Place for Bike Rides and Picnics,5.0,,"Perfect place to spend a day. Every 1km or so there are bike rental places with super reasonable rates. Separate cycle paths and walking paths mean you can cycle really safely all the way from Changi down to Gardens by The Bay.

There are also large BBQ pits that can be rented out - always looks so fun when big groups all get together here. The pits need booking in advance though as it is especially busy on Sundays."
,,Great way to escape the city,4.0,,"An excellent place to visit when in Singapore. Lots to do if you spend the morning, afternoon or a full day here with beaches, lush flora and bike and walking paths. Recommend hiring a bike and the hawker centre here. Good attraction!"
,,Excellent park,4.0,,"East Coast park is a great place for locals and visitors to Singapore. The park connects all the way from Gardens by the bay to round the back of the airport and eventually Changi beach. I often cycle the full length of it at the weekend.

You can rent bicycles from many different places in the park and ride along to enjoy the view and the sea breeze.

There are places to get food and drinks like East Coast lagoon food center.

And there are activities to try like the cable ski, the skate park, Bedok pier and Marina Cove.

Although the beaches do not have your idyllic tropical island look, they are quite ok and there are plenty of spots to bring a picnic and enjoy the weather.

Not to be missed."
,,Relaxing afternoon,3.0,,My kids wanted the beach during our short trip into Singapore from Johor. And East Coast Park provided a nice relaxing breezy afternoon. Beach was decent in cleanliness and water clean enough for play. Convenient parking site and foodcourt a few steps away.
,,"A sea view, a sea breeze.",4.0,,"The East Coast Park is a tremendous facility for locals, particularly on the weekend with families and friends picnicking, walking, running, cycling, fishing, and even swimming. For visitors who want a low key break from the busy city, plus a cooling breeze, the park provides a pleasant interlude, and more shipping to look at than you can shake a stick at. Combine it with a trip to another attraction, such as a waterfront restaurant, or laksa at Katong, and you have a different dimension to your Singapore experience."
,,Excellent park connector and cycling to Gardens by the Bay!,5.0,,"The park connector has now extended the cycling paths from end of East Coast Park near Fort Road all the way to Gardens by the Bay East Garden, with excellent views of the Singapore skyline! From here, you can continue to cycle to Marina Barrage and Gardens by the Bay Main gardens. There is a new bicycle kiosk near the underpass from Katong garden too!"
,,Not worth going if you have seen a real beach,1.0,,good path for cycling or jogging and seafood restaurants with sea view (Singapore standard of seaview). Otherwise not worth visiting as the beach is...no comment with a view of gazillion cargo ships...
,,Cycling track,4.0,,"If you love cycling or running, this is the place to be. Goes through the sea side and gives an excellent view of the Singapore harbour."
,,A relaxing stroll,4.0,,"A wonderful place for a relaxing stroll and people watching. The park is frequented very much by families with and without children enjoying the seaside, having a picnic or riding tandems, 4 wheel bikes, Segways and other assorted modes of transport."
,,Good place to picnic or hang out before dinner,4.0,,"We were heading to have some seafood nearby so had an hour to enjoy the sunset and the beach. It's not some paradise beach and you have ships in the background but if you have kids, just a few minutes on the sand will make them happy. Bring some snacks if you're staying a bit longer but otherwise, good diversion before dinner."
,,"Usually Amazing, But Today Poor.",3.0,,"I usually love East Coast Park. I love biking on Tandoms and riding bikes in general by the lovely coast. But I was not impressed yesterday. I left my house with no greases, bumps or anything. But when I came back after 2 hours. I was left with two bloody greases and dirty sore hands. All I was doing, was walking on a flat enough surface for me not to fall. I am an adult and have good balance. So I was surprised and quite angry. But I hope to revisit this place with no complaints as usually it is lovely."
,,Great for an afternoon's cycling,4.0,,"Come along, rent a bike and just cycle along the well tended cycleways and take in views of the ocean and the planes landing at Changi. Great!"
,,Nice beach to relax with family,4.0,,The beach is nice but not clean. One can find bottles and trash on the surface of the sea. Most of the people will either cycle or run there near the beach which has a running and cycle tracks.
,,Nice for a walk but needs developing,3.0,,a nice walk along the ocean with several seafood stalls available in different buildings along the beach. Most of them were closed and it seems a little bit dirty. Good for a budget eat but if you are just there for a walk it is great
,,A good places for the whole family an d friends gatering,4.0,,"Good seaside views, good foods, lots of recreational facilities and you can even book a BBQ pit just by the sea with your family or friends"
,,Great place for quiet weekday evening walk,4.0,,Great place for quiet weekday evening walk. Glad that no much of East Park Park has changed over the years... at least for the areas that I love to walk. Have a few blocks of eateries/cafes.
,,Green and clean,5.0,,"Amazing to find such a place in a big city, the best place to walk, run or cycle, sit down for a drink, relax, and enjoy the surroundings."
,,"Great for picnics, water sports and bikes",4.0,,"The East coast park runs a along the coast towards changi and has restaurants, food courts, bike and skate hire and saling clubs along the way. There is also a jetty which is a popular sport for the local anglers to try their luck. If you can handle the heat its a great place for a run or ride and often you will find competitions and fun runs in the area.If you are driving take a picnic mat as the ground can be damp on the grassy areas."
,,Pleasant,5.0,,The Easy Coast Park was cleaned up (not really dirty) when I was there which just added to the enjoyment of the place. The cool breeze coming off the Bay was most welcome.
,,Relaxing time and food food food,4.0,,Fantastic day out and good for the body and the mind. Loads of food venues and plenty to do on a slow sunday stroll.
,,Great place for many activities,5.0,,"You can jog, cycle,swim, roller blade or skate. Well maintain path, clean toilet and BBQ pit for use. Many food and drinks joints especially at the end towards changi airport."
,,Good exercise and relaxing place,4.0,,"Fresh breeze, good running/cycling tracks, important to practise common sense when using these tracks to avoid collision."
,,"The breathing ""Green Lung"" of the East Coast of Singapore",5.0,,"The breathing ""Green Lung"" of the East Coast of Singapore. During the end of year monsoon season (November to February), the constant on-shore breeze brings welcome relief to the humidity that is Singapore. The motor-vehicle traffic free PCN (Park Conector) that runs it's entire length, stretches all the way from near the Changi International Airport, right up to Marina Bay in the CBD - a distance of over 25km end-to-end. You can even continue on the island's easter PCN circuit and ride on cycle paths (traffic free) all the way to Ponggol Park in the North of the island, - a total distance of more than 95km end-to- end."
,,Bike ride,4.0,,Clean and safe cycling path. Toilets are clean too. A good day out with kids to keep active. Shades and benches for a rest. Some water dispensers would be good too.
,,Family outing,3.0,,"Overly crowded nowadays especially on weekends. On the plus side, you can rent bikes or skates from kiosks situated along the beach. The Marine Cove is a nice new chill out place with eateries like Mcdonalds and Coffee bean."
,,great outdoor day,4.0,,"can have bbq activity camping and cycling here, u will love this nature place and suit for all range of age there is a huge foodcourt and can have nice sea side view from here"
,,"Cycling, BBQ, beach",5.0,,"I always do family cycling at ECP. In general, most shops offer another hour free on a weekday. i do have below reviews of 3 bicycle shops:

1) Rental shop near Parkland Green, East Coast Park
Unfortunately i dont know the name. They do not have family bikes. However there is an option for Single adult with Baby seat at $15. Single bikes are $10 for 2 hours! Even though it was on a weekend(CNY PH). that's crazy cheap! The bikes are new, they provide mineral bottles for free! They mentioned its ok to return a little late and it was a very kind gesture. We did return on time though. Very excellent service and we will definitely return.

2) Rental shop at carpark C
Their typical family bike (sits 2 adults and 2 small kids) costs $30/hr which the bigger bikes (sits 4 adults and 2 small kids) costs $40/hr. Offering additional 1 hr free on a weekday. Staff are friendly and good. Generally round up the time so u can cycle longer.

3) Rental shop at carpark E2
The only shop that does not offer free 1 hour on a weekday. Bikes are older, staff are ridiculously rude. They are strict on enforcing penalty on the time rule, strict to the minute. which we would have gladly paid except we found out every other shop had additional 1 hr. It was hard to make it in time as the kids were tired and we had to spend a while to handle them, unfortunately the shop had to make us pay $60 for 1 hr +. Whatever family fun we had was destroyed thanks to them. So, avoid the stress, avoid the cost, avoid the place. that will do. It was ignorant and lack of checking that led us to this place. But never again"
,,"Idle, walk sit, cycle whatever.....",4.0,,"A automobile free stretch of close to 15 - 20 km along the sea is a rarity in this car infested world. East Coast park or ECP as it is called gives this and more. Great for a family outdoors experience with barbecue pits, camping grounds which need to be booked in advance. A great place for coup,es to tak that evening or a morning walk as the sun goes down or comes up.

Sundays during holidays tend to be crowded I patches but what the heck it just adds up to the atmosphere.

Worth a evening stroll or a ride."
,,Cycle into the city.,5.0,,"Great place to hire bikes and see Singapore from a different angle away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Great for families, well laid out with exciting play areas for children, eating and drinking places, BBQ places and areas for playing cricket etc."
,,What a lovely huge park next to the sea!!,4.0,,"I have never seen such a huge part which runs on the entire coast of Singapore for many kilometres. And most of it is natural. With lots of eateries and a huge children's park near Marine Cove, this becomes a very nice place to visit if you want to visit a non-tourist area. In fact, this park was recommended by a local friend of ours. Otherwise, it was not on our agenda earlier.

Tips/observations/points to remember:

1. How to reach - we took a bus and got down at Marine Crescent, Blk 45. From there we had to walk through a residential complex called Marine Crescent Ville towards East Coast Park Road. We had to then cross the East Coast Park Road through a long pedestrian tunnel which goes underneath the ECP Road and emerges straight into the park near the huge children's play area. This part of the park seemed to be the most happening with lots of eateries like McDonald's, Burger King nearby and Cycle Max from where you can hire cycles. When you get down at the bus stand you can see signage of the tunnel, you just need to follow those. This area is the Marine Cove area and as per our judgement seemed to be the most happening area of the huge park. Frankly, we would have covered just 10% of the park which is huge and runs along the coast.

2. Best is to go in the morning or evening. We went in the afternoon and got fried in the heat. But the park had lesser people. It is very hot in the afternoon. So, in case you go in the afternoon, you could carry umbrellas, for protection from the sun.

3. There are lots of eating joints and options. We went to McDonald's as we had a 6 year and a 14-year-old and you know how crazy they are about McDonald's. The Mcdonald's is at Marine Cove and is a huge one which is very nice. There are lots of other eateries in the same complex. We also noticed a Biryani joint.

4. What we did - frankly because of the heat we couldn't do anything much. We hired a 4 seating cycle which all 4 can pedal and we must have ridden some half a kilometre only before the heat got hold of us. You can hire all kinds of bikes from Cycle Max which is located nearby. Well, for locals this park seems to be the favourite to do barbeques. There are hundreds of barbeque counters which are already constructed and which you can book on the net. Each counter is numbered. All you have to do is get all the barbeque stuff and go to your booked counter and enjoy a barbeque. Well, we did not do anything of this sort. I just noticed this while researching on the park. There is a beach next to the park and you can go swimming in the sea. I think you need to get all your stuff like towels, etc. in case, you want to go into the sea. We didn't see any arrangement for that. You can also do skating, cycling, jogging, etc. There are lovely non-vehicular roads made all along the park where you can do all these activities. There is a huge children's park though you can do hardly anything much in the afternoon because of the heat.

In spite of the heat, we and our kids really enjoyed the visit to the park. I recommend this part to anybody staying near the East Coast Park and who has some spare time in hand."
,,"Singapore is an island after all, so there has got to be some beach!",4.0,,"The East Coast Park makes a very welcome contrast to built-up urban Singapore. I believe in total this park is 15 Kilometers long, so there is plenty of room for sports and recreation. Parallel to the coast runs a wide pavement split into a side for pedestrians and a side for cyclists and skaters. Locals do swim in the ocean, but I wouldn't recommend dipping into the brownish water foaming slightly! I am rating the Park here, and not the quality of the water. Visible just a few hundred meters out are lots of vessels waiting to enter the Singapore Harbour or waiting for new contracts. They seem like pearls on a string in darkness."
,,Pleasany,4.0,,"Walked along east coast a few times,very pleasant,seashore on one side,sand beach,joggers,cyclists etc along Road area next to walkers,very safe,plenty of restaurants,drink outlets,along length,does get very humid for some reason.only thing that spoils area,large numbers of tankers off coast."
,,My favourite weekend destination for fun and food,5.0,,"East coast park is near to the sea shore where we can see the beauty of sunset and the raising of moon. Best place for jogging and cycling. Water skating is available in the park at a minimum cost.
Beach is clean and safe for swimming. Coastguard patrolling is there for security purpose. The landing and takeoff of aeroplanes are able to see from east coast as the changi international airport is at one side of the sea shore. The ships anchored near to the east coast beach give a mind blowing view during night time. The lights from the ships resembles some kind of celebration.
The most important attraction is food- nearby food court is a food paradise. There are about 60-70 hawkers running variety of food stalls. Almost all international cuisines are available in that food court. Open air seating and the freshly cooked hot food with a chilled beer is sufficient to fill the stomach and mind of every visitors.
A must visit place in singapore."
,,A lovely place to walk during the evening,4.0,,"Although the city is very ' built up' and busy, this beach area is an alternative place to spend some time. An evening walk along the beach and a meal in one of the many restaurants is a pleasant change."
,,Best place for all ages to enjoy,5.0,,"Going to East Coast park is like few times in a month for us. Almost all the birthday parties in my friends circle happens there. Kids have a great time with wide range of activities. We even stay overnight sometimes and that's a wonderful experience.

The new children's playground is awesome and big and kids enjoy a lot. Cycling, Skating, Camping, Flying Kite, Volleyball, Swimming, Soccer, Fishing, Prawning, Cricket, Restaurants etc... there is a lot to do."
,,Relaxing walk by the sea,4.0,,"This is possibly the best place in Singapore to enjoy long walk along the beach and undoubtedly my favourite! I enjoy parking myself there at least one of the weekend evenings. There are huge selection for drinking and dining, from humble food court stalls and fast food joints to swanky upmarket cafes and eateries, including a famous sea food centre. Options are simply countless. When accompanied by my kids, we would rent bicycles and paddle along the long stretch of well lit bicycle path, which goes all the way to Marina barrage in the south. There are plenty of parking slots and the rates are reasonable."
,,Singapore's favorite haunt in the East,5.0,,"This is one of our fav spots and I'm sure for most Singaporeans as well.
We usually come here in the night after dinner, or in the morning, to get a bit of sunshine.
We would also park free at car park F2, where we walk either eastwards towards Sungei Bedok (Bedok river), or walk westwards towards the jetty or the famous East Coast hawker centre.
We sometimes park at car park B1, also free, if we want to walk the lower section of the park near Fort Rd. From here, one can walk westwards and reach even the Gardens by the Bay.
Definitely a great park, for any lover of walking, cycling or skating."
,,Lovely walk/camping/cycling by the beach,5.0,,The place is really beautiful. A must visit with family/friends for camping/outing/picnic. Lush green gardens along with the beach makes the place extremely beautiful.
,,One of the best beach park in Singapore,4.0,,This is probably one of the best beach one can get in Singapore. It's crowded on Saturday and a little less busy on Sunday. There are many activities to do here. One can rent a bicycle or roller blade with a dedicated lane for bicycle. Otherwise a jog or stroll along the dedicated jogging lane is good with a love ones.
,,"Beach, bikes and seafood",4.0,,We brought our kids there to see the sea and rented bikes so they could cycle there (very safe as there are tracks for that). Went to Katong nearby for lunch (or there is also the Parkway Parade Mall) and then had seafood for dinner on the beach. A good hotel to stay in for this would be the Mercure Grand Roxy.
,,A great day out with lots to do,4.0,,"A Sunday outing, coffee looking at the sea and watching the place so busy with people.
We rented a Tandem bicycle and rode the full length, one direction then the other, about 13 kms in all.
Beach is very average, but the activities are great.
Many restaurants all over but at the north end of the park, is a great food court with many many food stalls and free tables. Good value eating here, get some Satay sticks, grab a cold Tsing Tao beer and watch the world and the Sea go by.
All in all, a good day out."
,,Good place to Exicerize,3.0,,"I go to East Coast Beach area for exercise.
It is accessible by walk, bicycle and cars.
The site is currently under upgrade faze and many places are messy but still able to enjoy.
They completed some new restaurants site and children playground area last few years.
Sad things is maintenance is not good and it is already deteriorating.
Local seems to be do not care to take care the places so it getting bad every time we visit. I hope those taken care of public spaces should be taught as basic education during the young age since most of adults are behaving badly.
Place can be full of garbage due to such selfish people's actions and cheap foreign labors come and clean the place which I found very unethical.

I often see many Tai Chi, Yoga and meditation practitioners, Runner, Cyclists, Rollerblade and Long run events are happening often.
It has healthy vibe compare to the city center."
,,Good for a picnic,4.0,,"Great place to walk, bike, barbeque and picnic along the beach, esp in good weather ! There are eateries as well interspersed in the ECP."
,,"Lovely beach, beautiful park.",5.0,,"The beach is stunning and so is the park, ideal for a walk, swim or sunbathe.

There is a large green grass area and also coffee places.

We went for breakfast and had such a lovely few hours walking along the beach, and exploring the beautiful park.

If you are near by its a must for a trip in Singapore.

Get an uber there is probably easier than walking."
,,Excellent Stretch of Beach for a Great Stroll,5.0,,"This place is great for a nice afternoon / evening stroll and the beach is awesome. There are nice restaurants and the view is to die for... Can even do rollerblading, biking, barbecuing, etc..... All in all, a wonderful little corner of Singapore that can be visited again and again....."
,,Seabreezes / Food / Drink sand and miles of walkways / bikeways,5.0,,"I live in CDB and regular cycle along this route

Bike rental shops are along route - several new ones

Great sea breezes

Renowned food centres - lots to do - several renovations

Water sports - new wake Park - sailing too

Gets busy on Public Holidays

Wear a helmet"
,,Nice place to bike and walk,5.0,,Love this place for an early morning walk or a bike ride. In the evening it's filled with family with kids.
,,Not a tourist-y place or an essential part of Singapore.,2.0,,"Unlike its more visually stunning and well-known counterparts like Gardens by the Bay or the Singapore Botanical Gardens, the ECP has little to offer, even for locals like myself. Its really only a place to visit if you are staying in Singapore for quite some time, but even then there's not much to see or do. Your best bet is to rent a bike and cycle from one end of the park to the other - basically covering one quadrant of the island (you'll also end up at Changi, near the airport). The beaches are basically deserted because the water is so murky, so swimming is a no-no, and there isn't a whole lot of flora and fauna to make it worthwhile for nature lovers. At best, there is a newly constructed children's playground where Marine Cove used to be that could prove enticing for families with a long vacation here, but otherwise, don't put this in your list of ""must-do""s in Singapore."
,,Dont go here for the sea,3.0,,"The sea is not worth getting into in most places. We even saw plastic bags floating around. The Park, otherwise, is decent and quite crowded on weekends."
,,Not the best place in Singapore,3.0,,Only visit this place if you're in Singapore for long and have done all other attractions.. Sentosa is better.. This place is good for picnic and/or biking/roller blaing.. It's a long patch of sea running parallel to Marine Parade road..
,,Nice for a relaxing stroll,4.0,,"I was staying close to East Coast Park so I decided to visit on my last day in Singapore.

It was a Friday and the schools in Singapore had begun their end of year holidays so there were quite a few groups of school aged children at the park who looked as if they were on an organised outing as part of their 'out of school care' while their parents were at work.

I walked from Section B to Section C stopping on the way to have a sit down and look out to sea at the many ships anchored there. It was very hot, but luckily there were enough seats in the shade. I would imagine that on weekends it would be more difficult to find somewhere suitable to sit due to the crowds.

I arrived at a complex which housed a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf café, a few other local restaurants and a very big McDonalds, so I decided to have lunch at McDonalds.

It was absolutely packed with big groups of school aged children, however the queues moved very quickly and it wasn't long before I managed to find a seat outside where I could relax and eat my lunch.

I was very pleased to see that, in addition to the usual McDonald's hamburgers and fries, they also served ready made sandwiches and salads.

The thing that struck me is that Singaporeans seem to take every opportunity to get out and about with their families enjoying every parkland space which is available for recreation, and that's as it should be."
,,average place,3.0,,"its a fun place to visit with your friends and family for dining, chilling out and doing nothing....can do biking and skating as well.. ships across the sea ruin the fun"
,,"The Sun, Sand and Sea ... with Playground and Pub too!",4.0,,Just been there after the renovation of Marine Cove and the inclusion of a new play ground. Noticed a pub called 'Georges' with a live-band from the Philippines. A little loud and expensive with only Tiger and no Heineken served in a Jug! Overall the beach is still clean with nice breeze and broad cycling paths.
,,Nice hangout place,4.0,,Must weekend place for family.. food is delicious.. crab ia must try there.. orawn is also superb. Walk in the clean sea beach..
,,East Coast Park,4.0,,Nice place to cycle during weekends. Wonderful place for family to go to for a picnic. Can enjoy the sea breeze.
,,Beachfront park,4.0,,"This beachfront park is a favourite with locals. There are lots of restaurants, bars and cafe along the beachfront where you can sit and relax enjoying the sea breeze and watch cyclists, roller bladders, joggers and walkers while they exercise here."
,,Nice place for long walks,5.0,,"it is amazing outdoor space to walk, bike or roller blade. One of the top place for picnics along the shore. You can spend some quality time relaxing and spending time with the family and friends. It also offers long walks if you enjoy walking. There are a lots of restaurants along the way should you get hungry. One of my favorite place to come to relax and get fresh air in Singapore."
,,Wow! big and clean park!,4.0,,"From the airport, I took Bus 36 to go to my hotel located downtown. We passed by this park twice, picking up or discharging passengers. Noted the beach, trees, clean air, etc. Definitely going to visit this park during my brief stay in Singapore!"
,,Very Nice place to walk and enjoy local food,5.0,,"Visited the park during one of my recent visits to Singapore. It is amazing outdoor space to walk, bike or roller blade. You can see the locals having picnics along the shore, relaxing and spending time with the family and friends.You can walk quite a ways. There are a lots of restaurants along the way should you get hungry. Definitely one of my favorite spots to get some fresh air in Singapore.

Will be here again.."
,,"Nice, Relaxed Family Atmosphere",4.0,,"This is a nice place to visit for exercise or for food. There's a food place (we had satay) and it's right on the bay with ships anchored in the near distance. It's quite picturesque, clean and organised. Great place to have a nice, relaxed afternoon with family or friends."
,,The Haven for local population..,5.0,,"You won't find many tourists here. But the entire area is full of Singaporeans. This place has something for everyone.

Wholesome family fun, cycling, running, jogging, simply strolling in the evening by the sea, candy stalls, gourmet cuisine...You name it, and the park has it.

Not to be missed."
,,Nice place to chill out,3.0,,"Just a relaxing day by the beach, or one can bring a pet for a walk or even do some workout by renting a bicycle or just simply walk/jog away"
,,Pleasant,3.0,,A very pleasant place for morning/evening walks and bicycling. Bicycles are available on rent but quite crowded on weekends.
,,A Mesmerising Picnic Place,5.0,,"Tourists must make it a point, where possible, to go laze under the sun in this lovely long stretch of sheer beauty of greenery and coastal waters. It is the ideal place to unwind with family members and friends. So many things one can do at this park - rent bicycles and go on a journey to Marina Bay and take in the sights of our world-class Gardens by the Bay; or have a wonderful picnic time in this beautiful park; or watch your little ones play happily at the children's playground. The park's amenities are modern and user-friendly, including for the less-advantaged as well. The F&B outlets are plentiful and they provide delicious food and drinks, and the variety available means there's really no need for you to bring your own food to the park, unless you want to. It would be easy for you to get to know other folks there as they welcome the sharing and the making of new friends. Singapore has the sun the whole year round as it does not have the 4 seasons of temperate countries, so any time to be at the park is not a problem, except that December month tends to have more rainfall days than other months. For Singaporeans, however, rain or shine, the park is still a family paradise place."
,,Walk by the beach and seaside park,4.0,,"Morning or evening walk or jog would be very pleasant and scenic. This is one of the few places in Singapore where you could get close to the sea or even swim in it.
Scenic and peaceful sea views and you get to see the many ships anchored in the sea in the distance."

,,RELAXING,5.0,,A great place to relax and unwind .Riding a bicycle along the beach the best part for me . Good place to be with family or friends and be away from city
,,Peaceful place in Singapore,4.0,,"If you are bored with the high streets of singapore, you can go to East coast for a walk by the sea. Our Client arranged a dinner near the east coast beach overlooking sea. Its a peaceful and quite place for relaxing."
,,"Long stretch along the beach for walking, jogging, cycling or roller blading",4.0,,"It is a gem of a place where you can walk, talk, jog, run, cycle, roller blade or skate - all alongside the beach. Many pit stops to refuel yourself with food or drinks. Running for miles, it has an option and views of the water for all tastes and ages. Go have fun."
,,Always nice to ride or walk - lots of activity to observe & clean,5.0,,"Great to ride and either go to Pulau Ubin or back to the city over the barrage, great views of the ocean and ships, lagoon food centre is cheap but very tasty - a couple of great bars like Myras (friendly, ramshakle, good Sangria) or the bar on the wake ski lagoon (hip, funky, new)"
,,its ok,3.0,,"nice place to run and bike, fresh air but the water is not clear, brown, but the sorroundings is clean, nothing so special"

The park is also ideal for camping, barbecuing or picnics."
,,Calm away from the rush & bustle,4.0,,"We walked along the beach at East Coast Park and enjoyed the cool breeze off the ocean, the peaceful quietness. The area is well serviced with restuarants and hire shops. I think public transport is only available on weekends."
,,Barbecue Party at Its Best Location!!!,5.0,,"This is my #1 go-to place for activities like cycling, walking, and dining. It carries a lot of options for exercise buffs or those who just wants to sweat out while appreciating the sky, sand, and sea. There are rental shops for in-line skating and biking (solo, tandem, family bike). It is also ideal for camping, picnic, and celebrating parties or get-together with colleagues and friends. Very relaxing and soothing ambiance."
,,A park for everyone,4.0,,There's plenty to do at East Coast park. Just don't come on a weekend cos it gets really crowded at areas b and c. Many restaurants and bike rental shops. Very beautiful view of the sea.
,,Getaway from Busy world,5.0,,"This manmade beach is good for getting away from busy world.
Suitable for family picnic, BBQ party as well as for adults to hang out with friends.
Swimming area is not as good as Sentosa but still recommend this place for leisure and bbq ...
Lots of BBQ pit (but need to book through AXS Machine)
Can stay late at night.
Taxis are available until dawn.
Restaurants are there too..."
,,A nice place to be ... but maybe not for tourist,5.0,,"First of all, east coast park is not an isolated part, it stretches from east side (Changi airport) to central (business district) area. Your experience varies depending on where you visit. Personally I like to cycling around the coastline, it's an unbelievable and relaxing experience (considered the crowded and stressful life in Singapore).

For tourist, considering your time (in singapore) is limited, i would not recommend this place for you, Garden by the Bay may be more suitable for you."

,,Lots of bikes to rent and plenty of restaurants,3.0,,"Coming from Aus and being around some beautiful beaches - I cant really give east coast park high marks because of the beach... I wouldnt get in that water if you paid me. However the walk is lovely, and you can rent a bike and ride up to Changi village. It's a good way to spend a day and get in some exercise.

Jumbo is along the walk as it the lagoon food court which has some great satay and cheap beer. I love this place for a Sunday rest day"
,,Working out Haven,4.0,,"Great place to have a picnic with the family. They have gazebos and bbq pits. You could also pitch tents and spend the night there. The bike lane is superb. The beach is ok, didn't tried swimming though."

There are lots of lovely restaurants. This is a place to be visited in the evenings."
,,Good place to enjoy your sunset,4.0,,The place has got some scenic beauty in all of Singapore with greenery of the east coast park and ofcourse not to forget about the Sea. Palm treesm coffee shops everywhere and if you are a cyclist you can enjoy one hell of a ride through the long stretch of east coast park.

,,Cooling Walk,5.0,,"Love to walk along ECP in the evening to enjoy the breeze while look around at other people cycling, skating, scooting, camping, bbq-ing. It is somewhere to unload our usual urban lifestyle and allowing us to blend into nature more."
,,A lovely sunset and walk!,4.0,,"A lovely walk from Myra's Beach Club to the Hawker markets! Lots of activity here picnics, bike riding etc."
,,Nice Coast to While off a DAy,4.0,,"Had been there in August. Weather was pleasant and also the Beach. Not a Proper beach where you can happily have a Sun BAth, but good enough to give rest to the tiring Muscles. Can Hire a Bicycle and cycle across the park. Worth doing it. Good Food, Especially if you are a Sea Food Lover. Nice Fish and Chips......:).
Good For kids to be playing around."
,,Good for walking,4.0,,"The east coast park is suitable for early morning jogging or a lazy stroll in the evening. Or, for a BBQ with friends and family. We thought that the beauty of it was ruined to some degree by all those cargo ships waiting in line for the port."
,,Peaceful morning walk,4.0,,"After a morning walk along the bay, we also had a delicious local breakfast such as nasi lemak and coffee at there. A peaceful and relaxing place!"
,,Nice Evening Walk,3.0,,"Had a great meal at one of the restaurants and then a nice evening walk. Lovely way to relax after the heat of the day. Downside, it was a bit too dark so a little more lighting would have been helful. Also waited longer than anticipated for taxi back to city."
,,"Biking, camping, picnics and more",5.0,,"The East Coast park has a number of stations to rent bikes for an affordable rate! You can ride for hours up and down the entire east coast of Singapore. There are also nice areas to hang out on the beach, pitch a tent for camping, or rent barbeque pits for a picnic. Great for friends, families, couples, everyone! Very scenic and lovely for a nice active day."
,,More for people-watching than the surf and the sand,3.0,,"It's not a very scenic beach, that's for sure. It is however one that Singapore had for decades and had been seared into the memories of many generations of Singaporeans. It is not the Gold Coast or even a Desaru. After all, how can it deservingly be a beach if what you see are the tankers in the distance and the occasional trash from the ships.

That's why it's not called a beach, but a park! Come here to see families spending time together cycling or BBQing. A place where Singaporeans and foreign workers come together to spend their weekends and enjoy really their friends' and family's company."
,,Nice outing,4.0,,"We visited the East Coast Park beach just to relax. Its a nice place. We hired a family cycle and took a small bike tour. There are lots of people jogging, roller blading and cycling. Its a good place to have a picnic."

,,Nice part of singapore,5.0,,When you want to be by the beach and relax. Wonderful space. Nice to go on bike rides when not busy.
,,Nice city park to relax & get away from usual city life,5.0,,"Eating/pit stops are spread along the park, very far apart. Therefore, please plan where to start and bring along water with you if you plan to walk/cycle/skate long.

There are fastfood restaurant area, seafood restaurant area and hawker centre area, all far apart, long long walk.

The park is more than 15 kilometres.

To leave the park, call a taxi or Uber/GrabTaxi because it is difficult to flag for one there.

Weekends are crowded. Weekdays are almost empty.

You can rent bicycle and rollerskates if you want.

Bring a mat if you want to picnic.

Have a good day."
,,Many activities and nice night scene,5.0,,"This is probably the longest stretch of beach in Singapore for walks, Swimming, Cycling, jogging, roller blading, gathering, picnics and BBQ. There are many food outlets along the stretch with numerous and ample parking. A placed filled with people in the day and particularly crowded during public holidays.
The evenings are slightly less bustling and quieter but no less people. The night scene is filed with lights from the ships anchored at the Eastern anchorage and you get to see the planes making their descent in towards Changi Airport. The breeze can be coming from the sea or outward from inland. Nice place to just dig and watch the skies."
,,Great cycling place in SIN,4.0,,"We stayed in expo which the hotel has bicycle for cycle, we did a morning cycle toward East coast park which we found the park has good seashore view plus very nice place for cycling.
You can see the aircraft on n off here n I think it already a relaxing place in Singapore."

,,A getaway from the hustle,4.0,,"The scenery is beautiful. There isn't much to do here but you can enjoy a quiet, peaceful afternoon here, cycling, swimming, sunbathing, reading - just whatever you want. And you will certainly feel relaxed in this place."
,,Great family outdoor destination!,5.0,,"With over 15km of beach, park and recreational facilities, there is so much to do and explore at the beautiful #EastCoastPark! The largest park in #Singapore, be sure to stop and enjoy the newly built #MarineCovePlayground, a fully decked out playground including a massive 3-story #climbingstructure! ✨So much fun!✨ This is a great destination for meals as the playground is situated adjacent to a section of restaurants and eateries. ☕️Hot coffee, snacks and yummy food while the kids run, swing, climb and play, what an awesome way to spend an afternoon/evening #outdoors in Singapore! @kidsonthego"
,,East Coast Park,4.0,,"Great place for a picnic.
With panoramic views of Singapore.
White sand and blue sea.
You can sit on the sand and look over Sentosa and the fantastic huge ships sitting out on the ocean waiting to unload their goods at port.
If you dont want to have a picnic there are loads of places to eat and drink
Restaurants that sell amazing seafood although it not cheap but plenty of food to choose from.
If your on a budget there is a Hawker Centre selling local and Western food soft drink beer and ciders at a reasonable price.
There are bicycles and roller blades for hire and you can skate or cycle along the long promenade.
Its very safe and great for kids.
A great day out and a great place to relax.
It could be cleaner as there now seems to be people living in tents in some parts of the beach...but overall not to be missed."

There's lots of restaurants too."
,,day and night trips,5.0,,"I recommend day trip. Safe place to have BBQ, although you have to make a reservation of the BBQ pit in advance. Safe place for riding bicycle and kids playing their own bikes or 2 wheel balancing device or even skating. There are restaurants near the old lagoon. Ask the people there and you get your way there."
,,Fun bike track,5.0,,"Loved how the scenery changed from beach to greenery along the path.. Nice to try, especially after you got bored of all the malls."
,,Great place to spend the day,5.0,,"We took bicycles on rent and explored the whole place. It has great barbeque stations and beach too. Very calm and good place to go with the family or alone. Good food and coffee options too. Kids will also enjoy playing in sand, bicycling, skating or just playing in the grass."
,,Need to visit spot,5.0,,"Ive lived for about 6 month in the Calypso which is 5 mins walk from this spot. Went here every morning or arvo to get some workout moments. Many food stalls, outdoor gym equipment are also provided."
,,Lotsa of restaurants,4.0,,"Although the sand/beach is not as clean as it is in Sentosa, there are some good spots where you can just lay down and suntan. I quite enjoyed my experience at East Coast park as there are an extremely wide variety of things you can do there. You can rent bikes or roller blades. There is also prawning near by, and you can also paddleboard! Basically a lot of things you can do. There are also many restaurants along the beach and even a local hawker centre known for it's good oyster omelette and chicken wings! Near the hawker centre, there is also a wakeboarding place. There are also fancy seafood restaurants near the hawker centre. You can cycle to Changi or Marina Bay Sands from East Coast Park depending on where you go. It is family friendly, and definitely worth a visit during the weekends or when it's sunny!"
,,Excellent place not known,4.0,,"A paradise for walkers, bikers, runners etc .. you can do all activities and enjoy the sea view, its a wonderful , long and well maintained walkway.. definitely a must do if you are an adventurous one.."
,,Something For Everyone,4.0,,"Singapore's East Coast Park is a 15 km strip of reclaimed land running from Singapore City all the way down the south east coast.

It consists of many parks with tall tropical trees, gardens, water features and lawns, bicycle tracks, pedestrians walkways, running tracks, skate board ramps, and fishing points.

It is also interspersed with restaurants, coffee shops and smaller shopping malls.

My Singaporean host on this visit told me that some countries, like Vietnam and Laos have put a ban on further sales of sand, which is used for the land reclamation, because of the ecological damage it is causing to their own countries."
,,Really relaxed - cheap bike rental,4.0,,"Visited the park on a Sunday lunch time - had a leisurely stroll down the walk way and found a shaded spot under some trees to relax. Kids all hired bikes for one hour at the cost of 6 dollars. Pretty reasonable

We then found a very pleasant cafe for lunch.

Well worth a visit for a cost effective family day out"
,,Soft Afternoon,5.0,,Suitable place to go for a walk or go fish with ur children.l had a nice seafood type dinner in there.
,,Biggest beach in Singapore,5.0,,"Enjoy a bicycle ride along the breezy beach, it has food along the way to fill your stomach when hungry, there is a park near bedok jetty for skateboarders and cyclist to perfect their skill."
,,Lovely ambience,5.0,,"An excellent location to take a long walk along the sea front, hire a bicycle, eat sea food and simply hangout!"
,,Great chilled out Park,5.0,,"We came here to get away from the hustle and bustle of the City and the expense too!

We hired bikes for a few hours and cycled around the park in its large cycle lanes .. our girls loved it (age 13&11)... but so did we, as gave us decent family time!

You can BBQ at the park too and many of the locals were all having mini BBQ parties going on too (we were there on a Sunday afternoon).

Many restaurants are in the park too but would recommend carrying a cab number with you as there does not seem to be a cab/taxi rank close by.

Definitely recommend to go and also hire the bikes too (just don't forget ID...they need this to hire the bikes whether this be a passport or driving licence!)"
,,Hire a bike and head East towards Changi to leave the crowds behind,4.0,,"East Coast Park is a long, beach-side set of lungs for the busy City, with plenty of places to eat and things for children and families to do. It is well laid out and maintained, with walking paths separated from cycle ways, and well maintained with plenty of small gardens and lakes. However, because there aren't too many open air places like this in Singapore, it gets crowded, very crowded at weekends and holiday times. It also might be beach-side, but you can't swim - with all the ships moored off-shore it is polluted and, as reclaimed land, the beaches are all artificial and slope steeply very close to shore. Try hiring a bike from the many hire stores, about $8 for 2 hours, and head towards Changi. It's a pleasant ride, but go for a leisurely 45 minutes or so and you will leave all the facilities behind and, along with them, most of the people. It becomes a very different world - quite peaceful."
,,Good but crowded on weekends,4.0,,"Nice to cycle (you can rent there), walk, run, work out... Enjoy the sunset or the sunrise. Lots of options for food. Commute is a little bit hard, as there is not enough taxi nor buses to leave the place."
,,outdoor beach feeling,5.0,,"rent a bike, roller-skates or stool along east coast park to catch singaporean outdoor beach live in a bustling atmosphere. Great cafes, kid playgrounds, skate park, futsal or sailing or just a family bbq at one of the many bbq stalls"
,,Good for strolling,4.0,,"not much things to see. good for strolling and bicycling, rollerblading etc or catching fishes. lots of good food though."
,,Beach,5.0,,This is the beach front the locals go to. Yes everyone is welcome. It is interesting to see how different cultures do when they go to the beach. They have picnics and enjoy large family get together's. You will not see people in a scantly dressed swim suits. They have bikes you can rent to enjoy your ride down the coast. The sunrise here is worth waking up for. It is close to the airport so the number of flights coming in is mind boggling. You will see the large number of ships waiting to unload their cargo there. The West Coast is the side for that.
,,Place for breezy,5.0,,"East coast park is one of my favorite in Singapore...I love to go with my friends at least once in a month.No entrance fees...good for camping,BBQ pit,kiting,and fishing...nice food stalls to try local as well western food.Good to have night stay ..by camping.No need to pay for camping as well but you need to get your permit of free stay from the Nation park Singapore web site. you can get it from AXS station as well. Its also good for cycling,skating and tricycle ride."
,,A beautiful morning walk,5.0,,A lovely place for a morning walk along the bay. The number of locals participating was a sure recommendation. The best children's playground that I have come across well appointed places to eat or drink and numerous seats to just relax
,,Good place for camping and relaxing,4.0,,"I would say, if you want to spend time with your family or friends place visit this beach, this beach little far away from downtown, but worth visiting at least once. You can camp here, chit chat with friends and many more. And yes food, you can find lot of cuisine here."
,,A park for the locals,4.0,,I have lived next to the park for all together 14 years. The basics are still the same: lanes for bikes and runners / walkers that come to have a good exercise or stroll away from the crowd. There are different line-ups of cafes and restaurants but nothing spectacular. You can also enjoy water sports here but the quality of the beach and cleanness of the water are suspicious given the proximity to the buys ports nearby.
,,FOOD galore,5.0,,"I've always loved this place for its vibe and food. It's awesome, great with family, friends and even overseas colleagues. A great selection of a variety of Asian food - yummy and tasty. First time I'd tried the 'stingray' surprisingly very good."
,,Great place for a dog walk,4.0,,"I regularly walk our dog along ECP and really enjoy it in the morning. Nice view along the coast, lots of wildlife and the beach is generally well looked after. Occasionally after a big storm there can be a lot of rubbish on the beach, but not much anyone can do about that. Can get busy on the weekend and public holidays."
,,Great Pokemon Hunt,4.0,,"This is absolutely a great place to hunt for Pokemon !
There are many cafes around the corner and it's good for family members to enjoy their meals or friends just to chill out.
You can find free WIFI at some cafes and you can have a relaxing afternoon enjoying a cuppa coffee."
,,Relaxing and fun,4.0,,"Cycle, rollerblading, skating or jogging, there are so many activities one can do by the beach. Many dogs lovers walk their dogs here, enjoying the breeze and people watching"
,,For a getaway in the weekend with kid,4.0,,A good place for a stroll and getaway with family. Simple family activities and just kill your time on the shade with cool wind.
,,Cycling or BBQ,4.0,,"Man made beach and park for cycling, bbq and camping. You can book the chalet if you are not camping type. Jogging along the beach also nice."
,,Relaxing Walk,5.0,,"Lovely place to go for a stroll or jog or run..what ever your needs,lots of trees for shade and food outlets along the way."
,,A Park for everyone,5.0,,"What do you want to do - Bike, run, skate, sit by the beach, chase frisbee, play ball, go camping, cook BBQs, have dinner with friends? There's always something for you at EC.

Commute can be tricky though, I know cause we got lost once or twice trying to get there. There are only so few bus route that goes directly there. Since you'll need to cross ECP, best bus stop is Opp St. Patrick's Sec School (beside Singlap Park Connector)."
,,sunday,4.0,,"decent spot to spend you weekend or holiday for a few hours perhaps, gets hot in the afternoons though"
,,Best Public Park in South East Asia,5.0,,"This park is perfect to all whom is visiting Singapore. It's a massive beautiful park by the ocean, full of matured trees and flowers. Visitors can also rent a bike as low as $6 / hour to enjoy cycling throughout the park.

It shows the govt have put a lot of thought into this place. Kudos!

Ps- bring a food basket and go picnic"
,,A nice place for some outdoor low-key activities,4.0,,"It's a nice place to stroll by the coast, drive a bike, play some outdoor games, have a picnic or just chillax by the sea. There a stores and a shopping mall near by if you need to buy food and drinks. This spot is good both for solo and an afternoon out with friends or family. I have seen some people taking a swim. Although it is said it is safe to swim there, I was reluctant to do so as there were at least 80 tankers and big ships that were anchored or moving near the coast, and they do not spew out daisies. Stil, if you do decide to cool off and go for a swim, it certainly won't kill you."
,,Lovely day out,5.0,,"We hired bikes and cycled around the park. Lovely scenery, bike rental was really cheap. It was 12 dollars for an hour and you get another hour free. Book taxis in advance, as we waited half an hour to flag one down."
,,Safe outdoor park with lots of activities,5.0,,"This is a great park with separate running/walking and cycling paths, frequent food outlets and the ability to hire bikes to explore further. There are also playgrounds, picnic areas and plenty of shelters (for when the unexpected storm comes through!) along the way. A majority of the park is bordered by the ocean so it's a nice view for you to enjoy the outdoors."
,,Nice cool beach with no worries for food !,5.0,,"You can camp and have BBQ, picnics. You need to apply for a licencse which cost around $10 . All the BBQ pits are ready made so you just need to buy your own food and staffs."
,,Best place to ride a bike but the staffs of Bikestop spoil tge fun.,1.0,,"The place is nice, environment also nice and it would be safe to say that it is the perfect spot to ride a bike and enjoy the evening but you should be mentally prepared to experience the really bad service of the staffs of the Bikestop.
It would be great if you could bring along your own bicycle or just walk along the river and enjoy the seafoods and coconut or sugercane at the large foodcourt in the area."
,,If you like it simple.,5.0,,"East Coast Park , many activities ranging from skating, kit flying, bicycling. Fishing. Plenty of resturants the whole family can enjoy a day at the beach ."
,,Newly opened park is awesome,4.0,,Visited the park apparently the second week it has been opened. Park was fun and there's plenty of restaurants there. Family friendly.
,,My local hangout,4.0,,"Love coming here 2 or 3 times a week for a bit of running and cycling. Great place to bring the family, meet friends for a BBQ and be on the beach. Many people learn how to cycle here though or like to walk in the middle of the cycling path so be aware."
,,Good Physical Activity,3.0,,"Our family of four visited on Sunday evening. A very lively place. We had a combination of Bicycle hiring, jogging and sitting on the beach. Could not get family bicycle cart as they were all rent d out. One of few places where one can relax without paying high cost.

As a tourist commuting is tough. Getting a Taxi is almost impossible so had to take a bus for return journey. Our phone data was not working so could not call Grab or Uber. Could not find free WiFi zone."
,,Fun cycling from East Coast to Flower Dome via Marina Barrage.,5.0,,"I took the train to Mountbatten mrt station, exit B and then took a bus down Mountbatten Road and alighted near Arthur Road. Walking along Arthur road, I reached Katong Park where there is an underpass to East Coast Park. Exiting from the underpass, one can see a bicycle Kiosk (9 am to 8pm). Weekday rental of bicycle at $8 per hour includes another free hour. The bicycles are all very new.
From there, one can easily cycle along the flat cycle track to Marina Barrage and then to Garden By the Bay.
In good weather, this ride would be very enjoyable."
,,East coast park,5.0,,Fantastic place for family outing or with friends. Good for walking or cycling and also has good eating outlets. Not to be missed.
,,A Great Park,5.0,,"A real mix of activities available here. Bike hire, roller blading, skate parks, kids play found, BBQ stations, casual dining and lots of space to run around and play games. A thoroughly enjoyable visit."
,,Nice lazy outings with family,4.0,,"Great place to unwind with your family over the weekend, with lots of walking trails, eateries and barbecue areas."
,,Not really worth the visit,2.0,,"The only truly dirty place we could locate in Singapore.
An early morning bike ride took us along this beach. And it was a bit disappointing to see all the garbage, mostly non-biodegradable junk washed ashore, and the oil slick. Singapore really takes your expectations high in terms of cleanliness, and this place was a disappointment."
,,"Nice, big park in the east of Singapore",4.0,,"Though quite far from city and not near to MRT, this big park is a must go. Got some children playground, McDonald, Burger King, restaurants, kid fishing, BBQ place, camping ground, pond, etc. Can rent bicycle, scooter or roller blade as well. Kids would love this place. Too bad that got quite a lot of garbage in the sand."
,,"Great place for walking, cycling, or just hanging out",5.0,,"Beautiful views, clean grass with separate travel ways for walking vs cycling/skating. Family oriented. Many restaurants, adequate public toilets, etc. Only negative was trash on the beach from the many ships offshore."
,,cycle-run-sit-swim-party-chill-relax,5.0,,"This city and its Public places are at its best. Visited East coast park Solo..had a long stroll around the A block stretch..... Lot of Barbecue pods you can see, it can be pre- booked and used. They have a cycle rent stations. People were running,cycling along the dedicated pathways. Some were having barbecue party... singing their heart out on guitar strings. Some were just sitting on the sand watching the waves, some were swimming the sea. Totally happy public place."
,,PARK With Alot of activities,4.0,,"As i stay near by the East coase park just 15min drive from my house. The best thing Eastcoast is that you have tons of activities from eating to cycling, swimming, Jogging, Fishing, Scatting and nicr play grounds for children's. I went as usual with my family and enjoyed alot and tried newly introduced MCD @ Marine Cove was good experince must try."
,,Vibrant & Clean Park,5.0,,"The park was packed with people on a Public Holiday and we could see happy faces everywhere. There were people cycling , scooting, playing frisbee /Badminton, having picnic or camping and it was indeed a vibrant park!

The new playground at Marine Cove was super packed with children and their caregivers! I didn't expect it to be that crowded. My daughter was quite disappointed that she couldn't play there because we didn't want to risk her getting all sorts of virus such as HDMD from others.

We had dinner at babalicious located at Marine Cove and sat at the outdoor area overlooking that playground. While waiting for desserts, we realised that the crowd at the playground started to get lesser as it was getting dark and we decided to let her play for a while there. She was overjoyed. The good thing about dining and sitting outdoor at Marine Cove is that you get to see the playground from where you sit. Kids can wander off to the playground after they're done with their meals while adults can continue to chat at the table.

Generally, the park is still as clean as ever and there are many food choices too. There are bicycle kiosks for people to rent bikes as well. At the other side of the park, there's prawning and longkang fishing activities too. We also saw 'Diggersite' as we drove along the park. It's a make-believe site for kids to have role-plays by operating on machinery such as crane at the make-believe construction site. We didn't try it this time round and may do it the next round.

All in all, East Coast Park is indeed a wonderful recreational place for the young and old!"
,,Good place to run,5.0,,Spent many a Saturday morning at Parkrun here and Singapore Aquathlon . Great area fro running walking or biking and grateful for the outside showers at the toilet blocks
,,Lovely area with several Crab and sea-food restaurants .,5.0,,"Perfect area to enjoy a stroll and end up dinning at one of the best sea-food restaurants, e.g., Jumbo Restaurant, but book early. Excellent food but pricey . A must for the food -lover!"
,,Relaxed place with fresh morning air,5.0,,Had gone there for morning walk and the place is very nicely kept with lots of fellow morning walkers/ joggers/ cyclists. There are some good places to eat aswell after your stroll and maybe one can take a dip in the water aswell
,,Good for an evening walk and family day out,4.0,,This place comprises of a beach and a park. The park is well decorated and a semi clean beach. This place is near to the metro station Pasir Ris; bus and taxis are also available. Good for an evening walk and family day out
,,Vibrant atmosphere!,4.0,,"The ECP is a 15km+ stretch of beach, reachable via taxi or bus (also available from Bedok interchange). Its a good, FREE place to hangout, with ample seating spaces lining the beach if you do not fancy spreading a beach mat on the sand. BBQ pits and shelters are available for small parties. There is even a Hawker food centre. The best part though is the bike rental. Post sunset the place comes alive with cyclists, skaters and skateboarders zipping by with LED-adorned gear. Great spot for a weekend picnic."
,,I would Prefer Changi Beach,3.0,,"One of the more popular beaches in Singapore of course, but I feel the scenic views and the beaches are not very exciting. It can also get rather crowded. But the beach is very clean and I feel that is important.
However, I would much prefer Changi Beach, so you might want to try that one out instead."
,,Hire a bike!,5.0,,"We spent an hour riding along the Parkway and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, the scenery and the opportunity to ride on a safe thoroughfare. Love it!"
,,Perfect place for a family day out,5.0,,"We spent quality time as a family with our toddler.Beautiful and spacious.If you travel with a toddler,you can spend time at the beach in toddler friendly activities such as playing with sea waves,collecting sea shells,running along the beach and making sand castles.You can rent bikes and also you can enjoy good food there."
,,Dirty beach is not a good sight,3.0,,"In a city where one imaginably can eat of the floor of a public train this beach that was not too far from our hotel was a utter disappointment. It does not deserve the name ""beach"" at all.

Rubbish lined it - from plastic bottles to larger pieces of furniture and whilst the park seems to be popular it could do with a upgrade for sure - and a big, big clean up.

However - if one wants to have a look at a huge number of ships - its a nice spot..."
,,Excellent Place for Weekends,5.0,,This park is very good for cycling. Its 21km sketch gives you a complete view of the singapore while cycling along the beach and its very refreshing.
,,Perfect place to relax!,4.0,,"The best time to go east coast would be afternoon around 4ish. We hired bicycle for 2 hours and went around the whole area, it was so nice! You will see people of different ages, walking, jogging, cycling, playing, fishing and swimming in the beach. As it was a weekend we saw few people doing BBQ. It was a very nice and relaxing day!"
,,Good for Fishing Trip,4.0,,"Was there with a few friends for a fishing trip. Was there early and quite some spots available. The only irritating thing is that there are only very few shelters and normally is taken up. There will also be those regulars who are there and their hand line is always there which is quite selfish. Some uncles will try to sell u hooks and etc and there's a auntie selling drinks there. Overall, it's still a good place for friends to chill out and have a good tan while fishing."
,,Best spot for cycling,5.0,,Ecp is now connected to the city via marina barrage so you can spend hours cycling by the shore from changi village to gardens by the bay. Try to avoid public holidays as it gets extremely crowded.
,,Avg,3.0,,"Good tracks to run , cycle and skate. Good spot to barbeque and picnic with family and friends. But the sea is not clean around this area so wouldnt recommend sea bathing or playing in the sand."
,,Pleasant and Serene,4.0,,This place is quite clam and serene and good for walks and cycling !. You can definitely spend few hours gazing at the sea and lying idle
,,East Coast,3.0,,"East Coast Park is our local beach retreat area. The beach is from Fort Road to Bedok Jetty. Many big vessels docked outside our waters.

People go there to swim, jog, dog walk, cycle, bbq, camping, canoeing, boating, etc. People fishing at Bedok Jetty.

There are many restaurants and café at few spots on this beach. The few spots are (1) Big Splash, (2) East Coast Seafood Centre, (3) Lagoon Hawker Centre and (4) Parkland Green.

Occasionally can also see sand castle by the beach. Nice place to witness the majestic sun rise.

To get there. Take any bus (16, 3q, 36, 135, 196, 197, 401) to Marine Parade Road and walk through the few underpasses to get there."
,,"Fresh air, cycling path, plenty of good restaurants",4.0,,"Not too far from the centre of Singapore, it's a breath of fresh air (literally) and a really nice place to just go for a walk under the trees, looking out over the water (try and ignore the long line of oil tankers parked offshore though). It's not a good place to swim and there are not cafes every 5 minutes, so make sure you have water with you. There are a number of places with many good seafood restaurants, which are also worth visiting."
,,Pleasant visit,4.0,,"Rented a bike at Cycle Max and spent the late morning riding around. Lunch at East Coast Lagoon Food Village. There are places to swim along the park, but the beaches are filthy."
,,Horizon Covered in Boats,5.0,,"I love going to East Coast Park with my visitors. I drive them there on a weekday and we just sit and stare at the beautiful water and the boats all lined up. I usually count about 110-120 in view. East Coast Park is also great for eating, biking, walking, or having a picnic. There is a lot to do and it's a beautiful stretch of park land. It's high on my list of making sure I take people there mainly because it's so unique with the boats."
,,beautiful fun place,5.0,,"visited with friend and kids. A memorable experience with kids had great fun at the beach , played in water, made sand castles and did bike ride after ages. It was great fun exploring the area on the bike which is available for hiring for 8-10 SGD. bikes for all ages and sizes are available. A swimming costume and an extra change of clothes would be useful to carry. The food area is good and sugarcane juice is the best drink to try on a hot day. This visit is one of the best things to do while visiting Singapore."
,,CYCLING AT ITS BEST...,4.0,,"We rented bicycles for a few hours here and had a super new experience.... Cycling by the coast was great despite the heat.. Quiet, peaceful and a huge picnic place...."
,,Nice place to chill and relax,3.0,,"I grew up on the East side of Singapore and have many fond memories of this place. The sand is not very clean and there are many shady figures camping out here at night. Come here during the day to visit and it's nicer. Bring your roller blades, bikes and skateboards. Or you can also rent one from the many sports rental stores here but you need an ID card. There is also a place where you can go wakeboarding too. Peaceful and quiet place to hang out."
,,Great relaxation at East Coast,5.0,,"Go to the east Coast, take a bus or taxi and stroll on the beach, visit the hawker centre at th Lagoon, grab a bite at the many restaurants and bars on the sea side, great relaxing day, have a swim, there are plenty public showers and toilets to change back into dry cloths, great day out for all, very popular with us residents here in the East."
,,Nice Place for Family Activities,4.0,,"East Coast Park is located in the east side of Singapore and i was recommended by my friend. It is a nice place for family activities - Cycling, Roller-Blading, lazing by the beach, Picnic and a nice dinner at some of the F&B spots near this park."
,,Walk by the Beach,4.0,,"Morning time Sunrise is awesome , you really love Sun rise , the Sun water and the sand. Although it is not advisable to enter into water but still can enjoy a long beach walk , cycling trac and jogging tracks are also there to do cycling and jogging"
,,Family Place for Outing,4.0,,A great place for family to visit on a weekend. Cycling options available for enthusiasts. Else a walk on the road can be really relaxing. A great place for picnic to bring stuff and enjoy as a group. 7/11 nearby can be used for getting some cool drinks if you are thirsty or need a beer to chill out. Restaurant choices are there if you are willing to walk along the coast and explore options. Kumbo Sea Food or Myras Beach Club are few known options Overall a good place to spend a couple of hours
,,Well-Maintained Public Park,5.0,,"Came here on a Sunday evening and it was crowded. Saw several groups of people preparing barbecue and heaps of picnic going on. A lot of people cycling and roller skating. There were stores for snacks, drinks and food as well as a First Aid Center. There was a long stretch of beach open for volley ball, swimming etc, no water sports though. There was a place for prawning too. A very nice park to hang out at."
,,An eatery heaven,5.0,,There are so many places to eat here. It is a great spot to go in the evening and seek out your favourite meals. The food is very good and is cheap too.
,,East coast park Singapore,5.0,,"That's a beauty again The sea the park and the express way
The east coast park has these
Cycling tracks
Jogging walking tracks
Camping sites
Fitness point
Senior citizen fitness points
Rental - bicycle roller skates
Eating shops sports shops etc
But mind you keep clean"
,,Not bad..best place to cycle,4.0,,"We rented 4 four cycle's for 3 hours and ride across the east coast park. Surprisingly, it's a long ride couldn't believe we rode 30 KM's. I never thought east coast park cycling track is that much long."
,,"Nice pathway for cycle, jog or walk",4.0,,"This park/pathway runs for about 10 Km along the beachfront alongside the east Coast Parkway. I usually cycle with relatives from Singapore on a borrowed bicycle, but there are bike rental stations at both ends. You are on a path the whole way, so no need to worry about vehicle traffic. Plenty of other cyclists, joggers and walkers, so there's always someone to say hi to, or even help if in trouble.
There's a hawker centre at the eastern end near Changi/ferry area, with plenty of good, cheap food. I usually get some nasi lemak here, and then do the return trip back to town.
Singapore has some great urban planning, and this park/pathway is an example of that. I try to do it every time I come"
,,Top nature places to go in Singapore besides Botanic Gardens and Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"If there's any park that you want to visit in Singapore, East Coast Park would be among the most highly recommended together with the Botanic Gardens and Gardens by the Bay.

However, East Coast is distinctively different from the other two Gardens because of its sea-side location. The sand on the beach will never be as soft and smooth as those from other countries, but it has everything else you expect from a beach-side park - picture the warm sea breeze, families on picnic, teenagers on rented bicycles, and the like.

Tip: ECP is a linear strip along the banks of the beach. The quieter spots in East Coast Park are towards the two end of the Park where its less crowded and more peaceful."
,,"Best place to run, bike and to EAT!!!",5.0,,Me and my girlfriend went running here somedays and the stretch of the park is wonderful. Hired Bikes and went all the way close to the Marina. Much needed before we dug into the delicacies thats available at East Coast! Loved It.
,,Best park in Singapore for cycling!,5.0,,"I live near East Coast and love cycling along the coast and the park. It has a wide bike road, so even when it gets crowded, you are not accompanied by people all the time. East Coast id great for running as well, especially in the evenings. Nice area to take a walk and relax. Although the view are not very nice - you face the thousands of ships on the see, which always reminds you that you;re actually in town, not at the seaside."
,,long beach,5.0,,"You could cycle and enjoy the outdoor in this long stretch beach/park, or you could just jog of walk along the walk path."
,,Lots of activities,4.0,,"You will see lots of different activities available to people, plenty of shade to rest. lots of restaurants and cafes."
,,Great for a breather!,5.0,,Lovely view and a wonderful respite away from the hustle and bustle of city life. The water has never been cleaner!
,,lovely and peaceful,4.0,,This was across the road from our hotel and was lovely to get out and go for a walk and let the kids stretch their legs.
,,Nice place for family/ friends get-together,4.0,,"Shady park by the beach. Great place for family day-out. Barbecue, cycling, walking, jogging, camping."
,,Relaxing evening,5.0,,Went to the east coast park a couple of times during my business trip in Singapore. Excellent place to relax after a busy day at work.
,,great day out,4.0,,"you can do so much at ecp- walk, bike, skate, chill, bbq, shame some restaurants are gone but hopefully some new ones will replace them"
,,Love to love this place,5.0,,"This is a peaceful, noisy, quiet, Adventourus, name it and it can be that place.. The wide length offers all kind of atmosphere.. But it does offer a relax atmosphere no matter where you come from ."
,,Running and Biking place,5.0,,"Singapore is one of the few Asian countries I've been to that keeps runners and bikes in mind. The ECP has created a place for people to enjoy the long of the beach including places to stop for drinks and snacks, parks."
,,Nice place for walking or jogging,3.0,,"Nice seaside walk. Well kept, clean and paved paths. Good for bicycle riding, jogging and sports walk. Nice place for family picnic. Not a nature walk."
,,well this is the beach,5.0,,go to east coast park and the first thing to do get to the beach. the waves come towards you at a low speed but u will love it as the climate is just right for this
,,"Great place to exercise, socialize, relax and enjoy",5.0,,"The East Coast Park in Singapore is an ideal place for everyone. Whether it is for serious fitness folks or for leisurely walks or family fun, this is one place that negates any excuse one might have not to step out. The pathways are very well laid out for cycling and skating and there is a separate path for pedestrians or joggers. There are short stretches of calm beaches as well as a number of barbeque pits spread along the 20 odd kilometers of this long stretch. There are a few other places for hobbyists like radio controlled motor racing track, sailing, para sailing, restaurants, etc. Just avoid evenings on holidays and weekends if you dislike large crowds."
,,Watch out for special events,3.0,,"The last few times I've been cycling here the park has been affected by various special events and significant sections were closed completely to the public for extended periods of time. This can be quite a pain when you're trying to use this route to ride to Changi and back. When it's open it's great, but the frequency with which these events are held can be quite frustrating."
,,Greta for early morning or late afternoon walks/rides,5.0,,"Great place to bring the family for a play in the sand, in the park or to ride scooters, bikes, jog etc. Just beware it gets unbearably hot and uncomfortable in the middle of the day so best to plan for an early morning or late afternoon visit. Especially nice to visit on a breeze evening."
,,Great place to relax,4.0,,"East coast park and beaches stretch about 10 over km. It is a place for Marathon runners to train stamina. along the park, there are many restaurants in pubs that suits your budget. So not too worry hunger ping creeps. Morning and evening is an excellent time to exercise and stroll. The place is suitable for everyone."
,,50km cruise,4.0,,"Looking for a bit of exploring, exercise and adventure so hired a single speed from the bike hut in town and made my way (easily) to the East Coast Park (ECP). Rode up to Changi Airport on the beautifully, landscaped wide cycle track. Then mixed it up , heading inland to Bedok Reservoir which was more complicated to navigate but satisfied my need for adventure.
Took water (very hot) but you can buy food and drink at numerous places enroute.
Loved it!"
,,A lovely beach,4.0,,"Specifically visited East Coast Park to take part in ""Parkrun"" - a 5km run at 7.30am on Saturday morning but then returned to enjoy the walks and the beach - plenty of cafes. Literally hundreds of ships anchored just off-shore."
,,Love it,4.0,,Always a great place for a long walks...followed by coffee by the beach and enjoy the sunset and have seafood dinner by the sea..brilliant!
,,Nice beach and food,4.0,,The local delights were way too delicious and lots of varieties to choose from. It's always good to cycle around first and eat then cycle again.
,,A healthy run beckons ........ as does sinful food,5.0,,"This unique park that runs along the sea coast is place of paradoxes. You could do your health thing - long walks, jogging or cycling along the curated pathways designed for the purpose. Or you could succumb to the call of the crab ....... roasted and chillied ones being served up at the many outlets that line the East Coast park. You could party at one of the many bars on this stretch ...... or have a quiet camp out on the sea front. Simply loved the place ......"
,,Great way to spend a weekend afternoon,4.0,,"We love going to the East Coast Park on a Saturday ort Sunday afternoon. You can walk for miles (mostly under the shade of trees), have a swim (the water is clean and safe), or have something to drink and eat. There are also BBQs and tables along the park, but unfortunately, the BBQs are not gas and so you need to take your own wood or heat beads, and for some strange reason, the tables are out in the open instead of being undercover."
,,SEA FOOD,4.0,,This is an area used for exercise like cycling jogging and walking.Lots of restaurants also.The seafood is good here.Ideal for n evening outing.
,,Nice park to walk around but not much to do,3.0,,"Very average beach and although the parts of the park were nice, there was not a lot to do. Would recommend only if all other options are exhausted and you really needed to kill an hour or so."
,,ECP is for cycling,4.0,,"ECP is along the sea cost and you will lot of people who come for jogging, cycling, food, leisure. I love cycling across ECP, very relaxing."
,,Must must visit,5.0,,"We live across ECP. It is very relaxing, beach side and full of activities. Highly recommended for all travelers to Singapore."
,,lots of activities for singapore mainland beach,4.0,,"although the beach is not fantastic, the view to the sea is like oil tanker identification contest, the beach itself has lots of activities such as bicycle, 4 to 1, 2 to 1 type, and then there is skating and canoeing, basic sailing. No need to bring food, there are lots of stall nearby for that, unless you want to picnic. Most of our young BBQ at that place during school holiday, so avoid june and december.
Safe for night jogging and passing time, can always end up at the few rows of seafood for dinner there after."
,,"Fun in the Sun, Sand, Sea and Shade",5.0,,"Pristine beaches, landscaped gardens, segregated walkways, cycling paths, barbeque pits and fast-food joints… be here with your friends, your family or just by yourself to unwind. There are a couple of stores where you can rent bicycles and roller-blades of various sizes and quality to explore the park – including 2-seater tandem bicycles and 4-wheeled rickshaws for the family. There were several families with picnic mats and baskets enjoying the pleasant weather and scenery. I will surely come here again on my next visit."
,,The only place where you can play Holi...(festival of colours in India),5.0,,"As all know, Singapore is a FINE city!!

Initially I used to mistake it for regimentation of sorts.
After numerous of visits over the last 16 years I have realized that rules are rule and they are well considered and also for a purpose.

My grandchildren and I waited impatiently for the weekend.
We carried our pitchkaris (water sprinklers, colours, small buckets and change of clothes) and trooped to ECP.

We had great fun and unlimited water supply from the sea.!!

While we were playing HOLI, many others were having BBQs, parties, and other outdoor activities.

Either day or night ECP is a super destination..."
,,Nice place for Cycling beginners & Families,4.0,,"East Coast Park is so big that there's 5 areas as i remember.

It is good for cycling beginners and young kids with families activities.
Because the cycling path is wide enough and straight forward across the areas, which is quite safe for learning and sharpening cycling skills.

*The bicycle rental centre is in Area C (the middle of the park).
**If you need any supplies, like excercising shorts or water, there's cafe and sports supply shop in area B."
,,Rent a bike and go cycling,5.0,,My son loves cycling and this is exactly what we did. There are a few bike rental shops to choose from and it was a lovely experience to ride along the coast. There is a special cycling path which is most importantly safe.
,,Perfect for running,5.0,,"We drove to East Coast Park, which is easy to find with plenty of parking.

The purpose of our visit was to go for a run.

This a great route marked out for either a 5km run or a 10km run with the markers showing every 0 . 5km.

There is 7/11's or shops for refreshments."
,,East Coast Park,5.0,,We walked from our hotel Grand Mecure Singapore Roxy. Lovely park where the locals go to relax and exercise. You can hire bikes and ride into the city and there are restaurants also
,,Good place to walk,4.0,,"The East Coast Park is a good place to see all the locals out walking, jogging, cycling, having bar-b-ques, camping overnight in tents. You can rent bicycles there, including bicycles for two. The beach itself is clean, but not very broad. Not a place for swimming. There is a jogging path and a separate bicycle path. The park is well maintained, kept clean. Parking is available. There are restaurants scattered along the length of the park too. a nice place. Go in the mornings or evenings as it can be quite hot at other times."
,,nice day out,5.0,,"It is beautiful coast trail to get away city. Great place to cycling and enjoy sea breeze. Lots eateries and amenities around, pretty handy."
,,A different place to camp,5.0,,"I was staying very near to this place & my cousin instead to go there in morning. It was excellent place, saw people staying in camps overnight, strolling, cycling, jogging, small party & lot of other things. A must visit place in Singapore."
,,Great for locals,4.0,,"If you're a tourist looking for pristine beaches with crystal blue water, the East Coast Park is not the place for you. The beaches in Singapore are man made, but Singapore does do artificial very well. The East Coast Park is very popular with locals. The park stretches for kilometers along the beach, and you'll find people of all ages, strolling, running, blading, cycling on the paths, and swimming, canoeing, windsurfing, sailing in the sea. This is also a food paradise, with a huge food court, many seafood restaurants, cool cafes and hip watering holes. Whether you're there for a morning jog, or an afternoon swim, or an evening dinner or an overnight BBQ at one of the public pits or stay in a chalet, the East Coast Park has something for everyone."
,,The best beach park in the city,4.0,,"This park is one of the key attractions for all Singaporeans. You want to skate, bike, swim, camp, dine or just take a stroll"
,,Sprawling,4.0,,I was staying close by so had an opportunity to go there for a early morning stroll...very well maintained!
,,Great,5.0,,This was such a nice break from the rest of the city. There are tons of ex-pats here so there are great people to meet everywhere you go. There are restaurants on the beach as well that you can visit
,,relaxing,5.0,,"It is a very long stretch of beach which allows people to enjoy it in different ways - swimming, camping, cycling, kite flying, jogging, walking one's dog, sailing .... There are eateries all along the stretch offering budget conscious but delicious hawker fare, to expensive cafes, restaurants with different cuisines - Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian .... A wonderful place to spend the day out with the family!"
,,Ok for Sg,3.0,,"Looks, Sg is a fantastic small city state with very little space. If you are here a long time, them maybe visit. If a tourist, the rest of SE Asia has far more beach stuff to offer."
,,Awesome Place. Do not miss it.,5.0,,"We visited this place in March 2015. Its a very beautiful place. It is a very happening place after 5pm. It is basically a beach with lods of fun things to do.One such thing we tried was a couple cycle. My wife and I tried it and it was great fun. There even family rickshaws to roam around that place because the place is very big and beautiful. Must visit.

Note For Indian Travellers: Mostly tour operators in India do not include this place in their singapore package. So find out an evening free from your schedule and take cab yourself to visit this place. Its a no miss especially for Honemooners. :)"
,,Good way to spend the day,4.0,,"The east coast park is really massive. We asked the taxi driver to drop us off at the place where bicycles were available for hire.... then we hired bikes to cycle around. The bicycle charges vary based on the choice of bike and rentals are by the hour. There is a cycling and walking track and lots of places to stop by and relax . Families come here frequently to relax, cycle, walk around or have a BBQ. . The park is lined by the sea and is good for a dip on a hot day."
,,Great place for relaxing,5.0,,"I live just few minutes from the park, but i don`t really have much time to visit. been there few times, normally laying down for sunbathing, or walking around in the night. Really great place, clean and a lot of people during the weekend, better to visit during the working days.
Great place for chilling, walking, playing sports."
,,Cooling with breeze,5.0,,The wind is just nice and you get to hear the waves. Went during weekday so is not crowded at all. good place to cycle and have picnics
,,Great place for a run or a bicycle ride,4.0,,"This is definitely one of the best places for cycling, roller-skating with a family of young children in Singapore: long stretches of road reserved for cyclists along the coast, minimum slope and it is easy to park around, and find a place for a quick breakfast or lunch along the way. Definitely more enjoyable on week-days as week-ends are of course crowded, so we tend to bring our two children on week days during school holidays."
,,Good for walk and cycling,4.0,,"It's a good place for walking and cycling. It;s a good family activities and also with friends. Besides walking and cycling, you can also enjoy the breeze by the bay. Can also bring kids for sand playing and frisbee."
,,Quiet,4.0,,"Staying at a hotel in the vicinity, I took a long walk through this park and thought it very clean, well maintained and peaceful. As a solo female traveller, I must say that I felt very safe here. There were many joggers, cyclists and other walkers. It was a showery day but I found this a lovely way to spend a quiet few hours after two long flights. It was also well sign posted."
,,Average beach but nice for walking or cycling,3.0,,"The beach was not clean, but if you like walking, having a picnic or cycling, you can easily hire a bike and cycle around. There are bars and restaurants along the way where you can stop by and have a drink or two!"
,,Lovely walks and activities by the sea,4.0,,"A great place to spend some family time - walking, picnics, cycling etc. There are many paths and shady areas, shops to buy refreshments, places to rent bikes or just chill and watch the world go by."
,,"Goes on for miles, stroller-friendly",5.0,,"This path is well-maintained, and has some shade, making it lovely for walking with a stroller. Some shops and restaurants are positioned along the way."
,,Peaceful edge of the city.,4.0,,"This is a large coastal area on the edge of the city, with frequent restaurant areas. There are beaches, trees, flowers, joggers, cyclists and families enjoying barbecues. Well worth a visit to get away from the city, but so close too."
,,Nice each and amazing sea food,5.0,,This has a nice beach and some amazing Sea food restaurants. We spend an evening there and cannot get over the amazing Sea food that we had in a restaurant long beach.
,,"If u need the sun, sea and sand, head to Sentosa",3.0,,My review: Inconvenient (Public Transport); Nothing to see; Dirty; Boring... I would strongly recommend Sentosa where its more accessible and there are other places of interest to visit and more things to do.
,,Great weekend spot,4.0,,"If you're looking for a good place to hang out on a lazy weekend, ECP is probably the best place. If you get to ECP before the rush begins (usually before 10:30am), you could grab a BBQ pit and a sheltered cabana. If you don't have your own car, I would recommend taking a taxi to the ECP food court. That's where all of the good food and beer, that's also the best place to get a taxi when you're ready to head home."
,,Excellent Sunday at East Coast Park,4.0,,"We hired family bikes and enjoyed the park, plenty of places to stop, chill out, get refreshments, enjoy the view of the boats, lots of things for families to do"
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Nice place. It is serene and you can forget about everything for few moments. rent a bike and ride... walk, run or just sit...."
,,Cycle away...,4.0,,"This is a local favourite for a day in the sun - cycling or taking a great stroll. It is a flat surface walk/ride, which carries on for around 30km. You can rent bi-cycles at the park for relatively cheap rates - around 5-10 dollars an hr.

There are many convenience stores, fast food joints and restaurants across East Coast park. The park is accessible by bus or taxi, the closet MRT would be Katong MRT or Changi Airport.

Recommended time: 8-9am in the morning or 6pm after for dinner and drinks."
,,"Average beach, but go for cycling or outdoor BBQ",3.0,,"So this wouldn't be a place you'd go to for suntanning - the beach is dirty. However, the overall park itself is well laid-out with cycling and walking tracks, and there are bicycle, scooter, and skate rentals dotted around the area for you to rent. You can cycle from ECP all the way to the Gardens by the Bay - it's a very comfortable 30 mins' bike ride one way, but you'll have to bike up a bridge and that's a thigh killer (albeit good for burning calories). The bikes are in good condition and the rentals are reasonable if you'd like a different way of seeing Singapore."
,,Bad Views,3.0,,It would be a lovely place if we would not have to stare tons of tankers on the sea. This view takes all the beauty of the beach away and doesn't give you that relaxing feeling of the beach.
,,OK walk by the sea,3.0,,"It's ok for a walk every once in a while, but this is Singapore, so there are no beaches. Quite a few of the seaside restaurants and beach clubs are abandoned or undergoing renovation, so there isn't much to do besides walking or biking around the park."
,,Clean & Beautiful,4.0,,A perfect place for family bonding activities. The Singapore’s first cable ski park is located in ECP.
,,"Cycling, barbeques and beautiful sandcastles sculptures",4.0,,You can rent bicycles and tandem bikes to just go for a ride around the park. There are alos barbeque pits you can book to have your own gatherings. There is a part of the beach where people make sculptures out of sand for leisure. I was impressed by the intricate pyramids of gaza complete with the sphinx!
,,Fun for Children,5.0,,"A great place to relax and have a picnic, ride bikes and even paddle. East Coast Park also has many places to dine, especially if you like chilli crab or pepper crab. This is a place where every member of the family can enjoy."
,,20 kilometres of non-stop coastal leisure activities,5.0,,"East Coast Park is heaven for all types of leisure activities. One can walk or cycle non-stop in serene surroundings without a break. There are several public amenities, small ponds, restaurants and bicycle rental shops spread throughout the Park.

Jumbo Sea Food and tens of eateries dot the coast.

There is also a fishing place for those interested to enjoy fishing.

One can also stay in the Park either in the open in a tent or there is hotel accommodation available on-site which has BBQ facilities."
,,Awesome Biking,5.0,,"We rented bikes and rode all the way through the park connector to the merlion. The path is shady, well marked and well cared for. There are picnic areas and a couple sets of little shops along the route with food and snacks. There is a fantastic view of the city and it gives visitors the chance to get some exercise and cover a lot of ground at once."
,,Good place for outdoor activities,4.0,,"The park is along the beach and is quite expansive. After jogging, running or biking, you can stop at the park's hawker's center and indulge in sumptuous Singaporean food."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Very pretty. Great for walking, biking and then dining. You can rent a bike here. You can either eat at fancy places like Jumbo by the ocean, or walk up a little bit to eat at an outdoor food court. The Bedok Jetty near the food court is awesome. Highly recommend it. Avoid Sunday though cause it's more crowded."
,,Excellent Escape from the city,5.0,,"East Coast Park is a long emerald ribbon along the shore. Visiting on a Sunday, I saw family gatherings, young people riding bikes and skating.

They have BBQ pits and many covered shelters. The beach is not wide, but it is sandy. Hundreds of ships are visible in the distance.

The hawker center there is among the nicest outdoor hawker stands in SG. It is more spread out than most and there is a lot of covered seating."
,,A great cycling favourite of ours,5.0,,"Over 25km from Changi to Gardens by the Bay cycle friendly, do as much or as little as you like. Bike rentals available throughout Singapore"
,,Not my cup of Tea,3.0,,"Sadly Singapore only got few beaches and nothing that really captured my eyes, partially because the water is not clean and you can't really see much of beach or waves. But great for bbq and chalets around the coast area. Many local food stores and cycle for renting around the park makes East Coast a good choice if you wanna workout or spend a quite evening."
,,Good spot to hang out,5.0,,"Favourite hangout of locals - be it with friends or family. Scenery is good, people usually come here to play frisbee, swim, picnic etc. Remember to bring your own mats when you come here, unless you want to sit/put your things in the sand!"
,,Overorganized...,3.0,,Park creates a nice oasis in between the busy Marine Parade area and seaside. I understand that it is not easy to maintain such large public area which is very popular place for light sport. But I would rather appreciate larger number of drinking fountains instead of barbecue facilities.
,,So many things to do,5.0,,"East Coast park is a great gem in Singapore. The coast line stretches for more than 15km. There is such a big variety of eateries and restaurants. From the local hawker centers to trendy bars and breweries.

A great place to take your dog (on a leash of course) or go for a walk or jog and stop over at one of the many places for a beer or food. Many places to rent bicycles. There is even a small skate park.

Highly recommend this as a must visit for tourists and locals."
,,Good spot for Single/couple/Family,5.0,,"I stay 5 mins away from the east coast park and as a result I go there every weekend for a Jog/Walk/Cycle.

Its a great spot Singles (Who is looking for some peace or watch the world pass by), couple & Family.

My personal best spot near East Lagoon Food Coast, Big Splash & Parkland green as it give lot of eating options. For couple I would recommend Sunset Bar.

Walk down bedok Jetty to view locals fishing.

Bring: Sunglass/Sunblock/Caps/Beach Mat"
,,World Class Recreation Park,5.0,,"East Coast Park is a world class recreation park for all. It's lush greenery is simply out of this world. It stretches along a couple of kilometers along the coastal waters of Singapore.

It's a fantastic place for family, friends and individuals to gather for picnic, BBQ, cycling, skateboarding, jogging, fishing or simply to laze around.

You do not need to bring your bicycles if you don't have a car, you can rent one from the many bicycle stations.

There are toilets and shower facilities which are clean. They are stationed along the entire stretch. Ample parking space too.

If you are hungry, the is a wonderful hawker centre that caters wonderful local food at an outstanding price.

You have to be here to experience the wonderful facilities and lifestyle.

Hope you enjoy East Coast Park."
,,A relaxed pace by the sea and down memory lane in Singapore,4.0,,"Do you have an extra day in Singapore and would like to make things a little slower? A good option is to visit the East Coast area where you could make yourself closer to the sea. Its primary recreation area, the East Coast Park, is the best strolling ground in the country. Walk, jog, and bike in its more than five kilometers of walkways and bikelanes along white sand beaches. Picnics in Singapore are best done here. Swimming is not so much encouraged, but you can wet your feet in the gentle waves of the Singapore Strait. Across the sea, not far in the distance, are the infinite tankers and cargo vessels that still remind you of the country's position as Asia's trading hub.

Restaurants front the sea with their offering of seafood and other specialties. This is Singapore's seafood district. Try Jumbo's chilli crab and cereal prawn. If you want hawker fare, the East Coast will not disappoint. The Katong-Joo Chiat area, walking distance inland from East Coast Park, is a renovated copy of its early 20th century self with its colonial architecture. Chili crab, laksa, kwehs, and many other Singaporean specialities found their beginnings here as this is also the home district of the country's Peranakan and Malay communities.

To reach the place, take the MRT to Paya Lebar. At Paya Lebar Square, take a bus to Parkway Parade or Katong-Joo Chiat. Buses that go to East Coast Road, Joo Chiat, and Marine Parade Road will take you here. To get to the East Coast Park, alight at Parkway Parade, walk to Marine Parade Central (there's a big hawker center here), then pass by Fair Price. There is a tunnel at the back of Fair Price leading to East Coast Park."
,,Great Escape,5.0,,"ECP is an urban park and so much of the attraction is the people. It is rich with mature trees and shrubs and has miles of well-conceived cycling, running, and walking paths. There are restaurants, cafes, & hawker stalls scattered along the coast. Entertainment is varied - water world, sailing boat & board rental, bicycle rental, etc, etc. If I were looking for a place to live, walking distance from the ECP could be a deciding factor."
,,An excellent park,5.0,,"This is a great park for a nice stroll, a bike ride, or even a camping trip for a couple of nights. Highly recommended. Make sure you bring some mosquito repellent with you to the park though."
,,Really nice park and outdoor space..,5.0,,"Great for the little ones to run, bike, scoot off some energy. It doesn't seem crowded, plenty of space to play on the beach and have a picnic too or there are bars and cafes you can grab a bite to eat or drink.. seems to be a breeze most of the time which is nice."
,,Excercise there is prefect,3.0,,Had a good walk from East Coast Park to Garden By the bay where my friends cycled. It was a nice experience as we do not need to worry about the number of people as the path is pretty wide and also the traffic as some places you still need to stop at traffic lights. Only thing is that they should have more water point for people to drink or refill their bottles.
,,East Coast Park walk,4.0,,A very leisurely walk anytime day and/or night enjoying the breeze. The park stretches for a long way and is very serene during the day.
,,Walk. Walk. Walk,5.0,,"This is my favorite walking place. It has everything for everybody. Right from the
assortment of great food to bars, it's a place that combines food, drinks and sea view.
I recommend to walk towards Changi side as it is quieter as compared to the fort road side."
,,Not bad,4.0,,Not the best beach in the region but its clean and many seafood stalls around which you should check out. Went to watch the sunrise there and it was nice.
,,Great place for a stroll,5.0,,"I love East Coast Park! The great view of the ocean and ships coming in and out, the myriad of people of diverse backgrounds eating, or skating, or bicycling, or roller blading... lots of choices of restaurants available... it's just a great place to spend time. Weekends are particularly busy."
,,A place to cycle and stroll,4.0,,This morning went to East Coast Parkway near the food Centre with my son friends and the parents. Nice place just to stroll and cycle. Refreshing on the first day of the 2016.
,,Perfect place for everyone!,5.0,,"If you need to unwind this would be a good place - sea view for sunrise/ sunset to clear your mind, listening to sound of nature
if you want to take nice picture this would be a perfect place too!
You can enjoy local food @ East Coast Lagoon with variety of choices. A place that you should not miss if you think Singapore is a city without nature.. u will then realize you are wrong :)"
,,Go eat some crab,4.0,,"Went out to East Coast Park for the sole purpose of eating Crab. I wasn't disappointed.

I had a black pepper crab and a jug of Tiger beer sitting at night staring out to the ocean looking at the ships waiting to berth.

Life doesn't get much better."
,,Singapore offers 300km of park connectors. This is one of the best....if you like walking or cycling,4.0,,"Unfortunately no public bus or train. That's also why it's less busy. Many ways to get there.
Suggest take a MRT to Bedok station,take a taxi...maybe SGD10-15. Or go to bus terminus and ask the station master. Take a bus and walk. If you walk right, you head towards Gardens by the Bay. If you walk left you head towards Changi Point. Rent a bicycle if you can't walk. You can return it somewhere else. Just bring some cash to deposit. Food available along the way. Toilets and drinking water from tap available as well. But you can bring a bottle to refill. Bring a hat and sunblock. Very safe, many people walk even at night."
,,Don't swim in the sea,3.0,,"By Singapore standards this is a good beach, but really not fantastic. Don't get in the water it's pretty filthy and my son came out from under water holding a rusty old saw blade asking me what it was. Also avoit this on a Sunday like the plague as the whole of Singapore descends here and it's packed.

During weekdays hire bikes or roller blade and eat at the various cheap options - it's lovely. The breeze very welcome in hot Singapore too"
,,Nice and light breezy,4.0,,"East coast always my favourite. The vibes, the people, restaurant, pub, always been fantastic place to let your hair down. Is best place to get away from the CBD area, come to East Coast now."
,,Go Here for the Food,5.0,,East Coast Park is dotted with a number of excellent mid-priced food stalls and restaurants. Singapore Chilli Crab is an absolute must
,,Great place,4.0,,Great place for me since my childhood day. Now I come here my run with my mate. Food with my friend and family. A great place for BBQ too.
,,You wanna BBQ ! Go there for a Picnic,4.0,,"Good place to spend a day with family or friends or even alone ..its a great attraction for those who want to Barbecue , you can book pits or even plan for overnight camping. In Nutshell consider you going to be along side of vast water stretch…You may try cycling (rent it) or just relax with gastronomic pleasure…If you are a tourist and have limited days then you mey keep this in the last of the list as this is not anything unique to Singapore , there are so many other things quite great in Singapore worth exploring."
,,Lovely sandy beach,5.0,,"Wandered down here while my wife was at a hairdressers. Enjoyed a paddle in the sea, and a walk along the beach to a pier where some young guys were trying to catch crabs that were crawling up the concrete out of the sea. Lots of barbeques happening too. I wonder if a crab ended up on one?"
,,Park run,5.0,,"If you think you have acclimatised, test yourself on a 5 km Park Run 7:30 am every Sat, get your free barcode on-line. This run is very well organised and friendly and you can have a dip afterwards. You will need to call a taxi home -about $10 back to town"
,,A good place to relax and cycling,5.0,,"East coast park itself is a large area, well maintain and the pedestrian walk way are well-designed over the park.
It is a good place for cycling / jogging / BBQ / roller blade etc.
You can also play beach volleyball here.
Overall a good place to hangout."
,,East Coast Bedok Jetty,4.0,,"This jetty is extend about 300 meter out into the sea. Built in year 1974. It was use by the Singapore navy in the early years but now are open to public and it is free. You can come at anytime of the year. Day and night you will see a lots of people fishing and cycling around. The sea at the end part of the jetty is about 30 feet deep. From here you can see Indonesia batam island on the south eastern side when the weather is clear. Look toward the west, you can see the Singapore city sky line like the Marina bay sand hotel and the Singapore flyer. When the wind is blowing from the north eastern side(November to March), you can see all the aeroplanes from around the world that coming in to land at Changi airport one by one flying passed this jetty. Lots of activity at the jetty also. Day time you can see many angler jigging small bait fish by fly hook(hook tie with green n white thread). Night time if you are lucky you may see big fishes landed by angler. You also can see angler catching squid using a kerosene lamp hang below the jetty with a scoop net. There is a toilet just outside this jetty entrance. East coast lagoon food centre is about 500 meter walk away. Lost of good food here and it is crowded during weekend. I highly recommended you to visit this place if you are in Singapore and love out door life. You just need to tell the taxi driver drop you at car park F1 east coast beach and walk toward the sea side. Public buses only available on weekend from Bedok bus n train interchange."
,,Relaxing stroll along the seaside,5.0,,"The East Coast Park runs along the Singapore sea side between Changi airport and almost the Marina Bay. It is very nice for walking under palm tres, there are a few sandy beaches, and lots of small restaurants and bars. You can also rent a bike, apply at the local authority for using the barbecue pitch and on weekend nights it is a popular spot for camping."
,,Good attraction still at East Coast Park,4.0,,"Great to see families and everyone enjoying themselves after the haze. Still great for jogging, outdoor, BBQ, everything outdoors. One of the much needed parks in Singapore. Many amenities and its safe even later in the evenings."
,,Often visit,4.0,,"Visit often with friends family. Very nice and clean beach, nice separate walking and cycling track.

Wide variety of activities and food available at different car park points. Evening sunset is beautiful. Night there are some quiet spots for couple visits.

Beach sand is alot artificial, so its not very fine and abit rough compared to other beaches"
,,Great place to relax,5.0,,"If you could spare some time in Singapore, you should drop by the East Coast Park and watch Singaporean play, exercise, BBQ, or just relaxing by the beach. Once the Round Island Route is ready in a couple of years time, East Coast Park will be part of a larger network of cycling route; you can cycle around the entire island."
,,Breadth of Fresh Air,5.0,,"Go over the weekend , and break-free from the hustle bustle of the city . With the sea breeze and ocean view till the end of the horizon , cycle around the park and get a glimpse of Singapore ! Have a swim , and come prepared for a barbecue , else treat yourself with varied choice of delicacies at the food-court. stroll through the park , absorbing the peace and tranquility best experienced during a sunset / sunrise. A perfect picnic and activity filled day outing."
,,Peaceful and relaxing,4.0,,"My friend and I visited East Coast Park for a relaxing afternoon. The park is a narrow but long strip of tranquility in the buzz of Singapore. It includes lots of beaches with warm almost flat sea water and paths for cycling and walking between the hundreds of tall trees that provide welcome shade.

Very safe and clean, the East Coast Park is a lovely place to while away an afternoon. Sit on the beach, cycle or run or walk the paths, or buy some refreshments at the food court area."
,,"Great place for a nice evening stroll, drinks, seafood",5.0,,"The horizon will be filled with ships, but the waters look pristine, the wind is amazing, and head up to one of their many bars and seafood restaurants for some breezy drinks/food."
,,relaxing,4.0,,"nice place to for a picnic, chill and bbq. very crowded on weekends though. there's a food center somewhere near bedok jetty. lots of varieties of food,"
,,Hang out,4.0,,A good place to walk or run. Also for all the cycling enthusiasts who can bring their own cycles or rent it. Its also good for doing barbecue and camping.
,,Nice But Extremely Crowded on Weekends,4.0,,"I come here regularly for walks. It is very pleasant when its not crowded - usually early mornings or weekdays and it is well shaded with trees. It is like a busy shopping mall on weekends and you have to walk carefully to avoid knocking into someone or someone's bicycle/tricycle. This is a long narrow park with parallel walking and cycling paths. You can rent bicycles and there is also a special vehicle put together using 2 bicycles with seats for the whole family (seats up to 4 or 5 persons) - would have made for a nice family outing. You can do long long walks/runs as it stretches all the way from east coast to the marina barrage area. There are food places around (too many expensive restaurants though, should have more hawker type food along the park) but they are increasing paid car-parking spots instead of free parking (bad)."
,,"Food market for lunch, followed by a ride into the city",4.0,,"We had a great day out here.

Took a cab from the city out and had some lunch at the hawker market there - which as with most of them was incredibly good value.

Then hired bikes from the rental store close by, about $8 an hour per bike. We had them the for around 3 hours and cycled back into the city via the Gardens by the Bay and across the Marina Barrage.

A good, fun afternoon out."
,,Miles and miles of mental peace,4.0,,"As a runner, I am always looking for places to get my distance on in Singapore - and ECP is definitely that place. Long, flat, and distance-marked, East Coast Park is a runners' paradise.

From their free-to-the-public Parkruns on Saturday mornings to their almost-deserted shores on weekday afternoons, ECP is a fantastic place to seek solace, hang out with the family, or bring out of town guests to show off a little bit of Singapore's natural beauty.

I would definitely head over here more often if it was easier to access via public transit, but it's a worthy journey nonetheless."
,,Nice place with plenty to do,4.0,,You can hire a bike or bring your own and have loads of space to enjoy a day out. Lots of places to eat or grab a drink. If it's too hot jump in the water for a swim.
,,Unwind and relax - enjoy the sea breeze,4.0,,We visit weekly when we have our weekly family cycling time. One of the nicer places to cycle along in Singapore enjoying the sea breeze. We stop at the jetty area closer to the sailing club to take a break and watch the aeroplanes preparing for their landing at Changi Airport. You can rent different types of bikes and also rollerblades. Food wise - check out the East Coast Hawker centre located within the park or one of the many eateries at The Parkland also at the park itself. The weekend crowd on mornings are managable. But it is extremely crowded on public holidays. Do try to avoid.
,,Fun and fresh air in the city,5.0,,Hadn't been here for ages and had a blast - rented a tandem for 2 hrs and we had a great time - managed to reach the Barrage which meant some welcome cooling breeze and spectacular views of the Singapore Flyer and MBS - all for only $20. A bargain afternoon out!
,,"Nice path for a run or bike ride, if you don't mind the humidity.",4.0,,"All along the East Coast is a nice pedestrian/bike path that takes you along the beach. It is a great place to people watch and get some exercise. The path stretches the length of the East Coast between Changi Airport and downtown Singapore. You can actually go a long way since this path connects the the one along the Singapore river. East Coast park is quiet and peaceful, if you continue into or from Singapore you will pass Marina Sands, the Gardens by the Bay, etc. Once you get past the hotel it can get a little hectic as you will be going through the financial district and along the river through the Quays."
,,Bar-b-q or camping - everything is fine here,4.0,,"I was there more than once during my stay at Singapore and this place is fine when you are planning to camp (book a tent also) or just plan to chil out on the shore with group of friends or family. Cycles can be rented or good place for jogging. Book bar-b-q pit if you plan to grill something. Take your own booze or you need buy there, which will be expensive at restaurants. People do fly kites there or go for brief bath (not sure if lifeguards are watching ).
Overall, perfect place for weekends."
,,My haven in Singapore <3,5.0,,"I love going to East Coast park esp. early in the morning when it feels like it's just me and mother nature, bonding. The beautiful sunrise there soothes my weary soul and rejuvenates my spirit. It's my favorite place to go to when I need to clear my head and think - I just take a walk along the shore and that helps me a lot! I don't swim on the water though, it doesn't look clear. But I love this place just way it is."
,,Great to Cycle,4.0,,"I go there every couple of weeks . Go midweek avoid school holidays and its a quiet , pleasant ride. Lots of cycle rentals .
I usually start at area B , Big Splash , free car parking now mid week upto 5pm . Bike rental $6-8 with free 2nd hour . That easily gives time to cycle from ""B"" to the the final section ""H"" and back. You can continue cycling into Changi if you want.
Its also great now that if you cycle the other way past ""A"" , its now open all the way to Gardens by the Bay. Again you can have a pleasant 2 hours cycling round Marina Barrage and the Gardens.
I sometimes make a 1/2 day of it by taking visitors to see Gardens by the Bay , can have lunch there etc . Remember to take bike locks though.
Another option is to go to area ""E"" , East Coast Lagoon where there is a big food centre..Chilli Crab , Satay etc plus a couple of bike rental shops. Means you can cycle around for however long you want and then have a great lunch / dinner and not be paying for the bikes."
,,solitude weekday mornings,4.0,,Check tide Best time high tide or after some rain Mornings are the best ... Preference upper east coast where the road nearly ends ....bring your own picnic basket At low tide sometimes it gets rather full of sticks and things
,,Couple Bicycle Riding Rental,4.0,,I enjoyed our picnics together with my housmates. We enjoyed refreshing wind while eating our bring-from-home finger foods. We also experienced the couple biking! I enjoyed it much!
,,Lovely beach,4.0,,Loved the place. Walkways & cycling tracks by the beach...safe secure fun. There are cycle rentals & it was fun to cycle after such a long time. Many restaurants around...its a longish strech & fun place.
,,Good Park in Singapore,4.0,,"East Coast Park is one of the best in Singapore and free to public. You can cycle, eat , swim and even skate /cycle"
,,great stretch of beach right by the city,4.0,,great for a cycling session or maybe a jog? they have some nice coffee places/ restaurants to grab dinner later
,,Away from hustle & bustle :),4.0,,"A totally serene place away from the hustle and bustle of the city, this long stretch of land with green grass, nice walkways and kind-of-curve-shaped beaches where waters of the Singapore Strait ""gently"" land upon (no big waves here!) is really an IDEAL place to come and unwind while taking in great views of the strait. You could come for a leisurely walk or for camping (saw quite a few tents but I think you'll need to buy a permit or something) or for some great seafood like Singapore's famous 'chilli crab' at East Coast Seafood Centre where there's a cluster of restaurants (quite ""pricy"" food at some of them though) near the east end of the park.

I didn't see any shower facilities on the beaches here although there were a few people in the water, maybe they were guests at the bungalows nearby (there are those on the East Coast Parkway that runs parallel to the park); in any case, swimming may not be a good idea here with big container ships and such (bound for the Port of Singapore I'm sure) at like mere 200 meters or so away in the water from the park, so that kind of proximity to the ships in my opinion is a ""bit of a downside"" when it comes to swimming at the beaches here although I didn't see any garbage at all either on the beaches or in the water. There's one ""unique"" thing you could do at these beaches though, which is going up the rock mounds that are kind of pyramid shaped and just some short distance apart from one another right on the edge of the water. Also, there's something you'll notice here if you look out to the sky above the horizon either from the beach or from the promenade railing near the restaurants (like I did) and keep your eyes there for a little while, which is planes coming for landing every few minutes (like every 2 or 3 minutes) ""without fail"" no matter how long you watch :), that's how busy the Changi Airport is!

One way to get here by public transportation is taking the MRT to Promenade station (blue & yellow lines) and then taking a bus going east on East Coast Parkway, but what I would suggest if you have at least one other person with you is just taking a cab from anywhere in the city center to the park. My mom and I arrived by means of MRT, bus AND walking for like 10 to 15 minutes, but for the way back we took a cab back to the city center (the Bugis area) from East Coast Seafood Centre (mentioned above) and it cost about the same as MRT & bus for two people (like 10 SGD)!"
,,Lazy days slowly cycling around.,5.0,,"We love this park! Used to live 5km away and would come cycling through at least once a week. It goes pretty much all the way into town and has some nice little beaches, bike hire, cafes, kids play area and sandcastle zone.
For more info, sparks website has all the details on every park in singapore. Def worth a visit."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,East Coast Park is a great place to go with family or friends. It's got spacious walking areas and a gorgeous beach and view. There are also several restaurants located nearby. Would definitely recommend visiting if in Singapore and there is pleasant weather.
,,Go rent a bike and enjoy!,5.0,,"Took us about 45 minutes by bus to get there, but it is a great place to rent a bike and ride around. There is one big outlet that is easy to find online, but there are other bike rentals, one would have been much closer to the East Coast Lagoon Food centre that we were eating at, if only I had known before :) I can only imagine that it gets very crowded on the weekend."
,,Where the locals go at the weekend,4.0,,"Lovely long stretch of coastal park with a walking and cycling park along the beach/waterfront on the east coast. Plenty of nice food and beverage options too along the 8km stretch of coastal park.

Plenty of activities for families - try the Shell traffic games cycling route for kids where kids can cycle round paths designed to look like roads and park their bikes in little mini Carpark spaces and 'fill up' at a mini Shell station. Or visit the kampong fishing ponds where kids can catch a fish or prawns. Great fun.

Hire a bike and gently cycle along the flat and well-maintained paths by the sea - with gentle sea breezes all the way. The bikes for hire are reasonable price and quite well maintained - you can also get tandems or bikes that can be peddled by 4 with a canopy on top.

You can also walk along the paths under the huge tree canopies that provide some welcome shade (note not all stretches are shaded so bring sunblock!)

You can also rent shaded barbecue areas and cabanas - as with many coastal parks in Singapore - and at the weekend almost every BBQ pit is full of families and friends having a great time, which lends itself to a very happy and relaxed atmosphere.

The beach is small but ok for beach combing and dipping your toes in the water. You'll rarely see people swimming though - for that I'd recommend Sentosa.

Dogs are welcome on a leash."
,,Excellent place for weekend picnic,5.0,,"I and my hubby did picnic here a few times. Surrounding area is full of place to sit down under the shade. If you don't wanna bring your own food, you could buy one there. A lot of food & drinks stalls in certain area.

This place also provided BBQ Pits which you could book and paid in advance..great for party along the beach"
,,Life in Nature,5.0,,"East Coast Park is a green park. No motor vehicle there so definitely no noise, Highly secured, always safe. Feeling better near beach, Rental bicycle is available for cycling. a place of happiness."
,,A great day out,4.0,,Fun to be having a picnic or riding bicycles at the beach park with family.. Also exquisite choices of food from the hawker centre !
,,Singapore's Best!,5.0,,"As a local resident living minutes away, I have been a regular visitor and can't help falling in love with this place each time. Great for individuals and family alike, the beach, cycling tracks and nearby eateries are an attraction for all!"
,,place to walk/jog near parkway parade,4.0,,"This park is located on the coastline near the Parkway parade - a small underpass leads to this park.
Good for a nice morning/evening walk, you`ll find the locals jogging all around.
I had stayed in a hotel nearby and access to this park was pretty quick.
The shore is clean, but the sea is rough; swimming is not allowed."
,,Excellent Hawker Centre,5.0,,The park is made up of a long beach with good walking/running track. There is also a vibrant hawker centre which is great to visit at night. Huge range of local food on offer and great way to try a range of food.
,,It's a qualified 5 star but definitely a good place to go,5.0,,"I go to the park every weekend or so, either for a bike ride or to hit a restaurant or pub. It's a very long strip along the coast that runs from the CBD area all the way to the airport. There are several different areas with clusters of restaurants and stalls, places to rent paddle boards and various ocean gear, bike paths, bike rental places, bbq stations you can reserve and lots of camp sites. On the weekends a lot of foreign workers will camp out there and get their grooves on in the tents.
In another country that is more green, less developed, etc, you would not be very impressed with the park. However, considering the fact that you are in a relatively small city state with a huge premium on space, this is a slice of much needed quiet and peace(and green!)"
,,Interesting,4.0,,Good beach with lots of good eateries there. Dirty tho at a few portions but a must visit. A long and superb stretch of the beach and its awesome. good for cycling and a stroll.
,,East coast Park.. Singapore,3.0,,The East coast Park is a ideal location for fitness buffs as also for friends and family. It is on the coast and has a small beach. Many ships can be seen berthed along the coast and provides an awesome background.
,,Nice man made beach not far from the city,4.0,,"A man made 6 mile strip of beach which runs from close to the city centre all the way along the east coast to Changi Airport. It is clean, tidy and well served with amenities - bars, restaurants, cafes, play areas, bbq pits and lots of other interesting attractions. A good way to spend an afternoon especially if you have kids..."
,,Remember to buy some food,4.0,,"You can take a bus from downtown to the east coast. You will find the shophouses first. They locate in a quiet area. You can also easily find some super delicious food like pork bun on the way from the community to the coast. It's a cozy place that you can run away from tall buildings in CBD temporarily.

P.S. You can wash your feet in the toilet no problem. They provide also shower room that you are free to enjoy the sea:)"
,,Family outing,5.0,,"This is the most popular beach in Singapore, families spend weekends and holidays here BBQing, cycling, blading and dining."
,,Saturday morning jog,4.0,,spend a saturday morning joggin along the beach or just strolling in the sand...amazing feeling. Amongst the few places in SG that are open areas that public can enjoy
,,Serene Place,5.0,,"Its a huge park that has everything.

A great view of the sea, lots of greenery and trees, cafes, restaurants, shops and bike rentals.

One can rent a bike (single, couple or family) at a hourly rate and traverse through the park.

The park ends into the Gardens by the Bay area which merges in to the Marina Barrage and onwards to Marina Bay sands.

So you can cycle all the way from one end of the park to Marina Bay Sands.

The ride is a 20.6 km two way run and takes about 2 hours (with short breaks).

Its a great way to spend the morning.

The park is open late into the night and people jog, cycle and relax.

There are futsal courts, fishing areas as well to keep one occupied."
,,Exercise by the side of the beach,5.0,,"Take a stroll or by bicycle would be good choice in the afternoon, you also can bring your dog to here for a walk. When you need a location for barbecue party, this can be a nice place to hang out."
,,Great way to spend the day,4.0,,"Better than any of the commercial attractions in Singapore, spend a day out cycling or skating. The park is very clean and bike/skate rentals are easily accessible, at affordable prices."
,,Amazing,5.0,,I was exiting to visit this place. You could rent a bicycle what you want. there is a good road and many good places for food.
,,A quiet area,3.0,,Interesting - a lot of different areas and food types to explore. A good view of all the ships waiting to dock in the harbour. Worth a visit if you want something relaxing to do
,,Wonderful peaceful park,4.0,,"Singapore you can be proud of this one. Extremely clean and well cared for. Facilities are abound and it is very well supported which is great to see. Signage out lining what you need to know and best of all - no graffiti! Seating areas are pristine and there are plenty of BBQs. Wonderful walkway so you can walk for miles, or bike (hireage available). This walkway is separated and very clearly marked out. Plenty of campers in small tents at the weekend and a lot of family activity. Shore line cleaned up regularly."
,,East coast park,4.0,,On the eastern part of singapore they have made East coast park for the recreational activities for Singaporeans . You can cycle walk play enjoy the sea breeze . They have made water skiing on one end . And other water sports like hatching etc . It is relaxing full of life for all ages
,,nice and clean!!!,5.0,,Very clean beach . We often go t here with our son. He likes to make sand castles. They have free tutorials on sand castle making on weekends.
,,The most relaxing place,5.0,,"I love to be here! Whenever I visit Singapore, I'll always spend 1 day here.. Running, Cycling, Skateboarding, Having barbeque with your family or friends, or even sitting only and seeing the seaside view will relaxing your mind! Singapore's government has been really concerned about this place to be family's leisure park, they provided so many seats with many trees beside."
,,Singapore’s most exciting invitations,5.0,,"East Coast Park, locals and tourists flock to for the variety of sporting, entertainment and dining attractions. Along this 15-kiliometre of beach, you’ll find hordes of cyclists and roller bladder’s enjoying the sun and sea breeze, while cable skiing and water sports are on offer for those who prefer wetter pursuits. It’s a great place to just sit back and relax too, with no shortage of restaurants, bars and cafes along the beaches. Great for a picnic with family and friends. Whatever you choose to do, there’s no better way to end the day here than with hearty local fare at the East Coast Food Lagoon, where you can feast on local favourites like satay and barbecued chicken wings right on the beach. The attraction available at East Coast Park makes this one of Singapore’s most exciting invitations."
,,Our first day!,4.0,,We stayed in tbis area and it was lovely. The walk alng the Parkway is interesting and safe. A good way to ge tthe feel of the place.
,,Nice place to spend with family and friends,4.0,,"ECP offers a lot to all age group ... BBQ, picnic, running, skating, cycling etc.

Even as tourist you can choose to spend one evening here, there are lot of restaurants and food joints along the beach

Recommended for sea food joints and a stroll in the evening can give good impression of social life in Singapore"
,,Best place for cycling,5.0,,"Its a perfect place for a picnic, camping, barbeque, jogging, cycling, or just doing nothing. ECP stretches for many kilometers. Hence it is very easy for people to find a spot crowded or silent as per their need. It provides a great view of all the ships docked at night. One can rent a bicycle and go right up to Marina Bay Sands via Gardens by the Bay which is very exciting."
,,Lovely area,4.0,,"Great for walk...cycling...hiking...running...camping...BBQing ...You name it...it's all happening here. Still under a lot of construction in places for new eateries ...but still some around including Jumbo Seafood...Long Beach...Seafood centre,,,and of course the fast take away big names. Well worth a day out"
,,Bike ride,5.0,,I was fortunate to be able to loan a friends bike and rode through central all the way to east coast park. So glad I did very relaxing day and the beach was clean although I didn't have my swimmers so I didn't get the chance to swim.
,,"East Cost Park, good for day out by the sea",4.0,,"East Coast Park is good for day out by the sea. Lots of restaurants, cycle rides along the coast, cruise is also available. gets busy in the evening. Very relaxing atmosphere. No beds or parasols.."
,,A must do,5.0,,"Lovely reclaimed water frontage, a vey pleasant walk with a couple of great hawker markets for a great cheap meal."
,,Cycling Day,5.0,,Brought our kids here for a day of cycling at the beach. After so many years this place is still the best and very busy. Lots of campers setting up their tent here. This place is crowded with locals and maids to enjoy some gathering. Still one of the best place to visit in Singapore. Good place to cycle and enjoy the beach.
,,A good day out down the coast,4.0,,Good for a day out down the coast....bicycles for rent and plenty of eats and rest places.....try Crab in the Bag or Oosters for eats and drinks
,,Great park and beach area.,4.0,,"Our hotel was only a 10 minute walk from East Coat Park so we spent a lovely couple of hours just walking along the beach and park area. The park provides a lot of shade from the very hot temperatures with numerous café and restaurants. The park is huge and makes an ideal spot for cycling.
There are shelters dotted along the sea shore in case of a thunderstorm, there are BBQ pits and a crazy golf course. Whilst quiet during the week at weekends gets very busy with families."
,,A great area for fresh sea food and outdoor exercise.,4.0,,"Out of town en route to Changi. A place to go towards evening if you are visiting Singapore for a week or so. Walk, hire a bike, roller blades etc, and refresh yourself at one of the popular seafood restaurants."
,,East Coast getaway,4.0,,You have children to go out with you then this would be the place to go. They enjoy high speed biking. Hoards of activities can be seen in this park Friday through Sunday. They shaley here during weekends.
,,A fun park,4.0,,I like this park as there seems to be a lot going on. We usually hire bikes and cycle up and down along the sea. I usually go for a dip in the water at some point. It is very busy on the weekends but I like that. There are a good number of bars and restaurants to refresh yourself and the children always enjoy going.
,,Beautiful relaxing beach side,5.0,,"Hello friends, i live just near to ECP and its my favrt place to relax and spend my evenijgs. We carry some food and drinks with us and spend our evening near the beach...its vert relaxing at times when whether is in your favour. Very windy place...but yeah the only problem is you will see hell lot of ships standing by , which blocks your long strech ocean view. Still its very neat and clean place. Perfect place to spend your evening. There are lot of restraunt ( see food, indian restraunt petro bar in 920 east coast parade, atmosphere bar, jumbo, mcd etc)"
,,Relaxing beach,5.0,,"Great park for a picnic, stroll and even a cycle ride. Its a refreshing and a nice clean beach. Great for all ages."
,,Once in a while...Why not,4.0,,Took a bus ride to reach in the evening. 2 families. Had a wine and a bit of dine at the beach. Loved the time spent. A bit of cycling as well. I suggest get your stuff so you don't have to buy there.
,,Sports and relaxation.,4.0,,"Visiting East Coast Park regularly for sports or a bite at one of the many restaurants.

It is the green corridor all the way from the Central Business District to Changi Airport.
Cycling (rental bikes available)
Watersports (SUP/sailing/windsurfing)

For tourists that want to have a beach day out I would advise to go to Sentosa and not to East Coast Park."
,,Great for family outing,5.0,,"My family goes there when we are free, we love taking a stroll in east coast from the area near bayshore to parkway."
,,"Good for bikers and runners, and lovers of thin strips of greenry",3.0,,"One of the things about Tripadvisor is that it nags you to write reviews of things. So as I lived in Singapore for 5 years, I am prompted to write about so many places I know and visited in Singapore. But here's the thing: Singapore really has perhaps half a dozen major attractions that are worth a visit (the Botanic Gardens, recently elevated to World Heritage status, is the standout), and as many again smaller but fascinating and/or poignant ones (such as Reflections at Bukit Chandu). The rest is, well, a bit average, but Trip Advisor keeps bugging me to comment on them, so I dutifully do. The thing is though, the more reviews of average places that I write, the more I feel I am doing Singapore a disservice: truly it's a great place, but like anywhere so small and with only a couple of hundred years of documented history, there's a finite number of truly remarkable sights.

And East Coast Park is not one of them. It's a long, thin man-made strip of green space created between the sea and the 6-lane highway to the airport. At the front is a rather sad beach which looks out on the world's largest maritime parking lot: great for ship-spotters but not so attractive for those wishing to sip cocktails as the sun sets over the palm trees. Behind this are a couple of non-vehicular roads for use by lapping runners and cyclists, of whom there are very many - enjoy as the loud lycra clad American MAMIL trying to set a personal best lap time almost runs down the picnicking Chinese family with 4 children under 10, each intensely resenting the other for trying to use the space their own way. In the middle, at the wider part between the two roads, are a food court, various well-known seafood restaurants and chain fast-food joints, and other spaces such as a 5 a side football complex.

Personally, I'd only use this if I lived close to it. I've done a number of organised runs here, but it's nowhere near as interesting as MacRitchie, the Botanic Gardens or even the Singapore River as a place to clock up a few miles. Serious bikers too should come here only very early in the morning (many do just that from 4 am onwards) or prepare to dodge the wandering hordes and (heaven forfend) slow down to a safe, leisurely pace.

So, in short, more of interest to the anthropologist than the scenery-seeker."
,,Can be crowded,4.0,,"You will be amazed that so many people exercise in Singapore while you are there. Cycling, in line skating, jogging or strolling. BBQ pits are also located here (need booking). There are several restaurants there as well but do note parking is limited."
,,Budget-friendly but don't expect too much,3.0,,"The Singapore government did a very wonderful job coming up with a park like this but given the limitations, it does not really compete with the beaches in many island countries. The most difficult setback is the fact that the shipping lanes are in front of the swimming area so practically the horizon is a silhouette of big ships.

However, for a fun stay, the park has many amenities. Jogging lanes, barbecue pits, volleyball area, picnic area, kite-flying space, restaurants, toilets, bicycle and skating lanes. This is a budget-friendly attraction (you can just bring your own food) but don't expect too much from the beach itself.

Getting there by bus is also easy as there are bus stops a few steps off the park.

If you are tired of the buildings and roads, this park offers a commune with nature."
,,Chill Out and Enjoy the Breeze,5.0,,"I go to East Coast Park to walk, run, cycle or eat. There are numerous possibilities one can do there.

Take a bus from Bedok Bus Interchange or take any of the underpasses from along East Coast Road or Upper East Coast Road to get there. There are some free carparks along East Coast but that might become a thing of the past eventually.

There are a few bike rental shops but particularly one where you can return the bicycles to any of their outlets.

Tired of walking around? Have a bite at any of the bars, restaurants or even the hawker centre and try any of the local delights like char kway teow, satay, chicken rice, hokkien mee or otah.

Watch the sky turn dark as you sit along the shore and watch the ships turn into dim lights out at sea."
,,East Coast Park,3.0,,"The park itself is very nice with many BBQ spots and beaches, unfortunately the shipping lanes are directly off the beach. Would not recommend swimming here (you can see the oil in the water), but a nice place for biking and there are some very good satay stands at the hawker center."
,,Beach for chilling!,5.0,,"it's good place to chill out in SG, we walked on the beach side till sunset was gone. there also have some restaurants which is good, live music. love this place. simple classic right away from everything too crowded in town."
,,Calm and serene,5.0,,"Great place to chill out and just relax. Not so crowded .. a place to be for a serene atmosphere and surrounding. Please take time to unwind, in this place while in a fast-paced Singapore."
,,Most beautiful weather in Singapore,5.0,,I just loved this place. You can arrange parties for your friends here. No charges for the location. And the weather at this 'beach with park' is just fantastic.
,,Very disappointing,1.0,,"I love Singapore. I love that there is so much to do for a family with young children. I love the clean and easy public transport. I love that it is safe and clean. I love the food. I love that people who are from Singapore are very proud of their country. That is why I was so disappointed when I visited East Coast Park. We spent all of our time at the beaches by the hawker centre. The beaches were horrible, there was a huge amount of rubbish on the sand and in the water. Some had been washed up from the ships, but a lot had been left by people on land.
I hate people who litter. I hate the thought that a plastic bag or bottle that has been thoughtlessly discarded could kill a marine animal. I hate the fact that NO ONE else on the beach that day seemed to be bothered about the amount of rubbish on the beach.
So I chose a small section of beach (about 200m) and picked up all the rubbish. I filled 3 bags full (not counting the 6 large plastic drink bottles). People looked at me like I was crazy. One person (an American lady) thanked me.
People of Singapore, if you truly love your country, go down to East Coast Park and keep it clean. It might not be your rubbish, but it is your Park."
,,Improved with cleanliness and BurgerKing,5.0,,"The beach Area has improved.There are now better Bicycle renting shops.We as a group took a quad Bike for four people of course.The bike lane is good.There is a Jetty for great pictures too.This trip was healthy for us as we needed two teenagers to recover and become healthy.Kindly see my blog cardsoftheworld.blogspot.com for details on postcards and travel.
As we were in the daytime we could see many features.Mostly the bike lane was well maintained.We could get a good exercise.
At the end of the bicycle ride we saw a Burger King Fast Food place.So we enjoyed ourselves at the lunch time too.Then we spent a lot of time at the beach .
At some places we can see a lot of floating wood.However if we are careful we can enjoy the beach better.

The Taxi drivers know how to reach this place from Joo Chiat..However when you exit from this beach you need to walk over a bridge and then cross a highway while will lead you to a housing block and a huge housing colony where you can get lots of taxis."
,,Eastcoast park,5.0,,Eastcoast park . Is a huge place to walk. A huge place to swim too.beautiful view. Lots of restaurant there too.a huge place to drive your bicykel there too.
,,Great Park!,5.0,,"This is one if the better outdoor parks you'll find in Singapore, but can be a tad hard to get to using public transport (buses only, and not a lot if stops). Also makes it hard to take bicycles for the kids due to not being able to take bikes on a bus. It's the perfect place to ride if you can get there with your bike. All paths are bitumen, and the park is well maintained.

There is BBQ pits there, rubbish bins also, so take a picnic and make use of the grass and trees.

If if were more accessible from Central Singapore, I'm sure we would visit more often."
,,Relax place for picnic,4.0,,"Have been here counntless times for picnic. Nice place to vist either in the early morning or late afternoon after 4 pm. You can bring your inline skates, bicycles and skate scooters to enjoy yourself. Most of the parking is free at designated car park."
,,Good place for bike rides albeit a bit crowded at first,4.0,,"We took the hour long bus ride to get there. It was pretty worth the visit if you are looking for things to do. If you are a tourist not on a work visa you need to take cash for the deposit on each bike you rent. If you are here on a work visa be sure to bring that. Once on the bikes, we rode north toward the airport. It was pretty crazy and crowded with people at first but once you get a half a mile north it is easier with less pedestrians and bikes all clustered. It is cooler on the bikes with the ocean and you create your own breeze but still pretty hot. Plan to get there when bike shops open. And take lots of water in a back pack. There are bathrooms and a few water fountains but mostly in the beachy areas. We rode up to watch airplanes take off as my college age son is studying to be a pilot. There are plenty of trees most of the path where moat people venture. You can stop and enjoy the ship views from the beaches. If you are expecting a beautiful ocean view devoid of ships, this won't be it. We had a great Father's Day and rode 16 miles."
,,The Place for Exercise,4.0,,"If you are looking for a place to go get some exercise and take a walk away from the City, East Coast Park is the place."
,,Cycle riders delight,4.0,,"A famous beach side attraction in the city.it is also famous for its cycle rides.
One can see array of cycle renting shops here.
People used to hire it and use it in the whole midnight which is really unforgettable experience.
A bit of loneliness can be felt on weekdays ."
,,Terrific Day Out,5.0,,Great place for young and old. There's plently of bike hire places along the stretch of park so you can turn up and ride for as long as you like and any pace you like because it's nice and flat. We came here for picnics and there's also lots of resturants along the way.
,,Perfect place to relax and exercise,5.0,,"The ocean and the park is good for the families for picnic . Best time is mornings when not too hot . The bicycle, skates , and the joggers will inspire you for excercise . Good place for kids . Not for a hurried tourist ."
,,Great Bike Riding & Walking,4.0,,"Rent your bikes from Lifestyle Bike and Skate and do a lap or part there of around the park.. The park is lovely, situated right on the water. Make sure you pack water as it's hot! We had lunch afterwards at Jumbo - chilli crab!"
,,Ride by the beach!,4.0,,"Clean beach. Avoid sundays. Over crowded. Start your day early soak yourself in the warmth of the morning sun. Rent a bike / blade / skate if you would like to enjoy the scenery. Stop by the hawker centre for local food n refreshment. If you continue down the track, it will lead you to Changi Beach. You'll love the breeze in your hair and the view. On the end other end, you can stop by starbucks coffee for a pick me up or some restaurants for bites. Cycle further down the park connector and it will lead you to Marina Bay/ Marina Barrage! Enjoy the scenice ride!"
,,Great Day Out,4.0,,"If you are looking for something to do in Singapore other than shop then please go to East Coast Park.

It runs along the seaside, not the best swimming but okay. We hired pushbikes and road along the park way. We stopped off at the Extreme Skatepark for a look. We also parked our bikes under the trees and watched people at 360 Cable Ski Park.

Most of your ride walk was shaded as the park has huge trees. We took our own lunch and made a day of it.

If hiring a bike and you are a tourist you will need to take your passport otherwise you will have to leave a $100 SGD bond."
,,Bring the family there.,5.0,,"Food, sandy beaches, pubs, sports rental and park benches. Go to get some sweat out and take a shower before heading to the eating spots. From the east coast hawker to upstyle restaurants. Everyone will be satisfied."
,,Enjoy the sea breeze,4.0,,The favourite hangout for cycling and outdoor lovers. Lots of bicycle rentals and mouth watering food serve by various resturant. Enjoy the crowd and the energy from the youths.
,,"Run, walk or cycle along the coast!",4.0,,"This is great place for those looking for a ace to relax or have a spot of exercise.

The park stretches for many kilometers from Fort Road along Marine Parade till around Laguna Country Club.

You can take a leisurely stroll, run, cycle, rollerblade or even swim in the sea.

The are also bicycle and carts for rent. Along the route, you can find fast food restaurants and restaurants where you can sit and dine and enjoy the sea breeze."
,,Beach of Singapore,4.0,,"Its a kind of man made beach and the sea isnt really invitening when you see all the big ships in front of you waiting to go in the harbour but theres a lovely park there. In the weekends you can see alot of families gathering there, holding BBQ, young people having fun. There are joggers, bikers, ... A really nice place to find some cool air and relax.."
,,Beautiful park.,5.0,,"Running along the waterfront in the Joo Chiat area of Singapore the traditional home of Peranakan culture.
Area has separate pathways for the walkers and one for the cycles, plenty of locals using the park, lots of area for picnics, bar-b-q's, exercising, family day out and enjoying the open spaces.
Lovely trees and shrubs along the long stretches of beachfront.
I would highly recommend this park to visit."
,,Best Hangout Location,4.0,,"East Coast Park is located on the east coast of Singapore. The largest park, with various activities from picnics, sporting or culinary. Yes, all can be done :) in one location. Complete sports facilities on land and water. You can skateboarding or beach volleyball. If you do not want to exercise, you can dine while enjoying the beautiful view of the beach at various restaurants, line trees, shelters, barbeque pits around the park."
,,a family-style sea front part where you -can ride a bike or walk looking at the boats anchored in the bay,4.0,,"This is a nice band of seaside when you drive to or from the airport. There is a long stretch of beach and path where you can walk or ride a bicycle. It is a little crowded and the beach is narrow; you can see the harbor and its numerous boats anchored in the bay.

There are a few restaurants on the sea side and many residential building on the other side of the road. The atmosphere is more of a family style relaxing area than the dynamic and urban center."
,,Don't take a towel!,3.0,,"We live five minutes from the ECP and I feel compelled to tell people what it is really like given colleagues came into town the other day and expected to find a beach on which they can sunbathe.

The ECP is not worth your while if you are visiting Singapore quite frankly. Go to Little India, the Arab Quarter or the Macritchie reservoir for something unique and worth your while. Sadly, while the ECP is great for those who live nearby in that it gives their kids a place to run in an overcrowded town, it's really just an extension of the cosmetic, perfectly groomed, superficial veneer that Singapore has cultivated so adeptly.

A microcosm of Singapore it could be. Expats and locals alike trot along the perfectly manicured pedestrian/cycle lanes (pay attention to which you are on or face a fine), low cost foreign labour toils in the background to ensure ""Singapore is our Garden,"" a point which is constantly reiterated to you by placards along the side of the park, McDonald's and Starbucks compete for locals' insatiable appetite for Americanised consumption experiences while rubbish and unidentifiable slicks get washed up on its beach, a close-up reminder of the constant stream of tankers steaming through the Malacca Straights."
,,Must visit,4.0,,An absolute must visit for all cycling enthusiasts. Cycling by the beach followed by delicious chilli crab at Jumbo Seafood or black pepper crab at Long Beach Seafood will sum up a perfect weekend beach trip.
,,Very enjoyable bike ride,4.0,,Had a good time riding on our bikes along the cost despite the hot and humid weather. Make sure you stop by the food centre for a break and enjoy some authentic local street food
,,Weekend barbecue,4.0,,Nice place to catch with friends or family. You can hire a bike & roam around the place. Good barbecue option available aswell. take a tent & u can spend a night aswell. Nice romantic beach.
,,Great family picnic area,4.0,,"Lots and lots of things to do here - from rollerblading, kite flying, bike riding, camping, swimming. There are hire places, cafes, lots of benches and shade. If you are having a function then logon to their website and book a table or two. Very easy."
,,Nice day by the sea,5.0,,"Tons to do here at East Coast Park. The track goes for ages, there are bikes/rollerblades for rent. Lots of trees so it's actually well-shaded. Hired stand-up paddle boards from Mana Mana near the food centre. Toilet blocks are few and far between though. A great day out at the beach!"
,,Great Place To Chill,4.0,,"One of the popular beaches in Singapore. There's chalet, bbq pits, places to fish and etc. There's so much to do there, usually I go there for cycling. There food courts and shops around there when u get hungry."
,,A nice stroll along Singapore's shipping coast,3.0,,"One of the few places in Singapore where you can walk for miles with a view of the sea. Popular with runners, cyclists and families. Best weekday evenings or maybe early mornings? Can be busy at weekends and hot in the middle of the day!"
,,very good,4.0,,"We went east coast before 2 times few years ago. Suitable for family with kids. We rent 4 bicycles for our family. Good place for cycling as the park is huge. We went east coast at night also. Many people strolling along the beach. There are convenient stores, pubs and restaurant also around this area."
,,Very Natural,5.0,,"The walking on the east coast is indeed pleasant. It's very nearby to Parkway Parade mall also. Good eateries available on the park. You can walk, cycle or just rest on the beach, everything just pleasant."
,,great place for a long ramble,5.0,,We had fun walking around the coast at East Coast Park. You can walk for miles and then can also head inland and climb. We went up to some WW2 bunkers that were quite interesting. There are also markers full of historical information both along the coast and up the nearby hills. A good place for a stroll.
,,Nice sea breeze,4.0,,"Good place for a walk in the cooler sea breeze. They could do with a few more seats in the shade, but this is a nice place to relax in Singapore."
,,Great place for fun activities,4.0,,"We spent a full day in East Coast Park enjoying some kayaking, biking and the excellent hawker center over there. If you love to do something active, East Coast Park is a great place. You can do lots of water sports (kayaking, kite surfing, fishing, sailing,…), you can go biking along the beautiful bike roads and you even can rent roller blades. This beautiful park stretches along the East Coast of Singapore and offers lots of opportunities to just relax and enjoy yourself."
,,Good place.,4.0,,"Good place for picnic , get together , evening walk ,morning walk, jogging ,running, skating ,cycling , fishing ,

what more u want :) food shops ! , good toilet ! ,these are also there.

Went by bus 401 .. run only on sat and sun day from bedok bus terminal got down at cable ski park. . while coming boarded bus from - opp. cable ski park bus stop.

must check the sea view from bedok jetty."
,,Really peaceful apart from the planes,4.0,,"Great place to go for a walk along by the coast, they also have tent spots and BBQ pits that you can reserve in advance.

I would assume it's a great place for plane spotters as all the incoming aeroplanes flying in to the nearby airport very low"
,,"Fun place to rent bikes, roller skates, run, swim, or picnic",5.0,,Nice bike paths and beaches. A great place to exercise. Plenty of convenience stores and restaurants. Plus many other activities.
,,Poor experience at the laser tag team,3.0,,The laser tag team is a bit small to do so much fun because u don't get anymore space to shoot your opponents because that's the minimum space u have to shoot your opponents which kind of SUCKS
,,Great for a run,4.0,,"ECP is a really long stretch of greenery along the Singapore coastline. It's good for a picnic with friends and family and for activities such as running, skating, and biking. Lots of food outlets and a few overpriced bike rentals.

Can be skipped if you have limited time in Singapore."
,,Truly a hidden gem even to locals,5.0,,"Often locals take their attractions for granted and I am one of those as well. It took a reading of the book ""Tales from the ECP"" by Russ Soh to help me rediscover the diamond hidden within East Coast Park.
My interest was piqued after reading the stories and I went exploring and found that the park is indeed a refuge for the body, mind and soul. As mentioned by the many reviews, it is a glorious stretch of beach and parkland that one can engage in many activities such as walking, cycling, camping or simply watching the airplanes flying low as they approach Changi Airport. Yes it is overcrowded in the weekends, however if you have time to spare, go on a weekday and spend time re-connecting with nature here.

Useful tips - Areas F to H are the most beautiful and a haven from the crowds. If you are driving, park at Carpark F2, (it's free!) and walk towards Area G on your left and you will be greeted with a beautiful array of colors from the blooming flowers. From there it's a very pleasant walk. If you have a picnic basket, the wooded areas after Area G offers shade and protection from the sun.
Alternatively, you can start from the East Coast Lagoon Food village at Area E2 (accessible by public transport) and rent a bike here. Cycle to explore the above areas. Upon returning the bikes, you can tuck in the many local delights at the Food village."
,,Great Run in the park,5.0,,"Over 10km stretch of greenery along the southern eastern coastal line. Beautiful tracks for you to walk, run or cycle. You can rent the bikes at the many rental kiosk. Plenty to eat and I believe the best local food Singapore has to offer if you take into account the ambience. Nice breeze, have a coconut or a cold beer, a few Satays and watch the world go by (Lagoon hawker Centre). Fantastic people watching place."
,,EAST coast park,4.0,,It has many seafood restaurants with very nice foods at reasonable prices. The mud crabs are very nice and is also famous for its prawns and veges
,,Perfect for Family or Group Bonding!,4.0,,"The sand beach and the atmosphere of this place is perfect for outing and for short getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. My church group has been coming to this place for meetings and to perform some challenging activities like amazing race, dodge ball games and a lot more."
,,rent a bike,3.0,,Good to rent a bike at a few of the outlets along the parkway. Careful on public holidays when can be very busy. Other attractions include a cable waterski park. Wouldn't fancy swimming here - though some do. There are barbeque along the parkway also.
,,Visit the Hawker Centre,4.0,,If you like cheap street food then this is for you. The Hawker Centre os a street food market with plenty of seating and tables. You will find lots of locals here as it can be cheaper to buy prepared food here than to buy it uncooked. The BBQ stingray is great but beware the crayfish is prices by weight so can cost a lot more than you are expecting.
,,Outdoor Fun !,5.0,,"A full day of fun and activities welcomes you to East Coast Park.

Aloof from the busy mainstream city of Singapore, this part is relaxed and pollution free with the cyclists, joggers and kids playing in the area. The cycles could be rented on a hourly basis and thereafter drinks by the beach side. Plenty of restaurants are also there, so as not to worry for food. Adventurous people can rent a BBQ for about 15 dollars a day as well.

A hidden gem in Singapore which should be a must in the itinerary."
,,Best time to visit is Chinese New Year.,4.0,,"In this period, you will virtually have the entire area to yourself. The bike rental shops are still open, as are other drink and ice cream places, not to mention the new Starbucks that had opened.

We even managed to park in the free zone. The only complaint I have is the water quality of the beach and the sight of all the cargo ships parked in front."
,,Away from the frantic pace of mainstream Singapore.,4.0,,"Our hotel was just a few blocks from here.East Coast Road.to wander along this foreshore path,which goes for miles,is such a pleasure.Just about any time of the day or night there will be joggers,bike riders,exercising people and so on.There is seating along the way.Bikes can be hired cheaply.Good to sit and watch the world go by.Nice breezes but the beach I feel is no good for swimming.Think it's polluted from General rubbish and perhaps from the many,many ships moored along the shoreline.You can buy cheap food.A pleasant change from the city etc."
,,The Helix Bridge Singapore,5.0,,"Could walk this 100 times and never get sick of it, day or night. Magnificent at night with the blue lighting and during the day lots of shade sails to keep you cool and heaps of photo opportunities."
,,Relaxed ambience welcomes you on a sunny day!,4.0,,"The relaxed atmosphere with a lot of casual cyclists, joggers, campers & kids welcomes you! The idea of the cement benches well laid out is good, but someone needs to ensure they are spotlessly clean, for us to readily use! The idea of renting out bikes by the hour, helps a lot....as do those conveniently located showers!!"
,,A great place throughout the day and night!,4.0,,"In the morning, this place is packed with people doing morning exercise, cycling, jogging or even doing Tai Chi. In the afternoon, you can see a lot of people picnic and relax by the beach. During evening, there are alot of people enjoying BBQ by the beach. Renting a BBQ pit costs just about $15 for a day. Late night there are also a lot of people siting by the beach to relax and have a drink. There is also a hawker selling varieties of famous singapore food. Seafood restaraunt are also available. Bicycle rental is also available as well. There isn't any MRT around this place but it is walking distance from Marine Parade. It is also quite safe at late night as there are police patrolling the area. A great place for either couples or families."
,,Mixing with the locals.,5.0,,"It's great to walk along the river and just talk to the locals and hear there stories see the ships,the planes coming in to land.
The water skiing park is good but very busy.
Locals camp there at the weekends,especially those that live in the tower blocks it's a good place for barbeques,it's mostly for the locals and maids on Sunday's as they don't work."
,,Peace and quiet in busy Singapore,5.0,,"Hidden gem of Singapore probably not seen by many visitors. A great place for a walk, run or bike ride. Lots of eating places to chose from including the newly built Pakrland Green. Lots of places to hire bikes and roller blades. Quiet on weekdays, busy at weekends"
,,Enjoyable surroundings!,4.0,,"Whether you're having a barbecue, taking a stroll, cycling or dining, East Coast Park assuredly caters to one and all! One of the finest settings for family&friends alike to assemble!"
,,East Coast Park - Family Fun,5.0,,"We hired bikes at the kiosk near the ECP Food Centre (Hawker Market) at around 5pm. Very good price $8 for 1 hr with another hour free! Crocodile bikes and tandems available too. Biked towards Changi, not much change in terrain or scenery but easy cycle and lovely warm wind and great location by the sea. (You'll see this park on your left as you come from Changi Airport to the central city.) There are a couple of refreshment kiosks on the way if you need drinks or ice cream. Returned bikes in time to eat at the ECP Food centre - popular food market. Find a table - take the number of the table, order different dishes from multiple outlets and they deliver to your table number. Try the satay, doesn't matter which retailer - all are great! Chilli Crab good but suprisingly expensive @ $30 when all other food is so cheap. Grab a taxi back as others are arriving, otherwise taxi could be hard to find. Very cheap taxis in Singapore - don't hesitate to use!"
,,"Green,Quiet... Kids, Joggers and Cyclists love it!",4.0,,"15Km long logging and cycling track with green belt on one side and beach on other side , 10 minutes drive from city center, i would still call its location well within the city, for us it was very near as we stayed on East Coast Road....i do not know how many metro cities in the world can boast of such large parks and jogging tracks ....Our kids loved cycling there - you can bring your own or they are available on rentals also. Saw many families there who had come for a picnic...."
,,Cycling along the Coast,5.0,,No vehicle zone with a wide cycling track surrounded by maintained lawns and spread out shopping outlets and eateries. a perfect place to spend a day or half cycling along the coast and whilst taking breaks at various points along the way. Quite a few tents around for those coming over for overnight picnics. An ideal short getaway.
,,Very good park for children and adults alike.,4.0,,"Nice place for spending a day, playing at the beach, cycling around, barbecue, or anything you want to do on a lazy day. Peaceful location and quite surroundings."
,,Nice place for running,4.0,,"I really enjoy this park. The cycling and running paths go all the way from Changi coast walk to Fort road. From the look of it I think it might go beyond these as well. You could get at least 10km from one end to the other. There are shops, cafeterias and restaurants scattered along the way. You can rent bicycles from the regular type to those who can fit the entire family. There are plenty of amenities as well as exercise area. Very well maintained with lots of greenery. If you come here for the beach you will be disappointed as there are no nice beach. The water is not so clean. This is where I first learn stand up paddling with a lot of ships in the background."
,,Nice place for gathering friends,4.0,,"In my opinion this artificial so called beach is the ideal place for friends or family gathering with BBQ. We can do a lot activities out there, cycling, skating, jogging, water sport, and many eatries including famous Long Beach restaurant, Seafood international market and restaurant, Jumbo Seafood restaurant, Crystal Jade Seafood BBQ, No Signboard Seafood, and so on. You can make your own BBQ as well at the BBQ pits (need to book first through SAM). But you wouldn't encounter the big waves or tides at the beach, most of the time the sea is calm. My most favorite activity right here is cycling along the beach (said the cycling track is total 15 km long). During weekends you must expect big crowd."
,,A little over rated........,3.0,,"After many visits to Singapore, we finally managed a meal at Jumbo Restaurant in East Coast Parkway.

It was probably the busiest seafood restaurant there and we were hoping for wonderful things.

Sadly though it didn't happen.

Too busy, food nothing special and the service was nothing notable either."
,,The other side of singapore,4.0,,"Went there today, Dec 27, 2014. Visiting relative at Marine Terrace and cross the bridge to the East Coast Park. At 6 PM, lots of peoples jogging, cycling or even had a BBQ/picnic by the seaside. It was so close to Indonesia, even you can get INDOSAT signal and called on 'local Indonesia rate' - if you happened to have INDOSAT network on your card. Its clean and safe as no cars allowed the jogging track. You can rent a bicycle or grab snacks etc. Enjoy Singapore in different way."
,,Free amusement park,4.0,,Ecp is a must go place especially for those who dont want to strain their pockets too much. This place offers a variety of activities like cycling skating barbecues sand castle making etc. Also there are lots available for camping. When you go into the waters make sure you do not venture too deep since it suddenness plunges into depths. One can also get a good view of the ships as they are very close. You can take a bus or taxi from Eunos mrt and it is very cheap
,,Free Amusement Park,5.0,,"The government of Singapore obviously decided that its citizens needed a playground. I navigated this huge park on a bicycle. There is a water-ski course that is mechanically operated, bikes to rent, boats to rent, the entirety of the park is connected by bike trails, there is a yacht club, an R/C car track, restaurants, and many other things. It is a little crowded on weekend so go a little earlier before it gets really hot."
,,East Coast Park,5.0,,"Its a great place to hang out with family on weekends, just to chill, skate or cycle. There are also water sports that you can take part in. Can be pretty crowded on weekends though."
,,Fun Place To People Watch,3.0,,This artificially created coastline near Changi Airport in Singapore is always full of locals on their day or night off and is full of fun and people watching. The funniest things I saw here were the dogs riding in the front of the bicycle carts along with other family members. I have been to many points along East Coast here but my favorite is eating food at the East Coast Seafood Center. Take your bug repellant as there are many opportunities to get bug bites along the walking/jogging paths.
,,Wonderful place for a relaxing outdoor activity,4.0,,"This is the place that I visit quite frequently. It is nicely designed along the coast with a proper blend of greenery on one side and coastal line along the other. The walkway is nicely planned even though sometimes it can be little dangerous with the zipping bicycles. There are many restaurants around this place and quite a indoor sports activities too. You could rent a bicycle and go for a long cycling ride or go for a long walk along the coast. The easiest way to get to this location is to take a taxi (unless you drive) as public bus may not be that frequent unless you would not mind to get down somewhere nearby and walk across ECP to reach this spot. Ideal itinerary would be to reach there around 4:00 PM, take up the bicycle ride for 2 hours, enjoy the dusk (if you lucky with some nice cool wind), have dinner at one of the restaurants and head back around 9:00 PM. I am sure this is the place if you need a short relaxing outdoor activity."
,,"Best for sunrise, jogging, picnics and family!",5.0,,"I simply love this place! The sunrise is so beautiful here... hence i'm there for my regular jog at sunrise! come around 6.30-7am to catch it.. It's also a good place for sports like cycling, jogging, skating, sea sports etc... good for picnic, BBQ, camping too! One of singaporeans' favourite weekend places.. There's also a tennis centre, sailing centre, chalets, skate board area.. and many restaurants/bars.. a new eating arena just opened recently.. a must visit place for all!!"
,,Good for foodies,5.0,,I spent my last evening here walking along the beach and sampling traditional and modern singaporean food! a must visit for a local flavour and also to get out of the city hustle. Cabs are not always available
,,Did a big loop of 50km cycling,4.0,,"It was great fun cycling along the ECP towards north to Changi Village. We the cycled along the Park Connector Network, we went to Pasir Ris and Bedok Reservoir then back to ECP. We stopped at a food center inside a residential area near Sunplaza Park for lunch and the pepper crab revitalized our taste buds and prices were very reasonable.

The first part of the ride till Changi Village was great as there was minimal traffic to bother but the second half was a bit adventurous as the path was poorly signed and there were quite a lot of road and bridge crossing. The bike rental at ECP (and probably Singapore) is quite costly."
,,Pleasant walk or cycle,3.0,,"A traffic free area along the coast, run, cycle or walk, take a picnic and sit in one of the many seating areas along the park, there are also bbq facilities if you are so inclined. A few restaurants in the park, a nice way to chill out if you don't fancy a trip into the City."
,,Relaxing moments,5.0,,"I was in Singapore for 2 weeks for training. I stayed in Capri hotel in Changi Business Park. When it came to week end, one of my friend suggested me to go to East Coast Park for exercise.

I took a cab (too bad no convenient public transport to the park other than cab). When I arrived, the fresh air and relaxing atmosphere was immediately coming to me. I rent bicycle for 1 hour for SGD 8 and did bicycling along the track. There's separate track for jogging and cycling to avoid unexpected incident. You would see foodstall and bicycle shop every 2-3 km so no need to worry if you feel thisrty or hungry. The track is approx 12km long so should be enough to make you sweating.

I did enjoyed my time here and i highly recommend you to visit this park when you come to Singapore."
,,Take a break from the City!,5.0,,"We used to live in an apartment opposite East Coast 100mtrs so used the East Coast for walking, running and cycling, you can hire bikes at a reasonable price ome very nice stretches of sand for bathing, not so sure how clean the sea is because of the vast number of container ships anchored off East Coast but I had several dips to cool down and no problems. The view along the East Coast is brilliant, lots to see & do from skate parks, lakes, parks, restaurants & bars, BBq areas, very well known for sea food, some great restaurants!!. You can walk/cycle from the City along large walkways between 5 & 10 Km easy and further if you want, lots of tree shade. Many Singaporians pitch tents at the weekend and camp overnight to enjoy the BBq areas and sea breeze if any!!. there are many toilet & shower facilities. Very safe even at night, enjoy."
,,Great place for cycling,4.0,,This is one of the best places in Singapore for cycling with long straight stretches of dedicated cycle path and no annoying traffic lights in the way. You can ride all the way through to the ferry terminal at Changi Village (and then continue on by small boat to Pulau Ubin if you like). Go early to avoid the crowds.
,,"Kayaking, cycling, roller blading, worth a full day",5.0,,"Hawker centres with cheap clean food, juice and beer and wine. The sea and sur at arm's length. Kayas for hire into the sea, cyles for hire every few kilometers by the hour. you can also put up a tent for a weekend on hire and there are also lodge rooms for hire for weekends and a stunt cycling area. lots of clean toilets all over the place."
,,Sunday morning run,5.0,,"I would say its the best running/walking route in Singapore. No traffic lights, dedicated track for joggers.

Ample facilities for all ages, food and beverages slightly pricy but good variety when u head down to the hawker centre near the lagoon.

Idea place for flying kites and/or just a walk by the beach."
,,Good place for a day of relaxation,5.0,,"The place is fantastic for a day of walking, cycling or just hanging around. A day of picnic is also a good way of spending a day to this place."
,,Good place to cycle and chill,4.0,,I always find myself cycling to East Coast Park whenever I am stressed. It gives me a sense of tranquility and a break from the busy city life. Weekends are not very good to go though since it would be very crowded. Definitely a must-go during weekdays when you want to chill and relax.
,,Nice,5.0,,Nice place for a family day out. Can go biking walking and swimming here. You can bring your own food or buy on the stalls nearby
,,Lovely place to spend a day,5.0,,"This place is recommended for family day out, friends bonding or company getaway. Can have a BBQ session here and can do jogging, walkathon and picnic."
,,Probably the best Singapore has to offer,5.0,,"If you have the time, keep an entire day for ECP. Take a walk on the beach, use the barbecue pits and cook up a feast (remember to thoroughly clean it first!) (available on first come first serve basis), cycle or skate around (also available on hire - at fairly reasonable prices), be delighted by the wide array of restaurants."
,,Activity hub,4.0,,Absolutely great place with nice jogging and cycling track along the cost. Nice beach for kids to play. Cycling and skating gear available on rent. Boats and kayaks also available. Good place to enjoy some good physical activity. Great food choices as well.
,,An entirely different Singapore experience,4.0,,"Singapore is not entirely shopping malls and not all places worth visiting there requires an entry ticket. East Coast Park is a lovely promenade, miniature forest and picnic spot all rolled into one. The icing on the cake are highly reviewed traditional eating joints dotting it's entire stretch."
,,Nice walk. Healthy air,5.0,,"The place is so wonderful. Recommended for a family dayout. Can go biking, strolling, swimming and picnicing here."
,,Good place for a bonding day;),5.0,,I have been to this place for a lot of times already. I can say that this place is not only suitable for a family dayout but also for bonding with friends. The place is recommended for bikers and joggers too
,,Love the Beach,5.0,,"I really love the beach, this is very nice beach with jogging track and bbq area. We can play in the white Sand or walking arround. Just walk from Marrine Place area is so Fun."
,,Great family outing,5.0,,"Great place to cycle or skate. It can get very crowded during the evenings. Bike rentals are available but most are rusty & dirty which cost s$8/hour for child size & s$10/hour for adults.

Can cycle fir really long stretch or even to the jetty to watch people fishing.

Great outdoor fun!"
,,Cycling :),4.0,,Try to reach this place much before sunset so that you can take a round and properly see the whole park. Its a beautiful park with multiple options to choose from entertainment & food. Here you can actually rent a cycle for a family. we rent a cycle where we 3 enjoyed our 1 whole hour ride in the park. that kind of cycle for 2 adults and one child will cost you 12SGD for 1 hour but it is so much fun. We had our dinner there only at Jumbos. One can actually spend their whole evening there.
,,Must bike ride to see it all,5.0,,Highly recommended park to visit. Plenty of places to rent a bike although they are generally old and slow. Much better to rent a better bike through spinlister
,,Best place for Cycling...,5.0,,"ECP is very relaxing. Can roam around for atleast 3 hours.

It has been a very pleasant experience cycling in ECP. We took cycles for 2 Hours for 16 SGD(8 SGD/hr) we cycled almost 18 Kms in the ECP Stretch. Whenever we got time we use to go to ECP. I would prefer early morning or late evening times for cycling here."
,,Natural place inside highly developed Singapore,5.0,,"It is a nice places with lots of food stalls located nearby the beach of Singapore. Lots of people will be enjoying their time during weekends. Cycling at least for an hour is highly recommended around the park. There are cycle hiring shops available at very reasonable prices. I paid about US$ 20 for an hour cycling. Beaches are right in front of you, enjoy people playing with bluish water. For people looking for beautiful places not influenced by highly developed city then it's absolutely recommended."
,,Nice beach!,3.0,,"Great view to Sea and to ships! I spend night there with group of friends, on the beach there were other people as well sleeping! Bring your food and drink with you, there are small shops with high prices. If you like to grill there, you need to do reservation to grilling pit."
,,Singapore's beach,5.0,,"Singapore has few beaches that are swim able, this is one if the longest. Changing facilities available. Good for family outing and picnics. Eateries along the stretch of beach."
,,Beautiful scenery n fresh air,4.0,,"Do cycling or roller skate there, it's a wonderful place to do all these activities. There're restaurants around for seafood."
,,Family Trip,4.0,,Really enjoy myself cycling with my Malaysian Family at ECP. It's both cheap and good. The beautiful sea view and cooling sea breeze keeps mind relax and we can even have a great view of the planes flying above us in the sky!!!
,,Dirty dirty dirty!,1.0,,This park is getting worst and worst - I hate running here but I do like running into the sands to train my feet! People just don't care about the beach and its surroundings...baby diapers and tons and tons of plastic bottles! I wish people would care more about the earth!!!
,,Great weekend outdoor activities,3.0,,Great place to get outdoors and away from city. Evenings and late night bike riding along boardwalk was nice when crowds were gone. Weekdays and after 9:00pm best time to peace and quiet.
,,Is this Singapore?,1.0,,"Certainly Singapore can do more....and the usual way is to employ good people to clean the beaches in Singapore..Well there are some signs of improving the beach but the overall is too much to handle.The water is murky and not pure.Even the water in Penang is better.
Surely Singapore can improve this beach.The website too is not functioning.Does the Government in Singapore need better employees?Just ask me via this site.
Visitors come with expectation.However the wash up from the ships and other items is too much to ignore.While I did wet my feet in the beach waters later, there is need for caution.
The walk from any nearby MRT is tiresome And can be very scary to walk back to civilization..Also too many joggers are here and not the real beach people.Wish there were buggy rides to the MRT area or more crowded parts."
,,Hari Raya Weekend Cycling...,3.0,,"I was kinda disappointed with a lot of renovations going on at East Coast park. Big Splash was down for renovation (I didn't saw any news update on that), Parkland Green and Marine Cove was on renovation until 2016 (where the old McDonald's restaurant and bowling alley used to be). Area A park is closed until further notice.

The nearest place to rent a bike from Parkway parade will be at Raintree Cove where BK is located. This also means that the nearest toilet will be at BK itself but the super long queue means you have to pray very hard that the person ahead of you will use the toilet fast enough.

Holiday weekend also means super big crowd especially towards the Seafood centre and the Hawker centre. There is literally not much cycling spaces around Area C to Area E so one have to awfully slow down to prevent accidents especially with the wagon riders and jaywalkers cutting across the grass without watching out for cyclist.

However, as one cycling away from the crowded zones, it is very enjoyable where there are a lot of trees and minimium human traffic.

Bike rental will depends on which stores that one visit and what promotion that one will receive.

I went to CycleMax @ Raintree cove area for 2 bike rental (2 mountain bikes - 1 with basket; another one without). Total cost : SGD31 for 3 hours (rent 2 hours and get 1 hour free)

For updates on the Npark maps, refer to my post:

,,Unique Sunrise,4.0,,"Surprisingly, the sunrise was lovely. You can experience the unique view of people swimming with massive oil tankers in the distance."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"This place is a credit to the fathers of the city. Miles of shaded, treed beautiful parklands to enjoy alongside the bay. We spent about five hours here waking for approximately 30km and biking for two hours. There are numerous places to pick up and drop off your bike At a reasonable rate. Only $17 from memory. Multiple eateries to stop and refresh at and also public toilets which can be hard to find elsewhere. All this with view of the hundreds of ships waiting in the roads and a balmy sea breeze to cool you down. Best place we visited in Singapore."
,,New Pizza Place in Sandhills,4.0,,"We had a small East Coast pizza and a really nice East Coast salad. You talk about a large salad this one was LARGE. It was enough for 4 people. The pizza was fine as any place not a five star but I will give it a 4.

The facility was a location of another failed pizza franchise.
I may revisit but it is just an every day typical pizza place."
,,Nice walking and biking trails,4.0,,"I am staying at a nearby hotel. I walk daily on the walking trails along the beach. Pleasant tree covered trails separated for walking, jogging and biking. Not too crowded during the week. There are bicycle rentals, canopy bicycle cars, mommy and me exercise groups, play grounds, outside gyms and even a water board overhead tow area lake. You can also rent paddle boards and kayaks but as previous posters indicated, the water is not clear.
Not necessarily a swimming beach but a great park like setting to enjoy. As all Singapore beaches, the tankers consume the water view. Lots of activity !"
,,"Cycling, food",3.0,,"We rent a two person bicycle and cycling around there.good experience. But the bike condition so so only. Anyway is not expensive to rent the bike, haha. We had our dinner in that area. Difficult to get a seat and food is similar to other Asian food. Basically mostly fried and grill. The cleanliness is the area they need to improve."
,,"Best enjoyed by bike, one of the best things we did",5.0,,"We enjoyed a few hours at East Park cycling and lunching. It is an easy flat ride, mostly shaded and the view of the cargo ships and overhead flights over the water is pretty cool. We combined it with lunch at Red Lantern which was quite good.

I can't imagine swimming in the water though."
,,Lovely place for cycling,5.0,,"We always enjoy cycling here! There are separate tracks for cyclist and for people taking a stroll or jogging.

It's lovely view of the beach. You can place a mat and get a tan here too!

There are many stalls where you can rent a bicycle and enjoy exploring. We love the 24 hours roti prata place!"
,,"This review is for ""Swimming in the Ocean"" at ECP",3.0,,"As a temporary resident of Singapore, I sometimes forget that we are an island. Recently I have been exploring the different beaches here, and so far I feel that East Coast Park is the best place in Singapore to spend a couple hours on the beach. The water here is cleaner here than Sentosa, I think because the current is stronger here. I was very happy to find that there is no oil sheen on the surface of the water here, like you will see on Sentosa. However, my son did crawl on his knees a bit and came up with a pretty solid oil smudge on his knee, which wouldn't wipe away. I don't recommend going underwater … keep your ears and eyes dry, for your over all health. There are no shells to collect, however we have consistently found pieces of granite, which is kind of fun. Last weekend we met a local man who was net fishing, and he caught a baby pufferfish! That was fun for us. We enjoy spending about 2 hours at a time on the beach, it's usually pretty quiet (don't go on Sundays, it's over run with helpers & construction workers). It's a nice get away with a great breeze, view of the ships and storms rolling in."
,,Absolutely Disgusting,1.0,,East Coast Park is a sad excuse for a beach. The water is covered with hundreds of container ships. The waves froth with garbage. I can't believe people actually swim in this water. Other foreigners who live in Singapore told us that their skin broke out in rashes after going into the water. People along with every kind of bike imaginable swarm over the shore. WWF should run a video on this place. It would make for a good environmental-dystopia commercial. I actually can't believe how locals could possibly like this wastebin.
,,Fatal Accident Brewing,2.0,,"East coast park is a wonderful place for weekends. However, please be reminded the cycling lanes is overly crowed on weekends and holidays. It is cluttered with : children on small bikes, weekend riders on rented and poorly maintained bicycles. large cycling wagons that hog the lanes, very fast bicycles (usually by expats) trying to show off, skate boards, roller skaters....etc the situation is manageable in the day. But when night falls, many bicycles still cycle at high speed in TOTAL DARKNESS with no lights in many stretches. Collisions are near miss or happened head on. Many unreported accidents happened such as fractures or deep lacerations. Its only a matter of time a fatal accident will happen. It is very dangerous to ride on East Coast Park, but local Asians dont care because most lack of safety mindset. Be extra careful when you cross the lanes, as a bicycle may appear from nowhere and hit you."
,,A great place to relax..,5.0,,I go to east coast park almost every weekend as this offers skating classes to my son whilst I can enjoy the cool breeze with the great surroundings for a long walk or Cycling which you can rent from the outlets. The facilities available there for convenience is also commendable and the car park is free except for select areas
,,toilets and barbeque pits,4.0,,"For quite sometime, I have not been to East Coat Park as I stay in the western sector of Singapore. We have a barbeque party recently with few groups of residents and we enjoyed the serene and windy night by the beach. However, we found that the barbeque pits were quite far from the sanitary facilities. It may be due to the multi-storey car park upgrading, we could not find any toilets near our barbeque pits and have to walk quite a distance to reach the nearest toilet. I walked about 10 mins to use the toilet at the Macdonald outlet as my hands were dirty after distributing the charcoals for the barbeque. I also noticed that the sunset view at East Coast Park was not very nice. I normally look out for beautiful sunset at beaches but could hardly see the sunset at the beaches at East Coast Park. May be since it is East Coast Park; I should probably look out for the sunrise from the East instead of sunset. Nevertheless, the park has improved tremendously, clean and well-maintained. It is very much relaxing feeling the soothing wind and strolling along the beach pavement."
,,BBQ in Singapore,4.0,,"Visit East Coast Park when your in Singapore were you can hire Bicycles, roller Blades or have a BBQ.Catch a bus go for a long walk or catch a taxi to the East Coast Park.
over looking the Ocean as you try and count how many ships are at anchor in one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world.On a clear day you can see Indonesia Batam Island.
There is a Bowling ally,Mini Mart and Many Restaurants over looking the East Coast to suit your fancy & your pocket.
You can even wet a line and do a spot of fishing off the beach or one of the many break walls along the East Coast Park."
,,Relax,5.0,,Superb place to relax at weekend. I had a very nice BBQ restaurant here. What you need to do spend hours at this place and relax your senses
,,Simply Comfortable,5.0,,"Great place to forget all tiring thing. We did a camp and overnight , its so relaxing with sea wind . Just lay down and feel the life , forget all the thing that makes you tired. If any tourist travel to Singapore, you should visit or overnight here. Best place for relaxing and party weekend"
,,Wonderful place to spend time,5.0,,ECP is an amazing place to spend time. We can rent cycle in nearby shop and go for cycling which I totally love. Also the view is so beautiful.
,,always happy with east coast,5.0,,"spent 1 whole night my friend at east coast. all our kid memory just came back to my own eyes. we did bbq here , celebrated my friend bday with special song and cake. if we have time to write maybe we will write a story about this coast, for what i always remember and keep into my heart. east coast where i grew up where keep my memory to this litle lovely island"
,,Great Sunday,5.0,,This is a great place to spend a Sunday biking or rolling blading with the family. The beaches are nice (water is still dirty thou). The bike paths and pedestrian paths are well separated so everything flows smoothly. There are a ton of places to eat and it's a great area to just go outside and enjoy the warm humid air ;)
,,Scenrenity Now,5.0,,"A great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, Take the MRT to Bedok station and a taxi ride straight to the bike hire next to the beach was $5. We hired bikes for 2 hours and that was ample to cruise along the pathway exploring and taking in the sights. Bedok shopping mall has excellent and cheap places to eat, the Korean cafe we went to was one of the best meals we had."
,,Nice for Singapore,4.0,,I wasn't expecting much just some sand and water and that's all i got. Theres a lot of ships so the beach kinda loses its touch.
,,"Great location for picnic, cycling",4.0,,"Hired a bike for 13$ for 3 hours. Did 30 Km awesome ride. It is a bit crowded near sections D where people tend to bump into you even on cycling track. Otherwise, it has got some real good cycling trek."
,,A must visit place apart from shopping centers.,4.0,,"If you're thinking of renting a bike for two. Go for two person bike or the family bike. Not advisable to rent a two person tricycle. It was a little bit costly and even the family bike can go faster than us. We were supposed to eat our lunch at a food court which is 10mins away with the normal bike speed. However, it took us more than 30 mins to reach there in our tricycle. It was too tiring to explore the place with a tricycle so we headed back to the rental shop and changed it to single bike after lunch.

For those who like water skiing, remember to bring your swimsuit along. And i was told that at the end of this park is the Changi airport. I didn't go that far, but i don't mind exploring this place further next time."
,,Always nice and clean,5.0,,"Always visit on weekdays. I guess weekends may be too crowded. Enjoy cycling or walking. There is separate paths for cars, bikes and foot. So is very safe, especially for young children. There are many bicycle kiosk you can rent a bike or bring your own and enjoy the beautiful surroundings."
,,Amazingly Relaxing place,5.0,,"If you be in Singapore, you gotta visit this place... Superb scenic beauty, awesome food, superb windy breeze, cool place to hangout"
,,Great place after reno,5.0,,"East Coast Park was always one of my favorite spots when I lived in Singapore between 1998-2002. It was also on my bucket list every time I came back for a visit. The magnet was always the food there. Not that it was overly unique or superb. It was just a sheer variety of it. Just made another visit for CNY 2014 and was very impressed with the renovations. Place lost a bit of its ""beach like"" character you see in Indonesia or Malaysia but... it is not necessarily a bad thing. You got a very nice and practical seating, with hygienic surfaces and ... plate collection centers taken right from your IKEA restaurant. Variety of food is just outstanding. Highly recommend to see.If you are renting a car (crazy idea in Singapore with their excellent metro, bus and cheap taxi services) or have a car, plan on coming before 5 pm as parking can be a big challenge."
,,Nature's Beauty At It's Best,5.0,,"Loads of recreation options, innumerable eateries & amazing shopping will still not be an enough to surround this beautiful place. Haven't seen a calmer, serene place than this. Even if you are alone, you can spend hours at this place and relax your senses - just by enjoying the beauty that Nature offers here..."
,,Largest park in Singapore,4.0,,"I went there with my friend to relax and enjoy the time there. It's a popular place for locals and tourtists and it offers sports activities like cycling, inline skating etc. There are good restaurants there and you can enjoy barbeque food and beverages.
The park is easily accessible by East Coast Park Service Road with numerous exits along the East Coast Parkway. We had dinner at Jumbo sea food restaurant and the food offered was good. Go there and enjoy the largest park in city of Singapore."
,,amazing skate park,4.0,,"Honestly the biggest and best skate park we have been to, I don't skate but my partner does a lot and he was stoked with this park. spent a few hours here over our trip because it was so good! if It wasn't humid there I swear we would have spent all our time there."
,,Relaxed beach with lots of activities,5.0,,"Cycling, bowling, picnic, camping, skating,playing with sand, stoll along the pathways ...... A whole lot of activities you can do at east coast park. It's where the locals prowl during the weekends to unwind too.

Plenty of food, restaurants, like jumbo seafood restaurants, MacDonald. Further down there's a hawker centre with more food choices. And if u go in the evening, you can get local spread like satay, grilled chicken wings etc."
,,East Coast Park,4.0,,"Park at East Coast is actually one of the few places in Singapore where you can actually relax, bike, meditate for free. There is also enough parking and a restaurant in case you wanted to eat, with a nice view of ships trying to duck at their port. Fronting beach is a great view you cant literally swim because its too deep but at least a good photo will do."
,,Great quick escape,4.0,,"My parents live in a condo just near this place. U can do anything here: camping, swimming, jogging, cycling, bbq.. The place is so green and the food centre has so many good foods! Awesome place for leisure, but can be overly crowded in weekends."
,,Nice Place !,3.0,,"Nice beach. Good place for cycling , picnics and just for relaxing. Nice place for conducting events as well.May get overcrowded at times but there is lot of space to just roam around. Eateries are dotted along the shore as well."
,,Excellent use of space.,5.0,,"The Good =)
~Cycling & exercising are the top 2 activities here.
~Promotes healthy living for those living in the East,
beautiful seaside scenery & is a gd place to escape city living.

The Bad =(
~Too crowded during weekends.

My Tip for future visits:
~Sunscreen/Sunblock is a must."
,,Bicycle,5.0,,"If you are after some good exercise time with your family and kids, this is the best recommendation for you. This is my fourth time visit and we each rent a bike for 3 hours. Ride along the coastline with light breeze. Enjoy the sunshine and happy faces from the local community. This is a place where we can feel healthy, love and peace. Don't miss it. Tell the taxi driver to go ""Big Splash"" where there are bike rental, restaurants and coffee shops etc..."
,,"Tar, trash and bottled urine!",1.0,,"I live by this beach, and walk there every weekend to take my daughters to gymnastics class. The beach is always littered with trash, from styrofoam cups to booze bottles to construction debris. Two weeks ago, the beach was covered with tar balls, which ruined our shoes. Today, there was a 5 gallon bucket of oil paint dumped right at the shoreline, along with bottles of urine, from a nearby restaurant that is under renovation (Clay Put Fun at Big Splash). Paint was everywhere -- in the water, on the sand, the smell was in the air. So I pulled the bucket out of the water and dropped it in one of the dumpsters that is always on the beach, and called the park service to report the illegal dumping. And I waited, and waited, and nothing ever happened. Singapore's beaches are filthy, and there is nothing that anyone is doing to change that, even when dumping is reported. I would never swim in this water, and I have resolved never again to even walk the sand in my shoes (even my dog is now covered in paint!)"
,,Relaxing place for both locals and visitors,4.0,,Long stretched park along the east coast of Singapore. One of the most popular outing places for Singaporeans on weekend. It is a pity to know this place more and more crowded recently. Less crowded part is northern parts closer to the airport.
,,Perfect place for great food and fun,5.0,,"This is the place you must visit when you are in Singapore. Although it's a man-made beach, you are upclose to the sea so you can enjoy a nice walk, jog, cycling and feel the seabreeze. What I like is the array of local food you can find either at the hawker center close by or the many seafood restaurants on the beach. You have to try the famous Singapore chilli crab! It's finger-licking good."
,,Must go!,4.0,,Love spending time with family here. There are chalets available for rental. We have BBQ's here and it was fun spending time with family here. Get a bicycle and ride along the park. You'll be surprised.
,,Man Made Beach- Good for Family Outing with Small Kids,5.0,,"Small man made beach, you will love spending you evening on the beach with coffee, nuggets etc... Your kids can enjoy at polliwogs (kids play area) and you with friends can enjoy sea, or take a small dip in water. You can also hire a bicycle and take a ride around. Its nice place."
,,Perfect place for outing,5.0,,"East coast park or ECP as it is known by everyone in Singapore. We have been to this place umpteen times and it is always wonderful to spend a relaxed weekend here with family and friends.
Excellent place for picnic, BBQ, parties, cycling, birthday celebrations and kids loves to do sand play on the beach. On a windy day the place is full of kite lovers.
Overall a great place."
,,Beautiful park and beach!,5.0,,"It is one of the most relaxing place in Singapore. There are a lot of things that can be played here, for example, cycling and skating along the beach while enjoying the sea breeze. It is truly amazing! You can have some water activities like surfing and sailing, you can also try fishing at the jetty there too. At night, you can also camp by the seaside and also have a BBQ party with your friends and family.
The only disappointment is the view is full of cargo ships since the park is near the port."
,,"Fun, Fun, Fun...",5.0,,"I love to take my kids to East Coast Park. There're so many activities you could do, not just tracking, but cycling, surfing, sailing, BBQ with friends and family...etc. Plus many Bars and Restaurants along the coast. We usually spend the whole day in the park. Start from cycling, then setup a tent, let the kids play in the sand beach, buy foods from the nearby food stalls, read my favorite books, listen to music, sleep and rest in beach..."
,,my escape in sing,5.0,,I came back twice.once rented bicycle and next day blades.it is really nice maintained and perfect for any types of outdoor activities.swimming is very doubtful as the water is dirty. Love trees and the size of park!will definitely come back again!
,,For the families and relaxation,5.0,,"Have been staying near this place for nealy 5 years. It is the weekend best family place to go, may it be cycling ( singles, doubles, 4 or 5 in a 3 or 4 wheels) , camping and BBQ places. There are also restaurants along the coasts which you can pick to settle down for some food and beer. It is the most frequent used place for locals too. Early morning joggings for senior folks, school children, Tai Tai ( stay home mums), working executive before they start their day as well as visitors. The beach is for convenience, it is not the resort type of sands you expect."
,,A different side of Singapore,5.0,,"There is a lesser known side of Singapore- a very relaxed side. The East Coast Park is an outdoor recreational park. There's just so much to do there. We rented a bicycle and went almost the entire stretch. Along the way, there are lots to eat - Fast food, hawker centre,fine dining, seafood restaurants. On weekday mornings, it's very peaceful and relaxing, even romantic. On weekends, the sprawling park will be filled with tourist, expatriates and locals alike, camping, roller blading, jogging or just playing by the sand. people seem very relaxed and happy here.
At some point, farther towards Changi, we stopped to see airplanes flying off, just above large ships and in the night, we had lovely chilli crabs in one of the restaurants by the sea.
Driving there is the best option. If not, there are plenty of taxis around. Evenings are cooler, and towards year end, it can be chilly. If you are an outdoor person, this is a great place to enjoy."
,,Enchanting EPC,4.0,,"Beach is real here without any artificial fittings.The only one place in Singapore where you can enjoy the nature in its own way.calm beach with many attractions to all sort of people.you can do night cycling,scatting,family cycling&swimming."
,,"Relax or get adrenaline pumping, your choice!",5.0,,"There are numerous bike rental shops along east coast park; but if you wish to go up to Changi Beach Park, do rent from the park connector shops which allow you to drop off your bike at a similar park connector shop at Changi. This way you won't have to worry about heading back all the way.

East coast park can be really beautiful at night too - suitable for couples who just want a nice quiet place to rest and relax."
,,wonderful,4.0,,"East Coast park is along the sea shore of Singapore,To go around you get wheels of many kind on hire you can skate cycle, tandem cycle or take a family cycle for two or four people on hire.It has a dedicated cycle track very close to the beach so while cycling you get a very nice view of the sea.Hired a family cycle for two on a weekday, the rent was 30 sgd for an hour but on weekdays you pay for one hour and you get one hour free on top of it got a coupon of a restaurant in which one main course or two snacks , a cold drink and an ice cream were included .This nearly covered up the rent for the cycle.There are many barbeque pits and camping sites stores where you get everything needed for barbeque and Camping.I was amazed to see the colour of water .I had visited on a Sunny afternoon ,i feel visiting the place in the evening would be still better.If you are the type who would prefer to just laze around you can sit near the beach for hours ."
,,Nice Place To Enjoy =Relax = Have Fun & Picnic With Family and Friend,4.0,,"East Coast Park is free beach on Singapore’s southeastern coast and the most popular park in Singapore.We went in the morning of 1st Sunday of June this year . I found it a very comfortable relaxing place .My local host told me it is one of the best sea beach and place to enjoy any time in the day and specially on New Years eve night when there are spectaluar fire work show from ships in the ocean in the front and night of New Year is full of fun and party.
We took on hire 4 seater Cycle rickshaw from the cycle-riksha hiring shop ;all of us ;children and adults enjoyed the pulling the rickshaw & cycling turn by turn and had fun .Some of us ;aged ;who could not pull rickshaw posed with it as if cycling as souvenir . In addition Children enjoyed skating.There were children and teen aged doing “Roller Blades”
The beach is fairly big ; greenery and plantation make it more comfortable in comparison to heat of Singapore City . It is a good breakaway place from hustle and bustle of city.Drinks and food of good quality is available near by. Even kids may enjoy plane descending at near by Air Port . .Over all it is a good place to have picnic and enjoyment whole day and even camp with friends ; family and kids"
,,Very nice place for relaxation,5.0,,"The first impression East Coast Park gave me is too comfortable. Sit on the bench,listen to your favorite music and face to the sea. There's another special feelings. I will come again..."
,,Ski360 Wakeboarding Park and Harrys at East Coast Park,4.0,,"Ski360 provides an hour of entertainment ($42 on weekends, $32 on weekdays) for wakeboarding in a pool like setting on a pully system. Ive never seen anything like it and its quite fun. If you aren't into wakeboarding, you can enjoy beers/drinks and food from Harry's while sitting outside. The nacho's are terrible but the chips/fries and pizza aren't bad. Definately a fun thing to do espeically if you haven't been to ECP. If Harry's isn't your thing, head over to the Hawker Stand for local flare food - be prepare to hunt for a table (Or bring a blanket and eat on the beach) and be prepared to stand in line for a long time if looking to try a more popular dish!"
,,Ok. Bit disappointed,3.0,,Walked here from the apartment. I suppose it would be ok for families t to escape the city at weekends as there are plenty of wide walkways for kids to ride a bicycle or skate but the beach is dirty and strewn with rubbish. Had a quick beer but wouldn't bother going back.
,,Perfect place to drink fresh drinks,5.0,,"My friends and I had iced longgan, fresh sugar cane drink.. . I think the milo dinosaur drink will be the most ordered drinks for kids."
,,Good for a big group BBQ,3.0,,"Sand and sea overlook many industrial ships so the water is dirty and not appealing. However plenty of BBQ pits and lots of bike hire and other activities make it a good place for a BBQ with friends. Go as a group, enjoy it for what it is"
,,breakaway from the hustle n Bustle,5.0,,"Great place for family bonding while enjoying the great view of beach and lots of activity and after you get tired the amount of food available just within the area are fabulous, wide range of chinese and malay cuisine makes your stomach go rocking inseide."
,,Perfect Ride and View planes landing just behind you :),5.0,,"Great for biking, really really long stretch to ride, you can rent the bikes there for about 12$/hr each depending on the type. It's got food stalls BBQ pits you could use. Great view of the ocean and ships coming into the harbour, perfect at night with the lights in the ocean looking like reflections of the stars. At the end of the riding stretch is the airport, you can see the planes coming in every single minute and it's really close just going a few hundred meters above your head, cool experience. You could also bring your own fishing line and catch and reel in your fish :) . Also good for night camping and perfectly safe too. Nice sandy beach too, but no swimming.
Do not litter, Singapore is a great country and takes basic rules of society very seriously, you could get up to a 500$ fine."
,,People mountain people sea,3.0,,"If there were 50% less people and ban children under 12 years old entirely, it would have been a nice beach to go, to chili out, to enjoy the breeze. Otherwise, I would prefer my sofa and tv"
,,Loved the bike rental facility,5.0,,The park has so much to offer from a cable-pulled water skiing facility to gardens but being able to rent a bike made the experience so much better. I took the #48 bus from Victoria and Ophir and got off at St Patrick School stop (#92081) walked the canal path over the expressway and the bike rental facility was easy to find. $8 rental for two hours.
,,Pleasant time guaranteed if you like to take a stroll or cycle,4.0,,The review title says it all. A pleasant time guaranteed if you like to take a stroll. You could rent a bike there and go around the parkway along the beach side and spend some time
,,Great outdoors,5.0,,The social place for most of Singapore on the east of the island. Attracts people from the entire island to experience peaceful walks by the sea as well as to enjoy Barbecues and weekend camping. Does get a bit dirty over the weekends due to poor habits of users but the park authorities do a great job of clearing it up pretty quickly. Greta for cycling and roller blading - al of which can be hired from outlets at the park.
,,Good place to people watch,3.0,,Our hotel was near here so we decided to breakfast in the park. It was great people watching with many singaporneans exercising and using the bbq pits. The sea breezes were welcome relief from the humidity. The beach has alot of rubbish and it looks like swimming is not allowed. We enjoyed watching the daily lives of the locals and the exercising fashion alot of knee braces which appeared to be for fashion. Good place to eat and relax but not on the normal tourist trail. Not a must see but relaxing.
,,Peaceful,5.0,,I spent great time alone when I was sent to Singapore by the company to work. I got relax in this area.
,,loved it,5.0,,East coast park is a lovely place to be if you have children or even as a couple. Nice place to spend the whole day at the beach. One can rent cycles for a reasonable fare and have fun biking! There are several places to have a small picnic or even a barbecue! we enjoyed a lot!
,,Place to unwind from the busy routine,5.0,,"Great place filled with activities (Dining, cycling, sea sports, short walk, etc). Look out for the regular sports event to avoid the crowd in the parks over the weekends."
,,Could do so much with this part of town,3.0,,"East Coast park just ok. Great if you want to rent out bikes, rollerblades etc but nil else to do. Busy busy on a sunday. Could be better if developed a bit more."
,,Best Chilli Crabs and Pepper Crabs in Asia - Never leave Singapore without digging into some crabs,5.0,,We do not exercise but pig out at one of the restaurants at East Coast. The crabs are probably the best I have had in my entire life. Chilli Crabs and Pepper Crabs with the chinese fried buns are an awesome combination... Obviously you wash it down with the local Tsing Tao Beer. Prefer being indoors with the heat outside.
,,Fun on Sundays,4.0,,"Want to know where Singaporeans go on their day off? ECP for sure! So many fun things to see and do. Roller blading, biking, jogging, windsurfing, sailing, water skiing.... endless. It was fun to see the locals enjoy their day off as so many of them work so much. From Hawker's food courts, to seafood restaurants, to MacDonalds, food is abundant and cheap. Great way to get out of the city and enjoy some local flavor."
,,Great place for leisure/BBQ/Cycling,5.0,,"I mostly come to east coast park to cycle. It's quite fun when you go with friends or family and spent several hours there with them. The recent time when i went there, there were offer of additional 2hours for the purchase of 2hours bike rental. There's even a rick-shaw like bike for rent too. Most activities like bbq or flying of kite or even camping could be carried out there.

You do not want to miss this awesome bedok jetty that i've took under my photo section below. The view was definitely awesome and memorable."
,,clean beach,5.0,,"East Coast Park is beach is clean with fresh water in top and deep, that is not polluted and there are many outdoor activities found like bost, yard etc. There are various types of eateries, ranging from see food serving the ever popular soto to restaurants Scruffy's. good place for family"
,,Beware rental bike condition,4.0,,"East Coast Park is great for a leisurely cycle - just ensure the rental bike is in good condition. I ""lost"" my niece and nephew as I got a faulty one and couldn't keep up so it was rather worrying at it was late evening. What's worse is that when I gave feedback to the operator, Coastline Leisure (located near the Lagoon Village food centre), the man in charge said that they sometimes don't have time to check the bikes in between rentals!"
,,A living park,4.0,,"Singapore's East Coast Park is a bustling place. IS it great? Perhaps almost. If a park that has such poor public access is still inundated with joggers, cyclists, skateboards, sand castle builders, campers, walkers and so on, the answer is yes. I visit it at least twice a week as it stretches nearly 15 kilometers along the beach providing cycling and walking trails, most well shaded, usually sea breeze blessed and with any number of rest areas, toilets, bike rental places, restaurants: you name it.
It stretches from Fort Road right up to the SAFRA golf clubs at Tanah Merah and links to several PCNs providing side trips to other reasonably delightful walks and attractions: Siglap Linear Park, Kembangan Canal, Bedok Reservoir, Haig Road pathway and so on. Once you reach the eastern end, you can continue to Tanah Merah Ferry which is almost 19 kilometres from the start before Fort Road. That is a lot of park!
The beaches are created, not natural. Indeed the whole park is on reclaimed land. The sight of hundreds of ships anchored well off shore is a little disquieting. One has visions of spillages etc. Maybe that is why so few swim there.
If only the authorities could do two things the park would be perfect:
1) provide more pubic transport (bus 401 visits on Sundays and public holidays only)
2) enforce the separation of cyclists and walkers. There are signs urging people to be considerate and stick to the right path. Do the cyclists care? No, as any where else, a cyclist has the right of way: didn’t you know that?
That is really annoying. Mind you, lots of walkers use the cycle paths, so…
The place is packed on weekends and evenings. And the campsite son weekends are amazing, packed with Singaporeans enjoying tent life. It is a shame that few of them have enough social graces to dispose of their amazing amount of rubbish thoughtfully. But I suppose it does not matter. After all, the foreign workers will clean up the mess before sunrise.
Despite this, the place is wonderful. As with everything else, it is the few who spoil it."
,,One of the best place in Singapore to go for Picnic,4.0,,"East Coast Park or commonly know was ECP for the locals, is the best place in Singapore where you can go for picnic near the beach. You get to enjoy the beach, do bbq, and could even over night there with a tent. Also also facilities for skating, bicycle, water sports and some amazing foods. If you are in a group, perhaps overnighting at ECP is gonna be really fun while you are in Singapore"
,,Take a cycle or walk along here,4.0,,"I spend a lot of time on the East Coast when in Singapore. It's where a lot of people come to get outdoors and get a bit active in Singapore. Rent a bicycle, skates or just walk the entire coast (which is actually the South Coast of Singapore but you head in an east/west direction along the path).

Shame that the water is horribly dirty from the ships at anchor a few hundred metres off shore. You can often see the oil on the surface from these ships."
,,SOME FRESH AIR AND A LONG WALK,3.0,,"A Long Coastal path set among trees with some spaces for a tent - (tent fees apply)
View across the ocean but is sprawled with Oil Tankers and Merchant ships.
Bring your own water/picnic although there are facilities to buy food and drink here.
If you come by bus can take from Paya Lebar train station/bus stop.
Can hire bikes or roller skates and also water ski hire for tourist/amateurs availabble situated on a small practice lake with cables. .
Swimming not really recommended due to the pollution and tide."
,,Lots to do or just relax,5.0,,"A must do when the weather is good and you feel like doing something active or relaxing, the East Coast can accomodate all. A great place for bike riding with kids, you can hire the bikes which are not too expensive or you can bring your own. Lots of choice to stop and have lunch, the food centre has many highly reccomended place, or you can opt for the chilli crab, our favourite one is still at Jumbo's. A great place to also take those visiting guests."
,,Love it,5.0,,Singapore is for shoppers and I hate to shop. I am staying on the east coast and have found this park to be a wonderful place to spend the day. It is kept very clean. I have rented a bicycle and rode up and down the coast a few times and will do it again later today. There are so many things to see and the people watching is fantastic.
,,Clean free beach to relax,4.0,,"if you want to relax, has some exercise, take a bike along the park, or just sit and enjoy the beach, east cost beach is the best choice, A free and clean beach, where anyone can enjoy anytime. We spend two hours here to take some photograph and enjoy the view, its very relaxing. Just walk 15 minutes from the hostel we stayed, closed to the airport."
,,The place to go after you have had enough of the city,5.0,,"We have been to this park twice on our holiday . Each time we hired bicycles and rode the length and back , feels like about 10 miles end to end. There are some good stops for a quick snack or ice cream . We found it amazingly quiet during week days and enjoyed having a little beach to ourselves for a picnic .
You can see hundreds of container ships in the bay and aircraft comming in to land , all in all a good place for 1/2 a day ."
,,A great place for family to visit,5.0,,"With bike and roller-skate rentals and paths, it is an ideal place to do sports with views of the beach. There are restaurants to stop at and places to camp or stay in small villas."
,,Great place to cycle. Check the weather forecast!,4.0,,"As a resident of Singapore, I recommend this parkway to travellers as a place to spend about half a day (morning/afternoon or afternoon/evening) having a leisurely cycle.

Note that it's not an impressive beach like Australia's Bondi and Surfer's but we don't really get that in Singapore. Take this attraction as a glimpse into Singaporean life as you will see many locals participating in different outdoor activities along the stretch of coast.

To get the best out of your visit, you MUST rent a bicycle. There are many rental shops and a bicycle typically costs 8 to 10 singapore dollars an hour, with some offering special buy 1 hour get 1 hour free deals. You can rent single bikes and tandem bikes, kids bikes can also be rented. Pick your bike well! I had a bad experience with a tandem seat that gave me a sore bottom for 2 days!
The rental shops will typically require identification or a deposit for the bike rental so bring your passport or some extra cash to cover this. It's a good idea to grab a bicycle lock from the staff so that you can secure the bikes if you want to stop and grab a bite or use the toilet. You can usually get bicycles with baskets (added charge) but bringing a backpack is better.

Transport to and from the area is a bit inconvenient, but there are bus services from Bedok Interchange, which you can get to via MRT. Taxi is a good option as well if you can afford it.

From here you can spend a good few hours cycling up one way and back along the stretch. There are a couple of big food centres as well as seafood restaurants where you can grab a quick meal or have a seafood feast respectively. The food centres are cheaper and you will get a more local experience when you eat there so I recommend doing that. Amenities like convenience shops and toilets can be found quite regularly along the park.

A final few notes:
1) Make sure you check the weather forecast for the day, as rain will really put a damper on your visit.
2) Don't expect the place to be empty as there will always be people around! That said it is usually quite spacious and the breeze is regular.
3) Bring cash as the card will not get you anywhere with the small shops!

Enjoy!"
,,Good Place to Relax and Spend Evenings,5.0,,"East Coast Park has a few good attractions, especially the hawker center. You can rent bikes, there is a skate park, wakeboarding park, high end restaurants, sandcastle building, turtle pond, and free camping.

The hawker center is our favorite place to go on weekends and holidays. good food at good prices, good beer, and people seem to be having a good time there.

The only bad things I can say about it is the view of Indonesia is obstructed by a ton of anchored ships waiting for the Singapore port. If you saw the ships' lights at night, you would think you are looking at a city across the bay- seriously. It is also underserved by public transportation.

With that said, it is our favorite place on the island thus far. We explore other places, but keep coming back to East Coast Park"
,,great for camping,5.0,,i used to camp here overnight... i spent 2 new years eve celebration here and it was fantastic & unforgettable.. but i heard that they've been doing a major renovation lately. i hope they won't forget to provide more comfort rooms this time...
,,Great for picnics!,5.0,,"If you have the time, keep an entire day for ECP. Take a walk on the beach, bring your tent for camping, use the barbecue pits (available on first come first serve basis), cycle or skate around (also available on hire), be delighted by the wide array of restaurants."
,,Just an ordinary Beach,3.0,,Its clean but nothing special. Reachable by public bus and near to famous sea food hawker.The Beach a bit narrow and not too long.
,,Bicycle was fun,5.0,,"East coast park is a beach attraction where visitors can go picnics, The highlight of our trip was riding bicycles which was fun, there are food outlets water ski area etc"
,,Nice & beautiful beach,4.0,,"some time you can meet our ex President Mr Nathan, walking along in the morning ! cycling along the beach is the best , were i used to do so !"
,,Poor surface,3.0,,"East Coast Park is one of the few places in Singapore to ride your bike safely without being run over by a car. However, the main part of it is extremely crowded. In order to enjoy more peace, one needs to move more towards the east. The asphalt quality varies a lot and can be in very bad shape in some instances. For those who want to skate, there are a few stretches that are more acceptable in terms of quality, but none is great. Access to the park is very limited, so it is best to take a taxi or bring your own car."
,,Very popular spot,4.0,,Ok - It's not Noosa but for lovely bikeways and walkways on the doorstep of a large modern city it offers lots. Very popular on week-ends with families and there are many BBQ and picnic facitlies. The water does not look too bad but not sure I would swim there with all of the container ships anchored off shore.
,,The only beach in Singapore,4.0,,Singapore may be an island but the East Coast stretch is the only decent family recreational beach. You can perform many advanced activities that you can't in the other parts of the country like cycling.
,,having fun,5.0,,you want to know how average singaporeans have fun? Come and enjoy a park with great eateries and many sport activities.
,,The best beach to chill out (any time of the day) in Singapore.,5.0,,"The best beach in Singapore for jogging, cycling, brisk walking, picnic and for children to play by the beach."
,,Good place for outdoor activities,4.0,,"People usually come here for some workouts, running, jogging, or biking. On Sundays there are couple of group exercise, mostly joined by elderly though. Bike rental available, and you can also order tandem bike, or a tuktuk-like one"
,,East Coast Park - Food village,4.0,,"Need I say anymore?? The sun, the sand, the sea and OMG the food!! There is nothing like gulping down a crisp and perfectly chilled tiger beer and chomping on the delicious satay!!"
,,A crowded park,3.0,,The park is very long and close to the beach but it is too crowded and heavily littered.Joggers and cyclists intermingle with each other.There is a lack of quiet and peace in the Park.
,,Just walk walk,4.0,,"Good for families and friends BBQ. Usually packed on weekends with many people BBQ-ing, cycling, blading, strolling around so it's not too quiet. Not the best attraction in Singapore but it's FREE, so if you're in the East area no harm popping by to enjoy a slow walk and night breeze too! I usually stop by for some BBQ chicken wings in the park. Usually quite crowded with the locals so you must be prepared for a little noise level and kids screaming and laughter all around. Many benches available for rest too."
,,Godo place to relax or burn calories,5.0,,"I visited the park two times this week and enjoyed my trip in many ways. I had a long walk along the beach for some time. Sat down on one of the clean benches and stared at the water. Ran for some time and picked up a water bottle from the near by shop. Drank water and relaxed a bit more. At the end, had dinner at a near by restaurant and came back. Even though weekends are crowded, weekdays it is really enjoyable. There are places to camp and BBQ as well. So this park is good for lone rangers and family. There are many good restaurants which gives quality food for all your tastes. Highly recommended to try."
,,"A nice stretch to hang out, or exercise",4.0,,"Unfortunately you don't get big waves here thanks to the ships off shore, but it is a nice place to be in. Cycle around, so you can see Bedok Jetty and the eating places that's scattered along the stretch"
,,Super nice seaside park in the city life,4.0,,"Great jogging, super nice drink in the breeze, just recommended for easy relax as a break from the city life !"
,,Just ok,3.0,,We lived very close to the park and it was one of the reason's that we moved to the East side of Singapore. Park was a huge disappointment. If you want to go for a bike ride you must go very early in the morning or risk running people over. It's very crowded on the weekends and the locals are not used to people using the trails for exercise. It's a slow ride and beginner inline skate track. Restaurants are pretty good and they have a track for remote controlled cars as well as a place to waterski. Sunday's the place is filled with maid's on their day off. Look out over the polluted waters and all of the tankers.
,,Not as good as before,2.0,,"So packed, so many people around, feel so cheap, great diff from other country's beaches, really a shame"
,,Always good,5.0,,"Great place to ride a bike or go for a walk, there's always something interesting to see. A great place to hang out in the weekend."
,,East Coast Park,4.0,,"Sun, sand & the sea...blading, cycling, dining near the hawker centre and eateries Great place to catch the rising sun and the evening breeze .... and the are near the water-breaks provides a nice spot to be near the nature"
,,Biking East Coast,3.0,,One of the more popular things to do here is to ride bikes. More interesting for me is riding bikes at Pulau Ubin.
,,great weekend outing,4.0,,"It's a great place to escape the city for a walk, bikeride or rollerblade. There are several shops renting bikes and such to choose from. Lovely to go for a long jog or bikeride and then stop for lunch at one of the restaurants. We went to Brussel Sprouts and had some excellent fish and chips near the water."
,,"Relaxing, fun but beware of crowds",4.0,,"Try the park connectors : rent a bike and follow the PCN pathways, explore the unknown, venture out of ECP itself. This might bring you pleasant surprises. Check out the lesser known parks like Changi Beach and Pasir Ris Park. Avoid the crowds which can be quite repelling during the weekends."
,,Great place to take the family.,4.0,,This is a great place to get out and enjoy the sunshine. Very nice walking and bike paths. We rented paddle boards and paddled around all afternoon. One thing to know is that as far as we could tell most restaurants on the beach don't open until 3pm.
,,Great place for a lazy and relaxing Sunday afternoon,5.0,,"I was at the East Coast Park the previous weekend for the Yoga By The Sea 2012 event. What can I say but a lovely place to spend a lazy and relaxing Sunday afternoon by the beach. Bring a picnic basket and chill out while enjoying the breeze and sights of ships anchored off the coast and rolling on the lawn and sand. Don't worry if you don't have a picnic basket, there are some good eateries and a hawker centre along the park. BBQs are popular as well since there are publicly available BBQ pits around.

This is also an excellent place for running, cycling, roller blading and also water sports such as kite surfing, wind surfing, yachting, etc. As for running, now I know why my Singaporean running friends love to train there!! :)"
,,A great palce to go for a walk,5.0,,East coast park is one of my favorite place to go in Singapore you walk along the beach with a great view of the Sips anchored off Singapore. Pleanty of place to eat and drink along the way. You can alos rent bikes rollar blades as well. Go for a walk and head to Jumbo's as we normally do the best Chilli crab in Singapore!
,,Gathering place with friends and family...,3.0,,"you can cycling, picnic, flying kite with your friends and love one....is a good place to enjoy with all your friend and you can BBQ there as well in the weekend time. If you like a happening weekend and have some outdoor activity, else please away from it.... there is a hot burn sun...."
,,Leisure with Locals,4.0,,"I was in Singapore for 3 weeks on an exchange program and friends brought me to this less-touristed venue. A hidden gem all locals know about and a great place to spend a day. I like the cycling under mature trees right be the sea. Even though the beach is not much, the shoreline is attractive. There are many ships at sea and the occasional airplane coming in to land flying low was quite a novelty. Best of all, you see Singaporean in all shapes and colors jogging, picnicing, cycling, skating, strolling, and even fishing by the beach. There are food places along the way. More tourists should visit!"
,,Nice for a Sunday morning with the family,4.0,,"This is a great place to take the kids on a Sunday morning. Rent bikes and the place which is right there, have a tootle around on the paths, then grab lunch at the hawker centre. Fabulous, perfect. You get nice breezes and you get to take in one of Singapore's iconic sights - hundreds of container ships just off the beach in the Singapore Straits - well, it is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world!"
,,Lots to do. Beach is average,3.0,,"You can hire bikes, or go skating here. Lots of simple food stalls and Starbucks are to be found. Good place to go for a day at the weekend."
,,Beach and skating rink,3.0,,I love to roller blade by the sea. The sea is in front of you. You can see the expanse of the sea with its calm and almost rippling flat water.
,,The Place for Enjoyable Walk,4.0,,"This place is almost always crowded! filled with people jogging,cycling,BBQ-ing,walking,sitting,fishing,relaxing,eating,drinking, and many other! I love cycling around the beach which you can rent for only 6 dollar for the 1st hour and 4 dollar for the next hour. The beach was very clean and well preserved. So much enjoyable moment here, no wonder singaporean people really like to come over to this place, especially weekends.
Final Word : this place is worthy to be visit at any nice day for relaxing when you're at Singapore"
,,A place where locals flocks to for a little of nature...,3.0,,"For a jog or walk, this is a local hangouts, stroll, or just spending time at the beach...excellent for a leisurely time with kids and family"
,,Something for everyone..,5.0,,"ECP covers a large area and there is something for everyone - Camping, BBQ, Cycling, running, skating, walking, swimming, dining, sailing, playing sports, sitting on a bench and watch people, watch the ships go by, fishing, watch the planes land and take off.. just so many things you could do there.."
,,we love the sun & beach,4.0,,"we went to east coast park on a public holiday. we parked at car park E2 - be warned - parking charges still applies on public holiday for this car park. at this portion of the beach, we were near the bicyle kiosk, food centre and toilets. we reached there about 8am and the weather was fantastic. there are 2 pavilioins available on a first-come-first serve basis and there is a bbq pit also. we went with friends and we brought food. bought drinks at the food centre though. some of us cycled, some just laze around. other younger children played in the sand. we left around 12 noon when it become quite hot. a very pleasant and relaxing way to spend a public holiday."
,,Great for picnics and outdoor enthusiasts,4.0,,"Lots of people having picnics/bbq. mostly families on weekends. if you love cycling, rollerblading, this is the place for you."
,,Nice getaway,3.0,,"Went here with my family (6 adults, and 2 kids ages 6 and 3). All had fun.
We didn't swin at the beach, because it was dirty. But we had fun playing in the sand, cycling, and the kids had fun riding the small rides.
There's also food hawkers not far, and all the food was delicious, esp the sting ray and sate."
,,Chance to people watch,4.0,,"Stretching for 10.5km, the ECP is a great place to spend an hour or a day. Walkers, cyclists ... all share the park, enabling people to get out of their homes and into the fresh air. Take a picnic or hire a BBQ pit and sit and watch the world go by or simply try and count the number of ships in the straits."
,,Good place to cycle,3.0,,"Nice place to cycle and do some exercise specially on a sunny day, it is a small get away from busy life in Singapore. Also many people experience the Night Cycling there."
,,my camping site,4.0,,"I used to camp here at least twice a month. I've been very stressed at work and nothing beats the sound of the waves to cool my nerves. Waking up witnessing the sun rises is such a gift too!

You can do many things here like roller blading, biking, sun bathing, kite flying, BBq-ing etc."
,,Great place to relax over good food,4.0,,"Great place to unwind, cycle along the east coast, and after enjoy some seafood, beer at the numerous cafes and restaurants along the paths."
,,Nice for people watching but the beach sucks,3.0,,"ECP is great on weekends with loads of people cycling, skating, walking, camping and having a good time. Safe and a good atmosphere but the 200 or so container ships ruin the view, and its not entirely for sophisticated discerning clientele."
,,Bike riding @ East Coast Park,5.0,,rent a bike (starting 6 SGD) and cycle along the coastline. Beautiful scenery. View of Marina bay.
,,Cycling @ East Coast Park of Singapore,4.0,,"Two friends and I took our bicycles from HK and visited Singapore in early July 2012. We did not have much expectation as we were told that Singapore was not quite bike-friendly but it turns out to be wrong. We lived in the Lavender area which is not far away from the East Coast Park. The condition of the road leading to the Park is good, actually much better than in HK (where the roads are full of holes, bumps and drain covers). The Park is full of trees, big ones and nicely maintained grassland. The Park is along the coast and hence nice sea views are in abundant. There are a lot of kiosks, restaurents, toilets as well as shower areas! The trail for cyling is wide and is separated from that for jogging. We cycled to the far end at the junction of the Aviation Park Road and then returned, what a nice ride!Singapore's East Park is superior to HK's Pak Shek Kok Promenade and Tolo Harbour Cycling Trail where the trail is narrow and with a lot obstacles (!! at intersections with pediatrians, which are risky to non-experienced cyclists). If one wants to pick a bone from an egg, maybe the only undesirable feature is that the East Coast Park is too flat and hence not challenging enough for those who like climbing slopes."
,,Barbeque in ECP,5.0,,"you wanna organise a nice bbq party, go to ECP. get a bbq pit on hire and you can book it online as well through national parks of singapore website. I booked the bbq pit online, bought all the bbq stuff from NTUC fairprice and they even helped deliver the stuff to my bbq pit location. Choose the pit near the beach but not too far away from the toilet and the carpark. It really helps. No body wants to walk long distance to pee when you are having a fun bbq party. Enjoy your bbq time."
,,Cycling is fun.,4.0,,"I have been to East Coast for cycling with my husband for at least 2 times in the last 1.5 years. The rental rates are rather cheap, at $6 for an hour and $7 for two hours. The whole cycling track is very long, and will take about 2 hours. There are a lot of places for renting the bikes, and there are different types of bikes, single bikes, one you can put a passenger at the back, and one you can put a child at the back etc. The only disadvantage is that the people who are roller-bladding are also sharing the cycling tracks with the cyclist, which I find quite dangerous (as some times they unexpectedly fall, and the cyclist have to react quickly.)"
,,Activities at East Coast Park in Singapore,4.0,,"Nice place. Rent bicycle, it's a huge park, cycling around is fun! Jogging or walking, got nice walking path. BBQ, it looks fun. You can also do sailing, wind surfing, kite surfing. Not enough wind most the time, though :-(. But interested doing wakeboading at ski360? It's good, doesnt depend on wind. It's fun."
,,Jumbo chili crab!,4.0,,"Must try - Jumbo chili crab, Man-Tou, crispy baby squid, donut with seafood paste......mmmm!!"
,,"Great scenery, getting sunburn",3.0,,You can came here by bus but a lil bit confusing for tourist cause u must took a MRT first and then bus...open area and it's easy to getting sunburn..many couples sit there and many people come here by bicycle too..nice place to visit if you had much time
,,Cycling along East Coast,4.0,,"My family and I renedt bikes at East Coast Park as there is a great cycle track along the eastern coast of SIngapore. This leads all the way up to Changi Village. It's a long ride given the humidity of Singapore, however it's really nice to be cycling along the coast and looking out to sea. At one point it turns north along the airport and you can actually watch the planes landing and taking off.
I recommend taking a lot of water with you as you can easily get dehydrated as you sweat a lot.

We didn't cycle all the way to Change Village (where there are plenty of restaurants and hawker stalls). Instead we turned back and headed to the hawker stalls on East Coast near the sailing centre. We were famished so it was great to tuck into some local food like mee goreng and char kway teow. Very cheap too!

This was a great family outing and a great way to get some exercise, as well as see some of the beaches of Singapore."
,,Don't want to spend?,3.0,,"It's free over here, but don't set your expectations too high. The beach cannot be compared to neighbouring countries'"
,,Hire a bike or skates,3.0,,"The best way to get full benefit from this park is to hire a bike or skates or to go for a stroll in the evening when it is cool & you can see the lights of the ships and city. I love the park on public holidays because it is full of people having picnics, BBQs and camping."
,,Always love this place!,5.0,,Cycling until changi airport! It was so much fun! Loved the scenic view and the windy feel from the trees and also the beach view.
,,Fabulous way to enjoy nature,5.0,,"I'd been meaning to visit Singapore.s East Coast Park for the 30 years that I've been coming here, and finally made it! The park runs adjacent to the drive from Changi Airport to the city, and always looks lush and inviting. Plus, I heard that it housed the best black pepper crab in Singapore - a favorite dish if my husband's.
We caught a taxi from our hotel, asking to be dropped off where you can hire bikes. We hired a mountain bike each for $10 for 2 hours. The brakes and gears were a little worse for wear but there were very few needs for either. The park has well maintained bike/blade path and a separate path for walkers. We rode about 30 kilometers in that 2 hours, including a stop for lunch at the East Coast Seafood Centre, a large hawker market within the park. Perhaps only a third of the stalls were open for lunch but we both found something tasty to eat - including a black pepper crab ($30) which was delicious.
There are gardens and beaches and play areas for children along the park, as well as being a ship and plane spotter's paradise, being so close to Changi's runways.
We thoroughly enjoyed the experience and I'd recommend it to anyone, even just for dinner and a stroll. We had no trouble catching a taxi out again, as so many people arrive that way."
,,Healthy Lifestyle by the beach,4.0,,"Skate, jog, cycle or briskwalk by the beach. Plenty of food outlets for you to fill your tummy."
,,great park!,5.0,,great place to spend a saturday / sunday with ur frens or family with lotsa activities u can choose fr cycling/bbq/camping/skating.........
,,wonderful place to relax,5.0,,a great place for people to relax and work out. you can cycle and jogging as and when u like. does not need to work about food as there are shop and a market over there. wonderful food^^
,,Good for a weekend out,4.0,,East Coast Park is my favourite place to go cycling as it offers reasonable bike rentals and long trails to bike on.
,,Nice place but...,4.0,,"It is a super nice place but such a pity that the food area is under construction. Else, you will all have a fun time eating at Mac Donald's or drink at Coffeebean or Eat Turkish food or Eat indian food or Eat buffet and many more. Do find out when the construction will be over. Otherwise, just enjoy the beach. Nice place to be at in the morning and evening."
,,Should be part of any tourist's itinerary,5.0,,"We spent a Saturday evening in the East Coast Park and were amazed and the life there: people camping, barbequeing, clycle, roller skating and even water skiing.

Singaporeans certainly know how to have a good time. I wish we had a place like this back in Reading !"
,,Ahhh - this is Singapore!,4.0,,"Fun time riding bikes. One sometimes forgets that Singapore is an island and a small one at that - East Coast Park is an enjoyable way to remember. Too many campers and people staking out large sections of the park with mounds of stuff (boxes of food, etc.) - takes away from the beauty."
,,Good chill-out zone,3.0,,More relaxed and chilled out than you'd expect for Singapore. A handful if decent restaurants and stuff for kids to do. Can certainly let them run and get their energy out.
,,Have fun,4.0,,It's a happening place for the locals. Good opportunity to see how locals relax and spend their weekend. Bike rental is inexpensive and is the best way to travel the length of the park.
,,A nice walk by the beach,5.0,,"This is the calm & quiet area overlooking the long beach of Singapore. East coast road and the areas around it, mostly being residential, draw less cround into the east coast park (compared to other Singapore attractions) which makes it a good spot to walk, relax and have a chat."
,,"Nice ocean breeze, great seafood restaurants",4.0,,Good fun place for some great seafood and pleasant ocean breezes. Popular with families. Come earlier for dinner to get good seats.
,,Safe Cycling in the park,4.0,,"Long, beautiful, green and relaxing park. Can do lots of activities or just get a bench under a coconut tree and read. Can not swim in this area. Water too dirty, beach not so great but the park is wonderful."
,,Breathe in clean and green,5.0,,"Escape the hustle and bustle to ECP. Lots of greenery close to the sea. You can stroll, you can bike, you can sit, or you can take a bite. Lots of clean green and airy space. Lots of eating places. Lots of people at their leisurely paces."
,,"Tired, crowded family staple",3.0,,"The beaches are slowly eroding, the cyclists are just as ruthless as ever and certain parts of the park have now become tent city. Still, good for an evening stroll and finish with long queues and so-so food at the food centre."
,,Interesting yet relaxing and peaceful,5.0,,Head down to Singapore favorite beach and you will be rewarded with a fun filled day. Rent a bicycle or blades and coast down down the beach enjoying the cool sea breeze while treating your senses to the relaxing and rejuvenating surroundings. Peddle your way to the Bedok Jetty and observe the crowd there fishing away the marine life (Stingray is a common catch there) I would usually end off the evening with some seafood at the seafood centre or some bbq food at one of the cafes there.
,,Get some exercise and see ships waiting to dock,5.0,,"You can walk for kilometres along beside the sea. There are literally hundreds of ships moored off the shore, waiting to dock in Singapore. At night the lights are stunning. It is even possible to camp in the park. One of the best Hawkers Markets is there as well."
,,Nothing much! Waste of Time,2.0,,"Nothing much to see, complete waste of time. We rented bickes and ride for a while and head to the city. Boring place"
,,Best place to bike,5.0,,"I spend weekends biking at this park, reaching Changi Airport (and back)! Then eat satay or barbecued chicken at their hawker center."
,,For the completely artificial experience,2.0,,"This is one beach which is artificial, artificial, artificial. Completely man-made, over-crowded... suffering erosion of the shoreline..."
,,One of the few places in Singapore to catch some sea breeze,3.0,,"Not much of a beach, more like a park with some eateries scattered here and there."
,,A Place to loose your weight,4.0,,Just came in from the visit and walk at theECP. Staying with my friends at Meyer Road Condo...It is was a long walk..but a surprise was there for us..We had a bike ride ( 3 + 3 )
,,Just average,3.0,,"My main concern here is the accessibility. Your only option if you don't have your own vehicle is taxi. While heading there might not be a problem but getting out of there to hail a cab from the road or taxi stand will take time especially at nite. So if you found yourself in such situation, don't waste time just go ahead and start dialling the numbers of taxi companies. You will increase your chances to get out of there rather than taking the risk that there might just be a vacant taxi that will pass by.

It's a good alternative though, for ambiance dining of your seafood cravings. Check-out the restaurants at the East Coast Seafood Centre. Overall, the park needs a good renovation. When you take a walk, it feels though you're strolling on a place zapped in the 70s-80s era. Vintage is cool so long as properly maintained, public toilets are horrible. You will need to hold it up until you find your usual McDonalds or BK for their restrooms."
,,A dream beach,5.0,,A beautiful walk path and barbecue area on a beach of dream.
,,Even Walks are great,4.0,,"If your looking for a place away form all the city life, this is a great place to get away an go for a long long walk...."
,,Great walking/running tracks,4.0,,"Well organised tracks, separating bikes, skateboards from runners and walkers. Bit dark at night with inadequate lighting even though it is very safe in Singapore, you might trip!"
,,Have a break from city life,4.0,,"East Coast offers everyone a good time, old or young, sporty or not. Enjoy the walks, drives, cafes and outdoor facilities. Especially on the weekend it is bikers paradise!"
,,Not a real beach,2.0,,"This is a beach for fishing, not swimming. It may be nice if you intend on just bike riding or taking a walk but I would not hang out there. There are tons of families taking up all the seating areas- they just camp out and sit there all day! Lots of litter too."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"It's my favourite place to hang out with friends, especially in the evening during the sunset."
,,Nice to go for a walk,5.0,,Took my dog for a walk down here and stopped at a pub called Scruffy Murphys along the way. Very relaxing afternoon
,,Best Afternoon In Singapore,5.0,,"OK...if your in Singapore..get your Nike's on and get a little exercise. Take a cab to East Coast Park, get out in front of McDonalds, and head for the beach..about 100 meters. you'll pass thru a bunch of shops and come out on the paved bike and walking paths that go in either direction for many kilometers along the coast. I always marvel at the sheer number of ships anchored just offshore. Rent yourself a bicycle and ride. Many areas you can stop for something to drink or eat, but my favorite is to time my visit there so I catch the sunset up at the east coast seafood center and grab a seat at Long Beach Seafood, right out next to the walking path, eat some great Chili or Pepper crab, and a cold beer and watch the sun go down and watch offshore become another lit up city of ships...You simply cannot beat it for a afternoon & evening in Singapore."
,,Loads to do!,4.0,,"East Coast park is very versatile, it's like a good park, a beach and a number of attractions rolled into one! You can eat nice food, go prawn fishing, learn cycling proficiency, play mini golf and many other activities, as well as cycling, walking roller blading in comfort without fear of people getting in your way! The BBQ pits at the beach are available to rent for a small fee and are well equipped and clean for public BBQ pits, they allow you to say at the beach until midnight. The park gets busy for camping with a lot of couples on a Saturday night though."
,,Great green space - kind of hard to get to,4.0,,"This is a wonderful park in Singapore where you can get a glimpse of average folk enjoying their spare time. My only concern is that it's not really near a subway station, and access is somewhat difficult since you need to cross a busy highway using underpasses that are only sporadically placed."
,,Breath Taking Nature & Beach,5.0,,"When in Singapore and crave for a beach with an amazing nature, this is a must visit!"
,,Skating and then seafood,4.0,,"Hire skates and go up and down the park. Takes you about 1,5 hours. Have some drinks at one of the many bars and at the end, get the seafood at the seafood center"
,,Great place to exercise,5.0,,"This area of Singapore is really nice and away from the crowds. Lots to do..skating cycling water sports and eating. Great seafood at Hawker center and there are plenty of restaurants to fit all budgets. One or 2 places offer live music on the weekend. On weekdays it is quieter than on weekends...but one can still find a quiet spot by the beach. Nice walking paths and separate bike path. And, like most of Singapore it is very safe. A great place for the whole family. I enjoy my walks here!"
,,Good Family place,4.0,,Good hang out for a day with friend and family.... Cycling and roller blades and settle for a good dinner...
,,A crowd pleaser,5.0,,"It is not a romantic place, please. But it has something for everyone, really. Great if you are training from the marathon, just as good if your exercise regime is walking from an ice-cream cone (NZ ice-cream) to a juicy burger (Carls Junior). Away from the main F&B and entertainment stretch, the park is connected to the airport runway which offers a more serene setting. Lovely to hire a bicycle and explore."
,,A must in SIN,4.0,,"You go here for one thing only, the original Black Pepper Crab, and served in the best way at Long Beach Restaurant. Reserve a table outside!"
,,Refreshing green in the city rush,4.0,,"A pleasant place to escape the heat and rush of Singapore, although it can still be hot if there is not much wind blowing. Walk, jog, cycle, roller blade, the choice is yours. There is a beach, but not to sure about the water quality. There are numerous places to eat or just rest and get a hot and cold drink. Best time is early morning before the sun gets too hot, or in the evening."
,,perfect place for an evening stroll,3.0,,"Have seafood here and take a long walk after meal along the coast. It's nice and relaxing, but don't bother getting close or into the water. It does not look very clean and the sand is kind of rough too. Walking, running, roller skating, scootering are all great here."
,,Just Great !,5.0,,"The east coast park just like its name has the Singapore beach on one side and lush green grass and trees with a running and cycling track on the other.. We dropped at the starbucks cafe area and took some twin-cycles on hire, the ride was awesome and we went up to the dyke on the beach and laid our hands on some fishing rods of locals. The experience was so naturally full-filling !!"
,,Congested BIG-time!,1.0,,"East Coast Park is badly congested with jogggers, cyclists, skaters, etc.You don't feel at ease when you are here. Coming to a beach should be a very relaxing experience but it is NOT. And the colour of the sea water is unpleasant; it is a murky brown colour. To be exact, it is brackish. It cannot match with NZ's Coromandel or Waiheke ISland. What a shame,"
,,"Dirty, Noisy, Infested",2.0,,"Not exactly litters everywhere,I thought the cleaners did a fantastic job of keeping the place as clean as possible. But if you have grown up on the island, you would see how much the sand quality has changed through the years, from bad to worse. Although the management has tried its very best to vibrant up the area with new food outlets and chase away the trouble making businesses, it never fail to irk me when I'm there with the noise and inconsiderate beach-goers all around. I believe there is a problem beneath the problem,but here I'd only class it under the venue because there is no cursor to be pointed to the people. No need to visit. Oh. There is a Thai Disco on top of the McDonald's restaurant tho'."
,,A breathing place in town,4.0,,"You can try the cable park their and the nice food court, just to hang out and enjoy the sun during the weekend. Rent a bike for 4 dollars and ride along the sea.
Only bad point, vessels waiting for the access to the Singapore Port, but it's the same everywhere in Singapore."
,,perfect place for the whole day outdoors,5.0,,"To my mind, this place is better for swimming and beaching than Sentosa. A lot of space, less seaweed in water, cheaper food nearby.
Every 500 meters there is a bike-rental station (don't miss the opportunity 'cause convenient separate bike path is 10 km long - you can ride and ride)"
,,Large park with nice sandy beach,4.0,,Singaporeans usually don't go for the beach - but it's nice to do it anyway and the water is warm and clean
,,Nice to be part of the local life,4.0,,We spent an afternoon lying on the sands of East Coast Park and felt like locals. Good choice if you wanna experience the casual moments of typical Singaporeans. Chilli crabs at Seafood Center were unforgettable. Do take your passport with you and they might request your identification when you like to rent a bike.
,,Great park,4.0,,"I like East Coast Park lots. I cycle often through the park - day or night. The tracks are excellent - busy during weekends - vegetation tropical and fine sea views. Bedok jetty good place to get into the sea for a view of the park. Many eateries all scattered several places, the Park Food Center is great at night. Outside the Foodcenter entrance icecream is sold: blocs of icecream wrapped as a sandwich between white bread, taste surprisingly good. Bike rental available. A green oasis in the middle of it all - thats East Coast Park to me and a place with lots of fun things going on."
,,East Coast Park,5.0,,What can I say this is a really great area of town to be in. Its got everything you could wish for including walks to the beach and nearby shopping malls/food stores/eating places any amount. Get a No 36 bus straight to Orchard for around S$2 - remember have plenty change as busses dont give change!!!!
,,Nice park,4.0,,"This park is nice. Very quiet, wooded slightly. Lots of little places to eat, seafood restaurants, beaches, fishing holes, etc. Bike and walking path along the shoreline."
,,Fun free and crowded on the weekends,4.0,,"East coast park is fun and free! You can rent bikes and roller blades, have a beer on the beach @ Scruffy Murphy's or a glass of wine @ Manamana. Beware if it super crowded on weekends don't even bother on a holiday."
,,Nice away from all the hustle and bustle,4.0,,"Have a paddle, have something to eat, hire a bike or roller blades, have a look around the very small market, kids have a ride on a few fair rides.
There are lots of areas of East Coast Park but the on I describe is the main area where the MacDonalds is, you can go to other areas and it is very quiet with not a lot to do except the beach (which is not all that clean unfortunately and surprisingly for Singapore) and have a picnic.. Another area is where the 360 degree water ski is which is good fun if you like some adventure."
,,okay park,3.0,,"well its an okay park, but watch out for children on rented bikes and skates - they have no clue where they are going!"
,,nice beach,4.0,,"At Singapore night life in east coast park and beach is very good and many entertainment on this side, take taxi near by pub untill 1.00am very good night life also, Mc'D also have in the beach side cycling and roller skates also for rental there. nice view of the beach, if u have tent use on the beach like own house..."
,,Wonderful Area.,5.0,,"I really like this area better then Sentosa. Sentosa is actually full of attractions, but this is a real beach and here you can get relaxed, swim, flying kite is another experience here for me. Yes i did cycling *while renting it from there and move till Changi air port too."
,,See how the locals relax........,4.0,,"East Coast Park is a long, thin park next to the beach. With views out to sea (& out to the tankers!) this is a picturesque place to unwind. Hire a BBQ or a bike, go rollerskating, a walk, run etc you can even camp over night or go windsurfing on the lake.

A great day out and very busy at weekends."
,,Over Crowded,2.0,,"The reason why it's always crowded on week nights and week ends is that it's the only strip of open space in the East Coast. So go if your main aim is to exercise. Don't if you want to get some of your own space.
===================

,,Loverley Location,4.0,,But not as clean as the rest of Singapore rubbish left every where tissues bottle tops cigarrete ends you name it was there. Beach is excellent and there is avery good seafood centre whic includes an excellet Italian Restaurant
,,A bloody long walk!!!!,3.0,,"The tourist maps in Singapore leave a lot out about the distance between things and obviously the Lonely Planet missed a few critical factors out of it's last Encounter edition. The eating areas at the Northern end of the park are pretty much closed, the park is being redeveloped and all have been asked to close by March this year. The Hawker centre which we walked almost 5K's for wasn't even open! Would recommend getting a taxi if you do want to visit, the only attraction really is seeing all the boast! Far better off with a beach bed on Sentosa just outside the bar Coastes on Silosa beach I reckon"
,,Favorite local beach/park,5.0,,"My favorite part of the city. A very local crowd mainly living in the eastern part of the city. On weekends, it gets increasingly more busy. On long weekends/public holidays, you get to see many families setting up camps to enjoy the beach."
,,Best park in Singapore,5.0,,"One of the few areas of Singapore with a fresh breeze from the sea. Get a view of one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. Good for running, cycling, skating because of its length. Most running events, including the Standard Chartered and Sundown marathons, take place at least in part along this park.

There are a number of seafood centres, as well as a hawker centre which is somewhat unique in Singapore due to its seaside position. It mostly attracts local residents rather than foreign tourists so prices will be better than some of the more central food centres."
,,Best Pepper Crab,5.0,,Long Beach restaurant for best chill and pepper crab but a little expensive
,,Fun-filled,4.0,,"East Coast Park is one of the beach that is not polluted and there are many outdoor activities found like cycling,etc. There are various types of eateries, ranging from hawker food serving the ever popular satays to restaurants like Scruffy's. A place for everyone to enjoy!!"
,,Great Day Out in Singapore,5.0,,"The huge park stretching from the CBD to Changi Airport is one of this increasingly crowded city's gems (although it too can be packed on weekend afternoons). If you have a day to spare and want to just be outside, rent a bike and venture along the well-marked paths and admire the views toward Indonesia along the busy shipping lane (no swimming unfortunately). You can go all the way past the airport to Changi Village, have a local lunch there and slowly bike back and have a sundowner and snacks at the East Coast Lagoon Hawker Centre, all for a fraction of what you would lay out for one of the rather generic artificial attractions on Sentosa Island. The exercise and (fairly) fresh air will make you feel good as well. You will actually meet some real Singaporeans, including pensioners from the adjacent public housing blocks getting some exercise, affluent yuppies pretending they can rollerblade and windsurf, maids pushing their youthful wards in elaborate strollers and migrant labourers chilling out during lunch break...a great cross-section of Singapore society."
,,"A beach, but only so-so",3.0,,"Can't say more -- waters are too exposed and used too much by the ships and tankers docked ahead, not really an ideal beach location..."
,,Great food,4.0,,We had a nice meal at a restaurant where you can select the seafood you want out of tanks on the premises. Found it hard to get a taxi back to our hotel.
,,eat and stroll,5.0,,This is the perfect place to eat and take a stroll. Restaurants here are fantastic (my favourite is Long Beach) and after a big dinner you can enjoy a relaxing walk on the seaside and also after midnight you can go everywhere because Singapore is very very very safe.
,,Its more beautful when sun sets ................,5.0,,"Had a great time at east coast park with other couples . the view was amazing with the setting sun and docked ships not far away from the beach ... i would suggest to book a barbeque deck which they have on the beach , which can be done online for 16 dollars .

There are many nice joints which play nice misic ,if not interested in barbeque .Rent a bike n enjoy the park ...must do"
,,It'd be nice if people picked their rubbish up after them,3.0,,"Bins bins everywhere and yet half the people who use this park don't seem to know what they're for. I walk down there quite often for exercise and especially after the weekend, the guys who look after it are busy bagging up piles of rubbish that has been chucked around by the people.

There are things to do down at the park - restaurants at Marine Cove and the old Big Splash and further up at the Seafood Centre, Lagoon Hawker and one up at the Bouganvillia Garden. Bike rental, swimming if you like being surrounded by old flipflops, plastic bags and junk (the sea isn't particularly clean) - beware the sea is rough too - land reclamation means that you're swimming in what should be deep sea, the beach shelves fairly steeply and people do drown out here (no lifeguards). Probably best to only paddle unless you're training for a triathlon or something."
,,Sunday out,3.0,,"Rent a bike or rollerblades and get on the trail following the coast line. Watch people enjoying food and family and friends. Get wet at ski cable park - wakeboarding, water skiing, kneeboarding."
,,Great food at affordable prices,5.0,,A extravaganza of local seafood restuarants. Most are outside overlooking the Ocean. My 2 favourites are 'Jumbo' and 'No Signboard' restuarants. You must have the pepper and chili crab.
,,Good hawker centre,4.0,,"Although its a park with adjoining beach, locals and the expat community visit the park for its great hawker food located in the middle of the parkway."
,,"A stretch of sea, sand and fun",4.0,,"The East Coast Park is one of Singapore's earliest planned recreation hub, dating all the way back to the 70's. Before that, it was a normal barren coastline. The govt took over the planning and developed the place to what it is today, a recreation hub by the sea, where you can rent a bicycle, a pair of roller blades or a canoe. If not, you can laze by the beach and watch the world go by. The water is not as clear as compared to beaches in Thailand or Malaysia, but its clean nonetheless. At the end of the day, you can choose various dining options, from fast food to high end."
,,Excellent place for a day or evening of fun!!!,4.0,,"Try a day of walking, biking, roller blading, cable skiing, or just sitting watching the water... Then feast at the Hawker centre or try one of the great restaurants at East Coast park. It easy to get to and a nice relief away from shopping and the city."
,,A beach is it?,3.0,,"Well do not go there expecting a big natural beach. It is long all right, but I still dont call it a real beach because if you lie down your feet will be in the water and your head will be in the grass, not on the sand (Ok thats a bit of an exaggeration) It is an artificially seeded beach and I am not sure I would swim there.

However one can sit by the sea, unwind while one watches the ships on the horizon, and planes that are headed to or away from Changi airport! They have used the length of the place to a great advantage and built nice tracks to cycle and skate. If you are there try the kangaroo boots, its quiet fun :)

Its lines with several lovely restaurants serving cuisines from several parts of the world, so one can enjoying a lovely meal there and watch not the sunset but the Moonrise. It looks quiet mesmerizing on a full moon night."
,,Good place for a stroll and a bit of sea breeze,3.0,,"The East Coast Park is a long stretch of land on the east cost of the island.
Is a good place for a stroll or to enjoy a bit of fresh air coming from the sea.
In the park there are several seafood restaurant normally packed during weekends."
,,A park for a stroll,3.0,,"The beach area has resided, the water in the sea was not clear , little brownish, guess to many ships ply the seas around the island. Lots of eateries located along the beach area which would be a plus point. Seafood restaurants, a huge local food center serving many Singaporean delights. Would return for the food and a stroll again."
,,Fun for the whole family (or friends),4.0,,Great place to have picnics and just hang out with the family on a weekend.
,,The non-shopping bit of singapore,5.0,,"If you are the type of person who hates shopping and you stuck in singapore, this is a nice little oasis.

If you can handle a little bit of tropical heat, this is a great place to chill out and enjoy the serenity. You can hire a bike from one of the local shops in the east coast park, and the singapore national parks folks have built a series of fantastic cycle ways that go along the entire coastline for about 15km to changi village where there a number of good local food stalls and old colonial buildings/ museums. East coast park is also great for shorter walks or bike rides with coconut palms, calm seas and some jungle type forests. Also plenty of food options for lunch or dinner."
,,A fun day,5.0,,"The East Coast Park is a fun day. You can rent bikes and ride for many kilometers. There are many restaurants to choose from to have an enjoyable lunch or dinner.
You can also enjoy the beach and water if you bring your swim gear. You can get there by car (a lot of parking is available but you must have the punch out parking cards to pay for the parking), take a bus or taxi or bike there from the city if you are ambitious."
,,Great day out,5.0,,"Walking on the beach, renting a bike, sitting by the pub .. and dogs are welcome most places! Lovely way to spend a day"
,,cycle or skate,4.0,,"the rite time to go there is before sunset. and view sunset from there. get a bicycle. its nt worth skating there. and better get the cycle with narrow tires. the white sand is awesome if ur there with ur partner. spend nite there... people also use tents to stay there and there are spots for BBQ. families usually come there to party.

important is to brignthe food along for this trip. there is a wave park also. but aint worth it. v artificial.

the restaurants are v expansive there. not much choice also.

dont miss the futsal grounds there. if u hav a team juz enter there. u will enjoy it in evenings.

and also the drag racing of remote controlled cars. really pro guys come there. u wont even wanna do it yourself. only watching is so fun"
,,GREAT PLACE!!!,5.0,,"I am a Singaporean, live in Singapore, therefore likes to go to east coast park with my father and brother during the weekends to get some exercise. I basically love this place. Hope this was helpful!"
,,"Good ambience, sporty, chill place to hang out over the weekend",4.0,,"Do your own BBQ, bring your tents and camp out under the stars. See all the ships headed to the harbor and fantastic seafood close by makes ECP a perfect weekend gateway for me and my gf :-)"
,,A good day out,5.0,,"Grab a hire bike, or roller blades and make use of the lovely paths. You can walk or jog. Plenty of shops and caves and spots to sit around on the beach. Don't expect clean swimming waters!"
,,Good park for locals.,4.0,,"For the locals, this is park with one beach to swim, cycle, skating, roller-blading, romance, camping, barbecue, family gathering and others.

Things are getting more and more expensive there even some businesses have not been working out well like recently we visited there last week. A Japanese restaurant which serves SGD$1 per oyster with good food etc have closed down. So sad..

The sea water there is yellowish but you can still swim (no problem with that) but most people may not want to do it nowadays when they visit the park. There are public toilets around the park so bathing and changing are not so much of a problem.

There is a Goldkist Resort there which is very expensive, old and not worth to stay at all. Last time when it was under the old management, it was affordable for even the locals. Camping is more recommended for people who loves to get nearer to the sea.

Camping is free but you need to obtain a permit for NParks."
,,great wake board park :),4.0,,"My hubby has been wake boarding at this park for a while now and it is great, staff are really good and cannot fault it! Only thing is that the places for food & drink can be a little expensive but a lot of Singapore is like that, but a good place to have fun :)"
,,Great place to visit if you have time,5.0,,This place is 20 minutes or so out of central Singapore city by bus. It is 185 hectares of coastal park and it has kilometres of shaded walking and bike tracks. Once there you can hire bikes and walk to your hearts content. There are great walking tracks. Weekends are extremely busy with people everywhere doing the family thing. BBQs are popular. Good place the relax and watch the locals at play away from the hustle of the city.
,,"Relaxing, recreation place",5.0,,"Very nice park, stretched along the East coast of Singapore. Perfect place for renting a bike and ride it along the coast, do a picnic or simply sit and relax. Good place to go with family."
,,Excellent place to spend time with friends and family,5.0,,"I've been there many times while living in Singapore, and it is probably the best park in Singapore. You may have a BBQ there, or you can rent a bike and cycle around, or just have a picnic on a coast. There are some playgrounds for kids as well so nobody will be bored."
,,Delicious Crabs,5.0,,Most delicious crabs found at the East Coast Park. I wish I could have gone for a bicycle ride.
,,"Hello, black pepper crab!",5.0,,"Been to SG several times, but I never knew this place existed before! I always got stuck roaming around the city centre and the shopping areas, but when I asked a friend if we could have a crab dinner, he brought me to this centre (I thought SG was all about their famous hawker centres only), and it was superb! Shout out to the Long Beach Restaurant."
,,Full of life..,5.0,,"One of the best places to visit in Singapore..a awesomely long stretch of a beach..get dropped near McDonalds and you can start from there!
Rent a cycle in one of the many shops around the area (take something close to McD - since many shops insist on returning the bikes in the same shop - ours even took our passports as a deposit!)
10 mins from here is a water skiing place..they also have a knee boarding option for beginners..
For the pros, there is a wind surfing club about 5-6 kms from here...they got some beginners courses too - but you need to register in advance.
Barbecue places, good amount of food outlets, smaller shops selling beachwear and other knickknacks and miles and miles of the sea! Have fun!"
,,OK for walking but water not so clean,4.0,,"Can rent a bicycle or roller skates etc here

On a hot day here can get exhausting as there is quite a long walk by the coast so I advse oyu to take water/liquid.

The view can see, so many, many tankers and ships out at the sea.
There are a couple fo restaurants here and Komar's is vegetarian Indian."
,,"very good park for walkers , joggers , cyclists, fitmess enthusiasts and for just hangout",4.0,,"very good place for fitness enthusiasts, jogging , cycling , walking , skating . 10.5 km long track for all . Nice restaurents for veg and non veg including indian.
lots of parkng areas .Very good coastal view, park is connected with many Park Connnectors from various loacations along the length and greenery maintained well ."
,,Nice park next to the sea,4.0,,"This is a nice large park next to the sea. It is clean, well maintained and has sufficient public facilities to make one's visit a comfortable one. Surprisingly for a public park, this is a very quiet one

there are barbequie grill points too, where one can bring their own grills.

Cabs from this place are not easy to get by. So please do plan for it."
,,Great for Seafood!!,5.0,,"There are quite a few seafood restaurants to choose from here, but we ate at Jumbos which was excellent! We had a lovely outside table on the waterfront, and thoroughly enjoyed the singapore black pepper crab - YUM! A really lovely dining experience!"
,,Tasty as usually,5.0,,Sea food great as usual. A plenty of sea fruits which I never even have seen before. Black pepper crab - mark A+ Chily crab - mark A+ and so on and so force.
,,"Cheap food, local atmosphere",4.0,,"If you have to do Chilli or Pepper Crab, do it at Jumbos or one of the others. Much cheaper than Clarke or Boat Quay and few tourists, mostly expats and Locals."
,,Great day out in the park,5.0,,"We visited this park twice. You can reach there either by taxi or by driving there. I chose to drive and park for free in car park C1. It should be close to a Mcdonalds. Once parked, we went to a nearby cycle rental shop to hire the bikes. It was around 10 SGD for 2 hours for each bike. The cycling path was really long and you could spend 2 hours to cycle from Zone B to F, whilst passing through some ice cream shops or seafood restaurants. Although the sea view was great (loads of container ships), the environment was very pleasant. Going on weekdays meant there were hardly any other people there. I think its quite crowded weekends."
,,"Not crystal blue but nice long stretch of beaches for picnics, cycling, seasports n chiiling out",4.0,,"The beaches are not crystal blue. But the long beaches make a nice outing anytime. Weekends are crowded with families on picnics, with some putting up tents to stay overnite. Many ppl rent bike to cycle around the sprawling beaches. Joggers can also be seen, usually in the evenings. And inline skaters a plenty too. There are also many seasports activities for a fee. And food eateries, local hawker fares, fast food, seafood to the more upmarket restaurants. Though the locations of these may not be near to each other. A good inexpensive place to chill out by the sea."
,,Cable ski park - ski 360 - adrenalin action sports,4.0,,"very happy to find this place. We hired bicycles for a ride along the beachfront and found it by accident. Its a great way to entertain your kids or youself in Singapore, get wet, get some excercise and learn a new watersport. Provide some balance to the hectic pace.

Its got a great restaurant & bar venue so you can sit at a shaded table, have a drink, have some snacks, and video the antics of your group as they try to master the sport. All boards are provided, but the kneeboards were in short supply as many were out of service - damaged. ( note to managers - please stay on top of that problem) Stand-up boards are available as beginners boards with foot straps, and wakeboards with bindings. Water is replenished from the ocean as it is right next to the beach.
The venue could benefit from extra or better located exit-steps on the far side of the lagoon as my son had some long swims. Most beginners fall off at the turns so the exits should be logically close to those spots. Some exits were un-useable due to the amount of floating scum & gunge.

We were there in April and it was pleasantly cooler at this spot as the breezes were strong and cool off the bay. Getting to and from is a challenge, as its hard to explain to taxi drivers. But basically if you get on the East Coast Park Service road it is the City side of the Bedok South Ave 1 flyover on East Coast Parkway. Perhaps someone else can define it better..?? any comments??

This venue, combined with the WaveHouse Flowrider surfing venue at Siloso Beach Sentosa Island really contributed to a great holiday our family had recently in Singapore. Who would have expected an action sports holiday in Singapore ??? Sensational.!!"
,,The most popular park in Singapore,4.0,,"East Coast Park is free beach on Singapore’s southeastern coast and the most popular park in Singapore. I've been there for several times.

The park is easily accessible by East Coast Park Service Road with numerous exits along the East Coast Parkway. The park is accessible via public transport in the form of bus services, available on East Coast Park Service Road. However usually I went there by taxi from Tanah Merah MRT.

The park has barbecue pits, entertainment facilities, chalets, food and beverage, and amenities for sports activities. A cycling and inline skating track runs along the perimeter of the park. Wakeboarding can be a challenge. Last time when my friends tried playing wakeboarding due to lack of experience, just they went in to the water, they had already fall down to the water.

Because it is a free park, if you come at Singapore public holiday, there are so many people come. But do not worry if you feel hungry, they are so many restaurant and fast food near the beach. So visiting East Coast Park is a cheapest way to enjoy the beach and have fun with your family or friends in Singapore."
