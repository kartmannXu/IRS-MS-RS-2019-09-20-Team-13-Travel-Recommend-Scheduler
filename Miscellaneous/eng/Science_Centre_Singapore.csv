,,Pricey for what it has,3.0,,"We were four ( 2 adults +2 kids 5& 7 yes old). Paid SGD 48 for 7 days pass ( you can come & visit the science centre till the last 7th date). It had Science+Butterfly+omni theatre+Dino quest+Laser Maze. With our ticket you can repeat only science. It's pricey for the given contents. Actually we believed that the science should have been free especially for kids and students. I mean having seen gardens by bay and marina bay for free this ought have been as it is educational.

If you try to read & understand the whole thing in the science it'll be tiresome. If some were illustrated either through voice or computerized it would be entertaining and understandable more.

The omni theatre is great but the film we saw was the origin of life so it was beyond the scope of the understanding of my kids, but was cool though.

The butterfly was great but if you already went to the Singapore Zoo, it's by far small area and will not meet your expectations.

The rest are v.good I.e dino quest & laser maze.

If you plan to go there with kids do plan to carry their swimming outfits. There is a mini water park for kids. They'll enjoy it."
,,Plenty to do and see,4.0,,Science center filled with experiments that kids and dads can try together. Very fun. We spend a happy couple hours in there.
,,Take note of the occasional cheap afternoon,4.0,,"Do take note of the occasional cheap afternoon, otherwise this is really expensive. It is really quite aged, and does not give enough focus or attention to the big issues of our time, but is still fun with all those dusty and dated ""science"" projects.

The highlight is the mirror-maze, but seriously, can one of the minions get in there and wipe the nasty fingerprints off the mirrors. It would be many times better if those were clean.

I thoroughly enjoyed watching the eggs hatching. Such a simple and cheap pleasure. Others seemed to feel the same way.

I also learnt that Razer (gaming company) comes from Singapore, as does the usb-flashdrive, although that seems to be contentious, as per wiki. Israeli and Chinese companies also lay claims to the patent.

THE PLOT THICKENS."
,,It’s alright,3.0,,I wanted to go to the dinosaur exhibition but there was too Long a queue so just opt for their standard one instead. It’s not too big. Some exhibits fancinates but many others were not working.
,,Great place for kids,4.0,,"Although the site is a little aged, there is a lot of content that will keeps the kids occupied for hours. Content good till early secondary school or early teens. Lots of interactive exhibits. Water playground seems fun! Annual membership is good if you plan to go more than 2 times, which is quite doable. Live events every few hours are pretty cool even if you see it 2x in the year."
,,Very interactive...,5.0,,"Our little one (4 years old) had an absolute ball at the Centre. It focus is on providing interactive play for the children, and the big children!

Of note was the Tesla talk and show and the 8k movie! Those in its self is worth the visit.

We spent 4 hours there and all but had to drag our little one out kicking and crying! Yes crying!!

Tip 1: take your children’s swimmers, the water area is a good way to end the day!

Tip 2: if you have been to the butterfly enclosure at the airport it probably worth giving this exhibit a miss...it was not inspiring at all.

Really easy to get there and only a 10 min walk from the train station."
,,Not very impressive.,3.0,,"We arrived at the centre by bus number 335. We took MRT to Jurong East, walked toward the bus interchange. We could take either 335 or 66. Alighted at the 4th bus stop (including the interchange’s as first).

It was a shame that the Laser Maze was under maintenance. We paid for $33 per pax for entry to 5 stations, also included Dino Quest to see the new exhibits (excluding Snow City). We were told to return within 7 days for the Maze, if not, they could give us some souvenirs from the Info Counter. We didn’t plan to return so we collected some pin-badges.

My kids enjoyed the Mirror Maze & the Science of Fear very much. They visited them repeatedly. They also loved the Up Close with Butterflies. They loved to feel the ever-fluttering butterflies above their heads. There was a holder with butterfly information leaflets depicting the species that you could spot in this Station. Very informative. Thank God, a station guard was there to prevent kids from shouting & tourists from pinning the wings of butterflies at their feeding areas. This Station could become crowded, yet I personally liked the most.

Another of my favourite was watching the documentary show at the Omni-theatre. Please note that there are certain time slots and you adhere to it. Be there 10 mins earlier. We sat on the highest level, loved the show about Earth - snow, polar bears, big brown bears, human inhabitants living side by side with them. Pretty exciting & moving in fact. The sound system & lighting were pretty good.

Some foreign students in groups were a little pushy when we spent a little more time maneuvering the exhibits at the electrical & voltage station. Demo of the voltage speed & power wasn’t fantastic, though the lady commentator was very jovial & eloquent.

The fire tornado demo was good, but it was so hot around the cylinder where fire was ragingly spinning within it. We couldn’t bear the heat, we went to scout for the Dino Quest.

The Dino Quest Station had the longest wait & queue of all. The queue snaked all the way to the exterior of the entrance, it was rather warm, so all of us were sweaty! When we got into the exhibit hall, we didn’t find it impressive. Our kids didn’t want to participate in the drawing activities. Those seemed to attract younger children more. There were some interactive games that required us to scan our badges against the screen if we got our answers correct. The hall was very small. We expected more could be felt with our hands. The skeletal system of the Dino’s (T-Rex) was of good size.

McDonalds near the ticketing counter was small & crowded with lunch time crowd. No seats were available. We went further in & ate at Coffee Bee, average food quality & service. Self-service.

We left the centre around 5.30pm. An announcement informing that the centre would be closed at 6pm could be heard over the PA system. The souvenirs weren’t impressive too.

We had a tiring day. Would not consider returning till some spots were properly maintained (they were getting old, very worn out & some were spoilt)."
,,It’s just ok,3.0,,"If you are a well traveled person and have seen various science centers this one is actually a very basic science center given that it’s in Singapore. I m sure they could have done a much better job. It’s not very interactive. It’s good for kids ages 4-10 or 12 maybe. The only good part that I enjoyed was the butterfly arena. They let the butterflies fly around and it’s pretty cool, snow city I found was pretty pricy as you have to buy ticket as well as the rental outfits. For us coming from Canada it was not worth it :)"
,,"Undergoing a much-needed refurbishment in places, but a great place to visit",4.0,,"So, the run down bits are pretty poor but these seem to already be under refurbishment. The parts that have already been modernised are really great. We spent hours and hours in this place and had the best day with our son. So much to see and learn about. A quest for the kids and they win a prize for completion. Interesting exhibits.

The food places really need to be improved though - the standard is not acceptable."
,,Nothing much changed since last visit,2.0,,"I visited Science Centre when I was a boy. I was a happy kid, being able to see and interact with the exhibits hence I have a very vivd memory about it. 20 years later I revisited Science Centre but unfortunately it looks rundown. The main entranced seems dull and the atmosphere of the starting trial was extremely quite. A few simulator isn't working at the same time. But nevertheless still a good place to spend your weekends if you do not mind travelling almost 1 hour from the city by train followed by 5 minutes walking."
,,Can be better,4.0,,"Came here for the Dino Quest exhibit. Price wise bit tad expensive, but the exhibit is educational enough for my child. The place can keep him occupied for 2 hour with the activities available.

One thing is they could have open additional counter on a weekend rather than having 2 during their peak hour"
,,Dino Quest exhibition is very disappointing,1.0,,"Thee Dino Quest exhibition was held from 1 June to 31 Aug 2019. The o ly reason we visited is because my young kiddos are big fans of dinosaurs.

The exhibition was held at the annexe building of Science Centre (note that its not inside the main hall). The entrance is the registration where every person was issued a themed landyard and a RFID card that is used for some interactive elements in various parts of the exhibition. Note that both items need to be returned and are not given as souvenirs.

The exhibition is divided I to about 7 zones, 2 of which are videos. The exhibits are unfortunately not display of dinosaur fossils or skeletons but just some posters, a few models that can move, some videos amd only very limited dinosaur related items. I only took less than an hour to complete my tour.

Tickets are priced at $18/adult and $15/child and seriously its a ripoff. This is not the first time I visited the Science Centre for such special exhibits and everytime I am disappointed with the experience I derived. This time even my kids (6 and 4 years old) complained that it's boring and lousy."
,,Must visit place for both kids and adults,5.0,,This had to be on your must visit place in Singapore.. The kids very surely like it. Very interactive and informative.. Please also each the movie in the Omni theatre.. The ticket for the movie is expensive but worth it.. Please do visit.. Highly recommended..
,,Great for family day out,4.0,,Purchase entrance tickets online to enjoy the discounted price offered. The place was great fun for both children and adults. We learnt and experienced a lot while having a fun time at this place. Its worth the time and money spent.
,,Singapore Science Centre,3.0,,"Overall, the center is informative and fun for children and adults.
However, I was dismayed on the butterfly 'park' as the the entrance fee itself was SGD8 for both kids and adults but it was so small and humid."
,,Fun & science,5.0,,"Excellent place to visit with family,especially kids,they enjoyed a lot,veey informative,....we all like the omni theatre show,and its sitting arrangements.."
,,Fun!,5.0,,"When we visited the Science Museum, we went to several different exhibits, like the volcano and human body. We heard a baby crying at the volcano as the noise the ""explosion"" made was quite loud. The human body was fun, letting the kids slide down a slide and walk through the intestines. When they came out, the human body let out a fart, like they were poop! We went to the earthquake exhibit, which let the kids, who had never experienced an earthquake in their life, learn how it felt like. There was also a wind simulator which showed us how fast the wind was going per km/h . We watched a man perform a show with dry ice and learnt about dry ice. And the best part is that everything is free! Overall one of the best places in Singapore to go, keep up the good work and service!"
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,Great place to visit especially with children. The maze is interesting and we went quite some time there. Marine Alcove fun too. We went to the Omni theatre for the film Rainforest Bear. Very good film with the 3D effects. Overall a fun place to spend a whole day there
,,A Hidden Gem,5.0,,"Visited the science center with my teenage daughter and my preteen son. It was not originally on my to visit list but It was one of the best places to visit. We took the combo ticket with Omni theatre, butterfly dome and science center. The omni theatre had a documentary on the great rainforest bears. The 40 min documentary had us all enthralled with beautiful visuals and the heart warming tale of the spirit bear ( white in colour). We learnt so much of these lovely creatures and their cousins and the efforts of the native Americans to help save these beautiful beings.
The Science center in itself was a great learning experience for all age groups. So many activities and working models. The mirror maze is a must do. The cloud shaper is another excellent exhibit. The kinetic park outside the center has some amazing working models and a small fountain where the young ones can jump around.The activity area can keep the little ones occupied for hours. The staff was extremely polite and helpful. Last but not the least,the butterfly dome was a great way to see butterflies. We saw the crysalis, puppa and adults butterflies. They were sitting on our backpacks. It was so much fun to be up close and personal with them.Lastly, the McDonald's outside the center has an amazing variety of food for young ones.
A must visit for everyone."
,,Plenty of hands-on activities for kids,4.0,,"Visited kidstop and snow city at science centre. My 6 and 3 year old kids enjoys the activities offered at kidstop. Expect groups of young school kids visiting the centre if you decide to come during weekdays.

There is a cafe just outside Kidstop. Not much foods apart from some puffs and cakes. There is a Chinese restaurant in the centre itself. However, son and daughter still prefer to have McDonald’s which is located at the far end of the centre. The walk from Kidstop to McDonald’s was shades and stroller friendly.

Kids enjoyed the snow city too! Don’t expect too much from it. My kids, having never experienced snow before, enjoyed them. Slipping and falling on their bums were something they both could not stop laughing about. It’s more of an ice city than now - just like a big freezer. There is 1hr time limit to play in ice city. There are photographers available in the play area - photos need to be bought off them upon checking out.

There is only 1 waiting area at snow city -where my wife and 10months old kid had to wait us. Not the most convenient place to wait - cafeteria setup.

Overall, good place to spend times with your kids. Spent a good 3hours at this place. Kids had fun and that’s most important to me."
,,Ok if you have kids,3.0,,Ok to visit if you have school going kids. A few exhibits are good but not worth visiting all the way just to see this from City.
,,Kids time,5.0,,"Many interactive attraction to try. Kids will be energised by many areas of science 🧪, practicing different experiments 🧫. There is playground to rest outside as well. If hungry 😋 the fast food is nearby"
,,No age limits if you’re a science enthusiast,5.0,,Creative stuff to wander around without any age limit. All sorts of tourist visit science museum. Can capture many astounding pics if you’re good at photography.
,,A great way to absorb science information,4.0,,On our recent visit we thought we had booked for the Art Science Museum but instead it was the Science Centre. It is out of Singapore - we drove in the taxi for 20 minutes. It is well set out and spacious. There were several school groups visiting and it was a joy to watch the children play and learn. We also enjoyed the butterfly exhibit and the Omni theatre experience. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit.
,,Why you should visit the Singapore science centre,5.0,,"For spring break I went to the Singapore science centre. It was amazing there was so many things to see and do.
Here are my new top three reasons why I believe everyone should visit the Singapore science centre.
Firstly, it is worth every dollar because it is really cool!
Secondly, the shows are awesome and very interesting.
Finally, it is very good for children and you can learn a lot from the shows.
To sum up I think Singapore science centre is truly a wonderful place."
,,Great for children!!,5.0,,"The Singapore Science Centre is a must go (for children )It is quite expensive but I think that it is worth every dollar.The three o'clock fire tornado is very entertaining !! There were also hatching chicks!!It will keep the children entertained for a long time.At five,there was an indoor lightning show!You can experience lots of interesting things that you cannot see in real life! I really recommend this centre to everyone that comes to Singapore.!!!"
,,"Strongly recommended for everyone, especially kids and teenagers !!!",5.0,,"Science centre in Singapore is a must visit destination for all, especially if you have kids. The place has a lot of exhibits which one can see, feel, interact and understand how various principles of science actually work !!! Its a pandora's box for an inquisitive mind. My 12 year old son just loved the place and we spent more than 4-5 hours here. The place is quite big and they also have a omni theatre show and butterfly info centre inside. Science centre of Singapore has won quite a few accolades and international awards over the years. Admission fee is not very high and would strongly recommend the place to all tourist !!!!"
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Singapore Science Center is a must visit because it gives you a sneak peek about the carious technological advancements the country has witnessed an implemented.

You would be amazed by the sheer display of various aspects which would make you to want going there, over & over again."
,,Good,4.0,,Very good experience for small and young children to study science esp below 14. Elder with interest in science would also enjoy
,,Very outdated,2.0,,"Visited this place after probably more than 10 years. Surprised to see that one of their main attraction is still the tesla coil lol

Most exhibits are just boards whereby you read nonstop or from small ancient looking tv screens

Very few interactive exhibits. A couple were not working as well.

Take note that the place seems to be undergoing major reconstruction though especially on the second floor.

A small portion of the science centre is also off limits unless you are part of a predetermined group :/

Only spent an hour there at this place."
,,Outdated and needs a makeover,2.0,,"My two children (9 and 16) visited the Science Centre whilst on a short break. We previously lived in Singapore about 10 years ago so were keen to see how it had changed and compare it to our local Scitech in Perth. As its quite far from the ""city"" and public buses required walking in the humidity and heat, we took a cab there and back which was costly (~$25 each way). Sadly a lot of the exhibits were unchanged from a decade ago. They were tired and old looking. The only highlight was the butterfly garden and wind fire tunnel. There was a small cafe selling snacks and local fare. We didn't revisit snow city so cannot say whether that has been upgraded. We spent less than 2 hours there. Can only recommend for younger children."
,,Nice,4.0,,"Its a very gud museum cun centre having various exhibits. But the butterfly park and the dome show is very sad and just not worth spending for extra tickets. Butterfly park has very few variety and the dome features animated movies that belongs to an age old era technology, the black and white days type but styled in colour. Not at all worth"
,,Learning More About How The World Works,5.0,,"We went to the Science Center as a family, with two adult and three children, two teenagers and one child.

The Center inside is spacious and welcoming,with lots of exciting and informative exhibits right from the starwt of your journey. There were plentiful exhibits concerning illusions and how our minds perceives them,as well as an exciting simulation that actually lets you experience the force of a earthquake without being in a real one. There was one simulating a tornado too, and we could feel the wind blasting through our hair and faces above impressive speeds of 100km/hr.

There were also sections dedicated to the Earth , as well as Sounds, interactive games to play, Becoming A Scientist for a Day and much more. We also got to experience VR, as if we riding on a roller coaster through different environments, which was a new experience.

We particularly enjoyed the Fear exhibit and the one about how our brains work. Both were very interesting and informative, especially the Fear one which was engaging and certainly an experience not to forget too soon!

In this review I would also like to thank the customer service, particularly Mr Alfred who was very patient and helpful throughout the entire experience. We had unexpectedly lost something in one of the exhibits and was frantic. We were sure it had gone forever, reporting it as lost to customer service. Not only did Mr Alfred followed up with us about the lost item, but also genuinely took the time and liberty to help mail it back to us which was a surprise! (We live in Malaysia, next to Singapore.) Thank you Mr Alfred, your kindness will not be forgotten :) we are immensely grateful and appreciative of your help.

Overall, the experience was fun, engaging and interactive! A must for a family activity, especially with kids who are eager to learn more about the world they live in."
,,Science fun,4.0,,"We spent about four hours at the Science Centre as a family with children 13yrs, 12yrs and 9 yrs. There were some fantastic presentations including a Tesla coil and fire tornado. So many exhibits to see that we stopped for lunch and then continued with more exhibits. There were outdoor water play/exhibits if you bring swimmers. Very interesting and great family fun."
,,"A great experience, done well",5.0,,"Very engaging exhibits in a number of themed galleries that both kids and adults enjoyed. The demonstrations of the Tesla Coil and the Fire Tornado were great, too. Helpful staff. Spent most of the day here and very glad we did."
,,My science centre experience.,4.0,,"The science centre is actually quite interesting, whether you love science or not its a place for you to see and learn something and have fun with your friends and family or go solo like me. I been here before since kindergarden days and it brings alot of memomries to me till now that I can still remember. The best attractions to me were the snow city which is super doper cold( Wear a hat to protect your ears*) and the science centre itself there. Its cheap to go in."
,,Great interactive & educative museum,4.0,,"Great museum for kids, teenagers but also adults, they learn here a lot about nature, physics, history, human body, medicine, etc. Many exhibits are interactive, there are also regular shows and other activities. However, as this centre was opened quite some time ago, some exhibitions could be renewed.
With kids plan at least one full day."
,,Interesting Place,4.0,,"Spent the full day at the Science center from open till closed with 2 boys age 5 and 7. Many interesting hands on experience for them to try. They loved the tornado machine and the science of fear and also the maze. For the 7 years he went twice to the science of fear. But my 5 y.o
found that it was to scary. He did cried a bit and closed his eyes for some of the exhibition inside. We went for the butterfiles up close also and Omni Theatre for the space movie. The movie was a bit long and not an interest for my kids. But they were sitting nicely the whole time though :) . For the food, we saw Mcdonalds and chinese food. I forgot the names."
,,New OK Old very old,2.0,,We left Singapore 4 years ago and thought during this visit we should check out the Science Centre again. The new exhibits were good but the old exhibits looked old 8 years ago and not much has changed. Also during our several visits when we lived here there was always broken exhibits and unused areas. This hasn’t changed and makes it seem sad. So they are lucky to get 2 stars and I wouldn’t rush to come back again.
,,Great place for Kids,5.0,,"One place that you do not want your kid to miss at Singapore. Loved most of the exhibits (the Ancient Greek exhibit was fantastic), and shows. The Space Next 3D movie is a miss. Takes about 3-4 hours. Ideal for kids between 10-12."
,,Dated attraction and many exhibits under 'repair',2.0,,Came to the Science centre a few times with kids. Many themes are display each time. Alot of the stations have very out dated design and overall feel not interactive and fun. Alot of the stations are under 'maintenance'. Very annoying if things are not fixed yet charge us an entrance fee. A pale comparison to the ones we visited in Japan.
,,Fun,4.0,,"It was an interactive visit. My family and i enjoyed it. There was a maze of glass,science shows, etc. Its good for families with young kids."
,,Wonderful building and exhibits,5.0,,We visited in October on a fairly wet day and we weren't disappointed. The building itself is an architectural attraction and the exhibits were very good. At the time they were largely digitally based and were excellent. The exhibits appealed to all ages and there were a lot of children enjoying them. The exhibits change regularly. We found the entrance fee reasonable.
,,A rip-off for Butterflies Up Close - Do Not Waste Your Money,1.0,,"Previously, my sons and i love to visit this exhibit, and we must have visited it no fewer than 5 times, despite the admission price of $9 (for members). At this particular visit, we are now told repeatedly that we are no longer allowed to touch the butterflies. My sons and I are extremely disappointed and enraged about this. If we knew we would definitely not have come. I questioned the value of this, to which the guide said, it's to observe the butterflies feed, etc without harming them. What an absolute rip-off. I would advise against visiting this. Strongly."
,,Top Rainy day attraction,4.0,,"It was raining heavily on one of the 3 days we were there and the science centre came up as a top attraction on rainy days. Although it was a bit of an MRT ride out of the central area, it was well worth the little trek. The centre was big and filled with interesting interactive exhibits which kept me and my partner entertained for 2-3 hours. There isn’t much around there aimed for tourists but would recommend!"
,,Butterflies up close,1.0,,"My son and I love to visit Butterflies up close in Science Center because we were given the opportunity to learn about them and the guides will teach us how to hold the butterflies gently.
But on Diwali day, we were left disappointed when the 2 guides kept repeatedly told us not to touch them even though we knew we were allowed to based on our past several visits. As a result, my son was very disappointed and we left less than spending 30mins there.
I would like to enquire is there a change in the training on your guides to tell your guests not to hold or touch them. If so, I don't think it is worth to pay $10 admission to see these beautiful butterflies because it is not considered 'up close' anymore.
My son grew to love them and even remembers all their species names. We also breed our own common lime butterflies at home. So please, let your guests have a chance to get up close with the butterflies and instead of 'stalking' us thinking we will hurt them. We left because we felt unwelcome."
,,Butterfly Upclose,4.0,,We visited the Butterfly Upclose within the Science Center premise and were surprised to be so closed to the butterflies. Learn a lot and had a very interactive time there with the butterflies.
,,Very Educative,5.0,,One must visit there Signature Butterfly park . Its unique . One can watch evolution of butterfly life cycle live. They have lot of educational content.
,,"Ok, but dated",3.0,,"I came here in 2003. It was revolutionary at the time. 15 yrs later, I'd have hoped things had moved on. Not really.

Good for a leisurely afternoon, but not so when surrounded by 200 children from local schools. We did not get a chance to go near anything, nor could we spend time reading any of the blurbs because we were being pushed aside and the noise was intense from all the shouting and yelling.

Go on a weekend or public holiday. An easy ride on the train and a short walk from the JE MRT.

Or, if you are in Melbourne, go to Scienceworks."
,,Excellent half-day activity.,4.0,,"We took the Science Centre and Snow City package for the sake of letting our kids frost themselves and go down the icy slope on tubes.

The Science Centre was great to spark curiosity. We enjoyed the section on Illusions, Scientist for a Day experiments, the Mr. Crackitt’s labyrinth, the laser maze (2-persons at a time, pay extra), the Earth exhibits among the many activities the centre had on offer."
,,Enjoyable Experience at Science Centre!,4.0,,"After many years of not visiting, My friends and I decided to make a trip down to the Science Centre to explore the new exhibitions they have also going back to Science Centre have reminded me of my childhood memories there!

My friend and I went to attend the tour under the exhibition named Dialogue with time-Embrace Ageing given by the staffs there. Since our tour is about ageing, our tour guide is actually from pioneers generation that is experiencing the stages ageing which I find it relatable because it is rare to have pioneers giving a tour since they are now experiencing the ageing process. Throughout the whole tour, my friends and I enjoyed ourselves very much and we are grateful to go on a tour conducted by the pioneers generation.

During the tour, we get to experience the ageing process through the hands-on activities & interactive panels such as walking up the staircase with an two 4kg or 2kg weight tied on your leg, opening a door with the shaking effects, hearing problems when answering a phone call etc so as to experience the struggle that the pioneers faced in their daily life and there is an audio area where we can listen to the stories of the pioneers of how they faced ageing process. In all, it is really a good educational and fun tour which I would recommend people to go for when they are visiting the Science Centre!!

Not only that, I love the intangibility services that they provided to us! Their friendliness and enthusiasm really make the tour a wonderful memory for us as they conduct the tour through the bottom of their hearts, telling us interesting facts and sharing of knowledge. Not only that, when we are enjoying the activities there, the tour guides are very helpful as they help us if we needed help such as helping us to tie the 4kg or 2kg weight as we do not know tie and adjust it, how to execute the activity there etc. Also, they go the extra mile by sharing their own personal experiences!

I would like thanks the all staffs and tour guides for letting us have a great time over there!"
,,Fun place,5.0,,"I had been visiting this place many times for the pass ten years with my kids.
Every time I come with my kids it always give me new a lot of surprises and funs.
A lot of games and new scientific information being desmontrated thru poster and games which is very useful knowledge.
I really love this place and definitely will be back again."
,,Super fun activity for the whole day,5.0,,"I went to Science Center with my kids, a 7 yo and 5 yo. I bought a combo ticket which includes admission to butterfly garden, Invention of Ancient Greece, and Omni Theater.

The science center itself is so big and full of exciting exhibit that we actually haven't really tried all items although we came at 11 am and stayed here until they are closed at 6 pm.

Too bad some exhibits in the E-mmersive Experiential Environment area were closed that day. And I also didn't bring swimming clothes for my kids to play in the water area.

The butterfly garden might be good if you are into butterflies.

The Invention of Ancient Greece is actually kinda so-so if not for the Greek costume booth. You could take a picture using gladiator costume, with helmet, sword and robe.

Before we went home, the kids played in Kinetic Garden outside the Center. It was a day well spent indeed."
,,Star gazing at Science center,5.0,,Went for star gazing on Friday and it was awesome. Saw Saturn and Mars through the telescope. There are a variety of activities during day time. This is definitely worth the visit!
,,Fun,3.0,,Its a nice place but many games inside are under reparations or just closed and no body tell you this in the entrance or when you pay the tiket. So little bit expensive for the condition but the idea is nice and the kids like it
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Wow so many things to do and see here. There's Light Fantastic Mirror Maze, Laser Maze, fascinating butterfly display, science exhibits to tickle your interest. Watch an amazing 3D show at the IMAX Omni theatre. When you want a breath of fresh air, head outdoors to Kinetic Garden. When the heat gets to you, go cool down at Snow City. So much fun in the snow!"
,,Accidental visit but still enjoyed!,3.0,,"When looking at this - I had been advised to go to the Art Science Museum but obviously when I searched, it came up with this Science Centre instead!
Having said that it was still only a 15min taxi ride from Orchard Road and reasonably priced too. You could easily spend a full day there - however we only went in the afternoon and were then keen to eat at the Hawkers!!
Having said that we still got to see the butterflies - Amazing! Our young kids each had one on them and they were just beautiful to see up close and so many of them too!! The lady in the enclosure was lovely as well.
We also saw the fire tornado demonstration which was pretty cool. It was all very educational and whilst we did get to see most of it, it was just a bit rushed!!
There is also a water play area - which we didn’t realise at the time - so remember to take spare clothes or bathers if your kids will want a play in there!!"
,,Perfect for kids 4years and up,5.0,,"Took my 5 year old to the science center. He absolutely loved it. There are people at the front who try to sell you the yearly ticket, i would suggest that see it first and then decide for the annual pass."
,,Nice.. we enjoyed it,4.0,,There is quite a bit to do.. preferable for kids above the ages of 4 or there abouts. My daughter was pretty fascinated by the lights and animals. But shes only 2 and majority of the activities are not suitable for her but older kids would enjoy them.
,,still like the old one and never change. boring,3.0,,boring. still look like the old one and never change. should have change the inside and interior. the second floor is empty.
,,Revisit the Fun Place :),5.0,,"Our renewed experience started at 10am. We took MRT to the nearest station - Jurong East. And walked through a crowded street full of food and shops for ~10min. Upon arrival, we were welcomed by Kinetic garden. I personally love the butterflies section, VR stimulator and brain lab as well as the science presentation at 3pm.

I would certainly recommend this place for families with kids but it is also amazing for adults as well. The thing is that you will genuinely just never get bored of this place due to the insane amount of fun and interesting things you can find to do inside. The entire place is very well planned and well organised. It is worth the ticket to revisit the centre again and again, I can assure you that you will never get bored of the place."
,,suitable for all want know more,5.0,,"You need a whole day. It starts from 10 am. Science center is good for adults and teenagers. For children, it is good if an adult is to accompany them and describe. The explanations are in English and popular local languages. There are many items from many different sciences, and most of them are entertaining, like mirror maze etc. Don't lose the Tesla tests which is usually at 17:00. There are some additions to the science center which needs an extra ticket (payment). The ""omnitheatre"" usually has specific programs and I recommend that you see the program in advance and choose it if you like it. It is a 40 minutes video in English. The snow field is mostly planned for the residents of tropical countries. The KidsStop is a suitable place for kids under 9 year old. It is very safe and if your child can read/talk English well you can stay out (at a convenient hall where your kid can come across as the ticket is multi-entrance and the kids can come out and get in several times). There are 2 restaurants (McDonald and a local one) and you may use both of them. There are drinking water available free as many places in Singapore and some vending machines.Free WiFi is available.
Enjoy."
,,Fun. Learn. Explore,5.0,,Our family had a wonderful time here. We learned a lot and got amazed on every details inside the centre. Definitely worth the visit!
,,Good for older kids,4.0,,"I would certainly recommend this place for families with kids around 12 years or older. There is lots to learn and everything is well presented. Our kid was 9 years and while she still enjoyed the experience she didn't have the patience to try and understand what she was seeing. They do have an attached facility called Kidstop for younger children but that costs extra and we also did not have enough time to try that out. We enjoyed the Tesla coil presentation.

If you have younger kids in tow, do not forget to bring swim suits, there is a wet play area that they are sure to enjoy.

Do not miss the OmniTheater which is attached to the facility. Separate tickets are required for the Omni Theater but we felt it was worth it."
,,Fun for the whole family. Check it out.,5.0,,"Kids will have a blast and so will the adults. Science made fun has no age restriction. If you’re interested in the brain, electricity, ageing and even illusions just to name a few, this is the place for you.
We took our children 2, 6 and 11 there and they had so much fun, so did my husband and I. My husband and I ended up in the ageing section while the kids were ummm, no where and yet everywhere. The place is huge. We ended spending 6 hours there and still didn’t get to try everything. If you’re in Singapore, give this a try. It’s SUPER FUN!"
,,Good place for Singaporeans,4.0,,"This is my second visit in less than a year, and there is a new exhibit on Fear which I really enjoyed. Not as scary as the rope-climbing Einstein which I had feared since the time I had been to the Science Centre when I was young (haha). Went back to the mirror maze and I still enjoyed the experience.

The earthquake simulation was something I looked for when I first stepped into the Science Centre again, and I enjoyed it very much.

All the exhibits made me learn something new and refreshed my memory on what I have seen before.

The dialogue on ageing was also very insightful, with activities that simulated real problems that could happen to the body after growing old. The woman who brought us around was also very patient and taught us how to use items at the various zones.

Great to have many updates to the Science Centre in such a short time span, and it is a great place for Singaporeans to spend the day as it is free, just bring along your NRIC!

The only negative experience I had was the rude, entitled tourist children pushing me away from the exhibits when I have just started using them. (Happened more than 5 times with different children). Parents were either not around their kids or not teaching their kids the proper manners."
,,medium experience could use an update,3.0,,The Science centre was a bit lacklustre. There were a few interesting moments but the displays lacked depth. Seemed more cared to the ADD screen addict crowd rather than interested minds and intellectuals. Sad to see children so confined mentally.
,,Exceeded expectation - lots to do for aging science center,4.0,,"This was the first time I returned to the Science Centre Singapore with my eight-year-old daughter for several years. I was reluctant since I remembered it as being aging and not as appealing as I thought it would be to my daughter. However, this most recent trip was wonderful. yes, this is a bit old now but they have a lot of different activities. top of the list for my daughter was the butterfly experience where she spent a full hour. butterfly places can be boring because, frankly, butterflies are there or they aren't - but in our case, there were enough to make it interesting in a circular exhibit area, available with magnifying glasses for up close viewing. After that, we toured the 'centre' which had a lot of new exhibits, most notably one based on ' fear' which was a lot of fun and indeed educational. inside, you can trace the history of what scared people, but in fun ways, and enjoy more than a few interactive exhibits. Then there is a floor on medical science, the fire demonstration, etc., etc. That said, there were at least several interesting areas which were not working or just a bit neglected - for example, a kids workshop which seemed to have all kinds of things to do but so many broken and no one staffing it. Anyway, the kids seemed to have a good time and the staff were quite helpful and friendly. Definitely worth a trip at least once a year. Of course, there are other attractions at the same location, including the Imax theatre (gets good reviews) and the snow place (which doesn't). Oh, we did go to the Kidstop placeplace which was expensive but lots of good fun. So, more than easy to fill an entire day here."
,,Very good,5.0,,"I was bring my 8years old Son, he loves it. Enjoy all the show. But need more time, at least 6hours to visit it all. Love the Omni Theater"
,,Very good place to visit for kiddos,5.0,,"This place is suitable for kids. They can play and learn about science in there.
Don't forget to try Omni Theater and butterfly garden which we can touch the butterfly and take a picture with them.
For mommy who loves photography, so many spot in there to take a picture.
very recommended place to visit"
,,Lots of activities,4.0,,"My kid just enjoyed this place very much, many activities for visitors. Up close with the butterfly is fun too, though not many butterflies at the exhibit. Definitely a good place to visit with kids."
,,good for school kids interested in science,3.0,,"Good for senior school kids. Phobia section is really good.

Below are some of the shows:
At 11:00 in Hall A: Seeing Heat show, Defending science exhibition
At 12:00 in Atrium: Tesla Coil Demonstration, Cloud ring
At 15:00 in Courtyard: Fire Tornado Demonstration

There is Omni Theatre and Snow City nearby which you can cover on same day."
,,Must-go place if you like science,5.0,,"You can definitely spend your whole day there. There are a lot of exhibitions and shows there. I only spared half day there so I didn’t have enough time to visit all the places. I love the exhibition about fear, very interesting. There are also a lot of games that both children and adults can enjoy. Worth the ticket price!"
,,Informative!,5.0,,"This place is a good place that you can learn about Science with the exhibits.

There are endless information provided to give you in depth learning about Science.

A very good learning place for both children and adults and certainly suitable for family bonding as well.

Will suggest to avoid this place during school holidays as the crowd here can be overwhelming. Finding parking space can be a hassle during this period as well."
,,Enjoyable but many non-functioning exhibits were not maintained,3.0,,"Brought my teenage son there. Bought tickets via online, and it was quick and easy to redeem online ticket at their customer service centre.

Many exhibits to keep children enthralled, but it was quite dissappointing to find many exhibits were not functioning. Surprisingly for a nation like Spore.

The flame tornado was one of the highlights. Impressive with simple set up.

Choice/variety of food was also unfortunately very limited, and located outdoor with no air-conditioning."
,,Not too engaging..can be skipped,3.0,,"Science park was not upto our expectations, we have seen much better science parks than this !! Live tornado show was interesting, and have good knowledge . Show at omnitheatre was good, butterfly close can be interesting for kids , but overall it has very less Science activities"
,,A short visit to Science Centre,5.0,,"Last weekend we visited the science centre for a short visit but ended up the whole day there. There are so many interesting activities at the Kids Stop, Snow City and the Omni Theatre. Most of the activities are interactive and educational especially for the children.
The Science Centre open daily but closed on Monday except school and public holidays. There are upcoming events like ""one kind of science musical"" at the end of Sept 2018, with fun and educational activities. Good for the whole family to enjoy real snow at Snow City. Enjoy and have fun, we did."
,,Learning about science,4.0,,"We went to the Science Centre around 11am. It was fairly busy with a few schools organising excursions to the centre as well. Some older exhibits are under maintenance but many new exhibits have been put up. The kids love the new Mirror exhibit as they navigated through confusing “tunnels” created using mirror illusions, and they also enjoyed the new section on phobias. The centre is divided into 5 different segments touching on various branches of science topics. And it was a thrill to see a chick breaking out of its shell (very slowly). If you go through each section slowly and take the time to read, you can probably spend up to 3h or more here. Visitors should bring swimmers for the outdoor water play too (closed if weather is bad). Recommend a good chinese lunch at Lijiang Restaurant (adjoining building to the main centre, where Kidstop is) as the little cafeteria within does need to improve on the food quality. And when done, cross the road to Jurong East central for some retail therapy."
,,Mostly good but educational?,4.0,,I have been here 3 times over last 6 years. Starting to look a bit worn through heavy use. It is expensive but especially their feature exhibitions are extremely well done. My grandkids are probably on the young side for much of the didactic stuff though they enjoy turning wheels pressing buttons flashing lights as much as any kids and particularly enjoyed the outdoor stuff.
,,Brilliant Rainy Day Activity,5.0,,"What to do with two little ones on a rainy day in Singapore, take them to the Science Centre :)
Easy to get to via public transport, take the train to Jurong East and then walk (mostly undercover so you won't get very wet...plus you can grab some delicious snacks from the various eateries along the way.
One of the best things about the Centre is that is you are a member of any of the ASTC Science centres you get free entry.
You can easily spend the whole day here, with indoor and outdoor activities (plus a huge water park if it's hot).
We will definitely visit again..."
,,Good on a rainy day,4.0,,Took the kids back here this morning for another visit. It provides a relatively cheap outing on a rainy day. Plenty of interesting exhibits to keep the kids entertained for a few hours. The butterfly exhibit is small and not worth the entrance fee: consider the free butterfly enclosure in T3 transit zone next time you’re at the airport instead.
,,A nightmare,1.0,,"This is no Petroscience Museum in Kuala Lumpur. Far, far away from it, unfortunately.
Confusing at the ticket counter - you have 1 general admission, but then there are several exhibits for which you have to pay more to have access to.
Science centre - messy. No clear path. It's easy to enter an exhibit the wrong way. Again, no Petroscience Museum, unfortunately.
Movie - the dome is of course impressive. Unfortunately, herds of yelling-irrespectful-bad-behaved students ''monitored'' by ''teachers'' with their noses stuck on their smartphones (cannot live without Instagram or Facebook, right?) completely ruined more than half of the movie, until I heavily complained with one of the ''teachers''. Management not only let these groups (around 150 kids) in the theater while the movie had already started (while the other spectators HAD TO BE there 10 minutes before the beginning), disrupting it, it didn't monitor the session at all. There was so much yelling and laughing that it was impossible to follow the narrator. And nobody cared. Horrible, horrible experience. Complete waste of time and money.
Butterfly exhibit - maybe the biggest one in Singapore, indoor. But absolutely miserable compared to the simple exhibit in the Singapore zoo. Also complete waste of time and money.
Coffee Bee - avoid this place at all costs. Any simple food stall in any simple food court anywhere in Singapore will serve food that is 10.000 better.
My kids and I completely wasted our day.
Avoid it at all cost."
,,School trip,5.0,,"So good here! There are thousands of different exhibits, each of the areas is very well put together. We liked all of what we saw. I would imagine it's not cheap here so plan carefully and spend at least a morning here."
,,Exploring Science,5.0,,Family friendly and teen friendly! Pay a sum of $6 for entrance into Science Centre. They currently have this mirror maze exhibit which was my favourite. They also have a fire tornado show at 3pm which was pretty cool as well! Nice place to spend around 4 hours at!
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"It’s worth the entrance fee if you have the time to spend there. We went to Kids Stop and the Science Center with our grandchildren (ages 3,5 & 7) for 4 hours and did not see or do all that was there. Exhibits were well done and the staff were plentiful and attentive."
,,Nice place,4.0,,"The place is near Jurong East MRT station,the exhibition is very interesting and very scientific . it is very big so you are recommended to eat first"
,,Educational visit,4.0,,"Great place to visit with kids. Although a little far out of the city, and a short walk from the MRT station, we weren't disappointed. Be prepared to spend a full day here, so much to see and do. Definitely worth the price of admission."
,,Kids enjoyed their visit,5.0,,"The Science Center is a nice place to visit with the kids, as there are several really cool things to do here, both indoor and outdoor."
,,Must visit for family and curious individuals!,5.0,,"The place is not far from Jurong East MRT station, quite east to reach.
Their exhibitions are all interesting that were quite mind blowing and their details and presentations were very well appreciated! It is a very educational visit for families with children, good for them to get in touch with science. For kidults, it is a wonderful playground with fascinating exhibitions in and out of the centre!"
,,Fantastic place to feed your curious mind!,5.0,,"Very engaging, insightful and fascinating displays and shows, a great place for kids (and adults!) to learn and still have fun. Loved their Fire Tornado show and Aurora movie at the Omni Theatre. Spent approx 5 hours there but wish to stay even longer! Plan your visit well."
,,Highly engaging,4.0,,"We were in two minds whether to visit the Science Centre as it is a way out of the city centre and we thought it might be primarily for locals.

We took a Grab which cost about $15 rather than spend the 55 minutes on public transport to get there. On arrival we showed our Scitech Scitrekkers cards and were granted free entry. You can pay extra for the Omnitheatre and Butterfly encounter, but we decided to give the general exhibits a go first.

We were there for about 3 hours and the kids had a great time with the interactive exhibits. Like all of these places some of the exhibits were a bit tired, but mostly up-to-date and well designed.

Highlights were the mirror maze and the phobias display. The live shows including the fire tornado and the light show were excellent and the boys really enjoyed them. The staff were really passionate.

We took the MRT back to our hotel and it was pretty straightforward. The station is about a 10 minutes walk and the trains took about 50 minutes."
,,Perfect for families with young kids,5.0,,"We have enjoyed 3 hours in Science Center at Kidstop, Butterfly Up and Close and Science Center itself. Our kids aged 3 and 9 loved it as much as we did. There is a McDonalds at the entrance in case you want to give a break. Very nice attractions for kids to keep them busy. Best afternoon in Singapore. Highly recommended."
,,Interactive fun,5.0,,"We were all adults and we enjoyed each part of the museum, especially the Phobia: Science of Fear and the Mirror Maze. It's great for kids and kids at heart!"
,,Learn and Play,5.0,,"Interesting place for educational and playing at the sake time. Not only children, but adult who accompany them Will also learn something. Highly recommended."
,,Waste of time,1.0,,This place is so run down with obvious patches all over the place. Went in the late afternoon and can see some so-call exhibits not working. Empty so you can’t get any staff to help guide a bit on what to do since it’s such a sad place. We left wondering why we bother coming. Food sold at crazy prices there so please either eat before or plan for meals after visiting that place.
,,Enjoyed Butterflies Up Close,4.0,,"Science Centre is big and has various exhibitions. Unfortunately, some exhibitions can be closed without warning. For example, Phobia2 was closed when I visited even though the website did not indicate so, which was sad because I really enjoyed Phobia2 the previous time I visited.

Admission for the Butterflies Up-Close exhibition is $10 per person. There is a short guided tour which starts at 2.30pm daily. Our tour guide was really friendly and shared information with us, as well as allowed us to try handling chrysalises. However, even if you do not join a guided tour, the exhibition space provides brief write-ups and interactive media. Before entering the live butterfly enclosure, you can pick up a butterfly species identification guide. The enclosure is small but interesting, as there are different butterfly species such as the Common Rose (Singapore’s national butterfly), Great Mormon, Common Lime, Swift Peacock, and The Clipper. You can interact with the butterflies by gently placing your fingers under their front legs. Magnifying glasses and microscopes are available for the curious-minded. You can probably spend half to one hour in the Butterflies Up Close exhibition. If you like the Butterflies Close Up exhibition in Science Centre, you might also like the Butterfly Park and Insect Kingdom in Sentosa, as well as the Butterfly Garden in Changi Airport Terminal 3."
,,Wonderful day for family,5.0,,"We spent almost a day in the science centre and omni theatre with our young kids during our short trip to Singapore.

It is so informative for learning and experimenting, the kids are attracted to most of the exhibits. The fire tornado, mirror maze are amongst the unique exhibit. I would say this is the best science centre in the region and it is so well maintained and up to date since my first visit back in 80s.

The omni theatre is yet another highlights that even the adults will also be enjoyed. We opt for the Aurora movie and it is so wonderful that one would really feel like sitting under the sky with thousand stars and with the amazing northern lights.

Definitely recommend to all the family with kids. You can purchase the discounted picket via some agent online and the discount can be as high as 50%."
,,Amazing...,5.0,,"If you are with kids and not visit science centre than your visit to Singapore is not complete. It is a Must family activity. You only learn learn and learn. Remember to spend as much time as possible may be whole day.
We bought combined ticket for science centre+ Butterflies up-close+Omni theatre movie from Klook and got a good deal.
Please remember to catchup with show timings...
Closes sharp at 6 pm..."
,,So many exhibits,4.0,,This place is too cool. Has so many exhibits and so many gadgets. I remember as a 14 year old getting to play the PS3 when it wasnt out yet
,,A great afternoon of fun (and learning),4.0,,"A wonderful afternoon watching our children giggle, laugh and be amazed by so many things. The best way for any of us to learn. Very lucky it closed at 6, we could have stayed for a few more hours.
The circus was not as interesting and we wouldn’t do that again."
,,My kids didn’t want to leave!,5.0,,"I know most people spend only 2-3 hours here, but we spent over 6 hours. Great place if you are interested in Science & how things work. From optical illusion displays, mini hands-on experiments & exhibitions. Be sure to check out the mirror maze & the phobias room, we enjoyed these tremendously. Also will be a good idea to time your visit as not to miss out the Fire tornado show. We missed out on the Tesla coil demonstration as we had too much fun and simply lost track of time. Will be sure to visit the other buildings on our next trip to Singapore."
,,Ahmaziiiiing place for kids n adults alike 😍,5.0,,"So glad we visited this place, my son spend 6 hours here & asking to go again the next day

The place is clean, super cool & heaps of activity to experience for adult & kids alike. Even for Non Science lover

Theres orange juice machine at the enterance (2dollars ) & across the science center theres JCube mall with hawker foods beside it, the seafood resto was great"
,,Interesting destination,5.0,,"I have to say that I came to the centre with the minimal expectation . I was thinking that there will be nothing great and how were we going to spend thousands hours there !

To my surprise there are plenty of things to learn , to see , to be involved , and to enjoyed !

We could not complete the tour because there were too many things in the centre !

There was also a mini quiz and made the kids learn and keen to complete to get souvenir !

There was a great Christmas science live show which was amazing and enjoyable !

It’s a place which I will come again !"
,,A one of a kind fun for both kids and adults - spend a full day!,5.0,,"Science Centre was on top of our to-do list for our year-end Singapore holiday. A friend had recommended it highly and since my son (6 years) enjoys science we decided to devote a full day to this attraction. The only problem was that we were quite late in reaching the place (it is located in Jurong East and can take up to an hour from downtown if using public transport). We reached around 12, thankfully there was very little queue at the ticketing and we quickly made it to the main gallery. The exhibits are arranged thematically and are uniformly interactive and informative. It is the interactivity (as in being able to touch, turn, push, talk, play etc.) that made the place interesting (especially for those who may not usually be inclined towards science). A few hours in we realized how big the gallery was, and how little we had actually covered. But nevertheless we took a quick lunch break (at the McD located inside) and went back in to continue. A note of caution for those going in to the Mirror Maze, we made the mistake of spending too much time in there, and as a result i started feeling dizzy and confused (!) after a point and made a quick exit through the emergency doors! We also purchased tickets for the Butterflies Up Close gallery. This is a special section devoted to Butterflies - after a few somewhat boring indoor displays there is an open area where different species of butterflies are bred. There are stands on which they have placed orange pieces, you can touch the juice with your finger tips to attract the butterflies. After some failed attempts, a few different species hopped on to our fingers and these provided for great photo ops and fun. But some visitors were a little more aggressive and were catching the butterflies by their wings and placing them on their children's hair for the purpose of pics, maybe this activity needs better monitoring. Though this is not a must-do, it provided a change of scene and allowed us to spend sometime outdoors. So go only if you really like butterflies (the entry fee for Butterflies Up Close is SGD10 for both adults and children). Back at the Science Centre, we spent more time exploring the other exhibits, and caught an interactive session on planets done by one of the staff, which was pretty engaging. We then moved on to the Tinkering Studio - where children were encouraged to construct their own path for a marble to make its way through a path on the wall. My son got very absorbed in to this activity and was it at it for a long time (and was also somewhat upset that his marble didn't make it all the way through his construction). This and the illusion themed exhibits at the front entrance where his most favourite parts. There were so many others we didn't see, due to the paucity of time. But on the whole, it was a fun-filled and curious day and i have promised to take my son back there the next time we make our way to SG. Will surely plan the next visit better in order to cover more of the exhibits."
,,Amazing science center,5.0,,"It was a rainy day in Singapore so we decided so spend an hour or two at Science Center, but ended up spending more than 6 hours wishing we could stay longer! The center is very interactive and great for kids, but adults can also have an amazing time. It reminded me why I love science. Definitively worth visiting!"
,,Good place for family,4.0,,"This place has a lot of activities for kids. We can learn about animal, weather, plan, ... and play wet Garden"
,,Great day!,5.0,,I took our kids ages 9-12 here during their x-mas break from school and expected to spend 3-4 hours here but they enjoyed it so much we spent the whole day. The Omni theatre movie was great and I wished we had been able to watch both movies that were available. There were lots of hands on activities and the staff working there were very helpful. Since it was during the week it wasn't that busy and we didn't have any lines. Its definitely not a newer science center but it has a lot to offer for the price.
,,Not bad,3.0,,Some interesting things to see here but plan and buy the tickets at the door. We wanted to go to the circus and had to head back to the ticket office and wait for 20 minutes to buy the tickets. We enjoyed the Omni theatre there too
,,Enjoyable!,5.0,,Fun and educational. Enjoyable for old and young alike. Spent half a day there and it was good. Although it was a long weekend there was no crowd at all. Skip the butterfly attraction if you can..save your money there and spend more time at the other main spots. Halal F&B available too.
,,Learning centre,4.0,,"This is a good place for science enthusiasts to learn more. With interactive learning being introduced here, learning can now be made more fun."
,,Extortionate. Walked in and walked out.,1.0,,"So it is around 18SGD for ONE exhibition. Yes, you have to pay separately for each one and there are quite a few. Disgraceful. It should be one fee on entry into everything."
,,Good but expensive,3.0,,"Went here on our last day in Singapore
We went 2 adults and a 4 year old

It’s a big place so save a whole day
Was expensive though for what it was and a number of exhibits were closed which was very disappointing, we weren’t told they were closed and still charged full price which was a bit cheeky

We went to the circus, sc, Omni theatre
It was a long day"
,,Not just for kids,4.0,,"This is a center that has something for everyone. Some of the exibits are a bit old and some were broken, but there were plenty more to keep it interesting. The teslar and tornado shows were amazing. You need to allocate a whole day to really get the most out of this center. Enjoy the presentations and definitely go through the mirror maze. This is not just for kids, as an adult I was amazed and entertained by the science and dedicated presenters and volunteers. Unfortunately there was no free wifi which was disappointing - my only criticism."
,,Aging gracefully...,4.0,,"Despite its age (must be more than 40?), we never feel dull here nor have ever completed looking through everything in one visit. Exhibits get renewed periodically though i must say some are really showing their age, being broken or outdated (quirky inventions on 2nd floor needs to be replaced soon! ).

However there is still a lot of positives for this museum. The new optional illusions exhibits at the front are really fun, and the mirror maze will impress you.

Best part it's free for PR and Singaporeans on weekdays outside school holidays, we never knew that! All of us from 2 years, 9, 13 and 40s enjoyed the visit so much."
,,For the Kid and Student in You,4.0,,"Must visit. Rest of the summary is justifying first two words. All the sections are different, interesting, intriguing, fun, amazing, and well thought through. Illusions, maze, labs, and much more fun. It is best place to learn in fun way. Can’t write more as anticipation is also a flavour. Must visit. Cheers"
,,Really very very nice!!,5.0,,"Came here for the first time to see what was the whole craze about here. Pricing to enter was reasonable, but the most amazing thing was how they used the concept of games to knock Science facts into our heads! We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. But be warned. If you are on a tight schedule don’t come here or you will have regrets. The place is so big, you need 2.25 hours at least to see the entire place and check out all the exhibits. Oh, and there is a cafe inside the area, it’s ok but tad bit pricy. And I recommend you to come at 3pm, and come to the area next to the cafe. There will be a fire tornado performanc which is epic!"
,,Great place of learning,5.0,,"Was looking for a place to spend our afternoon and since it has been some time ago that we last visited Science Center, we decided to come for a visit. As the kids are older now (12 and 8 years old), they thoroughly enjoyed the three hours we spent here, including the outdoor Kinetic Garden. If not for the closing time, we would have stayed longer. Will be back for the Circus Exhibits. Thanks Science Centre, for the great learning we had."
,,Worth a visit if you have time....especially kids,4.0,,"This is not the best science centre if you have travelled globally (say compared to London or NY). But if you have kids, and have time.... its great few hours spent (rather than strolling endless malls) and its not very expensive (20$...lesser if booked on Klook). I would have gone a 2nd day again if i had time. My son (8 yr) and I thoroughly enjoyed... and the best part is it is not frequented by international travellers as much as the other places like Sentosa/ Zoo/ Universal."
,,Great day out with a curious seven year old,5.0,,"This is truly worth the travel, a great day out. We used MRT to get there, Jurong East station. We went with the normal entry price, there was so much to see and do, we didn't need the additional shows etc. the fire and electricity shows were pretty cool. Our 7 year old enjoyed the water area the most, you need to bring swim suits etc for that.

Overall, a really good experience which I recommend to everyone. I booked the tickets through an app called Klook."
,,Great Fun in Singapore,5.0,,"As a kid I have always loved going to the Science Centre and now I enjoy bringing my kids there. There are just so many activities and new ones are frequently being launched too. There's a KidsStop which is loads of fun for the kids and recently there is a Build-a-Dino exhibit which my kids enjoyed. My personal favourites at the Science Centre are the Optical Illusions section and the Omni-Theatre (which is quite costly, however). Be prepared to spend at least half a day here as there's just so much to see and learn."
,,Give yourself time - you may need to revisit!,5.0,,"You will need at least a full morning to explore this centre - and then return on numerous other occasions to explore more. The centre caters for children of all ages and abilities, providing a range of interactive and intellectually challenging experiences for the curious. I visited with my young grandchildren who loved the varied experiences the place offered, and will definitely make many visits over time. Highly recommended."
,,The Butterfly exhibition at Science Centre should be closed down!,1.0,,"My family was at the Science Centre today. As my niece loves butterflies, we bought tickets for the so-called ""Singapore's First Indoor Butterfly Sanctuary"" (normally $10 per person). When purchasing the tickets, we were ""advised"" that the population of butterflies will not be ""so much"". I was told it used to be over 300, but now, only 100+. I asked the guy, shouldn't the tickets be discounted then? He said yes, we were only paying $8 as part of the package price.

While the Science Centre itself (especially the Mirror Maze) was definitely huge value for money and we did spend several hours there, the same cannot be said of this butterfly exhibition which we had to pay an undeserved separate charge.

When we went in, we were shocked - it was NOTHING like what was shown in the Science centre website. Only 1 butterfly was brought to my niece, with the rest of the butterflies - all black - high up on a net (look at photo attached). My niece was so disappointed and even though she is only 6 years old, she remarked, ""Cheat people's money!""

We could not agree with her more. We were out in less than 15 mins.

Perhaps when the exhibition started in April 2016, it was as vibrant as what the video showed. I am not sure in the past year and a half, how many butterflies have died under the stress and duress of having so many visitors. What we saw today was a sorry sight.

The Science Centre should close down the Butterfly exhibition and return the remaining butterflies to where they came from."
,,Exhibits with buttons galore,4.0,,"Went on school trips as a child and living on the east side, i dont go very often.
But after 24 years, it brings back fond memories where almost everything looks the same but maintained well.
Lots of things to see, many halls to discover. My one complaint is the exhibits could have more of a reaction after the kids press the buttons. Some of the buttons pushed had little or even dull activations. Kids want to see things light up to keep their attention. Some didnt work at all. The kid in me was disappointed. I suppose it is a lot of work to do on each exhibit and it takes a lot to engage kids nowadays. Especially the iPad generation.
But i have nothing to moan about as it was very good value for money where me and my son as locals paid only $6 for me and $4 for him.
Highlight was that crazy mirror maze, thought itd be easy but was quite a challenge and i got a bit of a panic attack as we went deeper and deeper into it. Had to keep cool for my boy but i was like omg omg omg. We managed to escape. I mean exit. Weirdly, reminded me of my first marriage.
The science demo show at 4pm was interesting, funny and the hosts entertained my son and the auditorium.
I love you science centre, i grew up with you in primary school.
Why cant we have you on the east side."
,,Best and cheapest fun in singapore,5.0,,What an awesome array of interactive exhibits. Plenty to interest all children and many exhibits were hands on. Some closed for renovation at the moment but you can easily spend 6 hours there. Great 3D exhibits which also added a nice touch. Worth the cab ride to get there from the city
,,Quite an unexpected experience,4.0,,"This place was surprising good - nice, relaxing and not crowded, and a fun way to experience aspects of science. My kids loved it so much that they wanted to stay longer than planned. You can easily spent a few hours here. Highly recommeded, especially for kids."
,,Surprisingly fun place to be!,5.0,,We visited with our 2 kids (age 6 & 9) and the place was not full with a large crowed. We had our own time there and enjoyed the 12pm Tesla show which was very entertaining. The glass maze was super fun! We had a good family time there. One can cover the science centre and then walk to Snow city for more icy fun!
,,Surprisingly good,5.0,,"Its not known to be one of the must try attraction of singapore, but surprisingly for us it was one of the best experience and time we had in our tour.This is a wonderful gem of a place specially for kids from 5-15 years. So many things to learn and experience also. Highly recommended dont miss it.Its slightly far from city center."
,,Science in a leisurely and entertaining manner,5.0,,We need a spot to appreciate aspects of science in a leisurely and entertaining ways. A spot that popularise science by creating an environment where we can indulge in participatory learning. This place answer that challenge. Various exhibits spanning various disciplines are basically incubators of scientific knowledge and emphasises hands-on exploratory learning rather than a formal text-based approach. Well done Singapore.
,,Its amazing,4.0,,"I loved the center and my husband too, many interesting things and electric show and the have one big theatre which gives you the almost 360 degrees pictures except the movie we went its very boring, i would not advice the family to visit with very young children"
,,Not as interactive as others,3.0,,"As science centres go this one is not as hands on as others. If you've been to the science centres in San Francisco, Brisbane, Mecau you can give this one a miss. it's very text and photo based and not as hands on as others I've visited. Miss six enjoyed other science centres we visited, but quickly became bored here.

One feature that was interesting was the egg hatchings. The centre has around a dozen chicken eggs at the end of the 21 day gestation period sitting under heat lamps. While we were there one of the eggs moved and started to crack. I guess if you're patient enough you'd see a chicken hatch. Or watch one on YouTube.

Dedicated science enthusiasts may enjoy, but not ideal for children with short attention spans."
,,Forever interesting place,5.0,,"This place has many events and programmes throughout the year. Just went to their makers faire 2017, it was fantastic! A venue and yearly event for children and individual at showcase their inventions! The science centre itself has a lot to explore! From human body to space!"
,,Not worth the trip,2.0,,"We had just about enough time to see some dinosaur robotic stuff, which was pathetic to say the least. Don't waste your time and money."
,,7 yrs old daughter and me loved it,5.0,,"Went with my 7 years old daughter and only left 5 hours later when we were both exhausted! The exhibitions are very good and varied enough that would entertain different people (we liked some, we didn't bother with others, but overall there is something good for everyone).
My daughter knows about TripAdvisor and asked me to give 5 stars also because of the amazing water park outside (need ticket to use) which was one of the best we have seen in Singapore, included in the price of the ticket!

I would personally not advise to buy ticket for both the science center and the Kids Stop on the same day as we went back another day to Kids Stop and it was another 2 hours and even though my daughter is a Duracell bunny in terms of energy, I don't think she could have done both on the same day."
,,Education amidst fun display and activities,4.0,,"The exhibits are interesting with the right amount of education information as well as fun activities. We were in deep holiday mood and browsed only briefly but if one spend more time reading the information accompanying the exhibits one can learn a lot.
My kids were amazed by the loads of ""illusion exhibits"", and the maths games were interesting too.
The only down side was that it was quite far away from city center, though still quite easily reached by MRT + bus."
,,Not just for Kids,5.0,,Our teenagers had a blast at the science museum. We were here for 4-5 hours my daughter thinks it's one of the best we've been to in our travels. Even the big kids enjoyed it.
,,good place for kids,4.0,,it is a nice place for kids. you get off at Jurong East MRT and walk a bit or take a bus to reach there. but omni theater and other attraction has separate tickets. that way you can plan your trip. limited options for food.
,,Enjoyed our visit,5.0,,We went to see the mirror maze and truly loved our time there. A great place for children where the exhibits were so interesting and educative too. Highly recommend.
,,Good for children 8 plus,3.0,,The Science centre had lots of military info which our son's loved. OmniTheatre didn't have planetarium movie but was still great! Good escape from a hot day.
,,A good distraction,4.0,,I visited here with my 4 year old son - to bide some time. It's an old centre but he loved the display and kids top! Well worth the $10 taxi ride out from Marina. Be warned Kidstop is closed from 12:30 - 2:00pm. Looking a little tired and old but good value for money and attentive staff.
,,Good science centre for all ages,4.0,,"After few years, it was my second visit and my son still like it.

The centre is well maintained and I could see different exhibitions. This time they have mirror maze which my son explored it happily several times.

It has a water playground so prepare yourself with extra clothes if your children plan to spend times in the playground.

You can also visit Omni Theatre or Snow City which are located next to the centre."
,,Not suitable for young kids,3.0,,Young kids will be bored there because it suits an older kid (perhaps age 8 onwards) Omni theatre experience was ok
,,Great for kids learn about science,5.0,,A great place for kids to learn about science. You must come here if you are visiting singapore with family
,,Like huge toy store,5.0,,"We always been here while we go to spore. My son spent 6 hours here. Always notice.the demonstration, it's always interesting. Science centre like huge toy store for my son. Kids can touch everything."
,,Good way to spend time with kids,4.0,,"We had an enjoyable Sunday at the Science Centre with our young son. The robotic Dinosaur was a great attraction, as was the Kidspost and the IMAX theatre shows.

Season tickets buy access to the Centre as well as the Snow City and other attractions.

It is clearly very easy to spend a day here, absorbed in all the learning activities that it offers.

And the availability of a variety of dining options is added plus."
,,Great for kids,1.0,,"I rate this so low as it would be wonderful for children. But was asked at the entrance if this was a kids science center, we were told ""No there is much in it for adults""

Not at all true, if you don't know the majority of content inside as an adult, you should probably think about going back to school or getting a better internet connection.

Hundreds of kids everywhere with everything in design for them to learn an interact. Fabulous for them. As a couples day out, just a waste of time and money. The rating is only low, because it appeared to be for children, and when asking, before entering, we were told there's plenty for adults... just not true."
,,Kids enjoyed it,5.0,,Kids should definitely visit this place. There are so many things the kids will enjoy. The fire tornado show is a must watch for kids.
,,"Cheap, Educational and Fun",4.0,,"With interactive educational games, the Singapore Science Centre is the place to bring children. In fact a lot of schools in Singapore organized field trips to the Science Centre.

Entry fees are affordable and themed displays change every 3 - 6 months.

During non school holiday periods, entry is free for Singaporeans, just bring along your IC or passport.

The place isn't huge, but nothing in Singapore is, since land and space are limited and expensive in the country.

A new water feature for kids outside the Science Centre is also available for anyone, it doesn't require an entry fee, but it outdoors.
McDonald's is situated in the vicinity as well, just before you walk into the Science Centre building."
,,Worth the trek!,5.0,,This a great venue for anyone visiting Singapore with kids. It is very hands on with multiple attractions all in the same location. There is a McDonalds as well as a couple of other food vendors so plan on making a day of it. The splash pool is science oriented in case you run out of things to do inside. The entry fee is reasonable too. It is someway out of the touristy area but can be reached on the green line with a 6/7 minute walk once you get off the MRT. A good opportunity to see a less glitzy side of Singapore.
,,Educational place,4.0,,I signed up using the ASTC passport program. It is nice to enter for free. Or else pay $12 per adult. A very educational place. There are many exhibitions and plenty to explore. You will need at least 3 hours to explore. Kids can get wet at the waterworks. There is also other facilities like snow world nearby. Jurong east mrt is 10 minutes away.
,,A place that every student should visit,4.0,,Wonderful edutainment place every student should visit but make sure you have more than a day so you can get most of it
,,Perfect place for the curious minded,4.0,,"I visited the Science Centre twice within 6 months (December 2016 and June 2017) with friends and equally enjoyed both visits (we're all in our 20s) because of the educational and interactive exhibits. There has been installation of new exhibits since my first visit showing that management puts active efforts into updating the content.

I spent around 4 hours there including lunch and a visit to the Omni theatre. Definitely make sure you see the impressive fire tornado show at 3PM because it only runs once a day.

If you are visiting on a Friday afternoon, make sure to stay back to visit the observatory as well (free of charge)! More details about the star gazing is on their website and Facebook page."
,,Excellent educational examples,4.0,,"The exhibits were highly practical for anyone searching to understand science.

Although a few exhibits were damaged, probably from abuse, the rest were well maintained.

May be losing popularity for the teens who seem to prefer electronic gadgets than these physical devices.

I would think that then venue was still relevant today except maybe, some ingenuity ought to be added to the exhibits.

Many elementary schools were having their field trips here."
,,Great fo Kids,4.0,,There are many different Science Centres/Exhibitions. Children can learn and enjoy Good for kids too. It is educational and fun. Great to see your paintings becoming part of demonstrated paintings
,,Nice,4.0,,"I went to singapore science center during weekday with my family.
There are a lot of great topics that children can learn there.
i think the place is more suitable for children aroung primary school ages.
It was just unfortunate that we couldnt be able to try the oculus in the space area."
,,Science Centre - Many exhibitions available!,4.0,,This is a good place for tourist and even locals with children to go! Average visiting time is about 2-3 hours. No worries about food a there is a small eatery inside the place to let you fill your tummy! Enjoy!
,,Very educational trip,5.0,,It has many educational exhibits on Mathematics and Science. One of the main attractions is the flying virtual reality simulator. You will get to fly like a bird over a city.
,,Still fun!,4.0,,"My friend and I decided to come here again. It has been a few years since we last came, more than 10 years actually.
The main central area hasn't changed. So nostalgic to see familiar exhibits that I used to love interacting with. Unfortunately for us, more than half of the place has drastically changed over the years.

Lots of stuff have become electronic. I feel that people usually go to Science Centre to interact with physical objects instead of reading off electronic boards or other things that can be done using their computer at home. I remember playing with life sized puzzles or hammering a metal plate that will strike the bell at the top.

Discovery zone has also closed. That was a super colourful, fun and interactive place that kids would go to.

One new exhibit that we enjoyed was the typhoon simulator, which you can enter and experience what it would be like.

Of course, sometimes technology makes things more fun! Through some consoles, we could control what happens on this giant screen in the E3 section of Science Centre. That section also has some Oculus Rifts available to play with!

Since there are quite some exhibits under construction, we didn't get to see the full Science Centre. However we will definitely be back after they are completed!"
,,Great experience for my kids,4.0,,Thx Singapore Science Centre Team. My kids had a fun. Omni theatre experience was great and over all we walked with few learnings and fun from this place
,,Useful time spent for Children,4.0,,"Among the various playful attractions in Singapore, I recommend this place as a must-visit for kids who are in 10-15 age group. It may take about 3-4 hours to walk through each theme-based area in the Science center. As a parent, I encourage you spend time with your kid on each of the poster, theme, act etc.. read the posters that explains the phenomenon and discuss with your kids.

The ones on brain, DNA, Earth are simply superb. Concepts are easily explained and learnable in a playful way so that it remains in kids' minds for ever."
,,Great family day out,5.0,,"From the spectacular to the informative, the exhibits were great.
We spent a full day here as a family. There are many interactive exhibits to keep all ages entertained.
Be sure to catch all the shows. Highlights are the fire tornado, and the lightning show.
Only thing we missed was the kids water park, as it was storming on the day we visited."
,,Good for children,4.0,,"We take the bus to visit this place, and it stops just in front of the centre.
The bus stop called science ctr. As we are a tourist so we need to pay to enter it.
The ticket price is updated in their website.
I only visit this place as my daughter watched some vblog in youtube about it, otherwise I don't think I will ever visit them.
But their displays is very good to students for learning purpose. I can even see a chick just hatch few hours before.. so cute and my kid love it.
There's also a square tyre bike that we can ride there. Few shows you don't want to missed including tesla coil and fire tornado, the timing is available in the map they give when we purchase the tickets or you can check it in their website"
,,Great days out,5.0,,"We've visited the science scentre a lot the past years. It's a fun place for kids and adults the experiment and play around. There are a few shows that you can watch. There are many exhibition, some brand new, some quite old. Check before hand if any exhibits are closed.
Also bring your swim suit since there is a great water play area.
Only downside is the lack of restaurants, there is one restaurant, but that's not as good as expected... You'll find a McDonald's just outside the entrance."
,,OK to visit,3.0,,"We went to Science Centre Singapore with high hopes and were, unfortunately, a bit disappointed. It was not bad but after having visited ArtScience Museum which we loved, this one left us cold. For us it was not worth the money spent (entrance tickets, taxis etc)"
,,Enjoyed !!!,5.0,,Children enjoyed the experience. Very informative and engaging . Lots of exhibits and interesting shows.
,,Not just for the young,5.0,,"There’s so much here. We’ve been coming for years, and always learn something new. This centre teaches adults as well as children.
We spent 2 days there this year, and didn’t have time to see everything. Make sure you see the Fire Tornado, 3pm Tuesday to Sunday, it’s awesome. Apart from that, just look around for things which interest you.
There’s a serious lack of places to sit. Upstairs we found just 1 seat! Toilets are easy to find, and, nafurally for Singapore, very clean. Watch out for a small step up as you leave some of the toilets, a real trip hazard.
The café in the centre is great for drinks. Meals are disappointing. We had fish and chips and rosemary chicken. The fish and chicken both lacked flavour. Vegetables were almost non-existent, just a small spoon of coleslaw. On our second visit, we ate in McDonalds (just outside the centre). Nice salad and corn, and tastier meat (and cheaper). I can’t believe I just wrote praising McDonalds for healthier food!
It's only a short walk from the MRT. The walk passes a number of boards describing the history of Jurong.
A visit here makes a splendid day, and stimulates the mind. No wonder the percentage of scientists to population in Singapore is so high."
,,Learning journey,5.0,,"Learning journey with my daughter, she love the place especially the waterworks. Overall, a great learning experience."
,,Fire Tornado!!!,5.0,,"Many reviews commented that it was dated. Last time I was here was 30 years ago and there was definitely more things to see and do. My sons were elated and enjoyed their time thoroughly. Unfortunately, I was hoping they would be able to touch the electric static globe to make their hair stands but one seemed to have been cordoned off for the Tesla Coils show. What a shame!"
,,Good but not amazing - Avengers not worth it,3.0,,"Went there today with my 2 and 4 year olds. The science centre had enough interesting things for both of them (kinetic garden, climate change, tesla coil show and fire tornado show). Could have spent moe time there as we didn't manage to cover the second floor.
Unfortunately we decided to go to the Avengers and that was a total disappointment: just a lot of screens - very busy and loud - definitely not suitable for young children. I personally find it outrageous that they charge 20 ssd for children 3 and over. It should be for children over 7 or so."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I have two words for you.

Tesla Coils!!!

Off to the Singapore Science Centre we go. Stormy (my 4yo) gets scared of the Earthquake generator (which is a pity because she loved it last time) but explores the volcano room. She visits the butterfly room, but won't let one touch her (they tickle). We watch the fire tornado show and she sits there, fascinated, by the flames. She doesn't quite understand the room on the human brain, but pushes all the buttons anyway to see what they do. She's my daughter."
,,"High entrance price, old fashion",1.0,,"Price too high comparing with other science museum around the world.

Some exhibition areas are under renovation but there are still road signs to direct you to go from one area to another.

Road signs in the center are not enough and misleading.

The Avengers exhibition has not much to see, we just keep seeing screens. The app cannot be connected to their network and we cannot experience much. Very disappointed especially with separate entrance fees."
,,Excellent full day trip for kids,5.0,,Huge places with lots of attractions for kids. Fun and knowledgeable. Need to spend whole day there to enjoy all parts of this place. Cheap entry tickets compared to other Singapore attractions.
,,limited visit time left for Avengers Station,4.0,,"I never been to science centre before but this time I was going to the Avengers Station, It is good to go alone or in a group. It is easier to take MRT till Jurong East then transfer bus to go there"
,,Science boffs visit here,5.0,,You will need more than one visit to telecom everything at this venue. We only scratched the surface of the center. It is costly so be prepared to spend the day if you want to get value for money. There are places to eat outside and you are stamped on the hand of arm so you can come and go during the visit. Watch out for the lightening show and the fire hurricane!!!!
,,Awesome kid day out,5.0,,"Fantastic (mostly) indoor science centre that entertained and educated our family. So many interactive exhibits to help kids and parents understand and appreciate various concepts. Air conditioned inside so perfect venue for relief from a wet or hot day.
We visited on a public holiday and the only down side was that MacDonalds was the only cafe/restaurant open. We spent half a day there - cold easily have spent the whole day there and watched a movie... we were tight on time. Excellent day out."
,,Skip Avengers,2.0,,"This review is mainly for Avengers STATION. Visited on a public holiday. Paid SGD20 for adult and 14 for child. There's actually an entrance to the Science Center from within the outdoor car park. Not much of a line there compared to the ticketing office at the main entrance.

There was another short line to get into the Avengers exhibit. Things were slightly slow but smooth.

Content wise, it looked like an extended edition of the Revenge of Ultron. Snippets of the movie accompanied by more details and background. These were mostly on large TV screens. There isn't much in terms of interactivity. In fact, for those, a number of stations were malfunctioning.

The main point of going for this would probably be the AR experience; to control Ironman's suit. However, the line was moving much too slow. After waiting for an hour, we abandoned the line.

Skip this unless your kids can patiently wait and really want to try AR."
,,Curiosity Answered,4.0,,Interesting and challenging displays. makes you question what you don't know but you discover new knowledge and consolidate your ideas about how things work.
,,Marvel Avengers exhibit,5.0,,Visited this place with our young ones on a short trip to Singapore. Fantastic special exhibit - Marvel Avengers S.T.A.T.I.ON. which our children totally loved.
,,Great design....,4.0,,This building apparently represents the opening of a lotus flower & is located on the marina bay. Although we never went inside there were lots of people who were buying tickets etc. it makes a great back drop for photos.
,,"Tired, dated and disappointing",2.0,,"I've been to a number of science museums/interactive science centres in various cities around the world and unfortunately this rates very poorly in comparison. Half the centre is closed for renovation (which it so badly needs) and the rear seems like it hasn't been touched since the mid 90s. It just feels worn out and forlorn - compared to say the buzz and energy that is generated within Questacon in Canberra.

Many of the exhibits didn't work, none of the staff seemed particularly interested, and most of the remaining exhibits were just not that interesting. The whole place has a musty smell, which after a while made me feel quite nauseous.

However, I did give it two stars as there were one or two things that interested my boys, and it was practically deserted which meant that didn't have to queue for anything."
,,"Loads of detail, but very limited shows",4.0,,"We've been three times before, with a 7 yr old, a 9 yr old and now a 13yr old (same child, different years!) There is an amazing amount of stuff to see and do, with in depth sections about climate change, radar, all sorts.

Unfortunately we came to revisit the tesla coil show and the fire tornado. We arrived 10 mins after the midday tesla coil show and 3hrs before the only fire tornado display, so left disappointed. These are really cool displays, why do they happen only once (or twice on weekends/public holidays) a day? This was a real let down...
There is also next to no signposting from the nearby MRT station, so good luck finding it!"
,,Well Done Science Centre !,5.0,,"The Science Centre is always the place to visit during the school vacation for my kids. The centre is always coming up with new attractions to re-invent itself. This time was the Butterfly attraction. Overall, the kids loved to explore the different stations and see how things work."
,,Good one,3.0,,Kids loved it and it has great show too. However you reach a point that you loose direction and you dont know what you have seen and havent. Kids got bored at some point later. Overall its a good one
,,Interactive activities for the kids,4.0,,My kids who are 4 and 6 loved the science centre. There are activities for both the young and old. Interactive for the kids which includes activities for the kids to participate in. There is a Macdonalds restaurant here.
,,Review for Avengers Station Exhibition Only,1.0,,"This exhibition is only for DIEHARD Avengers fans. Don't take children younger than 10 years! The Science Centre should specify the age appropriateness clearly. The fact that they don't, makes it seem like a scam, just to make money!

About the exhibit itself-it's a superbly created walk through but way too cumbersome. Too many things to do-first download an app to enter the exhibition; this takes a good 15 minutes and several tries! Then, upon entering the 'Briefing Room' the 'Training' starts. This is a laborious process-read through all the backstories of all the characters, then complete the assessments in the app and ultimately fight Ultron to be a successful agent. The whole exercise would take a good 2-3 hours if one needs to get value for money.

Not worth it if you're not a superhero junkie."
,,Visit avenger stations,3.0,,"Disappointed with such a price, no one guide on each station that make most of us confused. Not recommended. The main science Centre is generally good for children."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Overall Nice and Interesting experience ,You dont need to be kid to visit this as you will find find something that amazes you .Far from center but worth it"
,,Not just for kids,3.0,,"Out of curiosity, I visited the Science Centre since it had been years since I was there. Rather entertaining for all ages. My favourite was the ""Defending Science"" section. There were even interesting essays such as a meaningful prize-winning one entitled ""Filipino Scientists:Critically Endangered"". So you really don't have to have serious interest in science to have an enjoyable time there."
,,Avengers,3.0,,"There's a new temporary Avengers interactive exhibit and we brought the kids to have a look

Overall the Science centre is very old and heard they are moving to new premises next year

Besides Avengers, they screen nature movies, they have role-play Kidspot, a water playground, a snow playground , butterfly garden etc.

We just went around the general area and then Avengers. The latter is basically Disney doing its marketing thing. Download the app and the kids get to watch videos, see the costumes and play lame video games. And of course, a really large souvenir store at the end"
,,Educational and fun visit,5.0,,Brought both 7 and 5 yo to science centre. We were there from 12-6pm yet didnt managed to cover the 2nd floor and 50% of ground floor. Plenty of activities that the kids enjoy. Food was easily accessible too. Omni theatre was a good experience. We will go back again in future!
,,Boring for young kids,2.0,,"I visited here with my 3 years old kid.
Although I asked the center is it suitable for her, and they answered yes, my daughter got bored and didn't enjoy.
She just loved the butterflies part.
I think visiting this center is more useful for teenagers and schools.
Most of the areas and games were open just for groups.
Most of the parts needed a guide who explain what happened scientifically.
We were there in the afternoon and some games were closed at 5pm.
In my opinion it wasn't fair the butterflies ticket was separated and additional.
The kinetic park outside of the center was for free and my daughter got excited by playing there and learn science more than inside the center."
,,Avenger Station,3.0,,"We come here recently only for this exhibition. As we pay by NETS we got 10% discount. 1 adult and 1 kid priced less then sgd 40.

We need to download the application to fully enjoy into the mission. They also provide free wifi to facilitate this. For those who do not have smartphone the provide rental service at sgd 5 if i'm not wrong.

This establishment concept is quite good. However, according to me it is not suitable for younger children. On top of that, this exibition seems recently open but many items out of order. Like the captain america section. There are 3 machine like hand bike, 2 out of 3 out of order. Another problem in the iron man section. This section is quite popular. When we go that time we need to queue and quite long also. When come to our turn it already start and the person say can't restart and can't wait. So we just half play like that. I do not wish to complain to the officer as i do not wish to spoilt my son mood.

Inside the exhibition also got art and craft section that i feel overpriced. The price about sgd 5 for those really cheap material."
,,Excellent place for science lovers!,5.0,,"Science Centre is a wonderful place for the ones who keen to know more about the world around! It covers so many different subjects: aerospace, genetic & DNA, brain, visual affects, physics, natural energy, animals, meteorological science, optical illusions, electricity and many many more! Even more - each few months, new exhibition is opening, so it's always refreshing. For example now it hosts the huge exhibit about Avengers, Russian Aerospace Exhibition and Butterflies Exhibition.
Apart from science Centre, you can combine your visit with Omni Theatre (huge 3D cinema), where you can find movies about Cosmos, Dinosaurs, animals, unseen world etc on huge rounded screen.
Science Centre has also outdoor kinetic playground and water playground, where your kids can play learning some laws of Physics at the same time.
At a the next building is a Kids Stop - huge indoor playground for the kids, Snow City and Rock Climbing. Very cool and interactive place for families and kids! Highly recommend!!"
,,Great for kids but needs updating more often,3.0,,"The Science Centre Singapore has always been a staple attraction for me during our youth due to the proximity to my Dad's place.

A little background is that SCS is technically a Statutory Board of the Ministry of Education
and aims not to promote Science for students but also the general public.

The exhibits can take a while to change although as parents ourselves now,we do appreciate the new Waterplay areas in addition to the usual exhibits(which have remained the same in our last few visits with my family).

With it's pending relocation to nearer the Jurong lake, I will alwaystreasure the memories of this place along many other childhood places that have come and gone."
,,It is time....,3.0,,"I haven't been back here for close to thirty years, and it's apparent that this Science Centre is tired and needing a revamp badly. Anyhow, it's been confirmed that in due course, this Centre shall move closer to where other family friendly attractions are in Singapore. Out of curiosity, I came here for the latest Marvel's Avenger's exhibition. There are few highlights such as the Iron Man zone where people get to imagine themselves being Iron Man (Virtual Reality), and the props that are being used in the movies including the Hulk Buster. They are simply glorious. Apart from that, there are bits and pieces to explain about other Avengers' members and to relate them with real science. The cherry on the icing would be towards the very end when you get to upload an application where you get to shoot at Ultron on a big screen. It would most certainly make your children's day!! For old time's sake, do come and have a look at this Centre before it's been mothed. There are heaps of car parks."
,,You need one whole day here,5.0,,Perfect place for kids. Its educational and loads of fun.. a must visit. The best part is there is no dont touch areas and a well organized centre.
,,Avengers Exhibition!,5.0,,"Science center was not part of our itenary. However we came to know that they were hosting Avengers exhibition and it was a must see for my son. I am glad we went there. Its bit far from other attractions and hence takes almost half a day. walking distance from jurong mrt. We thoroughly enjoyed the avengers exhibition, it was very interactive and fun for all age groups. Didn't visit the science center as its same across globe."
,,Real KIDS place and with great value and maximum FUN,5.0,,Very informative and nice place to visit. Kids below 10 years will enjoy the technological display and information. time required would be about 3-4 hours. Better to visit the place by 10AM.
,,Fascinates both children andadults,5.0,,A superb introduction for children of all ages as to how the world and the things in it work. Plenty of hands on exhibits to inform and entertain with a strong bias on sustainability for the future of our world.
,,Fun Science,4.0,,"With our Petrosains (Kuala Lumpur) membership, we gained free admission. Plan to spend at least two hours. We spent about three hours at the general exhibition alone. The tesla coils were amazing, but may be scary to young children. May also consider bringing spare clothes for the children, to enjoy the outdoor waterworks and kinetic garden."
,,Don't miss if you are visiting Singapore with kids,5.0,,"Science center is quite interesting place ,especially for kids, Best time to visit is after 2 pm as one could watch many shows after 2pm . Activity duration is 3-4 hours depending on your interest. I suggest to club Jurong bird park ( in the morning ) and visit science center (afternoon) in a day. Kids would enjoy science center. Nearest MRT is Jurong East station. There are lot of food stations near MRT and one could Indian food too."
,,Better for families with primary school age kids,3.0,,"Better for families with younger primary school age kids.
One of the few Singapore attractions where you feel you got your moneys worth.
Only issue was allot of the displays were broken and not working properly.
Don't bother with the snow zone or the omni theatre."
,,Fun Day,5.0,,"We spend half day here, and that not enough. My son really enjoy this place. Every kids will like this place, because they can touch anything they want to touch. Tesla experiment is very amazing. Will be back here if we visit singapore next time.

Take a short walk from east jurong mrt station. Besides foodcourt at mrt station you also can have lunch at McDonald in the front gate of science centre."
,,Lots of stuff but time to renovate,4.0,,This place is definitely a blast for young children. They will enjoy it. However it might be time to renovate. Compared to other attraction around the city the place a bit outdated.
,,Great value and place,5.0,,"Great place to visit with kids. We made the mistake of going late in the day, 2pm, so could not see it all. Our fault. There is so much to do it's unreal and it is good value for money.
I must question the fact that they gave Mc Donald on site. Come on!
One other issue is that it closes at 6pm and if you wish to stay for the observatory show / viewing you need to hang around a bit.
However, it's still a brilliant, not to miss, place to visit when in town."
,,Kids Place to Enjoy,4.0,,My two children loved this place to bits and reluctant to go home. We did not even get to the second floor as we were rushing for our dinner thus heading back to the hotel. The best part of this place was an exhibition of tinker bells whereby kids get to make small projects and to complete a stamp card in return for a button badge. Also there was a tornado fire show whereby they are able to see the fire storm upclose. Really worth the trip and we will be returning for our next trip.
,,worth a visit - for part of it,3.0,,"This complex has many sections, consequently admission tickets are sold separately. This appears to be their attempt to keep the entrance fee affordable, if you only intend to visit part of it. However, not knowing what to expect, we end up purchasing all the tickets (except Snow City) and turns out to be quite expensive.

Science Centre:
Not worth visiting, most display exhibition are very old and have not been updated recently. The whole complex is missing its ‘vibrancy and life’. It has potential and the floor space, but being a science centre, it needs to be updated constantly to keep up with the times. Judging by the attendance on a weekend, it is losing its relevance unless a major update is undertaken. Also, to charge an additional $10 pp for each of the butterflies and Human Bodies interactive is expensive.

KidStop:
For parents with toddlers and preschoolers – the kidStop will be entertaining for the kids. It is an indoor playground with a Science Theme. So rather than the normal slides/swings, etc it has sandpit to ‘dig’ fossils, cockpit of an plane, doctor’s office, etc. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her time there.

The Omni-Theatre is an unique experience as it provides really wide screen (not just left and right, but also above your head) to provide images to your peripheral visions. So, it does feel that you are almost there in the movie, similar concept to IMAX. We watched the movie about the Dinosaurs, quite interesting and educational.

I would rate is a 5 for the kidStop and Omni-Theatre, but deduct 2 points for Science Centre.

HINTS:
Best seating for Omni-Theatre: middle top part of the hall, in the section with lesser seat count.
Purchasing Omni-Theatre and KidStop as a package saves $2 pp. Go during off-peak period where are savings to the admission charges. Off-peak is weekdays outside school holidays.
KidStop open from 9 am - 1.30pm AND reopen again after 2pm. Plan your timing properly for max value."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Worth a visit if you have teenager with you. They enjoy this more than any amusement park. Volunteers are very good and helpful. Human body tour is awesome
,,Some exhibits weren't functioning,3.0,,"A lot of the exhibits seemed a bit old and some no longer functioning. The shows were okay but not spectacular. It is quite a big place with a lot of potential, so they could have done better if more effort to refresh the exhibits."
,,Visit with kids,2.0,,"We have been there on a weekday. It was crowded with kids from various schools.
There are different exhibits: omni theater, snow city, human body & butterfly close up, & kids stop. We got all the tickets as they are sold separately.
The butterfly museum has absolutely no butterflies, and the kids stop only opened at 2pm. We went in early so we had no intentions to wait until 2pm.
We complained at guest services as no one has informed us on this. We got a refund back."
,,Not for toddlers,2.0,,"Went here with my 3 year old son. Many of the exhibits were not working or were under maintenance (e.g. the butterfly exhibit), which was not notified to visitors at the entrance. The ones which did work were mainly for 9-12 year olds and not suited for my young child.
Was off the track and a fair distance from the MRT and did not have a taxi stand which meant I had to ask visitor's service desk to call one.

Recommend going as a foreign visitor only if the weather is poor and you child is over 7."
,,Variety of Science Exhibits,4.0,,"This science center has a wide variety of exhibits indoor and out. Kids are sure having fun inside the museums.

However, it's a bit expensive if you want to see all the exhibits and 20 mins show. As certain area need to pay extra.

Although it is within walkable distance from SMRT (Singapore subway), the science center is located quite far away from city center. It takes an hour from Orchard Road station to there."
,,A perfect Edutainment Centre,5.0,,"A must place visit by all the school and college going students.as the science phenomena's are well explained.The best part of the center is where the functioning of human brain is explained in details and very pragmatically explained.

The best place for teachers to take out children for an educational tour."
,,"Fantastic exhibition, it is like a dream",5.0,,"Incredible: animatronic monsters up to 16 metres long. Prehistoric animals, modern ones, all so real! My son has so much loved it, and so have I. It is entertaining, well done, fascinating, educational. I warmly recommend it."
,,Fun & learning rolled into 1.....,4.0,,My 7+ year old thoroughly enjoyed the various interactive displays. The Tesla pyramid was a super-hit. Tad disappointed with the few non-working displays. Look forward to going back again next time we visit Singapore.
,,Average,3.0,,"I spent a few hours at the Science Centre with my young family (7 year old twins), the centre was ok but certainly not as good as I was expecting. The Human Body exhibition I do admit was excellent, the rest was well, so so. Usually when we have a family outing I have to drag my kids away but here it was them who asked if we could go.
Worth visiting once, unlikely we will return"
,,Fun and Educational,4.0,,Took our teenage kids who like science and they had a good time. Could have spent longer as it seemed to be never ending. Busy place but we'll set out. Some exhibits need a freshen up.
,,Butterfly exhibition,4.0,,Took my daughter here to have a look at the butterfly exhibition. It's a small section of the Science Centre but with a decent number of different butterflies. The rest of the Science Centre continues to be quite interesting. And not so busy on weekdays.
,,A must visit for children,5.0,,"A must visit for children, good for adults too . Well presented. Best if you can spare a full day to visit this place."
,,Science centre is worth the trip!!,5.0,,This time in Singapore we wanted to find some things outside of the tourist focus area. We caught a train to check out the Science Centre and weren't disappointed! What a great day out for the family with kids of all ages! There are so many fun interactive exhibits. During our visit they had a human body experience exhibit which you can crawl through the inside of a body and learn how each part works! Very educational and fun! The fire tornado show is definitely worth watching and happens twice a day. Some parts of the centre a little warn and could be updates but for the most part this was a winner with the kids and the adults!
,,Would love to have rated higher,2.0,,"Anything that is this educational and potential fun I would love to rate better. But the problem? Just too much out of order and not working. Seems to be lacking in care, attention and maintenance. Such a shame."
,,Good kids day out,4.0,,"We visited in June and it was a good family outing. The science centre is very interactive and the kids all enjoyed being able to test and play in each section. We watched two shows which were pitched at a good level for both adults and kids to enjoy. Very helpful staff. Admission price was very reasonable given the high quality experience. We arrived just after opening time, it was getting busy by the afternoon with school groups and tours so glad we came early."
,,Educational and fun,4.0,,Great educational and fun place for kids. Loved the Human Body exhibit though it is a temporary one and is closing soon. (Has a separate entry fee that covers you to experience the human body twice.) Many halls and exhibits. McDonald's is on site.
,,Fantastic! Not to be missed!,5.0,,"We (my husband, to boys 6 & 8 and my mum) visited here and it was simply fantastic. We went on the first Monday after schools went back and the place was nearly deserted. We literally had it to our selves. I guess this place would get busy at other times.
We were there soon after opening and stayed until it literally closed. Even then we didn't get a chance to see all of it. In fact, while I was elsewhere my husband returned with our two boys and found another large section we'd not even seen the first visit.
There are so many hands on exhibits that our boys were entertained for the whole time. We went through the human body section which was lots of fun but I believe a temporary exhibit. There was also plenty of information for adults. I especially liked the section upstairs on Russell Wallace, contemporary to Charles Darwin.
Honestly, I can't understand why this place wasn't packed as entry is very reasonably prices and it is fantastic. They even have a water play area and separate outdoor play place all based on scientific principles.
The only caveat is the food in the centre. There two little cafes. Both are very reasonably priced, but the food is pretty terrible and I'm not hard to please with food. The coffee was literally undrinkable. But it isn't a problem as there is a McDonalds restaurant at the entrance.
Pretty much the whole place is under cover and air conditioned. It is all wheelchair / stroller accessible. Although on our day the lift to the Wallace exhibit wasn't working so disappointingly mum couldn't see that. But that was just unlucky.
Do not miss this place, especially if you are travelling with children!"
,,An educational trip,4.0,,"Brought my 7 year old daughter there in June and it was a fruitful trip as she witnessed a fire tonardo show and also watched the 'Science with balloons' show at the auditorium. I must really commend the two ladies who have made the balloon show very interesting and entertaining for the kids and adults.

There were also other showcases such as talking about global warming and hands-on workshops like making periscope etc. There was a Math fair at the same time and she had the opportunity to be exposed to the wonders of Mathematics too. It was something new for us.

We didn't manage to cover the whole place as we only had about 2.5 hours there. I would suggest to spend at least half a day to slowly walk through the centre to discover the magic of Science.

Then again, I was quite disappointed that visitors have to buy separate tickets for other exhibitions. If only the tickets could be made more affordable, at least for the residents.

Anyway, do take note of the various show times in order not to miss them."
,,Our daughter went there with school and made us bring her again next day,4.0,,The Science Centre Singapore might very well need a renovation - but it is still an attraction worth visiting with kids. a Vast amount of experiments kids can do themselves as well as demonstrations you can watch - incl. a water play area which allows experiments too. Catering is nearby too. For kids between 5 to 12 a great day out - and quite frankly many of the things you can see and learn are fun for the parents too.
,,Informational and Fun Visit,4.0,,"We tried the Human Body Experience (HBX) and Laser Maze. The HBX is a bit expensive. It does offer a unique concept (e.g. entrance via a mouth) which makes it exciting for kids but the rest are just videos presenting information that you could have likewise gotten from the web. Some of the display are a bit dirty or smelly. It's not something I would try again.

As for Laser Maze, this is a fun experience. I would recommend this to both kids and adults. It is $5 per 2 runs per person. After finishing our 2 runs, we went back to the ticket booth to purchase additional tickets!

What I didn't like is that they had set up the Laser Maze inside the Science Centre, forcing you to purchase entrance tickets to the Science Centre before you can play this game. Makes it quite pricey overall."
,,family visit,3.0,,"We went here to get away from the heat outside for a change! Our daughter absolutely loved the interactive human exhibition where you climb into the mouth and explore the body, she did it four times, our younger daughter was scared stiff and wouldn't go near it! The centre has lots to do including a small butterfly dome and you can walk outside through the gardens. They have a nice shop as you leave with all sorts of fun stuff for kids."
,,It's been nice to revisit,5.0,,"It's been years since I've last visited the Science Centre, used to go when I was still in school and now, with my own kids. It's a short distance from Jurong East station, just walk towards J'cube and go behind the mall, walk past the small neighbourhood shops and come to a relatively busy intersection. The Science Centre will be diagonally opposite you (try spotting the sphere with 'Science Centre'. Cost $24 per adult and $20 child for an explorer pass which grants entry to the main exhibition as well as two other paying exhibition - we went for the Human Body Exhibition and Omni-theatre. There are loads to do and my kids were very entertained throughput our visit. The science with balloons demo was awesome. The two hosts had great camaraderie and spoke naturally. ..not like they are rattling off some memorised script. You will encounter some vidirirs trying to cut your lines at times but just graciously correct them, queuing up is a very natural act for Singaporeans. If you are not sure where the queue starts, just ask...u will definitely get your answer .cutting in limes are greatly frowned upon and considered an uncouth and selfish act. Anyway , we entered at 1.30 and left 5.30 after the omni theatre show. There are different timing for different shows. We went for 'Back to the moon for good' and I think the other shoe 'earth sun moon' would have been better. So my advice, go early and buy the Explorer pass.its worth it"
,,A must visit for kids as a tourist attraction,5.0,,"More than Sentosa Island, this place had many more exciting shows and activities to be had that any other place. My family spent the entire day and we still could not attend the Snow City or the Omni Theatre. Must watch attraction shows include the Tesla Coil show and the heat show, that captures our heat signatures in the camera. There was even a fun family adventure that was organized by the Science Centre that was exhilarating. The staff were very friendly and cooperative. I cant believe we were the only tourists out here. If you have more time to spend in Singapore, visit this place with your kids."
,,Interesting,3.0,,"Good place to take the kids on a rainy day. Presents science in an interesting light, even adults will learn things they didn't know.

Lots of interesting exhibits but by Singapore's normally high standards the maintenance here is a bit lacking. Lots of the exhibits don't work as they are meant to.

Still worth going. Most of it is a bit beyond those under 4. The water play area is very nice for the young ones though."
,,great place for kids,4.0,,"Visited this place last may, easy access by MRT and bus. My kids loved it, they can play and learn at the same time. we spend about 2,5 hours there...
they also have a food court inside, so you can grab a bite there near fire typhon exhibition. there is one small toy store near, but the storekeeper was rude. My kids watch and touch the toys there, children sometimes like to touch things especially when it was toys, but the storekeeper were mad and say that we don't have manner because of it. i meant they were just 6 and 7 years old kids."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"I loved it. Its very well done and very cool stuff on display - good for young and old ppl.
They have a whole education play area for kids which is absolutely great - my 2 year olds loved it too.
They have a water area which is very good for kids too."
,,If you love Science -Don't miss this!,5.0,,Very good place for kids and adults who like science. Exhibits are well maintained and pay attention to the presentation shows that they have. We attended the one by Tesla and it was so much a learning experience.
,,"Great experience, especially for kids",5.0,,"This is a relatively lesser known attraction in Singapore, but definitely worth the visit. Admission prices are very reasonable (SGD 12 adults, SGD 8 for children). They have a lot of interesting, interactive exhibits that are fun and educational. They also do shows at specific times, which are great. I especially loved the Tesla Coil Show."
,,A little further away from downtown but a good stop for families,4.0,,We spent about 2 hours there and had possibly went through 1/3 of the exhibits. Should plan for more than 3 + hours if you want to go thru the centre a bit more. If your family loves science centres that is possibly one that is up there. There was a wet play area so bring the wet gear. We enjoyed also the Omni theatre where the movie was narrated live. Although we didn't try the Chinese restaurant but was impressed that there was one at the centre in case everyone got sick of café food.
,,Feel like a kid,5.0,,I felt like a school kid.And again this is only for science lovers and for ppl who want to know the logic behind science.. Truely enjoyed it..
,,A centre full of enrichment activities and interaction!,4.0,,"Science Centre has to be one of the oldest attractions in Singapore and a place that many Singaporeans grew up learning about Science related subjects. Going back to Science Centre today has made me even more impressed by the never ending activities and knowledge that i re-learnt and improved. From the Centre of the Earth to Wallace's world and Ecogarden, this place deserved to be revisited by adults and children alike!"
,,Interesting place,3.0,,"I had visited this place as a kid and had loved it. It sure was interesting even after so many years as they have some new installations. Some things are very informative and fun.
If you are travelling with a kid they will spend a lot of time here and its very interactive for them. Its indoors and so the aircon helps when you visit the attraction. Not a lot of fooding options."
,,boring place,2.0,,initially i thought of cool stuffs and latest gadgets to be found there but it was lame things and people were crowding at macdonalds rather than visiting the place... lol
,,Learning path of scientific,3.0,,I give four start because I find that ticket some expensive and actually more of the activities was given for children. But that good for mine youngest Sister because she was quick like to learn. Just personal review. Sorry for any inconvenience
,,Will go again,5.0,,"We love this place, very interesting in science for both adults and children, entrance fee is just S$12, then you can stay to have a walk and absorb knowledge for a whole afternoon. Food stall can be found, no need to worry about it. In addition, a small water park for children, can bring the swim suit for them to play."
,,Very interesting and exciting even for adults,5.0,,"This place is great! It has so many exhibits including many interactive ones, plus interesting scheduled events. We spent many hours here, every one of us excited."
,,Excellent day out!,5.0,,"We spent a few hours at this amazing Science Centre. Plenty to do, fun for all and educational. The Centre is well set up with many interactive activities. My 14 year old loved it."
,,I am not a kid anymore ... but this really blew my mind,5.0,,"The facility is a little bit old, location is a little bit far away from the centre ... but besides that, I have to say this is one of the best experience I have in Singapore.

There are so many demonstrations and activities that bring back my childhood, being a science lover ... Every exhibition, every show, every details sparks.

It's hard to describe though text, but you got to go there, regardless of your age."
,,A world of exciting Science experiments,4.0,,"We went along as grandparents with our daughter and 9 year old grandson and all had a ball. There is just so much to see and do that one could spend hours in there if you had the time. We spent two hours, which wasn't really long enough, but gave us the time to try out a lot of the live exhibitions. My grandson thoroughly enjoyed himself running from one display to another.
By being there at opening it was not too crowded but by the time we were leaving the crowd had built up."
,,A must for children and adults!,5.0,,"There's something for everyone here! The human body experience is a must, kids can learn so much from this. The Maths section, the Tornado show, the Telsa coil, the heat show, endless possibilities. Places to eat and drink inside as well. I think more than a day is required in the science centre. Some exhibits are so cool! Even as an adult I enjoyed the experience"
,,It's not just for kids,5.0,,"I love science. But you should visit too because it taps your curiosity even if you are not a fan of science. A number of reviews has already spoken about the place. It is huge. Covers topics like electricity, sea, save earth, human body, aerodynamics, image, light... and more.

So I had allotted this place 4 hours and I so regret for doing that. Morning we went to Jurong Bird park and reached the science centre at around 2:15 PM. My family cursed me as they were tired and everyone hates museum. At the end , guess what ? They loved it and wished if we were there a little before.

Tips for visitors:
1. If you are interested to learn, reach there as early as possible.
2. You don't have much option to rest. So be prepared to walk a lot.
3. There are few on hands experiments conducted in the evening. Ask for it and reach the venue on time.
4. Human Body is another display. You need to buy a ticket to enter it. Buy it. totally worth it!
5. There are few experiments about love and brain. Very funny. Go read it.
6. Go and have fun, there is no age limit :)

How to reach there? I can't remember much details but there is a Bus stop right next to it."
,,This place was excellent,5.0,,"This place is a must for children not only will they learn but there are plenty of activities for them. We paid extra and entered the human body experience, we were a little unsure of it as we are both In our 50's and big but it was a good experience and very informative"
,,Great place to take the kids!,5.0,,"We went to see the Human Body Experience exhibit...which was great and highly informative! Much to my surprise, both my daughter and I didn't want to leave. So many great exhibits and activities to keep us busy! Great place for the family!"
,,Run to the Science Centre!,5.0,,"We visited the science center in March 2016, and our kids loved it! It has a ton of hands on activities for kids (and adults) to play with and learn through. The special exhibit- which has an additional fee- was The Human Body Experience. Climb in a six foot head, into the open mouth and slide down the esophagus for a learning adventure. I will say that the heart section uses strobe lights and is very loud- so be aware if you have any sensory issues. But it is a fun way to learn about the various systems in the body.
The museum has demonstrations during the day, which are very educational and thrilling.
Also, there is a splash park attached so bring the swimming gear. There was a small cafe as well.
Our kids did not want to leave. A must see for educational fun!"
,,Great science centre,4.0,,"My son didn't want to leave..amazing shows especially the SuperCool science show..tornado show..if u visit Jurong Bird park,it's very close. Do not miss it"
,,Awesome place loved it !!!!,5.0,,"Science Centre Singapore gives you ....a close encounter with the past prehistoric earth and flora fauna and habitat- dinasaurs, and next you can see the outer space in the planetarium...and have fun with talking robot, and so much more, go for rides to out space in a 3-d rooms, where one chairs moves, shakes....with the feeling that you travelling in space .....it was a awesome place highly recommened it !!!!!!!"
,,"see it, look it, show it uuuufffff",5.0,,"so many scientist for a day, water works, IZ hero, Defending Science, Bioethics, Climate Change- Challenge, Earth- Our Untamed Planet, Human body experience, Island Adventurer, Marine Alcove, E-mmersive, The Thinkering studio, Tuning In- Brain & Body, Invent, Quirky, Singapore Innovation, Atrium- Tesla Coil Show, Eco garden, Kinetic Garden and Courtyard"
,,Very Informative and Interesting,4.0,,"Snow city - Average, Snow slide is the only exciting one. Very small area Theatre - Average, The movie is not suitable for adults, more focussed towards children. Science Centre - Very Good. Every section is very interesting and informative."
,,Fun day for the boys,4.0,,"We went there with our friends and their kids so there were 3 boys - 1.5, 2 and 7. All the kids enjoyed themselves and were fascinated by the exhibits; the older boys (the dads) were also fascinated while the mums minded the boys. Overall fun day for the boys."
,,Enriching!!!,4.0,,"""Science Centre"", the name in itself bring goose bumps to one, in anticipation of seeing something unusual and out of the world...especially for someone like me who is not from the science background...and the Science Centre of Singapore truly lives upto those expectations in every sense...
Main attraction for me was experiencing the sky-diving simulator and virtual tour inside the human brain...both these experiences can't be expressed in words and were simply fantaboulous...they also do live workshops for kids wherein the centre staff assists the kids in designing a model or otherwise...they also do a live presentation based on some science theory....
I highly recommend the visit to this place, especially if you are touring with kids..."
,,Good Value,4.0,,Visited with my teenage daughter. It was not the most extensive science centres we have visited but it was an interesting 2 hours. A little out of the way so not many tourists
,,Monsters of the Sea LAME,2.0,,"Don't waste your money. Would have loved to see the rest of the science centre to see if there was anything worthwhile, but our over priced tickets only included the small, repetitive, uninspired single exhibit. Had asked at the outset whether the tickets included basic admission to the centre but there must have been some miscommunication... Poor signage and information at the entrance and throughout. Disappointing outing after a long trek to get there."
,,Fun and informative,5.0,,Kids are going to love this place which offers a lot of information about science and technology in a fun way. The exhibits are excellent and very carefully prepared and need a couple of hours to walk through.
,,Fun learning with visual effects,5.0,,"this is suitable for kids from the age of 9-10 with a basic understanding of science else they will only see at amusement IMHO.Adults can also enjoy if the have inclination for science.
there are numerous science effects and phenomenons explained in a effective ways throughout the centre.
the tickets are available on the counter at the entry point.
U can reach by the MRT very easily which is a 10 mins walk across the diagonally opposite mall.the bus stop is rigght infront if u wish to take bus from MRT station.

there are different shows for kids like Fire tornedo, tesla coil effects, the light effects show etc.it will be useful to get the show timing first and then plan to go around based these show timing
the experimental exhibits are spread accross u need to spend time on what enthuses you.
The Human body is one of the best i have seen rather the only one. this houses all the organs in huge sizes and expained thru an audio playing inside each chamber. this one is a must.
a good concept and well executed to make kids learn them in an easy way.
oh yes stollers (car shaped) avalable for your small kids to sit and enjoy when u walk thru"
,,Spend a day here,5.0,,A very interactive Science Centre usually with add on exhibitions which you can pay additional fees to see. Good place to take the family.
,,Good for kids,3.0,,"Nice place for kids, plan atleast 1/2 day, lots of exhibits. During my visit, Transformers exhibit was open and my kid enjoyed lot. iMax theater is also good experience."
,,"Monsters of the Sea exhibit is uninspired, disappointing and expensive",2.0,,"We took our 'crazy about dinosaurs' 4 year old to the Monsters of the Sea exhibit. The 4 adults in our family were disappointed with the wordy explanations, general noise level which made reading the signboards aloud difficult, lack of interactive activities and basic 'read and look' approach. There was almost nothing aimed at the pre-school crowd, and instead of an educational film we were offered Jurassic World. This fascinating subject was reduced to a boring wander through a repetitious, noisy maze. You let us down, Science Centre Singapore, and you charged us 'way too much."
,,Great experience,4.0,,"We went here mainly to visit an exhibition inside it called Human Body"". I suggest you visit it as its amazingly fun.

The centre itself is full of fun and knowledge. There are also certain sections where you can play with the exhibits to test your knowledge."
,,"Great interactive, enjoyable and educational day out.",5.0,,"You can really make it a full day outing. If it's a hot day you can bring the kids swimmers to enjoy the small water park. We particularly liked the human body exhibition where you slide down the throat, walk through parts of the body and come out as human excrement. Lotsa local mums n dads take their children there so you know that it's a worthwhile place to go to."
,,The kids have so much fun,4.0,,"We used tO go here years before. But because The kids now getting bigger and have a Lot of curiosity, so we Visit here again. We take a bus from our hotel tO Jurong East. IT takes a long way, almost An hour. But, after we arrived there, The kids are so excited because they have a Lot of scientific experience. But that's not all, because we also Visit monsters of The sea, that about everything in The sea. Anykind of fish and inside it."
,,Wonderful way to spend an afternoon,4.0,,"We've been to the Science Centre before and visited again this time around as my daughter was keen on seeing the 'Human Body' exhibit.

Given it's popularity and specially due to the water play area, the Centre is usually crowded and getting a ticket is a bit tedious. Budget on atleast a 15 minute wait.

What I like about the Science Centre is that each time we've been there, there has been something new to see. I personally love the 'hand's on' approach and this really pulls in the kids to learn more about science.

Try to catch the short demo on the Tesla coils and the Faraday cage.

Our main intention this time around was to visit the Human Body exhibit. While it appears a bit tacky it is a load of fun. Think of it as an interesting walk into someone's body. The entrance ticket permits you to do the walk twice and we liked it enough to go through it again.

Essentially, you enter physically through a mouth, slide down a gullet and go through the entire system only to exit through the expected orifice.

Beware though that some small children may find it a bit too much to take. There a bright flashing strobe lights, loud sounds (heart beats etc),you squeeze through tight spaces (such as the intestines) and there is a bridge that twists a bit and sprays you with water.

A lovely well designed exhibit that enhances the appeal of the Science Centre."
,,Family friendly activity,3.0,,This is a family friendly activity with heaps of interactive activities to keep the kids amused. Lots to see and lots to engage with to learn. Our only observation were parts of the floors and exhibits were tired looking and getting old. They can do with an update.
,,Worth a visit..Kids loved the science centre!,4.0,,"Singapore Science centre is worth a visit, particularly if you have kids! We've been to a few with our 5 kids and although it certainly not the best, it's worth a trip. Some parts are a little run down, but the shows are well done and the current attractions (new) are amazing. The current ""Inside the Human Body"" is an ingenious interactive walk-through in side the human body, beginning by crawling through the mouth and ending by climbing out the bottom. Fun for kids and adults alike you won't want to miss this one!"
,,It was fun and educational,4.0,,"My kids 8 and 10 years liked it. It was fun and educational. We only visited the ""Monsters of the sea"" due to time limitation. It took us around 2 hours including part of the movie. We were a bit disappointed about the movie, it was the Jurassic Park movie that we have seen already.

Admission fee for the family 2+2 was $72."
,,FAMILY DESTINATION,4.0,,"Do not be worried it's at all boring science, like at school, but real life causes and uses of Science that will help all in the family think and act to use science. What a fantastic place, children didn't want to leave the place.

Definitely a must-go and it gets updated every year."
,,Worth going back here again.,5.0,,Highly interactive place with different themes. Worth the whole day to go to. A wonderful educational experience.
,,Good Place for 5-12 year old kids,3.0,,"I visited the place with my 5.5 year old son. For Non citizens & Non PRs , tickets are bit expensive but I would say that its worth visiting atleast once for sheer experience of being there. Kids will definitely enjoy, especially the ICE section .

Keep a day for the visit as kids generally like to explore every bit of it . Scientific demonstration are good learnings for kids . I have been in Singapore for around 5 years , this was one thing somehow I missed and wanted to cover ,compare to other attractions in Singapore this is not something great with their own benchmark standards but still i would recommend kids to go there and spend a day to re-energize some scientific temperamants."
,,Keeps the kids busy,4.0,,"If you're from out of town and you're looking for a place to go with kids that is indoors and away from the typical touristy area, the Science Centre is a pretty good place to hang out.

There are lots of exhibits to see and play with, every time we visit there seems to be something new to see or do. During the school holidays they have some craft activities run by student volunteers, yesterday my kids made a periscope and a balancing butterfly.

It's educational and the kids get to see and touch and listen so many things. It's not very big, and 90% indoors (there is a large ecogarden and a water play area outside).

Usually there is a roving exhibition at the Annexe, currently it's the Monsters Of The Sea, which features GIANT animatronics of prehistoric marine creatures. A tad overpriced, if you ask me for an exhibit of moving statues.

The Human Body Experience (HBX) is pretty interesting as well, you get 'swallowed' into the body and go through the body. But it requires separate ticketing.

Next to the Science Centre is the OMNIMAX, where you can catch large screen movies ($14 for 30 mins...) and Kids Stop, a large indoor play area. My kids enjoyed it very much. Snow City in an indoor snow play area.

They have some ticket bundles esp for families but it can get a little expensive esp during the school holidays. Still, you'll get a full day out and you'll leave feeling quite accomplished :)

There are a few dining options there, including McDonalds. Coffee Bee has vegetarian options.

It's located in the far west, but can easily be accessed by cab or train. (A new hotel just opened nearby, under Resorts World). There are some nice big fancy malls there as well for shopping."
,,"Loads to do, discover & explore!",4.0,,Fantastic for kids with plenty to keep them entertained for a good few hours at least. Don't miss the additional exhibit at the back and the secret room for kids to climb into! Makes for a great day out for the family and even our kids grandfather found a nice and inexpensive massage chair to keep him relaxed :)
,,Lots to do here....,5.0,,"This is a great place for kids under twelve. You can literally spend all day here. It is deceptively huge inside with an amazing amount of exhibits. I recommend go there when they open at 10 am and stay there till 6 pm when they close. There is 3 eating option inside including a McDonald. However, the eating options at the Jurong East terminal area are enormous. Eat there if you enjoy Asian fares.

Pros

Huge number of exhibits with hands on activities
Planetarium type theater
Well maintained exhibits
Eating options with both Asian and western fares

Cons

It's a bit far from town...but museum is awesome"
,,good experience,5.0,,"you can never get bored here, there's always something interesting to learn and explore, even for children and adults."
,,Never to old to learn,4.0,,The exhibits at the Science Centre become interactive through the children and in turn through the fun and excitement they are having a positive catalyst for sewing the seed of science....
,,very interesting for a visit ..,3.0,,"its a very interesting and educational spot for young kids with several interactive exhibits .. otherwise, visit Snow CIty .. if you want to see snow in SIngapore :)"
,,Excellent museum,5.0,,"Whole the day in this center,there are many activities that children can do. Many experiments children can do."
,,Go once- or risk getting bored,2.0,,"I have been to the Science Centre many times. I must say that the first time I visited, I was blown away. The second time I had the same reaction. The third time a little diminished. Then, it just went downhill from there.
The problem is most of the exhibitions are (quite rightly) permanent ones. What this does is just make the entire place boring. I mean, how many time will I attempt to play with the (at the time of my latest visit) broken ball machine? How many times will I go and stand at the mouth of a long tunnel and play with echoes? In order to stay relevant, the centre must reinvent itself often.
In conclusion, if you are intending to visit the Science Centre, go ahead. But visit once. Otherwise, you will find the Centre gets boring...."
,,Umpteenth Visit,2.0,,"This Science Center blown me away when I first visited it 36 years ago. Since that time it has remained more or less the same. While an occasional new exhibit is refreshing, it has not improved much. I tend to compare it to the science museum in London so this place is lagging. But I last heard that a major revamp is coming. Hopefully not too little too late."
,,Educational and Fun,5.0,,"I spend my whole day here and I do not regret. I learned a lot, I must say mostly it is designed for kids (or family visits), but I still learned a lot. If you love science and have a few days in Singapore, than its defenetly worth of visiting,"
,,"Excellent, must have for kids. One of the best attractive places to go with young kids.",5.0,,"Excellent, must have for kids. One of the best attractive places to go with young kids. Very good experience, not expensive."
,,Makes learning fun for adults and children,5.0,,"A great place to visit with your family, especially if you have growing up kids. Lots of educational stuff explained in a fun way. We spent half a day at the Science museum and could have spent more. We combined it with the Snow city and the Omni Theatre, all of them amazing experiences. If you want to spend quality time with family and expose your kids to some fantastic learning stuff, this is the place to be."
,,Something slightly different,3.0,,Was entertaining and informative but is a little run down. Some exhibitions were closed for refurbishment. There were no guides to assist or explain things but the teenagers enjoyed anyway
,,A day is not enough for kids.,5.0,,This place is an initial foray in science for kids. The basic principles are well explained. It is difficult to cover all the sections in one day. The Human Body experience is a major attraction for kids. One should not miss the various shows during the day. Overall a good experience.
,,We can stay here all day!,5.0,,"Spent only an afternoon here with our 10 and 6-y/o. We regret not having seen everything due to the lack of time, but we thoroughly enjoyed what we did see. Be mindful of the show times so you can see them all.

If you want to go through the Human Body Experience, you need to get separate tickets at the entrance for an additional$15.

Science center is a must-visit especially for curious kids and kids who love interactive games while learning."
,,"Fun for kids, but too not high tech stuff for adults",3.0,,"The standard admission fee was very reasonable but in addition to that we had to pay separately for the 'human body experience' and the 'laser maze'. We went on a weekday and there were many theatres closed, many demonstrations not happening until the weekend, and an entire floor reserved for school students; we found too many exhibits with basic information rather than scientific facts for the educated audience. I guess it is a place to inspire children rather than to inform adults; but we expected much more technology and futuristic exhibits given that Singapore leads the way on so many technological and environmental protection fronts. Despite all it was an enjoyable day. It takes at least 4 hours to see all rooms. We recommend not to use the lifts or you'll miss out on the optical illusions displayed all the way up on the stairs."
,,Human Body Experience,5.0,,An amazing experience of walking through the body and interacting with differing organs. The revolving stomach was incredible.
,,a must see when travelling with kids,5.0,,"The Science Centre is an absolutely wonderful activity for children of all ages. we went with two kids (2 and 4 years old), who loved it. It is not necessary to visit the whole very extensive exhibition. The kids just loved to run around and try the experiments.
The food there is below average."
,,Fun but needs a little update.,4.0,,"The one thing that bothers me is the Einstein that has been going up and down that pole since I was in Primary school. But overall a fun visit, especially with the new brain exhibition."
,,A Step back in time..,3.0,,"I used to frequent the science centre as a kid as it was in close proximity to my house. Visiting now, it seems like nothing much has changed. I don't see much improvements anywhere at all. Food prices at the café still very expensive. Desperately needs a makeover."
,,Dated Science Centre,3.0,,"Wide range of hands on experience for children and adult to get close to science but the whole centre is dated and the cafeteria area is terrible, warm and full of oily smell. I recommend the whole centre should have an overhaul to catch up with time."
,,Amazing place worth a full day visit,4.0,,"Science Center in Singapore is a very interesting place to visit. It's a very big place with lots of things to see and to touch. It has several shows related to science which are very educative for children. My daughter loved the insect mania show very much. There are some eating places inside the premise so you don't have to go out looking for food/drinks. We went into a giant mouth in the HBX (human body experience). We went to the tornado simulator to experience tornado, then to the earthquake simulator. It also has waterworks where children can play and very clean changing rooms. Definitely worth the visit!"
,,Human Body Experience is good not great,4.0,,"Visited this attraction with my elderly parents, wife and 2 young kids.

Human body experience is not suitable for the elderly and very young kids as climbing into the mouth is required. My older kid (6 years old) was freaked out by the darkness in the body. LOL."
,,Human body experience rocks!,4.0,,"Queued 1 hr 10 min on mon 10 aug 2015 ffor thd above. Worth the queue but not for very young toddlers who started crying. You enter the mouth of a 3-d face into the gullet. You experience the lungs, then see the beating heart with huge red balls that resemble red blood cells. You also experience the brain, nerve cells, see a skeleton, cross section of a kidney, and exit thru the intestine and out thru the anus. Wonderful time spent! Also saw the art-chemistry show which was fun and filled with different chemical interactions."
,,Average place...need better maintenance,3.0,,"The place is showing it's age. Needs better maintenance. Many exhibits needs better presentation. For example, some of the explanation signs are in pitch darkness...how's anyone supposed to read? Can be a fun place for the children though."
,,"Too old, abandoned, obsolete",2.0,,"Many shows doesn't work and nobody told us about it BEFORE we have bought a ticket or through their web-site. Staff looks like non-professional and absent-minded.
Initial inertia is finished and now this center become just an worn out, obsolete monument to a former scientific development of Singapore. It's pity.
They even didn't made direction signs - how to reach the center from metro station."
,,2.5 yr old amazed!,4.0,,"School trip to science centre...

First I was a lil taken back as to what will a 2.5 yr old do there. But as it was a school excursion we did join them.

My toddler is a very active run around type. And the best thing- sci centre had a buggy car for u to strap your toddler. I was so happy n relieved. N my toddler loved to b in it as well.

My son really enjoyed the magic mirror, the metallic dancing mesh and the spark goin up etc.

Although he would understand a lot. But still he really had a good time looking at things."
,,A visit packed with learning and surprises,5.0,,"The science centre is never a disappointment.
Interactive displays and exhibits were everywhere. Every single display shows you something new. The place itself was quite big and is filled with many different areas of exploration.

A particular highlight of the visit was the Human body Experience. This exhibit is a way to get your kids to love Science more in school and to learn more about the processes and parts of the Human Body.

This is a very special exhibit where you can climb into the gigantic mouth of a human replica and experience the processes in the human body. You can even be swallowed alive with inflatables, life-sized interactive displays, strobe lighting and many more that would entertain and fascinate your kids.

This is a must-try exhibit! If yourself or your kids are fascinated by the human body, hate science, or want to learn more about the human body, this is the perfect experience for you! It is worth the money to most people!"
,,Highly entertaining kids museum!,4.0,,"Great attraction for kids of all ages. We particularly enjoyed the Human Body Experience Exhibit. This is a temporary exhibit which entails an additional charge. General admission is reasonable -- 12 SGD for adults and 8 SGD for kids. Singaporeans get a discount. Other highlights that we enjoyed on this trip: Fire-tornado Demonstration, Optical Illusions, the Brain Exhibit, and the Ecogarden. There's also an outdoor water-play area teeming with happy children. And a semi-outdoor area serves local food and snacks and drinks."
,,Great for kids!,4.0,,"I thought the Science Centre was a place for kids but I was wrong. There is definitely something for everyone. You could definitely spend a whole day here as there are so many halls holding so much information regarding different fields of science.

The exhibits are both interactive and entertaining and often use layman words instead of complicated jargon for easy understanding.

Admission is free (some exhibits require paid admission) for Singaporeans during off-peak. Off-peak days refer to weekdays during school term (excluding public holidays and school holidays).

However, if you are a tourist, I recommend you find alternative activities for your children as the Science Centre is located far from the centre of Singapore and may require many hours of your valuable vacation time."
,,Not what I was expecting,1.0,,I don't understand why it is call science center. The only thing close to science was deep see and how the cartoon movies get done. The entry to me is to expensive for what it is it cost S$40 they give you a coke voucher. However when I used it they only give me a hot coke eventhougth they had a fridge full of cool coke. At the end not very recommended. My pictures shows the most important moments inside. Not really good.
,,Fun for kids,4.0,,"Went with kids 7&9. Only went for a short time but could spend whole day there. Very hands on, lots of reading though. On tube line for Changi airport so a good way to fill time if flying out later on the day."
,,Excellent to take young kids,4.0,,Excellent for taking young children to learn basics of science. Good and interactive instruments for explanation.
,,Good for student,3.0,,"If you are on vacation and want to find attraction, you shouldn't come here. Because this place is meant for children to learn about science. Not for pleasure. It's quite bored."
,,Excellent museum,4.0,,"I went to the Science Center with my family and another family (2 12-year olds and a 10 year old). This place is an absolute gem - a host of well thought out exhibits that truly make science fun. The kids were entranced by various exhibits showing light effects, a stress measurement booth, an exhibit that measures beauty (!) and more. We attended a wonderful Tesla coil electricity show where the air literally crackles with electricity and a fire tornado show. All in all, the science was fabulous.

The only negative note was the food. There was a Macdonald's by the front - not a good sign - but the place I ate at inside the museum served some of the worst food I have had. I thought a peanut butter sandwich would be hard to mess up, but they succeeded in doing just that. I suggest you bring your own food!"
,,Great Day out for families,5.0,,"We were staying near Orchard Road and caught the MRT out to Jurong East. From here it was a short walk ( less than 1km ) although we initially walked the wrong way.
The centre was brilliant with a number of halls dedicated to various scientific endeavours ( sound, Brilliant interactive displays on Camouflage and military equipment ) and kept us occupied for most of the day. Get there early and see the Tesla Coil in operation. Definitely a great day out for all families with any interest in Science."
,,Remember for kids to bring swimsuit. Great place for children,5.0,,"So we had just come back from the London Science Centre which was world-class. The Science Centre in Singapore seems to be smaller and maybe the games are not as good for enquiring minds. But at the same time, it is amazing, highly recommended and so much to do within one day.
This is mainly for children and if you wanted to, could just bring the kids to the waterworks display and the children could play with water for hours while learning with wonderful things like levers etc - think its an excuse to have fun
The other good thing for young children would be the life cycle of a hatching chicken. They show what the hatching of an egg for 21 days - very nice for young kids.
Sundays are wonderful - there will not even one spare moment This is because once afternoon comes, there is a program every hour. There is the tesla coil in the centre of the Science Centre. Then there is the fire coil which is in the middle of the courtyard. There is also a scientific workshop where they do these fantastic demonstration with liquid nitrogen - to show about solids & liquids.
There are also temporary exhibitions like the human body and the brain which are exceptionally good.
With all these events, there sees to be hardly any time for the other permanent exhibitions.
Would say the Science Centre is more suited for children though and less so for adults. Also lunch choices here are not that great."
,,Science at its best,5.0,,Great attraction... Must say one of the best.... Plan to spend at least half a day here.... Certainly one attraction in Singapore that is not to be missed
,,Awsome,4.0,,The best part is they got tesla coil in display. the kids can exercise some science there. they have great exhibition so catch.
,,Edutainment for everyone,4.0,,the exhibition was interesting. i'm 30ish and still could enjoy my time there. the presentation was fun though i sometimes couldn't understand everything but the staff was kind and helpful with the guests. I would recommend my friends to visit there.
,,A must for the families with kid,5.0,,"This centre is a must for the families with young kids . On a rainy day or on a holiday make it on the priority list . The mind blowing science centre teaches the young kids about the simple way to of application to the sciences in practical life . With hands on experiments kids learn and have fun at the same time ,"
,,Very educational experience,5.0,,"A must visit everyone . Science centre offers an amazing experience and opportunity to see, experience and learn various amazing facts of science. The marvels and wonders of science comes alive with hundreds of displays and working models. Do it yourself class was the best as children could do experiments on their own with the guidance of the instructors. The activities conducted from time to time such as 'fire tornado"" , were excellent. Even the food on sale was delectable and quite affordable."
,,Good For Children Education,3.0,,"When you have a time in Singapore, you can go to this Science Centre, but you must bring your families, especially your children. It is quite interesting for children and for me, the Singapore Historical Museum next to the Science Centre is more interesting.
Anyway, worth of visit, and you can reach there by MRT."
,,Nice house to science experiments and unique exhibitions,4.0,,Great place to have a day of fun with kids. They do have special exhibitions every now and then. It's really fun if your kids are above 4 years old as they can understand the complex science better.
,,A great day out,5.0,,A great place to spend the day with young kids - just don't forget to take their swimming gear as the water exploration area is too fun to miss out on. Our kids 4&6 had a blast exploring all the different areas & enjoyed ending the day relaxing in the amazing Omnitheatre. They would have played in the free outside gardens for ages longer too if we'd had more time.
,,equipment are worn out,3.0,,it is a good place for kids and toddlers to go but for an adult its not worth the trip as it is out of the way from the city center and some the equipment are worn out/not working. ( some of the section are also under maintenance and some of them just show pictures and description)
,,Full day out,5.0,,"Heaps of things for kids to do, plenty of interactive activities. Definitely worth spending the money and be prepared to stay the whole day. Kids wont want to leave"
,,Kidstop Centre: good fun but pricey and a bit dated,3.0,,"This is the the first role play centre we have taken our kids to. They thoroughly enjoyed themselves. However, I felt that the entrance fee was pricey for what you get. Equipment was a bit old. We went on Monday morning but as it was school holidays, there were quite a lot of children there. Some things were cleared away efficiently; mostly dependent on which staff was on duty in that area. Some staff were attentive whilst some were happy to chat to each other or check their phones, hence areas in their care tended to be messier as they were slow to help tidy up. Would be good to have an attendant at the Small World area, where there were big bricks for 0-3years old. As there was no one supervising, bigger kids went in to play and was not always gentle with the younger ones."
,,Fun with science,4.0,,"It's quite far from the city center, you need to stop at Jurong East station if you go there by MRT. Then 5-10 minutes walk to The Science Center. We went there in the morning and spent the whole day, and even then we couldn't explore the entire attractions/sections/departments. It's really big! Highly recommended, especially for young children."
,,"Human Body Exh is excellent, but that's basically all that we go there for.",3.0,,"The center itself is mostly very old fashioned.

One part that is worthwhile is the Human Body Exhibition, for which we return over and over again: the kids absolutely love it, and on my part it is time well-spent.
The entrance ticket to the exh allows you to enter it twice, which comes in very handy. since the first time in, you get to enjoy it as a whole and to appreciate the concept. The second round you can allow more attention to the individual sections inside the exh.

Snow city is a bit poor: thin layers of ice chips. small space. Possibly give it a pass, and anyway avoid on weekends and PH.

The iMax ""Back to the Moon"" is basically a 20 minute Google commercial. Save your time, money, and above all - your children's attention.
The animal iMax (sorry, forgot the name) is nice.

There is an on-site McDonald's and a decent waterworks area. That makes up a very nice half-day out:
start off with Lunch at McDonald's, then the Human body Exh - allow quite some time for that, some amount of time in the museum itself, and lastly when the sun is no longer blistering - the waterworks area."
,,Learn Fun Science,5.0,,"This is the best Science Center I have ever visit. Everything Science is here. I want to bring all my students and learn everything inside. I took one full day to totally enjoy and experience everything inside. and I think still not enough, its too big and much learning is waiting. My favorite is the math logic area where I solve a lot of logical problems. so much learning and fun :)"
,,Awesome,5.0,,Awesome place to visit All about science!! Such a great things to do at singapore I recommend you to go with your friends ! :D Not really expensive and I liked it.. A lot hahaha
,,Lots to do for kids (and adults too),4.0,,"The science centre is a bit out of town, but easy to reach by MRT. It's a big place and there's lots to see,do and learn for kids. My kids (age 4-9) liked it a lot and you can easily spend a whole day here if you want to do everything."
,,Very educational,4.0,,"The place is nice but exhibits outside are a bit worn out. Overall, this place is very educational. To go to this place, you can alight at Jurong East station and take the bus."
,,Very Educational,5.0,,And fun too! It's all worth it. Try to see and interact with all the displays. You'll have fun and learn at the same time.
,,excellent,5.0,,"could have spent a whole day at the centre. so much to see and do, we were there quite a while and still didn't see everything don,t miss this attraction if you have children with you"
,,"Pretty good but, can be so much better",3.0,,"My family and I visited the Science centre recently. Although it is pretty good, they can make some minor changes to make it so much better. First of all, we had to queue for approximately 45 minutes to purchase tickets. This was bad enough however; while we were visiting, the Human body experience (HBX) was going on and it was not until we wanted to walk through that we were informed we needed an additional ticket. We were never told this when we purchased our tickets so; I was forced to go back and wait in the queue again to purchase the additional tickets. Very frustrating! In addition, so many of the exhibits don't work. It is a shame because if they were working, the experience would be so much better. This is pretty poor when people are being charged admission only to find that many things don't work."
,,Awesome place,4.0,,We were one of the first few to arrive and my boys spent the whole day exploring and trying everything. It's great that there are school students who volunteer and coach my kids to try the many experiments there and there are shows too. Great way to get the kids to love and explore science and it's many wonders
,,Mixed Feelings,3.0,,"There's not much to say. There are all these activities which Kids can do however I think most of it will appeal to older kids. I waited until now to visit as my son will be turning 5, but I think I should have waited some more. He did find a few things interesting, but not everything ! Nothing against the attraction though. Will wait a few years before visiting again."
,,Scientists' World,5.0,,"And once you get to the Marina Bay Sands, don’t forget to drop by the ArtScience Museum that showcases major international touring exhibits from the most renowned collections in the world. Moreover, there’s also a mesmerizing light and fountain show to entertain the tourists for free every night!"
,,Easy way to spend 3 hours !,4.0,,Visited with 3 young teenagers. All loved the centre and spent a very interesting and educational afternoon here. Great section on climate change. Omni theatre was closed during our visit but human body exhibit was very good. Pre order if travelling by taxi as the wait can be lengthy when finished your visit. Limited food options on site. Recommend.
,,very fun,4.0,,I brought my kids visited to Science Center many years ago. We love the very fun science games at different exhibition hall. Educational for children and informative for adults.
,,"Great place for educational, good for your child(ren)",5.0,,"Instead of Universal Studio Singapore, it's good idea if you bring your kid(s) into this place. This place has many educational and interactive inventions such as: mini tornado, robotics, Tesla wires etc. Last years ago when we visited this place, they have Jurassic theme and they have robot of T-Rex, Brontosaurus and Triceratops. They also provide some history and explanation for each display so it's good if you want to learn anything from its.

On the outside area, they have children playground.

The cleanliness of this place will be my plus score :)"
,,Education and Entertainment all rolled into one!,5.0,,"My children almost suffered from information overload in the Science Centre, but the way the Centre combined entertainment and education made the experience a memorable one not just for them but also for this happy daddy.

I was blown away by how theme after theme were all very well planned and how the slightest attention to every information and play nugget was thorough. The places to eat were also not bad for a stand-alone activity center.

I really wish every major city would have a place like this, not just something haphazardly thought of and just labelled a science center like the one in my home city."
,,Great for families,3.0,,Wow what an awesome place this would be for families with kids. Heaps to see do and touch. Right near the Snow City real snow and ice experience. Last thing I wanted to do after the heat outside was to put on snow gear!
,,Interactive & educational,4.0,,"A very nice and wonderful experience for both children & families. Plenty of educational & interactive games to keep a high engagement level.. and at the same time, plenty of knowledge to take home. Educational while having loads of fun. Definitely something worth visiting when in Singapore. Only hassle was trying to flag a taxi as it took us a good 20 minutes before we managed to flag one."
,,Educational place,4.0,,"Am a local here,so I've been here many a times wid my kids..I normally.go.there in e mornings n my.kids head strait to.the water play area..
Bring ur own towel..toilet nearby to change, comes with a hair dryer too..
Lunch is good with local fare like chicken curry n lamb chops.. N there is a huge Mac Donalds too at e premises, which is a big hit!
A full noon n evening is needed to explore e many science exhibitions.. My 3yr old enjoyed tinkering n pressing the buttons n stuff for various exhibits..
Overall, a full day will b needed to go thru everytin.."
,,Must watch for Families for kids,5.0,,"It is an excellent place for families for kids, they can learn lot of things like - Solar System, Mirror effects, Light and sound effects. This place offers small area for water play area for kids."
,,Human body experience still worth a visit and recommended,4.0,,"Visited the human body experience for the second time. Kids has been wanting to come back since we visited Singapore last year. Less crowded in the ""tract""because it is now not part of the admission fee. The exit part(large intestine and rectum) has improved. It also has a limit of 2 tries as well. Would be better if it is priced slightly cheaper."
,,Interactive Experience,4.0,,"Opted for the 3 in 1 package - Science Centre, Human Body Experience and the Omnitheatre.

1) Science Centre
I've not been to the Science Centre since I was a kid, so was amazed at how much its changed. There's lots more exhibits that are experiential eg. a tornado and earthquake.I quite liked the marine cove exhibit too. However as I went on Saturday, the place is too packed with children which is a bit distractiing for me to focus on the information. I would allocate 2 -3 hours to really take in the exhibits.

2) Human Body Experience
Interesting and clearly targeted for kids as you had to climb, slide down, and navigate through some narrow spaces. At one point of the exhibit, I got injured in the 'heart chamber' when one of the balls stimulating the bouncing blood cells hit me in the face as I was taking a photo. Please note that the place is dark so you really have to be extra alert throughout the entire journey. You definitely need to be mobile to navigate through this exhibition.

3) Omnitheatre
Chose the Great White Shark documentary which was really interesting and I came away learning quite a bit. The domed part is quite an interesting way to screen the shows, and they have a good surround system. Each show is about 40 minutes."
,,Reasonable value,3.0,,Generally a good way to spend time with 5-13 year olds however many exhibitions (20-30%) are out of order or broken. Shame this isn't kept up to scratch as it had potential to be very good.
,,Science for everyone!,5.0,,"You might have been to many science centres and this is above all. As it was near to where i was staying in Jurong, i planned to go for a visit and spent 3-4 hours here understanding everybit of structures and science behind it which also makes you feels like a magic. Also there is first ever dome theater in this science centre and i had a great time here. Single, Family and friends all can enjoy and learn at the same time. nothing to get bored here."
,,Great Experience,5.0,,I had one of the best experience about knowing science and how it works including the attractions in there like the: Shows Heartbeat Attraction
,,Great,5.0,,"We spent about 4 hours here, but you could quite easily spend much longer. The price of admission is quite reasonable and the shows that they put on throughout the day are great."
,,A MUST FOR YOUNG CHILDREN,5.0,,"Designed for children 18 months to 8 years this is a real winner.
We took our 3-year old to the KidsZone and after nearly 3 hours had great difficulty in getting him to leave. So many hands-on things to enjoy. Unfortunately we had no time left to see the rest of the centre!"
,,Ok ok lah,3.0,,Everything in the science centre was ok-good.But one thing I want to complain is about the human body exhibition.you may think it may be fun-ya its kind of fun but they have a very weird plastic smell that is awful.i can smell it when I go through the slide.
,,Good place to spend at least half day with kids,4.0,,"A good mix of activities of different nature (education, fun …) for kids of different age. The mini water park is within the complex and my son enjoyed it a lot. The entrance fee is quite high but it is easy to spend half a day there."
,,Great place to visit for all ages,4.0,,"Visited here during our recent trip to singapore, and was glad we did.
So much to look at and plenty of interactive activities to keep you occupied.
We purchased a combo ticket that included the IMAX cinema and Snow City.( we did not like Snow City').

For travellers from Perth that have been to Sci-Tec this place is simular to that, but so much better.

When your ready to leave visit the guest relations office and ask them to book a taxi for you, as we were unable to get one from the street."
,,Exploration & Discover for All Ages,4.0,,"I am constantly in awe of the never-ending things I can learn there. I would think any age groups of people would enjoy the visit if they have an inquisitive mind. Take your time to explore the area, there is much to learn if you know how they work.

Bring your little ones to excite and open up their eyes to the World of Science. From the moment one passes through the entry, you will be greeted by the illusions, optical illusions that will make you doubt your eyes and provoke your mind. Some tricks are easily seen through if one has the basic scientific concepts, otherwise, a great place to pose questions for the little ones to explore on their own. There are many topics being introduced, from forces, cells, robotics, body systems, everything about plants, life cycles and the outdoor garden where you can examine different plants, shrubs and get to learn their names, the fruits, flowers etc. On the second floor, one can explore the solar system. One can also get some hands-on activities. There is also the kinetic garden located outside near MacDonald's and water works whereby children can have fun playing the water games.

What else?
Bring plenty of water because you would be tired out, stay hydrated. Eat at designated area and observe a respectful etiquette for the items on display. I was rather disappointed when some parents allow their children to run amok, screaming their heads off and handling the things roughly or touching it with their food-filled hands - these inconvenienced and deprived others of chances to use it.

Avoid hogging. See it, touch it, try it then let others have a chance. I was once in a situation waiting for my turn to play and a child was hogging it relentlessly while the parents watched on. Give others a chance too, we paid as well.

Time: Do start early so you have ample time to explore all the zones."
,,Not that great,3.0,,I went there with high expectation.... But this is not at all up to the mark... I went for the mummy show.... But disappointed with the overall experience...
,,Interesting for adults and children,5.0,,"We visit it every few years, and each time are amazed at how much we learn. So many of these places seem only for children, but here many of the exhibits are intended for adults.
There’s a real danger when you enter. There’s a fascinating display of optical illusions. It’s easy to spend ages looking at them. Try to get through them to the Atrium, to see all the other things on offer in the centre.
This time we spent our day in just 2 of the galleries, the exhibition on the human brain, and the other about Wallace, who developed the theory of evolution independently from Darwin while visiting South East Asia.
Both exhibitions were fascinating, and included multimedia presentations. Unfortunately the Brain exhibition gave no chance at all to sit down, making it tiring. We were even expected to stand for a 9 minute video. By contrast in the Wallace display both videos had ample seating.
We also enjoyed a film in the Imax theatre. The screen is domed, it gives a very intense experience but does distort the picture towards the edges. However the film on Lemurs was fascinating, especially after seeing them at the Zoo. It makes a nice change of pace, and the films are worth the fairly high cost.
There are plenty of toilets, all very clean. We used the cafe in the centre, the Coffee Hive for lunch. We had fish and chips, all freshly cooked and very tasty.
If you come by MRT to Jurong East, look for the wide path to the right of J Cube (the mall). It leads directly to the Science Centre. Along it, look for an interesting display about the history of Jurong.
All visitors should spend time at the Science Centre. We always find it fascinating, and it helps us understand why Singapore is doing so well. We spend most of a day here, then often visit the Chinese Garden to relax."
,,no graffiti or trash,4.0,,"Singapore is one fantastic city. We bought a 3 day pass and took the buses and trains everywhere. Don't buy it at home, very hard to find pick up place, buy your pass at the train station.--- The airport is new and you walk !! , public transportation stops at midnight, so only private Co.( Price ok, depends where you are staying and they wait to get as many as possible to go and take everybody to their hotels) or taxis $$$. We took the river cruise, a must. The flyer is ok. but we spend the money for the ride to the top of the towers and had a coffee. Get a map, it helps to see the bus stops etc."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,This was a little disappointing for us as we booked it to see the transformers exhibition. When we tried to enter the exhibition we were told there's an additional charge of $30 per person. My husband was happy to pay it but I wouldn't out of principal. Not a great deal for adults to do in the centre. More geared towards children. They have a good small water park area. Just disappointed with the transformers expedition.
,,Transformer Exhibition - Complete Time and Money Waster,2.0,,"At $30 per person, this exhibition is a joke. The exhibits are limited and the quality is inferior. They even have to borrow minature exhibits from local hobby collectors to form part of the exhibition. You could finish this place in just 1 hour unless you want to queue up for the meet and greet session or watch the free movie. Whoever in Science Center makes the decision to bring in this exhibition, please do not do it again. It is a disgrace to Science Center. I felt totally cheated at the end of the tour."
,,Average place,3.0,,"i was not sure to go or no after reading some reviews here but later i decided to go
and i think if i had to choose again i wouldn't make the same choice again !

it was far from my hotel ( marina bay sands )
the place was okay for little kids but nothing that interesting for adults i spent around 2 hours in the place .
- need to be organised in more better way !

* important tip : if you are using a taxi for a transportation make sure that you order one ahead before you finish as there is no available Taxi's in the place and i had to walk long time to find a taxi stand !

- Not recommended for Adults"
,,Transformers exhibition,1.0,,Incredibly expensive for what it is. Only interesting part is a laser maze for which you have to queue at least 30 mins inside.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This is amazing!!! Way better than I expected. We went though the human body experience and what an experience it was; super fun. Web on weekday so it wasn't busy, and saw a fire tornado.
Would recommend heading there early, because there are lots shows and stuff for kids to do.
All exhibitions were just great and we had a great time. Definitely recommend."
,,good for kids,3.0,,"We had a short visit here as we were nearby and was included in a 3 day pass that we prepurchased.Lots of hands on stuff for understanding and learning etc.Anyone over 25 , as we are would find it a bit ho hum.Cheap snacks in house plus Maccas at the door.There are no taxi ranks outside.However, just cross the 6 lane road to theCube centre, around 6 minutes walk.You can see the mall from the centre.Theres a taxi stand there.kids would enjoy tbis place."
,,disappointing,2.0,,"there are a vast number of exhibits here to look at and touch, and we were looking forward to it - by far the biggest science centre that we have seen.
However, many of the better looking exhibits just didn't work. Most did not have signs on them, so it would take a while to work out that something was missing or broken.
Definitely better for younger kids, as they are more forgiving.
A very good concept, but money needs to be spent on maintenance."
,,Interactive fun for 5 - 10yo,4.0,,This is similar to Questacon in Australia with a variety of hands-out science exhibits allowing children to touch and learn. The water play area as a major draw for a child but careful as the asphalt flooring really heats up in the sun.
,,Great hands on activites,4.0,,"If coming via the mtr, it is a 5 minute walk, it is not signposted from the station, so proceed towards the library or the shopping centre. My daughter enjoyed her time there, but not all exhibits were working. She made a great toy with the assistance of a secondary school student who was manning "" be a scientist for a day"" section."
,,Learn science in fun way,4.0,,Science center give science experience more fun. But please make sure your kid already know a little about science. Snow city and this area could be rate as poor. The chamber are to small.
,,wish I read reviews BEFORE buying tickets,1.0,,"Sadly everyone is right - the Transformers exhibit is a blatant advertorial for the movies. While they attempt to put some ""history"" of the Transformers into it, the exhibits were really lame. The biggest draw is a laser show (think Entrapment) and showtimes for the movie (yeah, the Hollywood one, not some cool retro Japanese one). The tickets are pricey and we've been to much more interactive and fun exhibits here before. They even hand you a little quiz sheet to do while you're going through the exhibit but there is no prize at the end or reason for doing it....kind of theme of the entire exhibit."
,,Avoid Transformers!,1.0,,"The Transformers exhibit is an absolute waste of money and time and you really should NOT go there! Our family of 2 adults and 4 kids (6, 7, 12, 16) were utterly disappointed and have to say it is REALLY expensive too! We felt totally ripped off. There is nothing to do, nothing to see, there is no ""interactive and hands-on"" features as in the brochure, really nothing."
,,Best science centre we've seen,5.0,,"The Singapore Science Centre is very well organised, has loads of exhibits and interactive activities, video/audio information and plenty to keep adults and kids educated, entertained and happy. The fire tornado was very cool (um, hot) as well.

The Human Body Experience (HBX) was fantastic! You climb through the mouth of a massive human head and slide right into the start of the several human body systems. There's breathing, moving lungs; vocal chords with differing tones; a beating heart; coloured blood vessels and neurons in the brain to explore, along with informative video commentary at most stations. At $60SD for 2 Adults, 2 kids (for the science centre and the HBX), it was good value and you can easily make a day of this place."
,,The Teenagers liked it.....but it didn't interest me,3.0,,"My 3 teenagers really liked it, but they are all intellectuals! LOL! There were some good things to see,soo real it was a good place. Lots of school excursions whilst we were there...."
,,Would have been good in years gone by,3.0,,"I think the science centre would have been great a few years ago, but on our visit many things just didn't work the way they should or had parts missing. Think it's a great idea and would love to visit again if it was updated.
We mainly went to see the Transformers exhibition which my daughter / husband loved, I thought it was a bit overpriced.
A reasonable day out, but I wouldn't put it in your top 'must do' list."
,,Avoid the Transformers exhibit at all costs,1.0,,"To any Board members at the Science Center who are listening out there, the Transformers exhibit is an unconscionable waste of money and an insult to the memory of Dr Toh. It does nothing but devalue the Science Center's reputation.

The Science center itself is wonderful and many of the exhibits such as the dinosaurs exhibit and the human body exhibit are much loved, educational and thoughtful.

The Transformers exhibit however, is an absolutely horrendous, cynical money making exercise designed to sell toys. It cost us $180 for two families to go and we were finished in 10 minutes and the children were miserable.

There is virtually nothing for children in there.

There are adult collectibles on display in glass boxes. Giant plastic statues of transformers that don't move and two screenings per day of ""Transformers 2"" from 2009.

This movie is rated PG13 and starts with US solidiers led by Optimus Prime, assassinating two
""evil"" terrorist robots who weren't doing anything wrong other than hiding from their assailants.

There is a dark room with laser pointers in it, which they are calling ""a laser maze"" and tables for children to colour in on, at additional cost."
,,The Transformers Exhibit is a complete rip off,1.0,,"After returning from a recent visit to the Transformers exhibit I cannot believe that the Science Centre would associate their good name with this joke of an exhibit. Our group of 4 adults and 4 kids (ages ranging 4-8yrs old) made the biggest mistake visiting this place on our recent visit to Singapore. After spending $180 the kids were too scared to watch the screening of Transformers 2 which is not age appropriate for even our 8 year old, there was no rides unless you count the laser maze and the transformer figures had buttons to press which didn't even work. To add insult to injury the arts and craft section wanted parents to pays another $20 on top of the exorbitant entry fees so your kids could make a robot with playdoh.
We entered the movie screening and walked out when we realized they were just playing a DVD of Transformers 2 and spent less than 5 minutes taking a couple of photos! What a rip off! We could have spent all that money on toys for the kids.
My 6 year old came up to me when we left and said "" Sorry mummy for wasting your money"".

If you had a similar experience, you can provide feedback to feedback@science.edu.sg"
,,Transformer,2.0,,"The center is kind of run down, nothing much to explore. Especially Transformer exhibit not worth for the price, nothing much to view, kids are disappointed."
,,Transformer Exhibition a complete rip-off and total embarrassment for the Science Center,1.0,,"We have always enjoyed visiting the Science Center every few years. The exhibits are slightly dated but remain as a educational and fun place for the family.

The Transformer exhibition, however, is a complete rip-off and this should be an absolute embarrassment for the Science Center management. There is zero education value, a lack of exhibits, a continuous movie screening of a show that many had watched, and at $30 for adults, $24 for kids, it had left an awful taste in our mouths. The Science Center shd be concentrating on educational exhibitions and not attempting to rip people off by putting a few commercial props meant for cinema foyers and amusement parks. The Science Center shd not be mimicking Universal Studios."
,,What a mind-boggling rip-off: Transformers 30th Anniversary Exhibit,1.0,,"Its still a mystery to me why this Transformers Exhibit was held at the Singapore Science Center -- it has as much to do about Science as Desperate Housewives has to do with child upbringing. At least in Macau they had to the good sense to hold this at an entertainment/gambling venue. Is it not a little confusing to bring kids to a place named ""Science Center"" while displaying a load of fiction ?

At 110 SGD for a family of 5, this was daylight robbery. We weren't really expecting any educational value from this venue but some theme towards education should at least have been attempted. The exhibition was primarily Transformers mannequins/statues. They had a shameless screening of one of the episodes of Transformers in there (2 hour screening) and some laser tag game (what that has to do with Transformers or Science beats me) with an impossibly long queue.

I guess this exhibition will draw fans -- and more power to them. My main disappointment with this is where its held, co-opting an educational venue to promote pure hooey which has nothing to do with science, and all about blatent pushing of franchise merchandise.

The support staff weren't very attentive of informed. When we asked about where certain things were (Toilets, Screening theatre, etc.) almost everyone gave us a blank stare or the wrong answer.

One wonders what the next exhibit might be held at the Singapore Science Center .. Commicon 2015 ?

Unless you're fanatic about Transformers (and even if you half decently like the series), give this a miss."
,,Fun Education for all the family,4.0,,"Holidaying in Singapore our family of three generations spent a rainy day visiting the Science Centre. We had great fun trying out the interactive displays, especially the Human Body Experience. After stepping into the mouth of a 6m tall ""human face"" and sliding down the throat we learned about the five main systems of the body. The journey lets you interact with and explore various parts of the body and see how they function, complete with lights and sound effects."
,,One Stop Education!,4.0,,"If you travelling with children, don't forget to spend your time here.
Education is an exciting topics and we can learn science in fun and unique way...even adults will enjoy this place...Just take MRT to Jurong station and take a bus number 66 to Science Center..."
,,Great entertainment for kids,4.0,,We came here earlier in the year with our daughter for a quick visit. Plenty of interesting exhibits and I think we may well visit again very soon. If I recall correctly the prices were also quite reasonable.
,,30th anniversary Transformers Exhibition will transform you to be a wiser person,1.0,,"Went with my family ages between 8 to 70 year old. For the twenty minutes we were there, we all felt like 3 years old all over again, because only at the age of 3 would you be gullible enough to fall for this ""exhibit"" where the robots don't move and the badly done projection show based off of the1980's cartoon prompted my 8-year old to turn to face me and mouthed ""daddy, we had been had"".

The three ""interactive"" powerpoints at the entrance were easily hacked as you can touch the lower-left corner of the screen to activate paint brush mode and paint over whatever graphics they had on there, the ""toys"" in the glass cabinets weren't what you couldn't see in a large toy shop, the ""activities"" (two of the three required additional $ to even allow you a chance to touch the recycle carton boxes and recycled PC motherboards to build cardboard transformer out of stencil and ""scrap metal transformer"" junks).

This was such a blatant ripoff that left a bad taste and sour my mood for the rest of the day.

Save your money and go to toys r us instead and you would have a much more rewarding experience. With the $120 saved you could get a couple of large transformer action toys there that would be more worth while. Alternatively, spend more and go to Universal Studio instead if you really crave that transformer experience.

This ""exhibit"" was a transformative event that transformed my family into a bickering group for the next hours that finger point each other in an attempt to find who was the culprit that wanted to go there in the first place. In the end we were all better at making excuses and learnt a valuable lesson. Sadly we did not get our money back."
,,Con job,1.0,,"Over price, nothing impressive. So disappointed and a waste of time. Tier pricing between residents and non is unfair and uncalled."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Went because my kids were missing school for a visa run. They had a special exhibit on the human body which one of my sons was studying. It was really awesome until they had to enter through a mouth. Was a funny experience to remember for us. HA! But overall so good, so much to see and learn. Our 3 boys ages 3, 6 and 10 all loved it and us adults did too. At the end they made a fire tornado and the kids were so amazed! Education and fun all in one, can't beat that!"
,,One day turned into teo,5.0,,We thought we were going to the science museum but had been given directions to science centre. Best mistake ever. We spent one full happy day exploring and hadn't left the first floor. Came back the next day to do more and still left some unseen. The exhibits are interesting and very interactive plus the shows at various intervals were well run and informative for all ages
,,Visit to the Transformer Exhibition,3.0,,"An overrated and over priced exhibition thats not worth visiting at all. Luckily we bought the science centre package which is so much more interesting.

Apart from seeing life size transformers thats nothing much in the exhibition an its definitely over priced! Even the most enthusiastic transformer fan will find this exhibition overrated by media.

Strongly recommend visitors to go for the science centre and imax package instead."
,,"""Edutainment"" Centre",4.0,,Had fun while learning new science-related stuff. Took us a half day (around 4 hrs) in order to go around the whole place. Definitely a must-visit for anyone interested in science.
,,Good but pricey,4.0,,"We took our 5 yo to kid stop playground on a rainy day, The entrance cost about s$85 for 2 adults and 1 child including 1 hour on the show playground . My daughter had fun at the playground we had spent there about 2 hours. The snow area was freezing cold though. Even though you get warm jacket and boots , and you can also rent pants , we couldn,t spend more than 10 minutes there. The snow is far from real . Kids can't makes Snow ball with it . waste of time and $"
,,weird science,4.0,,"The Singapore Science Centre main target audience are the children but the fact and principles are just as appealing to the adults. There are over thousand interactive exhibits spanning 14 galleries, Science Centre Singapore is an ideal space to inspire the next generation.
We enjoyed Trekking to the centre of the earth through a crack in the surface to discover the different layers that lay beneath.
These are just some of the fun activities that can be found at 20 permanent exhibitions we note that Shows and demonstrations are scheduled daily and are designed to make learning exciting. We had so much fun with the kids and we adults learned something new. The Science Centre also boasts two other key attractions. The Omni-Theatre is Singapore’s only IMAX dome theatre, which features a 5-storey high dome screen that immerses us into the action. For a taste of winter in the tropical city, make sure to step into the Snow City, Singapore’s first permanent indoor snow centre. While we were there, we watched The Snow Show, a brilliant performance on the ice, and we discover more about the properties of ice, snow and water. If you are travelling with kids and interested in science it would be a well worth experienced day. , I highly recommend.
Admission is S$6 Adults, S$3 Child
Omnimax Theatre Admission S$10 per Adult per movie, S$5 per Child per movie open from 10am to 6pm from Tuesday through Sunday."
,,"Overpriced, over hyped, over rated",2.0,,"Tickets too expansive for what it's worth;
Adult at S$30,00 and kids S$22.00 (Come with free cardboard minus pencil/pen for filling questionnaire).

The ""Laser Maze"",
queued for nearly an hour and queue is not moving. Only 1 participant at a time and it takes forever! I noticed 90% of the queue gave up and 70% of the lot don't even know what they queued for as they thought it was necessary. Lack of staff at this area to keep customers informed or usher the moving crowd.

WYSINWYG;
I was looking forward to see dressed up Transformers interacting with my kids like as advertised on TV, was disappointed. None showed up or move around. The only place where my kids really enjoyed was at the ""Ball Pit"". Yes, I paid S$74.00 (1 Adult 2 Kids) to get in to ""Transformers Ball Pit"",

Activity Stations;
Reasonably priced for the foam coloring section, S$5.00 for 2 printed and cut out foam board of Transformers. However, it's not really exciting. Then again, the activity corners are all crafts that is time consuming and long seat occupancy will be normal. Again I see parents giving up queue.

Conclusion;
Trust me, eXplorerkid in Downtown East will only cost you a third of the price and 10 times the fun for your kids. This place is not for the usual kids, it's for serious ""Transformer"" fans who will appreciate over sized static figurines and collectibles.

Overall: 2 Stars out of 5"
,,Good place to learn!,4.0,,"This attraction is quite affordable in comparison to other attractions in Singapore. There is quite a lot to do in the exhibition halls. Younger children may not learn very much from the visit for even though the exhibits are interactive, the information boards are wordy and parents must explain the exhibits to their kids. Some of the shows are quite entertaining for the children and the Tesla Coil show is really exciting. My kids like the insects show.

Some of the exhibits are a little weird and spooky. Like the Einstein dummy climbing up the rope and some parts are still being refurbished I think. The themes in the exhibition halls are not strong and there is a sense that things are just thrown together.

The Wallace exhibition on the mezzanine floor is pretty interesting but it's too heavy-going for children.

There is a new place dedicated to young children called Kidstop. Entry into Kidstop is separate and expensive. After paying for an annual $30 membership for EACH child, admission fees come up to about $50 for 2 adults and 2 children (30% off original price). However, the 1st admission for an adult/child pair is included in the membership fee so it's worth getting the membership if you make more than 1 visit in a year because if you're not a member of Kidstop, admission fee into Kidstop would be $80-ish for 2 adults and 2 kids.

At Kidstop, parents must be committed enough to explain the science behind the exhibits to the kids or it would just be a large, well-equipped indoor playground to them. Lots of cool things for pretend play like a supermarket, a sand pit where they can dig up a dinosaur fossil, plane cockpit, construction site, giant lego, large climbing areas, a clinic/surgery etc.

Tips:
It's easy to get to the Science centre from the Jurong East MRT. (head towards JCube).

Dining options are LIMITED. The service in Mcdonalds is one of the slowest I've seen especially when it's lunchtime (few counters, not so many staff). Cafeteria food not very appetising. We usually spend half a day in the Science centre and get our food in JEM or Westgate.

There's a fairly new section on Earth Science. Quite fun. The earthquake simulator was a hit with my kids. There's also storm simulator (essentially a wind tunnel type thing) but the line for it was too long.

There is a water playground but the changing area is REALLY COLD. Also, there is no shade so water play is not an activity for midday.

Kidstop has 2 entry times (10am and 3pm on weekends. Weekday timings are different. Please check on their website) I think you pay for 4 hours of play each time. Between 2-3, Kidstop is closed for cleaning. Expensive but if compared to indoor playgrounds in Singapore malls, it's actually quite reasonable (e.g. Amazonia in Great World City). We found out that adult tickets are not transferable so parents cannot form a tag team using one ticket, e.g. one parent accompanies the child first while the other takes over later with the same ticket. I feel this is unreasonable as the attraction has nothing to offer grown-ups and we're really there just to watch the kids

The outdoor area has a trampoline and some fun exhibits like swings etc with the science behind them explained on signboards.

Special exhibitions like the Transformer's Exhibition or Human Body Experience require an additional fee but not always worth the extra money. I have not seen the Transformer's Exhibition but I saw the Mega Bugs one and the Dinosaur one which cost quite a lot and was just a lot of large model insects or dinosaurs and were poorly annotated and of limited educational value. (In contrast, I saw the dinosaur exhibition at the Art Science Museum and that was sooooo good in comparison, truly world class!) My kids loved the Human Body Experience though (They pass through the digestive system, from the mouth to the anus. My boy loved that he got 'pooped' out)"
,,Good,4.0,,"A day of entertainment for the kids. I went with my cousin, nephew and niece. The kids had the time of their lives. My cousin and I enjoyed too because we like science related stuff, but the kids definitely enjoyed it more. I guess it's a place to go if you are with kids and it will pretty much take an entire day to go through the whole place. Everything is well planned and is utter fun. It's not very expensive either considering we can spend a lot of time there."
,,Great for children and adults!,5.0,,"Ok, I have never been to a science center before, so I cannot compare with previous ones. So, if you have seen others in the past, chances are it's better that you check their website to see if it could be a good option for you or not.

BUT, if you like us, have a child and want to have a ball for the entire day: that's the place! Sooooo many things to do, experiment and see. My daughter went ballistic with the human body (where you can actually get into a huge human body and go through all the bits of it, learning a lot about how it works) and the electricity part. The aerodynamic part was the one that my husband liked the most and for me.....I liked them all.

Location wise: green line and 2 minutes walk and you get there!

My personal feeling is that, even if you have done something like this before, but your children are between 6 and 10/11, they are going to love it. Regardless you like it or not.

A note aside: for EVERY place you go to visit to Singapore, make sure to bring a jacket! The aircon is sooo low that I left the place shivering (and, yes, I had a jumper)."
,,Verry Much A Regional Or Even Local Attraction,3.0,,"Any international travellers who are science centre and museum tourists will be disappointed by the Singapore Science Centre. Run by the Ministry of Education, it was conceptualised as an outdoor teaching lab to complement classroom lessons on science and technology. It was not initially planned to be a tourist attraction per se. If you have been to London Science Museum, Paris Citi des Sciences et de l'Industrie, Seattle Pacific Science Centre, or Philadelphia Franklin Institute, the smart decision is to give this a pass. However it is popular with schools and students from Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, especially during the year-end school holidays. I observed many Singapore-based expats brought their kids along on a weekend. For the short-stay tourists, putting the western-situated (Jurong East) science centre or the imax omni theatre or the adjoining snow city on their itinerary does not seem an optimal move for those on shoe-string budget. A combo ticket to Science Centre-Omni theatre cost S$ 19/person. On the other hand, the science centre and museum tourist may just want to pop in, enjoy photo-op, get a couple of tickets, stamps and souveniers just to add to their memorabilia collection. A McDonald is located at the entrance; there is also a local food stall in the courtyard. Parents with young kids can enjoy the Kinetic Garden and Kidstop. This is the best science centre in Southeast Asia. Check their website in advance for events and new exhibits. Nearest subway: Jurong East. Taxis and public buses are widely available. Manage your expectations !"
,,Very nice place for children and adults,5.0,,Very nice place to spend a day with family. Very informative and we'll presented. Kids will definitely enjoy son as the adults too
,,Check out their 30th anniversary Transformers Exhibition,4.0,,"For a limited time from 1 Nov 2014 to 1 Mar 2015, The Singapore Science Centre brings you the ultimate Tranformers experience! Fans in Singapore could couple a day of exciting rides at the Universal Studio Singapore with upclose encounters with their favourite 7m tall Autobots at the Singapore Science Centre 30th anniversary Transformers Exhibition http://www.tf30.sg/

The display in Singapore is the last and the best, after stopping at Malaysia and Macau with an impressive local collection of Transformers figurines, a fun laser maze for children and adults to enjoy. It will definitely bring out the spark in you. There are also lots of activities lined up for the children from building robots to coloring and crafts."
,,thumbs up,4.0,,"I just visited it like few days ago. It was quite far from the city center as it lies in Jurong area.
So many things are put here. All about science not just simple physics but also about human body responses, military technologies, eco park and others... I only enjoy it for half of it in 3 hours... Hope to come here again to finish the whole area..."
,,Don't waste your time,1.0,,"There are loads of better places to be at if you're a tourist in Singapore. What is so ironic is that, the 'Science Centre' has nothing useful for you to learn. If you're interested in the topic of 'Science', I suggest you just surf the net (which is actually even better because you can specifically search for the field of Science you're interested in).

Entrance fees are exorbitantly high. Kids love this place because its more interesting than their textbook and their teacher. It presents Science in a more 'fun way' (yay!). And I'm talking about primary school (age 7-12) children."
,,No strollers in KIDSTOP area !,1.0,,"Don't plan a visit alone with a small baby, because if you're unable to carry your child during three hours (which is my case because of a back condition... but, to be honest, carrying a nine months baby for three hours is not really a pleasant situation anyway, even without a medical condition...) while the big one(s) are enjoying the KIDSTOP area... you'll be ask to wait for them at the entrance, at the stroller parking !! That's what happened to us last week...

AFTER paying my adult ticket 25$ (which, by the way, seems a little bit excessive to me for an adult ticket in a child play area...), I was told that strollers were not allowed inside the KIDSTOP area (""Or only if the baby is sleeping""... ok, so, if the baby fells asleep, I'll be suddenly allowed to come back ??)...

And the only solutions the staff offered was to stay with the baby & the stroller, leaving my two others kids without any supervision or even better, to leave the baby in the stroller, in the parking area (!!) to stay with my older kids...

So just be aware, that if you need to keep your stroller, you'll pay 25$ to stay in a stroller parking, and let your kids play during three hours without you.

Amazing !"
,,Excellent way to learn with fun,5.0,,"The science center is cater for any age group. If you are an explorer and eager to know more about anything. You can spend a day in the science center alone! You have no time to pay any other visit within the center!

KidStop is a great place for kid from 18 months until 9 or 10. They will have chances to explore the simple science as well. You can easily spend half a day in it, although the staff mention an hour is enough.

You may like to spend some time to visit the ""souvenir store"" for some purchases. We are regret to spare some time for it.

Ask staff for shows must see for no regret. Staff are friendly and helpful to answer any questions. Don't hesitate!

It's a place for family fun!"
,,A bit overwhelming and disorganised,3.0,,"I know I should give this place more stars because my kids loved going here....but there's just so much and it's all in no particular order, and at any one time half of it seems to be undergoing reconstruction.

The outdoor garden part is fun, albeit don't stay out in the sun too long, but the inside is very, very confused. There are lots of exhibits, but no real sense of an attempt to educate or interest - just present the whole universe and hope something sticks."
,,Awesome family day out,5.0,,We spent a day here and we didn't notice time passed so fast because we enjoyed our visit a lot. Recommended for a family day out. Kids and adults friendly
,,Kids Stop - a new twist on indoor playplace - but super expensive!,4.0,,"They've done a good job of refurbishing the fairly dated Singapore Science Centre. They're updating inside the museum, and re-doing the outdoor water and dry play areas. The iMax and McDonald's on the premises make for a complete experience. but the relatively new attraction is the Kids Stop which, as you would expect, combines science and fun - and does a great job. the play areas are very diverse, ranging from a sand area where kids can dig for fossils, a grocery store to do shopping, an anatomy type of experience to see the human body on the inside, along with airplanes, balls which go through all kinds of tubes, etc. The two big attractions in the back are a really cool climbing area which I've never seen designed like that before, and this really cool slide where they suit you up in a jump suit and helmet, pull you up with a rope, and let you slide down. And, a really good crowd of kids and parents, too - very friendly. My only concern is cost. it cost SGD36 for my daughter and myself. my experience is that most place places don't charge for parents. My, if you did the science center, imax, kids stop, and snow city all in one day - and you easily could - it would cost a fortune. although they have package prices, it's still just way too high - wish someone would give that a reality check. I almost thought for that price why not go to the more impressive Singapore Zoo. Anyway, still great reviews for this place, give it a try."
,,Nothing much,2.0,,There is nothing special or much about this science centre. Not really worth a visit away from the city for this. Food options are also pricey and limited apart from a macdonald outlet.
,,Great Fun through Learning How things Work,3.0,,"We took our 9 year old grandson who had been there before. This occasion we spent some time explaining some of the exhibits which probably need a bit updating. The Human Body experience was excellent, taking us through the organs and other parts of the body. Most disappointing of all was the cafeteria. By 1:30pm, most of the items on the menu had gone, the chips with the fish were soaked in oil, quite inedible. Our toast with 2 runny boiled eggs were not worth the money. Having been visiting Singapore since 1995, it is the worst restaurant I've eaten in. There is a McDonalds outside the gates, but we discovered it too late. I hope the Singapore Tourist Organisation takes note!"
,,Fun learning experience,5.0,,"very interesting place for kids and even for us.especially my elder son(8 yrs)was very eager n enthusiastic to see and know.we went to the human body experience,it was very good and also saw fire tornado show and the sound show which were very good.lot more things,can easily spend half a day."
,,"A fun, exciting educational day out with kids :) You could easily spend half a day there and have a good time!",4.0,,"We were visiting Singapore for 10 days and were keen to check out the Human Body Experience which was being held at the Science Centre. Its truly an exciting place, lots of educational things to see and do, and the kids will be thoroughly entertained. My kids were aged 8,6 and 2.5 and it was very fun for them. The Human Body Experience - where you get to walk through a replica of a huge human body learning about the different parts - was a very educational experience, and we all got a laugh coming out of the 'bum' at the end hahaha We didn't see the snow bit because we've already been to Ski Dubai in the UAE, and we knew it wouldn't be on par to that, so we didn't want to waste our money.

My only small complaint is that a few thing weren't working properly, so the children couldn't get the benefit of learning anything from it. But it was still a fun place, you could spend a good half a day there :)"
,,Fun Day Out,3.0,,"Went here with 3 grandchildren aged 4,5,8,they had heaps of fun,lots of exhibits,kids loved the fact they could ""touch things"",anyone from Perth would liken it to Sci Tec.We took the Snow City package,after seeing Snowtown in Bangkok,this was a disappointment,although the two youngest hadn't seen snow,so that was a thrill for them."
,,Great with kids,5.0,,"Interactive museum, great to spend a rainy day in Singapore. The shows are very well done and interesting for all."
,,"Great visit for kids, big and small",5.0,,"We visited here on a very wet and hot Singapore day. It's straight forward to get here by public transport but it's very long. We opted for taxi when leaving.
Our kids are 11,9and 6 years old. And they loved the place. We stayed until closing. Even then they wouldn't leave the interesting gardens out front. It's all very educational presented in a clean, spacious and enticing way. The kids think they are just playing when in fact they are learning heaps. We all loved the BodyExhibit where you get swallowed and pass through the human body. Shows were good too. Highly recommend."
,,nice play for kids,3.0,,"this place has various topic about science to explore. But I'm not interested in any of it (there are some I've never known but most of it I've known and learnt). It was too boring. I think it's really good for kids. It'd be fun if you are under 18 and you go with your school or your friends. It's the place you can learn a lot. To me, there's nothing fun or interesting in Science Center. However, I do love Human Experience (do I remember right?) and Snow City. Human Exp is not as cool as its advertising but I love it. The way they try to make us understand more about ourselves is really interesting. I knew all of it but the place was so entertaining and I'd love to go back. Regarding to Snow city, although it just had a little place but I love that snow hill lol very interesting. I cant remember how many times I played it. Overall, this place is okay."
,,Perfect For Adults and children as well,5.0,,The place is big enough to be not boring at all. All areas are interesting for children and adults as well.
,,'KidsStop' is a perfect stop,5.0,,"Visited with 6 yr old.
There is something for all age groups.
Educational & fun, so much to explore...
Short one hour trip to SnowCity & tubing was good fun - won't recommend two hours though.
Li Jiang restaurant outside the Kids Stop serves great food at a reasonable price, $20-30 per person would feed u well. Very much recommended.....
will be coming back for sure.
Visited on Friday, might get busy on weekends just like anything in Singapore..."
,,Well-made!,5.0,,"This Science Center is so educational especially for kids with family! If I had a kid, I'd bring them here again."
,,True to its name! Great place for the lil ones,5.0,,You do need a whole day to enjoy all it's on offer. You should see the sound show and the tesla's electricity show! You'll be shocked! Gr8 fun for the whole family especially for the lil ones.
,,Take your kids there,5.0,,"Science Centre Singapore is good for kids. I was a kinda newly wed when I last visited it but I sure would love to go Singapore again when my son (Ibrahim) grows up little :)

Singapore overall is recommended. Although 10 days is fairly good period to visit everything in there."
,,visit if your child is above 10y,4.0,,complex principles of science explained very simply for the grasp by young minds.. the touch and feel of things will make the understand of things long lasting.. young kids may not ne bale to comprehend most exhibits but kids above age 8 atleast will still come back with lot of learning..
,,super love this place,5.0,,we went here with my friends' kids. the place is so perfectly awesome that it will not entertain kids but adults as well. kids will definitely be inspired with science learnings. i will definitely bring my kid here too when he comes back to singapore!
,,Looks ruins.,2.0,,"Not much things will attracts adults. For kids, don't expected them to learn much, as they'll spent most time playing than learning. Take it as children theme park with no rides. Bring along extra children clothes as they'll get wet from playing water.
Ruins, as lots of equipment looks old, some spoiled and some science topic very boring."
,,Excellent Exposure to Scient,5.0,,"W really enjoyed the trip to this science centre. We spent half a day here viewing most of the exhibits and we watched a demonstration show call fire tornado which was very impressive. Another of the exhibits that stood out was the Human Body Experience (HBX) which was an excellent temporary exhibit, though you have to pay extra for it. I highly recommend you visit and while you are there also view one of the shows at the Omni theatre next door. Another next door place is Snow City which I recommend you avoid as it is a waste of money."
,,"Adults will be disappointed, but children loves it",1.0,,"During the June 2014 school holidays, we decided to make our first trip to Science centre to show our boy (7 yrs old) the Human Body Experience and the Imax movie (at the Omni theatre). Tickets for normal entry to science centre plus Human body exhibition and the Imax movie cost us a dear $90 for a family of 3. And I have not included parking fees and meals. For meal, there is only the MacDonalds which was crowded and dirty. We waited 20 mins to get a table, and another 20 mins to queue for food.

As for the exhibit for the normal entry to Science centre, very disappointing. There are no signs to indicate the timing of the shows and demonstrations. None of the shows and demonstrations happened on our trip there even thou we spent more than 4 hours in there.

I am not very wow by the Human Body Experience, as my boy was more frightened with the entire experience than enjoying it. The sound effects during the walk inside the 'body' cum the lighting made it scary for him.

I think the only thing that the adults can enjoy was the imax movie. We chose the children show like the Animalopolis, which my boy enjoys very much.

Overall, my boy actually enjoyed the Science Centre very much. He loves to touch and play with whichever exhibit that was working. Not everything works.

The staff looks very young, they almost look like secondary school students to me, however they are all very courteous and answer my questions well.

Will only spend my money at this place once, no plans to return for another visit unless it is free."
,,Great for kids.,4.0,,Better way to explain a few things to kids about science. Good gift shop that has toys that teach science. Laser maze is an added attraction and the kids love it.
,,Perfect place to contemplate about your knowledge,5.0,,"Going with kids? No problem.
Going as couples? Lovely.
Going solo? Awesome.
Going with families? Great.
Going with group of friends? Excellent.

The place is a world class Science Museum (if you prefer so). Proper managements and constant improvements are making this place revisit-able. Not cheap but so are everything in Singapore. At least this one is educating and offers a lot of fun.
Make sure you spend a full day here!"
,,Visit if you have nothing to do,4.0,,"Good place, but some items are too old or not working.

You will have to take MRT away from CBD and walk around 500m from the station through interesting market.

We went there to entertain kids but we've seen better museums in Australia (Powerhouse in Sydney and Questacon in Canberra are just much superior)."
,,Good for children,3.0,,"This is good if you are traveling with kids. they can enjoy what is there. For adults there is nothing much. Compared to all other places that we visit in Singapore this is the least organized place.

It take some time to go to this place also. So better think twice about this visit. However, good thing about traveling there is you will get a chance to see Singapore ""country side"" :)"
,,Great place to spend about 5-6 hours with kids,4.0,,"Just visited today, it is a fun place with a lot of learning for kids between 7-early teens. Can easily spend 5-6 hours there. Lots and lots to see and learn.

Rated it at 4 stars coz some of the more interesting exhibits do not work which defeats the purpose of the visit.

Look out for kids on a school trip running riot all over the place. Their energy is infectious."
,,Nothing works,2.0,,"We went to the science centre in the hopes of being entertained on a rainy afternoon. It started off ok with all the illusions but from there onwards literally none of the exhibits worked. This is probably due to the amount of children beating them but still, bit of a let down."
,,Good for all ages,5.0,,I thought it would be interesting to my teens.hey I was wrong even I and my 8 yr old kid enjoyed it as much as my teens.it in fact a novice experience you will rearly get. Worth the time and money.
,,"if you come with kids, they won't leave this place!",5.0,,"the staff very friendly, they teach alot of thing with passion. i came with my causins and they loved to be here. me, my husband and my brother love it also.and i learn how to fly a plate with stick like chinesse circus did.they teach over and over until i can...LOL thank youuuu...now i can work in chinesse circus..yey!! ^^"
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"1. The ticket is only 12 SGD. Worth every dollar
2. Most attraction is indoor so it's perfect for day visit in the hot Singapore
3. Big area and various things to see
4. Suitable for any age. They even have message chairs inside..

The only downside is the accessability. The MRT station is quite far. But there is bus stop nearby"
,,So much fun even for adults,5.0,,"As we were staying in Singapore for 2 weeks this time, we decided to take a train ride to go and visit Science Centre. I was a little sceptic as I thought the place was mainly for children but I was pleasantly surprised! The fee of $18 each gave us an entry to the centre and we stayed half the day there enjoying all the little things we didn't even know as an adult! There are so many exhibits and each one of them was all interesting. Some of the things I remember seeing as a kid long time ago such as ""trick eye"" was so much fun.

If you have children and wanting a day to spend without spending too much money, I would recommend Science centre as one of the place to visit. As a teacher myself, I could easily bring my students here and can imagine them enjoying the day. There were many children and it was really good to see them having so much fun and they didn't even know that they were learning!
Even for adults, it is a bit of an eye opener and refresher. I could've easily spend longer if I had more time.

It is a bit of a way from the the CBD as it would take around 45-60 minutes by train from Orchard or the surrounding areas. But the station you will get off, ""Jurong East"" has nice shopping centres as well as some local arcades. If you are in Singapore for a few days then not really the place but if you have more time to spare, it would be an interesting and different way to experience Singapore I am sure."
,,Recommended for adults and Kids,5.0,,"The experience was great. kids enjoyed it so much they want to come back everyday. Aside from being interactive, it is very informational. Even adults will learn a lot. thumbs up for the accommodating staff too. Aside form the good presentation, the centre facilities are good."
,,"Educational, interactive and fun",5.0,,"My 4 and 6 year old love the visit especially the human body experience. It made my 6 year old very interested in biology. The queues for some shows can be quite long. Overall, fantastic educational place to take kids to. Will be back again."
,,Fun For The Whole Family,4.0,,"Fun adventure for all ages - something for everyone. Probably best suited to older children, but the young ones can still wander around and press the buttons on all the displays. The water-play area was a good place to finish. We found it best to catch a taxi from our hotel to the Science Centre."
,,Very disappointed,2.0,,"Many of the exhibits were not functioning. Robots / robotics were one of the main attractions for my child. There was only one item that looked vaguely like a robot (as per my child's perception). The body exhibit was an extra charge which would have been reasonable had the main attraction provided era by good value. Furthermore I noticed another exhibit which was coin operated. Three different rooms/ exhibits were off limits because they had been booked by parties. I thought this was very bad form. Not impressed. My child was going crazy since there were no robots. I have seen better robotics displays set trade fairs. If I could identify any redeeming remark it would be that the dinosaur at the entrance ( before you pay) was impressive for the kids. There were a few other very attention grabbing exhibits such as the Jacobs ladder and the tesla coil. The fire tornado was great. But overall, per square meter, there are not as many attractions as there could be mostly because they are not functioning / have not been maintained."
,,Human Anatomy Show is a Winner,4.0,,"My 6 year old did the Human Anatomy twice and loved it both in presentation and content. Absolutely awesome presentation from her POV. Though i must confess that she's a bit of a geek so may not be every kid's cupoteah.

Good for 3 3.5 hrs but situated off the main tourist circuit off the jurong east interchange."
,,Don't miss the Human Body Experience,4.0,,"The Science Centre had something for kids of all ages although I would agree with another reviewer that it's not so educational for younger kids. Our 6 yo had great fun testing out all the different stations but I doubt he came away with much knowledge. His favourite part was actually watching the newly hatched chicks. I personally enjoyed the Human Body experience and would definitely recommend paying the extra cost to do it. Even if my son didn't learn anatomy, it was really neat having to climb through a replica of the insides of a human body."
,,Unusual Shape,4.0,,With its lotus flower shape it makes for a very impressive building A great photographic exhibition by Annie Leibovitz (Rolling Stones photograher) and Dinosaurs Dawn to Extinction currently showing.
,,Probably would suit older kids more,3.0,,"The Science Centre is a fair way out of town and as we were in Singapore on holidays we went by MRT and it took an hour. The ticket office kindly gave us the concession price so for the three of us including our six year old grandson it was not expensive to do the basic science centre entry. Our grandson pushed, pulled and hit everything he could but really did not learn anything about science. Perhaps older kids that can read and understand the science bits would get something out of it. By the way give the adjacent Maccas a miss worse Maccas meal we have ever had."
,,"Educational, informative and fun for kids and adults.",5.0,,Science center is educational and informative. Children can also have fun in it. We like especially the section regarding the human anatomy.. It was newly opened and really worth seeing. My kids love it. Worth going.
,,Memorable learning journey,4.0,,"17 June 2014, a few of us adults brought our children for an excursion to the Science Centre and Omni Theatre.
I have not been there for many years so most of the exhibits for me are quite new and exciting!
The children moved along so fast and I could not catch up with much of the reading. The sound show which was 20 mins was interesting for the young kids. We also saw the 10 mins lightning show. Omni theatre was a delightful place. The show was about the Ice Age. It was a relaxing outing as we brought our lunch and ate at the Kinetic Garden, the adults talking and the children playing at the Garden."
,,Very Educational,5.0,,"A very educational attraction. We only purchased the basic Science Centre entrance ticket and it is more enough to cover the whole day there. Singaporeans enjoy local price and passion card holders enjoy extra discount.

Be sure to be there early as the place is very big with many halls (Hall A to F). Each hall covers few topic.

There are shows and talk almost hourly and try to attend them, these are very educational. We only manage to attend 2 shows as we reached there quite late at 12.30pm, our priority is to cover the whole place. Thus, be there early in the morning so you are able to cover most of the show/talk and the whole place.

Water coolers and toilets are located at every halls and food is easily available at a higher price. There is a McDonald outside Science Centre's main entrance. Parking fee is S$0.50 per every half an hour. The nearest MRT is Jurong East with 10-15 mins walk."
,,A place to entertain kids,4.0,,"The omni theatre is a must-see. They are seasonal exhibits like in June, the human digestive system. Entrance fee apply. Some exhibits are free. A lot to entertain the children with hands on activities."
,,Fantastic science shows,5.0,,"Yes the general exhibits are a bit dated but the shows make up for it and more. I took an 18 month toddler and a 4 year old. The sound show was nearly half and hour but they both sat through it watching and listening intently. The chap who did the show was entertaining and the way a sound wave was shown to us by playing music through a BBQ gas burner was clever, educational and entertaining.
We also went to a show where a thermal image camera was trained on the children to teach them about body heat but also a great way of demonstrating the way different materials respond to heat. Again a hit with the kids.
The tesla demo was great too. My tip with small children is to watch from the upper balcony where you don't have to fret about them climbing the fence and having a 3million volt shock."
,,An aging attraction with streaks of vibrancy,4.0,,"Most of the artifacts have been updated and were in good working order. As it was the school holidays, many school volunteers were around to add vibrancy to the place. We also enjoyed the human body exhibition which was on."
,,Good Deal,3.0,,"For the price you pay it is worth a visit. We were there on a Saturday and it was a relaxing and fun day (no crowds and out of the heat). If your child is quite young they probably won't find the centre that interesting. Most of it is geared towards older kids...at least elementary age. Our 6 year old had a good time. Some of the exhibits/areas were a bit run down and old but there was still plenty to do and look at. We wrapped up the day at the Kinetic Garden which is a fun area. The new kid area opens in June so we will have to come back at some point to check it out as well as the water works area that is currently under renovation. All in all, a good deal for an educational and fun day out."
,,A rainy day out,5.0,,"Oh wow, we visited here on the last day of our stay with our grand daughter. She had been before and wanted to go again and seeing it was raining it was a great choice. As we were pensioners they only charged us £3 and £4 for our grand daughter. What a bargain. We spent 4 hours there and still didn't see everything. There is so much for all ages to see, watch and take part in. It is very well laid out and just so much information there. Learnt quite a lot my self!!!! There are places for food and drink. Definitely worth a visit and will go again on our next visit. So worth the money."
,,Great all-weather day out for children 4-10 years old,5.0,,"Our kids love this place, and we love it, too. There's always a new presentation or exhibition to learn from, and if the weather changes (as it often does in Singapore) we can still find something to enjoy.

Kids who are a bit too young to understand the background science can still enjoy the outdoor play areas (splash park, tree house and eco garden, kinetic garden) and indoors it's great for them just to find things that are hands-on. By the time they're about four they can start to grasp some of the concepts as well. Topics range from mathematical to biological, giving a broad base.

Our son has also enjoyed star-gazing at the observatory on Friday nights (from 5yo and up, free to join in).

On the downside, it isn't really centrally located, and I don't see a big appeal for older age groups. We'll definitely be renewing our membership for years to come, though."
,,Dated,3.0,,Been years since i last visited here..many interesting simple science artifacts and projects for young kids but places seems abit dated..now its undergoing some renovation..hoping for a better science centre in the near future..
,,"We enjoyed stargazing, above all else 😀",4.0,,"I would have given an excellent rating if not for some exhibits that are either non-functional or have remained broken. Nevertheless, we had an enjoyable day, my 8-year-old couldn't stop telling stories about her experience. My daughter and I had a fantastic time learning more about our environment and science, in general. She also spent a lot of time outdoors in the Kinetic Garden from closing time to stargazing at 7:50PM.
We intentionally came on a Friday for stargazing. It was actually our first time to see Mars and Jupiter! We peeked thru a huge telescope in The Observatory to see Jupiter and its four moons. Impressive! The staff also taught us how to use the sky map and pointed some stars for us to appreciate.
I salute the enthusiasm of the staff. Injecting humor to their presentation has indeed kept their audience's attention.
If you have been to 4-D movies, the Omni Theather may be skipped. There are already a lot of things to do and see in the Science Centre itself. I should say, if you're travelling with bigger kids, this is something that shouldn't be missed in Singapore."
,,a bit tired by Singapore standards - but worth a visit,3.0,,"We have a three-year old, and this one was probably a bit too sophisticated for her. I imagine it will appear more to 8 years and older. By Singapore standards, this one is a bit older and squeaky, not so many bells and whistles that make you go wow. The entire area is just a bit rough around the edges. They need a major overhaul to catch up with the other attractions. Even the food is a bit rough. all that said, it's worht a visit if you've done the sentosa and other grand attractions. it is multi-level and has the various things you would expect in a science museum, though I don't remember what they really are. oh - a couple of the things didn't even work. ok, three stars is kind - hope these guys get funding for a facelift. i've read the nearby omni theatre just re-opened - let's hope that's better, and we've yet to try the snow city."
,,The Best Museum in Singapore,5.0,,"Where else can you get cool science shows, a Tesla Coil demo and so many hands on things to do for adults and children alike. We were in awe. We should have planned a whole day there, not three hours. This is top of our list when we come back to Singapore. Don't waste time next door with Snow Planet tho' - we felt it was a bust if you live in a country with snow."
,,Jaded attraction,1.0,,I won't even call this place a tourist attraction. Old exhibitions and whole building seems badly maintained. Food inside the centre is bad so please plan to eat before or after your visit. Guides were lost when we asked for clarification. I think spending the weekends with my kids over discovery channel or science magazines will be more fruitful than a visit here.
,,Waste of time,1.0,,"We were very disappointed by this place. It's a fairly long taxi ride from downtown and our two teenaged sons enjoy going to science/technology museums in many of the cities we visit on our travels. But for a city that's trying to be at the cutting edge of the technology revolution, I have to say this place was terrible. If your kids are above kindergarten age, there's nothing here for them. Watch out Singapore - Tokyo's Miraikan is awesome and if it represents the kids of the future, Japan will eat your lunch!"
,,Poor setup and tired,2.0,,"Visited with three six year olds. We had high expectations but it's tired and old.

Lot of items are poorly designed, for example in the sound area there is do much noise that you can't hear anything from the individual attractions.

Restaurant is the same old same old MacDonald as everywhere..

To avoid. Needs massive restauration"
,,Fun for kids,3.0,,"Only go if you have kids. do take note of its top attractions which are fire tornado and tesla performance. you can check brochure for the time. recommended morning 11 until 5 to fully utilize and visit all the major attractions.

Location is 5 minutes walking distance away. Out from Jurong east Mrt, walk towards to the J cube there. The science center is located some distance bedhin J cube mall"
,,one of the best spot in Singapore to spend with your family,5.0,,"even I'm already adult and not a huge fans of scientific thingy, I'm still enjoying the ambience to experience more the attraction in here."
,,Massive display. Information overload.,4.0,,"Have not been to a science centre that is so jam pack with this amount of information. Come here if you want to have a read about everything. However if you are looking for a place to bring your kids for a leisurely day out and have some interactive fun while learning something, suggest you try some other place. This place is for serious information overload."
,,Awesome Science attractions,5.0,,Not very popular for honeymoones and oldies; but if you are going with school going kids; this is a must see place for a half day visit.Favourites are the Fire Tornado and Tesla coil shows.Also enjoi the Coolest fun at snow city. Kids would love building snowman and whizzle down from heights!!!!
,,Learning about science is fun,5.0,,"We’ve been here several times, and always leave with interesting new knowledge, taught in a fun way. In addition it shows the important contribution to science made by Singapore. Yes, a few demonstrations don’t work, but overall we always have a good day here.
If you come by MRT, make sure you know the way from the station. It is not signed at all currently. To make matters worse, the shortest route is along a footpath beside the shopping mall, which is not shown on the locality map in the station.
Don’t attempt to see everything in one day, there is far too much to see in one visit. Each time we concentrate on just a few galleries, and save the rest for future visits.
Don’t miss the fire tornado demonstration, it’s awesome.
There’s a McDonalds on site, as well as another cafe. Lockers are available for 50c
Children and adults will enjoy it, and it’s a useful facility for overseas visitors as well as locals."
,,Need a whole day to see it properly,5.0,,"This place is huge. We took the MRT and then a bus to get here but didn't have enough time to see everything there is to see and do. There was also a dinosaur exhibition on while we were there (Titans of the Past) which we made sure we saw.
You really do need a whole day to see everything."
,,Enjoyable!,4.0,,"This was my first time taking the train here and, although it isn't a long walk away, if you intend to take the train here too, make sure to check your (walking) route as there aren't any signs (or at least we didn't spot any!) guiding you here and most people (we'd asked) don't know where it is. Although this was my third visit to the centre, I hadn't been here since 2008 and was looking forward to my visit, more so too since my travel buddy has never been here.

The centre is huge with exhibits not only inside the building but also in the garden. Yes, the place is rather old as it's been around for a while but there are also many new areas. Do also check for special exhibitions that may be going on. There was a dinosaur exhibition on when we visited but we had to give it a miss due to lack of time. I won't go into details (there's too much!) about the centre but I will say be prepared to spend the whole day here, especially if you want to see, read, try, experience the exhibits inside and outside the building and catch the science shows too! We arrived at about 1.30pm and the centre closes at 6pm - that was about 4.5 hours and we still didn't finish doing everything!

There are eateries within the centre - a MacDonald's and another little cafe, so, there no need to worry about food. There are also lockers available (for S$1), lots of clean toilets around the centre and the building is stroller/wheelchair friendly. The admission fee is S$10 for adults, which is on par with many other museums in Singapore and, to me and my friend, it was money well spent.

Yeah, sure, for the most part kids and parents with kids make up the majority of the visitors but as an older teen/adult do give place a go - it's more fun than you think! Plus, there's always something new to learn or it could be a pleasant trip down memory lane remembering all the stuff you'd learnt in school."
,,"If you're traveling with kids, it's a must see",5.0,,"A huge fan of Science Centres, I had to see this one. It felt a bit dated, but was enjoyable nonetheless. The dinosaur exhibit was featured and enjoyable. While some of the exhibits were facsimiles, it was wonderful to share these ancient creatures with a child. While there are certainly better Science Centres around the globe, if you have a free spot in your itinerary and love Science, as I do, stop by for a visit. Don't miss the Tesla Coil show (and cover your ears!)."
,,Once It was a Memorable Visit,2.0,,"My sweet memory goes back to 1989 when I first visited SCS as a child. At that time all the exhibits were very interesting that I can still recall half of them 20 years later. Last March I was really looking forward to take my husband and 4 yo son to revisit SCS. But I got quickly disappointed knowing the place were poorly maintained that some of the exhibits were not functioning well. Also many of the displays were exactly the same as I have seen in 1989. The food choices were quite limited. After 30 minutes we all bored. We only enjoyed the Fire Tornado show. This is sad because of my high expectation that we have traveled so far, took bus from&to Bencoolen during rainy season.

Hope the SCS management would update their exhibits and improve the cleanliness."
,,In Need of Major Revamp,3.0,,"I have visited the science centre at 7. Fast forward 30 plus years and with two kids, my wife and I brought them there. Entrance was cheap...local adult price of $10 and $6 for kids. In the age of theme parks, multi-media presentation and special effects, this place needs to keep up with the times. Half of the exhibits with computer systems were not functioning very well. The upper level felt very make shift. We were all quite bored and the exhibits doesn't quite appeal. There seem to be some nationalistic/government involvement with the exhibits on defence technology, biotechnics, genetics to tie in the govt heavy spendings. It is a very old place since the 70s, time for a fresh remake and bring in the experts from overseas."
,,Educational Tour,5.0,,"Plenty of hands on exhibits and it's surely the best place in Singapore to learn science. Do buy tickets to watch the imax movies. It's one of our most memorable shows.

Then there's a cafe & sakura buffet restaurant near the entrance to the imax theatre. Try the rosti ( pan fried potatoes strips ) at the cafe. It goes very well with sour cream!

Last tips:

Since you are already nearby, visit the 2 new shopping malls just beside Jurong East MRT. Namely West Gate & JEM. The famous hongkong dim sum outlet Tim Ho Wan can be found in West Gate #01-13/14."
,,great exposure of concepts to kids & adults,5.0,,"We visited the Singapore science center in December'13. Its an amazing place for both kids and adults. We can spend one full day here easily. lots to do and read. varied concepts are covered in an fun and easy way. the water park is also good relief from the heat!! when we visited the exhibit was based on the dinosaur called as titans of the past. it was ok since none of the exhibits like fossils were real. all were replicated only saving grace was a huge dinosaur with head movement and corresponding sound!! other than that u can actually just buy the ticket for the science center. booking online is best idea. weekends can be quite a rush.
the place has good public transport connectivity. nearby is a huge mall."
,,Entertaining - best for 7-12 yr olds,4.0,,"The main entry hall is more ""Ripley's Believe It Or Not"" optical illusions and tricks with little information regarding the trick. Many of the displays/science are quite old but the newer ones are interesting. Some displays go into oddly deep detail (like how a physics equation was derived in calculus) while others provide very little information. But the kids had a good time and it is a good way to spend an afternoon or more. The year membership is a great deal if you will go more than once. The food choices are quite limited unless you walk back to the MRT and visit the mall or hawker center.

There are also a lot of hidden areas where you can get a break from the crowds if you are there on a busy day. The Eco-garden is rather large if you don't mind being outside. If you want to spend another couple of hours there bring a swimsuit or change of clothes and visit the water play area - my son (4) can spend hours there. This is for the slightly younger crowd (3-7) though kids of all ages can find something fun to do."
,,Better than expected,4.0,,The main reason we came was for the dinosaur exhibit - my son loved it. Titans of the past was very well done. There are lots of other things to occupy the kids for at least half a day. Bring along swim clothes if you're going into the water park. It is located in the west and rather far from city. Taxi is the most convenient and economical as a family. However you will have to call for a taxi home as they don't come very often.
,,Titans of the Past exhibit was amazing!,4.0,,"We went to the science centre specifically for this exhibition. And we weren't disappointed. So many great displays about dinosaurs and their biology. They have many genuine artefacts and also a lot of very good replicas. Some displays are moving with sound too! There are interactive activities for kids too, such as a paleo dig pit, clay modelling, colouring, etc.
The exhibit that follows is of prehistoric ice age animals. Fantastic!
Excellent for the $20 per person we spent."
,,Good for kids,4.0,,Good complex although too much to take in in one visit. Went with kids 4 and 7 They enjoyed it. Peak time so lots of people but Ok. Reasonable expensive. Easy to get at short walk through the mall from MRT station.
,,Pleasant Suprise,5.0,,"We were told that this was a place to check out, and we were surprised. We had figured that this would be a 1-2 hour trip like most museums geared towards kids. Our kids are 6 and 9. We got there at 11 and did not leave until after 3, and even then, it was mostly because Mom and Dad were tired. The museum was well done, in the fact that it had the basic hands on demonstrations that kept smaller ones occupied (push a button, the attraction moves.) As kids get older, they add the appropriate level of facts (education) until is passed the kid's level to the point that it kept dad's attention.

The only downside I would give the SCS, is their website is lacking a lot of useful information. It would have been nice to know that swimming clothes were a good idea for the full on water works area. BRING DRY CLOTHES. The SCS is missing an opportunity to make a couple of bucks by selling swim clothes in their shop.

Kids had fun in the laser maze, as we had never seen anything like that before. We were actually very happy with the coffee hive, slightly spendy, but it tasted good. The rosemary chicken with a (substituted) black pepper sauce was excellent."
,,paradise for the geeks..,5.0,,"we went to SCS twice, last may and december. both are very satisfying.
the special shows are must-watch~~
the exhibitions are eyes opening..
the food inside (coffee hives) is good but a bit pricey.
unfortunately we havent got the chance to join the stargazing session, but we plan to visit again in the future."
,,fantastic place for children,4.0,,"Went there with our grandchildren 4 and 7, they were taken in with all the things they could try. The Dinosaur department was fantastic, we spent over 2 hours in that department, had lunch in mc donalds and could go back in and try more things. Can realy recoment on a rainy day"
,,Science lovers must visit,5.0,,"I was always hesitant to go to the Singapore science centre as I always felt that science was never my cup of tea. One who has struggled with the physics for las and chemistry equations, always felt that Science centre was not for me.. However my perspective changed when I had to take my son to he science centre for his assignment. I truly loved it. A variety of working models explaining most of the concepts of science was an enriching experience. Most of the information was clearly provided and was self-explanatory.

It's a must visit for all science lovers."
,,See and learn science behind daily activities,5.0,,"The Science Centre is for all. One can see and learn the science behind various daily activities. A family may have a fun and educational outing, a teacher planning a school excursion, a tourist with a couple of hours to fill, or a science enthusiast wishing to expand your already broad horizons even further, you will find something interesting at the Science Centre.
To visit a particular exhibition or have a quick overview of the centre, one or two hours may be enough, but if you want the full experience of interacting with all our exhibitions, shows and activities, you will need more than a whole day. Fire Tornado Demonstration and Sound Shows are informative as well as entertaining. At Water Works, kids can play and soak with various water exhibits. They can dry up in Giant Dryer. More than 20 sections and exhibitions are on display here. Omni Theatre and Snow City are two other paid attractions."
,,Disappointed my eight year old,2.0,,"While visiting Singapore, put the science center on the list to do with my son. Took a 45 min train ride only to walk in the heat, and arrive sweaty to a center that didn't have most of its exhibits open to see. The dinosaur exhibit was closed, as was snow city, and several other sights and interactive activities. Determined to make use of our time, my son visited the candy unwrapped exhibit and spent the next several hours playing with a group of children from the local primary school.....thankfully! otherwise the highlight would've been eating at the Mc Donald's on site.....Not okay."
,,Average and just a one time visit,3.0,,"This is near the jurong Bird Park. So if you are interested in science details you can add the same into your itinerary.
Is very big and will take around 3 hours to cover the same.
They also conduct regular shows, the timings of which can be known at the entrance.
The nearest MRT is Jurong East"
,,You can spend the whole day here,4.0,,I came here once with my teenage step daughter and once with my other two step children who were 6 and 8 at the time and they all loved it. We spent a whole day here and the kids were very entertained. The place was huge. Even I found a lot of things interesting as an adult. It's a bit far to get to but it's well worth it if you need to spend a whole day some where. We visited here in 2011.
,,"Great, but hard to get there",3.0,,"The singapore science centre itself is really interesting. but one thing that annoyed me is that, it's really hard to get there. It's really far. I used MRT and Bus to get there. because the taxi fees are so high, so I decided to use a bus. But then, I was confused by the bus number. (e.x: it was supposed to be bus no.601 but they said it's wrong) so we looked for the bus number. It took me around 2 hours to do that. Then,, we're dropped near science centre, but we need to walk a little far from there to science centre. In the science centre, there are lots of interesting things. It is well organized, neat, and creative. There are Imax theater and lot more. But it quite cost a lot.
One tip if you're going to go there: If you've ever been there before, don't go there. It's a waste of time. Coz the items are the same. nothing changes for years."
,,It is often better to travel hopefully than to arrive.,3.0,,A tip when travelling here and in general for that matter. If some one tells you it is easy to get to by taxi CHECK on how long it will take to get back. Outbound in taxi 20 mins GREAT. In bound NIGHTMARE-NO taxi to be had for love (nor even very big sums of money) public transit at a distance and not easy to work out so it took 3 hours in 90f and 90% humidity!!! Oh had 4 year old in tow.
,,Good as before if not better,4.0,,"It's quite sometime probably about 2 - 3 years ago since i last visited this place with my children. This is not quite the kind of outing for my family. However, it turned out to be a surprise. I noticed some exhibits have changed and are very interactive/ interesting too. For example, the tornado chamber and earthquake 'room' provide a 'real' experience in a fun way. The fire tornado show at 3.00 pm is pretty exciting and my children love it."
,,Not good !,2.0,,"Mainly went to the science centre for the Planetarium but it was closed for renovation till 2014. Disappointed but was keen to explore the science center - it turned out to be a damp place as well. Not much interesting, Some exhibits do not work. It is not as lively as a science centre should be. The shows offer something of interest but something = very little. I would say its a one time visit. Quiet far from the city but well connected by MRT's and buses."
,,Good experience for kids,4.0,,The science centre has not been heavily marketed but i think it is a place you must visit with your kids. The exhibits are awesome while being educative and fun. Loved the illusions section and the quirky inventions section. Please do go with your kids.
,,Not much surprises but is great place for kids to explore,3.0,,"We drove there during Spore National day. Parking is not convenient for foreign car, you either pay (SGD8 per entry) or go get a Cash Card pay (65cents per hour). Be prepare during public holiday the queue to purchase tickets are very long (Begin from McD). Staff at the counter are very friendly, offered us to used the coupons for cheaper tickets price.

Too bad the Omni theater was closed for renovation, this is one of the attraction we are interested. Wondering where can we have a peek on the telescope to view moon or space? The Observatory !? but I think is open at night only.
The sound section was good, many hand-on experience. The rest like earthquakes simulator and cyclone simulator is fun. Something you can't missed is the illustration room near Mathematics section. Try take some pictures and you will see the adult has been shrink! (Kids stand on the left corner & adult at right corner)"
,,A great place to spend a day with young kids,4.0,,"A great place to spend most of a day with young kids, the Science Centre in Singapore is not marketed heavily to tourists, but is quite a delight. The Omni Theatre (currently closed for renovations till the end of Oct 2013) is a must-see for its series of IMAX movies. The exhibits are quite educational and hands-on where kids can learn a lot. There are many ""fun"" exhibits rather than just educational ones. The ""fire tornado"" exhibit going on now is quite spectacular. Try to go to some of the live demos they do, such as the one on sound. Only the EcoGarden outside is a bit of a letdown."
,,Take A package With Omni Theater for A New Experience,4.0,,"On last May 2013, we visited this science center and it was my second visit. The first One, l tried with snow City package and felt too overpriced ( in 2008). If you would go to Genting Highland in Malaysia, better tried there because they had same price in difference currency ( 30 RM and 30 SGD).
We took about 35 min from sommerset to Jurong East by MRT and then walked about 10 mins to reach this place. A bit far but worth to visit.
it was fun and had so many interesting objects to try inside this science center. Prepare to bring swimsuit or clothes exchange for your kids because they would love to play on waterwork.
l recommend to buy package With Omni Theatre for A new experience ( SGD 12 for adult and SGD 8 for child). All my family loved it and its film was so touched ( we chose movie about Panda). Would need whole day or at least 4 hours to spend."
,,Mostly for kids,4.0,,"A lot for the kids, even small ones. They enjoyed the the interactive displays and demos. There are also outdoor experiments and a water play area (we didnt try it but looked inviting on a hot afternoon). Less so for adults. Should spend about half a day to get the best out of this. Nearby is the Omnimax cinema which can be done at same time.

Perhaps fine if you have some time in Singapore as not a top tourist attraction and a little way out of the city. Could do it on the way to the Jurong Bird Park as not far from that.

Ensure you check for any deals on admission - we got one adult for free as it was free for those born in 1977."
,,"Good for a rainy day, or to get out of the sun!",4.0,,"Well laid out, informative displays. Some of the displays quite tired. We went at 10am and there were hardly any queues.when we left a 330, ot was heaving.

Went to the superbug display. Quite impressive paper mâché giant insects, in giant setting. But not a lot of information. More for the art than the science.

Top tips:
Book a taxi to get home, otherwise problematic
Take swim stuff for water fun bit
Need 6 hours to do it properly"
,,"Crowded , expensive but informative",4.0,,"During my visit , it was completely filled with School Students with Notes and Pens and assignments,literally sat on floors at all attractions, so we couldn't look on to each invention in detail. Food and drinks are available throughout. You may need half a day for this Tour. Lots of Scientific , mathematical, audio video, touch sensor inventions are exhibited, Amphitheaters and Snow Walks are there , need to pay separately other than Entrance tickets."
,,"Great Place, but far from the city..",4.0,,"went there with my cousin, not bad but it is not a must go place.. even though some of the science stuff are unique and fun for adults.. but if you are travelling with friends over 20 year old, that just switch to another place..time and the entrance fee is just not worth it for me.."
,,Must go attraction,5.0,,"I am not sure why this is rated as #34 attraction in Singapore! Are there 33 better attraction sin Singapore?? This is really a wonderful educational and fun place for kids and adults. There are several similar museums around the world, Franklin museum, Philadelphia, NEMO in Amsterdam etc. But I liked this museum very much. The shows are more interesting and engages kids and visitors. Even I learned a few things during the day! The fire tornado formation and the lightning show is very realistic and unforgettable. There are several other learning gadgets you really get the kids hooked. Besides the museum, there is an igloo as well, for people who haven't seen snow or like snow! IMAX movie is also quite nice and there area few shows you could chose from. Getting in and out quickly is a problem, so suggest calling a cab. The staff can call a cab for you, but there is an extra surcharge."
,,"A very nice place, though lacks some clarity",4.0,,"The Science Centre is exactly what it sounds like; a museum dedicated to all things science-y.

The entrance hall is devoted to an array of optical illusions, some of which were interesting, some not so much. The centre then divides into sections:

Sound - excellent
Candy - not bad, aimed primarily at children
Live animal display - contained a few turtles and a chicken hatchery
Marine Life - mainly plants, but also a few fish. Quite interesting
Uniquely You - interesting, but unfortunately many exhibits were out of order for our visit
Waterworks - a kids area, so we didn't go in. Looked like it would be fun
Viruses - not very interesting I'm afraid
Fire - not as good as it could have been, but ok
Electricity - excellent, especially the Tesla coil demonstration

As you can see, the centre has a real variety of exhibits, both in terms of content and quality. The main let-down was the robot exhibit. Having seen it on our map, we decided to leave it for last, thinking that it sounded excellent. However, it turned out that it is not an exhibit, rather it was a lecture hall for school groups. This was not marked anywhere on the map and was a bit of a let-down

A good day out, if you like this sort of thing. However, certain sections are lacking"
,,"A little jaded, but who cares!",4.0,,"Great few hours of entertainment. Yes, the centre needs a little TLC in places, and there were a couple of exhibits that were not working, but there was plenty to keep us occupied for several hours. Lots of interactive exhibits as one would expect, plus a couple of demonstrations. The IMAX was good too.
Our 11 year old chose this as our first attraction to visit in Singapore, even though ""I don't like science"". We had to drag her away.......
My only negative- the food outlets inside the centre are poor, so eat well before you go!"
,,Indoor and outdoor fun!,5.0,,"Good place to go with kids, unlike London its not free - but nothing is in Singapore!
Go prepared for the ""Water"" park with a change of clothes for the kids.
Kept my to (4 & 7) entertained and busy for 4 hours, and would have done longer if it wasn't closing time.

Recommend it, worth the journey out to the west coast from the centre."
,,Hidden gem,3.0,,"This is not there in any tours agenda. Kids may find the museum a bit boring as you need to read thru the science facts before you get to see the demo. For e.g. During the fire show while I was at awe, my daughter was literally pulling me away to buy something to eat. I was told that the electricity generation show is mind blowing but I missed. I chose the butterfly show and had a good sleep in the aircon theater after 15 mins of the show...but it later stuck me why one would research about a butterfly than an elephant or a snake/croc which is more fancied in nagger channels...if you have kids more than 8 years old esp. boys, then go for it. Otherwise you can give it a miss..."
,,Kind of a dump,2.0,,"It might be OK if you have *really* young kids, and you don't care. But the exhibits are quite hokey. The center is dark and kind of gross. It's quite commercial as well. One bright spot: The IMAX is OK for children's movies with nice visual scenery."
,,Not as slick as described but still fun,3.0,,"The Science Centre was greatly enjoyed by our 8 year old son. He loved playing with all the exhibits. We spent a couple of hours here and saw all there was to see. As it is an older place, some of the exhibits weren't working and it was looking a bit tired and dated compared to other Science Centres we have been to in other cities. But our son said that it was the best thing he has done in Singapore. It was very busy on a Saturday and we loved that the place was full of locals rather than tourists. It was easy to get to on the MRT and the directions for walking from the station on their website were helpful as we would never have found it otherwise. The exhibits outside were also quite interesting."
,,Questacon in Singapore,4.0,,"Science Centre was easy to get to, just a 10min walk from MRT. It's like Questacon in many respects - some of the exhibits are identical - but a bit bigger. We spent 3 hrs here, culminating at the water play area (bring a rashie for the kids - limited shade) - overall a great morning out if you're in Singapore with kids."
,,Fun Learning For All Ages,5.0,,"You and family can spend some 2 hours here, because Singapore Science Centre is very fun! We can learn and interact with my science things. It is too many to make a list.

You can go by MRT/ train to Jurong East MRT Station. You'll continue using bus. Forgot the bus number, but you can ask for direction. Returning from Science Center will be tricky, as not all bus stop at the bus shelter in the opposite road. You must read the route information at the bus shelter. Since you're traveling by bus, I suggest you get SMRT Card which you can top-up anytime anywhere. By using SMRT Card, you just tap the card at the machine during your boarding and alighting.

For further info you can go to their website http://www.science.edu.sg

For lunch you can go to Mc Donald's in the same building. I don't recall them having other restaurants.

The Science Center occasionally have special features. In 2004 I was lucky to get The Lord of The Rings exhibition. In 2011 it was NCIS. Be sure you check their website to know these special occasion. Of course there is an additional ticket fee for this."
,,Very nice place for Children :),5.0,,"Really nice and must see place for everyone especially young children. There are several science exhibits and also special themed ones. Quite a number of these are interactive which makes for a good learning experience for children.

If your Singapore visit is not a hurried one, advice would be to keep an entire day for this place as it also has Snow city and Omni Theatre within the complex which are also worth seeing.

Global Food Chain McD is also there so fooding is not a problem. Tickets are available on the spot easily. Would recommend you to buy a combo ticket like science centre - snow city, in case you wish to see both as it will cost cheap.

Check their website once for more information as to avoid inconvenience later.

Yearning to visit this place again in near future :)"
,,Fun at the Science centre,5.0,,"There is more than just science at the science centre, with the snow city and the Omni theatre thrown in to make it interesting for the entire family, non-nerds included. However, if you want to focus only on pure science, do limit a whole day to the science centre exclusively. Each exhibition / experiment takes at least 10 minutes to wholly understand if you are a serious science enthusiast. If you are an uninterested playful 8 year old kid, you can run like mad in the various exhibits looking for funky mirrors and buttons to play with. I found the sound section, the exhibit on the fire tornado and the 'mind's eye' very engaging. It is not possible to go through all the exhibits in one go and would require at least 2 days for it. This season, there was a Mega bugs travelling exhibit which had a demo of all the bugs in super size with a background of insect sounds. It was fun overall but the lighting was a bit too low and personally I expected the bugs be even bigger than those exhibited."
,,Not just for the kids...even adults can learn something new here!,5.0,,"Good:
-Friendly ticketing staff.
-Easy to navigate, even without a map!
-Big exhibition space, easy to spend 90 minutes without realising it!
-Ample eateries, such as McDonalds.

Bad:
-Located in Jurong, taking the bus is most convenient way to reach here.
-Pay more to view special exhibitions.
-Ticketing staff tend to up-sell for you to ""waste"" 1 more hour at the IMAX theatre next door."
,,Education & fun simultaneously,5.0,,Visited this place last week with my young & teen age kids. It has things for people of all ages. This place is full of knowledge. It provides information from basic science to complex things like robotics. Visiting this place is an excellent use of your time.
,,Children's Haven,3.0,,"There is a wet play area for children to play especially on a hot day so it is good to bring along swimwear when you go to Science Centre. My 2 boys could easily spend 2 days there as they enjoyed exploring around in different halls that offer different science experiments and demonstrations. Of course, being a children ""play area"", some apparatus are spoiled.I would prefer if they can have more benches for adults to sit while the kids can go wander around. Overall, a good place to go if your children are into science and experiments."
,,Totally worth it,5.0,,"Went during school holiday with kids aged 7 and 2, this place was basically answering their curiosity! My 6 year old can easily relates those exhibits into what she's learning at school, and the wee one was just as excited with the waterworks, sounds, blink-blink, robots, etc. The laser show was amazing, the 3D movie hall was fantastic. Remember to bring a wet suit for the kinetic garden and waterpark. There are McDonald right in front which was helpful to cater the over-excited hungry kids (McD place is too small btw as it was crowded). Allocate at least half a day to get to see everything in the centre, make it a 1 full day if also to experience the nearby indoor snow stadium. Taking MRT to get there is pretty convenience as the place is just wihin working distance from the MRT station."
,,Educational and play,5.0,,"We have visited Science Center twice, still our children were so excited to play and learn many educational displays. The fire tornado exhibition was also amazed our children."
,,great for little explorers!,4.0,,"it's a great way to bond with your kids ( mine is 5 yrs old) over science and over water play. There is a outdoor waterworks which is great to learn about typhoons and trajectory etc.. (One has to go through the main doors of science centre to get into the water works.)

the displays and exhibits are very interesting. a good balance of hands-on together with information, so that even adults are keep interested.

Just the main science centre without the snow city is more than enuf to wear everyone out for a full 4-5 hours! :)

I brought my wheelchair bound grandma too, and it was no problem getting around."
,,"Hands on exhibits, something for everyone, great day out!",5.0,,"We visited the Science Centre hoping to fill an hour or two of our day and ended out staying for over 5 hours! There is simply so much to see and do. The majority of exhibits are hands on and there are a huge number of different areas to keep everyone happy - including optical illusions, , sound, live animals, robotics, DNA and climate change to name just a few. There were shows on throughout the day and we enjoyed watching a fire tornado. The kinetic garden and water park outside made excellent use of outside space and science to make physical fun e.g. lifting 200kg using the concept of a lever. There was also an imax cinema and snow city which we didnt investigate. Definitely recommend for both young and old."
,,A good place to learn science,4.0,,"The science and discovery center is a well organized place devoted to science. It has halls on DNA, Genetics, Robotics, Climate change etc. This is a good place to visit if you are interested in science and want to learn about what science has to offer and how science effects our lives. Good for children and adults.
However, if you going just from a tourist point of view (press some buttons and see some balls jumping), then i would recommend that you skip this.
Also, for vegetarians, there are no eateries around. The only place is Mc donald's where you can eat on Fries and Ice creams"
,,"Great Place, specially if you travelling with children",5.0,,"The Science centre is located closed to snow city and the imax building; you can buy 3 in one ticket to get to all attractions. They all worth a visit!
Not only children can learn a lot in this place; adult will learn a lot too.
You will need a half day at minimum; but I would recommend a full day visit. There's water park where children can play with water while learning. Do bring change clothes; as no children will be able to hold themselves seeing this attraction."
,,A good day out for the kids,4.0,,"I'm not sure what I was expecting but I wasn't expecting the centre to be so focused on children. I went with my husband & we were the only adults there without children.

Nevertheless we did have a good day out that was interesting & informative. The Exhibits are all very interactive & there are regular practical demonstrations of everything from lightening to fire.

So, if you have children, this is a great place to take them where they can have fun & learn.

However, I wouldn't recommend banking on having lunch there. There is 1 restaurant & the choices limited. We therefore didn't dine, my husband just got a hotdog to snack on so we could go somewhere nicer."
,,Science Centre,2.0,,Many of the displays were faulty / not working. Science <> Maintenance? Need to do lots of repair & maintenance to keep the centre in good shape to attract more visitors! We'll give it another try durig the June holidays to see if the condition has improved. :)
,,Plan minimum a half day,5.0,,"Great attraction in Singapore. This is a must for families with kids above 5 years old. My daughter was so excited with all the things to try out.
Dont forget to bring your swim wear for your kids as the water park in front is good physical fun after some hours of cognitive input for the kids.
If you have enough time it seems great to combine your visit with an IMAX show. Prices for combi tickets are better as well."
,,Great fun day,5.0,,We went here with our children 4 and 7 and had fun all day. The fire show was fabulous. All the exhibitions were good and a trip to the IMAX theatre is worth while. From spinning plates to finding out how we will look at 60 were all good fun. The children slept in the taxi on the way home so that is a good sign.
,,Excellent value and fun for all ages,5.0,,"We were 6 inc two kids, one 2 and one 6 plus 2 grandparents. Everyone enjoyed it inc the water park . We also went to the IMAX theatre to see a film which was not a good film about Pandas but was really a pat on the back film for the great Americans who rescued pandas against the evil English hunter , all for San Diego zoo to where a baby Panda was taken from China all for excellent reasons it seems. Notwithstanding the poor plot the theatre is worth a visit and at 17 dollars per adult plus 10 for the 6 year old the whole experience was excellent"
,,Fun trip!,5.0,,"Been a long time since I went to science centre. Brought my two kids age 10 and 6 to allow them to explore the place.

While I still find science boring, my children were captivated by the many hands on and interactive displays that they could play with. We caught the fire tornado demo which was fascinating plus the telstra coil. Place is rather cold so do bring along jackets for the kids. We were there at 2pm and left at closing time of 6pm. Covered most of the areas but didn't manage to catch the shows at omni max. Travelling to the place is pretty easy, from jurong east mrt, took covered walkway, went past Jcube and the library. Admittedly, can be tiring when the weather is hot and you are lugging two children along.

Do make time for the kinetic garden outside after the centre has closed. Food outlets include mcdonald's which is horrifying crowded and a smaller cafe. But can walk back to Jcube for more choices."
,,Something for all the family,4.0,,Wide range of things to do and see here. Good place for an hour or two (per visit - and you will need more than one visit so consider a season ticket if you live in Singapore. We have a Family Season ticket: Note that it only gives you free access to the Science Centre generally – you still have to pay for the special exhibitions though you get a discount. Imax films are free with the season ticket – very enjoyable . This is Singapore’s only dome theatre and has recently been renovated (recarpeted and seats reupholstered). Try to avoid going at the end of a school holiday – the place looks tired and many of the exhibits do not work and need to be fixed after overenthusiastic use by keen children!
,,Fun fun fun,5.0,,"This is the best Science Center that we've ever been to. Went here with the whole family ages range from 3 yo to 60 yo. And everybody had fun! We spent 4-5 hours here, and everybody came out tired but properly science-tified. :)"
,,SUPERCOOL,4.0,,"love it love it love it
you can enjoy this place half a day itself. If you came in the morning you really can spend time seeing / studying all of this very cool science stuff and you can try it all the demo.
There's robotic area, earth area, dna area, virus/bakteria area, and lots lots more intresting stuff in it... you should bring your kids here to learn, take some time to also educate them that science is FUN.

After you are having great time at the museum, you can always try the iceland... not much though, it's very small but the tire slide is must try... don't forget your gloves on"
,,A fantastic family day out,5.0,,"The Science Centre is a real gem of a place. It has been incredibly well designed for children, far surpassing anything I have visited in the UK. There is a fantastic combination of sturdy hands on and moving exhibits to engage all of the family, as well as various scientific programmes and showings throughout the day. The water splash park is a real hit all three of my children.

Over the 4 year period we have visited the centre there has always been a steady turnover in exhibits as well as the old favourites.

The only downside for us has been the limited seating catered for self catering families at meal times. The cafe serves a limited range of food items (I guess because there is a McDonalds right next to the entrance of the Science Centre). However, that said, we always pack a picnic lunch and somehow manage to get seating eventually.

For families intending on staying in Singapore over a year, the annual pass is a real bargain. This is a great place to pop into for a morning on a rainy weekend day!"
,,Very special and interesting place,5.0,,"Worth to spend the whole day there. Lots of things to see, to play and to have fun with. Especially if you go with friends. The most exciting shows are Fire Tornado and Tesla Coil. Try to get inside the cage during the Tesla Coil show, you will have something to impress your friends afterwards.. if you survive. Anyway the experience will be unforgettable.

Some exhibits look shabby and aged. No doubt they need a refurbishment and cleaning. Still it is the best place in Asia where one can have fun with a science."
,,Not Worth the Trek,2.0,,"We visited the Centre because we had plans to do other outdoor activities which were cancelled because of rain. The Centre is kinda out in the middle of nowhere -- Jurong East. It took about 40 minutes by taxi from Sentosa. Be careful to make arrangements when you leave this place, as it may be difficult to find a taxi stand.

The center itself was just OK. I went there with my 7 year old and I think he was mildly entertained. I went to the garden in the back during a break in the rain and that was nice, nothing amazing.

It was probably the only available alternative for a rainy day in Singapore, but I would try to avoid going back there again."
,,Perfect and worth the effort,5.0,,I visited with my 6 & 5 year boys and they were well entertained. >95% of hands on equipment was working and so much to see and do. We still did not have time to everything.
,,Great place for Kids,5.0,,"I was here with my 9 and 11 yo daughters. They really enjoyed and excited in here. They loved the museum, the park and also the Omni Theatre. Thay had fun and learned a lot. We loved it 😊😊"
,,Messy with poor science,2.0,,"I expected a more organized, spacious and informative environment. Very poor in all these categories."
,,watch out for operating hour,4.0,,"For the first time we going to Singapore Science was no more time because operating hour closing at 5 PM and we just arrive at 2 PM. So, for the next day we going there for once again to seen 4D movie. Singapore Science was okey, good to take kiddo. And 4D movie was Great, loves it. Snow City for fun with kids, but not to recommended."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,The science centre is amazing! I spend an easy 5-6 hours there! The experiments/shows were great! All demonstrations are fun. All of them have something you can try out. Definitely worth going! No flaws.
,,Nephew likes dinosaurs!,4.0,,We took our Nephew to visit there. He was very happy to see all the Dinosaurs at the same place. It was great feeling to see him happy out there.
,,Good day out with kids,4.0,,Caught the train and followed the walking directions. Admission special packages are great value. 35th anniversary package of $17 included omni theatre and the science section. $20 included snow city. We had a good time in the exhibits but did not finish them all. There are reasonably priced cafes and a water section. Remember bathers and a towel. You could even shop afterwards at the J cube shopping mall. Cheap eats there.
,,Needs to do more,3.0,,"My son, 19, and I visited the Science Centre last week after a long interval. We have been there many times and always enjoyed our visits and naturally both of us were looking forward to our visit. As my son put it, ‘There is always something new to learn at the Science Centre’.

Sadly the Science Centre was a big disappointment!
- Most of older exhibits are poorly maintained and show their age. The ‘Perpetual Motion Machine’ which greets visitors at the entrance typifies the neglect – couldn’t they at least give it a good wipe?
- The Defence Science Exhibition has a few interesting items, but more is expected. The show at 3.15 which demonstrates the working of a thermal imager is childish and boring. (even the children seemed bored!)
- Overall the place looks run down and downcast. There are no excited children with wows and wahs, no tourists, no older enthusiasts keenly trying to figure out the tricks, just parents dragging their kids around."
,,Singapore for kids,5.0,,"There are many attractions for kids and they are educational. The Singapore Science Centre is one of the good places that kids should not miss. There are lots interactive experiments and small workshops for you to learn science. We joined the electricity show and the sound show. The staffs were friendly and the shows are fascinating! I just wonder why our kids could pay so much attention to the shows for so loooooong time! Even though we spent a whole day there, we thought we didn't get enough time and we had to spare time for the water play area.... Kids enjoy very much the water play area and many parks in Singapore have such play areas (e.g. zoo. bird's park..) It adds much fun!!!"
,,send there by a friend,5.0,,"i was send there by a friend to kill time in sigapore waiting for a new visa. I was not expecting it so good, i send all day from 9am to 5pm there. lots of things to see and great fro childen education. the 360 cinema was really cool and lots of attractin to see, electicity, wind, water, germs,etc.
go there if you want to spend some good money family time"
,,Fun For the children,4.0,,"It was fun for the children, all the exhibits were based on some science on it .... it has varied educational items.... also within the science center there is a snow city where u could experience snow in Singapore"
,,my boys loved it!!!!,5.0,,a little far from the city.....love the sets......my kids loved it ...... lots of activities for big kids and small ones.....I loved it too....
,,Simply Amazing!,5.0,,Took my kids to visit this amazing and very educational place. Was totally awed and amazed at the wondrously varied educational stuffs it has to offer.
,,place with full of amazing stuff if you love science,4.0,,I was there once when i was living in jurong area. The place is full of amazing stuff. Love it. Even think of buying a annual membership but didnt buy it as i moved to the city area..
,,2nd Visit after 22 years,4.0,,"Very enjoyable visit due to the variety of new exhibits. Even the old ones like the Tesla Coil demonstration is still exciting. Defense Revealed (new) however was not to my expectation.
Muslim visitor please take note that the Centre only provide a 2pax prayer room by request at the customer service counter."
,,Lots to do...,5.0,,A great attraction with plenty of hands on displays to look at and interact with. The kids particularly liked getting into their swimming gear and running around in the water park outside the main building. Tip: Don't eat there - food is an overcrowded MacDonalds.
,,New exhibits every few months,5.0,,"They have special talks or presentations during school hols to entertain and teach the young ones. They change their theme and exhibits on regular basis, though there are some they kept for years. But then, the 'old' exhibits are still fun and interesting to play with."
,,Excellent learning & entertainment,5.0,,"Far off from city, ~ 20 SGD by taxi, or go by MRT to Jurong east & walk for 5-6 min.
Numerous scientific displays on earth, sound, light, water, health, defense, microbes.... all in different themed orbits/ areas with explanations.. one day is not enough to see everything."
,,Absolutely awesome!! My third visit and I'd go again!,5.0,,"Loved the science museum! It was my third time but on each occasion you find things you didn't see before, and they're always changing exhibits. The place is huge! It's also located close to imax and the snow centre so you can buy a value pass and go to all 3. IMAX doccos were great!! Overall I'd say it's one of my favourite places in Singapore and well worth the visit! It's a long way from the centre but it's easily accessible by train."
,,Great experience for young and 'old' kids,4.0,,Easy and cheap to get to by rail even though it's out of the city a bit. The place has a central room and then science-themed areas radiating out from there. Each area was dedicated to a different topic and I enjoyed the way it was organised. The best aspect was the hands-on nature of the whole place. My family was very happy with the number and nature of the exhibits and time flew by without us noticing. I agree with another reviewer that the shows should have happened more often but they were good. The Imax theatre formed part of the complex and is worth a visit. We thoroughly enjoyed our day.
,,Family time,5.0,,"A hands on science centre, great fun had by all. All the demonstrations were presented well and a full of information"
,,I'd give this place a miss the next time,3.0,,"Maybe it was an over expectation. The exhibits were dated. This place was more of a science museum. The shows were a bit too short and rather far apart. The Tesla and Fire Tornado were about 3 hours apart. We arrived in the morning and were out in less than 2 hours. There was simply not enough for the kids to do to keep them busy.

When we left, we were surprised there was no taxi stand. This is probably the only attraction in Singapore without one. We could have caught the MRT a short walk opposite, but it was raining. When inquired, we were asked to wait for incoming visitors and grap their taxis!"
,,Good!,4.0,,"Informative. But might need to make things a bit more interesting for kids. If you plan to read every single item, then u might have to come back the next day. We spent around 7 hrs there, but not thoroughly looking at every thing in every booth. We skipped some of them."
,,Kids had a blast,4.0,,"The kids will really enjoy themselves at the Science Centre. All the exhibits are very kid friendly and interactive. The kids generally race from item to item to try them out. Some displays are not that intuitive, and will need detailed reading of the instructions - but generally the kids won't have the patience for that, so the essence behind the display may be lost on the kid. They do need to simplify some of the instructions to make it easier for the kids.

There are special additional exhibits now and then, though there will be extra entrance fees for those. Currently there is the Candy exhibit, which was disappointing. There was so much potential in showing the different chemical reactions that make up so many different types of candy - but it failed to show case that.

The demonstration at the Fire section is really cool, or rather, Hot! The spinning flame really is quite interesting to watch.

There's a fun water play area - remember to bring your swim stuff &/or a change of clothes. There are shower and change facilities available. And outside there is the interactive garden which also has quite a few cool items to explore.

Note - they've started charging for the parking, which may get a bit costly since you're likely to spend more than a couple of hours there if the kids have their way..."
,,Must visit for Kids,4.0,,"Kids so excited to be there. They really enjoyed trying some exhibits. Actually we have to spend more then 3 hours there, but we didn't have enought time. So we only spent around 2 hours there and kids didn't want to leave."
,,Somewhat disappointed,3.0,,This review is on the Science Centre situated near Jurong Park. I was so excited to go because of my love for science but all in all I was disappointed because it seems the whole centre is really geared for children more than for adults. Many of the exhibits also looked worn down and not like the slick shiny installations I've come to expect from first world Singapore. I was hungry when I got there but disappointed to find out the food that was offered was not only limited but also very expensive...relatively speaking. I have no intention of coming back here again unless they completely renovate and change their offerings.
,,Excellent Museum for the whole family,5.0,,"The museum is excellent - lots and lot of interesting exhibits and live science shows. The Fire Tornado and Tesla Coil shows should not be missed. The water play area alone will provide hours of fun - be sure to take swim trunks for the kids. Outside the entrance is a play area that combines science and playground fun! At the back, is a nature area with a tree house. Kids can also see various fruit and vegetable trees. You will need to give a whole day for the visit."
,,Very kids friendly to introduce science,5.0,,"Awesome place to introduce science to kids. First I thought my 3yo boy wouldn't like the centre. But when we arrived there, he didn't want to leave. We spent around 5 hours there. unbelievable!"
,,Learned so much about this world,3.0,,"This is a great place to spend a day, you can get entertained and educated at the same time!! There is a lot to see and experience in here, from the earth to the space includes living with bacteria and virus These all exhibits are interactive and hands-on. We watched the marine life at the omni theater. It was and IMAX dome theater, its kinda like documentaries film but it wasn't boring at all! Make sure you really love science when you go to such a place like this or you can just come and enjoy the Omni theater."
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,Really enjoyed all the exhibits at science centre. Lots of activities for kids to do. Kids especially enjoyed the snow world experience. Reall worth visiting more than once. There is a nice little cafe featuring snacks and food. Kids enjoyed the yummy pancakes and pastas they served.
,,Learning Centre,4.0,,A wonderful place to take children to. There are so many things for them to try and read up. I am fully occupied every time I am there.
,,Interesting,5.0,,"Great for Families, lots to see and do, Harry potter exhibition and Andy Warhol were great! With shopping and eaterys close by its worth a visit!"
,,Amazing and Full of fun,4.0,,"Must See: Tesla Coil demonstration, Exhibition on human body, Mathematics in real life, Science of Light and Sound. Great place for children of all ages to enjoy. Lots of hands on learning activities.
Do carry a spare set of clothes if you want to enjoy fun in splash park located right at the entrance.
Omni Max located 5 min walk is also a great add-on.
On public holidays Science Center gets slightly crowded. You may plan your visit accordingly."
,,"Hands-on experiences, cool Tesla Coil show",4.0,,"I visited with my 3 primary-school kids, and spent 3 hours at the Science Centre. We could only complete three quarters of the centre (and we hadn't even visited the Omni Theatre). The hands-on exhibits, the easy access for children of all ages (and heights), the huge water themed splash zone (don't forget to get your swimwear) and the Tesla Coil show at 12:00 noon, were all very enjoyable parts of our Science Centre visit."
,,useful tip to reach the center,3.0,,"take mrt from ur station to jurong east and then take bus 335 from opposite the station.It drops u opposite the science center. Fastest and cheapest mode to reach.
Take combo pass to c the 3 option at that place.
However i was disappointing as my previous visit in 2005 has many more exhibits, this time was disappointing."
,,Fun With Science,3.0,,"Located in the west, Science Centre Singapore is proof that, yes, learning science can be fun!

Even before stepping into Science Centre Singapore, there is plenty to see and do at the Kinetic Garden. Kids will have fun playing with the various exhibits available. Some exhibits demonstrate science that is difficult to replicate indoors.

Just beyond the main entrance of Science Centre Singapore, the exhibit Mind's Eye features a mind-boggling display of various optical illusions. Don't forget to climb the 3 stories of stairs, as the exhibition extends up there too!
Beyond this lies one of two main attractions of Science Centre Singapore, the Tesla Coil. Do catch the daily Tesla Coil demonstrations at either 12pm or 5pm.
Around the Tesla Coil, several interactive exhibits are available, as well as the entrances to the rest of the exhibition halls.

Hall A at Science Centre Singapore has 2 permanent exhibitions. i-SPACE showcases the history and science behind info-communications technologies, while Uniquely You explains how genes and lifestyle make us special.
Scientist For A Day is an interactive enrichment activity conducted by Science Centre Singapore staff. A daily guided tour is available at 11.30am and 3.30pm.
Kids can play and cool-off at the Waterworks, a water themed play-area with fountains, waterfalls, jets and more.
Finally, the temporary exhibit House Of Blood, held in partnership with the Singapore Red Cross Society, is on display throughout 2012. It explains all about the science behind blood.

The Bioethics exhibition at Hall B of the Science Centre Singapore raises thought-provoking questions on balacing scientific progress with morality and responsibility towards others. In line with this theme, the Genome exhibit traces the basics, application and modification of genetics, while the Living With Viruses exhibit examines some of the viral infections that are issues both worldwide, and in Singapore.
In the other half of Hall B, Earth Our Untamed Planet examines the ecological conditions of our planet, as well as the cause of natural disasters. In line with this theme, the Climate Change exhibit showcases the impact of global warming, and environmentally friendly technologies being developed.

Hall C of the Science Centre Singapore focuses on examining the science behind sound and hearing. The majority of exihibits here are interactive and fun! Also, catch the Sound Show at 11am (Daily) and 4pm (Weekdays Only). The last demonstration of the visual representation of sound is very interesting!

Halls D and E of the Science Centre Singapore are the temporary exhibition halls. Currently, it houses the Live Animals And Insects exhibit, as well as the Candy Unwrapped exhibit.
Outside, visitors can explore the Ecogarden, which has a variety of Plant exhibits. Don't miss the Rubber Centenery Monument, which explains the cultivation of rubber in Southeast Asia, and photo-taking opportunities at the TreeHouse.

The Mathematics Everywhere & Everyday exhibition at Hall F showcases the history and application of maths. Don't miss the reality distorting Ames Room, or try solving the 7 Millennium Problems, each of which carry a USD $1 million cash prize!

Head towards the Annexe, and you'll come across the Marine Alcove exhibit and the Fire exhibit. At the Fire exhibit, be sure to catch the other main attraction of Science Centre Singapore, the Fire Tornado. The Fire Tornado demonstration takes place only once daily, at 3pm.
The Annexe houses temporary special exhibitions, which charge an additional admission fee, separate from the Science Centre Singapore admission fee. Currently, the exhibitions include Sultans Of Science (SGD $12) and Bio-Rhythm (SGD $8).

The second level of the Science Centre Singapore has the Robotics exhibition. I found the schematic diagrams of Wall-E and R2D2 quite fascinating.
Hall G is also located here, and houses the exhibition Invent! It's In You! I liked the Inventors Spotlight, as well as the Reflect exhibit.

While I enjoyed my visit and the numerous exhibits, I felt slightly overwhelmed. There's so much to see and do, that even after 8 hours, I couldn't completely view everything!
If you're planning a visit, note that admission fees can cost up to $9, and allocate around 4 to 8 hours for viewing.
Also, plan your trip in advance, especially if you want to catch some of their live demonstrations."
,,Enjoyable educational tour,4.0,,A place to be when you have children. They can get to have hands-on experience to alot of games provided. Adults also get to refresh their science knowledge.
,,An ok place for the family,3.0,,"We went to the Science center after we went to Snow City which is next door. The science center has many hands on activities you and the kids can do. Kids can run around and play with the many things that they have. There is even an outside play area which is free. There are many areas such as on biology, physics, astronomy, space and surprisingly a history of science section. The only let down is that some of the activities are broken and jas not been repaired. Some place are just too dark and frightens little children. There are also no one to ask for help as most of the assistants are busy at the entrance. As a result no one is on hand to help you in case you get lost inside. The amazing Tesla electrical show comes on at certain times but we didn't know when as there was no one to ask its schedule. All in all, a lot of exhibits and activities some in areas where there is little light. There is also one Macdonalds restaurant but it was mostly crowded during school holidays."
,,Science Alive,4.0,,interesting interactive exhibitions. A no. of scientifc demos made it exciting for the young ones. Interactive exhibits not just inside but outside too. Would be good to have more food available at the Science Centre.
,,Childhood place,3.0,,"My childhood place, always come here every year, starting from Primary school. Brings back memories"
,,Not to learn but to love science,5.0,,"Even if you're not a science lover, you'll be after visiting this place. Here you'll learn how things work in the world around us. There are around 850 interactive exhibits here. don't miss the Kinetic Garden, a unique outdoor play ground outfitted with toys such as an energy machine, water maze, and solar fountain."
,,Hands-on Learning for the Whole Family,4.0,,"This was a nice place to visit with our 6 y.o. daughter. It was a very hands-on learning experience for her (and for her parents as well!). There are so many exhibits that you need a whole day to really go through the whole thing. There were some exhibits that were under repair as well. If you have young kids, bring a swimsuit and a change of clothes because there is a nice water playground. You might also want to opt to watch the imax movie. Generally, it's a nice place to spend the day. We got there by taxi. If you are 3 pax or more, this is probably the quickest and most practical way to get there. Getting a taxi from there is also not a problem."
,,educational and fun,5.0,,"pretty amazing, but not worth going twice because the toys are the same"
,,Singapore Science Centre,4.0,,"Very interesting and informative for both adult & children. My niece, nephew and sisters enjoyed it"
,,Awakens the science around us...,3.0,,"Certainly a venue to go to for science...for everyone especially children. Prepare to spend at least 3/4 or 1 day to cover the exhibits. Start early. Plenty of showtimes for various themes around the clock. Do make time to catch an iMax movie, available on reduced price packaged price for family or iMax/Science Centre combo. Bring along swimming costume for children for water theme park just outside the centre. Meals avail at the McDonalds fastfood chain or cafe within the centre. Parking is free but will be a challenge to get a space especially weekends and public holidays. MRT (Jurong East) requires a 15min walk to the centre...not good especially if weather is hot or rainy."
,,Science Centre,3.0,,All the fixtures are a little worn and tired. It's good for a visit.
,,Lots of fun for self-admitted geeks like me!,4.0,,"Learning is fun! And if you're one of the people who think this way, then you'd enjoy this place!

I love the Mind's Eye Gallery! We spent most of our time there, literally going thru almost every exhibit. Love it!

I was actually kind of disappointed at the Tesla Coil Show because I've heard raves about it. It was interesting but not ""wow"". What ""wowed"" me was the Omni-Theatre! It was my first time in a dome-shaped theatre and that big! We were seated at the topmost row and it was great! Warning: this is for people who love Discovery and Nat Geo type of shows. If you're not one, then you might get bored, or even fall asleep. But as for me, I literally said ""wow!"" the moment i saw the top-view shot of the islands. We watched ""Coral Reef Adventure"".

I would have given this 5 stars had there been very few broken/under maintenance exhibits. However, there were quite a number of non-working exhibits that I can't give 5 stars. But the TOTAL number of exhibits was so many that it still deserves 4 stars (in my opinion) even though there were non-working ones. I hope they could fix and upgrade. Also, I hope that the exhibits would be for 9 years old up only, because younger kids were just playing with them and they won't understand it yet at that age - i literally saw young kids playing carelessly with some of the exhibits thus the reason why there are broken ones."
,,science center,3.0,,Cool! so much things to play. spend half of my day inside
,,super fun!!!,4.0,,"Honestly, i was a bit skeptical about this place. I thought it was just like an ordinary museum with lots of kids playing around with their family, since the snow city is right next door. But then apparently, it was super fun even for young adult / adult. Even the simplest science can be very very interesting for experienced. Would definitely recommend this place :)"
,,Excellent for kids young (and a little older),5.0,,"I love this place, my kids love this place, my wife loves this place. It's family fun, interesting facts and a great day out all rolled into one.

We have a 2 year membership to this place, it was relatively inexpensive and the whole family get to go to the Omni Cinema and the main Science centre for an unlimited amount of time for the entire 2 years. It's been very worthwhile.

The Omni Theatre (large indoor dome screen showing IMAX movies) has a new screen since we joined and has improved the experience greatly, there are no visable seems now and you can enjoy the movie without the worry, my kids love it and always ask ""are we flying dad"" when the films start big swooping shots.

The main Science Centre has a number of long standing shows and exhibits throughout that they do maintain very well, as you can imagine, hundreds of kids a day are hitting buttons, whizzing whizzers and generally utilising things to virtual destruction, so there are times when things are not working 100%, but they soon get to fix them for the next visit.

They have an annex that (for an additional price) you can look at a large exhibit on a particular topic of science and this is normally very good. They change this exhibit every few months, the schedules of this and the film changes on the theatre are published on the webpage.

There is a great fact filled learning water play area, with all kinds of attractions for little ones, remember to take the swim suits and towels, there doesn't seem to be any availability of this in the shop, but, there are suitable changing rooms.

All in all, I'd have to say if you want a bang for buck attraction for the whole family in Singapore then this is it!"
,,My kids love it!,5.0,,"I have been here a number of times, and never seen it all. The kids love it, its there favorite place in Singapore on the weekend. Make sure you see some of the shows which are really good - and bring your swimming gear as the outside water play area is great. Highly recommended for families with kids age 3 to 16."
,,Fun,5.0,,"This is very fun, there is lots of things to do, since Snow CIty is close, if you get bored at Science Centre you can go there!"
,,Science Center,3.0,,Should have new exhibitions and attractions. The attractions are the same when I visited it ten years ago and now.
,,"Fabulous museum, but not toddler-friendly",4.0,,"This is a great science museum for older children, age 7-8 and above. The scientific explanations are excellent and there are a ton of cool exhibits. But very little to keep our 3 and 5 year olds entertained on a rainy morning. Bring a change of clothes - the ""water"" exploration zone gets more than a little wet."
,,Hidden gem!!!,5.0,,"The Singapore Science Centre must be one of Singapore's best hidden gems. Its a little difficult to access and there are no proper directions once u alight at Jurong East, but its actually a very short walk to the Science Centre. Its suitable for all ages and my 9 year old had a blast. Infact children of all ages were having a great time - touching, seeing or simply just observing and taking in the atmosphere! We must have reached there by around 11 and we didnt want to leave until closing time!

The exhibits / experiments were great, interesting, amusing and hands-on. We especially enjoyed The eye's mind, sound, fire, weather, planet earth - all were superb! Managed to catch a couple of shows - one on balloons and another one on dinosaurs at the Omni Theatre and both were superb! The hurricane and earthquake experience were fantastic too!

Very few exhibits / experiments didn't work and thats surprising considering that this is Singapore! However nothing to take away the 5 stars that this attraction deserves :)

Overall, its a great place to open your child's mind to science and have them feel, touch, question and experience the wonderful world of science.

There was a McDonalds and another cafe on site - not much to choose there! Saw a lot of toddlers having a blast in the water play area just outside!

I am not at all a science buff but even I came back suitable impressed, amused and entertained!

A must visit - allocate a full day!!!"
,,A good experience,4.0,,"Very nice architecture with many good expositions. Try to see what they are exposing before you go but if tou like museums , this is a must go place at least for pictures from outside if you are not interested in what they are showing,"
,,Dated and tired,3.0,,"The place's main exhibits need a revamp. It has to decide whether it should cater to school groups or really explore and showcase cutting-edge science and technology. This dithering of identity does not help the place. Little has changed since I visited as a student and now, as a parent myself. That does not bode well for a place that talks about science and innovation. On the good side, if you have kids just starting out to learn about science concepts, this is a good place to start with. The water park is a hit with the kids too, especially on a hot day."
,,Allot more time for this,4.0,,"The center is huge, that we have to allot a lot of time to visit all its offering. We also watched a 3d movie at the theater with a dome. Schedules of experiments are printed at the map. It was a fun learning experience!"
,,kids will really enjoy,5.0,,"As first time visiting to Singpaore Science Centre, my kids really enjoy it. 3 hours not enough for them to explore all of it. But really a bit tiring for parents and grandparent but feel worth it when the kids can learn more about science. Luckily, there are some chair for us to sit and relax our tiring legs. When hungry, there is McDonald and icecream booth called New Zealand Nature with some simple other food like waffles, etc.

We took the singapore science centre + Imax package costing SGD16 per adult and SGD10 per kid. But they fall asleep during watching the Imax movies show, as not interesting to them. They still prefer the singapore science centre and bought some souvenir back too."
,,Excellent place for the whole family,5.0,,"We could have spent the whole day here! There were lots of interactive exhibits that were really educational. Kids and adults would have a grand time here. Best to go early, as there can be big groups of students that will be running around. Reasonably priced too!"
,,Singapore Science Centre,3.0,,"Whilst the Singapore Science Centre is still an attractive venue for tourists and the general public to be honest its looking a bit tired these days. Most of the exhibits are functioning but many now have a very care worn look. The building itself has not benefited from the dazzling development of its city centre counterparts, and overall one gets the feeling that it has missed the big budget upgrades that it is probably longing for. Despite this one can see that effort has been made to manage the exhibit areas and there are some new additions to the galleries including a very detailed earth sciences display that is well put together.
All in all i would say it makes for a good venue if you have kids but it may not deliver the real impact that more discerning visitors look for in their science centre experience."
,,Needs refurbishment,2.0,,"Took my nephew and nieces to the Singapore Science Museum uring our Xmas trip to Singapore. I had fond memories of this museum as child. Unfortunately this time around, the place looks like it hasn't changed much from the last time I got there...some 15 years ago.

Most of the exhibits at the main building aren't working as it should and some are not simply out of order. Such a sorry state and it was almost disappointing to have made the MRT journey over.

On the bright side, it is still catered to educate kids. They do have visiting exhibits that are newer (for an additional fee) - on this trip it's Dinosaur Live!

The omni-theater is really run down. Nothing like it's glory days of the 90s.
I recommend 2 hours to take your time to see all the exhibit...if you don't mind coming across a few broken or neglected ones.

Another plus is having a McDonald's onsite - real easy to treat the kids."
,,Learning Science Just Got Easier,4.0,,"If you're a parent looking for a fun and easy way for your kids to learn science, then Science Centre Singapore is the place for you & your kids.

The place offers a lot of intersting exhibits, interactive displays and dynamic shows that both kids and adults will enjoy. They tackle various topics such as Climate Change, Earth, Space, Sound, Robotics, Genome, Diversity, Techonology and Innovations, etc.

I think the place is appropriate for 7year old kids to adults. Toddlers and Pre-Schoolers may not appreciate it that much yet except for the small waterpark called Waterworks. But then again, it's ok to expose them to science at an early age.

Getting there by car or cab is, of course, easier. Just check the website for directions. For those taking the train, the Jurong East MRT Station is really a short distance walk. It doesn't look like it in the map, but it really is an 8-10min walk. As for those taking the bus, the bus stop is just right across the SCS. As for me and my family, we paid the cab $8 from Buena Vista MRT Station to SCS on a non-peak hour time.

We didn't follow any of the suggested itineraries they have online because I felt it was too packed. We just checked the timing of the shows we wanted to see and just went where the kids were interested to explore. It's doubtful that you'd be able to see all the shows they offer in one day (including Snow City). There are so many things to learn, see and discover at the Science Centre Singapore. Definitely, you would want to bring your kids here more than once.

This brings me to the Admission Fees. I strongly suggest families to get the Cosmic Adventurer Membership Scheme. It's $128/year for 2 Adults and 3 Kids with unlimited admission to the Science Centre and 40mins iMax Movies.

Overall, I highly recommend this place to kids, tweeners and adults. Learning Science just got easier thanks to Science Centre Singapore."
,,Just an average,3.0,,"As this trip is a family trip - school holidays, so for kids to have fun. it is a bit boring for me. I think Malaysia's scince centre and Petrosains in KLCC is better."
,,My Toddler loves it!,4.0,,"Like most Science center, this place contains a variety of educational displays about science. My toddler loved the magic mirror, our face image captured on camera and then it will be given a funny patch on the screen. There were also play areas such as slide and playhouse.

If you are traveling with young children, do not forget to try the 'water works' which located next to the building science center. The entrance was after the entrance of the science center (we must have the entrance ticket). When this place have a little visitors, they usually lock the 'water works'. But we've asked them to let us in when it was locked, and they allowed us. So our toddler was very pleased playing with water fountain, water gun, etc, there."
,,Fun for kids!,4.0,,"Fascinating place for kids and boy do they love it! All the gadgets and rooms full of wonders.. they dont want to leave! Great job by the management as nothing has been left wanting here. Places for refreshment, strollers, restrooms.. whatever you may want. Although the tickets are a bit pricey, there are good deals and definitely worth it when you see the wonder on the little ones' faces!"
,,Not great for younger kids,4.0,,"The science museum was nice, but difficult with a mix of kids. There is very little for age 4."
,,Fun for kids and adults,5.0,,Great place to spend the day with young kids and to find out how things were made or created. Its a fun and educational place with hands on activities for kids
,,Great place for kids to explore,5.0,,A great place to bring your kids to open up their curious minds and adventurous hearts. They will surely enjoy what is on offer here. There is also a macdonald's within the compound.
,,Enjoyable for kids but...,3.0,,It was a very educational place covering what a typical science center needs to cover. However there were some exibits that neede updating and repair. What made it well worth the trip was the Tesla electricity show and the sound center.
,,Pesky kids,2.0,,"Primary school kinds calmly cut queue when you are queuing to try on an interactive exhibit. You get annoyed but think- oh well, when he is done, I will get my turn- you can't be more wrong. Kid in question calls his friends to join in & you get pushed further & further to the back of the queue. Kids, where are your manners?"
,,Perfect for families!,5.0,,"I went to the Science Centre with my brother's family. He had an 8 year old, a 6 year old, and a 3 year old. The kids had so much fun with the hands-on experiences."
,,Good for the young ones,3.0,,"The kids voted for this ahead of the Underwater World on Sentosa, and I think it was not a good decision! This place is okay, and for Singapore reasonably priced. And the kids actually seemed to really enjoy the exhibits and activities. But for the adults it is only marginally entertaining. There are lots of options like a Dinosaurs exhibit, IMAX movie theatre, and Snow City. Snow City might be fun if you're from a hot country but we didn't bother as we had snow at our house last year! This place is an easy walk from the Jurong East MRT station - don't take the bus from the MRT. You probably need a good 3-4 hours to explore properly and we had only a short time. If you're taking kids take their swimming costumes as there is a water play area."
,,Educative Tour,4.0,,"Perhaps not as entertaining as the Universal Studio and tucked away in another corner of the island, the centre never fail to wow the young and old with new ideas and gadgets. As how it is being named, it never fail to provide entertainment and at the same time educate the visitors with new knowledge. I thought it is a job well done for the past few decades at least."
,,Attractive,5.0,,"3-4 hours isn't enough for this Science Centre! We were given that much time to tour the vicinity and it JUST WASN'T ENOUGH! They also hold seminars there sometimes, with people from all over the world lecturing."
,,Good for a rainy day,4.0,,I would have ticked Excellent except for the fact that there are always plenty of exhibits that don't work which is why it only got a Very Good. But kids will love it as it is very interactive. Lots of different areas and an outside water play area so take swimming costumes if you go when it is not raining.
,,Worth a visit!,4.0,,"It is definitely one of the better science centres we have been to. Variety of the exhibits is really good. We specially liked Mathematics and 'Uniquely You' sections. We attended couple of shows which gave good insight into Science of Science! Though some of the exhibits were either not working or explanation not enough for everyone to understand them fully.

If you have inquisitive children, plan for good time for exhibits (almost entire day). Other attractions like IMAX & nearby Snow city can be parked for a future date.

One caution: F&B facilities are highly inadequate. McDonalds is always too crowded and Tolido's cafe need to improve their service efficiency."
,,Dinosaurs Live,3.0,,Went to see the Dinosaurs Live there - that was great. The rest of the centre is interesting but needs a little work. Some exhibits not working.
,,A whole day of activities,5.0,,"It's good for family with young kids as there are a lot of things for the kids to explore here. From dinosaurs to robots, science with wind, water and sound...etc."
,,Absolutely worth it!,5.0,,"A great place to spend an afternoon. Definitely one of the best science centers in the world. It's pretty big so if you have an inquisitive mind and are on the quest for knowledge then a the visit would probably require a whole day or at least a few hours. It's got the main hall where all the basic science stuff is on display; a dinosaur-live hall where you can see very life-like dinosaurs moving and making sounds; and a stunning state-of-the-art dome theater where you can watch up to two documentaries per visit.
A must if you are visiting Singapore."
,,Brilliant time,4.0,,We went there mainly for the CSI experience. Overall it was a fab fun day out with the family we thoroughly enjoy ourselves. A lot of interesting things to explore. Will definitely recommend!
,,A Great Day out,4.0,,"What a lovely way to spend the day, there is so much to see and learn at the science centre, from witnessing lightening and the faraday cage to seeing how bacteria lives and thrives, there are also lots of fun hands on activities and optical illusions to keep all age groups amused and a lovely garden outside to relax and see some of natures medicines."
,,We can't wait to go back,5.0,,"I wish I had known about the Singapore Science Centre earlier! The SSC is the answer to any parent's prayer for good, worthwhile, kid-friendly entertainment that does not require purchase of useless merchandise or involve brain-dumbing activities (sorry, the commercialism and consumerism at Universal Studios was just a little too much). Going to the SSC was an excellent and memorable experience that my kids absolutely loved, and there was just so much to do! One afternoon is so not enough to explore all the exhibits! I myself was so busy and engrossed with all the interesting stuff on display that we barely took any pictures. I wished I had also brought swimsuits with us for the kids to play at the water park outside, which looked really inviting. We were also not able to find time for the Snow City next door. There should definitely be a next time for this!

Going there was also quite a breeze, from the Jurong East MTR we simply walked to the nearby bus station and took a 10-minute ride. Going back home, though, we couldn't find the bus station so we had to walk all the way back to the MTR station. It wasn't that far anyway -- around 15 minutes' walk from across the street, and there were many helpful people who gave us directions.

If you have small grade school age kids or even preschoolers, the SSC will provide them a wonderful, enriching and amazing time of learning and discovery. The exhibits are fun and educational, very well-maintained, and chock-full of interesting facts. They have seasonal exhibits as well and 3-d feature film. A definite must on your itinerary!"
,,A place for the little ones,3.0,,"If you have kids, this is a place that you must visit. A lot of stuff for them to explore. Definitely worth the visit!"
,,So much to see and do not enough time!,5.0,,"I and my two little boys - 8 and 5 - went to this attraction, still slightly jet lagged and they protesting the whole way there against doing 'educational' things during school holidays. It was fantastic! From firing canons at pirates, to fire tornadoes, to space,water and bionic human engineering!!! It really is a science centre with a buzz - electricity covered too! Oldest son enjoyed learning about the chemistry of attraction and the youngest had a hilarious time in front of a simulated human body which copied his every move! We also visited the current temporary exhibit ""Dinosaurs Live"" which has amazing, life size interactive, noisy dinosaurs. This is one of the most exiting science museums we've visited, with indoor and outdoor activities. It's lively, big and is very well maintained. Talks and demonstrations are ongoing thoughout the day, and there are lots of helpful staff around to answer questions. Useful tips for tourists: for us the most important was the it is very easy to get to and from by taxi (it is also near the train and bus services.) It's worth taking a change of clothes or swimsuits for kids if you take them to the brilliant outdoor water garden! There is a MacD at the entrance and a more local style cafe inside the centre. We will be back!"
,,Family fun,4.0,,A very good science museum for the whole family with tons of things to do and look at (easy to get your lunch as well since McD is just outside the door. Bring you swimming trunks and go wild in the water park. Some of the exihibits feel a bit old but seems to be slowly switch out so my review might already be slightly outdated.
,,A good change from shopping for the kiddies,4.0,,"Just a S$15 taxi ride from Orchard Rd, this is a multiple attraction centre for the kids, with the 8-gallery Science Centre, IMAX theatre and Snow City all adjoining each other: you can purchase a family pass that encompasses all 3. They have programs right through the day to keep the children occupied - on the day we visited, there was a Sound Show at 11am, Tesla coil at noon, Santa's Toy Factory at 1pm, Insectmania at 2pm, Fire Tornado Show at 3pm and Take to the Skies at 4pm. We couldn't fit everything in, as we watched a 3D ""Flying Monsters"" IMAX movie and the touring live dinosaur exhibition. They allow a pass-out via a UV visible stamp which is handy to grab lunch at McDonalds located at the entrance. Both kids (10 & 7) enjoyed the break from Orchard Rd shopping, in air-conditioned comfort on a rainy day."
,,Skip it!,1.0,,We were extremely disappointed in this museum. It is depressing. Nearly half of the exhibits did not work. The building is worn and smells Iike mildew. Science museums should be inspiring. It was a waste of money.
,,Perennial Favourite For My Son,5.0,,Well explained and functioning exhibits. Well displayed. Constantly refreshed displays. There are also new science talks and workshops. The Fire Cyclone is not to be missed. Another world class attraction in Jurong.
,,Spend a Full Day Here!,5.0,,"The exhibits are very engaging, informative and well thought out. I took a package that includes an IMAX show and it was great. Go early and spend the entire day here. At least the kids can have fun and learn something at the same time."
,,Titanic,5.0,,We went to this exhibition and it was excellent telling the history of the Titanic
,,Terrible condition,1.0,,Pros (1) Lots of exhibits. Most fasinating to me were the hatching chicks. Cons (1) In terrible condition. Not been well maintained. Looks really old and worn. A number of exhibits do not work. (2) Other science museums are better
,,Kids love this place...,4.0,,"I went there with my family aa few times, and the kids LOVED it. They kept runnung in and out of this "" bowl of fruits "" that you can poke your head out from the inside and all the parents on the outside would be so "" shocked "" that their children are in the bowl. My brother is the one that found that out. I am telling you, if you ever, ever go to the Singapore scince centre with kids, GO TO THE BOWL OF FRUITS!!!! >.<"
,,Interesting,3.0,,"I found it interesting at first. A little bit far from Chinese Garden MRT Station, there's a nearest way to get here, by bus, but I don't know the route. With S$10, it's worthed to visit. We can get more knowledge here. Unfortunately, when I went here on January, there was a renovation so I can't enter some areas. It's suitable for young adult, not only the children. An interactive way to widen our knowledge about science and life."
,,One of the best I've seen,5.0,,"I'm practically a science centre professional, and Singapore's is awesome. There is too much to do on one visit, which is always good. You really feel you got your money's worth. There's a real variety of exhibits too, some very simple and some astoundingly high-tech.

There is a fantastic outdoor water science play area, so if you're bringing kids, bring their swim suits. Mine would have happily spent the whole afternoon just in this section."
,,Great for kids with the various displays,4.0,,"We went to see the Dinosaur World - scared my 3 and 5 year old to death.. which wasnt quite what we expected. Still better than the Shark exhibition they had a couple months back - though that was good also
Lots of things for the Kids to see and do"
,,good clean family fun and educational too!,4.0,,This is a good place for kids under 14 to really enjoy along with their parents. I don't think kids over 13 or 14 would enjoy it and would be bored. Clean and tidy and good value. Catch a taxi there though and go to the snow centre next door while there as its quite a distance from the cbd and Orchard Rd areas.
,,Excellent for kids,4.0,,Wondering how to keep the kids happy while you're in Singapore? This is a great place to visit. We arrived at 10am opening time and had to be thrown out at 6pm...
,,This is a plce to go if u r inqusitive,4.0,,"Awesome place with lot of facts, practicals, displays, activities. If one is really enthusiast about knowing things u may need the whole day to complete ur journey through science center. And if you can make it on public holidays or weekends, they have a lot of activities and shows planned which are realy worth watching. But if you r not such a person who want to put pressure on brain then please avoid this place."
,,Excellent place for family,5.0,,Had been to the science centre on a previous trip to Singapore and thoroughly enjoyed it. As it had been awhile since our last visit decided to go back and visit it. Delighted that we did. Spent a very happy 4 hours pottering around . Some of the shows that they did were well worth the wait highly entertaining and educational as well.
,,Fun for kids,4.0,,"if you have kids with you, take them here to join some science shows and funny games here. 9$ for entry ticket/ adult"
,,Fun for the kids and good value,4.0,,"I spent a full Saturday there this weekend with my two kids (8 and 4). They loved the place. We all enjoyed the ""Flying Monsters"" IMAX movie and the other live shows there (don't miss the super-loud Tesla coil demonstration), but just as other reviewers pointed out, the rest of the exhibits are definitely geared toward kids.

And anybody knows that enough kids pounding,beating and climbing on things will inevitably cause stuff to break. The only negative I saw during our day was the large number of broken or completely out-of-order exhibits. The kids didn't mind because there were so many other things to do, but it struck me as a bit too much neglected maintenance.

The water park was a huge hit for my kids and so was the kinetic park outside the admission gates. If you're taking children during an afternoon, save the kinetic park for after closing time (6PM). It's a good way to burn off that last bit of kid energy."
,,Fun Place for Kids,5.0,,A edutainment centre created for kids and teenagers to learn more about science and the magic of science using fun methods. Must go for people of all ages there might be something to learn. Besides there is McDonalds outlet closeby if you are really starving add to that you can enjoy a lot of different dishes at Jurgon Mall Food Court.
,,A great way to entertain the children.,5.0,,"Adults and children alike can easily spend a whole day here and enjoy every minute. There is so much to see and do, most of which is educational."
,,Wonderful!,5.0,,This is a wonderful hands-on science museum. Bring bathing suits for the Water Garden. You can shower afterwards in the bathroom next to it. It has both a cafe and a McDonald's.
,,amazingly fun,5.0,,"we have been here half a dozen times now and still not seen everything. My 2 boys (aged 6 and 9) love everything about it. There are loads of hands on things to experiment with and it never seems to be crowded - even when there are school parties it is big enough to find a quieter area. There is small water play area and a large eco garden as well as a kinetic garden with water wheel, archimedes screw etc. On our latest visit we learned about viruses and enjoyed the fire tornado which we had not seen before. There are several places to eat and a good (although expensive shop). We find this science centre much more enjoyable than petrosians in KL, but more expensive. As we are not singapore residents we have been unable to join as members, but have recently joined petrosians for much less, and which gets us in free."
,,A good place to keep young children entertained.,3.0,,"We went with our 3+ and 6+ year olds and they had a great time going from one exhibit to another. They enjoyed ""waterworks"" most where they spent a good amount of time playing there and getting wet so remember to bring a spare change of clothes for them.

For us adults we find it a little tiring because the exhibits are arranged haphazardly with exhibits all over the place like a spider web. With 1000 interactive exhibits it was impossible to go through all of them so plan your route wisely. Found the Science Centre interesting but could be better maintained as some exhibit did not seem to work. Overall it is a good place to go to keep your young children busy."
,,It's not scientific enough.,3.0,,"I went there last March and I thought it would be pretty much a learning place for the children.However,we were not interested with the display and went back with disappointment.It was not the first time we went and it seemed that the display are of the same.The movie screening at Omnimax threatre was not interesting enough.The children dozed off right at the start of the movie.It would have been better if they can more interactive materials on display and movies that are suitable for all age groups."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"We had a terrific time here. There was so much to see and do (particularly when compared to the science centre we were used to back home!), and we couldn't see/do everything we wanted to in the half day we were there. It was very easy to get there by public transport (MRT, then short bus trip). The CSI exhibit was on while we were there - it was absolutely crowded, but the exhibit itself was so engaging that we didn't mind. The science centre itself wasn't overly busy. Very reasonable entry fee."
,,Good place for kids to learn and explore,4.0,,"Science Centre is a place suitable for young children, not really for adults and teenagers. It is a good place to introduce to young children to get them interest in science and explore. You could be there for half or full day depending on the kids interest. Food is limited. The place is air-con so kids will be more settle down.
It can be crowded during the children school holidays. But it is a place the kids will enjoy."
,,GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY,4.0,,"Spent 4 hours here with 2 adults & 2 children aged 2 & 4. a FANTASTIC time was had by all. Lot's of hands-on stuff for everyone. You can purchase extra tickets for the Imax etc but we didn't bother as there was more than enough to do. We didn't even get around the whole thing.
Prices are VERY reasonable & you can take in prams & own food which can only be eaten in desegnated areas.
Things not to be missed with young kids. Discovery zone/kinetic garden & waterworks--a GREAT outdoor water playground. You can take the kids swimming stuff or let them go in, in their clothes.
Couldn't find any food place to eat but fortunetly we had snacks with us. There is a McDonalds directly outside which is open until 7p.m. Science center closes at 6.
We took a taxi as easier with 2 prams etc but the MRT stops close by.
Would HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
,,FUN & EDUCATIONAL PLACE FOR KIDS ALSO ADULTS,4.0,,"Good facilities and love the planetarium movies as well really hard to go home,really like it there. cool place highly rec"
,,Once is good enough,4.0,,"The Place looks hi-tech, modern & clean. Enjoyed the myriad of themes & activity interactions. The internal premise can be congested when large crowd move in & can be unpleasant. Not much choices for eateries. Would never return unless new activities are created."
,,"Good, if you've never been to a science center before",3.0,,"The science center was quite fun for my nephew (7) and niece (11). They enjoyed playing with the various things in the courtyard (don't miss the parabolic dish that allows you to speak normally about 50 metres apart). The illusions and other hands on stuff proved quite entertaining.

Unfortunately, most of the cool demonstrations are available at limited times (e.g. tesla coil only at 12pm and 5pm). So do check the schedule to make sure you don't miss the demos due to an Imax show. Once you buy the tickets, you're not allowed to change them, as I unhappily found out. The Imax theatre is impressive and well-maintained, but the shows seem aimed towards teenagers. The Hubble show I watched had a lot of dialogue about repair of the telescope and not enough about stars.

The mass communications/IT exhibit was a disgrace. They should have just cordoned off the area instead of allowing people to try broken equipment and explore a mostly empty floor. The hands free equipment they had for controlling computers was already obsolete (due to kinect).

Other exhibits were very wordy and limited to big posters and computer screens, which was quite disappointing. If I wanted to read from a computer screen, I could have used wikipedia.

For people who wish to see dinosaurs, there are none here. In short, the place is entertaining for about 2-3 hours, and good for people who have not been to places like the British Museum, the Museum of Natural Sciences in the US or the Exploratorium in San Francisco."
,,Geeky fun for everyone,4.0,,"This place is great for kids, and also for grown up kids who are a littly geeky. The exhibitions are good fun, with optical illusions, tesla coils and other stuff. The also have a Imax theatre, were we watched a movie on the hubble telescop, which also was great.
The science center is good for families and thus who have an interest in science, the had some good informative exhibitions on cancer, viruses, water consumtion, global warming, etc, and some more ""playful"" were you interacted more. we spent the entire afternoon there and it was, considering this in Singapore, good value for our money. consider skipping if you´re to grown-up :)"
,,Fun and educative,4.0,,"Its not easy to engage pre-teens, but this one got mine all excited, and hooked. Apart from the exhibits, the show too was very good. A must-see for families with kids."
,,Good day out.,5.0,,"Did not expect to spend all day here but myself and my family did! We went to see an Imax film - Sea Rex, and then spent all day going from exhibits to science demonstrations which my children loved. There was a water type park where the children could go in. However, I took their swimming things only to find a sign posted next to the water park stating that children 6 years and under had to use swimming costumes and children above that age had to go into the water in their clothes!! A bit strange but as it was we never got to go in because we were still doing other things. A great day out."
,,Cheap and good.,5.0,,"science centre is probably the cheapest attraction yet the most informative visit I had in Singapore. its admission rate is <$10 per head and the food are not costly as well. I enjoyed their temporary exhibitions(body worlds and csi) and demonstrations especially the one on electricity which is really an eye opener. furthermore, the service is really good, giving very wise recommendations and offering of help such as a car buggy ( which stop my kid from crying ) my kid also enjoyed the waterplayground at the end of the day. I think its a must visit for everyone as it will be a satisfying and interesting experience."
,,"An excellent science centre, with a fun watermark attached",5.0,,"Singapore science centre is a very well put together science centre, with lots of different exhibits designed to show you various scientific things. The best section was the section on vision and light, with lots of different optical illusions and optical tricks.

There is also a waterworks section. Only loosely scientific,but a great way to finish up a museum trip for any child. Make sure you take something dry to change into after everyone has been soaked!"
,,More for kids than adults,2.0,,Visited scince centre and was fairly disapointed in most of the displays. I think it ia mainly aimed at amusing kids not adults.
,,easy to spend a whole day here with the kids,5.0,,"I took me ten years old daughter here at easter, it one one of the cheapest things I have done in singapore, she loved it, we spent a whole day here, there are still loads of things that we didnt get to do, there is the snowzone and conema that we didnt get a chance to see, she really wanted to play in the water park in the gardens, but the weather was quite bad.... excellent day out for kids, food court wasnt too expensive either.. would recommend taking the kids for an excellent day out .."
,,Not Number Three on My List,2.0,,"The Science Center website says this is the third most visited place in Singapore. But it didn't do much for me. I enjoy science, but found the exhibits either rather lame, broken or too complicated to follow. Most of the exhibits seemed geared towards small children. If you have been to a science center anywhere else you won't find much new here. See this after you've done everything else."
,,This is perfect treat for kids from...,5.0,,This is perfect treat for kids from 4-8years. And the Pixar animation show is also awesome.
,,Nice children holiday,5.0,,The best way to educate children: many attractions as a funny way to explain children how things work. Singapore is a very clean and organized city for a family tour.
,,"Affordable, educational day out for everyone.",4.0,,"Plenty of things to see and do here, plenty of interactive tasks for all ages and interesting facts for the adults. I came an expert on the history of DNA. The water garden and kinetic garden are fabulous fun for the kids, be sure to take a towel. The indoor snow slope nearby is also good fun. Easy to get to on the underground with a short walk through a market and shopping complex from the station. Plenty of places to buy food if staying for the day and you can also take your own. The airconditioning is nice and cool which is always a bonus for us in Singapore."
,,Wonderful learning experience for kids,5.0,,"We went to the Science Centre to visit the Body Worlds show back in December last year and discovered a whole lot of other activities in other exhibition halls around the centre. The galleries are thematic (e.g. anatomy, astrology, physics, mathematics, aquatic, etc.) and the stations/exhibitions are interactive. It is a must-visit, especially for young children. There is also a water park for children outside the Science Centre so go prepared with a change of clothes and/or swimwear.

Another tip: The gift store is very well-stocked with educational toys (mostly science and experiment kits) and books for kids so you might want to bring a little more cash with you for that, although they do accept credit cards as well. I spent about SGD$200 there getting some toys and gifts for Christmas.

A 30-minute metro train ride (or MRT ride) from the city will take you through the interesting suburbs/ neighbourhoods, to Jurong East station, which is roughly a 5-minute walk away from the Science Centre. (Ask for directions or look for a locality map when you get off.)

There is a McDonald's and a café on the premises itself but cheap, good local fare can be had at a food court across the street, on the way to/from the metro."

,,Tresure of Knowledge,5.0,,"Singapore Science Centre : dated: 3/12/09 Rating : Excellent

I went with my daugther to Singapore Science Centre and the experience was priceless. It is so beafutiful, full of information and knowledge plus very vibrant and colorful for the kids. There are several games thru' which the science concepts are explained. I have never seen something like this before. It is so big that you can't finish it in 1 day. It gives you an opportunity to do hands on practicals too. I think all students who are studying science, it is a must visit for them."
,,Must visit place in Singapore.,5.0,,This is one of the must visit places in Singapore if you have kids. Well worth a visit. My kids loved it. Take some change of clothes. There is a outdoor water park to play with fountains.
,,A centerpoint of my trip,5.0,,"This place is hugely underrated and deserves a higher place in the SIN attractions list, for sure. Lots of educational stands and displays, lots of interactive models, scientific shows and educational arts.

Unfortunately some parents confuse this place with kindergarten or even nursery and bring there toddlers and small kids. The very unpleasant sight to watch tantrums and hysterical cries of younger generation in this worthy and cultural environment. This place is for teenagers (and their parents) whose mind and level of understanding is fit for grasping the idea of using hydrogen in Tesla experiments, for example.

Very entertaining is a section *home of future* located on the second level of major exposition.

At the tickets booth you are allowed to purchase a package like *science centre+snow city* etc. Do not do it. Snow city is a wasting money option, stick to the centre only and enjoy it at full.

As for getting there, better take a taxi, MRT is rather far, and walk is unpleasant especially during rainy season."
,,"Vastly underrated Singapore stopoff for families. If you have children, this must be top of your list.",5.0,,"What a fantastic place for kids. Every exhibit is handson. The science factor isn't overwhelming, this is a place where kids' wonder can be explored. The entry hall's optical illusions had our 10, 8 and 5 yr old running from amazing optical experience to the next. The central atrium with its electrical demonstrations was outstanding, the maths area with its puzzles education, with the crowning piece being the outside water park which was great fun, including its huge fans to dry off (there is an area to change, but we didn't find it! Our kids got fairly wet, but dried quickly and wasn't a problem for the rest of the day). We arrived early (took the MRT to Jurong, then the bus, but we could have walked), and bought the combined entry and Omni-theatre entry pass. we left at around 3pm, but could have stayed longer. The Omni-theatre doubles as an Imax theatre and a planetarium. Some of the signs said that on some nights there were free planetarium shows. Outside there is a kinetic garden with more areas to explore. McDonalds is on-site, as is a cafe which makes awesome Oreo shakes.

Some people may say that this place is for geeks, but I think our kids enjoyed this place just as much as they enjoyed the zoo. It has the advantage of being inside as well, so you can avoid the rain, and the heat as well"
,,"Science, play and kids of all ages",5.0,,"Singapore Science Centre is one of those places whose remit is education and information and have to put it into an entertaining form. Well, so far as Im concerned they succeed, hugely.

The Science Center is easy to reach, any taxi can get you there, and travel by the MRT leaves you a 200m or so walk away. Entry is cheap to the core Centre, although this will not get you into the OMNImax Center and its films which do raise the cost considerably.

The Center caters to anyone with an interest in science and technology, kids and people with kids. Explanatory notes on exhibits start simple and can move from there to descriptions that can be exceptionally detailed.

As you approach you are greeted with the Kinetic Garden, a series of exhibits out the front of the center. After paying your entry fee you wander into the main Atrium by way of a bewildering array of optical illusions. The Atrium acts as an easy entry to all the exhibits.

The Center covers areas of science and technology ranging from robotics, industrial science and flight, through ecology and biomedical science to areas designed for kids. As well as the internal exhibits the Center maintains an Ecogarden at the rear. Many exhibits are hands on, and there are live displays - the Tesla coil display in the Atrium is spectacular as is the electricity themed show. Certain areas cycle as sponsored exhibitions come and go.

There are food and drink outlets in the centre, as well as a shop and a walkway connecting the Center to the OMNImax theatres.

The Science Center is one of my must visit locations when I go to Singapore for any length of time. If its your thing then the Center has to be something to consider spending time at if you have only limited time in the city as it gives a perspective on modern Singapore."
