,,An oasis of peace in a busy city.,5.0,,"This park is conveniently located and is well served by public transport. If you have trouble walking, it may be better to catch a taxi to the Fort Canning Hotel and wend your way down on the many paths that take you to the various attractions.
The park is on an historic hill which was the site of the 14th century kings, Raffles house and the army command centre where the decision to surrender Singapore was made in WW2.
So much history.
There are nine gardens including Raffles Garden and the Spice Garden. Sang Nila Utama Garden is a must see with its flowers, ponds and statuettes.
Winding paths and steep steps help you navigate through this magnificent park. Expansive lawns, brilliant flowers and impressive trees - something for everyone."
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"The world media has covered Singapore's efforts to go green very well. There are vertical gardens along building surfaces, old trees line up major arteries, etc. However, there are also beautiful parks in the midst of the city. Fort Canning is one of them, with historic value to boot. It's a must see in Singapore, with its beautiful gardens, well-tended lanes and elegant trees."
,,Bicentenial singapore,5.0,,"Excellent exhibition n acts to share how singapore arrives till now. Book tickets now, ending in september. Great!!"
,,Singapore Bicentennial Celebration,5.0,,"It was a steamy afternoon in the park as I walked around looking at the hotel, the original entrance gate to the old fort and the outdoor Keramat for the last ruler of Singapore.

Thus I was quite happy to have stumbled across Singapore‚Äôs Bicentennial Celebration being held in the main building in Fort Canning and get some needed AC. As luck would have it tickets had to be reserved in advance but I put my name on the waiting list anyway. They said it could be awhile but I was called within five minutes! For free admission, well worth it!

The celebration show was a great production combining both live acting with innovative stages and great sound and video. The show progressed from Singapore‚Äôs original settlement, its first ruler, WWII and then all the way to the present. It was a celebration not only of the country but its diverse population.

After the show I wandered through some of the open air exhibits in very unique structures. Books, maps and other items were showcased.

The other parts of the park to enjoy was behind the Centre with its large open lawn great for picnics or just hanging out, beautiful gardens, the overlook with canons and and the out of place headstone and monument remains of an old Jesuit cemetery."
,,Short cut but most informative,5.0,,Took a shortcut from Clarke Quay to Dohby Gourt Station. Thought it would be gust a walk in the park but turned out to be an excursion all of it own. Follow the signs from the bridge at Clarke Quey walk past the Mica Building which was apparently the first Singapore police station and later used as an interrogation centre by the Japanese in WW11. Clime the steps up to Raffles House and the lighthouse. The walk takes you past the old Fort with its WW11 Bunkers. If you are feeling flush you can have high tea at Hotel Fort Canning before dropping down to Orchard Road.
,,Jogging in the middle of Singapore City,4.0,,"Just near Orchard Road and City Hall MRT Station, Fort Canning offers a relief to those wanting some view of nature in their morning run. Quite a historic site. A round could take about less than 2km"
,,Country‚Äôs one of historical landmarks,4.0,,"The park, a 18-hectare space is chock full of attractions‚Äîfrom ancient artefacts for history buffs to outdoor lawns for concerts, and of course, greenery for nature lovers. The charming boutique Hotel Fort Canning, also lies here.
It‚Äôs a great place to unwind and become in sync with nature. Moreover there are also a number of trails the park offers."
,,Historic walks,5.0,,A must walk in Singapore as we celebrate The Bicentennial of Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore üåªüôèüíê
,,An adventure discovery afternoon,4.0,,Walk around the Fort Canning Park and you will discover many interesting historical stuff that will definitely broaden our knowledge and increase our knowledge on the history of Singapore in the early days.
,,Lovely park on a gentle slope,5.0,,"A clean, well sign posted public park with a lot of history. Remnants of cannons, a lighthouse, a flag mast and an empty house are shown from the early days when Singapore was a British colony. There are loads of named plants and trees along the paths. There are also a number of themed areas that are beautifully put together."
,,Lovey place to walk within the city,4.0,,A lovely place to walk and see beautiful plants and trees. Plenty of history about. The lighthouse area is interesting to see and imagine what Singapore was before all the development. The bunker is interesting if you like to know more about the war.
,,Nice Walk About,4.0,,"Also known as the ""Forbidden Hill"" this a very nice to walk about although one needs to be prepared for some climbs. The set up is nice, the trees and flowers are beautiful and one can also see some of the remains of this military strong hold."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Fort Canning was the first place we visited in Singapore when we arrived, it was great fun. There was ALOT of walking and climbing hills involved, there was lots of different places you could visit including a small arts exhibition and the fort canning museum which is currently open until some time in September. Check it out if you have a spare couple of hours!!!"
,,Jubilee Park Playground,4.0,,"There's a great new playground at Fort Canning known as the Jubilee Park Playground, located right near the mrt exit. Very popular with younger children in the mornings and easily combined with a visit to Fort Canning proper. My kids come here a few times a week and seem to really enjoy it."
,,Great place,5.0,,"Great place to visit to beat the heat. Heaps to see from raffles house location,flag staff ,the old fort,raffles spice garden. Great walking trails lots of old trees and heaps of history. Wear comfy shoes. The old grave markers are worth a look."
,,The Bicentennial Experience - direction,5.0,,"This is fairly easy. Take a train directly to Fort Canning station. Once there, exit B - take either side turn - is really right behind the station. U will c a children playground with long slide. There is an escalator, yes n more escalators. Is actually outdoor n escalators right in the park, amazing. There is even lift at certain section. Really friendly for the elderly and those who needs help. This experience is FOC, however u will need to do an online booking in order to attend. I love the aircon, wonderful. We enjoy the Bicentennial experience, especially the rain effect, my kids love it."
,,A walk in the park,4.0,,"Great place to go for a walk or run through for abit of fitness and getting to do abit of sight seeing of some old WW2 history along the way..park also has some calastetics equipment for gym use like chin up bars,dip bars and sit up bars.
Also a park for the kids to play on for abit of family time"
,,Escalator rides to the top from Fort Canning mrt,5.0,,"Fort Canning park is situated on a little hill in the middle of the town area. With the new renovation recently completed, one can visit this park without walking much steps. An ideal way to begin the visit is from Fort Canning mrt. There is an innovative playground after the exit from the mrt followed by escalators bringing one to the top without climbing the steps. At the top, there are many shaded paths to take to explore the park. The various views at the top are good too. Attractions include the spice garden and an exhibit showing the archaeological dig and its discoveries. There are many exit points leading to different parts of town. This park is also great for a jog, brisk walk or to connect with nature. Strongly recommended."
,,Such a gorgeous park accessible anytime of the day!,5.0,,"I am completely in love with this place. I particularly stayed in a hotel across because of great reviews about the park. I had to see and experience it for myself and all good words were dead on! The entire park, so well maintained and well lit regardless of the time. You'd also feel safe even running early in the morning. I had the entire place to myself running past 4 am... Even better, head on out to the footbridge and it connects you to Clarke Quay area. Head on out farther (following the underpasses) should lead you to where the Merlion is (obviously another awesome place to run!). There's no other place I'd stay in the next time I visit Singapore soon."
,,Don‚Äôt miss out visiting this place again and again!!!,5.0,,"Our favourite outdoor concert, outdoor movie, park for a walk, picnic and so on....so many things that you can enjoy visiting this place. Really one of our faves in Singapore. Better check their site to make sure that you‚Äôre up to date for upcoming events"
,,A little oasis.,4.0,,"Despite having visited Singapore more than ten times in as many years, we had never explored Fort Canning Park. Like so much else on this island state, it is a marvel of meticulous planning, that they have yet again been able to cram so much into such a small space. A really inspiring blend of gardens, cultural attractions and glimpses into the history of this amazing country.
Be prepared for plenty of steps!"
,,Beautiful Park,4.0,,"This is a beautiful park on a hill overlooking the city and harbor. There is a very well marked trail with signage that tells the history of Singapore, from mythology to modern times.

Visit The Battle Box, but make sure you leave time for the park and other points of interest that include The Flagstaff, The Lighthouse, and the buildings that made up the old fort.

The archeological site is still a work in progress."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Fort Canning Park is excellent. Well signposted, with information about the history of the area and well maintained, this is a great place to spend an hour or more. The trees and greenery are a welcome place of serenity in this busy city. And there are some great views too. The only thing I‚Äôd note is there are some steep stairs and gradients, as you‚Äôd expect for something on a hill - all manageable and with good paths. Highly recommended."
,,Historical site of Singapore,4.0,,"This is a historical site of Singapore. It has Inland lighthous, The Fort, the battlebox. There is also a spice garden near the park. The hilltop offers beautiful views of the city and is a peaceful to just to take a stroll."
,,Historical Site,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park, an iconic hilltop landmark has witnessed many of Singapore‚Äôs historical milestones. The Hill once had Palaces of 14th century Kings and served as Headquarters of the Far East Command Centre and British Army Barracks. The decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942 was also made on thi Hill, at the Underground Command Centre, commonly known as Battle Box. One can visit the Box and also take a 1.5 hrs guided Tour to relive history.

Now Fort Canning Park is a venue for various celebrations like Concerts, Theatrical performances. Its ancient artefacts are a must-see, and its lush greenery and expansive lawns offer a variety of arts, heritage and nature experiences. Whether one is attracted by the Park‚Äôs ancient artefacts and rich heritage or simply its tranquility, this Hilltop Park offers something for the whole family.

To bring to life the rich history of the Hill, developments to Fort Canning Park and its surroundings are being carried out.

The Battlebox was a British Army Command Centre located 9 metres underground, in the 1930s. It was part of the headquarters of the army that defended Singapore during World War II. It was also the site where Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival made the fateful decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942.

The Park is must see place while visiting Singapore. Easy to reach by MRT from any part of the City. Get down at Dhoby Ghaut & look for Exit- B to come up to road level. Walk across to the Bus bay for Padestrian Crossing. Then take your left & walk straight. It leads to the Park.

Appended are few photographs shot at venue."
,,Nice park with historical buildings and fort remains,4.0,,"This park is worth a visit, but for the park it self the views, and as well the remains of the fort, but the old one and the battle box."
,,Want to see an inland lighthouse? Here's your chance!,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park, a hilltop landmark, once sited the palaces of 14th century Kings and served as the Headquarters of the Far East Command Centre and British Army Barracks. The decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942 was also made on the hill, in the Underground Far East Command Centre, commonly known as Battle Box.

The opportunity to get out of the blazing sun and walk beneath the cooling shade of beautiful old trees is too good to resist, and Fort Canning Park is a great way to do it. With a wealth of history to explore, and views down over Singapore, it's a good place to while away some time.

the Park is easy to get to, with a choice of three MRT stations: Fort Canning (Downtown line, Exit B), Clarke Quay (North East line, Exit E) or Dhoby Ghaut (North South and North East lines, Exit B)."
,,Great Tour of WW2 Underground Bunkers,4.0,,We absolutely recommend a tour in Fort Canning hill in the heart of the city covering the historic battles of Singapore on a tour of a former World War II underground command centre of 26 rooms. Fascinating stuff!
,,Beautiful Park in the Middle of Singapore,4.0,,"We had a nice walk through this park on a Sunday morning. Very quiet and would be a great place for a nice run. Lots of trees, grass and a couple of nice spots for picture taking."
,,A nice walk with photo spots,5.0,,‰æÜÈÄôË£èÂ∞±ÊòØÁÇ∫‰∫ÜÊãçÈÄôÂºµÁÖßÁâá Âú∞ÈªûÂæàÂ•ΩËµ∞Âú®YMCAÈôÑËøë Êñ∞Âä†Âù°ÂæàÂ∞ë‰∏çÂêåÂú∞ÈªûÈÉΩÂèØ‰ª•Ëµ∞Ë∑Ø‰æÜÂà∞ÈÅî ÈÄôÂºµÁÖßÁâáÊòØÁî®Ëá™Êãç‰πæÊîæÂú®Âú∞‰∏ä Áî®iPhoneÊãçÂá∫‰æÜÁöÑ ËßíÂ∫¶Ë¶ÅÊØîËºÉÂπ≥Â∞ëË®± ÈÄôÊ®£Â∞±ÂèØ‰ª•ÁúãÂà∞Ê¥ûÂè£Â§ö‰∏ÄÈªû More photos @ ig wtifwtif
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,We did a tour of the underground bunkers where the British surrendered to the Japanese in WW2. Definitely worth a visit it was a very informative tour.
,,Good to spend family time,4.0,,"Its got history, its got garden, its got large acreage to walk about, its nice to be within nature with your family or just alone. The building is well maintained and the lawn is nice place to host a small picnic."
,,Great park for walking or jogging.,4.0,,"Went through this park late in the morning. If you like to exercise this park has a lot of people using it for that purpose. I loved the large trees and their broad canopies provided wonderful shade from the tropical sun. There was an interesting spice garden area, archeological dig, and a small cafe for snacks and drinks."
,,Lots of steps,4.0,,"There are a lot of steps and hilly parts to enter the park which ever direction you come from, probably why the park was so quiet.

We went to the park to visit Battlebox, WW11 government bunker. only accessible by a tour.

Not much else to visit the park for. The views in places are good if the city."
,,ILight festival,4.0,,"We once again visited the Fort canning park, this time for the Ilight festival, held in Feb. It was great. My daughter played happily on the piano kept for visitors. Was a lovely evening"
,,Hidden gem,5.0,,"This park was a 5 minute walk from the YMCA One Orchard. A lovely place to walk around and just be in nature, but also with history behind it from WW2 for those with an interest. The park is free along with lots of historical facts. There was a paid entry story about the war but we did not go there. Quite hilly for those who cannot manage stairs/hills easily."
,,Very good,4.0,,"Freeto walk around but not well signposted and a lot of works going on meant some footpaths were closed.
Very nice and not too crowded.
Certain things to do are to be paid for and as I was short if time I didn't do these.
But the open areas and footpaths are great to walk round"
,,Lots of work; poor signposting,3.0,,"Given its significance in Singapore's history, I was keen to see Fort Canning. On the day I went, I was somewhat disappointed. There is a lot of heavy construction work going on on the Fort Canning MRT station side, with paths suddenly closed with no prior warning (very annoying on a steep hill in the heat!) At the top is now a reservoir that you cannot visit. Getting down the other side was as much of a challenge as getting in. Sort your signs out, FCP!!!"
,,The BattleBox Tour is a must,5.0,,"I was in Singapore in 1960, age 6, and this place was where my dad worked. It is a really peaceful park with great trees, lawns, historical military walks and the awesome presenter at the BATTLEBOX is a must."
,,Historic,4.0,,Its a steep hill so beware of the climb Best to come early to beat the heat and crowds .Very historic and beautiful gardens.
,,"Wonderful, interesting nature filled walk.",4.0,,"This is a super park, packed full of interesting trees and plants (many labelled) - you can hardly believe you are in the middle of a city. There is a circular walk around the top with plenty of interesting things to see, some great views, great bird watching, public toilets and lots of places to sit. Lots of people seem to mention how steep it is. Yes - you have to get up to the hill, but after that it's a largely flat, leisurely walk round the top. And although steep, it's a short walk, don't let it put you off. Next to the fantastic National Museum so combine the two."
,,Great park,4.0,,"We had a great early morning stroll in Fort Canning Park. It‚Äôs super steep, and we were quickly very hot and sticky. We only went because it was right next to our hotel - and I am not sure I would have travelled across the city to it. But the park is nice, and well shaded and seemed to be popular with expat joggers. There was quite a lot of building work going on when we visited which put us off slightly."
,,Rich on history,4.0,,"Walk for 2 hours in this beautiful park with a lot of history which was called before ‚ÄòGovernment hill‚Äô. ‚ÄòOriginal‚Äô pictures are displayed with information to have an idea how fort Canning was in the early days of Singapore.
Quite some renovations ongoing in the park"
,,Must go,4.0,,"You can get more photo from here haha. But many tourist come. At Check point, you should come early ( I think) because in the afternoon maybe more people here."
,,"Beautiful, Historic Park in the middle of Singapore",4.0,,"Fort Canning Park occupies a very significant and strategic location, adjacent to the Singapore River and close to the downtown business district as well as Orchard Road.

Once the home of the ruling Malay kings, more recently, during the Second World Way, it was the british army headquarters when they made the infamous decision to surrender to the Japanese.

There are steep walks here [being a hill] but if you like gardens, it is well worth it. This was also the first site of the Singapore Botanic gardens."
,,"Nice environment, with construction sites.",4.0,,"We visited last Sat morning with kids, it was a pleasant and easy walk. Kind of hot as there is no covered way. Kids enjoyed the small swing and the 2 cannons, took many photos. Giving the prime location of the park, it is really a must visit for both locals and tourists. Remember the old days when Mr Lee still preferred a walk there, bumped into him once."
,,Nice park and gardens although the museum was closed on our trip.,4.0,,Finally got to visit Fort Canning Park this trip and can cross it off the bucket list. Worth a visit if you like parks and gardens but it is very steep and lots of stairs and uphill climbing and in the humidity it's not easy. Don't know if there is an easier way in we did it the hard way and was not disappointed.
,,Historically significant and well worth a visit.,5.0,,Fort Canning is where the Englishman Sir Stamford Raffles built his residence which was also used by other residents and governors. It became known as Government Hill until it was renamed Fort Canning in 1861 when a fort was built on the site.
,,Greennnnyyy,5.0,,"Love this hidden gem.Its very good spot for take a pic. Prepare your ootd and its free,just go here in the morning or afternoon"
,,Very nice walking trails,4.0,,Lots of construction. The park could use better access instruction from SMRT. I enjoyed a few hours wandering there and reading the historic contexts and seeing the older buildings
,,Battle Box,5.0,,"Joanna did a fantastic tour today, very informative and was fantastic to listen to. Well worth the visit Thankyou"
,,Nice walk but a bit of a building site,3.0,,Lovely shady walk on a hot day and very relaxing with certain spots affording lovely views. The afternoon I chose to visit was very quite which was lovely but it was a shame about all the building and repair work going on. It is still worth a visit and the grounds are very lush and lovely. Lots of stairs to climb but they are well maintained.
,,A park in the middle of the city,4.0,,Hot and humid Singapore! So come here in the late evening and try to catch the sunset at Raffles Terrace. Interesting view of the Singapore River as well as Marina Bay Sands! Lots of wild birds and animals too. Was hoping to see a Hornbill but saw Jungle Fowls instead. Interesting flora.
,,Good place for walking on a hot day,3.0,,"The park is cool and green but is really not suitable for people with disabilities as there are lots of stairs to climb to get from one part to another. Could not do the Battlebox as all tours were fully booked, and you can't get in without a tour which was disappointing. The herb garden was nice as was the shrine to the last Sultan, Iskander Shah, which was right next to the herb garden. The garden has good descriptions of the various tropical herbs for anyone who is interested in spices. Plenty of birds and butterflies but no other wildlife to be seen. It is worth doing if you are interested in the history of Singapore and want a bit more than the national museum can offer."
,,Hill-top quiet green space in Singapore,5.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a large public green space in the heart of Singapore yet on the afternoon of our visit we saw very few visitors virtually having the park to yourselves where ever we walked. The park is loaded with things to see, the main reason we were there was to visit the Battlebox, the underground WW2 military bunker. The park is located on the hill behind the National Museum of Singapore, there was a short climb up a series of staircases to reach the Battlebox visitors centre and the park. Later after our Battlebox tour we wandered around Fort Canning Park enjoying the many outdoor art sculptures, gardens, extensive varieties of plants, memorial walls, old buildings and other structures before exiting near the old Pollice Station at Clarke Quay."
,,Historic Park,4.0,,"Nice park with some decent views of the city. Take the circuitous walk around the resevior to see the old lighthouse, flag pole, gardens, and remnants of the fort. We didn't do the Battlebox Tour as it was 20 dollars a person and little kids aren't permitted. Maybe some other time. The park itself is free."
,,I got a sense of some of Singapore's past,4.0,,"An interesting park with plenty of shade and informative signs. There was a lot of renovation going on when we were there, but still lots to see. It was interesting to see the old gravestones and see how many people died at a very young age in the 1800s. We'll visit another time to do the tour of the Bunker, but it looked good."
,,Visit with friends,3.0,,"We made some good memories that's true but it is not very stroller friendly. We had a nice picnic and took nice pictures but since our toddlers could not climb so many stairs up the fort, we left early and went to some other place."
,,Jewel in the City's Crown,5.0,,"Singapore has many charming and idilic locations but Fort Canning Park remains my favourite place in the City State. We walked thought it many times in the 1980‚Äôs when it was pretty much derelict, evocative and slightly eerie but today it provides a beautiful, elevated, shady oasis of tranquility overlooking and overlooked by the frenetic City. Fort Canning Park is steeped in history from the ancient and pre-colonial eras to the fall of Empires, it is or has been the abode of Kings, a botanic garden, a cemetery, a fortress, place of government, a park and to visit it is an education. We have always stayed on Orchard Road and walk through Fort Canning Park when we visit China Town, the CBD, the Bay Area, the Colonial District, sometimes we go there just to enjoy the Park it‚Äôs self. The Park is quite small but so full of interest that it can fill at least half, possible a whole day. Some of the things to do; visit the cemetery with it‚Äôs Gothic Gates, cupolas and memorials, review the memorial stones and appreciate how very short were the lives of the early settlers and traders. View the colonial buildings that grace the park, one is now the Fort Canning Hotel the other the Fort Canning Centre, both are architecturally significant. Walk the Spice Garden, FCP was part of the original botanic garden and many experimental plants were grown here, a small botanic trail remains and the plaques are most informative. See the archeological excavations in progress, they are open to public view, well described and have many interesting artefacts to illustrate the history of this once forbidden hill. Visit the Old Lighthouse and learn about its technical evolution and the courage of those who risked their lives to care for it during the Japanese occupation. Take a look at the Time Ball that marked 13:00 each day and the historic Flag Staff, both are close to the site of Raffle‚Äôs bungalow and well described by boards at their locations. Visit the (alleged but unlikely) tomb of Iskander Shah and read the myth of his violent accession to the throne of ancient Singapore (Tamasek). Walk the terraces named after the influential men who made and managed Singapore, Raffles, Farquhar, Bond, Lewin, Dobbie and others. Visit the military installations and buildings, the great gates of the fort itself (try pushing them closed!), escape through the Sally Port, pose for photos on the old cannons and if you get the opportunity book on a guided tour of the hill itself and of the Battle Box, both are thoroughly worth while if you have any interest in history and the lives of those who made Singapore‚Äôs history. Apart from the history, the flora and fauna are surprisingly rich and varied for a small City centre park, Red Junglefowl scratch around, sunbirds can be heard and occasionally glimpsed and apparently the park is popular with local ornithologists. Walk the Tree Route, many of the trees are quite magnificent and there are numerous photo opportunities which, with a little framing will give the appearance of being taken in deep jungle not a city centre. If you are keen to work out, join those who run up and down the steps at Canning Rise, jog the paths that weave through park or visit the fitness station near Badang Terrace. If you want a break from exploring the park, the National Museum of Singapore is accessible directly from the hill and apart from the exhibitions there is also a very nice restaurant that serves tea from the Clipper Tea Company and delicious cakes. The Park is delightful after dark, I sometimes take a stroll there to enjoy the tranquility and let my imagination wonder to those ancient Malay Kings whose graves lie still undiscovered in this very special place."
,,A compact historical landmark,4.0,,"Fort Canning is a breath of fresh air in the middle of the bustle and dazzle of Singapore. It is set up on a foothill just enough for tourist and local to go hiking and jogging in a beautifully landscaped trail . Every turn is marked with historical notes on a signpost which cleverly enough overlooks the beautiful Clarke Quay . We enjoyed nature, history , culture rolled into one . A must try in Singapore . No entrance fees ."
,,Great for History Buffs,5.0,,My husband is quite the avid War Buff and he & our daughter found this place fascinating! They operate Tours pretty much daily - The Battlebox Tour (hour and 15mins) was well worth the visit.
,,Well kept,5.0,,Very well kept gardens and grounds. A nice peaceful spot in the heart of the city. Good to have a wander through.
,,"Nice park, historic center of Singapore",4.0,,"Nice park on a small hill. Close to Orchard Road. Nice destination if you want some green spaces. Lots of history here, including old British military HQ buried inside the hill. Takes about 45 min to walk around and see the main sights."
,,An oasis in the middle of the the city,5.0,,"I loved visiting this park, and grabbed any opportunity I could get to go through this park by cutting through it to go to the other side! Its close to Clark Quay on one side and Orchard Road near Dhoby Ghaut on another side.

The first time I spent a couple of hours reading all the well-laid out signages (Singapore loves signages!) and the next few times I would just wander around it, or read a book. Its a quiet and peaceful place right in the middle of the city, and a haven for nature lovers. Just be sure to carry your umbrella and some insect repellent."
,,"The ""must"" photo shooting spot",4.0,,"Stunning spot for photo shooting. There are many ppl skip the park and just go photo shooting at this spot. Dhauby Ghaut MRT, exit B, then cross the street the the left following the walk way you will see this spot."
,,"Historic, Serene and Peaceful",5.0,,"This is a must see whilst in Singapore. To view the tunnels is by tour guide only and when inside, you can fully appreciate why. The grounds are pristine."
,,Fort Canning A Gem of History & Nature,5.0,,The walking tour to fort canning was a pleasant one and very informative with the history of the beginning of Singapore. My guide Pavla was showing us a walk through time the resting place of the last king of Singapore. üëç
,,Wonderful park,5.0,,"Singapore has a number of fine parks and this is definitely one of them. Even though you are in the middle of a very busy city, you can get away from the traffic and crowds of people and get some peace and quiet in beautiful surroundings. Well worth a visit."
,,Beautiful Garden with a view of the city,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a little bit of a haven in Singapore - as it is away from the hustle and bustle of the city. In the colonial days of British rule, it served as the army barracks and its headquarters.

It is worth climbing the stairs to the top of the hill to get a good view of the city.

The area has the Fort Canning Arts Centre - an impressive looking building; the Register of Marriages; and the artillery. The area hosts various concerts.

The garden has a spice garden."
,,Really worth a stroll around this old fort,5.0,,"If you like walking, and aren't too worried about slopes and steps, then a walk around this historic park you'll enjoy. There is plenty of history around the park, as well as the WW2 Battlebox."
,,Oasis in city,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a very pleasant park in the middle of Singapore. A hill itself is a park, and you can take a walk without being disturbed by car. It is not hard to climb, and I am sure it is worth."
,,Park with a History - Fort Canning Park Singapore,4.0,,"Quite unlike the nature reserve protected for its flora and fauna or an area of important geological or special interests with its unique ecosystems, parks are ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù with humans in mind for various purposes largely recreational ‚Äì jogging, walking and cycling, or social gatherings like a picnics or a perhaps a date.

But Fort Canning Park (Singapore) offers more than leisure and recreation. It is a park rich in history. Sitting at the hilltop, it has witnessed many of the country‚Äôs historical milestones. Apparently, it used to site palaces before the founding of modern Singapore. It was made Headquarters of the Far East Command Centre and British Army Barracks during the colonial days. The decision to surrender to the Japanese in 1942 was also made on the hill.

I have been to Fort Canning Park on several occasions but for events ‚Äì outdoor concerts, movie screening under the stars, hotel dining, etc. This visit I recently made was a different one where I took time walking through and around the park.

There are a number of walking trails rich in history presented by replicas of a past era such as flagstaff, lighthouse and 9-pound cannon, ruins of the fort left along with preserved underground tunnels.

This park is right in the centre of the city but yet away from the hustle and bustle of city life. It is somewhat strange to see in the backdrop around the park with skyscrapers on one side, the riverside / quays on another, and yet a serene view of a church just down the hill. And for the romantic, the park is also a favourite photo-shoot venue for weddings as it is neighbour to the ROM (Registry of Marriages).

It is also a home to the arts, playing hosts to concerts, theatre productions and festivals. The lush greenery and expansive lawns offer a variety of arts, heritage and nature experiences. The Fort Canning Arts Centre was undergoing some upgrading when I visited and as I understand, it is part of the enhancements to Fort Canning Park and its surroundings which will be progressively completed from June 2019.

If you are a history puff and enjoy a leisurely walk in a park under the cool umbrellas of trees (my favourite has to be the Banyan Trees), come visit the park. Or if you want an early morning jog around the greenery on a hilltop, this is a good place to sweat it out. Should you plan to visit during organised events, make time before / after the activity to see what this park has to offer.

From some National Parks Singapore materials, development plans are underway ""where the heritage landscapes of Fort Canning Hill and its surroundings will be restored and weaved seamlessly into Fort Canning Park with the creation of three gardens, namely the Royal Garden, the First Botanic Garden, and Jubilee Park"".

Make a date and visit the Park in the latter half of 2019."
,,Better park than historic site,3.0,,"Fort Canning had strategic and historic importance to Singapore. Oh the hilltop overlooking the river, it served as the gateway for decades. Named for the first Viceroy after the British Crown took possession of the lands managed by the East India Tea Company following the loss in the American Revolution.
The grounds are beautiful and the views very cool, but other than the old gate, the gates that served as entry to the old cemetery, and the bunker (which can be toured), there is not much ""fort"" to it anymore. Two canon are perched at high points, but those are not original and reset in the 1950s.
Great history - better as a park. As a history buff I enjoyed it, but do not expect to see an old battlement."
,,Good walk to see the city,4.0,,Take the stairs to to the dirt to get a good view of the city. It can be hot but on the day we want it had just rained so it‚Äôs quite nice taking around. The trees are massive and provide good coverage. Very interesting trees and branches and tree stubs. It‚Äôs close to the fort canning hotel and there‚Äôs a museum as well. You can see two cannons on either side of the park. There‚Äôs a guided tour to the old battleground hide out but we didn‚Äôt go in.
,,Beautiful Garden Amidst The Beautiful City,4.0,,"It's a beautiful garden and a nice place to have a walk or jog. You'll feel amazing walking here.

You get free entry in the garden. If you're in Singapore, I think it's a place to visit.

The place is well connected by a metro station near to it."
,,A stunning garden in the heart of town,5.0,,"I was recommended this place from a Singaporean friend. This garden is a gorgeous place to stroll through, whilst taking in the historic surrounds. Located within walking distance from multiple MRT stations, the signage makes it very easy to navigate. I walked in from the north side, and made my way towards Circular Quay, however it is very easy to lose yourself for several hours in this peaceful environment. It is quite hilly, so I wouldn't recommended for those with mobility restrictions."
,,Greenery !!!,4.0,,"Walked along Coleman Street and up the Canning Rise , involves climbing several steps. Large area, full of greenery. Different types of plants all around. Didn't get time to visit the bunker."
,,Historical site,4.0,,"A historical site that provides a glimpse of Singapore leading up to WW2. It is the site where the British General Percival decided to surrender to Japanese forces. There is a paid guided tour of the underground bunkers. Check the tour time if interested before going. History aside, it is a peaceful green space to stroll and take a break from the city bustle."
,,Brings to life events surrounding defense and surrender of Singapore to the Japanese,5.0,,"Well worth the time. Go into the bunker and learn about a piece of history that many don‚Äôt appreciate or know much about. Learn how 50,000 Japanese with superior equipment and fighting experience overwhelmed a poorly equipped British Empire force of 120,000. See the confined spaces the allied forces lived in and where the decision was made to surrender. Through a mix of docent, historical recreations of some the rooms and movies they take you through the story and leave you with a very memorable experience. Don‚Äôt miss this."
,,Beautiful garden hidden in the midst of a great city,4.0,,"We spent a morning walking around the gardens of Fort Canning- lovely shady areas with pathways and seating areas. We were going to do the Battlebox Tour, but all the morning tours were full- would suggest booking if you want to do a tour at a specific time. You can easily spend hours walking around the grounds of the estate and forget the city on the outside of the walls."
,,An Oasis,5.0,,"What an incredible place. The fort and bunker are set on a famous hill, only 5 minute walk from the nearest MRT.

Well worth paying around $18 for the bunker tour that takes about 90 minutes. Very informative and the guide was very happy to answer any questions. He really bought to live what happened there during WW2.

The parks around the fort are some of the best in Singapore.

Allow 2 to 3 hours to really enjoy and respect this monument to all those is WW2."
,,Interesting piece of history,4.0,,"Recommend timing your visit to also take in the ""Battle Box"" and a tour through the tunnels to get the most out of this site."
,,Pretty average,4.0,,"Not the most interesting place, but nice to kill time here if you‚Äôre in singapore for a few extra days with nothing to do. Wear some comfortable shoes and bring water on a hot day, as there are many steps!"
,,Better on a cloudy day,4.0,,We picked the wrong entrance to get to Battlebox thinking Fort Canning MRT would be the obvious stop. We had to climb lots of steps and it was muggy. Some steps are also closed for works. We found are way round but imagine the upward climb would be hell on a hot day. An interesting park with an important place in history.
,,Beautiful established gardens heart of Singapore,4.0,,"We loved immersing ourselves in the luxury of walking, smelling and enjoying the beauty of Fort Canning Park. A must visit is the Old British Army headquarters now an upmarket Hotel. Go to historic Fort Canning British military barracks ( under renovation) and must do Battle Box tour.
A lovely space with quietness in the heart of Singapore.
Would be 5 star however garden renovations underway."
,,Crazy Rich Heritage.,3.0,,This is a park but it is also a treasure trove of Singapore past and history dates back to 1600s. If you like history and imagininv yourself back in the olden days. This is THE place. Downside...it is undergoing a revamp. Upside...there are still many trees around....not invaded by buildings yet.
,,Battle box was visited by my husband and me in fort canning park,5.0,,"It is place which tells you about the surrender of British army.We were amazed the way the guide explained to us ,her knowledge about the subject was great not a minute during our tour into battle box we felt bored. Well conducted and knowledgeable.Very well kept. Kudos to the people who are maintaining the place.A must visit for locals and tourists."
,,Architecture meets nature,5.0,,"If you are into architecture and Plants or if you are an aspiring photographer this is the place for you, just be ready for a LONG WALK,
wear your most comfortable sneakers..
but it will all be worth it, Trust the Photos that I have uploaded :)"
,,Fort Canning Park Singapore,4.0,,"This is a nice place to go for a walk or run.. Very shady will lots of trees... Also there is a spice gardens where you can see plants of pepper, coriander etc..."
,,Bird Watchers Dream,5.0,,"This park is such a relaxing & tranquil place. There is an assortment of birdlife including White-bellied Sea eagles. Whilst there my partner & I spotted 20 species of birds without even trying. The park grounds & gardens are well maintained & clean with beautiful shady trees, some steeped in history. The park has guided tours to the Fort Canning ""Battlebox"" where the British conceded surrender to the Japanese in 1942 and of various historical sites Fort Canning Hill. If you just want to kick back and relax in the park, in the cool & shade of the trees whilst in the centre of Singapore central, then this park is well worth the visit. For the exercise conscious, there are plenty of well maintained paths/stairs for a good run or walk."
,,A view of the past,5.0,,"If your interested in the story of Singapores surrender and the daily activities of running the war here this is a great place to start. The battle box is by tour only costing $18 for a adult and $9 for a child, tours run for about 1 hour 15 minutes and walk you through the bunkers used during the defence of singapore we had a great guide his knowledge was outstanding as we walked from room to room it is set up some what as it looked during operations at the time. It is under ground if you have any fears the rooms are big well lit and air conditioned.
Tour times vary with Monday afternoons only, the rest of the week including weekends from 9.45am"
,,Something other than the bus,5.0,,"We were intent on getting back to Bencoolen Street so, rather than take a taxi, bus or the MRT, we decided to walk over the hill. It's a little steep but the route is lined with fabulous heritage trees. There are some signs telling people to beward of lightning strike and some far too unfriendly ones indicating anyone who climbs the fence and gets into the reservoir area will be shot. At the top is the Battlebox, the site of a British cock-up that handed 120,000 men to the Japanese in WWII. Tours only at set times. Wander down the other side to the National History Museum and Orchard Road."
,,Greenery abounds,5.0,,"I barely scratched the surface when visiting this park but I still highly recommend a visit. Would be great for a run. I had a nice nice stroll despite the heat. Enjoyed all the trees, plants, herbs, and flowers, plus the slopes, architecture (Raffles House) and beautiful pathways. If you are looking to escape the city with all its concrete and glass structures, this place is worth a visit."
,,Relaxing despite hot weather.,5.0,,A great park with great view. There are cannons and along the way are history about singapore‚Äôs origins. Lots of trees including a Petai tree which bears the petai vegetable.
,,Bunker tour worth it!,4.0,,"My hubby & I did the 2.5hr walking bunker tour. To be honest, I did it for hubby, but really enjoyed the whole experience.

Our tour guide Weina (""pronounced like the American sausage"" as she told us ), was fabulous. Clear English, very informative & had a great sense of humour.

The bunker was awesome, but you're not allowed to take photos inside (fair enough), learnt so much. We had planned to do another tour elsewhere, but didn't need to. However, we did visit the Old Ford Factory where Singapore was surrendered to the Japanese (this was a heavy experience).

Although you're given a bottle of ice cold water for the walk, I reccomend taking an extra & make sure you'rewearing really comfy shoes (you'll need it!)"
,,Unhappy though Lovely room and ambience,3.0,,"I found the ambience and rooms lovely at Fort Canning hotel. The personal touch or warmth was missing in their services. I found the food below average in the Salon restaurant. Both my meals lunch and dinner were bad. The waitresses are clueless about the menu and not comfortable with english. I would expect a 5 star hotel staff to have menu knowledge and at least be able to communicate. The breakfast was good though. Another hugely disappointing incident was use of mobile phones by house keeping staff in the corridor outside the room. It was annoying to be woken up at 7 while they were cleaning with their phone ringing constantly. Utter rubbish!
All in all I felt cheated for the money I spent didnt get me what i expected. I hope they improve."
,,Very relaxing,5.0,,"Right in the middle of the city, this historic point is a well preserved, lush and verdant park that is worth a visit if you‚Äôre interested in the history of Singapore or just want a break from the bustle of the city. Even on a Saturday it‚Äôs not very crowded."
,,Open space and green escape,4.0,,"Peaceful park with lawns, gardens, sculptures and cultural heritage. Hilltop location, nice views. Historical landmarks (includes the gate of the old fortress). Spice garden. Take a wander. Easily accessible and close to other attractions."
,,Sanctuary,5.0,,in the heart of the city next to Clarke Quay the lively and busiest nightlife in Singapore just a step to enter totally different atmosphere take a deep breath and feel the silence and walk back with new energizing feeling.
,,Educational in both history and greenery,5.0,,"We decided to do a walkabout because not only was there a new MRT station nearby but we‚Äôve never explored the location in our numerous visits to Singapore. It was amazingly refreshing being out in real clean fresh air amongst the greenery. The Spice Garden was interesting although it would benefit from more little explanation cards of the plant species. The best historically ‚Äúfind‚Äù was the Embankment Tour - tour guide Joanne gave a really good running commentary of the bunker and run-up to the surrender of the island, emotional is how I felt at the end of that tour. Well worth the $18 charge.
Only criticism we had was the offices to the National Parks were shut tightly and we had no way of getting our way around so based on the posted signs we eventually found what we wanted in a rounabout way! Considering it was a public holiday on our visit, very disappointed information from those well located offices (next to cafe) was shut tight!"
,,History,5.0,,"Very beautiful park with a lot of history about the settlement of Singapore and WW2, very interesting."
,,Green Lungs of Singapore,5.0,,"Went for a morning walk in Fort Canning Park which is easily reachable by Bus...it is a lush green oasis in the midst of modern Singapore architecture...easy climb by stairs or by a walking track with dense vegetation on both sides...many morning walkers come here..you pass next to Fort Canning Hotel & Battle Box..entry to the Park is free but entry to Battle Box is charged..at the top of the hillock is a Water Reservoir...no one is permitted to go there..you get a beautiful, panoramic view ...as you walk down the slope , you reach MRT station...worth a visit.."
,,Well worth the visit,4.0,,We decided to walk ‚Äòthrough Singapore‚Äô via the Forest Canning park and grounds. The area is certainly very interesting and certainly worth the effort to get there. We spent perhaps 2 hours wandering around on the way through to other areas. Recommended.
,,Great quiet walk in the hear of the city,4.0,,"In the hear of Singapore lies Fort Canning, known primarily as the location for British HQ during World War 2 prior to the British capitulation. Great tour of the underground HQ itself via Battle Box tours.

The hill itself is an elliptical path around the hill with various informative signs throughout, mostly historic in nature. In general a nice quiet route with some glimpses of the city through the high trees. Unfortunately, and this causes the downgrade, one can not go to the top of the hill for a much broader view as there is a wired off reservoir on the summit, with those nasty little signs showing an individual pointing a gun at another all around...unfortunate.

Well worth taking an hour out of your day for the hike..bring water."
,,Interesting visit,4.0,,Once I‚Äôd got up the numerous flights of stairs (which felt like I was doing some proper exercise!) you reach the top of the park and it‚Äôs quite pretty to look at. There are guided tours here if you wished to do one. Otherwise just park yourself on a bench and enjoy the serene surroundings! There are parts of the old fort still visible. Nice little park to be fair
,,Tour of history,5.0,,The Fort Canning Park is an iconic park and the area is really lovely. You'll get to learn a lot about the area and its significance once you tour the inside. It also has a few restaurants and i quite like the Indian restaurant there (Myras).
,,A nice park,4.0,,Fort Canning is a nice park. Be prepared for some climbing as it is mostly a hill. It has some interesting information boards about the history of the area.
,,Nice park...big!,3.0,,"First, it is just a park. But as city parks go it is a very good one, And quite large. There are lots of pavilions and remnants from fort that was here during WWII. Be aware that there are some steep sections with a lot of stairs, so you will get your walking in."
,,Much is missing unfortunately,3.0,,"I guess it is what it is and they are doing a great job of finding and preserving the past. Unfortunately compared to places like Melaka and Penang as well as some of the other old British colonies, much has been lost. I was unlucky that Battlebox wasn't open on a Sunday. It is still a pretty good spot to walk around and relax."
,,Interesting visit,5.0,,"My cousin suggested we visit this place, I wasn‚Äôt sure if our kids would take any interest, especially the younger one, he is 6, anyway we purchased the tickets for the battle box bunker tour . We were pleasantly surprised by the well organized tour and the knowledge of the person showing us around. What made it even more interesting is the quiz question at the end of the tour which our elder son (9 yrs old) answered correctly and won a great prize.
The park around that area is well maintained and great to walk around."
,,Lovely a quiet in the morning,4.0,,I took an early morning walk here when it was still cool. Access is up steps and there are plenty of shady places to rest if needed. The whole area is a very nice a quiet spot and the Battlebox is well worth a visit if you have time.
,,A must do if you have the time!,5.0,,Such a pleasant place for a wander amidst jungle foliage. Interesting trails and very well sign posted. Look out for names of local trees. Good views from the top.
,,Relaxing and peaceful,5.0,,"After our tour of the National Museum, we chanced upon this beautiful park while looking for a place to eat. It felt very peaceful and relaxing to just sit under the trees. There were only a few people about. Some are walking, others are jogging, and a handful are sitting in the benches taking in the view."
,,a peaceful oasis in the middle of the city,4.0,,"Fort Canning is like a breath of fresh air after the hustle and bustle of every day life. Located in the middle of the city, this park is like an oasis filled with lush greenery. It is better to come here early in the morning before the heat of the day makes it unbearable, and be sure to wear comfortable foot wear and bring drinking water. There are several historical and educational markers as well, which details the history of Fort Canning and describes some of the plants seen here. This is another side of Singapore and it's worth a visit!"
,,Breath taking,5.0,,"First you need to wear a comfortable cloth and a sport shoes, it is a long walk. Don't forget umbrella in case it rains out of sudden. Fort canning is a wonderful place to visit. It is part of history and is reserved beaufully. You learn a bit of history by visiting it.it us located near Singapore national museum. The collection of trees and plants is amazing. Fresh air, taste of history, greenery that relaxes the soul and mind. Thus place is a must to visit if you visit Singapore"
,,Nice place for a run,5.0,,Take a run here to forget about the city. Close by you can also see the fire house also. Great place!
,,Relaxing garden,4.0,,"On a hot day it was nice to sit in the park and relax for a bit. It is green and well manicured, which makes the walking trails throughout the park a nice experience with a young child."
,,A beautiful city park,4.0,,"If you are tired of the fast pace of Singapore and all of the concrete, steel and glass, make your way to Ft. Canning Park where they have beautiful walking trails complete with historical markers. It is much cooler in the shade of the many trees along the path, and you will see many people enjoying the park with picnics. Don't miss the Battle Box, which gives you a tour of the British command station during World War II."
,,Relaxing and Pretty,5.0,,Fort Canning Park is a lovely relaxing place in Singapore. Full of history you can enjoy the place just walking the trails or taking part in activities such as the Battlebox tour. Lovely and green and well manicured gardens make this a place worth seeing
,,Lovely park with interesting history,4.0,,Central location near Fort Canning MRT. Lovely green area with various walking tracks to explore. We did the Fort Canning Tour including the Battlebox. A great way to learn about the history of this interesting site.
,,Nice walk especially in the morning,4.0,,A place filled of historical items. A very well maintained park. There are activities like the battle box where you can know more about the time the British soldier defended Singapore.
,,Historic place,3.0,,"There has been a military fortress here, and now the place has been turned into a park. There is a military bunker that has been turned into a museum, and a palace. It is generally not a tourist attraction."
,,Great place to wander,4.0,,"If you enjoy history and want to learn a bit more about Singapore this is a great place to go. It‚Äôs actually right in the city and walking distance from the train station. It‚Äôs worth walking around at your own pace as there‚Äôs lots to see, read and admire. Could easily spend a few hours here exploring the place."
,,Not a normal tourist destination but a lovely location for a walk in a historic park,5.0,,"This was another one for the memory banks for me. Famous for its gates, historic, Colonial connection and the Battle Box it is another lovely public space in this city. We accessed it by the escalator near the National Museum which saves a bit of a climb in the heat. More popular with locals than tourists but I enjoyed the walk around."
,,Visit on Open Day,4.0,,"We visited while the park was running an open day (or I should say a number of open days) with a number of exhibitions, talks and stalls. We attended an in depth talk on orchids by an academic from the Botanic Garden, and viewed an exhibition on how FCP was going to change in the near future.

Other than this a walk around the park is very pleasant and quiet, and is not too large to involve long waking in the heat.There are a number of entrances/exits, so you can take your pick depending on where you have come from or where you are going next."
,,Many Spices Grow in one Place,4.0,,"The spice garden at Fort canning Park is an extensive sampling of many spice plants that are hard to find all growing in one garden. The spice garden alone should be given at least 2 hours if you want to learn about the spices and take the time to study the plants as well. There are different spices in bloom and with fruit at various times of the year so you may only see some of the fruit at a given visit time but there are short descriptions of the nature of the spice, how it is harvested, and how it is used. Some spice plants actually make several different spices from various parts of the plant or fruit. If you are interested in the use of spices and where they come from, this will be a great place for you to visit."
,,peaceful walk,3.0,,"Not much to do exactly, but was a pleasant walk around . Very quite and peaceful with no traffic noise."
,,A place of history.,4.0,,This old fort has been transformed to a centre for lots of activity. Its great to see the people of Singapore enjoying this place as well as tourists. Great exhibition and talk on Orchids and a display the way development is working.
,,Great Park for a hilly run,5.0,,I stayed at the Novotel hotel right beside this park. It was very convent for running in. Nice big paths with lots of hills.
,,A park which makes you love Singapore even more,5.0,,"This is a gem in the heart of Singapore. Excellent to walk in with a lot of history in it. Connected to Clarke Quay and the Dhoby Ghaut area, it‚Äôs a must visit location.

I would say a visit to Singapore is incomplete without a walk in the park or with your family, a picnic"
,,Lovely quiet walk in the middle of a tourist spot!,4.0,,"Great little park in the middle of a busy tourist area. Loads of plaques and boards telling you about the long history of the hill and later fort. Research tour times for the ‚Äúbattle box‚Äù as we just missed the start of one tour and in truth were a little hot and bothered to hang around until the next tour. We now know the times and will be heading back to make sure we do it.
Something for everyone from spice gardens, archeology, ancient and modern history through to just sitting on a swing listening to the plentiful bird song and breathing in the aromas from the plants etc."
,,Stepping out of the metropolis,5.0,,"There is something very tranquil and pleasant about the park, it really does make you feel like you are clear from the buzzing metropolis of down town Singapore. With its Colonial history and Victorian like walkways, it also makes you feel like your back in the motherland!

On both occasions I've visited I've made a point of walking the complete perimeter, it offers good views of the city, the historic government building at the rear (now a hotel) and Singaporean life.

Notable points of interest include an old light house, various historic cannons, Battlebox (a must visit), the old (old) Fort, the visitors centre (useful toilet and cafe) and of course local wildlife and foliage.

But the main attraction for me was the quietness and tranquility it provides, the noise of the birds and the smells of the flowers, and reflection to understand where you are, and maybe how far you have travelled to get there!"
,,Relaxing at the top..Fort Canning Park,5.0,,"Fort Canning Park, an iconic hilltop landmark has witnessed many of Singapore‚Äôs historical milestones. The hill once sited the palaces of 14th century Kings and served as the Headquarters of the Far East Command Centre and British Army Barracks. The decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942 was also made on the hill, in the Underground Far East Command Centre, commonly known as Battle Box."
,,Step back in time to reveal the history of Singapore,5.0,,The good thing is you can walk through from Orchard Road to Clarke's Quay and begin to understand the history of Singapore. there is the WW11 Bunker which has huge significance to the fate of the colony in WW11. the trees and walkways provide a degree of protection from the sun and as you get closer to Clarke's Quay there is Raffles House and an intriguing Lighthouse overlooking the Singapore river
,,Nice park but not a must see,3.0,,This is a lovely park and well kept. However I wouldn't say it is a must see whilst you are in Singapore especially if you are on a tight time frame. The park is lovely if you like parks I did enjoy a little stroll around here but did not spend too long as there is much better things to do in my own opinion. However if you are a park lover then go.
,,Fort Canning Park,5.0,,"This beautiful park consists of attractive, well kept walkways, well labelled specimen trees and framed historical notes. Approached by an escalator from a lower level, it is an oasis sitting above the city
on a hillside, with lovely views East and West, as well as towards Marina Bay. Raffles's original house is situated here, but is undergoing renovation at present, and is closed off to the public."
,,Historic park worth an hour or two,3.0,,"This park is located on a small hill overlooking Singapore and contains a range of artefacts relating to the history of Singapore from the 13th to the 20th century. A pleasant diversion for a hour or two from busy Singapore.

Nearest MRT station is now Fort Canning on the Downtown line."
,,"Nice park, not a must see attraction",3.0,,"We enjoyed a stroll around the park, our main purpose was to find the battle box attraction but the park in itself is pleasant enough for a half hour stroll away from the hustle and bustle"
,,"Very popular area, especially on Sunday afternoons",5.0,,"Extensive and very popular green area.
This hilltop park has a remarkable history, including the military headquarters of Colonial Singapore and a ""Forbidden area"" . With a restricted area reservoir at the top, plus a very upmarket hotel and many acres of attractive formal gardens / ornamental woodlands.
During the weekends it is a very popular courting spot especially with many local and immigrant couples who remarkably seem very keen on horticulture and exotic plants in particular."
,,Nice spot in the city,4.0,,"It is OK with some very pleasant views given how close you are to the city life, but there are many more places in Singapore which I would put as higher priority ‚Äì such as Fort Siloso on Sentosa for the war experience. I did not do the Battlebox, could not be bothered to wait the time for the next tour when I was there."
,,Be prepared with water,5.0,,"Beautiful park full of lovely walks, though to reach many parts you need to climb quite steep hills and/or staircases. Lots of interesting trees such as Banyan trees and great deal of interesting finds throughout the park, including the Battlebox."
,,Great park with history,5.0,,Well preserved historical park in the middle of the city. Great for history buffs. It is a decent climb uphill
,,Go green,3.0,,"This park is big, you can access it from clarke quay or dhoby ghaut. From dhoby gaut you can walk thru the under ground tunnel which is cool."
,,Relaxing !,4.0,,"If you want to get away from the busy life of downtown you can enjoy this wonderful green area in the center of the city. Lots of locals jogging and walking. The place is well manicured with some attractions, buildings and hotels. It is about a 10 minutes walk from the hotel Fullerton. The main attraction is the battle box for the fans of WW2. It was the comnand center of the british army ! Dont miss it."
,,"Long walk with hill side, good for weekend",4.0,,My weekend has been well spent here. Managed to have long walk up and down. It is pretty difficult to find this famous view - but finally I found it where is just opposite to dhoby ghuat mrt statiom.
,,Gentle but hilly stroll with real interest,5.0,,Plenty to see in this park from the bunker to the archaeology. The park has lots of information boards to help you understand the history. And also the spice garden. It was serene and pleasant on the day I was there although the bunker was closed until 1.30 and I couldn't wait that late. I think it may be a bit of a challenge to anyone who has mobility concerns although I would recommend contacting them first. I really liked this place. Raffles house and the lighthouse were architecturally interesting although they were not open to go inside when I was there. Lots of heritage trees to see. I didn't go into the art museum as I was short of time but it was spectacular from the outside. It's a little oasis in the heart of a busy city. Some good views too
,,Nice Park,5.0,,"Lots of History here , lovely space to have a walk around waiting for your Battle Box tour to start. Interesting History of early settlement"
,,Picnics in the park.,5.0,,Great space to walk around . Excellent pathways and trees to view. Good art situated along the walkways along with plenty of great spots to picnic and just chill out. Love going down to the Battle Box also.
,,One of my favourite bits of Singapore,4.0,,"I always try and talk a walk in Fort Canning park when in Singapore. A raised hill on the edge of Clarke Quay, Fort Canning manages to combine the best elements of city views, a lush green park, and a number of informative historical attractions. Better in the evenings than during the day (it gets hot), it is well worth a stroll if you are out and about in the area during the evening."
,,evening walk - central location and quiet,4.0,,"i just discovered how lovely this place is in the evening when i came for a walk. within walking distance from city hall mrt station, it is easily accessible. the steps are a good work out. the area is full of interesting plaques and it is quiet. good place to come for a picnic as well. public toilets are clean and there are a few restaurants."
,,An outdoor huge park,5.0,,"The area were huge, with many attraction from Art Center, Restaurant, Field, and attraction. It was an outdoor so you should traveled light, have some food and drink on your little back, and use a comfortable shoes & clothes."
,,Morning walk,4.0,,"Headed to Fort Canning for our first stop in Singapore. Great for a morning stroll, we didn‚Äôt do the bunker tour, however the plaques and info scattered around were plenty for us."
,,Picturesque place,3.0,,"Quiet, Serene and picturesque. Perfect for a picnic and cooler evenings. Great for pictures. Families enjoy picnics here. Houses some good restaurants as well"
,,Exhibitions to see,4.0,,"I have seen at least two excellent exhibitions here, the last being the UNECSO World heritage lego exhibition. When visiting the park ensure to walk through the herb garden too."
,,Lots on inclines and steps.,4.0,,"This was a mammoth effort for me being the unfit person. Thankfully you can do it at your own pace and rest when needed. Nice place for gatherings, picnics, to chill out but also good to learn about history."
,,Fort canning park...,4.0,,"Fort canning park is located in singapore, agrassy hilltop which has got historical importance. It's an area where many concerts happen in the city. A museum and art centre is located nearby. From this place Clarke quay is nearby which is exactly opposite to the calm atmosphere around here. People will come here, exercising themselves, and spend there leisure time in a calm environment. Altogether it's a recommendable place for the travellers in singapore."
,,Great Bunker tour.,5.0,,I was amazed how enjoyable this tour was about the surrender of Singapore. Highly recommend this Tour.. Good suggestion is to go on the Earliest tour at 9.45am as we only had 8 people.The next tour had around 30.
,,Canning Park,4.0,,"Visited this park in the evening. It has quite a steep climb up to the main area of the park. The park is really vast & it will take you hours to cover up on foot but perfect for an evening walk. They do offer tours to the Battlebox, however we arrived just after the last tour. The tour is priced at SGD 18 for an Adult & are supposed to last a little over an hour."
,,Great Park,4.0,,A great park to go for a walk around and enjoy the peace full surrounds. Just of Orchard road a very easy place to get to.
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"The hardest part is getting here walking, quite steep from any direction, but rewards the effort. Probably best when combined with a visit to the Battlebox, but still a great way to pass a couple hours. Lots of history. Plaques highlight significant places and events over the last 700 years.The main lawn in front of the big building was a graveyard. The ""contents"" were removed, many of the headstones line the walls around it, and give a sombre reminder of the abbeviated life expectancy for Western during the 19th century."
,,Historical stroll,3.0,,A nice stroll in a public park overlooking the city. It was also the place of the Singapore allies command center during the battles of WW2. Unfortunately the Battlebox can only be visited through planned guided tours.
,,Great park with excellent city views,5.0,,"Right behind the Singapore Museum, I highly recommend the walks, the views, easy access to Clarke Quay. There are beautiful tree and old cemetery markers dating to mid-19th Century. I'm sure on weekends there are often great events presented here. Also, enjoyed the old lighthouse."
,,Huge,4.0,,"This park is huge, it even has areas that has escalators to make your walk less tiring. Its pretty, has a good history, its interesting."
,,Fort Canning Park & Battlebox Tour,5.0,,"Highly recommend the 2.5 hour tour. Our guide Shar(?) spoke excellent English & was very knowledgeable. Got a bit of history on Singapore , the war & even life nowadays for Singaporeans. Bonus was the delicious bowl of vegetarian biryani at the restaurant at Fort Canning Park. A fair bit of walking & the park is on a hill, but not too strenuous.
I don‚Äôt know if all the guides are as good as Shar, but he really made the tour."
,,TAKE A TOUR BUS,5.0,,"We WALKED up the Fort Canning Hill and then all around the Fort, interestingly they now have a Hotel on it , The Battle Box we did not go in as we were too early for the tour, Bus tour is the way to go, there are old 9 pounder Guns (2) , Raffles first home , Plenty of walking , take a Hat or umbrella."
,,"Iconic Hilltop History and Today, Art",4.0,,"A hilltop landmark, Fort Canning is the site of many of Singapore's historic milestones: The location of 14th century Malay Kings, home of the Commander of the British Army and place where Singapore surrendered to the British in 1942. Today, it offers a lushly landscaped garden, top end hotel and manicured lawns for celebrations: weddings, Shakespearean plays and art exhibits. Just a few blocks up the hill from Orchard Road near Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, Fort Canning is wonderfully quiet respite from the shopping crowds."
,,Fort Canning Park,5.0,,This park is on the hop on hop off bus route so we thought that we would hop off to investigate this well mainted gardens. Beautiful maintained gardens with paths that climb higher and higher when walking around on them. Not a good park to visit if you have trouble walking or a bit unfit. Well worth a visit
,,A great escaoe,4.0,,"The perfect place to escape the heat and tourist hotspots in the city. Easily accessible by the MRT or for us, was half an hour walk from our accommodation. Some great photo opportunities for those looking for something a little different."
,,Great Historical Interest,5.0,,Had a leisurely walking tour around this entire area after visiting the Battlebox. Well worth it for anyone like myself interested in Singapore's history
,,Another great green space in the city,4.0,,"I was in Singapore for a workshop, and we spent one evening strolling down Orchard Road. We just happened to find Fort Canning Park. It was a great place to relax. I'm a history guy, so I enjoyed seeing this fort from the colonial era. I wish there had been a few more signs to help the public get the full story of the place. Singapore is a dense and busy city, but the government does a wonderful job of providing green spaces like Fort Canning."
,,Steps,4.0,,"A beautiful, green hilltop oasis in the city. We cut through on our way to the train station. Be warned this place is hilly!! There are lots of steps to the top. A great place to exercise for sure! Wish we had more time to explore. Beautifully maintained."
,,Bunker guided tour a must,4.0,,"On top of beautiful Fort Canning Park you will find the bunker tucked away near the exit on the Orchard Rd side of the hill. Buy your tickets for the guided tour which is the only way to see inside. The young guide who conducted our varied group of about 15 people was professional, knowledgeable, measured in presentation and very personable. As she conducted us from room to room, a terrible tale unfolded of English capitulation to a clever and organised enemy that resulted in the taking of Singapore. Rooms contain old equipment and realistic representations featuring excellent Madame Tussaud-like historical figures which help bring the tale to life. A throughly enjoyable and informative one-hour tour that is well worth the admission fee. Visit it before you go to the Changi museum to give Changi a better historical perspective."
,,Lovely park,5.0,,A beautiful and well-maintained park. A haven of quiet in the middle of Singapore. Absolutely lovely.
,,Lovely and peaceful in the middle of the city,4.0,,"We have been to Singapore on multiple occasions and never walked through the Park. Not any more! It is very easy to walk around with great signage talking about the history of the park. Although you are right in the middle of the city, it is incredibly peaceful."
,,Interesting Gardens with a Lot to Offer,4.0,,I was pleasantly surprised at what the park holds for tourists. I was sorry that I didn't know about buying tickets for the bunker which looked well worth visiting but entry is by tour only. Perhaps next time. The gardens in Singapore City are amazing. They are a credit to the Singaporeans.
,,Safe and refreshing,5.0,,"Very beautiful place, full of green. Nice pathways , vintage buildings , historical place with information given everywhere. I enjoyed my jogging there. Can't wait to visit it again!!!"
,,A park with history,4.0,,A must stop for who want to get a little history of Singapore's days as a British colony. Or if you just want to relax and have a picnic. Just don't litter.
,,So peaceful place,4.0,,"Very nice and quiet place. Walking at Fort Canning Park is really relaxing. We learned a lot about the history of Singapore and about spices.
You can admire so many type of plants which can't see easily in your life.
Fort Canning is near City Hall MRT."
,,Shade & Breeze,4.0,,"We were looking for somewhere that had shade, and a possible breeze, in the heat of Singapore. Fort Canning Park was just 12 minutes walk away from our accommodation so became the place of choice. It is sited on a hill; we entered the Park up never ending stairs, but on exiting we found that there is a sloping pathway on the Clark Quay side of the park that is much less strenuous. You will find lush greenery, much of it providing shade with places to sit, and at least a gentle breeze - I understand that Stamford Raffles built a house up there just to get the breeze. There is a huge amount of history surrounding you and if that is what you are into it will keep you happy for a long time. We just enjoyed the slower pace away from the crowds and the tranquility it afforded."
,,Big Park with greenery view,4.0,,Hiltop landmark of singapore city. If you love exercise you should go for it. It's very spectacular view from underground tunnel. It's also best for family.
,,Battlebox well worth a visit.,5.0,,Having been to Singapore on a number of occasions over the years I had never visited Fort Canning Park let alone the Battlebox bunker. I took the one and a half hour tour of the Battlebox and found it was extremely well presented by our very informative and knowledgeable guide Jerome. Lifelike models of all the key military personnel are shown at various locations to give it a more authentic feel.The bunker is air-conditioned. No photos are permitted. Highly recommend this tour to people of all ages.
,,Trip back in time,5.0,,"Fort Canning is a lovely Park with a lot of history. The focus of our visit was on the Battle Box , a bunker which was built during WWII. The tour guide was very knowledgeable. This is a great tour for the WWII buff! We came away with an understanding of the War in Malaya and Singapore and why the British lost. The tour lasted 1hr and 15 minutes. The bunker is air-conditioned. If you are visiting the rest of the Park, go early in the morning as it can get quite hot. The Park has much more to see... Raffles home, the old barracks, etc. i recommend it."
,,Cool garden walk,4.0,,"Luscious green garden with plenty of history and interesting plants. Depending on where you enter, there are a number of stairs and it can be a little difficult to navigate some of the winding paths in order to reach your chosen destination"
,,Very nice Sunday morning in the park,4.0,,"I had a very enjoyable morning walk here on a Sunday. It is quite and you have time and inspiration for reflection as well as a very nice possibility to enhance your knowledge of Singapore history.
Many posters with information is placed around the walking path. Are you interested in botanical information this is also displayed and educating. You can also use the park for a run."
,,Fort Canning Parks is a nice tranquil setting in the middle of the city,4.0,,"Fort Canning Parks is a lovely place to visit. I wanted to do the Battle box tour, but when I saw all the step the I had to walk down I realised I could not do the tour with my bad knee. SO disappointed."
,,A walk on the wilder side,5.0,,"Right in the centre of Singapore and bordering some key city sights this ancient hill sports a reservoir and some hidden gems such as the BattleBox, the Fort Canning Hotel and an art gallery. The park is a pleasant walking area and so close to the main streets."
,,Big park and nice place,5.0,,Park here is quite big and clean. Many trees and green place also the nice point to take the photo..
,,The gem of a place,5.0,,"The place is amazing. Nicely tucked away in the busy Singapore city. It offers lots of insights into the history, a wonderful walk in the spice garden & a nice art center. On the weekend, there can be too many people around though."
,,OK park,3.0,,It is near National Museum. You will find the sign when you exit the museum. The park is known for the place where british surrendered to japanese.
,,Can miss it,3.0,,"If you are on a short trip to Singapore, you can miss this location. If on a long trip too, you can miss it. If you are on a really long trip and have already finished seeing everything else and/or if you live close, you can surely spend some time here - may be take a book along. Its green, serene and quiet. If you expect to find a ""fort"", I'd think you'll be disappointed. There's hardly any fort there now. I saw that some music concerts are conducted there but I wonder how one can enjoy music if one is being bitten by mosquitos constantly.
Tip 1: If visiting, please cover yourself well as it has many mosquitos, natural to a place that is full of greenery.
Tip 2: Combine this location with a visit to one of the museums."
,,Large greens,4.0,,"Large greens in the middle of the city, nice views from The Hill, and the battlebox to visit as well"
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"Me and the wife went on a long walk that started in Tiong Bahru and ended up here. It's set on the top of a hill and is surrounded by lovely tree's and greenery. Inside there is a lovely green where you will see most people hanging out, there are some amazing tree's to sit under and read a book like i did or the museum to visit. You can also go into the underground bunkers (I didn't) and see some of the old cannons and rooms.

It's a lovely place. I recommend it"
,,This park is worth taking time out to visit,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a nice tranquil place to visit, get away from the concrete jungle and take your time walking around the park, its situated close to the city which makes it convenient everyone can easily walk there. Allocate yourself at least two hours to see and take in what the park has to offer. Don‚Äôt worry about the heat as there is plenty of shade and rest stops."
,,Not to be missed if you are near,4.0,,"It was on our way and we didn't regret going through this nice free park. Coming from the North, you'll see a tourist office which will give you a plan of the park which is usefull."
,,A peaceful beautiful garden so close to the city.,5.0,,"This park area is well worth a visit with no time constraint. Firstly go to the battle box to book your tour through this historical monument as it is generally booked out if you turn up just before. This gave a fascinating look into the battle of Singapore. Then wander around the gardens and museum. Have a cup of tea in the Hotel Fort Canning in the charming ""bar"" area, a very pleasant experience."
,,Filled with History; Difficult to Navigate,3.0,,"I visited Fort Canning Arts Centre for the Piece of Peace world tour running from 27 July to 3 September 2017. The exhibition mainly consisted of UNESCO world heritage sites built with Lego bricks, but also had Lego MOCs made by Singaporeans, as well as tubs of Lego bricks for visitors to tinker with. Overall it was an interesting exhibition that kept me engaged for an hour, but I felt the lighting did not showcase the level of detail in some creations.

I also attempted to check out the historical artefacts in Fort Canning Park, but found the park very hard to navigate. I ended up visiting the nearby National Museum of Singapore instead."
,,Short visit,4.0,,"We walked up through the park stopping to view the lighthouse and Raffles house, then went down again to access Clark Quay. Lots to read, shady and cool even in the midday heat, I just wish we had had more time and my feet not so sore. I think we'll visit again on our way home in a few months!"
,,Great Park,5.0,,"The history of this park is amazing. Be sure to take time to enjoy the tropical flowers, and stop by the World War Two battery."
,,A great break from the crazy of Singapore,5.0,,"I love this park. When the hustle of Singapore gets a bit much, take a stroll through Fort Canning. It is amazingly calm and quiet compared to what is just outside the walls.
There are lots of little pockets of information and history located all the way around, mixed with some beautiful plants and flowers.
I would advise going in late afternoon, when the heat has died down a bit, and make sure you wear bug spray, not for mosquitoes but for other little insects that bite."
,,Beautiful green oasis with a fascinating history,5.0,,"If you want to escape the hustle and bustle of Singapore by getting back to nature or if you're a history buff, then Fort Canning Park is the place to visit. The park is situated on a steep hill immediately behind Clarke Quay, so is very central and easy to get to. It's a reasonable size and some paths have a steep incline, which may be challenging for anyone with mobility issues. My overall impression was of green lawns, lush plants and lots of trees. There are also some impressive historical buildings dotted around the park as well as the WWII underground military operations bunker, now known as the BattleBox Museum, which is well worth a visit to do the highly informative 1 hr guided tour. Guided or self-guided trails through the park range from 0.6-2km in length."
,,Reccomend a visit,5.0,,"This is where Singapore was surrendered to the Japanese in WW II so has an amazing amount of history but further back than WW II. It is in a beautiful park with well kept grounds and flower beds. There are lots of different area to look at such as herb garden, archaeology dig, war memorial, bunker and lots more. There is an art gallery in the park with a delightful caf√© in which I would definitely recommend - especially the sundae's which cost $9 and worth every cent. The girl who was there when we attended was lovely and made an art work of every piece of food which she produced. The caf√© itself is very small but delightful, definitely recommend this and Fort Canning."
,,Love this Park,5.0,,Fort Canning Park is a peaceful oasis in the bustling bust city. Plenty of walking paths to enjoy and pleasant gardens.
,,Battlebox - a must visit if you want to go back to the historical days,5.0,,"The Battlebox is a former British underground command center in Fort Canning Hill. Built in the 1930s, it was used by the-then army that defended Singapore during WWII.

A great experience that brings back historical days alive. Before entry you watch a video that gives you the glimpse of the history and then you walk inside across the underground command center. It gave me a scary feeling when I went inside and realized how the days of the war had been for people who lived in those days."
,,Lovely place for a walk,4.0,,"This park is lovely for a walk or picnic, and to watch the birds. There is lots of historic things to see in the park, the Battle box being one of them, please note that you have to book before at the office/shop in the park."
,,Former center of colonial rule in Singapore and a fascinating site,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is located on a hill across the river from Singapore's CBD and very near to Raffles Hotel. To see everything there is a fair bit of walking involved (lots of stairs and ramps), but it is well worth it with a range of different things to see including one of the original lighthouses of Singapore, the main former residence of the Governor from colonial times and also some archaeological ruins. My one piece of advice is to go early in the day before it gets too humid and hot"
,,Beautiful oasis in a busy city,5.0,,"Walking through the park you gorget you are in a very busy city. The park is beautiful with lots of greenery and places to just sit and relax and enjoy the scenery. It is also where you will find the Battlebox, the WWII bunker under the hill used by the British as their command centre, and also by the Japanese after the surrender of Singapore"
,,Gotta Get Those Steps In,4.0,,"Whew, walking up all the steps is a good workout on a hot and humid day. The trees are awesome and the paths are well groomed. We saw some wedding pictures being taken and enjoyed watching families picnicking under the shady trees."
,,Well preserved park area close to the city,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is well worth a visit whilst in Singapore, with plenty of walking trails and interesting historical data about Singapore. I often walk home through the park as an indirect alternative to the busy River Valley Road. Just have to be a little careful of the mosquitoes, but otherwise this place is great to visit. On weekdays it's virtually empty."
,,Well maintained 'green lung' in central Singapore,4.0,,"Situated on a hill the park has a number of well maintained walkways with lots of directional signage to find your way around - obtain an Informative Brochure from your hotel, an information center or as we did in the Arts Center in the park itself to make for an informed enjoyable visit - lots of historical buildings and outdoor sculptures - beautiful trees and well maintained gardens - also features the Battelbox with guided tours of the WW2 military headquarters prior to the Japanese occupation - should be on your list of places to visit if you have more than a couple of days in this beautiful city"
,,Fort Canning Park,4.0,,"Good place for morning or evening walk, right in town. Quite a big place if one is willing to just explore and walk around and enjoy the scenery plus enjoying the fauna around."
,,Well preserved historical buildings pleasant to visit,5.0,,Very well preserved Park with the old British war buildings including the battle box. Lovely to see the historical buildings and the gardens are so well maintained. It was not at all busy in the park when we were there (weekday morning) and very pleasant to stroll around. Be aware that there are quite a few stairs to climb as the park is elevated so if mobility is an issue then perhaps a taxi to the entrance better than using the MRT to get here.
,,For history buffs or if you like a nice park,5.0,,Fort Canning is a wonderful place to visit in Singapore. From the high vantage point is I found it to be quite tranquil. A wonderful spot just to sit and relax or learn more about Singapore through the history on display.
,,Beautiful park in the city,4.0,,A beautiful park in the city. Saw numerous people picnicking. It's quite and lovely and I came from Hill Street and climbed the stairs.
,,Great for a walk,4.0,,This is such an oasis in the city. It's a lovely open space to walk and easily connects to Clark Quay. There's lots of interesting historical bits of info. My only regret is I didn't get to spend enough time there.
,,The history of Singapore in 3 hours.,5.0,,"The hill on which Fort Canning sits has long been associated with the dominant political entity in Singapore. The tour gives a brief history of the site with a particular emphasis on the fall of Singapore during WW2. Our tour guide was very engaging and we had a wonderful afternoon. The tour includes a tours of the bunkers where the defence of Singapore was planned and ultimately where the decision to surrender was made.

Our tour guide made sure we were in the shade as much as possible during the outdoor part of the tour but Singapore is generally very warm so make sure to bring plenty of water with you."
,,A pleasant walk in the park,4.0,,This is the site of a historical British Military base from the days of empire. Wr walked around the extensive gardens where you can see a lot of rare botanical and arborial specimens in a sylvan setting.
,,Heartfelt experience,5.0,,Stumbled upon this historic place after climbing many stairs (we later found out there was an easier way of getting to this place)! Can not recommend this tour highly enough. Our guide Joanne was extremely informed and well spoken and brought the battle box to life. Changed my opinion on the surrender of Singapore and gave me goose bumps throughout the tour. Definitely worth setting aside 1hr and 15 mins to this guided tour.
,,Great Park Tucked into the city,4.0,,"Great art, bird watching, plant identification and all around a great place for a stroll just minutes from Clarke Quay and the National museum of S'pore. Worth a visit"
,,The park is great and the hotel is also lovely,4.0,,"The park is really well maintained and I found the hotel stunning too. The only setback is the steps. It feels grand but turns out to be a nuisance to walk all those steps in 4 inch heels if you plan on attending an event in the hotel or going for a meal. Otherwise, the food in the hotel was outstanding and I love the lush green surrounding. Almost like mammoth park in the middle of the city. Who doesn't like greenery?"
,,enjoyable,5.0,,"though all of Singapore is a park or a garden or a garden in a park, Fort Canning offers even more. There are historic buildings in it, public art, beautiful walk ways, a temple, botanical exhibitions and more. Don't miss it.
and don't miss the Battle Box"
,,Nice urban park,5.0,,Beautifully maintained park with some historic buildings set in it. Well worth a stroll around and also some great views of Singapore.
,,Amazing Park,5.0,,Amazing Park had a great time! Locals here are amazing people. It was refreshing to be in a beautiful quiet place.
,,"Quick, and beautiful walk",5.0,,"its up a hill, so you have to climb to it no matter where you come from. that said, it was some beautiful trees, and great life."
,,Romantic quite place for a walk,3.0,,We got married in Hotel Fort Canning so we are no stranger to the park which is a stone's throw away from the hotel. You will see couples taking wedding photos here too.
,,Lovely oasis in a busy city,5.0,,"Once you brave the climb up the incline in the heat (this is Singapore after all), the place is a real oasis.

Apart from the ever present sound of new construction, all you can hear are the jungle noises .

Wonderful trails around the water storage, well signposted and great views of the city.

Great place to get away from the hustle and bustle."
,,Historical Hill,5.0,,"This is a very interesting tourist site, with a rich history dating back 700 years ago, from when it was called Bukit Larangan or Forbidden Hill. It was previously occupied by Malay kings for their residences, then used by the British as governors' houses, and finally utilized as a military area until the Second World War.

Now it is a tourist spot offering many interesting facts for visitors to Singapore. My first trip to Fort Canning Hill caught my attention entirely as I also visited the Battle Box, the main underground facility of the Malaya Command where the surrender of Singapore in WWII was decided.

I discovered many things about Fort Canning Hill, thanks to the different informative boards spread out at strategic spots along the walking and jogging trails.

At many areas around the hill, you will have good bird's eye views of Singapore's central business district and entertainment areas, including Orchard Road, since you are on top of a 60-meter slope. Such a sight!

I enjoyed seeing many heritage trees about the park. It would have been enjoyable to approach the reservoir, too, but public access is currently not allowed. Other notable areas include Raffles' House, the Fort Gate, and a 9-pound cannon which was meant to protect the fortress from sea attacks.

You will definitely enjoy your visit to this park, because you won't just enjoy the sights, but also learn about the history of Fort Canning Hill."
,,Lovely spot,4.0,,"Take a few hours to walk through this park, not a major attraction but has somevery interesting features. Make sure you book onto the bunker tour, this was a fantastic guided tour through the bunker that played an important part at the conclusion of the Japanese invasion of Singapore. Lovely strolling paths through majestic trees. So glad we went."
,,Nice quiet cool place for a stroll,4.0,,"A true gem of a park right inside the city. Cool shaded walkways provide a relief from the hot sun. A few historical cannons, gates and underground bunkers to see. Well worth a visit."
,,Unexpected find,4.0,,I came across Fort Canning accidentally as I hadn't heard of it. What a discovery! There were so many unique 'finds' ranging from the Spice Garden to the Battlebox to the archaeological dig to the cemetery and the list goes on. While the pathways went everywhere throughout the 'forest' type areas and the open areas the signposting was a bit confusing at times. In a way though this added to the adventure as when tryin to get to a certain feature I'd stumble across a different feature that wasn't necessarily signposted to be where it was.
,,Cool spot for the hot days,4.0,,We found the Park a nice place to explore after arriving in Singapore as the weather was so hot & the park with its many trees offered a respite for a while. There are many paths to wander & of cause the fort itself to visit. Lots of interesting things to see including the only outdoor escalator I've come across & carved walls detailing history of the Island
,,"One of the best place to walk, run and relax",5.0,,"A wonderful green island in the middle of Singapore, surrounded by museums. It's both ideal for running (if you like the hilly tracks) and for secret dates during nighttime.

Also good place for relaxing under the enormous trees.

They have little botanic gardens, and many paths and stairs."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Absolutely beautiful park in the center of the city. There are so many huge trees, that must have taken years and years to grow to that size. This area was one of the key strongholds for the British army when they were fighting against Japan for sovereignty of Singapore. There are a lot of information boards which tell you about the history and some relics such as canons and lighthouses."
,,A nice place to visit and quiet.,4.0,,Put on your walking shoes take water grab a map and enjoy you visit. You have an old fort. Raffles built his home on the hill nice view of Singapore. Plenty of information boards. Nice place to spend a few hours.
,,feedback,1.0,,"I was there 5days and it looked nice but room service was really poor.
When I came out from room hotel smelled like grandmothers kitchen.

When I asked for umbrella, They didn't have.

There is LONG way to be on "" Good "" hotels list!

We spent 600 SGD for room service and 2 days later they came back with additional invoice 10,50 SDG.

Just doing international money transfer, it costs more!

Disappointed!"
,,An absolute delight for a walk,5.0,,"It is so lush and green, absolutely beautiful! There are so many huge trees, that must have taken years and years to grow to that size. Yet all this in the middle of the city."
,,Good for a day trip with the family,4.0,,"It's hot so wear a hat and sunnies, try and head over earlier or later in the day. Good for a family trip to walk around get a mini hike in going up the stairs."
,,Interesting but not a must see,3.0,,"This area was one of the key strongholds for the British army when they were fighting against Japan for sovereignty of Singapore. There are information boards which tell you about the history and some relics such as canons and lighthouses. The park is free to enter.

The real attraction around this area is the Battlebox museum, so if you want to find out more about the history of Singapore, I would really recommend this."
,,A Walk in the Park,4.0,,A nice tranquil park to walk around in the midst of a bustling commercial zone. A venue for open air concerts as well.
,,Beautiful place for an hour walk in a prime location,5.0,,"So close it is from Clare Quay but a beautiful garden walk. A hour walk was extended to more than 2 hours due to some nice showers. Like any other location in Singapore, we could manage the visit using the map that was self explanatory. It was amazing to see a few left-over Madras thorn trees. We had been to this place during end of May 2016, it was evening and end of it went for dinner in Clare Quay."
,,bit of a hidden gem,5.0,,"visit this area for peace and tranquillity. situated in the heart of city hall, accessible at various points. take a leisurely walk around the hill and enjoy."
,,Excellent morning stroll,5.0,,We arrived about 9.50 and setting in the Colonial self guided tour (downloaded the pdf). It said 45 mins but we spent 2 hrs wandering around ... it was great. Then we walked on down to the Raffles shopping centre and had lunch at the food court - $21 for 4 lunches!
,,Good walk in the park,4.0,,Walked from the hotel and a wee bit hot and sweaty around noon. Nice and quiet area showing part of Singapore's heritage in the early 1900's. Good area for jogging.
,,A calm oasis by the city centre,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a quiet oasis atop a hill immediately to the north of Clarke Quay. There are soaring rainforest trees, a spice garden, well sign-posted leafy walks and views over the city, and to Marina Bay. there are also fortifications, an underground former command centre and a characterless cafe deep inside the main building. The park is the thing. Well worth the short climb up the steps to the top."
,,Nice Public Park,4.0,,"This park is located right in the city, next to the National Museum. I had a nice relaxing walk and found many interesting ""free exhibits"" dotted around the park. There is even an archaeological dig up the hill. Worth a visit!"
,,Nice escape from the city,4.0,,There are plenty of trees and greenery here. The park is on a giant hill very close to the Singapore National Museum. I believe the fort itself was built in 1861. The old structures remain and are cool to see if you're a history buff.
,,"Good for a quick hour walk, some views",4.0,,"The loop around the park is a nice hour stroll. Longer if you want to visit the hotels or military museum. Being one of the new high points there are a few views. The various historical spots are well labeled (English only). Local plants well labeled.

Also an easy walk to many restaurants.

Not much shelter if the rains come."
,,Glad I spotted this park,5.0,,A bit hilly but many information notices detailing the history and sights to be seen within the park make this great. Get there in the morning when it is not too busy with tourists or too hot.
,,A wonderful park,4.0,,Worth a walk around to enjoy this lovely environment. The tropical trees and plants are beautiful and the park is very neatly manicured.
,,A history lesson in a lovely tropical setting,4.0,,"A fairly easy walk - for those used to the tropical climate. A must for history buffs, with several interesting landmarks. I particularly liked the Governor's House on the hill, where Sir Stamford Raffles once lived. A very peaceful place."
,,A beautiful walk,4.0,,This park is such a beautiful walk sourounded by manacured green gardens. The considerable number of steps to the top are the added bonus to your fitness regime. Raffles house shows how the original view has been covered by progress This walk is great
,,This is a fabulous place to spend a few hours and the Battlebox is a must.,5.0,,"I went to Fort Canning Park primarily to visit the Battlebox Bunker (See my separate review on this fabulous attraction and tour) but there is also plenty else to see in this fantastic tranquil hilltop park. Make sure you go and see the Old Christian Cemetery, The Spice Garden, the Keramat (the tomb of the first settler in Singapore - Iskandar Shah in 1390), the Gothic Gates and the old Fort Gate, and the old fort barracks which is now the Fort Canning Centre. This is such a history rich place and so peaceful too, well worth a visit for around 3 hours when in Singapore."
,,Make sure you have acclimatised first...,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a strange one - from the southern approach you are presented by a seemingly never ending set of steps, but take your time - the view is worth it from the top. The park contains the flagpole that was used to signify sovereignty - this is where the Japanese flag replaced the British flag after the fall of Singapore. Next to this is the original lighthouse for when the harbour was much closer to the hill before all the land reclamation. Behind this (and up more steps) is Sir Stamford Raffles' bungalow. The reservoir at the top of the park is restricted, but walk further and you get to the two huge buildings that used to be the barracks for officers and men of the British Army - now hotels. Between these is the remarkable Battlebox, where the defence of Singapore was managed, and the surrender finally agreed. In the rest of the park there are secluded shrines, huge and majestic Rain Trees, and a fascinating herb and spice garden. Well worth a visit if you want a quiet stroll as the park is usually pretty quiet (probably because of those steps!)"
,,A good place for a walk,4.0,,"We didn't realize there was an underground bunker tour that looked interesting. Beyond that it is a nice place to walk around in the morning or late afternoon on your way to Clarke Quay or the malls on Orchard Road. It is also right behind the Singapore museum, and it would be worth visit if you are going to the museum."
,,Not worth the 48th place in top attractions list,3.0,,"Its just a park to roam around for residents or locals. Not much to see for tourists, apart from the few good locations for photographs. You can skip this one, if you are on a short trip, or just go for an evening stroll if your hotel happens to be nearby, because it is very close to an entrance of clark quay."
,,Interesting park for walking,4.0,,"I pass through here quite often on the way home from work - a good way to escape the traffic and enjoy a bit of nature. Quite a few old buildings to see inside the park too, and now a lot more information on the history of Singapore also. In the early evenings on a weeknight the park can be quite peaceful with very few people around. But on the weekends it can be busy, especially if the weather is nice. Well worth a visit if you're in the vicinity."
,,Get into the park!,5.0,,A lovely lush garden visit to recharge after too much city. Just enjoy the beautiful surroundings and keep an eye out for squirrels.
,,Peaceful and well maintained,4.0,,This is a lovely quiet park in the middle of the city. It is steep in some places but worth the climb. We didn't realize that we had to pay to get into the Battlebox and unfortunately didn't have time to go on one of the tours.
,,Quiet and peaceful park,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park was easily accessible from our hotel, The Park Hotel at Clarke Quay, and we decided to make this our first port of call on a day of touring the city on foot. After climbing the steps to the top in the humid morning heat, the shade of the paths that wound their way around the hill were more than welcoming. It would have been nice if there were benches to sit, relax and enjoy the peace and quiet of the park, but we didn't manage to find any. We admired the towering trees and read the history of the lighthouse in the centre of the park, before descending the slope on the other side to continue with our walk towards Raffles Hotel."
,,Tranquility in the city,5.0,,Great place for some peace and quiet - relaxing park with lots of history. If you get the chance visit Battlebox - a must see Singapore attraction.
,,Solo walk in the park,4.0,,"Easily assessible by foot. There were some steps to climb, since it is up on a hill. But once you've arrive at the top, it's so peaceful and quiet. It calms your nerves.

Many places to stop by just to take a rest. Lovely ""swings"" for friends and families instead of the usual park benches (which are also available).

Breathe in the fresh air and take in the sights of Singapore scrapers.

I enjoyed it. I hope you guys too!"
,,Beautiful park in the middle of the city.,5.0,,"Great for walks or runs. Visited the battle box museum, where the surrender to the Japanese by the British was signed. Was very interesting."
,,Herbs garden,4.0,,An interesting place to see the different types of herbs that can be grown in Singapore. Most times we just buy from the shops.
,,Facinating visit away from the trafic and the crowds,4.0,,This hill fort garden area seams to get missed off from many tourist agendas but it is a super self guided place to spend two or three hours. Information boards throughout the park tell the story of the long history of this place and include the war years with the underground war rooms available to visit on a guided tour.
,,Battlebox WW2 bunker - thought provoking and informative guided tour,5.0,,Our guide Eisen really made this guided tour for us. He was very knowledgeable. The tour is about the final days of British rule as the Japanese came down through Malaysia and took Singapore in 1942 in only 55 days after landing 800kms away.
,,A green oasis in the middle of Singapore with lots of nature and a bit of history,5.0,,"Fort Canning Park is located very conveniently in the center of Singapore, right next to one of the major museums, near Orchard Road as well as within walking distance to Clarke Quay. There is some marvellous vegetation to be seen, along with some signage as to what you are looking at. There is a Visitors Center and a 'Battle Box', which explains WW II from an Asian point of view. Very well made and interesting! One one side is a row of very old gravestones, as this site served as a cementery for a while. You could go to this park for a picnic, if you're comfortable with the humidity!"
,,Oasis in the city,4.0,,"Visiting park in the foreign city is one of my favorite activity, fort canning was the nearest park to my hostel at that time, i visit at weekday and almost at noon, but because the park is so full of big tree i didn't feel the heat at all, by the name of the park you can tell you have to climb a little and break a little sweat... There are several monument and the building nearby have art exhibition at that park, overall this is one of my favorite park in Singapore :)"
,,Took an evening stroll with the wife,3.0,,Not as pleasant as Pearl Hill though but plenty to experience on spices; fruit plants; vegetations; generally you can learn a fair bit from just walking around the park. We were not going to the museum but just wanted to see what's in the park.
,,A little oasis in the centre of Singapore,4.0,,"Situated on a hillside, so you will have to do a bit of climbing. this park is well worth a visit for an hour or two. There is some interesting historical information around the site, some contemplative pieces of art and lots of interest for the horticulturalist. Particularly liked the new herb garden, with all specimens impeccably labelled. The whole site is really well maintained and very clean. It's very popular with locals on a Sunday who like to picnic"
,,Nice area in middle of the city...,5.0,,A really nice location for a walk and despite not being the biggest park it is full of wonderful information regarding the history of the area and the park in general. Be mindful that if a storm is coming its not wise to go into the park as it tends to get hit by lightning!
,,Historical Information,4.0,,Great place to take the family and enjoy walking through nature while getting some history at the same time.
,,"Very pretty, be prepared for the stairs",4.0,,"Beautiful and peaceful. Lots of stairs to climb on a hot day, so we really enjoyed the cold gelato at the Raffles house!"
,,Truly lovely park,5.0,,"Whether you want to stroll, walk the dogs or go for a jog, the park is perfect with shady paths, lovely trees, historical fort walls and the BattleBox to visit."
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,The Batle Box tour is a must do if you are interested in the history of Singapore. The 90 minute guided tour is informative and just walking through the former central command headquarters for the British and Allied Forces in the last days before the fall of Singapore is fascinating. You can book the tour through the kiosk in Fort Canning Hill park and the tour guides clearly have a passion for the history of Singapore providing our group with plenty of anecdotes and getting us to think about the events that shaped history. We followed our tour with a stop for the high tea at the nearby Fort Hill Hotel which was the former HQ for the British forces. An amazing place to step back in time.
,,Fascinating tour,5.0,,"The tour is an intriguing insight to Singapore's fall during World War II. The information presented and the displays offer an excellent depiction of the final days before the Japanese invasion. Our tour guide, Eisen, was impeccably informed and knowledgeable. Certainly worth a visit for those interested in history and an insight to Singapore's heritage."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"So much of Singapore's history is linked to the lovely site. The gardens are picturesque, this is a truly lovely place for a gentle stroll on the beautifully maintained paths."
,,"Greenery, shady and tranquility",5.0,,"I attended a Hindu ceremonial wedding at a temple nearby and strolled my way to this park after the wedding lunch. It was scorching hot that afternoon but the lush greenery of the park provided the natural shade for my relaxation.

I had not been here for a long, long time. But the tranquility and serenity in the neatly sculptured park was seductive and sedative. For a moment, I drowned myself in that moment of peacefulness. I heard the bird chirping, saw a butterfly among the flowers admired the historic architecture of the symbolic lighthouse and nearby monumental structures that survived since the British days and through the Second World War. I saw newly wed couples poised for photography in the beautiful gardens outside the Registry of Marriages.

It was away from the hustle and bustle of the city but this hidden gem of oasis is located right in the city. I love this park, love the tranquility and enjoy every peaceful moment in her greenery."
,,Singapore Culture,5.0,,"You can just walk around and take in the tranquility, its set on a hill so a bit of a climb but well worth it. The Battlebox is located inside the park as well. Refreshments are available."
,,Beautiful park and historical sights,4.0,,"Fort canning park is accessible from many areas, we got there via Clarke Quay, and there were a few works on the edge of the park where they are making a new SMRT area i believe. If you are keen there are a lot of steps or you can wander along the paths. For people with disabilities, maybe catch a cab to the top and skip the climb."
,,Enjoyable run path in the city. Don't miss the Battlebox tour!,5.0,,"Enjoyable run path in the city. Went there for morning runs couple of times with sets of stairs ideal for hike training.

Don't miss the Battlebox tour. It's a guided tour on underground bunker used in WW2. We had Mel as our tour guide. She did an amazing job! Would definitively visit fort canning park again!"
,,Battle Box Tour - a deep dive in history,5.0,,Under Fort Canning Park was the British underground bunker built in the lead up to the Second World War. We undertook a 90 minute guided tour that last close to two hours. The focus of the tour is the part it played in the lead up to the surrender of Singapore in1942. The facility is being developed to allow self guided tours in the near future. An amazing insight into a significant point in Singapore's history
,,Such a huge place to walk..,5.0,,"be prepared to walk 1-2hrs, good to exercise as well hehehe =) nearest MRT to alight is D.Ghout MRT station.. its just 8mins walk from Fort Canning Park, try to be here before 6pm if not it will get pretty dark by 615pm or so... Unless your together with a partner or friends ya. For myself I went solo for a brisk walk, so as I took my own sweet time tho... =')"
,,Beautiful Park in the City,5.0,,The park is huge and has a lot of historical sites and information inside. Great place to relax and lots of photo op as well. Beautiful place. The Registry of Marriages is also located here.
,,"Peaceful, beautiful park",5.0,,Good for a nice quiet walk under the trees with several historical artifacts place along the way. Relax and learn about some of Singapore's history. Since it's on a hill you will also get some nice views over the city.
,,A peaceful oasis,5.0,,"Fort Canning Park is great as both a place to relax and also to learn about Singapore's history. There is the Battle Box and the archeological dig site, plus the walls and cannons of the actual Fort Canning.

The only frustrating thing about Fort Canning Park is that there aren't really any options for eating in the park, so either don't come at lunch time or bring a picnic.

We always enjoy our visits to Fort Canning - but do remember the mosquito repellant!"
,,Fascinating tour and wonderful staff,5.0,,"Having been disappointed that the Old Ford factory ( Japanese headquarters) was closed for refurbishment and having no time to go to Changinmuseum, I only had an hour to indulge my love of ww2 history. But it was well worth it. Brilliant story telling and reveals by the tour guide and a real sense of the predicament of Percival. Staff charming about my amateur knowledge from films and books - Tenko, a town like Alice and the rising sun. Loved the myth busting they save until the end. Would be great to see them build on this and add sections on the occupation."
,,The Battle Box,5.0,,The Battle Box had re opened since my last visuit to Fort Canning. The battle box was the underground military head quarters build into Fort Canning and used during the world war two. Book the one hour tour and listen to the fanatstic tour guides summary of the capitulation of all allied forces too the Japanese.
,,Peaceful walk.,5.0,,If you don't mind a few steps you should definitely take a wander through this park. I recommend you take an umbrella on a hot day to ward off the sun and extra humidity from over hanging greenery.
,,"Quiet, beautiful park with lovely trees",4.0,,"Beautiful nature in Singapore. This park was lovely we walked through it before heading to Orchard road. Peaceful and filled with beautiful trees. If you are in the area, do take a walk around it. We visited in Jan 2015 but cannot change the year."
,,Lovely park to visit or go for a jog,5.0,,"Such a great park to visit for a quiet walk, a quick jog or visit one of the many events that are being held here. Over the years we've seen Snow Patrol, Neon Lights, Films at the Fort and a few Shakespeare's here and the location never disappoints."
,,Quiet oasis,5.0,,"This park is a quiet oasis in the middle of Singapore. A lot of green, many interesting plants. Make sure to visit the spices and herbs garden where you'll find a lot of explanations to all the different plants. Nice to spend some time there."
,,Nice walk in the park,4.0,,"Made my first visit on 25th Nov 2016 after 30 years.
Enjoyed my walk with a group of friends exploring the spice garden and the Archeological Dig Exhibition site. We found out how rich Singapore history was back in those days.

We also saw the replica of the Fort Canning light house which is no longer in use now.

Great place to bring our children to share with them about Singapore in the old days."
,,Interesting History,4.0,,Enjoyed a couple of hours walking around Fort Canning Park. Well worth a visit. Make sure you see wall with the carvings.
,,Good for a visit,4.0,,"Open space, lush green gardens with plenty of history to read about right across the hustle bustle .."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"If you take my route up the hill on a hot day, you will probably perspire a little as well. But, it's well worth the effort. There are beautiful trees and plants, ponds and wildlife, not to mention some lovely buildings, with information notices galore. The views from the hill aren't special - it's not that high, but there is plenty to keep people like me snapping away within the park. The art gallery looked particularly good, but sadly it was closed."
,,Brilliant Battle box tour,5.0,,"After enjoying a wonderful walk around this superb park we learnt of the guided tour, scheduled throughout the day, of the Battle Box - a museum to remember the surrender of Singapore in WW11. We paid a small fee for the 1.30pm tour which lasted one hour twenty minutes. This must have been the biggest bargain we had all the holiday! WOW that guide really brought the events to life and gave us every detail possible - he was excellent! The inside of the Battle box is very well laid out and a lot of hard work has gone into recreating the rooms, equipment and models to enhance the information given by Eisen Teo our wonderful guide. This is a must for anyone visiting Singapore."
,,Not everything here was lost.,4.0,,"The park is famous as the location of the Battle Box ‚Äì the location in which the decision was made to surrender during World War 11. The Park is an impressive collection of buildings including the National Museum of Singapore, the Fort Canning Park Hotel, an excavation site and several other interesting little spots. These are connected by an extensive walk-way and lots of fresh gardens including some magnificent old trees."
,,Jungle in the City,5.0,,You can walk around or over Fort Canning hill. The sounds of the City are rapidly lost as you enter the trees and the noise of the jungle predominates. Not surprisingly it is hot and humid and depending on where you are there are quite a few steps to climb.
,,Really nice place to go checkout,4.0,,"Steeped in history this Fort has canons, gatehouses under ground bunkers you can explore and archeological dig. The paths that wind up and across this park like area are beautifully kept and offer great views and lots of fauna and wildlife. There are lots of different areas to this park, play grounds, spice gardens & sculptures you name it and it pretty much has it.
Really enjoyed walking through here. Nice surprise and well worth a visit."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"We found ourselves with a morning to fill before leaving Singapore and having checked out of the hotel we made our way to Fort Canning Park. We were surprised by what we found, the history, the pleasant walks and the various trails you can follow. We really enjoyed the history,trying to look to the harbour through overgrown trees and trying to visualise how things were when the habour was open and very busy.

There's the Terrace,the lighthouse, the walks to the Battlebox museum, which we didn't go in due to time constraints but looked really interesting and then past Fort Canning Green. We had an excellent time."
,,Remnants of WW2,4.0,,Take in the sights of some of the areas which were fortified in preparation of the Japanese soldiers coming towards this part of the island. Spot the keramat and cannons still in placed. A walk into Singapore's history.
,,Peaceful park,5.0,,Just a short distance from all the hustle and bustle of Singapore the park is well worth a visit. Picturesque views are available with lots of trees and birds.
,,Calling nature lovers!,4.0,,"Take a break from the hustle of Singapore and enjoy the delightful Fort Canning Park. Walk around and check the various sites in the park including the Spice Garden, Sally Port and the Old Christian Cemetery, or take a break and chill out on Fort Canning Green. Popular with locals and tourists alike, a stroll around Fort Canning Park is a must on when in Singapore"
,,A morning jog under shades of trees.,3.0,,I went here to do my morning jog as it is located near my hotel. The area has a circle jogging track. A bit creepy while you reached a place called Keramat. I think I will take another route instead og going into the park.. :)
,,If you love walking...thn you should visit this,4.0,,Fort Canning Park provides an excellent walk for nature lovers with rare trees and plants across the park...it is quite well maintained and clean and becomes really nice just after the rainy season. You can enjoy the colonial architecture and has lots of information on WWII. A must visit but go there only if you have minimum 3-4 hours to spare. If you are tight on your schedule thn avoid it.
,,the beautiful architecture,4.0,,"There's a guided tour if you are interested in knowing more about the WWII battlebox. Singapore has once been occupied by the Japanese and this should be a good tour to know about how the departed has fought in protecting it. For me just to look at the architecture already makes my day. One of the buildings have been converted to a museum. You also get to see the Hotel Fort Canning which is a very common place for wedding ceremonies and banquets, as the registry is just a walk away. Walk a few more minutes down the road and you'll get to visit the Philatelic Museum,"
,,Interesting,4.0,,We very much enjoyed our visit that included a guided tour of the WW II Battlebox. The tour was a little over an hour. We left with a good understanding of the fall of Singatore to the Japanese in World War Two.
,,"Amazing experience, lots of information and great setting",5.0,,"Amazing experience Lots of information on boards around the park Also, a peaceful setting with great views of Singapore. Great place to chill out"
,,Good relief from the crowds in a historical setting,4.0,,"The closest park to the city centre and has a lot to offer but again like most of the other parks,it would take quite a long time to cover it all. That's hard to do in the heat. Best to get a flavour or take one particular aspect and just visit that area. There are quite a lot of shaded areas and places to sit and relax but you start to crave air con and the shops on Orchard road may be calling. Hard to get the impression of how it would have looked all those years ago before the development of Singapore because the sea is a lot further away and all the skyscrapers are now in the way."
,,Ordinary Garden,3.0,,We visited this place in the evening when it was dark. Just an ordinary garden and did not enjoy much. Though the garden is huge and we walked a lot in the garden.
,,Very nice walk in the city,5.0,,"Walked through the park at night time, beautiful views from the top and some beautiful structures and artwork scattered throughout. Probably not a must do while in Singapore but was a lovely stroll after dinner!"
,,Still as nice,4.0,,The last time I visited this place was >13 years ago. It's really well maintained even though >13 years has passed. It is pretty accessible as it's close to the start of Orchard road. This is where Singapore's history comes alive and is a great place to escape from the city.
,,The headstone wall at Fort Canning Park,4.0,,"We were walking through Fort Canning Park en-route to Peranakan Museum and we came across these headstones in the walls, which were a fascinating read on times gone past.

It's a lovely park and I only saw a small bit of it, it seems there's a bit more to see when I return next time."
,,Relaxing walk,5.0,,"Walking around in this area on my way to the Battlebox museum, I was pleasantly surprised to come across some beautiful trees from all around the world.Set around the reservoir in the heart of Singapore,it is well worth the visit"
,,Easy access for chill out,4.0,,"Once entered the park, the vibe suddenly changed. It suites for a quick escape from hectic urban life. It takes less than 5 mins walking from Dhoby Ghaut MRT stn or opposite Clarke Quay bus stop. Minus 1 star from overcrowded coz it is famous among tourists and pre-wedding photo-shooting."
,,Nothing to Shout About,3.0,,"Fort Canning Park, as with many local attractions, is small and quaint and really worth visiting if:

(a) you have a lot of time to spare, or
(b) you are visiting the very informative National Museum of Singapore next door, or
(c) you would like a quite place to run or exercise or take a walk in the middle of the Central Business and shopping districts of Singapore, or
(d) you just want to cut across from Dhoby Ghaut to Clarke Quay."
,,Interesting park,4.0,,Well maintained park with interesting trees and historic sites - all well maintained with informative signboards. I particularly enjoyed the historic ones and the archaeological dig site
,,Very interesting,5.0,,I can't believe they don't have more visitors. The number let under the park went untouched for so long apparently and is now interesting for anyone wanting to know about the fall a Singapore in WW2
,,Nice Park,3.0,,Is on a hill so lots of steps and slopes. Like all of Singapore it's well maintained. No playground that we could find just some adult swings. Battle Box is worth doing for some war history.
,,Beautiful Historic park,4.0,,"A beautiful and historic park in the city centre, lovely to visit and explore. The site is hilly and has lots of ramps and steps, but also houses several of the old barracks buildings, fort gates and various little historical gems as you explore."
,,Beautiful Park,5.0,,"Stumbled upon this park by accident and was pleasantly surprised. This park has a great mix of beautiful scenery with historical significance. When we explored it on a Thursday afternoon it was completely empty, perfect for taking some great photos. Worth a visit!

In summary:
Such a nice park. Check it out."
,,Very Nice,5.0,,Lovely place to visit but be prepared to walk and there are loads of steps. Very humid walking through the park make sure you have plenty of fluids with you
,,"Serene, Beautiful & Historic Park",4.0,,"Fort Canning is the hilltop site of previous Singapore Kingdoms, the site for The Battle Box, and also the site of Fort Canning. It is now a lovely hill top park popular with locals and tourists alike.

The original entrance gate still stands and there are many paths to explore.

Well worth a visit!"
,,Scenic and serene,4.0,,"Reminds me of city parks in most developed countries, like Hyde park in London etc. Except smaller, but worth a visit for the sites and snapshot of Singapore's history. Free & right in centre of city."
,,Great walk,5.0,,"Been here every time I come to Singapore as I love the walk - great views, so much history to see and big old trees with many different birds and butterflies to observe. Just right length of time to complete a circuit with a five year old!"
,,Refreshing and beautiful park!,5.0,,"I went to this place for a trip and it was wonderful! It was a beautiful place with great scenery. There was a lighthouse and the flagpole which was necessary in the olden days. The tour guide enlightened us about the history of the place. There were excavation sites and stuff for us to see, and the house in which Raffles and Farquhar lived in in the past. The greenery was beautiful -- there was also a chicken there! There are swings and stuff, and a big, beautiful field where we played games. It is also rather suitable for a wedding photo (there was a couple there)!"
,,Historic Hilltop,3.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a prominent hill in the heart of modern Singapore City. From the earliest times it was considered important and was the home for the early sultans' palaces.

During the British Colonial era a fort was built for the defence of Singapore, but only the fort gateway and remnants of some fort walls remain.

The main attraction there now is the ""Battle Box""' an underground bunker system which was the headquarters of the British Army Command at the outbreak of World War Two. It was here that General Percival and his senior allied officers and staff officers directed the final stages of the Defence of Singapore against the Japanese, and eventually made the decision to surrender."
,,A place where the past meets the present,5.0,,"One of the most beautiful parks in Singapore. If you will be in the city don't miss a chance to take a walk here. It was one of the first place where British landed in 19th century (at that time Fort Canning named as Government hill) and built there a fort with an armory, barracks and hospital.

Nowadays this place look like a peaceful and quiet oasis in the centre of Singapore but it is still fraught with the past and the history of those days. One of my favorite place - memory wall which was a part of old christian cemetery. This is absolutely amazing place which silently keeps a history of the Europeans, who once by chance or by life circumstances lived in Singapore"
,,Great walk,4.0,,"The park is stunning, the information boards that are dotted around make the walk even more enjoyable. A history lesson and a walk all rolled into 1."
,,Green lungs !!,3.0,,"Park overlooks the Clarke Quay and amazing views of Singapore river can be seen. Good Place to relax, unwind or simply sit and enjoy !!"
,,Breathe in the city's clean air,5.0,,"Back in February this year, we stayed at a serviced apartment just across from the park.
Just looking out every morning to Fort Canning was like a big boost to my morning spirit. So green, serene and lush.
Then one day, i decided to climb the stairs. Without a map, i did not get lost for long. The signposts are clearly marked the areas. Besides, what can be bad about getting lost in a lil pretty park, right? Well, the park or (fort) is bigger than i originally thought based on the view from our apartment windows. And it has caves! It's like a big kids lil jungle :)
Saw some local and expats using this park as their outdoor gym, for the stairs, and paved and lush walkways are long and well maintained, as every public facilities in this island/ state. It's a must visit for free things to do when you're in Singapore."
,,walking,3.0,,"The History of the country is here in this area. It is right in the middle of the city, high above everything else. The old historic walls seem to show respect for all they saw. As you climb up the steps you move away from the city sounds and absorb the feeling of what this area once stood for. It is a lot of walking. You do need to plan so you are well prepared of where you enter and where you get out of. It has multiple entries and exists. You can do it at your own pace on multiple days"
,,A park must visit when you are near Clarke Quay,4.0,,"If you are near Clarke Quay and have got some time apart from other attractions, must visit this different park in Singapore."
,,Visit to Fort Channing Bunker,3.0,,"Visited the bunker on holiday recently, guided tour the only option (about 1.5hrs). I felt the script of the tour to be very negative and somewhat factually incorrect. It needs to be re-written to give the correct balanced view. Very much the emphasis was on the British just surrendered and we were left in this situation ..... when in reality the Japanese had cut off all water to Singapore and bodies were rotting in the street! The UK were fighting in the four corners of the world let's not forget, and to stop the loss of anymore civilian life and to be able to bury the dead, was a huge factor in the surrender. Not wishing to give a history lesson, but please give a more balanced view and re-write your script!"
,,Great for an afternoon walk,4.0,,"If you are a WWII buff, this is a great place for an afternoon walk. There are various sites to see, including an archeological dig, the Battle Box underground bunker, an old cannon and various memorials"
,,Battle Box Tour,5.0,,"You have to book a tour of the Battle Box, it is not open for people to wonder round. This is great as the tour was absolutely fascinating. Excellent tour guides and other staff. The command centre has been excellently preserved/recreated. A must for anyone who wants to understand history. which is everyone. And a great tribute to the under resourced garrison..
The park is beautiful and calm."
,,A must see when touring Singapore,4.0,,"Don't leave this one off the list when touring Singapore, a great place to visit and experience some of the history of Singapore. Don't miss Fort Canning. Enjoy."
,,Battle Box tour and Fort Canning Park,4.0,,"We were the only two people on this tour which was led by Sean. It will be of interest to anyone with a knowledge of WW2 history and give a good insight into the reasons for the surrender to the Japanese. We found Sean to be very well presented, courteous and had a good knowledge of his subject. It was nice and cool underground. Would recommend anyone walking to the park have a supply of water with them. Another day we took a walk around the park. A small area was fenced off because of an event taking place but the rest of the park is worth the walk."
,,Heart of the city,4.0,,"Fort canning is easily accessible from many locations. As a park, it is quiet and well-maintained, with many schools using it as a venue for bonding games and activities. There are also other attractions within, such as the Battlebox, but you will need to pay for access. There are a lot of areas to walk around, so its good for relaxation and getting in touch with nature."
,,Nice place for a walk in the city,4.0,,"Singapore lacks green spaces. If you are looking for a park in the city, Fort Canning is the place to go.

It is a hull so there are some slopes but it has some historic markers since it was the centre of governance in the 14th century and also the residence of the British governor.

There is a keramat located there, plus a bunker museum and also a archeological dig site. It is also a site where concerts are held.

Do visit if you like parks but so bring sun screen and water. It is also a great place for a jog."
,,Battle Box,4.0,,A very informative tour detailing why the allies had no choice but to surrender Singapore to the Japanese (despite Churchill's orders to fight to the death).
,,Film @ Fort Canning,4.0,,Beautiful place to watch a film under the stars. Please go to Film @ Fort Canning to buy your tickets! Well worth it!
,,Green oasis in the city,4.0,,A lovely park but best visited early as it was very hot in the afternoon. I found it peaceful to be surrounded by mature trees in the heart of the city. Close to the National Museum and an art gallery which was closed on the day I visited.
,,"A Hill full of History, Heritage and Stories",5.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a historic place not to be missed and it showed stories from the 14th Century right up to the independence of Singapore in the 60's. From the Cannons to the Fort Wall to the Quartermaster's Rest area and not to mention Battle Box, this place will bring you through what Singapore has gone through for the last 600 years. Do not miss out on the Fort Canning Lighthouse as well. Definitely a place for the History Buffs."
,,Very relaxing park in central Singapore,4.0,,"Right across from Clarke Quay busy area, Fort Canning Park is a relaxing oasis of green lush vegetation. It is quite a walk up the stairs, but you can take the mechanic stairs situated on the side of the National Museum. The park is great for a walk and has a few historic landmarks. It also hosts regular cultural activities like Shakespeare in the Park. It's a very nice park to enjoy for jogging as well. It is close to the national museum on one side, to Clarke quay on the other side, to the historic fire station as well and Dhoby Gaut and Orchard on the other side."
,,"Peaceful, beautifully green oasis on top of the hill. Great vantage point to see Orchard Road.",4.0,,"The fort is open for tours however we just missed the tour of the underground bunker. Rather than wait for the next one we took a leisurely walk around by ourselves. Appreciated the old gates and walls of the historical fort. Also appreciated some beautiful old trees with tree roots reaching down to the ground like in the mangroves. It was peaceful and quiet except for the sounds of birds and cicadas, and easy to just lose oneself in the greenery and forget that we were surrounded by the city."
,,Battle Box,5.0,,"If you need to remove yourself from the crowds, then a leisurely stroll around Fort Canning is a must. Open space, lush green gardens, with plenty of history to read about along the way.
The newly reopened Battle Box, in which the allies used as the control centre, in the lead up to the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942, is a must for history buffs. This vast under ground bunker, has been recreated to resemble the final moments of the invasion. Complete with wax manikins of the military personnel.
This tour is guided only, and is very informative."
,,Worth a long walk through,5.0,,This hill is worth the effort it takes to walk up. There are stairs and paths which have lovely sculptures and information signs all the way along. The fort is interesting with easy access. The street level is just as lovely and full of interesting plants and a lovely cafe area.
,,Nature in the heart of the city,5.0,,"Let's get away the boring must do stuff for this trip... bring bug spray AND spray liberally!!! Those mozzies are commando trained! Bing wet wipes or towels to wipe/wash off bug spray and sweat after your walk in the park. Bring water. It gets really hot after a short time. Bring a change of clothing. Bun up your hair. Bring a cap. Apply sunscreen. You can afford not to bring anything... BUT BRING THE BUG SPRAY!!! I would recommend those with deet in them! In the event you do get bitten (whether at Fort Canning or anywhere else), buy ""Mopiko"" Cream. After bathing. Apply to the bitten lumps and heat the itch away with a hairdryer blowing on the itchy patches.

Let's get down to the real thing now... The flowers and the trees are absolutely beautiful and lovely! The scenery is wonderful as well. They have tours towards the last 2 weeks of each month and lots of activities too. Check out the website for more information - https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/fort-canning-park. If you do go for one of the guided tours (which are by volunteers), you HAVE to select Yap Tat Ming - absolute delight! His stories and knowledge about the history of Fort Canning and the plants will amaze you and leave you wanting more. A definite MUST go."
,,Great escape,4.0,,If you are in the area it provides a nice escape from the business around. Beautifully kept all around with the museum and garden to get aqcuainted with local history and greenery.
,,"Great for the history Buff, or interested tourist",4.0,,"A lovely walk around the hill if you don't want to go inside the bunker. But for history buffs or the inquisitive tourist, a visit and tour of the army bunker is a must."
,,A nice walk,4.0,,"A small park, very central and easy to find. It is a nice place to take a relaxing walk in the middle of the burst."
,,Nice Historical Park,4.0,,"Nice walking through the old historical park, many parks like this are in Singapore really nice to escape from the busy city live."
,,Steeped in WW11 history,4.0,,"If you have read up on the surrender and occupation by the Japanese forces in Singapore during WW11 the a visit to the battle box within Fort Canning Park is a must, the area whilst very hilly is home to some fantastic trees and vegetation, the trails are well sign posted and the trees are mostly identified by their type making it a pleasant and interesting walk"
,,"Nice for a short run, nice views on the colonial pat of Singapore",4.0,,Fort Canning Park is easily accessible from Dhoby Ghaut SMRT Station and offers views on the colonial part of Singapore. It is great for a short run.
,,Every time you turn a surprise,5.0,,"Quite simply, it is the history of Singapore in one place. Every time I turned a corner I found something new -- a sculpture, a historical marker, a wonderful view. My favorite view in SIN is from the raffles house, looking towards the old Supreme Court, with the Marina Bay Towers in the distance."
,,Stunning views,5.0,,"A strenuous walk up to the top but so worth it, beautiful greenery all around the park, very shady. Most of 'rest benches' along the way"
,,Good green-lush walk with some bonuses,4.0,,"If you are staying on and around Orchard Rd and thinking of spending an hour or two for a morning walk plus, do consider a route via Fort Canning Park.
A bit hilly with lush greens and nice breeze.

It has several scenic spots to drop by: the spice garden, the picnic terrace, the raffles terrace, the gothic gate, etc.

You might want to finish off in the The Fabulous Baker Boy at the other side of the hill for a coffee and some sweets/ cakes. Or you can go across the River Valley Rd to Clark Quay/ Liang Court area for even more food/ drink choices."
,,Nice mix of history and art surrounded by greenery,5.0,,"Had a quick walk around the park during a break in a conference I attended at Hotel Fort Canning. Realised I needed more time to explore this brilliant park that has arts, history and also an educational walk through a herb garden. Definitely coming back here."
,,Beautiful and Informative,4.0,,"We visited this park as we could see it from our hotel room and it looked beautiful.

This park is well maintained, beautiful and green. There are history information boards along the pathway giving you information about the discovery of Singapore, the grounds and buildings etc

It would be a good place for a picnic, unwinding and for those wanting to find out a little about the history of Singapore. Good place/space to bring younger children if they need timeout from a hotel room or shopping mall.

Tip: wear mosquito repellent"
,,Walk at the park,5.0,,"We were staying nearby and decided to have a walk here. The map looked big but the actual place is relatively small. They have big trees and green surroundings, felt like not in Singapore for a short time."
,,History and beauty - Battle Box tour,5.0,,"We went here last week and really enjoyed a guided tour of the Battle Box which is an underground bunker used by the Brits during the Second World War during the fall of Singapore.

If you love a little military history this is well worth a visit. fort Canning is still worth a visit as there is 700 yrs of History there."
,,Nice park.,4.0,,It provides interesting history of Singapore. I walked around here in the morning. Peaceful place near Clarke Quay. Good views of the city and nice place to chill. Nothing much to see other than lots of nice greenery and the city views.
,,Clean green space in downtown,4.0,,"A very beautiful quiet place in the heart of the city. Like any other park in Singapore,Fort Canning Park, is the place for strolling jogging and cycling around with fresh air. It used to be a fortress and bunker in World War II. It's convenient located in Southeast of Singapore. The highlights include underground crossing to the park is covered with shady of many trees."
,,Nice Cooling Spot with a hilltop view of Singapore,4.0,,"If you're tired of doing a walking tour of downtown Singapore, Fort Canning is the perfect place to rest a bit, one, it is FREE! The spice garden is educational, it is a wonderful introduction to the straits spices with a hint of history too. Moving up, at Raffles House, you can have a different perspective of Marina Bay and the rest of downtown Singapore. The ubiquitous park benches are very welcoming if you want to pause for a while and take in the air of Singapore! One downside though, I noticed, unlike in the Singapore Botanical Gardens, here at Fort Canning there are not many water fountains, so make sure to bring water before coming here. Fort Canning is just right next to the Singapore Philately Museum and the National Museum of Singapore."
,,Quite a Climb,4.0,,"The Park is effectively a hill, but a great place for a walk. The tour of the war tunnels is definitley worth doing, to understand the hitor of the fall of Singapore"
,,British history,4.0,,Leisurely way to breathe in history and imagine how it may have happened when the first Europeans arrived.
,,nice park close to the city,4.0,,Walked around here on a Sunday morning. Nice peaceful place just behind Clarke Quay. Good views of the city and nice place to chill. Nothing much to see other than lots of nice greenery and the city views.
,,Provides an interesting history of Singapore,4.0,,"Located essentially across the road from Clarke Quay climbing up Fort Canning (which is not too difficult) is worth the effort. Aside from the nice views to be had you will learn some of the history of Singapore, especially from a maritime perspective. The park is very green and lunch."
,,Oasis,5.0,,"Beautiful park in the middle of the city. Felt like a million miles away. Beautiful trails, trees, plants. Highly enjoyed."
,,The Battle Box tour is worthwhile,4.0,,"We have visited Singapore many times but this the first time we have a few hours at Fort Canning hill. Great views over the city, lots of historical locations and delightful shady walks. One highlight was the Battle Box tour which recounts the tale of the surrender to Japanese forces in WW2. Good guide and interesting set up in the bowels of the hill, as a bonus it is quite cool."
,,quiet place,5.0,,"Relaxing and a quiet park on a hill, you need good walking shoes for this place, cool and shady, very part of a very robust and hectic city"
,,a piece of history and a green retreat from the city,4.0,,"We walked through fort canning on our first morning in Singapore. We started near Clarke quay and enjoyed watching the bird life. We followed the markers and information signs to different aspects of the park. Very peaceful, at that time of the morning. Locals using the park for different activities, we walked by a yoga class, wedding preparations, joggers, young families playing and people walking dogs. We found the gates at the top, and the archaeological dig, yet didn't know a full history until we took the battle box tour. Great spot to connect with the city, the view is worth a few moments and a few photos."
,,Beautiful View of the City and River,1.0,,"Definitely a beautiful view from the top, worth the walk up all the stairs. Lovely at nght, although the information signs do not have any lighting so can't be rad."
,,Wlked her from Clarks Quay,4.0,,"Some steep climbing but lovely park with various terraces name d after famous people such as Raffles, who had a house there. Herb garden , various different plantings, large green sloping area, seating. Lovely museum and interesting small grave yard."
,,Calm in the centre of Singapore,4.0,,"An afternoon spent wandering the paths, sampling the aroma of the herb garden and and generally enjoying the plant and bird life. Ample information signs mean a self guided tour is possible and glean the story as you go. You can follow it up with a guided tour of the Battle Box."
,,Lovely getaway in the city centre,5.0,,"Love this park! It's small, you can walk the outside lap in less than an hour but there are a few inner trails including one that leads to Raffles House which is lovely. The entrance at the back of Funan mall has a tall staircase that is a good workout for the legs! If you are lucky you will see some wildlife."
,,Park in the center city,4.0,,"a lot of big trees, more than 100 years with natural around. It was a history place in World War II park. I had a good walk and enjoy to take pictures here."
,,Nice historic sight,4.0,,"The park is very well kept. Beautiful vegetation. Very clean.
We arrived and luckily were just in time for a guided tour of the bunker from WW2. The tour was very interesting, teaching a chapter in Singapore history. Do not miss the tour. Tour is not expensive and worth the money ."
,,Elevated oasis in the centre of Singapore,4.0,,"Came here ostensibly to visit the Battle Box but walked around while we waited for tours to commence.
There is certainly plenty to see and do from top to bottom. As another reviewer commented - there were butterflies everywhere.
A diverse selection of attractions - asian spice garden, archaeological dig, tomb etc etc
The gardens are certainly well maintained and the history boards are informative."
,,green and peaceful place in the city centre with an introduction to Singapore's history,5.0,,"nice place to get introduced to Singapore's history. green space in the very heart of the city, used to be a 'forbidden hill', home to Malay kings who ruled the island. nice retreat from the hot streets below the hill, a place for a slow walk or snack with a view. check out, the place holds regular exhibitions and/or concerts"
,,Saw lots of butterflies and was a beautiful walk,4.0,,"On a Saturday morning we walking Fort Canning Park for almost two hours to get a bit of exercise, read more history of Singapore, and take a scenic way to get from our hotel to Clark Quay for lunch. We are glad we did.

If one takes the time to read about the headstones on the wall, all of the signs in the park, and to view of all of the artifacts, one gets a better understanding of the history of this country. Sections of the park are divided into centuries with information about that time period. It's a fascinating walk through history.

Benches are stationed around Fort Canning if you need a break from walking or to relax in a bit of shade. We saw dozens of butterflies in this park and one bi-colored lizard."
,,Park,4.0,,This a small but a pretty old park here.A very good place to hangout with family and friends.A very good park for kids they love this.
,,Peaceful,4.0,,Walking around Fort Canning makes me wonder how this place can be so peaceful despite being in the heart of the city. There are some really huge old trees that tower over you and some amazing birds that chatter and chirrup all day long that makes this place really relaxing. You could sit back and relax while taking a view of the bustling city.
,,Great views of Sea and City,4.0,,I've been here dozens of times over the years. From the 80s when it was nothing but a hill with a few dirt trails to the nicely developed and yet low key vista that it is now. I often take a hike up here during my morning walks in Singapore. Lovely views of the city and the sea. Quiet and relaxing as well.
,,Rather grand and colonial,4.0,,This lovely green oasis is rather grand and colonial and is worth a visit to find out about colonial and WW2 historic events.
,,Lots things to see.,4.0,,This is a beautiful park once again beautifully maintained. Allow a fair bit of time to walk around as lots to look at and see.
,,A solace away from the hustle and bustle!,4.0,,"The Fort Canning Park offers visitors a solace away from the hustle and bustle of the city at the foot of the Fort Canning hill.

A leisure hike to the submit offers interesting sights and sounds such as the Hotel Fort Canning, a Spice Garden, the Registry of Marriages and not forgetting the lush undergrowth peppered with numerous species of plants and flowers.

Some interesting things to look out for includes but is not limited to:
‚Ä¢ The timeball
‚Ä¢ A glimpse of the reservoir atop the hill
‚Ä¢ A tomb believed to belong to one of the first kings of the then Singapura
‚Ä¢ The Battlebox - a tourist attraction which showcases an exquisitely architectures underground work quarter where the decision to surrender to the formidable opposing force was arrived at by Singapore's colonial guardians
‚Ä¢ A plain perfect for picnics
and many more!

The perfect place to get in touch with nature. But don't forget your insect repellents and water for hydration as you embark on the hike into nature! ;D"
,,Not worth a visit,3.0,,"We started our visit to Colonial District from this park following advice in Lonely Planet guide, but we're disappointed. From metro station we had to climb up the hill to enter the park and then to walk down. Not worth a visit."
,,Well worth the climb!,5.0,,"My wife and I climbed up to the park via the steps next to the main fire station on a very hot and sultry day in the city and it was literally a breath of fresh air to find oneself in the tranquility of the Fort Canning Park.Squirrels,birds of many sizes and colours,rats (nice ones),lizards and a mother pheasant and her chick got on with their daily routines as we sat quietly watching.I did some sketches of the lighthouse!!Some good views out over the city through the gaps in the trees.There are some huge and beautiful trees in this park.Well worth the effort."
,,Oasis in the middle of the city,4.0,,"Nice and relaxful place in the heart of the city. From Clarke Quay you can go up and be in the green. Old trees...big , with hudge crowns offering a lot of shade at noon. Couple of old houses including the Raffels one. Couple of canons, old fort walls, Museum (Pinacotheque de Paris)"
,,Nice park,4.0,,This is a beautiful park. It is not very big. I walked through it to go to the National Museum. A nice change from the shopping malls.
,,Beware that this park is full of mosquito,5.0,,"Nice and peaceful park in the city, it's a treasure in the city that you can find many thing to see, the battlebox, the art gallery, the fort canning green, Gothic gate,cannon, ligt house ( YES, there is a light house there!! ) and a Sultan/King Iskandar Syah's grave."
,,Lots of stairs but still a nice location,5.0,,We walked through this park and it was nice to visit. Had to walk up lots of stairs to get to the top.
,,Garden full of suprises,5.0,,Fort Canning Park is well worth a visit. It has a small archaeological site and its own spice gardens.
,,Good escape into nature in the middle of CBD,4.0,,Good natural work out option in the hustle and bustle of the city.. It is hilly and has quite a few steps but is a beautiful place which nature lovers will enjoy.. Hosts plays and shows from time to time so might be worth checking out if they are hosting anything when you plan to visit
,,Hillier than expected,3.0,,"We entered the Park from the Dhoby Ghaut MRT end. There is a shortcut via Park Mall (lift to level 4 and out through the car park) that cuts out the steep stairs. We diverted to the Singapore National Museum (for a visit to the Singapore History Gallery) and then planned to return to the Park using the escalator only to find the up one was not working - so stairs to climb. The Park was hillier than we realised and found it difficult to get to the heart of it. We always seemed to be on the outskirts. Poor signage? Nevertheless, what we saw we liked. We exited at the other end onto Hill Street. The stairs down were long and steep so unless you are energetic the Dhoby Ghaut end provides easier access."
,,Beautiful Gardens very well maintained,5.0,,"Spent the best part of a day walking the park - very well laid out, good views of the city and very interesting to read the history of the fort and see the fort gate (dates from the late C19th). Only disappointment was that there were many school tours and we didn't manage to see the Battle Box (an underground bunker system used in WW2) as the guide advised us it would be too crowded and noisy (school trip). We didn't have the time to come back later or on another day. Nevermind this will be on our itinerary for our next trip to Singapore all being well."
,,Lovely peaceful retreat from the city,5.0,,Hard to believe this is a stone throw from bustling orchard road. Great to walk around. The archeological excavations are particularly interesting and if you are here during Shakespeare in the park it's worth getting a ticket
,,Definitely worth a visit,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is well set out and combines the history of old Singapore,with the recent war years. It is possibly not suitable for people who have difficulty walking too far or cannot climb steps however. When I last visited ,the bunkers were open to the public and we did a tour. This is where the disastrous defence of Singapore was run from, by General PercivalO(not his fault!) and his officers,plus some 300 personnel. There are also various trails one can follow with a plentiful number of sign boards,setting out various key historical events in the early days of Singapore. It is also well worhwhile poring over the grave headstones in the gardens,which are set into the wall. They give one a fascinating incite into the old colonials who lived here,their range of nationalities,their longevity(which in many cases was short) and an incite into how they died.."
,,I like this place,4.0,,"This is a place where you can almost get away. It is small but well laid out. Great for running, exercising, romantic walks etc. For fitness buffs there is even a fitness station, but be warned it is hot work in this area as is sheltered from the much needed breeze."
,,"Visit for the history, stay for the views",3.0,,"If you're feeling mildly athletic, this historic landmark is definitely worth a meandering visit, and is a great escape from the nearby bustling Clarke Quay and Orchard Road. The landscaping is beautiful, there's a museum (check opening times in advance) and some fantastic ruins with informational signs - the views are great too.

A handy hint: avoid visiting in the middle of the day (or wear a hat), and take a bottle of water - it gets very hot and humid!"
,,Good Place,5.0,,"This is a good place next to Clarke Quay. It is a nice destination for a short trek. The place has a huge lawn and is good for jogging and running. The terrain here is full of high's and low's. At some places, you get very tired while hiking.
Good for workout during mornings and evenings."
,,Slog uphill to Battle Box,4.0,,"In the heat of the day you slog up the hill only to find that there is a 40 minute wait for the next tour guide. If like us you have your 7 year old grandson with you then 40 minutes waiting time is not an option. So the moral of the story is to always check out tour times before you go. Nice helpful staff in the visitor's center where you can buy a gift, sweets, drinks or ice cream while you wait, when you have finished they will even call a cab for you."
,,Glad we checked it out,4.0,,"Went for a morning stroll at 5:30am. A couple of stairs to climb here and there but pretty much anyone can do it, if they pace themselves. The park itself wraps around a huge mountain that surrounds Fort Canning. Even before sunrise there were people exercising, so we felt safe. Worth a look if your staying around this area."
,,Well worth the climb up the steps,4.0,,Not having read about Fort Canning park we came across it by accident. But a climb up the steps with stops to admire the view on the way was worthwhile. It was much cooler amongst the trees than at ground level.
,,Looks Like a small park on the Hill but its HUGE,4.0,,"The Fort Canning Park was directly across the road from our Hotel and we had 2 hours to kill before we went to the airport so decided to go and have a look.So glad we did.It was really beautiful and tranquil.Filled with sculptures,Exotic gardens and lots of history.Lots of joggers running through there.Beautiful spot and worth the visit.The stairs are easy to climb and there are not that many of them."
,,The Battle Box - An insightful journey,4.0,,"Had the privilege of a first hand guided tour of the Battle Box at Fort Canning Park before its official opening, and an honour having its director Mr. Jeya Ayadurai as our guide.
The underground bunker had been restored with major structures at its original state, down to the crystallised minerals formed on the walls. With the addition of modern day a/c and de-humidifiers, the conditions was great for a historical journey through the turbulent 1940s. The guide gave an unforgettable account of what happened during the last days before Singapore fell to the Japanese during WWII and you cannot help but to be astounded by the way he presented and unfolds the events that lead to 12 men deciding the fate of this sunny island.
Singaporeans especially the younger generation must have a go at this place and appreciate what our forefathers had gone through to build up what we have today."
,,"Out of the way, a surprising historical park",5.0,,A bit of old Singapore high on the hill above the city. Interesting buildings and relics within a large park. Look especially for the gravestones of English colonials who often did not last more than a few months before succumbing to tropical diseases.
,,A quite oasis with a dash of history,4.0,,"A lovely green oasis to escape the hub Bub of Singapore, leafy paths and spice gardens to wander around, or shady trees to sit under in the heat of the day.
In the middle is the battle box, the underground bunker that the defence of Singapore was commanded from. Now restored there are guided tours through the bunker that allow you to relive the desperate days of 1942 (around $30 with tours running about 4 times a day)"
,,Interesting local history,4.0,,Enjoyed a pleasant stroll round here. There are quite a lot of steps! There is a spice garden and plenty of shady areas to sit and relax. Some magnificent trees too. We didn't look round the battery this time as had seen it before but worth looking at.
,,A beautiful peace of nature in the city center.,5.0,,"Have been enjoying Fort Canning Park for some lunchtime breaks. The park is very green and offers a lot of shade in most areas.

Perfect if you want to exercise as it has lots and lots of stairs.

But also just as perfect if you want to just relax for a moment. It's usually quiet with not too many other visitors.

The signs around the walkways talk you through the history of the Fort/Singapore."
,,Great spot of history,4.0,,"Super place to visit at the top of the hill in Singapore. Hot day and hard walk but great views and a quiet area. Such a large area that people can be absorbed.
Only came across on toilet and a small cafe near the main entrance but that was part of its charm. There is a hotel in the grounds.
Grounds are well used by local groups and the centre is fenced off with high security fencing etc.
Great picnic area or place to visit and read the information boards placed around the site.
Notable for old guns/ Sally port and fortifications."
,,Nice Climb up Fort Canning,3.0,,"Fort Canning is located at prime shopping area of Singapore. I've been there a few times, and some marathon take this route as this is very challenging to climb up and down Fort Canning Park.

At night, this place is very beautiful and romantic for couple as it is a nice park to chill at and do prepare mosquito repellent if you are there at night."
,,The battle box,5.0,,Do visit this lovely park. With herb gardens and unusual flowers & trees. Then visit the underground Battle box. The place where the English were dug in when they had to surrender to the Japanese. All kept the same with working models to show the horrendous situation they had when there water was disconnected.
,,A hidden tourist gem,4.0,,A very well kept park for both history and exercise. Lots of history with regard to the old fort and its gate structure. The under ground battle box and cannons and lots of old Singapore history. Informative plaques everywhere. Great running tracks and lots of stairs for cardio.
,,A Beautiful Park in the Middle of a City,5.0,,"Each year when we holiday in Singapore we always make a point of walking through the park several times during our stay. Gives good lookout points for parts of Singapore, lovely birds and wildlife can be spotted. It's a beautiful park and has made different walkways that lead out onto different parts of the city."
,,"Hard climbs, and you get bitten to death",3.0,,"We decided to walk around Fort Canning, mainly because of the military historic perspective. Well when we got there this element was closed for refurbishment. Undeterred we carried on. Big mistake, it is one heck of a climb, normally not a problem, but in 90% humidity and about 90f it is a challenge. I got bitten to death, so much so that a few days later I had to seek medical advice and treatment. There are public toilets but not much else. All in all go to the Botanic Gardens they are much easier to navigate and have better facilities."
,,I love this place,4.0,,"This park is very nice for quiet walk and picnics. I love the scenery and the country feel. Very nice for a good walk, i sometimes come in this place when i wanted to just be alone and read and relax."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,not as good as Gardens by the bay - but still awesome - take good walking shoes and the main building has a Spanish style restaurant and art exhibitions.
,,Pleasant,4.0,,"Stumbled across this park on a walkabout and enjoyed an hour or so strolling around. On a planned visit I would use mosquito repellent as I was bitten quite badly. Interesting plants,trees and spice garden."
,,Tranquility,5.0,,This rather large park is hilly with plenty of walkways and greenery It has history and is an oasis in this bustling city
,,Look out for performances and concerts,4.0,,"Located at the heart of the town area, a short walk from Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, this is a good place to visit for a walk or a run. There are performaces held here too, you can get your tickets from sistic."
,,Get your exercise,4.0,,Well positioned park. Central to city. Lots of self explanatory signs to help you understand the history. Great walking.
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Due to the wet weather, not so conducive but the place was wonderful. Rich in history. Nice view, overall great experience"
,,Great place to wander,4.0,,"On a Sunday parking was free. Pathways were really good it was lightly raining but they weren't slippery. Lots of shade. There were steps on done paths but always a ramp option close by. A great snapshot of the history of the hill, archaeological dig, time ball, lighthouse and cemetery. Would recommend."
,,"Beautiful, Peaceful walking area",5.0,,"The park is at the top of a hill, and has at least 160 steps to the top from the Hill Street side. Once you navigate that, you have a pleasant walk around a large covered reservoir at the top, with several historical artifacts and sites. There may be less strenuous way up there, perhaps from the Fort Canning Hotel, but I enjoyed the exercise of the climb. There are great views of the river and other areas of Singapore and many signs describing the sights. There are also many trees and plants that are labeled for the botany inclined tourist."
,,Beautiful and historical,5.0,,I really loved wondering around the park. There are a variety of different tracks you can follow which have signs along the way with interesting historical facts as well as old buildings and features such as canons and a lighthouse.
,,A beautiful well kept park,5.0,,"We spent a morning wandering through this park as there is so much to see, and there is lots of wild birds to photograph. There is a well stocked Spice garden with some plants we have never seen before."
,,Raffles house,4.0,,"Am a volunteer at the fort canning park and love it as such. The other day we had a seminar in the Raffles house. So nice and old. Re: the approach to the Fort canning park, if you are not comfortable with steps, then the most convenient approach is from the Registry of marriages, rest of the approaches are almost each about a climb of 200 steps to get into the main park"
,,Place to Enjoyed the walk on Saturday,5.0,,"We took mrt to Dhobyghaut and exit A. After crossing the road just saw the sign for Park. Very easy to find.

We saw a few tiny chickens and squirrels around the park. A lot of big trees here. In the park have small place to sit in for picnic or resting and also a few bench along the walk way.

There was NoNe public toilet or water tap around the park. Better to do your business and grab some bottle of drinking water from 7-11 inside MRT."
,,"Take The Time, It's Worth It",5.0,,"Right in the middle of the city is one of Singapore's hidden gems. This park is not only beautifully maintained and accessible to everyone, it also has some of the islands most interesting history points and world heritage sites. You will be surprised!"
,,Where are the toilets?,4.0,,"Followed the public toilet signs but they were locked to concert goers. Female staff at the museum wouldn't let concert goers use their toilets either (very unpleasant woman) so anyone lining up had to walk 10 minutes away to Park Mall for the loo. I thought Singapore is a developed country but event organizers or venues don't even supply this basic necessity. Only toilets supplied by the organizers were in the arena and not open to public till we entered 4 hours later (depends how long you've been lining up)!

Fort Canning Park is otherwise a really nice location for gigs, cool and refreshing and it's a pity my experience was marred by this."
,,Big forest-like park,3.0,,"This park is very big, energy consuming for sure if you explore the whole park.
It is quite nice, park in the middle of the town.
It is like a city forest, sometimes people use this place for photography spot or prewed photo shoot. Inside the park there is marriage registry office."
,,A lovely walk in the park,4.0,,"Centrally located near to Clark's Quay this is a lovely place to spend a couple of hours strolling around, and its free. Various things of interest to see as you wander around."
,,Tranquil amidst chaos,3.0,,"Romantic place to visit, brings back memories from childhood. Tranquil place amidst the bustling city. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Tranquil and beautiful,4.0,,"We walked the entirety of the park and particularly loved the trees with hanging branches , very different to back in the UK . It is well cared for and is a little oasis in the middle of the city. For those who are not able bodied be aware that some of the routes have lots of steps but there is always some sort of alternative."
,,Nice walk,3.0,,Quiet oasis in the midst of a busy metropolis. Relatively cool due to the abundance of trees. The National Museum of Singapore is close by.
,,Various opprtunities,4.0,,"Beautiful park, when in season you can enjoy opera and ballet - keep updated with what is going ob or just enjoy this historic park"
,,Well worth a morning here,5.0,,"I went in my own as my boyfriend was off at tyhge grandprix track.I wasljed to the park asns astound. It has great wheelchair access. The park was a delight to walk around. There is parking and a visitor centre.
The different gardens were wonderful to walk through. And seeing the history of the place was so insightful. The weather did change whilst I was there and the break was in temperature was much needed. The sculpture and spice gardern was my favourite.
The bunker was under refurbishment while I was there but opened again in autumn. When I go next year I will definitely be re visiting"
,,Beautiful Park,5.0,,"We walked through Fort Canning Park on a rainy afternoon, which may explain why there was no-one else there! Neat pathways, well-maintained gardens and beautifully set out. This is a real haven right in the middle of Singapore."
,,"Nice, large City Park across from Clarke Quay",4.0,,"Sitting on the grounds of the former Fort Canning, and prior ancient temples, this a great spot to go for a stroll or run. It's accessible via metro, bus and/or walking. It's a fairly large park and you can enter from many different areas, and it gets popular on weekends. There's history to be seen here with the old fort walls/bastions/cannons, and some houses/structures. There's also an art museum near the top of the hill you can tour. A few cafes are located on the grounds (one inside the art museum, and some along the outskirts). There's also a hotel on the grounds. Lots of green here, very pleasant for walking. Strollers and wheelchairs can also be used. It's great for a jog and there are some pull-up bars, balance beams, etc. along the path for further exercise. The national museum can be accessed after coming out of the Northeast side of the park.

For a tour, word is it's a stop on the World War II tour out of the Changi Museum."
,,A pleasant place to sit and think,5.0,,"This is a very nice quiet park , to just walk, jog, sit, or make pictures while staying in the city. It is one of the best places to visit in Singapore if you like to be in a quiet outdoor park. It is safe, clean, and peaceful; and all free of charge entrance.
One of it's entrance is just across Funan digital mall so you can go and sit with a nice book if you are not keen in coming along into the 'man's mall' when in Singapore :-)."
,,Walking back in time with Sultans and Great Explorers,4.0,,"I have been here many times for events and dropping guests on their many excursions but never spent much time on my own. An afternoon wander along the footpaths and fort walls reading commemorative plates and the names on headstones of earlier settlers gave me a good understanding how Singapore's entrep√¥t reputation was sealed over a century ago.
I found Armenian, Arabian, British, Dutch, German, Russian, Portugese and variety of other names on these headstones and the few forgotten graves on the far end of Fort Canning Green towards the bottom of the hill.
Many artifacts in museums here from the Asian Civilizations to the Peranakan, Malay and Indian Cultural museums were dug up right here from these grounds!
Not forgetting the grand mosoluems of regents and the Malayan royal court, found in the farther end of the field.
It really must have been a magical time of great explorers coming from far flung lands and of traders and adventure seekers making their mark in Singapore. Must come back when the Battle Box is open again."
,,A plesant city park,4.0,,We cut through here from Orchard Road to Clarkes Quay and found it to be a really pleasant a quite park in the middle of the city. Nice place to spend a bit of time
,,Interesting quiet park,5.0,,"We were staying in the Novotel so just walked over the road to explore this park and really enjoyed it there was a lot going on on a Sunday morning. Graduates were floating about in gowns having there photos taken, there was a model doing a photo shoot in rediculously high heels and a gold minidress and men were fencing with long poles with knives on the end. In addition there were signs telling you what the trees were and an interesting history trail with information on the history of Singapore. There is also a big art gallery although we did not visit that. Well worth a visit , often overlooked, an oasis of trees right in the middle of Singapore."
,,Heritage - a sensory experience.,5.0,,"The hill once known as Forbidden Hill for its defence structures and colonial Government House today is home to a hotel, and the Singapore branch of the Pinacotheque art museum.

Visitors are welcome to explore on their own the centuries-old Malay heritage trail, with the supposed tomb ""Keramat"" of the last Sultan of the Melakan Empire.

Two British-era cannon still exist.

Guided tours by the National Parks Board are available on weekend mornings and late afternoons, subject to group numbers and the weather.

Nature lovrrs will appreciate the scents emanating from its Spice Garden.

It is also a favourite spot for wedding photo shoots, in particular at the ""Gothic"" and Fort gates.

There are entry points by foot next to the National Museum, and along Hill Street. Parking is also available, so is public transport."
,,Cool and inviting,4.0,,If you need a rest from the bustle of Singapore this is the place to visit. A walk round the greenery and trees is very restful. Take a picnic and spend time exploring the statues and monuments. Of course you can always use the paths for running and jogging if that is your preference. A busy place on Sunday with crowds of migrant workers having their day off and congregating there. The length of stay would depend on what you wanted to do there. Could be half an hour to 3 or more hours.
,,New attractions for the Francophiles,3.0,,Fort Canning is a bit difficult to go to without a car but the visit can be rewarding if you're into arts and all-things French. The Pinacotheque that recently opened is the main attraction of this area. It's worth visiting if you're interested in the ongoing exhibit.
,,Great for walking / running - close to Clarke Quay,4.0,,Great option for walking around or going for a run when in town. Close to the River and just above Clarke Quay.
,,An oasis of calm,4.0,,We enjoyed a pleasant morning exploring the charms of Canning Park. Although close to City Hall the park is a quiet and relaxing place. As you walk around the park there are numerous markers explaining the various historical sites within the park.
,,AMAZING,5.0,,I was in vacations with my family in the hotel near this park. We just walked and hung out ! It was a magic moment and I advice you to go there !
,,Most amazing gem in the middle of a bustling city,5.0,,"I am staying at Novotel Clarke Quay, right opposite to Fort Canning Park, a most amazing gem in the middle of a bustling city. I was up before sunrise and couldn't sleep afterwards, hence decided to check the place out. The park has access from Clarke quay through a pedestrian bridge. I had never anticipated what I was about to see. Steep hill upwards, followed by great treks. You have lots of signs telling you about the history of Singapore and believe me, at every sign you end up stopping and reading it.

Such a quiet and serene place in the middle of this city, I had never imagined. The park is free (place where I come from, we pay entry fees to public parks). It's a very peaceful place and for sure a suitable location for a jog, walk or a picnic.

Must visit"
,,"Fort Canning includes ""The Battle Box"" a marvellous mini-museum for historians",5.0,,"Especially for military historians. The park itself is a delightful morning walk featuring typical Singaporean tropical foliage. However it is much more than that as it includes remnants of the British military base with some wonderful old buildings. Particularly impressive is the ""Battle Box"" which was an underground bunker used by the British high command during the Japanese invasion in World War II. There is a realistic reenactment of the fateful decision to surrender all Allied forces to the Japanese by General Percival during a general staff meeting. Very insightful."
,,Great dining and lounging,5.0,,This area of Singapore is off the beaten path and contains several restaurants and pubs. This used to me a military compound that was turned into restaurants and pubs and has great dining and drinking. Best to see in the evening when the activity picks up.
,,Hills and stairs,3.0,,"Climbed up all the hills and stairs. Saw a lighthouse and a few canons. A bit of a view but not much. Don't go here during the heat of the day, you will be disappointed."
,,The old historic Fort Canning Park,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is the oldest park in Singapore. You can find lots of cannon ball trees and nutmeg trees here. There is an old cemetery near the front gates and the cemetery is being preserved whilst other cemeteries like Bidadari has been demolished for housing development.
Fort Canning Park is frequented by courting couples in their 20s and at night many couples come here to renew their vows.
At times foreign bands give a public performance on a makeshift stage put up for the purpose.
There is an old kramat where a Muslim saint was once buried. You can see some old cannons used by the British when they were in Singapore during the colonial days."
,,Beautiful and Peaceful,4.0,,It is a challenging walk in parts but there is some real beauty here. The park has some really ancient trees and the views of Clarke Quay and Singapore River and worth the walking effort
,,Beautiful and Peaceful,4.0,,"The park is a nice change from the hustle and bustle of Singapore city, and you would never guess it was right in the centre of it all. It's nice to walk through and lounge under the trees for a bit of shade from the humidity. I would definitely recommend strolling through if you have the time."
,,Historic,5.0,,"Anyone with an interest in the military side of Singapore's history has to visit Fort Canning Park. The actual room where it was decided that Singapore would be surrendered in February 1942 is spine - chilling. I think you are only allowed in with an official tour, but I believe that's the best wayt o go anyway."
,,"Peacefull, Tranquility...",4.0,,"Stumbled across this place by accident. Great place to visit, walking around the gardens and taking in some of the history."
,,Singaporean History In The Park,4.0,,"A very good park in the city, lots of historic plaques abound telling the story of the settlement of Singapore, many hundreds of years ago, well before the arrival of Raffles. Also the old cemetery and buildings from the colonial days all tell stories, a interesting place to visit to get the history of the peninsula. Definitely worth a visit."
,,A quiet escape from the city,4.0,,"We walked from Orchard Road to Clarke Quay though this park, it was a good escape from the city. There is a lot of history here so it is worth exploring to learn more about the city."
,,Madness in a good way,3.0,,"Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun , and while I am neither English or a dog , I was crazy enough to walk up all of those steps in the hottest part of the day ...........and you know what .......it was worth it , while it was a bit of a lungbuster for this overweight arthritic traveller the views are good , the shady trees and gentle breezes provide provide genuine relief . There were lots of locals having picnics , people ( crazy) exercising , strange birds in the trees and lizards in the grass and it's quiet . Once my wife and I got our second wind it was great , so just do it."
,,"Interesting, but will be better when the 'Battle Box' reopens",4.0,,It's amazing how peaceful this historic city-centre park is. Very helpful lady in the visitor centre.
,,Nice and Peaceful Walk - Not all park attractions were open,3.0,,"Nice park for a stroll with spice park, gardens, memorials, lookout etc. The Fitness corner is closed until 30 November 2015. And unfortunately the Battle Box is closed until February 2016. It does seem that some of the Singapore tourist sites don't advertise that well they are actually closed."
,,Historical hill - 2km circumference,4.0,,This hill is accessible from Dhoby Ghaut or Clarke Quay MRT stations - a short walk away. The circumference from the hill top is only 2km and it makes for a great place to run in the morning and evening.
,,Lovely Historical Walks,5.0,,This is a lovely place away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore. There are several routes to walk around the park and we chose to do the history trail. It was a fascinating trail with regular information boards and lots to look at. Its a beautiful old fort and we had a lovely walk - if you want to get away from it all for an hour or so then take a look.
,,Walk and see the sights,5.0,,"This is a great place to visit in the early mornign when there is no one around. A great place to get exercise, particularly going up and down the stairs."
,,A nice place to walk in the morning,4.0,,When I stay along the river I walk every morning. This is one of the places I try to get to because it's a bit more quite and peaceful. There is some interesting history to learn about here as well and a few well placed placards to help you. Enjoy the views from here as I do.
,,Beautiful old park,5.0,,"We didn't actually walk through this park but we stayed in a boutique old hotel with in the park. The park has lots of beautiful old lush green trees, lots of walking paths, good views & fairly quiet for the middle of the city."
,,A great park to stroll in,5.0,,Fort Canning Park has a number of thematic areas that are well laid out with easy walking trails. There is a Heritage Museum with interesting displays as well as a refurbished World War II bunker with a display of General Percival and his staff as they make the fateful decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese in 1942.
,,Interesting place and good views,4.0,,Well worth the uphill walk.Huge trees and lush foliage.Great views all around and quieter than some other places
,,Lovely walks; pity the trees block the views!,5.0,,"Walked up on a rainy morning which didn't spoil the experience. The history is very interesting and well signposted, and the gardens are lovely. The spice garden is great for anyone interested in either food or gardening."
,,Where heritage and nature go hand in hand,4.0,,"I love the history behind this place. There is a small heritage walk around the park that can be covered in an afternoon. So glad the memorials in the walls of the old Christian cemetery as well as some of the tombstones are preserved. You don't see these much anymore. Plus an archaeological excavation site right within the park itself! If you're into history do visit the Battle Box too (but this is closed till Jan 2016). This special place is heritage juxtaposed with nature. There's a huge field right in front of the new pinacotheque where you can do a picnic. Many picture-worthy scenery here. There's also a huge spice garden where you get to smell the mint, artemisia species, Indian borage, pandan leaves and many others.

There are two entrances to the park, both accessible via public transport. dhoby ghaut station and Clarke Quay station (the latter brings you to what I'd call the back entrance). The dhoby ghaut entrance is within walking distance to other attractions such as the malls, the national museum and philatelic museum, while the Clarke Quay station entrance is in close proximity to the Singapore River and Chinatown, just to name a few."
,,pleasant park,3.0,,"Although the park is beautifully maintained, there is not a lot to do here. There is a lot of walking, up step stairs or paths. I enjoyed the peacefulness of the area however with 1 gate, 2 cannons and a light house to look at, I was expecting more.

I would definitely recommend you go and look but don't budget for anything more than 1 hour. I was expecting a visitors centre with a map to show myself around but nothing."
,,Historical Park,4.0,,This park was part of our prenup shoot. I remember the clean grass and nice view shots! good for pictorials!
,,Place for a weekend picnic,5.0,,You can visit this place for a weekend picnic with your friends and family.. Certainly not a must visit place for the tourists but you can definitely go there for a stroll whilst you visit Clarke Quay... It's just a 5 mins walk from Clarke Quay.. You can see the first lighthouse of Singapore at this place which is definitely an attraction in itself...
,,A day in a forest in the middle of the city !,4.0,,"Well such place need a map , it's very nice holding a lot of greenly landscape but be aware of entrance and exits it could be exhausting going up and down without a map as the park is big enough to get lost inside , most of attractions like the battle box was closed for renovation so you could go just to enjoy the park , watch the art center and take some pictures !"
,,Beautiful park,4.0,,A beautiful park to visit and get away from the busy city streets. Lots to see so its well worth a visit!
,,great sunday outing,4.0,,"nice to have walk across the park, theres some nice hill top picture/selfie talking opportunities..."
,,Fabulous History,5.0,,Early morning walk and explore the history that surrounds this place and take in the views and fresh air.
,,A little slice of history,4.0,,"A site of huge historical significance, including the British surrender to the Japanese, with a lot of interesting detail and an air-conditioned exhibition area. Part of the park was cordoned off for a private event which meant we couldn't get to some of the old architecture. Information on the park shuttle seemed patchy and easy to miss - we were not able to catch it."
,,Lovely day out,4.0,,"A beautiful park, situated in the middle of the city. Very well maintained and some very interesting insights into Singapore's history on the various boards around. A variety of different things to see and do here. I was particularly interested in the WWII exhibits, go and see the Battle Box if you can. Afterwards cooled down with a beer in the Fort Canning Hotel which was very pleasant."
,,Very popular with locals for lunch,4.0,,"More by chance we 'crossed' this park, not knowing that it is a rather steep hill, finding groups of 'office workers' sitting left and right, on tarps, under trees, enjoying their lunch. There's lots of signage to be fascinated about, interesting bits of history and some nice views of the city. Worth checking out!"
,,Still One of My Favourite Park,5.0,,"It is by far my most favorite park in Singapore. It is located in the centre, not too crowded and conveniently located. Although the paid attractions are not really worth the price (as most Singapore attractions are), but I still enjoy visiting this park."
,,Great park and history,5.0,,"Only a 5 minute walk from City Hall MRT Station, Fort Canning Park is almost a hidden gem in Singapore - there were only about a dozen people there when I visited this afternoon. Although few of the original structures remain, there are dozens of excellent information boards dotted throughout the park detailing its history. There are a number of different, well marked and easy trails to follow too. Although small, I did enjoy walking through and on top of 'the gate' of Fort Canning, as well as seeing the cannons nearby. It's free and well worth spending an hour or two of your day here."
,,Fort Canning Park,4.0,,"Quite a lot of steps up to it, but I believe there may be an escalator somewhere which I could not find. Nice shady respite from the sun, but the views no longer exist."
,,A great urban park :),4.0,,"Quite easily accessible while in Singapore since it's like right in the middle of the city, this park is a great place to unwind your day after a hustle and bustle of shopping malls or that of just the general street life of Singapore (you know what that's like just after a few days you've been there!). Better yet, spend about two or three hours and go for a leisurely nature walk like I did from the north end of the park just behind Singapore National Museum to the south end (I pretty much stuck just to the east side of the park), checking out along the way: the ASEAN Sculpture Garden (just a few sculptures there though as far as I saw); the WW2 relic structures like the 'Battle Box' where British General Percival issued the order to surrender Singapore to the Japanese during the war, the hideout structure called Sally Port from which to surprise enemies, the little one-story building called OMSQ which stands for Old Married Soldiers' Quarters, the gate structure with something like a big munition storage box beside it; the Spice Garden (not that impressive or I maybe I didn't know what to expect in a ""spice garden""); the tomb of an ancient Malay ruler of the island; and finally the Maritime Corner with a lighthouse (the only such onshore navigational facility on the island back in the day), a historic flag mast (from colonial times but cut down by the Japanese during their occupation of the island and restored after the war), a little house where some treaty was signed or something. I've pretty much listed these places in order going from north to south although you may have to make a little circle around the area in the north to see the WW2 stuff mentioned above, the Spice Garden after those war relics is on the way from north to south, and the Maritime Corner is pretty much at the southeast corner of the park after which you could come down the set of stairs from the Raffles Terrace to Hill St. (same as Victoria St. as it's called a few blocks to the north) below and exit the park.

By public transportation, one way to get to the north end of the park (and make your way down south from there like I did) is taking the MRT to Bras Basah station (yellow line); once you're out on Bras Basah Rd., turn right and walk until you hit Bencoolen, then turn left and walk until you get to the end of Bencoolen and see the National Museum, then go over to the left side of the museum where you'll see the escalator going up to the park (the north end of the park); it will be just about ten minutes' walk from when you come up onto Bras Basah Rd. from the MRT until getting to the park.

Or if you'd rather go directly to the Maritime Corner where the Lighthouse is at the southeast corner of the park, one way to do that is to take the MRT to City Hall station (green & red lines, and yes a different station from Bras Basah mentioned above!); once you're on North Bridge Rd. after coming out of the station, walk south about one block (or half a block), then turn right onto Coleman, walk another block then left onto Hill, and then just past the Central Fire Station on the right side of the road you'll see the steps of the Raffles Terrace leading up to the park."
,,Interesting,3.0,,Came across this place by accident taking a shortcut from Robertson Quay into the city. It's really very interesting - as you walk up and down (and beware it is steep in parts) there are plaques that tell you the history of Singapore. My daughter has been to several open air concerts there
,,Lovely walk but hilly,5.0,,"Had a great walk through Fort Canning Park. However, we did not realise there were so many hills. In the heat of that day, we had to make several stops and were glad we had taken sufficient quantities of water. The herb garden was fascinating as were the statutes. The steep descent on the other side of the park led us to the creek and, further on, Chinatown or the High Street. Nice stroll for us."
,,An oasis of interest!,5.0,,"What a lovely retreat from the bustling streets of Singapore, even though you are in the heartbif the city. The flora and fauna are a sight to behold and the history of the Fort is so interesting. I haven't visited the Battle Box yet but will do on my next visit."
,,Great place also at night,5.0,,I had several hours to kill in a flight transit and was roaming around the city. Ended up alone in this park around midnight. It was so quiet and the smells coming from plants were very peculiar. If you have sensitive sense of smell i would recommend it at night. Very safe for a solo female traveller too.
,,wonderfull park .........,5.0,,"wonderful park ......... and on weekdays not many people. typical singapore, clean, well maintained, safe, very recomandable."
,,Lovely park with history,5.0,,Great park for an amble. This park has some remarkable trees and nice landscaping. It also has some interesting historical information to read on various plaques as you tour the park.
,,Peace in the middle of the city,5.0,,"This is a peaceful walk in nature in the midst of a bustling city. Being centrally located, it is easy to access and the paved trails make it easy for all levels of mobility."
,,Small and dull,3.0,,"Not alot of it is open, still closed for construction or they haven't started working on it yet. They seem to focus more on the laser quest and paint ball section than the actual history of the place."
,,A welcome relief from the streets of Singapore,3.0,,"If you are in Singapore for any length of time you will no doubt feel like just getting away from the hustle of life on the streets. Fort Canning Park is easy an to reach peaceful retreat that will let you recharge. Of historical significance, it is a good way to spend an hour or two before hitting the streets again"
,,history day,3.0,,"This is a welcome change to the concrete of modern Singapore. This is all about the history of Singapore and is situated on the 'forbidden hill'. The area is full of history and greenery.Plenty to do, suitable for families. Places to eat. There is a spice garden and walks to follow. Good day out. I would suggest an umbrella to keep the sun off a little."
,,Stunning views and a quiet paradise in the middle of the city,4.0,,"This was a lovely break accessible by public transport and a short walk from Clarke Quay. Walking around the well manicured gardens was very enjoyable. There are plenty of benches to rest and water fountains, drink vending machines and a couple of public toilets along the way. Both the city and the river can be viewed, and there are stunning trees and flowers for your viewing pleasure. We spent a couple of hours walking around but you can also see it in less time."
,,Better than a treadmill,3.0,,"If your hotel is nearby run the park in the early morning instead of a treadmill, ideally placed close the Clark Quay and is pleasant before the sun gets up and starts cooking everything."
,,Nice park,4.0,,"once you are up the hill and in the shade of the trees then it is a bit cooler, but still be prepared for a hot walk. Nice paths through spice garden and park. easy to get to via Dhoby Ghaut or Clarkes Quay MRT."
,,Fort canning,4.0,,This is a small fort up a hill . Singapore has preserved it as their heritage .They have a a gallery where they have different exhibitions . During the 50 yrs of golden jubilee celebration they had a theme of cleopatra . It was very nice . They have a small museum with their history intact . A nice change .
,,Great park,5.0,,Beautiful park to wander through to escape the traffic fumes and heat. Interpretive signs give an insight into the history of Singapore. Park is popular with joggers and walkers.
,,"Relaxing walk in the middle of the city. If you get too hot, just go into one of the museums to cool down",4.0,,"This park is on a hill, so wear cool clothing to prevent overheating. I was here on a business trip and I enjoyed doing a nice ""nature walk"" in this park instead of walking around the city. It is a very relaxing refuge from the city."
,,Small park near Clarke Quay,3.0,,Not much to see. The Battery Box is currently closed. The archeological diggings were very interesting.
,,Spent the day,5.0,,Walking around seen a great place with lots a historic item and gardens place to sit view from the gardens over the city It is a big walk but worth it a good down time no having to rush around and seeing the sites
,,Lovely and scenic park.,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park offers a wonderful opportunity to take a leisurely stroll through one of Singapore's older locations with historic relevance. The park can be accessed from a number of locations or the MRT station near Clarke Quay. There are a number of walking paths through the park and an opportunity of seeing some of the local wildlife - squirrels if you are lucky. The park is used as a fitness training area early mornings and there are a few places of interest throughout with some rest areas.
Well worth the effort up and down the small hill area - recommend earlier in the morning before it gets too hot."
,,Interesting tourist spot,4.0,,"A small hill in Singapore whereby it house the ""Black Box"" depicting the surrender of the Japanese during the Japanese occupation. You need to pay a small fee to see the exhibits.

Come prepared with water bottles as it is scorching hot in this open space and you are surrounded by greenery."
,,A wonderful atmosphere,5.0,,"Having dragged my wife, on foot, around Singapore for most of the day we decided to take some quiet time I the park. It was beautiful and lovely to see people going about their daily lives in a natural environment, there were people just sitting, others walking dogs, a wedding party and dancers doing the flamenco....a great way to relax at the end of the day."
,,Love the tunnel and walking track,5.0,,"A huge park with Singapore river, Marina Bay Sands, Merlion and Singapore Flyer at the corner. Love the tunnel and walking/jogging track"
,,Battlebox closed due to H&S,4.0,,"Dear fellow Red Dot Explorers - saw reference to the WWII Labrador Tunnels (next door to me in Labrador Park) in an old edition of ""Mighty Minds Fun Singapore"". They and the Battlebox at Fort Canning seem to have been closed for ages so I made enquiries of the Singapore Tourist Board and National Parks Board.
Qu: I understand the both the Battlebox and the Labrador Tunnels have been closed for renovation. Are you able to give any indication as to when they will reopen?
Ans: Thank you for interest in Labrador Nature Reserve. Just to clarify, the Battlebox and tunnels in Labrador Nature Reserve are closed due to the public safety concern instead of renovation. The Battlebox and tunnels will be closed until further notice.
Wouldn't hold your breath, then....."
,,Ok for a quick visit,3.0,,The park was ok for a quick walk. We had come to visit the Battlebox but it was closed. The lighthouse was interesting.
,,Peaceful and historical,5.0,,"A piece of quiet amidst the throng of the city malls and food centres. Nice to walk before 1030am - shops arent open anyway. I entered via Hill St - opp is Liang shopping centre for a kopi tiam type breakfast, climb steps to hill and follow the maps - well laid out and explains historical milestones every 50 metres or so. It is truly an oasis and you can see people doing their taichi or chinese sowrd exercises in the morning - just a small group. Walk across to the musuem, and then cut across front lawn to Singapore Musuem, and then head to Bras Basah MRT. Its all within 10misn each leg. Brilliant. And good to exercise all the hawker food of the previous day before the next meal. It will probably be my daliy exercise park when I'm next in Singapore around that area."
,,A place for respite from the heat of the day.,5.0,,"Apart from having historical significance, keep your eyes and ears open whilst exploring. Bird calls abound. We also watched and photographed a small squirrel finding and eating an apple. There are plenty of signs to assist you as you explore. Steps are numerous and quite steep, but worth the climb. Don't forget your camera."
,,WW2 history,4.0,,"Excellent free attraction, short walk from our hotel, short steep climb to the top and pleasant stroll back - wanted to see the underground tunnels but these were closed for repair."
,,A place for history buffs,5.0,,"I tend to be drawn to places of historical significance, when when I found out about this place I immediately put it on my itinerary. Basically it is where the original colonial fort was located, and you can still see the remnants around the park, including the old gate as well as the lighthouse on Raffles Terrace, which was where ships entering the harbour would be signalled. The 'Battle Box', which was where the allied commanders during World War II would be bunkered down (though unfortunately it was closed when I visited). You can also find an archeological dig where they have found the ruins of a pre-colonial city. The park is also really tranquil to walk around, though you will find a number of signs talking about the historical aspects of the park. Oh, there is also an art gallery right in the middle (well, not quite in the middle because there is a reservoir there, but it is in the park nonetheless)."
,,Tranquil and surprising.,5.0,,A beautiful tranquil place to wander around and relax. The spice gardens are a real treat. The buildings and sculptures are amazing and great for photo opportunitites. When the Battle Box reopens it is well worth a visit.
,,Great for an early morning walk..,5.0,,"We were in the Clarke Quay area, so this park was literally across the road. It was great for the early morning walks / runs and from where we were, there was a serious set of stairs that would been a cardio work out for anyone.

Local history abounds in the place and you could either leisurely stroll around, or do the fitness thing.."
,,Green heart in Singapore,5.0,,The Fort Canning Park is a beautiful place to relax and to escape the business of Orchard Road. We spend some time in Fort Canning Hoel and used the park for our morning jogging activities.
,,Caution: Uphill,2.0,,This is our first stop. We were there around 8am. The wide canopy of trees bring shade and cool air. Be prepared for the uphill climb. We were contented with the view at Percival Road.
,,Night visit-still a great view,4.0,,"I was only able to visit right after sunset. I still got to read some interesting signs posted on the history of the park, as well as night views of the city. Hope to vgo again on my next trip during the daytime."
,,A park near Clark Quay,5.0,,A nice stroll in this park gives good views at the top of the hill by the fort. It's easily accessible from Clark Quay as its located just behind it.
,,Nice area for a walk,4.0,,This park is an historical site with a museum and a pleasant park. A nice contrast to the urban and noisy areas around. An additional bonus are the flights of stairs you can run up and down for exercise!
,,"Maritime Corner, at Fort Canning",4.0,,"Located in the middle of Singapore, the Maritime Corner at Fort Canning Park will gives you a new insight of the history of early port in this country. A great place for walking, enjoying fresh air and get away from the busy city of Singapore for a while"
,,A tranquil place across other side of busy Orchard Road....,3.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a sharp contrast to nearby busy Orchard Road.

The tranquility amidst the forested environment gives one a sense of peace and time just slowed down.
Take an unhurried stroll along the quiet beautiful park .There is history in this place, which one can learn so much about. Enjoy nature with the sound of birds & insects.

This place is up on the hill & not prominently visible from Orchard Road. Unless you are aware of this place, you probably won't even realise it is just a short walk on the other side of Orchard Road.

To get there, come out from Dhoby Ghaut MRT. Cross over to Park Mall
Shopping Centre. Take the lift here to Level 4. Turn right & exit into the carpark( glass door). Once in carpark, turn left & walk straight to car park exit ( about 10 lots away). From the car park exit, you can see Fort Canning Park across the road.

There is always a security guard at this car park exit, so please ask him/her if still unsure.

Definitely worth a visit here."
,,Get away from the city.,5.0,,Great location right in the middle of the city to get away from everyone and learn a little about the history of Singapore. Go early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the heat.
,,Take a walk or even jog through this park,5.0,,A beautiful park in the city lots of relics and history. Spent a hour or so wander around the park.. If you jog then I'd highly recommend it. Kids also enjoyed it. Very close to Clarke Quay if you are staying I that area.
,,The pride of Singapore,5.0,,"Nestling Accross the busy Orchard road is the walkers paradise Fort canning . The old house of Raffle - the founding father of Singapore is a nostalgic, delight . The fragrance of the Frangipani in the early hours awakens the senses .The enchanting fort canning is well spread in all sides - giving a clear view of the down town business district . There are four approach entrances with well connected public tranport bus stops . Beautiful restorant in the centre offers much welcome meals which are very exclusive but memorable . The museum , and the an old Dargah of the Muslim ruler are located in this park .Worthn making a trip .but , good walking shoes needed for the experience of walking a pleasure here ."
,,Nice garden full of spice. Nice hiking place.,3.0,,This was a paradise for taking wedding photographs. They also have a pretty wide collection of spices and condiments. Some people just go there to pluck the spices they need for cooking... like curry leaves and so on. It's a nice quite place for exploring nature and history of Singapore as well.
,,Singapore's First Botanic Garden Remains Tranquil and Lovely,4.0,,"A group of us walked through this beautiful park with the Maritime Trails organization. We saw the archaeologic digs, the cannon, Raffles house, the lighthouse, and gorgeous picnic areas. I will definitely visit this oasis of beauty regularly."
,,Nice Park,4.0,,"it was a really nice Park to walk around, Fort Canning was really interesting to look at, lovely kept Garden and Lawn and well worth a look, if you looking for something different to do."
,,Interest walk in beautiful park,4.0,,Very enjoyable walking tour. Giving information about history and also the flora. Very much local hangout spending pleasant days staying cool in the shade. Nice alternative if you do not have time for the Ridges.
,,Tranquil experience,5.0,,D Graves were over 200 yrs n beyond. Very pretty lawn. Its in between national meuseum and philosophy meuseum
,,A calm and serene place in the centre of the city,3.0,,Fort Canning park is located on a hill on the River valley road. The atmosphere here is just the opposite of what you find in the neighbourhood. It is extremely surprising to find this place this way when the Clarke quay next to it is full of life and noise. Anyway the walk is very nice and place is well maintained but nothing much to see here..If your trip is for 7 days or more you can visit this place .Does not merit a visit for shorter trips.
,,A Tranquil Park In The Heart Of The City!,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is located close to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station.

Its lush greenery offers a tranquil oasis where you are just minutes away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

Within its grounds are a wide big lawn where concerts/ music festivals/ performances are held, old military bunkers, and even a hotel housed in a historic building.

Its can be hilly at some points, so you will have to climb stairs to get around.

This is a nice park to visit, that's located in the heart of the city!"
,,Cool calm and peaceful,5.0,,"A great place to learn some history and escape from the bustle of the city, watch out for squirrels. :-). Aim for 4-5 to start when its cooler and the best place to get up the hill is behind the museum."
,,Nice walk and a history lesson,3.0,,Fort Canning is a former location for royalty to live and was turned into a fort used to defend the country. It is a low stress hike/walk and has a few panels to read about the history of Singapore. They occasionally have a concert in the park but they can get crowded. This isn't a must see attraction but if you are sightseeing in the Clark Quay area give it a shot.
,,"Good, if you want to see some green space in the concrete jungle",4.0,,"Good place to break a tour although the steps and the climb up are a bit of a killer. Once up there, you are in a very beautiful, peaceful world and there are good toilets and refreshments. I agree, it is probably not worth a special trip."
,,Nice escape right in the city,4.0,,Nice for a touch of rain forrest and history right by the city. Maybe not worth a dedicated visit but well worth a stroll if nearby.
,,Relax and disappear,5.0,,"This area is so relaxing for a long slow stroll or a quick pace for exercise. View's nature, gardens, history. Very safe."
,,"Fort Canning Park, Singapore",5.0,,"A once British fort that overlooked the harbour of Singapore now redone as a city park. Most of the buildings have long gone but some walls and cannons remain along with the lighthouse, signal mast and time ball. The many park trees and nearby skyscrapers now block the view but it's still worth taking a couple of hours to stroll around this peaceful place and to read the notices that give you the history of Singapore."
,,"Historic, Interesting",5.0,,The 'Battle Box' Museum is fascinating and well worth the visit. Nice park and gardens. Close enough to walk from other interesting locations.
,,History is well preserved!,5.0,,"This place is hidden in the middle of the city contains full of history, stories and other hidden jems. During WW2 this place is used to protect Singapore against the Japanese. It also where you can find the original botanic garden that Raffles build. And there also a cemetery that is now used for concerts and orchestra. It amazed me how this fort is well preserved through Singapore changes. 1 day ill come back there again with my daughter and my wife. :)"
,,Pretty but plenty of mosquitos.,4.0,,The place was a nice visit. Middle of the city and easy to get to from the Bras Basah MRT. Be careful of mosquitos. Bringing something like citronella might help.
,,Enjoyable park in the city,4.0,,We walked around this pretty large park during our trip to Singapore. It is situated on a hill and has several trails. The trees were quite impressive and the scenery was pretty. There was a wedding going on in one portion of the park.
,,Singapore hidden gem! Enjoy the beauty of Ft Canning! Walk or Run!,5.0,,"I lived in Singpaore for a year and spent every weekend walking/running around this beautiful and historic site. Ft. Canning was the highest point in Singapore and dates back centuries with some of the most interesting stories. There are three different levels of paved pathways that wrap around the area of Fort Canning. Each level represents a different centuries and cultural challenges of their times. Some of the views like the one you can encounter at Raffles house are really neat. Stop by Raffles house which has 3 large flag poles which were used to signal merchant ships coming into Singapore.

The pathways are great for running/walking as they are paved wide and some of trails go through narrow paths which make you feel like you are in a jungle. The general pathway around the top is easy to walk for seniors or kids but the harder trails that will challenge a runner are lower and rise to the top level. The nice part of running there is you can challenge yourself to different levels and stairs or just limit your run to the top which has limited stairs. If you have young kids or seniors consider taking a taxi to the top of the main Fort.
Most of the area is shade so it is a nice break from the sun and make sure you bring water. There are plenty of water stations but a little hard to find. The 2 World War history is interesting but limited but it is interesting to see the Sally ports & gates were the British surrendered to the Japanese. There is not much to see in terms of an old fort as the area is only what has been left and not restored into a tourist trap.
The kids will like the cannons next to Ft. Fort. At the very top is best place for taking pictures and you will a lot of brides & grooms having there pictures taken.
Just a warning about the stairs on the walk to the top there are a lot of them but again you can avoid them by taking a taxi to the top. Their are numerous entry & exit points around the fort that can drop you off in various parts of the city to explore.
The general pathway around the top is easy to walk for seniors or kids but the harder trails that will challenge a runner are lower but I found running them all was great but what a work out on the stairs! If you have kids or seniors consider taking a taxi to the top of the main Fort.
What I also enjoyed about Ft Canning was it was not a tourist trap and not been commercialized. Hope you enjoy this beautiful place!"
,,One of My Favorites,5.0,,"I read about Fort Canning in one of those Top 10 Guides. The guide (which was wrong about many things) recommended a 2 to 3 hour visit. I thought...OK...an hour. Well, I was there for 3 hours and could have stayed longer except I was thirsty (bring water). It was a beautiful, quiet, and restful place to visit (on a Saturday Morning, no less). There is no entry fee and it is a great place to learn about Singapore's historical beginnings from the 13th through 19th century. I recommend following the 14th Century Walk. It was beautiful and fascinating."
,,Historical park,4.0,,"This is something what I really recommend! It is not even take long time to walk it from start to the end. I was there maybe 2 hours, just walked around and take some pictures.. there is something for history lovers - signs what tell you what happened in Singapore and in which decade. It is actually very interesting.
There is one very old gate (sorry can't remember name..), you can go up to that gate. There is small hole where you need to go and just take stairs up. There is beautiful view :)"
,,Everything we went for was closed,2.0,,"We went to the park because my husband was interested in the WW2 history - the visitors centre was shut for renovations and the battle box was closed too. We could not access anything we went for, so it was a waste of time for us."
,,Peaceful Place in City Center,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is worth for a few hours tour, maybe it doesn't have too much attractive sights, but this is a very quiet place. When you walk through the path in the park, you can hear birds twittering around you. Local people jogging in park. It's quite nice place if you want to jump out from busy life.
By the way, it is easy to access to National Museum from the Park."
,,secret entrance to top of the watch tower,4.0,,"behind the heavy door into the watch tower, there is a small entrance that reveals stairs that lead to the top of the watch tower. not much view to speak of, but nice to find a different angle to see the place. each step is very high though, be careful when going up and down.

good for jogging too, but not much sheltered spots if it rains."
,,Wonderful relaxing walk in the middle of the city.,5.0,,Take about an hour and stroll the walks through this park. Take your time and enjoy some beautiful foliage. We did the walk after we visited the National Musuem. We excited at Clark Quay and then walked across the street to take the river boat ride. It was very relaxing and there are lots of shady areas.
,,Amazing green and historic place in the heart of the city center,4.0,,"A beautiful spot right in the middle of the busy city center. Fort Canning Park is an ideal place for walking, enjoying nature and to catch a breath from the busy city life. This place has quite some historic value. First accounts of habitation date back to the 14th century. Lots of important people lived here (for example Raffles himself). There are remnants of fortifications and there even is a bunker dug out in the hill. You can also admire the old lighthouse that once guided ships into the harbor of Singapore or go on two different walks which offer some interesting background information about the history of this hill. Nature lovers will be pleased too, lots of gorgeous, beautiful trees and flowers. There is even a spice garden for those who love to cook.

When I visited Fort Canning Park, the Fort Canning Center was being renovated, but I'll expect the renovation will be finished by summer for the celebrations of 50 years Singapore. Sadly I wasn't possible to enter the bunker and corridors dug out in the hill at this time."
,,Interesting spot,5.0,,"I really enjoyed this. The history, the park and the various views. It takes a while to take in everything but if you don't mind walking- you will enjoy it. It's very well maintained ( as to be expected) and would suit all ages."
,,Lush!,5.0,,This is one of my favourite places in Singapore. It is a lovely place to learn about the history and is spectacular and green. The graveyard is a serene place and gives a fantastic insight into the British Colonization of Singapore.
,,Green tranquil space,4.0,,"Extremely well tended park with interpretive boards.

You can tell that Singapore put a lot of effort into preserving this place. Made me very happy to be here.

It can be quite steep to get from bottom to top, but to surround yourself in this wonderful green space is worth it."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Worth the visit of this green , peaceful park based around an early English settlement. Well maintained and with very good signage that both helps you move round the site and also provides a lot of information on Singapore history.

Allow 1-2 hours for the visit and be prepared for walking up and down steps. Lots of trees and very green.

I often take visitors from the rush of Orchard road (Dhoby Ghaut MRT) via the park (green and quiet) and walk to Clarke Quay (or vice versa). This gives a view of different aspects of Singapore, plus a bit of history with some exercise ..then you have earned a beer at Clarke Quay.!"
,,Beautiful greenery in Singapore,5.0,,"Went to this park for a wedding ceremony. Definitely worth a visit and walk around, the greenery is awe inspiring."
,,Tranquility,4.0,,"I encourage all travellers to find 1 - 2 hours to stroll around Fort Canning Park. Very tranquil and a fascinating insight into Singapore's history, particularly during the 2nd World War. Lovely place for a picnic too. Easy walking, no steep hills and very shaded."
,,Terriffic overview of early Singapore,5.0,,"A ""must see"" area of Singapore history, notably of early English settlement. A vast amount of earthworks done here over time particularly the levelling of the top of this hill to create a 7 acre flat building area in the 1860's (no machines in that time, only man power). An interesting 1-2 hours wandering around imagining a past era. Well signed with information."
,,Historic site,4.0,,We stumbled upon the fort as we were walking towards Raffles Hotel. The stairs leading up were a bit of a climb but manageable. The views from the top are quite good in place but the trees do hide some of it away. Some of the buildings on the hill are being renovated so we couldn't see as much as we would have liked. Still worth a visit
,,"History, Tranquility, and a bit of view too",4.0,,"I wanted to check out the vistas from Fort Canning on my last day in SIN. As it turned out I had the park more of less to myself because I was strolling through in the midst of a torrential rainstorm. Quite frankly the tranquility in the hard rain made for a lovely diversion from the urban activity below. Fort Canning isn't terribly high and there is a reservoir on most of the top of the hill anyways, but there was a good view looking onto Clarke Quay and the Central Business District too. Wandering the paths I learned a few things about Singapore's history from multilingual display boards dotting the paths. On the back side of the hill there (opposite the Clarke Quay park entrance) was a historic lighthouse lamp that once had been atop Fort Canning. That was very interesting maritime history
It should be noted that the Battle Box museum seems to be closed indefinitely for some renovations. I was hoping for a chance to see the Battle Box, but the entrance is sealed off with a notice. Otherwise, there was a lot renovating going on with the old military buildings in the park. Give yourself a bit over an hour to leisurely saunter around and savor the green elevated island of tranquility."
,,Lovely greenery and flowers and trees and old remains,4.0,,"The greenery was just amazing, its a green gem right in the middle of the city. You got a bit of a climb to go up tot he old fort. Reccomend late evening to watch the sunset or go jogging through the curving paths up and down hill. The trees and the green grass on the top is great for a picnic as well. Just to forge the cement buildings and pretend to be in a jungle is just lovely :)"
,,An oasis of history.,5.0,,"Fort Canning park is a wonderful oasis in the heart of the city. Whether it is history, nature, exercise or a combination of all three then the park is the place to go. Seeing the old fortifications, the trees and the lack of people all around makes it very different from the average tourist time in Singapore. This is not to be missed if only as a chance to de-retail. Read a little about it beforehand and you'll enjoy it even more."
,,A glimpse of history,4.0,,"The park is the only real hill on the island and is an oasis above the busy traffic and hectic cafe and bar scene. It can feel a stiff climb in the heat but it is worth it for the views, for the greenery and for the history."
,,Peace and quiet in the center,5.0,,"A lovely place near the Singapore museum and its great for a 1 hour stroll in the nature. Also has some very informative boards with interesting historical facts. The park has several entrances and exits, to all sides of the city, which is very convenient."
,,Peace and Calm,4.0,,"On a Monday morning with few people around, the park was an oasis of calm and beauty. There were certainly more species of bird around that present in the Botanic gardens over the preceding weekend. Plenty of trees and shade to get some respite from the sun.
The only downside was that the Battle Box museum was not open. A group of architecural surveyors entered whilst we were there and we were advised it would not be open until the end of 2015."
,,Peaceful place to pass a couple of hours,4.0,,"We wandered around this park for a couple of hours and really enjoyed the tranquility.
The spice garden is lovely and smells delicious!
We visited on a Sunday afrernoon and saw many locals and tourists enjoying picnics along the banks. We even came across a wedding ceremony!
There were a few disappointments in that some parts are closed off or gated up in a not very attractive manner but the place is so big you hardly notice.
Parts of the park are very hilly/steep so bring your walking shoes for these hills and the many many steps!"
,,A Well maintained park,3.0,,"I am lucky enough to stay in front of fort canning park for almost an year. The park is very well maintained. While walking though the park , you can read about the singapore history details. You can find lot of big trees and feel the forest.
The place is also good more morning and evening jogging, as the park has lot of steps to climb and places to exercise. if you enjoy nature, this is a must visit place."
,,An Oasis...,4.0,,"A bit fed up with the high rise building site that is Singapore, we sought out Fort Canning Park, and what a treat it was. Mrs. Flyingbluedog heavily into cooking and the Spice Garden there was a treat for her! Must admit I enjoyed it too, being able to touch and sniff the plants.
Some nice gentle walks around the reservoir at the top (not visible and fenced off with barb wire topped chain link ‚ÄìI guess it‚Äôs Sings main source of water.)
Sounds of all the different birds were delightful, all that seemed to be missing from the rest of Sing.
Planting was lush and many of the plants were labelled comprehensively and this helped us to enjoy it all the more, enhancing the whole experience.
There were no refreshments available as the kiosk was being rebuilt.
This was an oasis of calm before descending back into Sing."
,,Quiet place lies in the center of the city,4.0,,"Unlike Botanic Garden, which is located a little bit far from the city center, this place lies right in the heart of the city. Used to be an army fort, now this place is really quiet and covered with so many tree. A good place to walk and relieve any stress."
,,Singapore's real history in one place,5.0,,Take the 14th century walk. It is self-guided and easy to understand. Fort canning was once a palace surrounded by water and its form justifies it. That is why it has steep stairs. It is also the ultimate proof that Singapore's natives were malays. This hailed land also carries the transition of hinduism to Islam when Islam came about in Singapore in the 14th century. This place should be visited and studied not only by tourists but also recommended for Singaporeans themselves.
,,Most of the sites under renovation,3.0,,"As others mention here, there are many of the sites in this lovely park that are under renovation, hence we didn't really get the experience we had hoped for. The park itself is lovely and nice to walk around. One of many green oasis in Singapore."
,,battle box open,4.0,,"There`s a lot of people on here complaining about the fact that the Battle Box seems to be closed indefinitely. Well it may be to the general public who just want to go there on a one off trip. HOWEVER if you book the excellent ""Fog of War"" trip through the Historical Society of Singapore, it includes entry to the Battle Box with a guide along with many other military positions visited.
I found them through a leaflet in hotel reception to do with The Changi Museum, booked both of the trips on offer & was pleased with them both, gave me a break from wandering round endless shopping malls with her indoors!!!!"
,,Nature and history,5.0,,"Great place to relax and picnic.

History: Battle box - WW2 bunker (under renovation til late 2015), 9 pound cannon from 19th C, archaeological digging site, old Fort gate.

Nature: lots of different tree species, as well as a spice garden, among other things.

Art: different sculptures"
,,"Fresh air, fun, exercise, nature and history",5.0,,"While the visitor's centre and the battle bunker are closed, this does not mean there is nothing to see here! There are plenty of historic sights to see at this park. You can also enjoy the beautiful plants, and read the signage at points of interest. You'll find this place a good location to get some exercise and some fresh air. We enjoyed visiting the site of the 1860s fort, the 14th century site, and we took part of the 14th century walk. We saw a few lizards and squirrels.

We tried to walk here from Dhoby Ghaut MRT, but we had trouble finding the underpass. Its still easy to get across the road though.

After our visit we went to the Fabulous Baker Boy for our lunch."
,,fort canning,4.0,,"A great place for the long peaceful walk. A charming and clean park, it is no wonder many couples come here for their wedding photo shoot."
,,Park of a different kind,4.0,,A very nice place just next to Orchard. Good Place to relax and have a small picnic. A very good walk also for couples. I would suggest carrying some food and drinks and there are very less options available inside. Some construction work in going on at the moment.
,,Worth a stroll,4.0,,Quite a nice park to go for a casual stroll & take some time to chill out from the city. It's very humid though (like all of Singapore).
,,Worth too see,4.0,,"We did a walk around the park and found it enjoyable.
It was very peaceful area considering that it's in the city.
Walkways were very clean and tidy, the stairs from the bottom to the top was manageable.
Great place to go if you like parks & history."
,,Charming city centre park,5.0,,"The sign of a good city is the amount of green space it sets aside for people to take a break from their hectic lives. For a small island-state Singapore has done magnificently to ensure its citizens are within a short stroll of greenery, and rightly deserves the title of 'garden city'. Fort Canning
Park epitomises this ethos. Whenever we are in Singapore we ensure we have at least one visit to the park as it embraces so many features. There are beautifully laid out paths, giant mature trees and shrubs, historic artefacts in an historic setting, old colonial buildings beautifully restored to their former glory, a burial ground, a lighthouse, wildlife, sculptures, and it's elevated position affords great views of the surrounding high rise buildings. We usually spend a few hours here just wondering up and down the various paths taking in the sights, sounds and fresh smells if visiting after a rain shower (but avoid thundery weather). On our latest visit the park can alive with the sound of school children enjoying an educational visit. The park authorities are to be congratulated for their ongoing maintenance of such an historic site. If visiting Singapore, and you tire of business or shopping then I recommend heading for Fort Canning to recharge your batteries."
,,worth a visit,5.0,,"a must is to visit the 'battle Box' where a mock up of the British Army's operation centre at the time of the Japanese invasion is available to walk through and learn the history involved. There are many exhibits, all underground."
,,MEMORY HILL,4.0,,"Located on a hill, Fort Canning Park is on 18-hectare space is chock full of attractions is one of Singapore's most historic landmarks. Today, Fort Canning Park distinctive charm remains. Its ancient artifacts are a must-see for history buffs, and its lush greenery and expansive lawns offer a variety of arts, heritage and nature experiences. The outdoor lawns draw picnics, concerts, theatre productions and festivals, while weddings, parties and gatherings are a regular sight in the park's elegant indoor function rooms, and more recently, some of the world‚Äôs biggest music acts played to screaming audiences. Some highlights include the Maritime Corner which tells the story of Singapore's evolution from an entrepot trading post to an international maritime centre, and the Fort Gate, is a great entrance experience a remnant of a fortress built in the 19th Century. the Spice Garden, the ASEAN Sculpture Garden and Battle Box is worth the visit, the park is Situated in central Singapore, the hill leads down to the famous shopping belt of Orchard Road, while the National Museum sits just behind, accessible by an escalator. It‚Äôs worth the stroll around the hill."
,,Interesting and historical,5.0,,"I walked to Fort Canning from the hotel. Start early , carry water and have an umbrella. The area is very big and takes time to see it all. You need to be somewhat fit and you need to walk up a steep hill. The pathways are well maintained . When I went there was only one other person that I saw and a couple but Singapore is so safe , you should feel ok. There are a number of workers there , so that's a comfort. For a woman, I would go with someone as it can be quite isolated. Unfortunately, the old HQ and bunker was under renovations but one could visualize what it would have been like during the war when the Brits and allied troops were surrounded . I would start at the north end and then you would end up downtown and are able to see other sights. Watch for any thunderclouds for all the signs say to get off the hill if there is a storm. Every day when we were there , there were fierce storms that last from 1 to 2 hrs. On another day, I went to the Fort (which is really a park) at the entrance near the old police station on Hill St. right beside the river. You can see the original light house and there is a nice park like atmosphere. People were walking and having lunch etc. Everything is so well maintained."
,,Great place to get married,3.0,,I suppose the nearest Metro station is Dhoby Gaout. 10 mins walk and you enter the Park walking up the steps going through the Fort Canning hotel. Very elegant hotel with chic lobby. The Park itself apart from few historical sites has very little to offer. There are nicer parks in Singapore.
,,Fulfilled a need for some bucolic solace,4.0,,"Now and then one just needs some peace and quiet, paths to roam and fresh air. I arrived at the park on the Clark Quay side and the steps up to the reservoir are a little bit daunting but worth the climb to then wander the pathways and enjoy the greenery.

Nothing exciting here. Just a peaceful parkland area - which is sometimes all one needs."
,,Wow Factor,5.0,,"A very pleasant place to visit. Hard to believe a place like this was shelled and involved in a war back in 1942. Our visit here was 2009 and after just getting off the plane the day before, it offered a cooler climate to the heat due to the vegetation. Must visit and will be back."
,,Peaceful escape,4.0,,"This is a good choice when you need some peace and quiet and don't want to travel too far from the city area. Bit of a hike to get there, but once you're actually at Fort Canning it's easy enough to walk around."
,,Nice But No Hyde Or Central Park,3.0,,"There are a number of famous parks that are smacked right in the city center. Hyde Park and Central Park are two. In comparison with these, Fort Canning is missing a pond, fountain, more shelters, caf√© and drink fountains, and events. In recent times, concerts at FC are rare. Situated on a hill, few visitors use the park as a shortcut from one side to another side whilst savouring the flora and fauna, just like at Central or Hyde Park. Imagine you will need to go up and down the numerous stairs on a humid day. Occasionally one can find wildlife - chameleon, snakes, wild pheasants and civets. It is also an excellent joggling trial. The air is fresh and cityscapes breath-taking during a sunset jog-through. Guests at the Hotel Fort Canning would love this park. Although Singapore is branded as a clean and green city, I found a number of paths littered with rubbish and empty cans. I have always wondered how the experience will be enhanced if the shelters and paths are equipped with moist sprays to keep temperature down ! Check National Parks website for any events. The nearest subway is Clarke Quay MRT. Battle Box and the Fort Canning Art Center are closed for renovation. There is a 100-year old reservoir at the top of the hill. The sculpture park next to it is desolate and ""lonely"". Visit FC to include the Hotel, Battle Box when opened, the Fort Canning Cemetery, the MICA arts building (old Hill Street Police Station), Karamat shrine, the Central Fire Station, Stamp Museum, Peranakan Museum and Armenian Church, all within 3-4 hours or so."
,,Nice to be away from the real city,4.0,,"Nice green area, on a hill, so be prepared for ups and downs!. Spice garden, sculpture area, some old cannons and others buildings plus an archaeological dig. Lots of guidance points and directions around the park. Easily walkable to parts of the city."
,,A wonderful Park,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a Park built around the place wher Stamfort Raffles built his house. The Park contains a spice garden, a water reservois, a hotel complex, a small sculpture park and a bunker complex of WW2. In case rain shows there a couple of places to take shelter. Warning signs indicate not to enter the park during or shortly after a storm - but who would ?! The only drawback i found was the public toilets. Due zo construction works, these are more....mobile ones as on construction sites..."
,,Peaceful Park missing the History,3.0,,"This is a beautiful and peaceful park with little crowds BECAUSE a fort is best served on a hill so the location does mean some walking and the main roads and stairs can make it difficult to get to including from the MRT station Dhobby Gaut.

Disappointly the battle box is closed and the main building under rennovation plus otehr parts fenced off. You can see the battle box entrance, story baord plus fort gates and it is free to visit. Because of the greenery, it gets very humid there so be prepared.

IWANTED TO GIVE THIS 4-5 STAR RATING BUT UNTIL THE BATTLE BOX IS RESTORED AND RE-OPENED IT MISSES THE HISTORY, NO REAL CANNONS OR HISTORICAL ARTIFACTS."
,,Huge free park in the middle of Singapore,4.0,,We enjoyed a relaxing walk in Fort Canning Park after seeing Orchard Road. The park is huge and can take a couple of hours to walk around. We particularly enjoyed the spice garden!
,,Lovely park - Battle Box closed though,4.0,,Nice park to spend a few hours walking round. Lots of plants to see and old structures to look at. Sadly the Battle Box is closed for refurbishment.
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Spend a few leisurely hours wandering around this garden admiring all the wonderful plants. The old relics are interesting, loved the steep staircase above the old gate."
,,A good way to admire nature,4.0,,The area around YWCA Fort Canning Lodge is made pleasant by the scenery of Fort Canning Park. One feels like walking down memory lane while admiring the nature around Fort Canning Park.
,,Battle Box - Still Closed,1.0,,"Renovations!!
Battle Box is still closed.

I went to the Battle Box in May 2013 and it was closed for ""minor works""
I went there again in August 2014 and still closed.

Many thousands of British tourists come to Singapore every month with many looking to see where their relatives fought and died during WW2.

Singapore get your act together this really is very poor!!."
,,Peaceful escape,5.0,,"Green, quiet and tranquil, this was the first botanic garden to be created so it's full of lovely plantlife. We visited on a Sunday and found it occupied by families enjoying picnics, old men doing tai chi, young couple strolling. It is a huge park so you can always find a corner to yourself to chill out in. There are toilets etc. There is quite a flight of steps to get into the park but it is worth the climb."
,,Civilized Jungle,5.0,,"In Singapore there is a large park on the hill which once was important for the security and governing of the island. Now it is the most wonderful walking park with many paths and plants (trees, flowers, etc.) that thrive in the tropics. Allow yourself several hours to enjoy this park. It is good to start at the Herb Garden and see all the many spices that once made Singapore the popular commercial center it is today. Then a little farther up the trail there is an archeological excavation which describes a lot of the history of the ""fort"". Beyond that are vegetation of all types as you circle around the hill. The views of the city in every direction are outstanding. Although it does not get much press, this is a very worthwhile place to put in a few hours."
,,Refreshing!,5.0,,"Its a long walk but worth every step. Very refreshing and once you reach the top, the view is amazing. Centre of singapore and well maintained."
,,Good history and morning excercise,5.0,,Park contains organised tours through the war bunkers. Also a great park to do morning jogs around. Very fresh air at the park within inner city.
,,Great morning run!,5.0,,"Smacked in the heart of the city, Fort Canning Park is definitely a must-visit when in SG.

It's a good place for a morning stroll or run. I enjoyed running and exploring around and at the same time, it was also interesting to learn more about the history of singapore."
,,Serene beauty,4.0,,Took a stroll through this park and learned a little history and enjoyed the spice/herb garden. Even found a wandering rooster.
,,Great Place,4.0,,"A hidden gem in Singapore, just walk around and take in the history of the place. Raffles built his home here. The WW2 Battle Box is located here. The old Grave yard is also here. A must see and do."
,,Nice place in the afternoon,4.0,,"Its near Dhoby Gaut station. Near from Cathay cinema. Need to walk to reach this place. Its very convenient environment. There are many trees in here. You will enjoy this place. Its historic place either, inside there have underground called 'battle box'."
,,Fantastic place to spend an afternoon,5.0,,"Fort Canning Park is just a short walk from Orchard Road and goes all the way to Clarke Quay. So it is right in the center of the city and you can walk in from either of these two places. I like to walk from Orchard and end at Clarke Quay for lunch or dinner. There are amazing trees and plants in the park. I have been to Fort Canning Park probably a dozen times, but I have never actually explored the fort areas of the park. The nature is what draws me in. There are a couple of absolutely colossal Banyan trees and some other trees that I don't know the names of. There is a tree that spans a football field that is just down the hill directly below the lighthouse. It is amazing, and I attach a pic I took that doesn't do it justice. It is one of my favorite places in Singapore and I love spending an afternoon or morning in the park. Free to enter as usual in Singapore."
,,An interesting walk!,5.0,,"I was told about this park & had to visit..after climbing loads of steps on the City side...had a lovely view from the top over parts of the city below. loved the various trees (some huge) & lovely plants...a very well kept park....i went on quite a hot & humid day...so that had some disadvantages lol..sweating lots!!..got to the old Fort area & that was worth a walk around, enjoyed the huge gateway (see photo)..I'm glad i visited this park must....i then walked through the Gateway, walking down hill, which took me past the Fort Canning hotel...(i would certainly consider staying here for a few nights). I would certainly recommend this park...however i was approached a few times by beggers..i was on my own...so maybe go with someone!!"
,,A mixture,3.0,,"Was here in November 2013, during my walk around Fort Canning Park there is a variety of trees and vegetation. I was really interested in the Battle Box in the park. If you read other reviews it is closed, but you can see the entrance into the fortification and other parts that are visible above ground. I would definitely recommend that you be a regular walker or have good fitness levels, there are a lot of stairs to fully explore this area.

Also pick the time of day you go, I was caught in a tropical rain shower in the late afternoon. However I did enjoy the walk around Fort Canning."
,,Nice park,4.0,,"It is a nice for a stroll or run, and they have theatre in the open air quite often too. If you are looking for a good workout, try running up the many sets of stairs!"
,,An overlooked gem,5.0,,I come to Singapore regularly but it was only recently that I discovered Fort Canning Park -recommended to me by a resident. Now I never miss it. There it is right in the middle of downtown. A green oasis and well explained history to see too. Especially good if you don't have much time and want to stretch your legs.
,,A real treasure amidst modern town,5.0,,It's almost unbelievable there's an old place hiding among this modern city of Singapore! The place is right behind the Clarke Quay tourist attraction. Walking through lush & green garden all the way up to an ancient gate is an amazing experience. Many big tropical trees are fruiting in June and many flowers are blooming. This nature trail is really worth my time.
,,Fort Canning Park - What a surprise!,4.0,,"This attraction is the least any tourists would look into. I, too, stumbled upon this place while looking out for a nearby MRT to reach home. It's a vast park, be prepared to give 2 hours to it to see her beauty, bask into her serenity and understand the history behind the place.

It's next to the Central Fire Station on Hill Street, hence the entrance is easily overlooked because of the big open space in front that looks more like a resting place. The steps were the ones that attracted me to probe further in, to find out what was actually on top. It was in the evening around 5.45pm. Sorry folks, no elevators, but vehicles could be driven right up to the Raffles House, which now is opened for private social function bookings.

Take your time to climb up the many steps; else you would be breathless by the time you reach the second level (by the way, there are so many entries/exits you have to discover which ones you like for re-visits).

The first lighthouse was built there and the importance of its presence to guide the seamen into and out of the ports, before the skyscrapers in front blocked the sea views. Sir Raffles built his house there. It was not so much of the history, but the landscaping of the rainforest trees that were really mesmerising. If only trees could speak....

Well, enough for disclosing this much, go for the discovery. This one is definitely for nature lovers, not shopaholics."
,,Nice Green Space,5.0,,"I didn't plan to visit fort canning Park while I stayed in Singapore. It was coincidence, I walked nowhere and found stairway to hill near by clarke quay. I took a step and walked there. I knew that the name of this place is fort canning later. The park is really green and we can find some historical site. It was nice afternoon walk and I could see Singapore down town as a background behind the tree. Cool place to sit and relax."
,,A breath of nature and history surrounded by city.,4.0,,"Had my morning walk at Fort Canning Park this Vesak public holiday.
I walked from Dorby Ghaut Mrt to Penang Road then to Clemenceau Ave which take around 10min. It is actually just behind of Park Mall.
Realised also that Fort Canning Park is also accessible from City Hall and Clarke Quay Mrt!
A very nice exposure for me with friends back to nature and the past.For me,it is different from other nature park with extra sense of historical background! A gem in the city!"
,,Nice step in the past,3.0,,It is a nice park which let you step in the past of the island. There is also a nice view from the top.
,,A nice public park with history,5.0,,"A little climb, yet the history, tranquillity and views of Singapore through the trees are well worth it."
,,Awesome Place to spend a day,5.0,,"Fort Canning park is a nicely landscaped place featuring walk paths through thick green gardens with a variety of botanical arrangements. It also features a WWII history museum called the Battle Box, which is a must watch. They have put mannequins from the company who does these for madame tussauds museum. They are placed in several WWII situations. We were lucky to have found a historian there who had a firm grasp of all those events and our visit turned out to be more fun and educative."
,,Wonderful example of Singapore's greenery,4.0,,"One of my favourite green spaces in Singapore is Fort Canning Park, which is located just behind Clarke Quay and Boat Quay on the Singapore River. Fort Canning was a fort during World War 2 and still remnants of the time remain for you to explore, including the Battle Box, which is an indoor history of the time period, although this is not free, it is nonetheless a good addition to the park.

I have never seen any monkeys at Fort Canning, either, which is a good thing! What you can see, however, are little reminders on the fencing that some of Fort Canning Park is off limits to the public, as some military exercises are still undertaken at the summit.

All in all, Fort Canning Park is a lovely green park through which to stroll for an hour or two. There are ample picnic areas, if you want to bring a snack or two, but remember to leave nothing behind. There is also a little snack bar at the foot of the park, but it is not always open. Be aware that there is nowhere safe to shelter from thunder and lightning at Fort Canning Park, as there are lots of high trees which can be a safety hazard, and although the park is not as big as say Bukit Timah or Mount Faber Park, you should still check the weather forecast before you go, just to be on the safe side."
,,A lovely compact park,4.0,,"Canning Park has the advantage of being easily reached and is blessed with a range of lovely views of parts of Singapore. Being in the tropics the lawns are truly lush and the plants overflowing with vitality.

What this park has that sets it a little apart from, say, the very impressive Botanical Gardens in the same city is that it has a range of points of historical interest. These range from parts of the old fort, to the large Canning Centre which is used for exhibits, to the 'Battle Box' which was the British HQ in World War 2 and also to exhibits of archaeological aspects of Singapore.

Furthermore if you are keen you can attack this early in the morning from the opposite side of the part to the National Museum and, after your stroll, enjoy the air conditioned amenities of aforesaid museum. In fact the truly keen could then move from there to the Singapore Art Museum and thence (if their brain isn't overloaded with facts by that point) to the Peranakan Museum.

Highly recommended."
,,relaxing stroll,2.0,,It was a nice walk through although be prepared to walk up alot of stairs. Would have been better if there wasnt so many attractions closed for maintenance.
,,Nice setting but horrible staff,2.0,,"We were really surprised at how small the rooms are. The ""star architect"" who designed the place should have known better to make ONE big room instead of two tiny ones, maybe then the bathtub would not have had to be on the balcony!
One more negative point was that the walls are not sound proof. You can hear everything your neighbors do and say and consider they can hear you too!

We were disappointed about the hotel management as well because we felt that guests were treated like a burden for the hotel staff. We were never greeted or even acknowledged, instead the receptionist was busy rolling his eyes at us whenever we asked about normal things like where the breakfast is located.

The sink in our room was badly damaged and we told the reception three times to fix it. But nothing was done during our 7 night stay.
It's a pity because this hotel has plenty to offer. Two big pools in a green sunny garden, a very good restaurant and the wonderful Fort Canning park which is a quiet oasis in the heart of the city at any time of the day.

If you like to walk you can reach big shopping malls, the Orchard road, Marina bay or Clarke Quay in 10 to 20 minutes by foot. In the late evening the hotel offers a sundowner with different types of wine for free in the lush garden. With a motivated staff it could be a good place especially in the beautiful setting.

So overall we cannot recommend this hotel considering the attitude and lack of motivation of the staff and management and the unpractical room layout."
,,Nothing overly interesting,3.0,,Nothing too interesting here in Fort Canning Park. There are some amazing trees which look like they would be hundreds of years old - it would have been great to have some information on them because they were very impressive! There is a lot of shade in this park and we also saw a few runners. Nice varied terrain for a run.
,,garden above the city,4.0,,"Basically above the city this garden is another place to escape the city. Like botanical garden and the southern ridges. Don't expect any exotic plants. It's more like a quiet place to hang out.
On the northern side of the park, behind the National Museum of Singapore there is a escalator to go up to the gardens."
,,Great garden,4.0,,They have lots of shades so it is not so hot. There is also a spice garden where you can see some tropical spices in South East Asia. I had a run in this park and it was so pleasant!
,,"Trees, Tradition and Tranquility",5.0,,"I will never look at trees the same way again. Not after touring with Yap and Teck Seng, both volunteer guides, through Fort Canning. Besides talking about the history of the park (former residence of Malayan Kings, the Forbidden Hill, British stronghold, Botanical Garden, etc.), they also brought to life the true spectacles of the park: the giant trees, flowers and plants that have played witness to the park's history.

Their passion, knowledge and enthusiasm about the park, its history, and the beautiful grounds is absolutely mesmerizing. I can't think of any other way to describe it. One can't help but be drawn in by their stories.

Fort Canning is one of the highest points in Singapore. From atop the park, you have a bird's eye view of Clark Quay and the city skyline. It‚Äôs incredibly convenient to get to via Dhoby Gaut MRT or Bra Basah MRT. Based on one of the guest‚Äôs comments, public transport is probably easier as he had difficulty finding nearby parking.

My tour highlights include:
- Fort Canning Gate - try opening/closing it by yourself. It is HEAVY!
- Heritage Trees
- Keramat Iskandar Sha
- Sir Raffles former home
- The reservoir
- Learning about how figs get propagated (absolutely fascinating)
- The archaeological dig

A few tips:
- Plan to visit for at least hours
- Sign up for one of the FREE Saturday afternoon tours on the park's website: http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/index.php?option=com_visitorsguide&task=parks&id=16&Itemid=75
- Bring a bottle of water (there are no water fountains around)
- Bring mosquito repellent

I hope that when you schedule your tour, you also have the pleasure of touring with Yap and Teck Seng.

By the way, did I mention the tour is FREE?"
,,Splendid View of Singapore from Fort Canning Park,4.0,,"You can start your tour of Fort Canning Park via the National Museum pathway entrance or at this location from Hill Street - entrance is next the Ministry of Communication (former Hill Street Police Station building)...it will bring you up to the Raffles Terrace. I recommend you start the walking tour at the National Museum because there is an outdoor escalator that will bring you to the top of Fort Canning...it's located at the left side as you approached the Museum building.

Discovering Fort Canning Park Attractions - covers the Fort Gate, The Battle Box, Fort Canning Historical Sites includes the Keramat - Sultan Iskandar, Spice Garden, Raffles House and Raffles Terrace. A unique view of Singapore from Raffles Terrace - a grand view of downtown Singapore, the Marina Bay Sands Resort, the banking district buildings...Sir Stamford Raffles probably enjoyed the view so much in the British Colonial Days of 1800 that they build a bungalow for him at this hill top!"
,,Historical!,4.0,,"Beautifully kept grounds and gardens to wander through. Good historical plagues set up, but unfortunately the Battle Box was shut on the day we visited. Still - a lovely spot wo wander."
,,Central location,4.0,,"Large park and lots to see in that area. We for example went there after a visit in National Museum. Well maintained, like all parks in Singapore. Nice buildings and some historical sites too, like old grave stones for example"
,,"Peaceful, well kept",4.0,,"This is an excellent park for a walk. If you are visiting Singapore for the first time, go to the Singapore Botanic Garden first. If you have been in Singapore or visiting for a longer stay, this is an excellent place for an evening stroll.
The park is well-kept and there are interesting plants to see. You can walk around the park in a reasonable amount of time. There are other people around, but it is definitely not crowded.
It's simply a wonderful, peaceful place for a nice walk."
,,Park with a history,4.0,,"The many parks in Singapore are all well kept. Canning park add some history to that with some relics from another era. Though there's not so much left from the fort, you still can get an impression. The park lies on a small mountain, and has a fence around the top part. I haven't found out why. An officer told me tere was a reservoir...
Besides this, beautiful trees, one of them with hugh aireal roots hanging downwards, are all around."
,,Nice place for a walk,4.0,,"Enjoyed a lovely couple of hours strolling around, watching the squirrels and enjoying the herb garden. Take plenty water though, there are no shops nearby and when the heat and humidity take their toll, you'll need it. I looked like I'd been thrown in a swimming pool by the end of it. Oh, and it's steep in lots of places."
,,Tranquil,5.0,,A lovely place to have an early morning walk through the park. Lots of locals doing Tai Chi in the park.
,,Easy Access from Orchard Road,4.0,,"Fort Canning park is easily accessible by steps from Orchard Road.
There are convenient steps behind the National Museum.
The Battle Box is worth a visit to get an idea of the last days of British Imperial rule.
Taxi's go to the Battle Box visitors centre if you do want to use the stairs."
,,good place for picnic,4.0,,"It is a quiet park, suitable for picnic and a casual walk. A cooking school is also nearby, where you may drop a visit."
,,The Long Bar at the Raffles Hotel and History of WW11 at the Battle Box,5.0,,"It is obligatory for me, when I come to Singapore, to go to The Raffles for a Singapore Sling in The Long Bar. The Singapore Sling was created by bartender, Ngiam Tong Boon at The Raffles Hotel in 1915. He used fresh lime juice, pineapple juice, Benedictine, Orange Liqueur, Grenadine Syrup, Angostura Bitters, Gin and Cherry Brandy to ""knock your socks off"".

It is an amazing experience, steeped in so much history. From there I make my way to Fort Canning Park. I've been to Fort Canning Park on four separate visits to Singapore. I toured the Battle Box each time as I found the history of this place fascinating. There are 26 rooms in The Battle Box which re-enacts the final days of the takeover of Singapore. The Battle Box has specially crafted wax figures, some of which can move and talk using animatronics. I found the re-creation scenes extremely emotional and you can get a sense of what it must have been like for the soldiers who served there. Apparently the Battle Box is closed for renovation but if you get the chance when you go to Singapore and it is open, you must go to the Battle Box to experience this fantastic exhibit.

Fort Canning Park is well maintained and Fort Canning Centre shows life in another era. Gattopardo Italian Grill & Pizza Bar serves fine food and on another occasion, the Indian Restaurant located at the rear of the Old Married Soldier's Quarters served exceptional food at cheap prices."
,,Big humidity but amazing,4.0,,"Humidity was very high, you will be sweaty in one minute, but it is amazing. In the middle of the city, a real beautiful park was preserved, where you can find several nice trees, flowers, birds and some excavations also. You have to spend approx one hour here, worth of it."
,,One of Singapore's secrets- near the National Museum; accessible from Dhoby Ghaut MRT station,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a peaceful area- ideal for a stroll as part of a day trip.

It's near to other attractions: principally the National a Museum of Singapore, which is an excellent place to visit, with two good places to eat.

There is signage within the Park to guide you to places of interest. Also, there is a hotel within the Park area.

I found it particularly interesting on this visit to look at a wall of burial sites- part of the interesting history of Singapore.

I suggest that if you are visiting attractions in the area, you make the additional time to take a walk through the Park."
,,"Dilapidated buildings, nice flora though",3.0,,"When you visit this place, you can expect to see some old fort gates, Raffles' House, Old Married Soldiers' Quarters and the Fort Canning Centre - an old barrack of the British Army in Singapore, all very run-down. They are for special events on bookings. Visitors or members of the public can visit any time though, take a look inside these buildings, they are empty. If the place is filled with people some events must be on-going, e.g. weddings (due to the registry of marriages next door). The place is also popular with students (from a nearby university) and people going there for picnics. Before visit, download a map of the park, plan at least 1 hour strolling through the park. Park is open 24 hours, but night time strolling is not recommended, pathways are very dark and dangerous. Other attractions include the archaeological dig exhibitions, Spice Garden, Cupolas, Battle Box, 2 9-pound cannons, a replica lighthouse, ASEAN Sculpture Garden and a Sally Port."
,,Close to the city,3.0,,"Visited the Park after a morning in the National Musuem, it is a sea of calm. I was hoping to visit the Battle Box but it was closed and apparantly has been for quite a while. There is quite a bit of work ongoing hopefully completed soon. It is an enjoyable walk through the park and it does take you down to Clarke Quay."
,,disappointing,2.0,,After walking from the local MRT station I was disappointed to find that the battle box is closed indefinitely and that there isn't really much else to do there. I wandered around the grounds for a little while in an aimless fashion eventually finding my way out! On the plus side it is next to the national museum which is definitely worth a visit and there are some nice photo opportunities if you are that way inclined!!!
,,"Beautiful place but full of construction, with poor info about how to avoid it.",3.0,,"Poor info generally in the park, as well as a lack of food and drink. Battle Box closed too with little info provided. Fort Canning Centre is grubby, with poor lighting and expensive exhibits. Spice garden is nice though."
,,Lovely green way to get from hotel to Orchard Rd shopping.,4.0,,Pretty walk through historic location Respite from heat and bustle of busy city. Read about the history of the city. Beautiful trees and well kept grass with seating to enjoy the cool breeze.
,,Stunning Grounds,5.0,,I had a wonderful time wondering through Fort Canning Park. There is a lot of history to read about and a few artifacts to see. The gardens are superbly maintained and some of the trees have to be at least 150 years old. A great photography playground. I came across a local in the Spice Garden who happily shared his knowledge about the many herbs and spices used in traditional cooking. It's close to the centre of town so very easy access.
,,Ballet on the grass,4.0,,We went for a performance on a Saturday evening with a picnic hamper and had a delightful time.The performance itself was outstanding and was further enhanced by the setting and the freedom to lounge on the grassy slopes partaking of some delicious fruit and snacks.
,,Lack of up to date information on website,2.0,,After checking website was very disappointed to commute to Fort Canning to find the venue closed and especially a note at the Battle Box door advising that it would be CLOSED INDEFINITELY.
,,Runners' and Walkers' paradise,3.0,,"Approaching Fort Canning Park from the marina area you will see a very odd site - a lighthouse buried in green foliage and creepers. It used to be the 'welcome' place for foreigners entering Singapore hence I guess the lighthouse. Fort Canning is just south off Orchard Road. It's literally a high point of a trip to Singapore. More hustle and bustle than the Singapore Botanical gardens but impressive because of its height and historical significance.
If you need a workout this is the place for a run or a brisk walk. Up hill and down dale.
If you are fighting the shopaholics then you might be able to drag them into Fort Canning Park as its so close to Orchard Road shops - you can see the shops, I'm sure from the park. Casual walking and site-seeing abound.
There's also a hotel in the park. Worth a look around and maybe it's a place to stay next time, being part of an oasis in shoppers heaven. There are two pools that seem little used so take the plunge."
,,Very Nice Park,4.0,,This oasis in the middle of Singapore near both Orchard Rd. and the CDB is worth a stroll if you want to surround yourself with some green space for a while. There is also a very well done WWI museum in the park that recounts the war as it affected Singapore. There are several paths in the park and it would be worth spending an hour our so if you want to escape the urban scenery for a little while.
,,A park and a historical site in one,4.0,,"I took a quick early evening run from YMCA to Fort Canning and ended up staying for hours.

Fort Canning, located at a hill which used to house defenses for the 'old' Singapura is a free park and historical site in one. It's a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of commercial Singapore and you could spend hours jogging and enjoying the flowers, trees and birds.

The views of the city from Fort Canning are spectacular. There are historical markers which offer visitors a glimpse of Singapore's past.

I particularly enjoyed the old cemetery with the lovely open area used for performances.

Highly recommended!"
,,A pleasant walk with glimpses into Singapore's history,4.0,,"There are several entrances to this Park - I took the escalator next to the National Museum. I then followed the signs through the Spice Garden and the archaeological dig to the Fort Canning Centre - not much was happening here (it would be a nice location for a coffee shop) but I was able to pick up a map of the Park which assisted my exploration of the area and my understanding of what I was seeing.
The map suggests three self guided walks - heritage trees, Singapore's Ancient History and Singapore's's Colonial History. By circling the top of the hill and descending via Raffles House, the Flagstaff, the Lighthouse and the Mural Wall, I saw most of the sights. From Raffles Terrace there is a great view towards the Marina Bay area. I was disappointed that the Battle Box was closed (indefinitely and without explanation, if I remember correctly). I stopped for a morning coffee at the Glass House Cafe in Hotel Fort Canning."
,,Besides a walk down memory lane...there is nothing much here.,3.0,,"Good: -This place is part of Singapore's colonial history, which Sir Stamford Raffles did as part of his city planning. -Many famous people have their graves, scattered around the premise. -Still in its original condition. Bad: -Mosquitos are present. -No eateries. -Hot weather."
,,Fort Canning Park,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is the oldest park in the heart of the city. Some early artifacts like porcelain bowls have been discovered here and they date back to the 18th century. FCP is an ideal park and is the favourite haunt of young lovers who congregate here in the evening. You can find coffee trees and also the tree called the Tongkat Ali or Eurycoma longifolia whose bark is used as an aphrodisiac. Nutmeg trees are also found here. There is also an old English cemetery as in the early days, many mariners who died here were buried by their next of kin. You can see my video on You Tube under the website:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkFiSOgt-g"
,,Place for a leisure stroll,4.0,,"The fort, as such does not have anything to offer. The place around the fort is good for a leisure walk in the evening. And you can continue the walk and end at Clarke Quay to unwind in the night"
,,battlebox closed for renovations,2.0,,went here for last few hours before leaving for the airport with the main purpose to look around the battlebox museum. finally found it with a notice on the door saying closed for renovations. our concierge had looked up the website the night before to check the opening times and there was nothing on there to warn us. so disappointed.
,,Beautiful park for a romantic walk,4.0,,It is very peaceful and beautiful. You forget that it is located in the middle of a huge city. Nice for a romantic pick nick!
,,Historical!,4.0,,"What a beautiful preservation of whatever that is left of Singapore. Thank you Mr Government! Take a stroll, enjoy the quiet beauty or sign up for the battlebox tour. When you are tired, head down to the hotel for tea!"
,,A visit to Fort Canning Park,4.0,,"Visited Fort Canning Park last week. Unfortunately the WW 2, command bunkers was closed for maintenance works. Nevertheless, the historical feel of the park remains untouched like the old lighthouse, Fortress gateway, King's tomb and old grave stone memorial wall. These sites are well inscripted for visitor's information. Strolling around the spice garden, and birds watching are the other pleasure to enjoy and relax at the park."
,,A great historical park,4.0,,"Evaluated as a park alone, Fort Canning definitely can't beat some of the other beautiful green spaces in Singapore like the Botanical Gardens. The true value of Fort Canning is its historical significance. To get the most out of your visit, I recommend taking one of the free tours on Saturday, and also visiting the Battle Box bunker. If you can't take a free tour, make sure to pic up one of the free park maps in the Fort Canning Centre. The map outlines three different walking tours that you can take through the park."
,,Take a guided tour,4.0,,"I agree with a recent review that it will be extremely useful to take a Saturday guided tour to learn about the fauna (e.g. ginger plants, herbs, palms ...) or a historic tour provided free of charge by volunteers under a National Parks programme (check their web site for schedule). If not, it's easy to miss out on small details and stories behind a tombstone or artifact."
,,Tranquility in the city,4.0,,"We were walking from Chinatown to Orchard Road today and passed through Fort Canning Park. What a pleasant oasis of tranquility in the city: a great place to escape and relax for a bit. We were there at circa 3pm and the park was virtually deserted so we could hear the wildlife and nature very clearly. As well as being a pleasant stroll with some good views of the CBD, there are a number of historical non-nature things to look at such as the time ball, lighthouse, cannons etc. All these include small information boards to tell you a short history. Free entry and very pleasant so you can't complain."
,,On the way to Clark Quay!,4.0,,This is the closest quiet oasis to Clark Quay so good to cross the road for a little bit of peace and quiet.
,,Waste of time,1.0,,"I made the trip out to Fort Canning to visit the Battle Box....Upon arriving there was a note on the entrance saying ""closed until further notice"" Well done Fort Canning you could have put this on your website!! NOT EVEN SORRY ON YOUR NOTICE!!"
,,Beautiful park,5.0,,"For those who love nature, history and some peace, this is a place that you should go. Fort Canning park possesses many cultural and historical values besides a beautiful nature. A scent in the park that was so light and pure made me feel so refresh and calm. Even when I'm writing these words I can recall that experience"
,,average,3.0,,"The fort Canning park has alot of history to it but, I didn't find it that great. The park is a good place to walk around and its huge."
,,Full of emptiness,3.0,,"Expectations were high as we approached Fort Canning. They dropped as we found the park deserted, the Battle Box closed INDEFINITELY and a noisy ""Bloc Party"" band setting up.
There was a lot of potential there but I think either enthusiasm has waned or money is lacking.
It is a pity because it is full of history and the grounds are beautifully kept. The views are wonderful, there are birds and plants and an air of tranquility. Worth a peek to see the sights, but not a place I would return to unless the Battle Box is re-opened."
,,Time your visit with a free guided walk to enhance the experience,4.0,,"I went with my partner to Fort Canning and attended a free heritage guided walk on a Saturday morning and found it a highly informative and enjoyable way to work up an appetite for brunch!

There's actually many hidden treasures around Fort Canning including remnants of a cemetary, a archaelogical dig, a spice garden and a fort gate. I don't think the Fort Canning experience would have been the same without a guided tour which is why other reviewers have found it disappointing.

The National Parks Board appears to run free guided tours from 4 - 5.30pm on Saturdays <http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/images/stories/guided-walks.html>. My tip is to bring mosquito repellant and wear long pants as I was nearly eaten alive at the dig!

,,Quiet oasis and very historic,4.0,,"We spent a quiet afternoon exploring this area. At time of writing the Battle Box was still closed. Aside from this, the gardens are relaxing. The graves are particularly interesting, dating back to the mid 1800s. Definitely worth a look."
,,dissapointing,3.0,,went up to look at this site to discover that the battlebox was closed. the entire canning centre was empty rooms. only one display and that was of a rikshaw. did see an archelogical dig and some other building which was beingused for a meeting. dont bother unless you want to get away from the traffic.
,,Lovely Park with Historical Features,3.0,,"There is easy parking and a short stroll up the hill to the old fort. The gardens are leafy and shaded by huge, ferny trees. We paid to visit the Battery Box which was the underground HQ of the British and Allied Forces in WWII. It is a moving experience being in the actual rooms and hearing transcripts of the surrender of Singapore in 1942. This small underground museum has been lovingly restored and feels totally authentic. The guided tour was well presented and fascinating. It is air-conditioned now and an interesting and cool refuge on a hot day. We enjoyed our visit, but I wished that there was water available in the vending machines instead of just sugary and fizzy drinks. Also there should be more books available for those who would like to research the fall of Singapore more thoroughly. On the whole is was a pleasant way to while away a hot afternoon."
,,Nice stroll,4.0,,"Nice for a quiet walk, can be slippery in places and sometime steep, easy access from several MRTs and the city. Not much to do here except for the underground bunker."
,,grave on the wall,4.0,,"I never knew that this place was cemetery, and was nice with old grave and big tree. Awesome, nice for taking a photo session."
,,Wonderful Experience,5.0,,The park is Superb and we can say it as Garden. Most of the Trees have the description and maintenance of the Park is very well. I have enjoyed the Park a lot. Park is too large and it is almost connected to 2 MRTs and several main roads. It will take entire day to cover the park completely. Also it is picnic spot. The terraces are very good and you can enjoy well. Free drinking water (thru taps) facility is available in the Park.
,,Fort Canning Park,4.0,,It is very hilly but pretty and quiet. There are nice walking trails which all lead up to the top where the old fort is. I didn't go into anything but the park itself if very nice.
,,Interesting glimpse into history,4.0,,"Not all that easy to find - located behind Fort Canning with the ticket office housed in a tiny white building. The Battle Box is filled with models, maps and recreations of life as it must have been 65 years ago. I enjoyed it - the people who opted for the guided tour looked less enthused. I guess it's the kind if place you may want to explore at your own pace."
,,Battle Box....,4.0,,Fine Park to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Visited the Battle Box which is worth a visit if you are interested in military history .
,,Singapore History,4.0,,"Tucked behind Clarke Quay, Fort Canning has several spots to visit the history of the fall of British held Singapore to the Japanese."
,,Hidden Gem,4.0,,"We happened across the park as we were walking through the city, and we are so glad we found it. Beautiful park, with some nice walking paths that are excellently maintained as well."
,,Historical journey to the past,5.0,,The place has a really peaceful atmosphere. The dugout was cool too. Very educational and suitable for all ages.
,,beautiful park right next to clarke quay,4.0,,"while the walk is a little up hill, it gives a magificanet view over the singapore river and the city. pleasant in the evenings and really worth a look."
,,Serene Oasis in the middle of the city,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park has a great atmosphere for picnic, watching concert and hold a wedding. You can also go for a walk with your loved ones or go jogging."
,,Great War Museum,4.0,,The animatronics at this museum are great and give you a real feel for the final days before the Japanese invasion on Singapore. Beautiful park like setting and the restaurant on site is one not to be missed.
,,Peaceful and interesting,5.0,,"We stumbled across Fort Canning Park one morning when going for a walk. The kids loved exploring all the walkways and there were plenty of photo opportunities. The gardens are lush and the park has a very peaceful quality. The history of the place is intriguing for the adults and the huge gate is fascinating for little boys! The Battlebox is also a place of huge interest.

There are a LOT of stairs so it isn't suitable for prams, the elderly or young children who want to be carried a lot.

Although this was an unplanned part of our visit it was one of the most enjoyable mornings we had. Just do it early in the day before the heat sets in."
,,The Battle Box,4.0,,We spend half a day there walking to climb the hill and looking around. Spend several hours inside the tunnels dug out before WW11. This was where the decision to surrender to Japanese was made.
,,Shakespeare in the Garden,4.0,,"Check out, if there is a festival or concert. Very nice place to spend some time and walk around in the garden."
,,Interesting escape from the city,4.0,,"This is easy to get to and right in the city. The traffic noise can still be heard but it is at a distance and the green, leafy spaces are a welcome relief. There are interesting things to see - old gravestones from sailors and early settlers of Singapore, archaeological finds, the old gate of the fort, a spice garden and Raffles' bungalow among others. The best part was the Battle Box, which charges a small fee. You won't find any refreshments unless you want to pay large amounts for them at the Fort Canning Hotel, but it would be a lovely place for a picnic as there are plenty of places to sit. There weren't crowds of people there, either."
,,great place to see a concert,3.0,,"in general, i give an average rating - i enjoy running around the park, but it's not extraordinary, however, seeing a concert here is fantastic! eclx"
,,Fort Canning Park,4.0,,Found Fort Canning Park a short walk from Robertson Walk. The park can be accessed by car or bus. Very well maintained and full of history of Singapore
,,A nice morning walk,4.0,,"The Park was a 5 minute stroll from our Hotel, although it took a little longer to walk up all the steps from the road! It was a lovely way to spend a couple of hours walking around."
,,A gorgeous park.,4.0,,"This is a wonderful park to enjoy a 2-hour stroll.
While the entrance to the park starts with many, many, MANY stairs, it is well worth to get to the upper part of the park, where you can enjoy beautiful jungle-like trees, lovely flowers and even some historic buildings.
The view from the park is lovely and the trees contrast beautifully with the tall buildings surrounding the park.
You can take a circular path around the water reservoir. Just make sure not to get too close to the fence of the water reservoir. As the sign suggests - those guys are SERIOUS!
Despite visiting the park in the late morning/early noon on a hot July day, the stroll in the park was rather effortless most of the time and is suitable for everyone (as long as you can handle the numerous stairs on the entrance).
Highly recommended!"
,,Pleasant park gets an extra star mainly for the Battle Box,4.0,,"It's a pleasant walk through the grounds of this park on a hill, but what remains of the fort is quite limited if well-illustrated on the two trails around the park.

Highlight is really the Battle Box: a guided tour takes you through re-enactments of the one-sided Japanese invasion and the subsequent sad British surrender undertaken to avoid an even worse bloodbath."
,,Picnicking Haven,5.0,,"Wonderful environment with lots of special herbal plants and trees!
But the best thing about this place is the clean and even grass land in front of the stage where you may have casual picnics or enjoy outdoor performances with prepared feasts when coming with friends and family."
,,Great place to go for a walk,4.0,,"It only takes about an hour to walk to entire trail, but there's always something interesting happening at the park. Really like to come on the weekend and mellow for a while."
,,Peaceful...until the night of the rock concerts,4.0,,"I attended school near Fort Canning Park over 25 years ago and till today, still know it as a peaceful respite from the bustle of Bras Basah and Orchard Roads. With some funerary architecture dating back to the 1800s and an ongoing archeological dig still going on at certain times of the year, it's steeped in local historical importance. The presence of the National Museum of Singapore at the foot of Fort Canning hill also lends a certain degree of culture and sophistication to the surroundings.

These days, modernisation is leaning in and the park plays the role of concert venue under the stars. Ranging from classical to rock, as well as plays and shows, it's a terrific place for the concert goer as well as the family."
,,Lovely Historical Park,4.0,,"Lush and tropical the old fort still has relics like the battle box, cannon, as well as lovely tress and flora. You can easily stroll around the park and it was quite relaxing. Bring your walking shoes. It is off the beaten track so you tend to walk there and back as less linking transport."
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"A lovely oasis of calm in the heart of the city, just behind Clarke Quay. Some interesting historical insights into early Singapore.
Would have given it a higher score oif the Battle Box had been open at 11:45 when oit was supposed to be , instead of closed for lunch 15 mins early"
,,Hidden treasure,4.0,,"Hidden behind the National Museum - great place to visit for all. There is a spice garden for those interested in plants. Don't forget to look for the ""Cannonball Tree"" in the main courtyard near the remnants of the Fort Gate. There is an archaeological dig site as well as the last Malay King's tomb. Kids will enjoy the cannon, the Fort Gate (you can climb up) as well as a Sally Port to sneak out.

There are several art installations around as well weddings on the weekends."
,,Wonderful evening under the stars,5.0,,"My husband and I have attended two events at Fort Canning Park - the ballet under the stars and also a Shakespearean play. Both were wonderful. The park opens up a couple hours before the events start, and people throw blankets down on the grass, bring food and drinks and essentially have a picnic before and during the shows. Both times we've had a wonderful time. One word of caution, however. Make sure you have transport arranged back to your hotel. Getting a taxi from there is quite tricky if you aren't from Singapore. You end up having to walk a ways to find an actual taxi stand, and it can be a little confusing."
,,"2 Historical Trails - Ancient Singapore Trail, Or Colonial Singapore Trail",3.0,,"Fort Canning Park & Battle Box is one of Singapore's oldest parks, and also one of the earliest seats of government during the colonial days. The Battle Box is actually a museum located within Fort Canning Park. Getting around is relatively easy, however, there are 2 different trails you could take to explore the place.

The more popular trail is the Colonial Singapore Trail, as you'll get to see most of the remaining artifacts and architecture within Fort Canning Park & Battle Box. This trail features highlights like 2 9 Pound Cannons, the Gothic Gates, the Light House, Time Ball, Fort Gate, Sally Port, and of course, the Battle Box museum.

In contrast, the Fort Canning Park & Battle Box trail called the Ancient Singapore Trail features more storyboards rather than exhibits. The highlights here include the Keramat and Mural Walls.

Because of these 2 different trails, exploring Fort Canning Park & Battle Box over 2 short visits, rather than 1 long visit, is an option. Furthermore, exploring the Battle Box museum will take some time as well.

Located at Cox Terrace in Fort Canning Park, the Battle Box museum is a restored underground bunker. Though small, they've managed to fill the place quite well with various exhibits, and it is well worth a look.

If you're planning a visit, do note that while Fort Canning Park is free, the admission to Battle Box costs $5. Allocate between 1 to 4 hours for viewing, and bring water along."
,,Great 1/2 day,5.0,,A nice quiet place to spend a few hours. The relics there and history make for an interesting visit. The gardens are well laid out and very pretty.
,,Unusual,4.0,,It was an unusual setting for a wedding dinner. The dinner was set under a huge tent. However we enjoyed the dinner and the service.
,,The silence is deafening walking in Fort Canning Park,5.0,,"Fort Canning Park
Fort Canning Park is actually a cultural as well a heritage master piece. You will be led past the most historic part of Singapore. Malay and Chinese historical records point to this hill as the centre of a kingdom that arose around 1300 AD. You‚Äôll see The Keramat Iskandar Syah, which means a sacred place in Malay, ‚ÄúKeremat‚Äù is a tradiotional burial ground. You‚Äôll see an Archaeological Excavation site, the ‚ÄúParit Singapora‚Äù, ancient Malay and Chinese sources mention that Singapore had a ‚Äúmoat and wall‚Äù. The western wall shows you breath-taking views of the ‚ÄúSingapore River. Last but not least you‚Äôll walk to the ‚ÄúReservoir‚Äù, a natural spring site which fed the ‚ÄúPancur Larangan‚Äù a bathing place reserved for 14th century Malay royalty. The breath-taking old trees, adorned with majestic ferns is something together with the silence makes this walk very special. You need to come the next day though, because Fort Canning Park has another very special treasure, The Battle Box. An absolutely stunningly restored takes you right into the British H.Q Malaysia Command. Take your time for both. Both ‚Äúattractions‚Äù are suitable for seniors. For The Battle Box children need to be a bit older then the age of 6."
,,Relaxing Walk and Reading Place,4.0,,"The place is serene and perfect ambiance for picnic mat and good book. However, I went on Sunday and though its NOT that crowded, there are few people who could potentially disturb you by their actions. Like couples who are very intimate etc. Since it is Sunday, its off day for most household workers so they add to the park's visitor population. I think Saturday morning or late afternoon is the best time to unwind. I'll definitely try it again on another day."
,,Great way to people watch the locals,4.0,,"I enjoyed the park and walking around, learning about the history and seeing the cannons, although l think my favourite part was people watching the locals. As the population is quite large for a small place this park appears to be a romantic destination for couples and families.
The nature was great alongside weddings and family events."
,,Modern sculpture,4.0,,"That might not be what you expect in this green oasis, testament to the colonial heritage. Personally, I am not a great sculpture devotee but I was impressed. It really is possible to see, I think, what the artist was intending with some of these works. If you are attending a conference at Hotel Fort Canning, as I was, it is essential to make time to view the park as it really is on the "" doorstep""."
,,Nature and Fresh Air,4.0,,"It is right opposite to YWCA Fort Canning Lodge. We liked the variety of trees, walk amidst spice garden, heritage walk intermixed with he history related to WW-II in form of Battle Box also located in the same area.
Excellent place to recharge the energy after exhaustive shopping trips."
,,beautiful park in the city,4.0,,"one I like about Singapore beside the cleaneliness, there are so many beautifull parks inside the city. Fort canning hill one of the parks. We through the park from National Museum to go the Clarke Quay. very nice walking tour inside the park."
,,Fort Channing ‚Äì Battle Box great,5.0,,"A must see the battle box, it is located near the Fort Channing Hotel very well laid out and interesting,
We walked from The Park Hotel Clarke Quay and started at north end the battle box here after walked through the park and saw more of the highlights. There is lots of shade. We at end went to China Town. There is MRT located at South end."
,,A great late afternoon walk through Singapore's colonial history,4.0,,"The location, the explanatory signboards, the greenery, landscape and history combined. Raffles' bungalow, the lighthouse and modern SIngapore views. Spend an hour or so there late afternoon and then head down to Boat Quay for a drink and a bite to eat!"
,,A nice stroll,4.0,,It's a nice change from the city scene. A bit of history and pretty surroundings. Many outdoor concerts are held here. There is a beautiful view from the government house building.
,,Beautiful tropical oasis,5.0,,"A beautiful tropical oasis in the center of Singapore. Many magnificent trees and peaceful grassed areas. Also contains the Battle Box, a fascinating museum made from the British war-time command bunker, reminiscent of the Cabinet War rooms in London and one of the best-kept secrets of Singapore."
,,Great green escape in the city,4.0,,"Close from Orchard's shopping rows, and it provides a soothing spot for you to relax or do light exercises. The change from seeing buildings to seeing all green is ecstatic!"
,,Beautiful gardens,4.0,,The day we visited it was absolutely bucketing down. We kept going up the paths which were well sign posted to the Fort Canning Museum. The gardens are impressive with plants labelled and very well cared for. Tis a little hilly and with lots of steps to climb proved a challenge with all the water tumbling down. The Museum itself was impressive but suggest a visit when there is a tour guide to give more information.
,,Break away from city,5.0,,"Fort Canning is a huge park, by Singapore's standards. Weddings, photoshoots, and music concerts are held frequently in Fort Canning because of the scenic greenery and nice architecture. There are some stairs and slopes so wear comfortable attire and footwear is smart choice. Right beside the park is the Singapore National Museum, which is a great place to visit as well. Fort Canning Park is also next to the bustling town area of shopping malls, which makes it an amazing getaway from the busy city."
,,A greatly underestimated park,4.0,,"This is a great place to go for a walk or run right in the heart of the city. If you are feeling like some rather cliched 'eductainment', visit the Battle Box which is in the park. Otherwise, learn about the history & culture of the area for free (there is a small archaeological site, a keramat & spice walk). Go in the early evening."
,,Forest in the City,4.0,,"Fort Canning is definitely one of my favourite places in Singapore. The park complex is very versatile - has sculptures, a ""fort"", spices, and various beautiful plants. The greenery is lush, and makes for a wonderful walk."
,,great learning about Singapore history,5.0,,"great surrounding and interesting history, what else ?"
,,Beautiful park steeped in history,4.0,,A lovely park with beautiful views. A perfect spot to retreat from the bustle of city life. Worth stopping in at the Battle Box for a short but informative tour of the history of Singapore during World War 2.
,,Amazing little walk,4.0,,I stumbled across the park on a morning walk and it was beautiful. A very well kept place (like everything in Singapore) and some great historical information explaining how the park had been used in the past including the lighthouse which was once visible from the water but is now blocked by the many buildings. Very interesting and worth a walk through.
,,Good for a gentle stroll,4.0,,"We were staying at the Somerset Liang Court (serviced apartments) across the road and so it was easy to hop across on the pedestrian bridge. Pleasant surprise - good for an hour or so's gentle stroll if you need a break from eating and shopping! Historical bits and pieces, well-marked and signposted. Good low-key enjoyment - not for the adrenalin junkie!"
,,Running at Fort Channing Park,5.0,,"We stayed very close to Fort Channing Park and as a runner it was a great choice. The shaded tracks at the park made for very pleasant running, elevated above the streets of Singapore so away from car fumes and benefiting from views across Singapore. I didn't measure it but the main path circling close to the perimeter of the park but it is about 1.5 to 2.0 km long, and includes some steps and up and down grades. If you leave the Park at the bungee attraction (which is just across the road, down the steps from the hotel in the park), you can join the developed path along the river where you can run uninterrupted (to the left) down to the Marina Bay Area which also has a continuous path around it, then back along the river to explore Clarke Quay. Good stuff but try to do it before breakfast or before a late dinner, due to the heat!"
,,an interesting and worthwhile tour,4.0,,"If you've been to the War Rooms in London, and liked that, you'll also like the tour at Fort Canning. A very interesting and fairly objective view of the history of the defense of Singapore and of its surrender to the Japanese in World War II."
,,Nothing much to do,2.0,,"Besides from looking at gravestones, there's nothing much to see or do at the park. Come here when there are performances"
,,Green quiet amidst the busy city,4.0,,Quiet and peaceful garden on a hill amidst the hustle and bustle of Singapore City
,,History and greenery well-mixed,4.0,,"Steeped in history, this makes a quiet leafy getaway in the middle of the city. Can get a bit eerie with the quiet, especially on weekdays."
,,Good for photo-shoots but that's it.,2.0,,The refurbished Fort Canning still has that colonial feel and the Park is a favourite for wedding photo-shoots. Ok if you are a photography buff but not much else for me.
,,Nice Park in the Center of Singapore,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a nice green quiet area between Orchard Road and Clark Quay. There are some interesting historical land marks such as Raffles former bungalow and for history buffs, the battle box sre points of interest. This is where the decision was made by the British to surrender to the invading Imperial Japanese army. The park also features some spice gardens on the side towards the ministry of marriage. The park is free, but the battle box has a small fee."
,,A good run in central Singapore,4.0,,"Fort Canning is a good place for many things. I go there three times a week to run, but there are historical buiildings, gardens, wonderful trees, sometimes markets and sometimes outdoor concerts to experience here."
,,Lovely park in a central location,5.0,,"A great place, cool and quiet and very beautiful trees and plants. Nice walking paths and much history of area to be viewed."
,,Fascinating history of WW2,5.0,,Beautiful park in the middle of the city. Great escape from the heat and the hustle and bustle of the city. You have to take the tour of the Battle Box. You go into the bunkers down below and learn about the surrender of the British to the Japaneese in WW2. Really well done. They have wax figurines of all the major military players...really lifelike and kinda creepy! Check it out.
,,Lovely park in the middle of Singapore,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is a rather built up zone, with a river running through the middle, so it's surprising that only one road away you can be in a leafy park, full of shaded walks under the trees.

I came here very early in the morning for a run; there's some steep (and rather slippery) steps that take you to the top of the hill (not a big hill by any measure, but big enough for Singapore) and then a series of paths that follow the contours of the hill and allow you to gently spiral upwards. Then you can run back down the hill again. Thus it's good for joggers.

It's probably not good for the unsteady of foot, or those trying to propel a small child in a buggy, because of the steep and slimy steps. Although I suppose you could get a taxi to near the top and then walk around - which would be slightly more expensive, but still a pleasant way to find an oasis from all the concrete of central Singapore."
,,Slippery steps,4.0,,"Make sure you wear good shoes , the steps are so slippery if they have any water on them. The gardens are so beautiful, perfect spot to take some time out from the city."
,,Cool place,4.0,,Awesome if you go for a walk. Tough to believe that in teh heart of the concrete jungle you could find something like this.
,,The exiting history about the British Army surrender to Japan during World War 2,5.0,,"Visiting the Underground Far East Command Center for the British Army The Battle Box, and walk 9 m under the the ground in Fort Canning, is very exiting, and gives the visitors a lot to think about, when comming back to the ground again.

You see and hear the British Generals discoussing around the table, if and when they have to surrender to the Japanese during the worst situation for the British Army in Worls War 2. in Asia.

Fort Canning was the hearquarter of its defence bases in 1920 to protect British interrest in South East Asia, and the visitors feel the atmosphere during the tour 9 m. below the earth and see the big table build with landscape for Singapore surroundings, where the British Generals could make there plan for defence of there interrest in Asia.

This tour can be recomended for all visitors who want to know more about the background and history of Singapore."
,,Shady walk thru History,5.0,,It is hard to get a room in the lodge on the grounds but is is worth the wait!
,,Hideaway park right in the middle of the city,5.0,,"There are lots of history on top of this little hill, it was once known as the Forbidden Hill. There is the old fortress Gate, the site where Raffles house was suppose to have been there. World War 11 battle box is here. Lots to see and do here"
,,Old buildings and great surrounds,4.0,,"Many archeological digs at this place. Apparently the history stretches back to pre-Raffles Singapore. Apart from the history, a very nice park to visit and right in the middle of the business district."
,,Great walking trail at dawn,3.0,,"Place is just right behind the National Museum. The usual park with lots of grass and trees but offers a different ambiance. Nothing much to see but if you wanna be one with nature, then this is the place to be."
,,Nothing much,3.0,,Just a park in the middle of the cbd. Nothing much...
,,Old Governor House,4.0,,Personally I'd prefer the old rustic version before the renovation. But the National Parks Board did a very good job at restoring parts of the place. The old WWII tunnels are great history tellers if you are travelling there with the young ones. Roam around there in the middle of the night and you may get a chance to say hi to some of the war veterens too. :D
,,A quaint place to find out about World War II,4.0,,Fort Canning Park is a quiet place for tourists to take a stroll or read a book in. There are also monuments around the park in commemoration of World War II for tourists who are history buffs.
,,Lovely experience all round,5.0,,"The park is close to major hotels and we walked there in early morning and it was so nice. The historical value is excellent, the Bunker is so well presented and very informative. I thought I new a bit about Singapore in WW2 but after this visit i have more info to research. The children where so interested and could find something to look at and read around every corner.

The gardens and walks are well worth the visit, it is so well organised and very well kept it makes for a great half day or couple of hours.

There is a visitor centre but it was closed the day we went (new year holiday)."
,,Visit the bunker!,5.0,,"Ths review is really about the bunker - the park itself seemed nothing special to us! However, the bunker tour is good fun and appealed to all our group whose ages ranged from 20 - 50. Very interesting and worth a visit!"
,,History around every corner,4.0,,Takes you back 50 years in time to Gen Perceival and his defence of Singapore
,,park in the city,4.0,,Some great views and a nice place to relax in the city.
,,Beautiful and quiet,5.0,,"Beautiful forest, very nice view. A fresh oasis in the city."
,,Nice walking and views,4.0,,"Great to have a park like this in the middle of the city. I went a couple of times to have a look at its wildlife and plants (shrikes, fly over eagles, lizards etc) but it was a really nice little get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Some interesting history here too."
,,A must see,4.0,,Fort Canning Park in Sigapore has much more than its greenery. It has histoircal significance because of the buildings inside the park and World War II era under ground bunker which was the command centre of British Forces during the war. The bunker named ' Battle Box' is a must see attraction for those who have interest in the history. The war time era is recreated inside the bunker with some interesting wax statues of army generals in command and background voice overs. Very interesting indeed
,,A nice break from the pace,4.0,,"The park provides a very peaceful break once you get the point where you just can't do any more shopping. Like much of Singapore it is laced with historic buildings and artifacts. Particularly interesting is the cemetery wall, with inscriptions back to the early 1800's.

However, you'll need to take your time on the park, as it is on the one decent hill in the CBD area, and you really notice the humidity when the heart rate rises."
,,The Fort Canning Experience,5.0,,"Fort Canning is a lovely park and historic site. A great memorial to the surrender of Singapore during World War II, and those who fought to save Singapore. This is a Lush and beautiful walk through history. Be sure to include the Battle Box on your vist."
,,Ok park,2.0,,"I'm not sure what to look out for in this park. It has some quiet spots, and some weekends you can spot couples having wedding shoots at the park."
,,Nice historic park in the big city,5.0,,"Nice green spot with historical significance right on town.

Interesting history attached to the area all the way from a sacred spot for early natives all the way through a British colonial govt enclave to military usage. And now a beautiful park.

Take time to walk and explore."

,,An oasis of peace in a busy city.,5.0,,"This park is conveniently located and is well served by public transport. If you have trouble walking, it may be better to catch a taxi to the Fort Canning Hotel and wend your way down on the many paths that take you to the various attractions.
The park is on an historic hill which was the site of the 14th century kings, Raffles house and the army command centre where the decision to surrender Singapore was made in WW2.
So much history.
There are nine gardens including Raffles Garden and the Spice Garden. Sang Nila Utama Garden is a must see with its flowers, ponds and statuettes.
Winding paths and steep steps help you navigate through this magnificent park. Expansive lawns, brilliant flowers and impressive trees - something for everyone."
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"The world media has covered Singapore's efforts to go green very well. There are vertical gardens along building surfaces, old trees line up major arteries, etc. However, there are also beautiful parks in the midst of the city. Fort Canning is one of them, with historic value to boot. It's a must see in Singapore, with its beautiful gardens, well-tended lanes and elegant trees."
,,Bicentenial singapore,5.0,,"Excellent exhibition n acts to share how singapore arrives till now. Book tickets now, ending in september. Great!!"
,,Singapore Bicentennial Celebration,5.0,,"It was a steamy afternoon in the park as I walked around looking at the hotel, the original entrance gate to the old fort and the outdoor Keramat for the last ruler of Singapore.

Thus I was quite happy to have stumbled across Singapore‚Äôs Bicentennial Celebration being held in the main building in Fort Canning and get some needed AC. As luck would have it tickets had to be reserved in advance but I put my name on the waiting list anyway. They said it could be awhile but I was called within five minutes! For free admission, well worth it!

The celebration show was a great production combining both live acting with innovative stages and great sound and video. The show progressed from Singapore‚Äôs original settlement, its first ruler, WWII and then all the way to the present. It was a celebration not only of the country but its diverse population.

After the show I wandered through some of the open air exhibits in very unique structures. Books, maps and other items were showcased.

The other parts of the park to enjoy was behind the Centre with its large open lawn great for picnics or just hanging out, beautiful gardens, the overlook with canons and and the out of place headstone and monument remains of an old Jesuit cemetery."
,,Short cut but most informative,5.0,,Took a shortcut from Clarke Quay to Dohby Gourt Station. Thought it would be gust a walk in the park but turned out to be an excursion all of it own. Follow the signs from the bridge at Clarke Quey walk past the Mica Building which was apparently the first Singapore police station and later used as an interrogation centre by the Japanese in WW11. Clime the steps up to Raffles House and the lighthouse. The walk takes you past the old Fort with its WW11 Bunkers. If you are feeling flush you can have high tea at Hotel Fort Canning before dropping down to Orchard Road.

I had to see and experience it for myself and all good words were dead on! The entire park, so well maintained and well lit regardless of the time. You'd also feel safe even running early in the morning. I had the entire place to myself running past 4 am... Even better, head on out to the footbridge and it connects you to Clarke Quay area. Head on out farther (following the underpasses) should lead you to where the Merlion is (obviously another awesome place to run!). There's no other place I'd stay in the next time I visit Singapore soon."

Be prepared for plenty of steps!"

The archeological site is still a work in progress."

,,Worth a visit,4.0,,We did a tour of the underground bunkers where the British surrendered to the Japanese in WW2. Definitely worth a visit it was a very informative tour.
,,Good to spend family time,4.0,,"Its got history, its got garden, its got large acreage to walk about, its nice to be within nature with your family or just alone. The building is well maintained and the lawn is nice place to host a small picnic."
,,Great park for walking or jogging.,4.0,,"Went through this park late in the morning. If you like to exercise this park has a lot of people using it for that purpose. I loved the large trees and their broad canopies provided wonderful shade from the tropical sun. There was an interesting spice garden area, archeological dig, and a small cafe for snacks and drinks."
,,Lots of steps,4.0,,"There are a lot of steps and hilly parts to enter the park which ever direction you come from, probably why the park was so quiet.

We went to the park to visit Battlebox, WW11 government bunker. only accessible by a tour.

Not much else to visit the park for. The views in places are good if the city."
,,ILight festival,4.0,,"We once again visited the Fort canning park, this time for the Ilight festival, held in Feb. It was great. My daughter played happily on the piano kept for visitors. Was a lovely evening"
,,Hidden gem,5.0,,"This park was a 5 minute walk from the YMCA One Orchard. A lovely place to walk around and just be in nature, but also with history behind it from WW2 for those with an interest. The park is free along with lots of historical facts. There was a paid entry story about the war but we did not go there. Quite hilly for those who cannot manage stairs/hills easily."
,,Very good,4.0,,"Freeto walk around but not well signposted and a lot of works going on meant some footpaths were closed.
Very nice and not too crowded.
Certain things to do are to be paid for and as I was short if time I didn't do these.
But the open areas and footpaths are great to walk round"
,,Lots of work; poor signposting,3.0,,"Given its significance in Singapore's history, I was keen to see Fort Canning. On the day I went, I was somewhat disappointed. There is a lot of heavy construction work going on on the Fort Canning MRT station side, with paths suddenly closed with no prior warning (very annoying on a steep hill in the heat!) At the top is now a reservoir that you cannot visit. Getting down the other side was as much of a challenge as getting in. Sort your signs out, FCP!!!"
,,The BattleBox Tour is a must,5.0,,"I was in Singapore in 1960, age 6, and this place was where my dad worked. It is a really peaceful park with great trees, lawns, historical military walks and the awesome presenter at the BATTLEBOX is a must."
,,Historic,4.0,,Its a steep hill so beware of the climb Best to come early to beat the heat and crowds .Very historic and beautiful gardens.
,,"Wonderful, interesting nature filled walk.",4.0,,"This is a super park, packed full of interesting trees and plants (many labelled) - you can hardly believe you are in the middle of a city. There is a circular walk around the top with plenty of interesting things to see, some great views, great bird watching, public toilets and lots of places to sit. Lots of people seem to mention how steep it is. Yes - you have to get up to the hill, but after that it's a largely flat, leisurely walk round the top. And although steep, it's a short walk, don't let it put you off. Next to the fantastic National Museum so combine the two."
,,Great park,4.0,,"We had a great early morning stroll in Fort Canning Park. It‚Äôs super steep, and we were quickly very hot and sticky. We only went because it was right next to our hotel - and I am not sure I would have travelled across the city to it. But the park is nice, and well shaded and seemed to be popular with expat joggers. There was quite a lot of building work going on when we visited which put us off slightly."
,,Rich on history,4.0,,"Walk for 2 hours in this beautiful park with a lot of history which was called before ‚ÄòGovernment hill‚Äô. ‚ÄòOriginal‚Äô pictures are displayed with information to have an idea how fort Canning was in the early days of Singapore.
Quite some renovations ongoing in the park"
,,Must go,4.0,,"You can get more photo from here haha. But many tourist come. At Check point, you should come early ( I think) because in the afternoon maybe more people here."
,,"Beautiful, Historic Park in the middle of Singapore",4.0,,"Fort Canning Park occupies a very significant and strategic location, adjacent to the Singapore River and close to the downtown business district as well as Orchard Road.

Once the home of the ruling Malay kings, more recently, during the Second World Way, it was the british army headquarters when they made the infamous decision to surrender to the Japanese.

There are steep walks here [being a hill] but if you like gardens, it is well worth it. This was also the first site of the Singapore Botanic gardens."
,,"Nice environment, with construction sites.",4.0,,"We visited last Sat morning with kids, it was a pleasant and easy walk. Kind of hot as there is no covered way. Kids enjoyed the small swing and the 2 cannons, took many photos. Giving the prime location of the park, it is really a must visit for both locals and tourists. Remember the old days when Mr Lee still preferred a walk there, bumped into him once."
,,Nice park and gardens although the museum was closed on our trip.,4.0,,Finally got to visit Fort Canning Park this trip and can cross it off the bucket list. Worth a visit if you like parks and gardens but it is very steep and lots of stairs and uphill climbing and in the humidity it's not easy. Don't know if there is an easier way in we did it the hard way and was not disappointed.
,,Historically significant and well worth a visit.,5.0,,Fort Canning is where the Englishman Sir Stamford Raffles built his residence which was also used by other residents and governors. It became known as Government Hill until it was renamed Fort Canning in 1861 when a fort was built on the site.
,,Greennnnyyy,5.0,,"Love this hidden gem.Its very good spot for take a pic. Prepare your ootd and its free,just go here in the morning or afternoon"
,,Very nice walking trails,4.0,,Lots of construction. The park could use better access instruction from SMRT. I enjoyed a few hours wandering there and reading the historic contexts and seeing the older buildings
,,Battle Box,5.0,,"Joanna did a fantastic tour today, very informative and was fantastic to listen to. Well worth the visit Thankyou"
,,Nice walk but a bit of a building site,3.0,,Lovely shady walk on a hot day and very relaxing with certain spots affording lovely views. The afternoon I chose to visit was very quite which was lovely but it was a shame about all the building and repair work going on. It is still worth a visit and the grounds are very lush and lovely. Lots of stairs to climb but they are well maintained.
,,A park in the middle of the city,4.0,,Hot and humid Singapore! So come here in the late evening and try to catch the sunset at Raffles Terrace. Interesting view of the Singapore River as well as Marina Bay Sands! Lots of wild birds and animals too. Was hoping to see a Hornbill but saw Jungle Fowls instead. Interesting flora.
,,Good place for walking on a hot day,3.0,,"The park is cool and green but is really not suitable for people with disabilities as there are lots of stairs to climb to get from one part to another. Could not do the Battlebox as all tours were fully booked, and you can't get in without a tour which was disappointing. The herb garden was nice as was the shrine to the last Sultan, Iskander Shah, which was right next to the herb garden. The garden has good descriptions of the various tropical herbs for anyone who is interested in spices. Plenty of birds and butterflies but no other wildlife to be seen. It is worth doing if you are interested in the history of Singapore and want a bit more than the national museum can offer."
,,Hill-top quiet green space in Singapore,5.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a large public green space in the heart of Singapore yet on the afternoon of our visit we saw very few visitors virtually having the park to yourselves where ever we walked. The park is loaded with things to see, the main reason we were there was to visit the Battlebox, the underground WW2 military bunker. The park is located on the hill behind the National Museum of Singapore, there was a short climb up a series of staircases to reach the Battlebox visitors centre and the park. Later after our Battlebox tour we wandered around Fort Canning Park enjoying the many outdoor art sculptures, gardens, extensive varieties of plants, memorial walls, old buildings and other structures before exiting near the old Pollice Station at Clarke Quay."
,,Historic Park,4.0,,"Nice park with some decent views of the city. Take the circuitous walk around the resevior to see the old lighthouse, flag pole, gardens, and remnants of the fort. We didn't do the Battlebox Tour as it was 20 dollars a person and little kids aren't permitted. Maybe some other time. The park itself is free."
,,I got a sense of some of Singapore's past,4.0,,"An interesting park with plenty of shade and informative signs. There was a lot of renovation going on when we were there, but still lots to see. It was interesting to see the old gravestones and see how many people died at a very young age in the 1800s. We'll visit another time to do the tour of the Bunker, but it looked good."
,,Visit with friends,3.0,,"We made some good memories that's true but it is not very stroller friendly. We had a nice picnic and took nice pictures but since our toddlers could not climb so many stairs up the fort, we left early and went to some other place."
,,Jewel in the City's Crown,5.0,,"Singapore has many charming and idilic locations but Fort Canning Park remains my favourite place in the City State. We walked thought it many times in the 1980‚Äôs when it was pretty much derelict, evocative and slightly eerie but today it provides a beautiful, elevated, shady oasis of tranquility overlooking and overlooked by the frenetic City. Fort Canning Park is steeped in history from the ancient and pre-colonial eras to the fall of Empires, it is or has been the abode of Kings, a botanic garden, a cemetery, a fortress, place of government, a park and to visit it is an education. We have always stayed on Orchard Road and walk through Fort Canning Park when we visit China Town, the CBD, the Bay Area, the Colonial District, sometimes we go there just to enjoy the Park it‚Äôs self. The Park is quite small but so full of interest that it can fill at least half, possible a whole day. Some of the things to do; visit the cemetery with it‚Äôs Gothic Gates, cupolas and memorials, review the memorial stones and appreciate how very short were the lives of the early settlers and traders. View the colonial buildings that grace the park, one is now the Fort Canning Hotel the other the Fort Canning Centre, both are architecturally significant. Walk the Spice Garden, FCP was part of the original botanic garden and many experimental plants were grown here, a small botanic trail remains and the plaques are most informative. See the archeological excavations in progress, they are open to public view, well described and have many interesting artefacts to illustrate the history of this once forbidden hill. Visit the Old Lighthouse and learn about its technical evolution and the courage of those who risked their lives to care for it during the Japanese occupation. Take a look at the Time Ball that marked 13:00 each day and the historic Flag Staff, both are close to the site of Raffle‚Äôs bungalow and well described by boards at their locations. Visit the (alleged but unlikely) tomb of Iskander Shah and read the myth of his violent accession to the throne of ancient Singapore (Tamasek). Walk the terraces named after the influential men who made and managed Singapore, Raffles, Farquhar, Bond, Lewin, Dobbie and others. Visit the military installations and buildings, the great gates of the fort itself (try pushing them closed!), escape through the Sally Port, pose for photos on the old cannons and if you get the opportunity book on a guided tour of the hill itself and of the Battle Box, both are thoroughly worth while if you have any interest in history and the lives of those who made Singapore‚Äôs history. Apart from the history, the flora and fauna are surprisingly rich and varied for a small City centre park, Red Junglefowl scratch around, sunbirds can be heard and occasionally glimpsed and apparently the park is popular with local ornithologists. Walk the Tree Route, many of the trees are quite magnificent and there are numerous photo opportunities which, with a little framing will give the appearance of being taken in deep jungle not a city centre. If you are keen to work out, join those who run up and down the steps at Canning Rise, jog the paths that weave through park or visit the fitness station near Badang Terrace. If you want a break from exploring the park, the National Museum of Singapore is accessible directly from the hill and apart from the exhibitions there is also a very nice restaurant that serves tea from the Clipper Tea Company and delicious cakes. The Park is delightful after dark, I sometimes take a stroll there to enjoy the tranquility and let my imagination wonder to those ancient Malay Kings whose graves lie still undiscovered in this very special place."
,,A compact historical landmark,4.0,,"Fort Canning is a breath of fresh air in the middle of the bustle and dazzle of Singapore. It is set up on a foothill just enough for tourist and local to go hiking and jogging in a beautifully landscaped trail . Every turn is marked with historical notes on a signpost which cleverly enough overlooks the beautiful Clarke Quay . We enjoyed nature, history , culture rolled into one . A must try in Singapore . No entrance fees ."
,,Great for History Buffs,5.0,,My husband is quite the avid War Buff and he & our daughter found this place fascinating! They operate Tours pretty much daily - The Battlebox Tour (hour and 15mins) was well worth the visit.
,,Well kept,5.0,,Very well kept gardens and grounds. A nice peaceful spot in the heart of the city. Good to have a wander through.
,,"Nice park, historic center of Singapore",4.0,,"Nice park on a small hill. Close to Orchard Road. Nice destination if you want some green spaces. Lots of history here, including old British military HQ buried inside the hill. Takes about 45 min to walk around and see the main sights."
,,An oasis in the middle of the the city,5.0,,"I loved visiting this park, and grabbed any opportunity I could get to go through this park by cutting through it to go to the other side! Its close to Clark Quay on one side and Orchard Road near Dhoby Ghaut on another side.

The first time I spent a couple of hours reading all the well-laid out signages (Singapore loves signages!) and the next few times I would just wander around it, or read a book. Its a quiet and peaceful place right in the middle of the city, and a haven for nature lovers. Just be sure to carry your umbrella and some insect repellent."
,,"The ""must"" photo shooting spot",4.0,,"Stunning spot for photo shooting. There are many ppl skip the park and just go photo shooting at this spot. Dhauby Ghaut MRT, exit B, then cross the street the the left following the walk way you will see this spot."
,,"Historic, Serene and Peaceful",5.0,,"This is a must see whilst in Singapore. To view the tunnels is by tour guide only and when inside, you can fully appreciate why. The grounds are pristine."
,,Fort Canning A Gem of History & Nature,5.0,,The walking tour to fort canning was a pleasant one and very informative with the history of the beginning of Singapore. My guide Pavla was showing us a walk through time the resting place of the last king of Singapore. üëç
,,Wonderful park,5.0,,"Singapore has a number of fine parks and this is definitely one of them. Even though you are in the middle of a very busy city, you can get away from the traffic and crowds of people and get some peace and quiet in beautiful surroundings. Well worth a visit."
,,Beautiful Garden with a view of the city,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a little bit of a haven in Singapore - as it is away from the hustle and bustle of the city. In the colonial days of British rule, it served as the army barracks and its headquarters.

It is worth climbing the stairs to the top of the hill to get a good view of the city.

The area has the Fort Canning Arts Centre - an impressive looking building; the Register of Marriages; and the artillery. The area hosts various concerts.

The garden has a spice garden."
,,Really worth a stroll around this old fort,5.0,,"If you like walking, and aren't too worried about slopes and steps, then a walk around this historic park you'll enjoy. There is plenty of history around the park, as well as the WW2 Battlebox."
,,Oasis in city,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a very pleasant park in the middle of Singapore. A hill itself is a park, and you can take a walk without being disturbed by car. It is not hard to climb, and I am sure it is worth."
,,Park with a History - Fort Canning Park Singapore,4.0,,"Quite unlike the nature reserve protected for its flora and fauna or an area of important geological or special interests with its unique ecosystems, parks are ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù with humans in mind for various purposes largely recreational ‚Äì jogging, walking and cycling, or social gatherings like a picnics or a perhaps a date.

But Fort Canning Park (Singapore) offers more than leisure and recreation. It is a park rich in history. Sitting at the hilltop, it has witnessed many of the country‚Äôs historical milestones. Apparently, it used to site palaces before the founding of modern Singapore. It was made Headquarters of the Far East Command Centre and British Army Barracks during the colonial days. The decision to surrender to the Japanese in 1942 was also made on the hill.

I have been to Fort Canning Park on several occasions but for events ‚Äì outdoor concerts, movie screening under the stars, hotel dining, etc. This visit I recently made was a different one where I took time walking through and around the park.

There are a number of walking trails rich in history presented by replicas of a past era such as flagstaff, lighthouse and 9-pound cannon, ruins of the fort left along with preserved underground tunnels.

This park is right in the centre of the city but yet away from the hustle and bustle of city life. It is somewhat strange to see in the backdrop around the park with skyscrapers on one side, the riverside / quays on another, and yet a serene view of a church just down the hill. And for the romantic, the park is also a favourite photo-shoot venue for weddings as it is neighbour to the ROM (Registry of Marriages).

It is also a home to the arts, playing hosts to concerts, theatre productions and festivals. The lush greenery and expansive lawns offer a variety of arts, heritage and nature experiences. The Fort Canning Arts Centre was undergoing some upgrading when I visited and as I understand, it is part of the enhancements to Fort Canning Park and its surroundings which will be progressively completed from June 2019.

If you are a history puff and enjoy a leisurely walk in a park under the cool umbrellas of trees (my favourite has to be the Banyan Trees), come visit the park. Or if you want an early morning jog around the greenery on a hilltop, this is a good place to sweat it out. Should you plan to visit during organised events, make time before / after the activity to see what this park has to offer.

From some National Parks Singapore materials, development plans are underway ""where the heritage landscapes of Fort Canning Hill and its surroundings will be restored and weaved seamlessly into Fort Canning Park with the creation of three gardens, namely the Royal Garden, the First Botanic Garden, and Jubilee Park"".

Make a date and visit the Park in the latter half of 2019."
,,Better park than historic site,3.0,,"Fort Canning had strategic and historic importance to Singapore. Oh the hilltop overlooking the river, it served as the gateway for decades. Named for the first Viceroy after the British Crown took possession of the lands managed by the East India Tea Company following the loss in the American Revolution.
The grounds are beautiful and the views very cool, but other than the old gate, the gates that served as entry to the old cemetery, and the bunker (which can be toured), there is not much ""fort"" to it anymore. Two canon are perched at high points, but those are not original and reset in the 1950s.
Great history - better as a park. As a history buff I enjoyed it, but do not expect to see an old battlement."
,,Good walk to see the city,4.0,,Take the stairs to to the dirt to get a good view of the city. It can be hot but on the day we want it had just rained so it‚Äôs quite nice taking around. The trees are massive and provide good coverage. Very interesting trees and branches and tree stubs. It‚Äôs close to the fort canning hotel and there‚Äôs a museum as well. You can see two cannons on either side of the park. There‚Äôs a guided tour to the old battleground hide out but we didn‚Äôt go in.
,,Beautiful Garden Amidst The Beautiful City,4.0,,"It's a beautiful garden and a nice place to have a walk or jog. You'll feel amazing walking here.

You get free entry in the garden. If you're in Singapore, I think it's a place to visit.

The place is well connected by a metro station near to it."
,,A stunning garden in the heart of town,5.0,,"I was recommended this place from a Singaporean friend. This garden is a gorgeous place to stroll through, whilst taking in the historic surrounds. Located within walking distance from multiple MRT stations, the signage makes it very easy to navigate. I walked in from the north side, and made my way towards Circular Quay, however it is very easy to lose yourself for several hours in this peaceful environment. It is quite hilly, so I wouldn't recommended for those with mobility restrictions."
,,Greenery !!!,4.0,,"Walked along Coleman Street and up the Canning Rise , involves climbing several steps. Large area, full of greenery. Different types of plants all around. Didn't get time to visit the bunker."
,,Historical site,4.0,,"A historical site that provides a glimpse of Singapore leading up to WW2. It is the site where the British General Percival decided to surrender to Japanese forces. There is a paid guided tour of the underground bunkers. Check the tour time if interested before going. History aside, it is a peaceful green space to stroll and take a break from the city bustle."
,,Brings to life events surrounding defense and surrender of Singapore to the Japanese,5.0,,"Well worth the time. Go into the bunker and learn about a piece of history that many don‚Äôt appreciate or know much about. Learn how 50,000 Japanese with superior equipment and fighting experience overwhelmed a poorly equipped British Empire force of 120,000. See the confined spaces the allied forces lived in and where the decision was made to surrender. Through a mix of docent, historical recreations of some the rooms and movies they take you through the story and leave you with a very memorable experience. Don‚Äôt miss this."
,,Beautiful garden hidden in the midst of a great city,4.0,,"We spent a morning walking around the gardens of Fort Canning- lovely shady areas with pathways and seating areas. We were going to do the Battlebox Tour, but all the morning tours were full- would suggest booking if you want to do a tour at a specific time. You can easily spend hours walking around the grounds of the estate and forget the city on the outside of the walls."
,,An Oasis,5.0,,"What an incredible place. The fort and bunker are set on a famous hill, only 5 minute walk from the nearest MRT.

Well worth paying around $18 for the bunker tour that takes about 90 minutes. Very informative and the guide was very happy to answer any questions. He really bought to live what happened there during WW2.

The parks around the fort are some of the best in Singapore.

Allow 2 to 3 hours to really enjoy and respect this monument to all those is WW2."
,,Interesting piece of history,4.0,,"Recommend timing your visit to also take in the ""Battle Box"" and a tour through the tunnels to get the most out of this site."
,,Pretty average,4.0,,"Not the most interesting place, but nice to kill time here if you‚Äôre in singapore for a few extra days with nothing to do. Wear some comfortable shoes and bring water on a hot day, as there are many steps!"
,,Better on a cloudy day,4.0,,We picked the wrong entrance to get to Battlebox thinking Fort Canning MRT would be the obvious stop. We had to climb lots of steps and it was muggy. Some steps are also closed for works. We found are way round but imagine the upward climb would be hell on a hot day. An interesting park with an important place in history.
,,Beautiful established gardens heart of Singapore,4.0,,"We loved immersing ourselves in the luxury of walking, smelling and enjoying the beauty of Fort Canning Park. A must visit is the Old British Army headquarters now an upmarket Hotel. Go to historic Fort Canning British military barracks ( under renovation) and must do Battle Box tour.
A lovely space with quietness in the heart of Singapore.
Would be 5 star however garden renovations underway."
,,Crazy Rich Heritage.,3.0,,This is a park but it is also a treasure trove of Singapore past and history dates back to 1600s. If you like history and imagininv yourself back in the olden days. This is THE place. Downside...it is undergoing a revamp. Upside...there are still many trees around....not invaded by buildings yet.
,,Battle box was visited by my husband and me in fort canning park,5.0,,"It is place which tells you about the surrender of British army.We were amazed the way the guide explained to us ,her knowledge about the subject was great not a minute during our tour into battle box we felt bored. Well conducted and knowledgeable.Very well kept. Kudos to the people who are maintaining the place.A must visit for locals and tourists."
,,Architecture meets nature,5.0,,"If you are into architecture and Plants or if you are an aspiring photographer this is the place for you, just be ready for a LONG WALK,
wear your most comfortable sneakers..
but it will all be worth it, Trust the Photos that I have uploaded :)"
,,Fort Canning Park Singapore,4.0,,"This is a nice place to go for a walk or run.. Very shady will lots of trees... Also there is a spice gardens where you can see plants of pepper, coriander etc..."
,,Bird Watchers Dream,5.0,,"This park is such a relaxing & tranquil place. There is an assortment of birdlife including White-bellied Sea eagles. Whilst there my partner & I spotted 20 species of birds without even trying. The park grounds & gardens are well maintained & clean with beautiful shady trees, some steeped in history. The park has guided tours to the Fort Canning ""Battlebox"" where the British conceded surrender to the Japanese in 1942 and of various historical sites Fort Canning Hill. If you just want to kick back and relax in the park, in the cool & shade of the trees whilst in the centre of Singapore central, then this park is well worth the visit. For the exercise conscious, there are plenty of well maintained paths/stairs for a good run or walk."
,,A view of the past,5.0,,"If your interested in the story of Singapores surrender and the daily activities of running the war here this is a great place to start. The battle box is by tour only costing $18 for a adult and $9 for a child, tours run for about 1 hour 15 minutes and walk you through the bunkers used during the defence of singapore we had a great guide his knowledge was outstanding as we walked from room to room it is set up some what as it looked during operations at the time. It is under ground if you have any fears the rooms are big well lit and air conditioned.
Tour times vary with Monday afternoons only, the rest of the week including weekends from 9.45am"
,,Something other than the bus,5.0,,"We were intent on getting back to Bencoolen Street so, rather than take a taxi, bus or the MRT, we decided to walk over the hill. It's a little steep but the route is lined with fabulous heritage trees. There are some signs telling people to beward of lightning strike and some far too unfriendly ones indicating anyone who climbs the fence and gets into the reservoir area will be shot. At the top is the Battlebox, the site of a British cock-up that handed 120,000 men to the Japanese in WWII. Tours only at set times. Wander down the other side to the National History Museum and Orchard Road."
,,Greenery abounds,5.0,,"I barely scratched the surface when visiting this park but I still highly recommend a visit. Would be great for a run. I had a nice nice stroll despite the heat. Enjoyed all the trees, plants, herbs, and flowers, plus the slopes, architecture (Raffles House) and beautiful pathways. If you are looking to escape the city with all its concrete and glass structures, this place is worth a visit."
,,Relaxing despite hot weather.,5.0,,A great park with great view. There are cannons and along the way are history about singapore‚Äôs origins. Lots of trees including a Petai tree which bears the petai vegetable.
,,Bunker tour worth it!,4.0,,"My hubby & I did the 2.5hr walking bunker tour. To be honest, I did it for hubby, but really enjoyed the whole experience.

Our tour guide Weina (""pronounced like the American sausage"" as she told us ), was fabulous. Clear English, very informative & had a great sense of humour.

The bunker was awesome, but you're not allowed to take photos inside (fair enough), learnt so much. We had planned to do another tour elsewhere, but didn't need to. However, we did visit the Old Ford Factory where Singapore was surrendered to the Japanese (this was a heavy experience).

Although you're given a bottle of ice cold water for the walk, I reccomend taking an extra & make sure you'rewearing really comfy shoes (you'll need it!)"
,,Unhappy though Lovely room and ambience,3.0,,"I found the ambience and rooms lovely at Fort Canning hotel. The personal touch or warmth was missing in their services. I found the food below average in the Salon restaurant. Both my meals lunch and dinner were bad. The waitresses are clueless about the menu and not comfortable with english. I would expect a 5 star hotel staff to have menu knowledge and at least be able to communicate. The breakfast was good though. Another hugely disappointing incident was use of mobile phones by house keeping staff in the corridor outside the room. It was annoying to be woken up at 7 while they were cleaning with their phone ringing constantly. Utter rubbish!
All in all I felt cheated for the money I spent didnt get me what i expected. I hope they improve."
,,Very relaxing,5.0,,"Right in the middle of the city, this historic point is a well preserved, lush and verdant park that is worth a visit if you‚Äôre interested in the history of Singapore or just want a break from the bustle of the city. Even on a Saturday it‚Äôs not very crowded."
,,Open space and green escape,4.0,,"Peaceful park with lawns, gardens, sculptures and cultural heritage. Hilltop location, nice views. Historical landmarks (includes the gate of the old fortress). Spice garden. Take a wander. Easily accessible and close to other attractions."
,,Sanctuary,5.0,,in the heart of the city next to Clarke Quay the lively and busiest nightlife in Singapore just a step to enter totally different atmosphere take a deep breath and feel the silence and walk back with new energizing feeling.
,,Educational in both history and greenery,5.0,,"We decided to do a walkabout because not only was there a new MRT station nearby but we‚Äôve never explored the location in our numerous visits to Singapore. It was amazingly refreshing being out in real clean fresh air amongst the greenery. The Spice Garden was interesting although it would benefit from more little explanation cards of the plant species. The best historically ‚Äúfind‚Äù was the Embankment Tour - tour guide Joanne gave a really good running commentary of the bunker and run-up to the surrender of the island, emotional is how I felt at the end of that tour. Well worth the $18 charge.
Only criticism we had was the offices to the National Parks were shut tightly and we had no way of getting our way around so based on the posted signs we eventually found what we wanted in a rounabout way! Considering it was a public holiday on our visit, very disappointed information from those well located offices (next to cafe) was shut tight!"
,,History,5.0,,"Very beautiful park with a lot of history about the settlement of Singapore and WW2, very interesting."
,,Green Lungs of Singapore,5.0,,"Went for a morning walk in Fort Canning Park which is easily reachable by Bus...it is a lush green oasis in the midst of modern Singapore architecture...easy climb by stairs or by a walking track with dense vegetation on both sides...many morning walkers come here..you pass next to Fort Canning Hotel & Battle Box..entry to the Park is free but entry to Battle Box is charged..at the top of the hillock is a Water Reservoir...no one is permitted to go there..you get a beautiful, panoramic view ...as you walk down the slope , you reach MRT station...worth a visit.."
,,Well worth the visit,4.0,,We decided to walk ‚Äòthrough Singapore‚Äô via the Forest Canning park and grounds. The area is certainly very interesting and certainly worth the effort to get there. We spent perhaps 2 hours wandering around on the way through to other areas. Recommended.
,,Great quiet walk in the hear of the city,4.0,,"In the hear of Singapore lies Fort Canning, known primarily as the location for British HQ during World War 2 prior to the British capitulation. Great tour of the underground HQ itself via Battle Box tours.

The hill itself is an elliptical path around the hill with various informative signs throughout, mostly historic in nature. In general a nice quiet route with some glimpses of the city through the high trees. Unfortunately, and this causes the downgrade, one can not go to the top of the hill for a much broader view as there is a wired off reservoir on the summit, with those nasty little signs showing an individual pointing a gun at another all around...unfortunate.

Well worth taking an hour out of your day for the hike..bring water."
,,Interesting visit,4.0,,Once I‚Äôd got up the numerous flights of stairs (which felt like I was doing some proper exercise!) you reach the top of the park and it‚Äôs quite pretty to look at. There are guided tours here if you wished to do one. Otherwise just park yourself on a bench and enjoy the serene surroundings! There are parts of the old fort still visible. Nice little park to be fair
,,Tour of history,5.0,,The Fort Canning Park is an iconic park and the area is really lovely. You'll get to learn a lot about the area and its significance once you tour the inside. It also has a few restaurants and i quite like the Indian restaurant there (Myras).
,,A nice park,4.0,,Fort Canning is a nice park. Be prepared for some climbing as it is mostly a hill. It has some interesting information boards about the history of the area.
,,Nice park...big!,3.0,,"First, it is just a park. But as city parks go it is a very good one, And quite large. There are lots of pavilions and remnants from fort that was here during WWII. Be aware that there are some steep sections with a lot of stairs, so you will get your walking in."
,,Much is missing unfortunately,3.0,,"I guess it is what it is and they are doing a great job of finding and preserving the past. Unfortunately compared to places like Melaka and Penang as well as some of the other old British colonies, much has been lost. I was unlucky that Battlebox wasn't open on a Sunday. It is still a pretty good spot to walk around and relax."
,,Interesting visit,5.0,,"My cousin suggested we visit this place, I wasn‚Äôt sure if our kids would take any interest, especially the younger one, he is 6, anyway we purchased the tickets for the battle box bunker tour . We were pleasantly surprised by the well organized tour and the knowledge of the person showing us around. What made it even more interesting is the quiz question at the end of the tour which our elder son (9 yrs old) answered correctly and won a great prize.
The park around that area is well maintained and great to walk around."
,,Lovely a quiet in the morning,4.0,,I took an early morning walk here when it was still cool. Access is up steps and there are plenty of shady places to rest if needed. The whole area is a very nice a quiet spot and the Battlebox is well worth a visit if you have time.
,,A must do if you have the time!,5.0,,Such a pleasant place for a wander amidst jungle foliage. Interesting trails and very well sign posted. Look out for names of local trees. Good views from the top.
,,Relaxing and peaceful,5.0,,"After our tour of the National Museum, we chanced upon this beautiful park while looking for a place to eat. It felt very peaceful and relaxing to just sit under the trees. There were only a few people about. Some are walking, others are jogging, and a handful are sitting in the benches taking in the view."
,,a peaceful oasis in the middle of the city,4.0,,"Fort Canning is like a breath of fresh air after the hustle and bustle of every day life. Located in the middle of the city, this park is like an oasis filled with lush greenery. It is better to come here early in the morning before the heat of the day makes it unbearable, and be sure to wear comfortable foot wear and bring drinking water. There are several historical and educational markers as well, which details the history of Fort Canning and describes some of the plants seen here. This is another side of Singapore and it's worth a visit!"
,,Breath taking,5.0,,"First you need to wear a comfortable cloth and a sport shoes, it is a long walk. Don't forget umbrella in case it rains out of sudden. Fort canning is a wonderful place to visit. It is part of history and is reserved beaufully. You learn a bit of history by visiting it.it us located near Singapore national museum. The collection of trees and plants is amazing. Fresh air, taste of history, greenery that relaxes the soul and mind. Thus place is a must to visit if you visit Singapore"
,,Nice place for a run,5.0,,Take a run here to forget about the city. Close by you can also see the fire house also. Great place!
,,Relaxing garden,4.0,,"On a hot day it was nice to sit in the park and relax for a bit. It is green and well manicured, which makes the walking trails throughout the park a nice experience with a young child."
,,A beautiful city park,4.0,,"If you are tired of the fast pace of Singapore and all of the concrete, steel and glass, make your way to Ft. Canning Park where they have beautiful walking trails complete with historical markers. It is much cooler in the shade of the many trees along the path, and you will see many people enjoying the park with picnics. Don't miss the Battle Box, which gives you a tour of the British command station during World War II."
,,Relaxing and Pretty,5.0,,Fort Canning Park is a lovely relaxing place in Singapore. Full of history you can enjoy the place just walking the trails or taking part in activities such as the Battlebox tour. Lovely and green and well manicured gardens make this a place worth seeing
,,Lovely park with interesting history,4.0,,Central location near Fort Canning MRT. Lovely green area with various walking tracks to explore. We did the Fort Canning Tour including the Battlebox. A great way to learn about the history of this interesting site.
,,Nice walk especially in the morning,4.0,,A place filled of historical items. A very well maintained park. There are activities like the battle box where you can know more about the time the British soldier defended Singapore.
,,Historic place,3.0,,"There has been a military fortress here, and now the place has been turned into a park. There is a military bunker that has been turned into a museum, and a palace. It is generally not a tourist attraction."
,,Great place to wander,4.0,,"If you enjoy history and want to learn a bit more about Singapore this is a great place to go. It‚Äôs actually right in the city and walking distance from the train station. It‚Äôs worth walking around at your own pace as there‚Äôs lots to see, read and admire. Could easily spend a few hours here exploring the place."
,,Not a normal tourist destination but a lovely location for a walk in a historic park,5.0,,"This was another one for the memory banks for me. Famous for its gates, historic, Colonial connection and the Battle Box it is another lovely public space in this city. We accessed it by the escalator near the National Museum which saves a bit of a climb in the heat. More popular with locals than tourists but I enjoyed the walk around."
,,Visit on Open Day,4.0,,"We visited while the park was running an open day (or I should say a number of open days) with a number of exhibitions, talks and stalls. We attended an in depth talk on orchids by an academic from the Botanic Garden, and viewed an exhibition on how FCP was going to change in the near future.

Other than this a walk around the park is very pleasant and quiet, and is not too large to involve long waking in the heat.There are a number of entrances/exits, so you can take your pick depending on where you have come from or where you are going next."
,,Many Spices Grow in one Place,4.0,,"The spice garden at Fort canning Park is an extensive sampling of many spice plants that are hard to find all growing in one garden. The spice garden alone should be given at least 2 hours if you want to learn about the spices and take the time to study the plants as well. There are different spices in bloom and with fruit at various times of the year so you may only see some of the fruit at a given visit time but there are short descriptions of the nature of the spice, how it is harvested, and how it is used. Some spice plants actually make several different spices from various parts of the plant or fruit. If you are interested in the use of spices and where they come from, this will be a great place for you to visit."
,,peaceful walk,3.0,,"Not much to do exactly, but was a pleasant walk around . Very quite and peaceful with no traffic noise."
,,A place of history.,4.0,,This old fort has been transformed to a centre for lots of activity. Its great to see the people of Singapore enjoying this place as well as tourists. Great exhibition and talk on Orchids and a display the way development is working.
,,Great Park for a hilly run,5.0,,I stayed at the Novotel hotel right beside this park. It was very convent for running in. Nice big paths with lots of hills.
,,A park which makes you love Singapore even more,5.0,,"This is a gem in the heart of Singapore. Excellent to walk in with a lot of history in it. Connected to Clarke Quay and the Dhoby Ghaut area, it‚Äôs a must visit location.

I would say a visit to Singapore is incomplete without a walk in the park or with your family, a picnic"
,,Lovely quiet walk in the middle of a tourist spot!,4.0,,"Great little park in the middle of a busy tourist area. Loads of plaques and boards telling you about the long history of the hill and later fort. Research tour times for the ‚Äúbattle box‚Äù as we just missed the start of one tour and in truth were a little hot and bothered to hang around until the next tour. We now know the times and will be heading back to make sure we do it.
Something for everyone from spice gardens, archeology, ancient and modern history through to just sitting on a swing listening to the plentiful bird song and breathing in the aromas from the plants etc."
,,Stepping out of the metropolis,5.0,,"There is something very tranquil and pleasant about the park, it really does make you feel like you are clear from the buzzing metropolis of down town Singapore. With its Colonial history and Victorian like walkways, it also makes you feel like your back in the motherland!

On both occasions I've visited I've made a point of walking the complete perimeter, it offers good views of the city, the historic government building at the rear (now a hotel) and Singaporean life.

Notable points of interest include an old light house, various historic cannons, Battlebox (a must visit), the old (old) Fort, the visitors centre (useful toilet and cafe) and of course local wildlife and foliage.

But the main attraction for me was the quietness and tranquility it provides, the noise of the birds and the smells of the flowers, and reflection to understand where you are, and maybe how far you have travelled to get there!"
,,Relaxing at the top..Fort Canning Park,5.0,,"Fort Canning Park, an iconic hilltop landmark has witnessed many of Singapore‚Äôs historical milestones. The hill once sited the palaces of 14th century Kings and served as the Headquarters of the Far East Command Centre and British Army Barracks. The decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942 was also made on the hill, in the Underground Far East Command Centre, commonly known as Battle Box."
,,Step back in time to reveal the history of Singapore,5.0,,The good thing is you can walk through from Orchard Road to Clarke's Quay and begin to understand the history of Singapore. there is the WW11 Bunker which has huge significance to the fate of the colony in WW11. the trees and walkways provide a degree of protection from the sun and as you get closer to Clarke's Quay there is Raffles House and an intriguing Lighthouse overlooking the Singapore river
,,Nice park but not a must see,3.0,,This is a lovely park and well kept. However I wouldn't say it is a must see whilst you are in Singapore especially if you are on a tight time frame. The park is lovely if you like parks I did enjoy a little stroll around here but did not spend too long as there is much better things to do in my own opinion. However if you are a park lover then go.
,,Fort Canning Park,5.0,,"This beautiful park consists of attractive, well kept walkways, well labelled specimen trees and framed historical notes. Approached by an escalator from a lower level, it is an oasis sitting above the city
on a hillside, with lovely views East and West, as well as towards Marina Bay. Raffles's original house is situated here, but is undergoing renovation at present, and is closed off to the public."
,,Historic park worth an hour or two,3.0,,"This park is located on a small hill overlooking Singapore and contains a range of artefacts relating to the history of Singapore from the 13th to the 20th century. A pleasant diversion for a hour or two from busy Singapore.

Nearest MRT station is now Fort Canning on the Downtown line."
,,"Nice park, not a must see attraction",3.0,,"We enjoyed a stroll around the park, our main purpose was to find the battle box attraction but the park in itself is pleasant enough for a half hour stroll away from the hustle and bustle"
,,"Very popular area, especially on Sunday afternoons",5.0,,"Extensive and very popular green area.
This hilltop park has a remarkable history, including the military headquarters of Colonial Singapore and a ""Forbidden area"" . With a restricted area reservoir at the top, plus a very upmarket hotel and many acres of attractive formal gardens / ornamental woodlands.
During the weekends it is a very popular courting spot especially with many local and immigrant couples who remarkably seem very keen on horticulture and exotic plants in particular."
,,Nice spot in the city,4.0,,"It is OK with some very pleasant views given how close you are to the city life, but there are many more places in Singapore which I would put as higher priority ‚Äì such as Fort Siloso on Sentosa for the war experience. I did not do the Battlebox, could not be bothered to wait the time for the next tour when I was there."
,,Be prepared with water,5.0,,"Beautiful park full of lovely walks, though to reach many parts you need to climb quite steep hills and/or staircases. Lots of interesting trees such as Banyan trees and great deal of interesting finds throughout the park, including the Battlebox."
,,Great park with history,5.0,,Well preserved historical park in the middle of the city. Great for history buffs. It is a decent climb uphill
,,Go green,3.0,,"This park is big, you can access it from clarke quay or dhoby ghaut. From dhoby gaut you can walk thru the under ground tunnel which is cool."
,,Relaxing !,4.0,,"If you want to get away from the busy life of downtown you can enjoy this wonderful green area in the center of the city. Lots of locals jogging and walking. The place is well manicured with some attractions, buildings and hotels. It is about a 10 minutes walk from the hotel Fullerton. The main attraction is the battle box for the fans of WW2. It was the comnand center of the british army ! Dont miss it."
,,"Long walk with hill side, good for weekend",4.0,,My weekend has been well spent here. Managed to have long walk up and down. It is pretty difficult to find this famous view - but finally I found it where is just opposite to dhoby ghuat mrt statiom.
,,Gentle but hilly stroll with real interest,5.0,,Plenty to see in this park from the bunker to the archaeology. The park has lots of information boards to help you understand the history. And also the spice garden. It was serene and pleasant on the day I was there although the bunker was closed until 1.30 and I couldn't wait that late. I think it may be a bit of a challenge to anyone who has mobility concerns although I would recommend contacting them first. I really liked this place. Raffles house and the lighthouse were architecturally interesting although they were not open to go inside when I was there. Lots of heritage trees to see. I didn't go into the art museum as I was short of time but it was spectacular from the outside. It's a little oasis in the heart of a busy city. Some good views too
,,Nice Park,5.0,,"Lots of History here , lovely space to have a walk around waiting for your Battle Box tour to start. Interesting History of early settlement"
,,Picnics in the park.,5.0,,Great space to walk around . Excellent pathways and trees to view. Good art situated along the walkways along with plenty of great spots to picnic and just chill out. Love going down to the Battle Box also.
,,One of my favourite bits of Singapore,4.0,,"I always try and talk a walk in Fort Canning park when in Singapore. A raised hill on the edge of Clarke Quay, Fort Canning manages to combine the best elements of city views, a lush green park, and a number of informative historical attractions. Better in the evenings than during the day (it gets hot), it is well worth a stroll if you are out and about in the area during the evening."
,,evening walk - central location and quiet,4.0,,"i just discovered how lovely this place is in the evening when i came for a walk. within walking distance from city hall mrt station, it is easily accessible. the steps are a good work out. the area is full of interesting plaques and it is quiet. good place to come for a picnic as well. public toilets are clean and there are a few restaurants."
,,An outdoor huge park,5.0,,"The area were huge, with many attraction from Art Center, Restaurant, Field, and attraction. It was an outdoor so you should traveled light, have some food and drink on your little back, and use a comfortable shoes & clothes."
,,Morning walk,4.0,,"Headed to Fort Canning for our first stop in Singapore. Great for a morning stroll, we didn‚Äôt do the bunker tour, however the plaques and info scattered around were plenty for us."
,,Picturesque place,3.0,,"Quiet, Serene and picturesque. Perfect for a picnic and cooler evenings. Great for pictures. Families enjoy picnics here. Houses some good restaurants as well"
,,Exhibitions to see,4.0,,"I have seen at least two excellent exhibitions here, the last being the UNECSO World heritage lego exhibition. When visiting the park ensure to walk through the herb garden too."
,,Lots on inclines and steps.,4.0,,"This was a mammoth effort for me being the unfit person. Thankfully you can do it at your own pace and rest when needed. Nice place for gatherings, picnics, to chill out but also good to learn about history."
,,Fort canning park...,4.0,,"Fort canning park is located in singapore, agrassy hilltop which has got historical importance. It's an area where many concerts happen in the city. A museum and art centre is located nearby. From this place Clarke quay is nearby which is exactly opposite to the calm atmosphere around here. People will come here, exercising themselves, and spend there leisure time in a calm environment. Altogether it's a recommendable place for the travellers in singapore."
,,Great Bunker tour.,5.0,,I was amazed how enjoyable this tour was about the surrender of Singapore. Highly recommend this Tour.. Good suggestion is to go on the Earliest tour at 9.45am as we only had 8 people.The next tour had around 30.
,,Canning Park,4.0,,"Visited this park in the evening. It has quite a steep climb up to the main area of the park. The park is really vast & it will take you hours to cover up on foot but perfect for an evening walk. They do offer tours to the Battlebox, however we arrived just after the last tour. The tour is priced at SGD 18 for an Adult & are supposed to last a little over an hour."
,,Great Park,4.0,,A great park to go for a walk around and enjoy the peace full surrounds. Just of Orchard road a very easy place to get to.
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"The hardest part is getting here walking, quite steep from any direction, but rewards the effort. Probably best when combined with a visit to the Battlebox, but still a great way to pass a couple hours. Lots of history. Plaques highlight significant places and events over the last 700 years.The main lawn in front of the big building was a graveyard. The ""contents"" were removed, many of the headstones line the walls around it, and give a sombre reminder of the abbeviated life expectancy for Western during the 19th century."
,,Historical stroll,3.0,,A nice stroll in a public park overlooking the city. It was also the place of the Singapore allies command center during the battles of WW2. Unfortunately the Battlebox can only be visited through planned guided tours.
,,Great park with excellent city views,5.0,,"Right behind the Singapore Museum, I highly recommend the walks, the views, easy access to Clarke Quay. There are beautiful tree and old cemetery markers dating to mid-19th Century. I'm sure on weekends there are often great events presented here. Also, enjoyed the old lighthouse."
,,Huge,4.0,,"This park is huge, it even has areas that has escalators to make your walk less tiring. Its pretty, has a good history, its interesting."
,,Fort Canning Park & Battlebox Tour,5.0,,"Highly recommend the 2.5 hour tour. Our guide Shar(?) spoke excellent English & was very knowledgeable. Got a bit of history on Singapore , the war & even life nowadays for Singaporeans. Bonus was the delicious bowl of vegetarian biryani at the restaurant at Fort Canning Park. A fair bit of walking & the park is on a hill, but not too strenuous.
I don‚Äôt know if all the guides are as good as Shar, but he really made the tour."
,,TAKE A TOUR BUS,5.0,,"We WALKED up the Fort Canning Hill and then all around the Fort, interestingly they now have a Hotel on it , The Battle Box we did not go in as we were too early for the tour, Bus tour is the way to go, there are old 9 pounder Guns (2) , Raffles first home , Plenty of walking , take a Hat or umbrella."
,,"Iconic Hilltop History and Today, Art",4.0,,"A hilltop landmark, Fort Canning is the site of many of Singapore's historic milestones: The location of 14th century Malay Kings, home of the Commander of the British Army and place where Singapore surrendered to the British in 1942. Today, it offers a lushly landscaped garden, top end hotel and manicured lawns for celebrations: weddings, Shakespearean plays and art exhibits. Just a few blocks up the hill from Orchard Road near Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, Fort Canning is wonderfully quiet respite from the shopping crowds."
,,Fort Canning Park,5.0,,This park is on the hop on hop off bus route so we thought that we would hop off to investigate this well mainted gardens. Beautiful maintained gardens with paths that climb higher and higher when walking around on them. Not a good park to visit if you have trouble walking or a bit unfit. Well worth a visit
,,A great escaoe,4.0,,"The perfect place to escape the heat and tourist hotspots in the city. Easily accessible by the MRT or for us, was half an hour walk from our accommodation. Some great photo opportunities for those looking for something a little different."
,,Great Historical Interest,5.0,,Had a leisurely walking tour around this entire area after visiting the Battlebox. Well worth it for anyone like myself interested in Singapore's history
,,Another great green space in the city,4.0,,"I was in Singapore for a workshop, and we spent one evening strolling down Orchard Road. We just happened to find Fort Canning Park. It was a great place to relax. I'm a history guy, so I enjoyed seeing this fort from the colonial era. I wish there had been a few more signs to help the public get the full story of the place. Singapore is a dense and busy city, but the government does a wonderful job of providing green spaces like Fort Canning."
,,Steps,4.0,,"A beautiful, green hilltop oasis in the city. We cut through on our way to the train station. Be warned this place is hilly!! There are lots of steps to the top. A great place to exercise for sure! Wish we had more time to explore. Beautifully maintained."
,,Bunker guided tour a must,4.0,,"On top of beautiful Fort Canning Park you will find the bunker tucked away near the exit on the Orchard Rd side of the hill. Buy your tickets for the guided tour which is the only way to see inside. The young guide who conducted our varied group of about 15 people was professional, knowledgeable, measured in presentation and very personable. As she conducted us from room to room, a terrible tale unfolded of English capitulation to a clever and organised enemy that resulted in the taking of Singapore. Rooms contain old equipment and realistic representations featuring excellent Madame Tussaud-like historical figures which help bring the tale to life. A throughly enjoyable and informative one-hour tour that is well worth the admission fee. Visit it before you go to the Changi museum to give Changi a better historical perspective."
,,Lovely park,5.0,,A beautiful and well-maintained park. A haven of quiet in the middle of Singapore. Absolutely lovely.
,,Lovely and peaceful in the middle of the city,4.0,,"We have been to Singapore on multiple occasions and never walked through the Park. Not any more! It is very easy to walk around with great signage talking about the history of the park. Although you are right in the middle of the city, it is incredibly peaceful."
,,Interesting Gardens with a Lot to Offer,4.0,,I was pleasantly surprised at what the park holds for tourists. I was sorry that I didn't know about buying tickets for the bunker which looked well worth visiting but entry is by tour only. Perhaps next time. The gardens in Singapore City are amazing. They are a credit to the Singaporeans.
,,Safe and refreshing,5.0,,"Very beautiful place, full of green. Nice pathways , vintage buildings , historical place with information given everywhere. I enjoyed my jogging there. Can't wait to visit it again!!!"
,,A park with history,4.0,,A must stop for who want to get a little history of Singapore's days as a British colony. Or if you just want to relax and have a picnic. Just don't litter.
,,So peaceful place,4.0,,"Very nice and quiet place. Walking at Fort Canning Park is really relaxing. We learned a lot about the history of Singapore and about spices.
You can admire so many type of plants which can't see easily in your life.
Fort Canning is near City Hall MRT."
,,Shade & Breeze,4.0,,"We were looking for somewhere that had shade, and a possible breeze, in the heat of Singapore. Fort Canning Park was just 12 minutes walk away from our accommodation so became the place of choice. It is sited on a hill; we entered the Park up never ending stairs, but on exiting we found that there is a sloping pathway on the Clark Quay side of the park that is much less strenuous. You will find lush greenery, much of it providing shade with places to sit, and at least a gentle breeze - I understand that Stamford Raffles built a house up there just to get the breeze. There is a huge amount of history surrounding you and if that is what you are into it will keep you happy for a long time. We just enjoyed the slower pace away from the crowds and the tranquility it afforded."
,,Big Park with greenery view,4.0,,Hiltop landmark of singapore city. If you love exercise you should go for it. It's very spectacular view from underground tunnel. It's also best for family.
,,Battlebox well worth a visit.,5.0,,Having been to Singapore on a number of occasions over the years I had never visited Fort Canning Park let alone the Battlebox bunker. I took the one and a half hour tour of the Battlebox and found it was extremely well presented by our very informative and knowledgeable guide Jerome. Lifelike models of all the key military personnel are shown at various locations to give it a more authentic feel.The bunker is air-conditioned. No photos are permitted. Highly recommend this tour to people of all ages.
,,Trip back in time,5.0,,"Fort Canning is a lovely Park with a lot of history. The focus of our visit was on the Battle Box , a bunker which was built during WWII. The tour guide was very knowledgeable. This is a great tour for the WWII buff! We came away with an understanding of the War in Malaya and Singapore and why the British lost. The tour lasted 1hr and 15 minutes. The bunker is air-conditioned. If you are visiting the rest of the Park, go early in the morning as it can get quite hot. The Park has much more to see... Raffles home, the old barracks, etc. i recommend it."
,,Cool garden walk,4.0,,"Luscious green garden with plenty of history and interesting plants. Depending on where you enter, there are a number of stairs and it can be a little difficult to navigate some of the winding paths in order to reach your chosen destination"
,,Very nice Sunday morning in the park,4.0,,"I had a very enjoyable morning walk here on a Sunday. It is quite and you have time and inspiration for reflection as well as a very nice possibility to enhance your knowledge of Singapore history.
Many posters with information is placed around the walking path. Are you interested in botanical information this is also displayed and educating. You can also use the park for a run."
,,Fort Canning Parks is a nice tranquil setting in the middle of the city,4.0,,"Fort Canning Parks is a lovely place to visit. I wanted to do the Battle box tour, but when I saw all the step the I had to walk down I realised I could not do the tour with my bad knee. SO disappointed."
,,A walk on the wilder side,5.0,,"Right in the centre of Singapore and bordering some key city sights this ancient hill sports a reservoir and some hidden gems such as the BattleBox, the Fort Canning Hotel and an art gallery. The park is a pleasant walking area and so close to the main streets."
,,Big park and nice place,5.0,,Park here is quite big and clean. Many trees and green place also the nice point to take the photo..
,,The gem of a place,5.0,,"The place is amazing. Nicely tucked away in the busy Singapore city. It offers lots of insights into the history, a wonderful walk in the spice garden & a nice art center. On the weekend, there can be too many people around though."
,,OK park,3.0,,It is near National Museum. You will find the sign when you exit the museum. The park is known for the place where british surrendered to japanese.
,,Can miss it,3.0,,"If you are on a short trip to Singapore, you can miss this location. If on a long trip too, you can miss it. If you are on a really long trip and have already finished seeing everything else and/or if you live close, you can surely spend some time here - may be take a book along. Its green, serene and quiet. If you expect to find a ""fort"", I'd think you'll be disappointed. There's hardly any fort there now. I saw that some music concerts are conducted there but I wonder how one can enjoy music if one is being bitten by mosquitos constantly.
Tip 1: If visiting, please cover yourself well as it has many mosquitos, natural to a place that is full of greenery.
Tip 2: Combine this location with a visit to one of the museums."
,,Large greens,4.0,,"Large greens in the middle of the city, nice views from The Hill, and the battlebox to visit as well"
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"Me and the wife went on a long walk that started in Tiong Bahru and ended up here. It's set on the top of a hill and is surrounded by lovely tree's and greenery. Inside there is a lovely green where you will see most people hanging out, there are some amazing tree's to sit under and read a book like i did or the museum to visit. You can also go into the underground bunkers (I didn't) and see some of the old cannons and rooms.

It's a lovely place. I recommend it"
,,This park is worth taking time out to visit,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a nice tranquil place to visit, get away from the concrete jungle and take your time walking around the park, its situated close to the city which makes it convenient everyone can easily walk there. Allocate yourself at least two hours to see and take in what the park has to offer. Don‚Äôt worry about the heat as there is plenty of shade and rest stops."
,,Not to be missed if you are near,4.0,,"It was on our way and we didn't regret going through this nice free park. Coming from the North, you'll see a tourist office which will give you a plan of the park which is usefull."
,,A peaceful beautiful garden so close to the city.,5.0,,"This park area is well worth a visit with no time constraint. Firstly go to the battle box to book your tour through this historical monument as it is generally booked out if you turn up just before. This gave a fascinating look into the battle of Singapore. Then wander around the gardens and museum. Have a cup of tea in the Hotel Fort Canning in the charming ""bar"" area, a very pleasant experience."
,,Filled with History; Difficult to Navigate,3.0,,"I visited Fort Canning Arts Centre for the Piece of Peace world tour running from 27 July to 3 September 2017. The exhibition mainly consisted of UNESCO world heritage sites built with Lego bricks, but also had Lego MOCs made by Singaporeans, as well as tubs of Lego bricks for visitors to tinker with. Overall it was an interesting exhibition that kept me engaged for an hour, but I felt the lighting did not showcase the level of detail in some creations.

I also attempted to check out the historical artefacts in Fort Canning Park, but found the park very hard to navigate. I ended up visiting the nearby National Museum of Singapore instead."
,,Short visit,4.0,,"We walked up through the park stopping to view the lighthouse and Raffles house, then went down again to access Clark Quay. Lots to read, shady and cool even in the midday heat, I just wish we had had more time and my feet not so sore. I think we'll visit again on our way home in a few months!"
,,Great Park,5.0,,"The history of this park is amazing. Be sure to take time to enjoy the tropical flowers, and stop by the World War Two battery."
,,A great break from the crazy of Singapore,5.0,,"I love this park. When the hustle of Singapore gets a bit much, take a stroll through Fort Canning. It is amazingly calm and quiet compared to what is just outside the walls.
There are lots of little pockets of information and history located all the way around, mixed with some beautiful plants and flowers.
I would advise going in late afternoon, when the heat has died down a bit, and make sure you wear bug spray, not for mosquitoes but for other little insects that bite."
,,Beautiful green oasis with a fascinating history,5.0,,"If you want to escape the hustle and bustle of Singapore by getting back to nature or if you're a history buff, then Fort Canning Park is the place to visit. The park is situated on a steep hill immediately behind Clarke Quay, so is very central and easy to get to. It's a reasonable size and some paths have a steep incline, which may be challenging for anyone with mobility issues. My overall impression was of green lawns, lush plants and lots of trees. There are also some impressive historical buildings dotted around the park as well as the WWII underground military operations bunker, now known as the BattleBox Museum, which is well worth a visit to do the highly informative 1 hr guided tour. Guided or self-guided trails through the park range from 0.6-2km in length."
,,Reccomend a visit,5.0,,"This is where Singapore was surrendered to the Japanese in WW II so has an amazing amount of history but further back than WW II. It is in a beautiful park with well kept grounds and flower beds. There are lots of different area to look at such as herb garden, archaeology dig, war memorial, bunker and lots more. There is an art gallery in the park with a delightful caf√© in which I would definitely recommend - especially the sundae's which cost $9 and worth every cent. The girl who was there when we attended was lovely and made an art work of every piece of food which she produced. The caf√© itself is very small but delightful, definitely recommend this and Fort Canning."
,,Love this Park,5.0,,Fort Canning Park is a peaceful oasis in the bustling bust city. Plenty of walking paths to enjoy and pleasant gardens.
,,Battlebox - a must visit if you want to go back to the historical days,5.0,,"The Battlebox is a former British underground command center in Fort Canning Hill. Built in the 1930s, it was used by the-then army that defended Singapore during WWII.

A great experience that brings back historical days alive. Before entry you watch a video that gives you the glimpse of the history and then you walk inside across the underground command center. It gave me a scary feeling when I went inside and realized how the days of the war had been for people who lived in those days."
,,Lovely place for a walk,4.0,,"This park is lovely for a walk or picnic, and to watch the birds. There is lots of historic things to see in the park, the Battle box being one of them, please note that you have to book before at the office/shop in the park."
,,Former center of colonial rule in Singapore and a fascinating site,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is located on a hill across the river from Singapore's CBD and very near to Raffles Hotel. To see everything there is a fair bit of walking involved (lots of stairs and ramps), but it is well worth it with a range of different things to see including one of the original lighthouses of Singapore, the main former residence of the Governor from colonial times and also some archaeological ruins. My one piece of advice is to go early in the day before it gets too humid and hot"
,,Beautiful oasis in a busy city,5.0,,"Walking through the park you gorget you are in a very busy city. The park is beautiful with lots of greenery and places to just sit and relax and enjoy the scenery. It is also where you will find the Battlebox, the WWII bunker under the hill used by the British as their command centre, and also by the Japanese after the surrender of Singapore"
,,Gotta Get Those Steps In,4.0,,"Whew, walking up all the steps is a good workout on a hot and humid day. The trees are awesome and the paths are well groomed. We saw some wedding pictures being taken and enjoyed watching families picnicking under the shady trees."
,,Well preserved park area close to the city,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is well worth a visit whilst in Singapore, with plenty of walking trails and interesting historical data about Singapore. I often walk home through the park as an indirect alternative to the busy River Valley Road. Just have to be a little careful of the mosquitoes, but otherwise this place is great to visit. On weekdays it's virtually empty."
,,Well maintained 'green lung' in central Singapore,4.0,,"Situated on a hill the park has a number of well maintained walkways with lots of directional signage to find your way around - obtain an Informative Brochure from your hotel, an information center or as we did in the Arts Center in the park itself to make for an informed enjoyable visit - lots of historical buildings and outdoor sculptures - beautiful trees and well maintained gardens - also features the Battelbox with guided tours of the WW2 military headquarters prior to the Japanese occupation - should be on your list of places to visit if you have more than a couple of days in this beautiful city"
,,Fort Canning Park,4.0,,"Good place for morning or evening walk, right in town. Quite a big place if one is willing to just explore and walk around and enjoy the scenery plus enjoying the fauna around."
,,Well preserved historical buildings pleasant to visit,5.0,,Very well preserved Park with the old British war buildings including the battle box. Lovely to see the historical buildings and the gardens are so well maintained. It was not at all busy in the park when we were there (weekday morning) and very pleasant to stroll around. Be aware that there are quite a few stairs to climb as the park is elevated so if mobility is an issue then perhaps a taxi to the entrance better than using the MRT to get here.
,,For history buffs or if you like a nice park,5.0,,Fort Canning is a wonderful place to visit in Singapore. From the high vantage point is I found it to be quite tranquil. A wonderful spot just to sit and relax or learn more about Singapore through the history on display.
,,Beautiful park in the city,4.0,,A beautiful park in the city. Saw numerous people picnicking. It's quite and lovely and I came from Hill Street and climbed the stairs.
,,Great for a walk,4.0,,This is such an oasis in the city. It's a lovely open space to walk and easily connects to Clark Quay. There's lots of interesting historical bits of info. My only regret is I didn't get to spend enough time there.
,,The history of Singapore in 3 hours.,5.0,,"The hill on which Fort Canning sits has long been associated with the dominant political entity in Singapore. The tour gives a brief history of the site with a particular emphasis on the fall of Singapore during WW2. Our tour guide was very engaging and we had a wonderful afternoon. The tour includes a tours of the bunkers where the defence of Singapore was planned and ultimately where the decision to surrender was made.

Our tour guide made sure we were in the shade as much as possible during the outdoor part of the tour but Singapore is generally very warm so make sure to bring plenty of water with you."
,,A pleasant walk in the park,4.0,,This is the site of a historical British Military base from the days of empire. Wr walked around the extensive gardens where you can see a lot of rare botanical and arborial specimens in a sylvan setting.
,,Heartfelt experience,5.0,,Stumbled upon this historic place after climbing many stairs (we later found out there was an easier way of getting to this place)! Can not recommend this tour highly enough. Our guide Joanne was extremely informed and well spoken and brought the battle box to life. Changed my opinion on the surrender of Singapore and gave me goose bumps throughout the tour. Definitely worth setting aside 1hr and 15 mins to this guided tour.
,,Great Park Tucked into the city,4.0,,"Great art, bird watching, plant identification and all around a great place for a stroll just minutes from Clarke Quay and the National museum of S'pore. Worth a visit"
,,The park is great and the hotel is also lovely,4.0,,"The park is really well maintained and I found the hotel stunning too. The only setback is the steps. It feels grand but turns out to be a nuisance to walk all those steps in 4 inch heels if you plan on attending an event in the hotel or going for a meal. Otherwise, the food in the hotel was outstanding and I love the lush green surrounding. Almost like mammoth park in the middle of the city. Who doesn't like greenery?"
,,enjoyable,5.0,,"though all of Singapore is a park or a garden or a garden in a park, Fort Canning offers even more. There are historic buildings in it, public art, beautiful walk ways, a temple, botanical exhibitions and more. Don't miss it.
and don't miss the Battle Box"
,,Nice urban park,5.0,,Beautifully maintained park with some historic buildings set in it. Well worth a stroll around and also some great views of Singapore.
,,Amazing Park,5.0,,Amazing Park had a great time! Locals here are amazing people. It was refreshing to be in a beautiful quiet place.
,,"Quick, and beautiful walk",5.0,,"its up a hill, so you have to climb to it no matter where you come from. that said, it was some beautiful trees, and great life."
,,Romantic quite place for a walk,3.0,,We got married in Hotel Fort Canning so we are no stranger to the park which is a stone's throw away from the hotel. You will see couples taking wedding photos here too.
,,Lovely oasis in a busy city,5.0,,"Once you brave the climb up the incline in the heat (this is Singapore after all), the place is a real oasis.

Apart from the ever present sound of new construction, all you can hear are the jungle noises .

Wonderful trails around the water storage, well signposted and great views of the city.

Great place to get away from the hustle and bustle."
,,Historical Hill,5.0,,"This is a very interesting tourist site, with a rich history dating back 700 years ago, from when it was called Bukit Larangan or Forbidden Hill. It was previously occupied by Malay kings for their residences, then used by the British as governors' houses, and finally utilized as a military area until the Second World War.

Now it is a tourist spot offering many interesting facts for visitors to Singapore. My first trip to Fort Canning Hill caught my attention entirely as I also visited the Battle Box, the main underground facility of the Malaya Command where the surrender of Singapore in WWII was decided.

I discovered many things about Fort Canning Hill, thanks to the different informative boards spread out at strategic spots along the walking and jogging trails.

At many areas around the hill, you will have good bird's eye views of Singapore's central business district and entertainment areas, including Orchard Road, since you are on top of a 60-meter slope. Such a sight!

I enjoyed seeing many heritage trees about the park. It would have been enjoyable to approach the reservoir, too, but public access is currently not allowed. Other notable areas include Raffles' House, the Fort Gate, and a 9-pound cannon which was meant to protect the fortress from sea attacks.

You will definitely enjoy your visit to this park, because you won't just enjoy the sights, but also learn about the history of Fort Canning Hill."
,,Lovely spot,4.0,,"Take a few hours to walk through this park, not a major attraction but has somevery interesting features. Make sure you book onto the bunker tour, this was a fantastic guided tour through the bunker that played an important part at the conclusion of the Japanese invasion of Singapore. Lovely strolling paths through majestic trees. So glad we went."
,,Nice quiet cool place for a stroll,4.0,,"A true gem of a park right inside the city. Cool shaded walkways provide a relief from the hot sun. A few historical cannons, gates and underground bunkers to see. Well worth a visit."
,,Unexpected find,4.0,,I came across Fort Canning accidentally as I hadn't heard of it. What a discovery! There were so many unique 'finds' ranging from the Spice Garden to the Battlebox to the archaeological dig to the cemetery and the list goes on. While the pathways went everywhere throughout the 'forest' type areas and the open areas the signposting was a bit confusing at times. In a way though this added to the adventure as when tryin to get to a certain feature I'd stumble across a different feature that wasn't necessarily signposted to be where it was.
,,Cool spot for the hot days,4.0,,We found the Park a nice place to explore after arriving in Singapore as the weather was so hot & the park with its many trees offered a respite for a while. There are many paths to wander & of cause the fort itself to visit. Lots of interesting things to see including the only outdoor escalator I've come across & carved walls detailing history of the Island
,,"One of the best place to walk, run and relax",5.0,,"A wonderful green island in the middle of Singapore, surrounded by museums. It's both ideal for running (if you like the hilly tracks) and for secret dates during nighttime.

Also good place for relaxing under the enormous trees.

They have little botanic gardens, and many paths and stairs."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Absolutely beautiful park in the center of the city. There are so many huge trees, that must have taken years and years to grow to that size. This area was one of the key strongholds for the British army when they were fighting against Japan for sovereignty of Singapore. There are a lot of information boards which tell you about the history and some relics such as canons and lighthouses."
,,A nice place to visit and quiet.,4.0,,Put on your walking shoes take water grab a map and enjoy you visit. You have an old fort. Raffles built his home on the hill nice view of Singapore. Plenty of information boards. Nice place to spend a few hours.
,,feedback,1.0,,"I was there 5days and it looked nice but room service was really poor.
When I came out from room hotel smelled like grandmothers kitchen.

When I asked for umbrella, They didn't have.

There is LONG way to be on "" Good "" hotels list!

We spent 600 SGD for room service and 2 days later they came back with additional invoice 10,50 SDG.

Just doing international money transfer, it costs more!

Disappointed!"
,,An absolute delight for a walk,5.0,,"It is so lush and green, absolutely beautiful! There are so many huge trees, that must have taken years and years to grow to that size. Yet all this in the middle of the city."
,,Good for a day trip with the family,4.0,,"It's hot so wear a hat and sunnies, try and head over earlier or later in the day. Good for a family trip to walk around get a mini hike in going up the stairs."
,,Interesting but not a must see,3.0,,"This area was one of the key strongholds for the British army when they were fighting against Japan for sovereignty of Singapore. There are information boards which tell you about the history and some relics such as canons and lighthouses. The park is free to enter.

The real attraction around this area is the Battlebox museum, so if you want to find out more about the history of Singapore, I would really recommend this."
,,A Walk in the Park,4.0,,A nice tranquil park to walk around in the midst of a bustling commercial zone. A venue for open air concerts as well.
,,Beautiful place for an hour walk in a prime location,5.0,,"So close it is from Clare Quay but a beautiful garden walk. A hour walk was extended to more than 2 hours due to some nice showers. Like any other location in Singapore, we could manage the visit using the map that was self explanatory. It was amazing to see a few left-over Madras thorn trees. We had been to this place during end of May 2016, it was evening and end of it went for dinner in Clare Quay."
,,bit of a hidden gem,5.0,,"visit this area for peace and tranquillity. situated in the heart of city hall, accessible at various points. take a leisurely walk around the hill and enjoy."
,,Excellent morning stroll,5.0,,We arrived about 9.50 and setting in the Colonial self guided tour (downloaded the pdf). It said 45 mins but we spent 2 hrs wandering around ... it was great. Then we walked on down to the Raffles shopping centre and had lunch at the food court - $21 for 4 lunches!
,,Good walk in the park,4.0,,Walked from the hotel and a wee bit hot and sweaty around noon. Nice and quiet area showing part of Singapore's heritage in the early 1900's. Good area for jogging.
,,A calm oasis by the city centre,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a quiet oasis atop a hill immediately to the north of Clarke Quay. There are soaring rainforest trees, a spice garden, well sign-posted leafy walks and views over the city, and to Marina Bay. there are also fortifications, an underground former command centre and a characterless cafe deep inside the main building. The park is the thing. Well worth the short climb up the steps to the top."
,,Nice Public Park,4.0,,"This park is located right in the city, next to the National Museum. I had a nice relaxing walk and found many interesting ""free exhibits"" dotted around the park. There is even an archaeological dig up the hill. Worth a visit!"
,,Nice escape from the city,4.0,,There are plenty of trees and greenery here. The park is on a giant hill very close to the Singapore National Museum. I believe the fort itself was built in 1861. The old structures remain and are cool to see if you're a history buff.
,,"Good for a quick hour walk, some views",4.0,,"The loop around the park is a nice hour stroll. Longer if you want to visit the hotels or military museum. Being one of the new high points there are a few views. The various historical spots are well labeled (English only). Local plants well labeled.

Also an easy walk to many restaurants.

Not much shelter if the rains come."
,,Glad I spotted this park,5.0,,A bit hilly but many information notices detailing the history and sights to be seen within the park make this great. Get there in the morning when it is not too busy with tourists or too hot.
,,A wonderful park,4.0,,Worth a walk around to enjoy this lovely environment. The tropical trees and plants are beautiful and the park is very neatly manicured.
,,A history lesson in a lovely tropical setting,4.0,,"A fairly easy walk - for those used to the tropical climate. A must for history buffs, with several interesting landmarks. I particularly liked the Governor's House on the hill, where Sir Stamford Raffles once lived. A very peaceful place."
,,A beautiful walk,4.0,,This park is such a beautiful walk sourounded by manacured green gardens. The considerable number of steps to the top are the added bonus to your fitness regime. Raffles house shows how the original view has been covered by progress This walk is great
,,This is a fabulous place to spend a few hours and the Battlebox is a must.,5.0,,"I went to Fort Canning Park primarily to visit the Battlebox Bunker (See my separate review on this fabulous attraction and tour) but there is also plenty else to see in this fantastic tranquil hilltop park. Make sure you go and see the Old Christian Cemetery, The Spice Garden, the Keramat (the tomb of the first settler in Singapore - Iskandar Shah in 1390), the Gothic Gates and the old Fort Gate, and the old fort barracks which is now the Fort Canning Centre. This is such a history rich place and so peaceful too, well worth a visit for around 3 hours when in Singapore."
,,Make sure you have acclimatised first...,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a strange one - from the southern approach you are presented by a seemingly never ending set of steps, but take your time - the view is worth it from the top. The park contains the flagpole that was used to signify sovereignty - this is where the Japanese flag replaced the British flag after the fall of Singapore. Next to this is the original lighthouse for when the harbour was much closer to the hill before all the land reclamation. Behind this (and up more steps) is Sir Stamford Raffles' bungalow. The reservoir at the top of the park is restricted, but walk further and you get to the two huge buildings that used to be the barracks for officers and men of the British Army - now hotels. Between these is the remarkable Battlebox, where the defence of Singapore was managed, and the surrender finally agreed. In the rest of the park there are secluded shrines, huge and majestic Rain Trees, and a fascinating herb and spice garden. Well worth a visit if you want a quiet stroll as the park is usually pretty quiet (probably because of those steps!)"
,,A good place for a walk,4.0,,"We didn't realize there was an underground bunker tour that looked interesting. Beyond that it is a nice place to walk around in the morning or late afternoon on your way to Clarke Quay or the malls on Orchard Road. It is also right behind the Singapore museum, and it would be worth visit if you are going to the museum."
,,Not worth the 48th place in top attractions list,3.0,,"Its just a park to roam around for residents or locals. Not much to see for tourists, apart from the few good locations for photographs. You can skip this one, if you are on a short trip, or just go for an evening stroll if your hotel happens to be nearby, because it is very close to an entrance of clark quay."
,,Interesting park for walking,4.0,,"I pass through here quite often on the way home from work - a good way to escape the traffic and enjoy a bit of nature. Quite a few old buildings to see inside the park too, and now a lot more information on the history of Singapore also. In the early evenings on a weeknight the park can be quite peaceful with very few people around. But on the weekends it can be busy, especially if the weather is nice. Well worth a visit if you're in the vicinity."
,,Get into the park!,5.0,,A lovely lush garden visit to recharge after too much city. Just enjoy the beautiful surroundings and keep an eye out for squirrels.
,,Peaceful and well maintained,4.0,,This is a lovely quiet park in the middle of the city. It is steep in some places but worth the climb. We didn't realize that we had to pay to get into the Battlebox and unfortunately didn't have time to go on one of the tours.
,,Quiet and peaceful park,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park was easily accessible from our hotel, The Park Hotel at Clarke Quay, and we decided to make this our first port of call on a day of touring the city on foot. After climbing the steps to the top in the humid morning heat, the shade of the paths that wound their way around the hill were more than welcoming. It would have been nice if there were benches to sit, relax and enjoy the peace and quiet of the park, but we didn't manage to find any. We admired the towering trees and read the history of the lighthouse in the centre of the park, before descending the slope on the other side to continue with our walk towards Raffles Hotel."
,,Tranquility in the city,5.0,,Great place for some peace and quiet - relaxing park with lots of history. If you get the chance visit Battlebox - a must see Singapore attraction.
,,Solo walk in the park,4.0,,"Easily assessible by foot. There were some steps to climb, since it is up on a hill. But once you've arrive at the top, it's so peaceful and quiet. It calms your nerves.

Many places to stop by just to take a rest. Lovely ""swings"" for friends and families instead of the usual park benches (which are also available).

Breathe in the fresh air and take in the sights of Singapore scrapers.

I enjoyed it. I hope you guys too!"
,,Beautiful park in the middle of the city.,5.0,,"Great for walks or runs. Visited the battle box museum, where the surrender to the Japanese by the British was signed. Was very interesting."
,,Herbs garden,4.0,,An interesting place to see the different types of herbs that can be grown in Singapore. Most times we just buy from the shops.
,,Facinating visit away from the trafic and the crowds,4.0,,This hill fort garden area seams to get missed off from many tourist agendas but it is a super self guided place to spend two or three hours. Information boards throughout the park tell the story of the long history of this place and include the war years with the underground war rooms available to visit on a guided tour.
,,Battlebox WW2 bunker - thought provoking and informative guided tour,5.0,,Our guide Eisen really made this guided tour for us. He was very knowledgeable. The tour is about the final days of British rule as the Japanese came down through Malaysia and took Singapore in 1942 in only 55 days after landing 800kms away.
,,A green oasis in the middle of Singapore with lots of nature and a bit of history,5.0,,"Fort Canning Park is located very conveniently in the center of Singapore, right next to one of the major museums, near Orchard Road as well as within walking distance to Clarke Quay. There is some marvellous vegetation to be seen, along with some signage as to what you are looking at. There is a Visitors Center and a 'Battle Box', which explains WW II from an Asian point of view. Very well made and interesting! One one side is a row of very old gravestones, as this site served as a cementery for a while. You could go to this park for a picnic, if you're comfortable with the humidity!"
,,Oasis in the city,4.0,,"Visiting park in the foreign city is one of my favorite activity, fort canning was the nearest park to my hostel at that time, i visit at weekday and almost at noon, but because the park is so full of big tree i didn't feel the heat at all, by the name of the park you can tell you have to climb a little and break a little sweat... There are several monument and the building nearby have art exhibition at that park, overall this is one of my favorite park in Singapore :)"
,,Took an evening stroll with the wife,3.0,,Not as pleasant as Pearl Hill though but plenty to experience on spices; fruit plants; vegetations; generally you can learn a fair bit from just walking around the park. We were not going to the museum but just wanted to see what's in the park.
,,A little oasis in the centre of Singapore,4.0,,"Situated on a hillside, so you will have to do a bit of climbing. this park is well worth a visit for an hour or two. There is some interesting historical information around the site, some contemplative pieces of art and lots of interest for the horticulturalist. Particularly liked the new herb garden, with all specimens impeccably labelled. The whole site is really well maintained and very clean. It's very popular with locals on a Sunday who like to picnic"
,,Nice area in middle of the city...,5.0,,A really nice location for a walk and despite not being the biggest park it is full of wonderful information regarding the history of the area and the park in general. Be mindful that if a storm is coming its not wise to go into the park as it tends to get hit by lightning!
,,Historical Information,4.0,,Great place to take the family and enjoy walking through nature while getting some history at the same time.
,,"Very pretty, be prepared for the stairs",4.0,,"Beautiful and peaceful. Lots of stairs to climb on a hot day, so we really enjoyed the cold gelato at the Raffles house!"
,,Truly lovely park,5.0,,"Whether you want to stroll, walk the dogs or go for a jog, the park is perfect with shady paths, lovely trees, historical fort walls and the BattleBox to visit."
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,The Batle Box tour is a must do if you are interested in the history of Singapore. The 90 minute guided tour is informative and just walking through the former central command headquarters for the British and Allied Forces in the last days before the fall of Singapore is fascinating. You can book the tour through the kiosk in Fort Canning Hill park and the tour guides clearly have a passion for the history of Singapore providing our group with plenty of anecdotes and getting us to think about the events that shaped history. We followed our tour with a stop for the high tea at the nearby Fort Hill Hotel which was the former HQ for the British forces. An amazing place to step back in time.
,,Fascinating tour,5.0,,"The tour is an intriguing insight to Singapore's fall during World War II. The information presented and the displays offer an excellent depiction of the final days before the Japanese invasion. Our tour guide, Eisen, was impeccably informed and knowledgeable. Certainly worth a visit for those interested in history and an insight to Singapore's heritage."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"So much of Singapore's history is linked to the lovely site. The gardens are picturesque, this is a truly lovely place for a gentle stroll on the beautifully maintained paths."
,,"Greenery, shady and tranquility",5.0,,"I attended a Hindu ceremonial wedding at a temple nearby and strolled my way to this park after the wedding lunch. It was scorching hot that afternoon but the lush greenery of the park provided the natural shade for my relaxation.

I had not been here for a long, long time. But the tranquility and serenity in the neatly sculptured park was seductive and sedative. For a moment, I drowned myself in that moment of peacefulness. I heard the bird chirping, saw a butterfly among the flowers admired the historic architecture of the symbolic lighthouse and nearby monumental structures that survived since the British days and through the Second World War. I saw newly wed couples poised for photography in the beautiful gardens outside the Registry of Marriages.

It was away from the hustle and bustle of the city but this hidden gem of oasis is located right in the city. I love this park, love the tranquility and enjoy every peaceful moment in her greenery."
,,Singapore Culture,5.0,,"You can just walk around and take in the tranquility, its set on a hill so a bit of a climb but well worth it. The Battlebox is located inside the park as well. Refreshments are available."
,,Beautiful park and historical sights,4.0,,"Fort canning park is accessible from many areas, we got there via Clarke Quay, and there were a few works on the edge of the park where they are making a new SMRT area i believe. If you are keen there are a lot of steps or you can wander along the paths. For people with disabilities, maybe catch a cab to the top and skip the climb."
,,Enjoyable run path in the city. Don't miss the Battlebox tour!,5.0,,"Enjoyable run path in the city. Went there for morning runs couple of times with sets of stairs ideal for hike training.

Don't miss the Battlebox tour. It's a guided tour on underground bunker used in WW2. We had Mel as our tour guide. She did an amazing job! Would definitively visit fort canning park again!"
,,Battle Box Tour - a deep dive in history,5.0,,Under Fort Canning Park was the British underground bunker built in the lead up to the Second World War. We undertook a 90 minute guided tour that last close to two hours. The focus of the tour is the part it played in the lead up to the surrender of Singapore in1942. The facility is being developed to allow self guided tours in the near future. An amazing insight into a significant point in Singapore's history
,,Such a huge place to walk..,5.0,,"be prepared to walk 1-2hrs, good to exercise as well hehehe =) nearest MRT to alight is D.Ghout MRT station.. its just 8mins walk from Fort Canning Park, try to be here before 6pm if not it will get pretty dark by 615pm or so... Unless your together with a partner or friends ya. For myself I went solo for a brisk walk, so as I took my own sweet time tho... =')"
,,Beautiful Park in the City,5.0,,The park is huge and has a lot of historical sites and information inside. Great place to relax and lots of photo op as well. Beautiful place. The Registry of Marriages is also located here.
,,"Peaceful, beautiful park",5.0,,Good for a nice quiet walk under the trees with several historical artifacts place along the way. Relax and learn about some of Singapore's history. Since it's on a hill you will also get some nice views over the city.
,,A peaceful oasis,5.0,,"Fort Canning Park is great as both a place to relax and also to learn about Singapore's history. There is the Battle Box and the archeological dig site, plus the walls and cannons of the actual Fort Canning.

The only frustrating thing about Fort Canning Park is that there aren't really any options for eating in the park, so either don't come at lunch time or bring a picnic.

We always enjoy our visits to Fort Canning - but do remember the mosquito repellant!"
,,Fascinating tour and wonderful staff,5.0,,"Having been disappointed that the Old Ford factory ( Japanese headquarters) was closed for refurbishment and having no time to go to Changinmuseum, I only had an hour to indulge my love of ww2 history. But it was well worth it. Brilliant story telling and reveals by the tour guide and a real sense of the predicament of Percival. Staff charming about my amateur knowledge from films and books - Tenko, a town like Alice and the rising sun. Loved the myth busting they save until the end. Would be great to see them build on this and add sections on the occupation."
,,The Battle Box,5.0,,The Battle Box had re opened since my last visuit to Fort Canning. The battle box was the underground military head quarters build into Fort Canning and used during the world war two. Book the one hour tour and listen to the fanatstic tour guides summary of the capitulation of all allied forces too the Japanese.
,,Peaceful walk.,5.0,,If you don't mind a few steps you should definitely take a wander through this park. I recommend you take an umbrella on a hot day to ward off the sun and extra humidity from over hanging greenery.
,,"Quiet, beautiful park with lovely trees",4.0,,"Beautiful nature in Singapore. This park was lovely we walked through it before heading to Orchard road. Peaceful and filled with beautiful trees. If you are in the area, do take a walk around it. We visited in Jan 2015 but cannot change the year."
,,Lovely park to visit or go for a jog,5.0,,"Such a great park to visit for a quiet walk, a quick jog or visit one of the many events that are being held here. Over the years we've seen Snow Patrol, Neon Lights, Films at the Fort and a few Shakespeare's here and the location never disappoints."
,,Quiet oasis,5.0,,"This park is a quiet oasis in the middle of Singapore. A lot of green, many interesting plants. Make sure to visit the spices and herbs garden where you'll find a lot of explanations to all the different plants. Nice to spend some time there."
,,Nice walk in the park,4.0,,"Made my first visit on 25th Nov 2016 after 30 years.
Enjoyed my walk with a group of friends exploring the spice garden and the Archeological Dig Exhibition site. We found out how rich Singapore history was back in those days.

We also saw the replica of the Fort Canning light house which is no longer in use now.

Great place to bring our children to share with them about Singapore in the old days."
,,Interesting History,4.0,,Enjoyed a couple of hours walking around Fort Canning Park. Well worth a visit. Make sure you see wall with the carvings.
,,Good for a visit,4.0,,"Open space, lush green gardens with plenty of history to read about right across the hustle bustle .."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"If you take my route up the hill on a hot day, you will probably perspire a little as well. But, it's well worth the effort. There are beautiful trees and plants, ponds and wildlife, not to mention some lovely buildings, with information notices galore. The views from the hill aren't special - it's not that high, but there is plenty to keep people like me snapping away within the park. The art gallery looked particularly good, but sadly it was closed."
,,Brilliant Battle box tour,5.0,,"After enjoying a wonderful walk around this superb park we learnt of the guided tour, scheduled throughout the day, of the Battle Box - a museum to remember the surrender of Singapore in WW11. We paid a small fee for the 1.30pm tour which lasted one hour twenty minutes. This must have been the biggest bargain we had all the holiday! WOW that guide really brought the events to life and gave us every detail possible - he was excellent! The inside of the Battle box is very well laid out and a lot of hard work has gone into recreating the rooms, equipment and models to enhance the information given by Eisen Teo our wonderful guide. This is a must for anyone visiting Singapore."
,,Not everything here was lost.,4.0,,"The park is famous as the location of the Battle Box ‚Äì the location in which the decision was made to surrender during World War 11. The Park is an impressive collection of buildings including the National Museum of Singapore, the Fort Canning Park Hotel, an excavation site and several other interesting little spots. These are connected by an extensive walk-way and lots of fresh gardens including some magnificent old trees."
,,Jungle in the City,5.0,,You can walk around or over Fort Canning hill. The sounds of the City are rapidly lost as you enter the trees and the noise of the jungle predominates. Not surprisingly it is hot and humid and depending on where you are there are quite a few steps to climb.
,,Really nice place to go checkout,4.0,,"Steeped in history this Fort has canons, gatehouses under ground bunkers you can explore and archeological dig. The paths that wind up and across this park like area are beautifully kept and offer great views and lots of fauna and wildlife. There are lots of different areas to this park, play grounds, spice gardens & sculptures you name it and it pretty much has it.
Really enjoyed walking through here. Nice surprise and well worth a visit."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"We found ourselves with a morning to fill before leaving Singapore and having checked out of the hotel we made our way to Fort Canning Park. We were surprised by what we found, the history, the pleasant walks and the various trails you can follow. We really enjoyed the history,trying to look to the harbour through overgrown trees and trying to visualise how things were when the habour was open and very busy.

There's the Terrace,the lighthouse, the walks to the Battlebox museum, which we didn't go in due to time constraints but looked really interesting and then past Fort Canning Green. We had an excellent time."
,,Remnants of WW2,4.0,,Take in the sights of some of the areas which were fortified in preparation of the Japanese soldiers coming towards this part of the island. Spot the keramat and cannons still in placed. A walk into Singapore's history.
,,Peaceful park,5.0,,Just a short distance from all the hustle and bustle of Singapore the park is well worth a visit. Picturesque views are available with lots of trees and birds.
,,Calling nature lovers!,4.0,,"Take a break from the hustle of Singapore and enjoy the delightful Fort Canning Park. Walk around and check the various sites in the park including the Spice Garden, Sally Port and the Old Christian Cemetery, or take a break and chill out on Fort Canning Green. Popular with locals and tourists alike, a stroll around Fort Canning Park is a must on when in Singapore"
,,A morning jog under shades of trees.,3.0,,I went here to do my morning jog as it is located near my hotel. The area has a circle jogging track. A bit creepy while you reached a place called Keramat. I think I will take another route instead og going into the park.. :)
,,If you love walking...thn you should visit this,4.0,,Fort Canning Park provides an excellent walk for nature lovers with rare trees and plants across the park...it is quite well maintained and clean and becomes really nice just after the rainy season. You can enjoy the colonial architecture and has lots of information on WWII. A must visit but go there only if you have minimum 3-4 hours to spare. If you are tight on your schedule thn avoid it.
,,the beautiful architecture,4.0,,"There's a guided tour if you are interested in knowing more about the WWII battlebox. Singapore has once been occupied by the Japanese and this should be a good tour to know about how the departed has fought in protecting it. For me just to look at the architecture already makes my day. One of the buildings have been converted to a museum. You also get to see the Hotel Fort Canning which is a very common place for wedding ceremonies and banquets, as the registry is just a walk away. Walk a few more minutes down the road and you'll get to visit the Philatelic Museum,"
,,Interesting,4.0,,We very much enjoyed our visit that included a guided tour of the WW II Battlebox. The tour was a little over an hour. We left with a good understanding of the fall of Singatore to the Japanese in World War Two.
,,"Amazing experience, lots of information and great setting",5.0,,"Amazing experience Lots of information on boards around the park Also, a peaceful setting with great views of Singapore. Great place to chill out"
,,Good relief from the crowds in a historical setting,4.0,,"The closest park to the city centre and has a lot to offer but again like most of the other parks,it would take quite a long time to cover it all. That's hard to do in the heat. Best to get a flavour or take one particular aspect and just visit that area. There are quite a lot of shaded areas and places to sit and relax but you start to crave air con and the shops on Orchard road may be calling. Hard to get the impression of how it would have looked all those years ago before the development of Singapore because the sea is a lot further away and all the skyscrapers are now in the way."
,,Ordinary Garden,3.0,,We visited this place in the evening when it was dark. Just an ordinary garden and did not enjoy much. Though the garden is huge and we walked a lot in the garden.
,,Very nice walk in the city,5.0,,"Walked through the park at night time, beautiful views from the top and some beautiful structures and artwork scattered throughout. Probably not a must do while in Singapore but was a lovely stroll after dinner!"
,,Still as nice,4.0,,The last time I visited this place was >13 years ago. It's really well maintained even though >13 years has passed. It is pretty accessible as it's close to the start of Orchard road. This is where Singapore's history comes alive and is a great place to escape from the city.
,,The headstone wall at Fort Canning Park,4.0,,"We were walking through Fort Canning Park en-route to Peranakan Museum and we came across these headstones in the walls, which were a fascinating read on times gone past.

It's a lovely park and I only saw a small bit of it, it seems there's a bit more to see when I return next time."
,,Relaxing walk,5.0,,"Walking around in this area on my way to the Battlebox museum, I was pleasantly surprised to come across some beautiful trees from all around the world.Set around the reservoir in the heart of Singapore,it is well worth the visit"
,,Easy access for chill out,4.0,,"Once entered the park, the vibe suddenly changed. It suites for a quick escape from hectic urban life. It takes less than 5 mins walking from Dhoby Ghaut MRT stn or opposite Clarke Quay bus stop. Minus 1 star from overcrowded coz it is famous among tourists and pre-wedding photo-shooting."
,,Nothing to Shout About,3.0,,"Fort Canning Park, as with many local attractions, is small and quaint and really worth visiting if:

(a) you have a lot of time to spare, or
(b) you are visiting the very informative National Museum of Singapore next door, or
(c) you would like a quite place to run or exercise or take a walk in the middle of the Central Business and shopping districts of Singapore, or
(d) you just want to cut across from Dhoby Ghaut to Clarke Quay."
,,Interesting park,4.0,,Well maintained park with interesting trees and historic sites - all well maintained with informative signboards. I particularly enjoyed the historic ones and the archaeological dig site
,,Very interesting,5.0,,I can't believe they don't have more visitors. The number let under the park went untouched for so long apparently and is now interesting for anyone wanting to know about the fall a Singapore in WW2
,,Nice Park,3.0,,Is on a hill so lots of steps and slopes. Like all of Singapore it's well maintained. No playground that we could find just some adult swings. Battle Box is worth doing for some war history.
,,Beautiful Historic park,4.0,,"A beautiful and historic park in the city centre, lovely to visit and explore. The site is hilly and has lots of ramps and steps, but also houses several of the old barracks buildings, fort gates and various little historical gems as you explore."
,,Beautiful Park,5.0,,"Stumbled upon this park by accident and was pleasantly surprised. This park has a great mix of beautiful scenery with historical significance. When we explored it on a Thursday afternoon it was completely empty, perfect for taking some great photos. Worth a visit!

In summary:
Such a nice park. Check it out."
,,Very Nice,5.0,,Lovely place to visit but be prepared to walk and there are loads of steps. Very humid walking through the park make sure you have plenty of fluids with you
,,"Serene, Beautiful & Historic Park",4.0,,"Fort Canning is the hilltop site of previous Singapore Kingdoms, the site for The Battle Box, and also the site of Fort Canning. It is now a lovely hill top park popular with locals and tourists alike.

The original entrance gate still stands and there are many paths to explore.

Well worth a visit!"
,,Scenic and serene,4.0,,"Reminds me of city parks in most developed countries, like Hyde park in London etc. Except smaller, but worth a visit for the sites and snapshot of Singapore's history. Free & right in centre of city."
,,Great walk,5.0,,"Been here every time I come to Singapore as I love the walk - great views, so much history to see and big old trees with many different birds and butterflies to observe. Just right length of time to complete a circuit with a five year old!"
,,Refreshing and beautiful park!,5.0,,"I went to this place for a trip and it was wonderful! It was a beautiful place with great scenery. There was a lighthouse and the flagpole which was necessary in the olden days. The tour guide enlightened us about the history of the place. There were excavation sites and stuff for us to see, and the house in which Raffles and Farquhar lived in in the past. The greenery was beautiful -- there was also a chicken there! There are swings and stuff, and a big, beautiful field where we played games. It is also rather suitable for a wedding photo (there was a couple there)!"
,,Historic Hilltop,3.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a prominent hill in the heart of modern Singapore City. From the earliest times it was considered important and was the home for the early sultans' palaces.

During the British Colonial era a fort was built for the defence of Singapore, but only the fort gateway and remnants of some fort walls remain.

The main attraction there now is the ""Battle Box""' an underground bunker system which was the headquarters of the British Army Command at the outbreak of World War Two. It was here that General Percival and his senior allied officers and staff officers directed the final stages of the Defence of Singapore against the Japanese, and eventually made the decision to surrender."
,,A place where the past meets the present,5.0,,"One of the most beautiful parks in Singapore. If you will be in the city don't miss a chance to take a walk here. It was one of the first place where British landed in 19th century (at that time Fort Canning named as Government hill) and built there a fort with an armory, barracks and hospital.

Nowadays this place look like a peaceful and quiet oasis in the centre of Singapore but it is still fraught with the past and the history of those days. One of my favorite place - memory wall which was a part of old christian cemetery. This is absolutely amazing place which silently keeps a history of the Europeans, who once by chance or by life circumstances lived in Singapore"
,,Great walk,4.0,,"The park is stunning, the information boards that are dotted around make the walk even more enjoyable. A history lesson and a walk all rolled into 1."
,,Green lungs !!,3.0,,"Park overlooks the Clarke Quay and amazing views of Singapore river can be seen. Good Place to relax, unwind or simply sit and enjoy !!"
,,Breathe in the city's clean air,5.0,,"Back in February this year, we stayed at a serviced apartment just across from the park.
Just looking out every morning to Fort Canning was like a big boost to my morning spirit. So green, serene and lush.
Then one day, i decided to climb the stairs. Without a map, i did not get lost for long. The signposts are clearly marked the areas. Besides, what can be bad about getting lost in a lil pretty park, right? Well, the park or (fort) is bigger than i originally thought based on the view from our apartment windows. And it has caves! It's like a big kids lil jungle :)
Saw some local and expats using this park as their outdoor gym, for the stairs, and paved and lush walkways are long and well maintained, as every public facilities in this island/ state. It's a must visit for free things to do when you're in Singapore."
,,walking,3.0,,"The History of the country is here in this area. It is right in the middle of the city, high above everything else. The old historic walls seem to show respect for all they saw. As you climb up the steps you move away from the city sounds and absorb the feeling of what this area once stood for. It is a lot of walking. You do need to plan so you are well prepared of where you enter and where you get out of. It has multiple entries and exists. You can do it at your own pace on multiple days"
,,A park must visit when you are near Clarke Quay,4.0,,"If you are near Clarke Quay and have got some time apart from other attractions, must visit this different park in Singapore."
,,Visit to Fort Channing Bunker,3.0,,"Visited the bunker on holiday recently, guided tour the only option (about 1.5hrs). I felt the script of the tour to be very negative and somewhat factually incorrect. It needs to be re-written to give the correct balanced view. Very much the emphasis was on the British just surrendered and we were left in this situation ..... when in reality the Japanese had cut off all water to Singapore and bodies were rotting in the street! The UK were fighting in the four corners of the world let's not forget, and to stop the loss of anymore civilian life and to be able to bury the dead, was a huge factor in the surrender. Not wishing to give a history lesson, but please give a more balanced view and re-write your script!"
,,Great for an afternoon walk,4.0,,"If you are a WWII buff, this is a great place for an afternoon walk. There are various sites to see, including an archeological dig, the Battle Box underground bunker, an old cannon and various memorials"
,,Battle Box Tour,5.0,,"You have to book a tour of the Battle Box, it is not open for people to wonder round. This is great as the tour was absolutely fascinating. Excellent tour guides and other staff. The command centre has been excellently preserved/recreated. A must for anyone who wants to understand history. which is everyone. And a great tribute to the under resourced garrison..
The park is beautiful and calm."
,,A must see when touring Singapore,4.0,,"Don't leave this one off the list when touring Singapore, a great place to visit and experience some of the history of Singapore. Don't miss Fort Canning. Enjoy."
,,Battle Box tour and Fort Canning Park,4.0,,"We were the only two people on this tour which was led by Sean. It will be of interest to anyone with a knowledge of WW2 history and give a good insight into the reasons for the surrender to the Japanese. We found Sean to be very well presented, courteous and had a good knowledge of his subject. It was nice and cool underground. Would recommend anyone walking to the park have a supply of water with them. Another day we took a walk around the park. A small area was fenced off because of an event taking place but the rest of the park is worth the walk."
,,Heart of the city,4.0,,"Fort canning is easily accessible from many locations. As a park, it is quiet and well-maintained, with many schools using it as a venue for bonding games and activities. There are also other attractions within, such as the Battlebox, but you will need to pay for access. There are a lot of areas to walk around, so its good for relaxation and getting in touch with nature."
,,Nice place for a walk in the city,4.0,,"Singapore lacks green spaces. If you are looking for a park in the city, Fort Canning is the place to go.

It is a hull so there are some slopes but it has some historic markers since it was the centre of governance in the 14th century and also the residence of the British governor.

There is a keramat located there, plus a bunker museum and also a archeological dig site. It is also a site where concerts are held.

Do visit if you like parks but so bring sun screen and water. It is also a great place for a jog."
,,Battle Box,4.0,,A very informative tour detailing why the allies had no choice but to surrender Singapore to the Japanese (despite Churchill's orders to fight to the death).
,,Film @ Fort Canning,4.0,,Beautiful place to watch a film under the stars. Please go to Film @ Fort Canning to buy your tickets! Well worth it!
,,Green oasis in the city,4.0,,A lovely park but best visited early as it was very hot in the afternoon. I found it peaceful to be surrounded by mature trees in the heart of the city. Close to the National Museum and an art gallery which was closed on the day I visited.
,,"A Hill full of History, Heritage and Stories",5.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a historic place not to be missed and it showed stories from the 14th Century right up to the independence of Singapore in the 60's. From the Cannons to the Fort Wall to the Quartermaster's Rest area and not to mention Battle Box, this place will bring you through what Singapore has gone through for the last 600 years. Do not miss out on the Fort Canning Lighthouse as well. Definitely a place for the History Buffs."
,,Very relaxing park in central Singapore,4.0,,"Right across from Clarke Quay busy area, Fort Canning Park is a relaxing oasis of green lush vegetation. It is quite a walk up the stairs, but you can take the mechanic stairs situated on the side of the National Museum. The park is great for a walk and has a few historic landmarks. It also hosts regular cultural activities like Shakespeare in the Park. It's a very nice park to enjoy for jogging as well. It is close to the national museum on one side, to Clarke quay on the other side, to the historic fire station as well and Dhoby Gaut and Orchard on the other side."
,,"Peaceful, beautifully green oasis on top of the hill. Great vantage point to see Orchard Road.",4.0,,"The fort is open for tours however we just missed the tour of the underground bunker. Rather than wait for the next one we took a leisurely walk around by ourselves. Appreciated the old gates and walls of the historical fort. Also appreciated some beautiful old trees with tree roots reaching down to the ground like in the mangroves. It was peaceful and quiet except for the sounds of birds and cicadas, and easy to just lose oneself in the greenery and forget that we were surrounded by the city."
,,Battle Box,5.0,,"If you need to remove yourself from the crowds, then a leisurely stroll around Fort Canning is a must. Open space, lush green gardens, with plenty of history to read about along the way.
The newly reopened Battle Box, in which the allies used as the control centre, in the lead up to the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942, is a must for history buffs. This vast under ground bunker, has been recreated to resemble the final moments of the invasion. Complete with wax manikins of the military personnel.
This tour is guided only, and is very informative."
,,Worth a long walk through,5.0,,This hill is worth the effort it takes to walk up. There are stairs and paths which have lovely sculptures and information signs all the way along. The fort is interesting with easy access. The street level is just as lovely and full of interesting plants and a lovely cafe area.
,,Nature in the heart of the city,5.0,,"Let's get away the boring must do stuff for this trip... bring bug spray AND spray liberally!!! Those mozzies are commando trained! Bing wet wipes or towels to wipe/wash off bug spray and sweat after your walk in the park. Bring water. It gets really hot after a short time. Bring a change of clothing. Bun up your hair. Bring a cap. Apply sunscreen. You can afford not to bring anything... BUT BRING THE BUG SPRAY!!! I would recommend those with deet in them! In the event you do get bitten (whether at Fort Canning or anywhere else), buy ""Mopiko"" Cream. After bathing. Apply to the bitten lumps and heat the itch away with a hairdryer blowing on the itchy patches.

Let's get down to the real thing now... The flowers and the trees are absolutely beautiful and lovely! The scenery is wonderful as well. They have tours towards the last 2 weeks of each month and lots of activities too. Check out the website for more information - https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/fort-canning-park. If you do go for one of the guided tours (which are by volunteers), you HAVE to select Yap Tat Ming - absolute delight! His stories and knowledge about the history of Fort Canning and the plants will amaze you and leave you wanting more. A definite MUST go."
,,Great escape,4.0,,If you are in the area it provides a nice escape from the business around. Beautifully kept all around with the museum and garden to get aqcuainted with local history and greenery.
,,"Great for the history Buff, or interested tourist",4.0,,"A lovely walk around the hill if you don't want to go inside the bunker. But for history buffs or the inquisitive tourist, a visit and tour of the army bunker is a must."
,,A nice walk,4.0,,"A small park, very central and easy to find. It is a nice place to take a relaxing walk in the middle of the burst."
,,Nice Historical Park,4.0,,"Nice walking through the old historical park, many parks like this are in Singapore really nice to escape from the busy city live."
,,Steeped in WW11 history,4.0,,"If you have read up on the surrender and occupation by the Japanese forces in Singapore during WW11 the a visit to the battle box within Fort Canning Park is a must, the area whilst very hilly is home to some fantastic trees and vegetation, the trails are well sign posted and the trees are mostly identified by their type making it a pleasant and interesting walk"
,,"Nice for a short run, nice views on the colonial pat of Singapore",4.0,,Fort Canning Park is easily accessible from Dhoby Ghaut SMRT Station and offers views on the colonial part of Singapore. It is great for a short run.
,,Every time you turn a surprise,5.0,,"Quite simply, it is the history of Singapore in one place. Every time I turned a corner I found something new -- a sculpture, a historical marker, a wonderful view. My favorite view in SIN is from the raffles house, looking towards the old Supreme Court, with the Marina Bay Towers in the distance."
,,Stunning views,5.0,,"A strenuous walk up to the top but so worth it, beautiful greenery all around the park, very shady. Most of 'rest benches' along the way"
,,Good green-lush walk with some bonuses,4.0,,"If you are staying on and around Orchard Rd and thinking of spending an hour or two for a morning walk plus, do consider a route via Fort Canning Park.
A bit hilly with lush greens and nice breeze.

It has several scenic spots to drop by: the spice garden, the picnic terrace, the raffles terrace, the gothic gate, etc.

You might want to finish off in the The Fabulous Baker Boy at the other side of the hill for a coffee and some sweets/ cakes. Or you can go across the River Valley Rd to Clark Quay/ Liang Court area for even more food/ drink choices."
,,Nice mix of history and art surrounded by greenery,5.0,,"Had a quick walk around the park during a break in a conference I attended at Hotel Fort Canning. Realised I needed more time to explore this brilliant park that has arts, history and also an educational walk through a herb garden. Definitely coming back here."
,,Beautiful and Informative,4.0,,"We visited this park as we could see it from our hotel room and it looked beautiful.

This park is well maintained, beautiful and green. There are history information boards along the pathway giving you information about the discovery of Singapore, the grounds and buildings etc

It would be a good place for a picnic, unwinding and for those wanting to find out a little about the history of Singapore. Good place/space to bring younger children if they need timeout from a hotel room or shopping mall.

Tip: wear mosquito repellent"
,,Walk at the park,5.0,,"We were staying nearby and decided to have a walk here. The map looked big but the actual place is relatively small. They have big trees and green surroundings, felt like not in Singapore for a short time."
,,History and beauty - Battle Box tour,5.0,,"We went here last week and really enjoyed a guided tour of the Battle Box which is an underground bunker used by the Brits during the Second World War during the fall of Singapore.

If you love a little military history this is well worth a visit. fort Canning is still worth a visit as there is 700 yrs of History there."
,,Nice park.,4.0,,It provides interesting history of Singapore. I walked around here in the morning. Peaceful place near Clarke Quay. Good views of the city and nice place to chill. Nothing much to see other than lots of nice greenery and the city views.
,,Clean green space in downtown,4.0,,"A very beautiful quiet place in the heart of the city. Like any other park in Singapore,Fort Canning Park, is the place for strolling jogging and cycling around with fresh air. It used to be a fortress and bunker in World War II. It's convenient located in Southeast of Singapore. The highlights include underground crossing to the park is covered with shady of many trees."
,,Nice Cooling Spot with a hilltop view of Singapore,4.0,,"If you're tired of doing a walking tour of downtown Singapore, Fort Canning is the perfect place to rest a bit, one, it is FREE! The spice garden is educational, it is a wonderful introduction to the straits spices with a hint of history too. Moving up, at Raffles House, you can have a different perspective of Marina Bay and the rest of downtown Singapore. The ubiquitous park benches are very welcoming if you want to pause for a while and take in the air of Singapore! One downside though, I noticed, unlike in the Singapore Botanical Gardens, here at Fort Canning there are not many water fountains, so make sure to bring water before coming here. Fort Canning is just right next to the Singapore Philately Museum and the National Museum of Singapore."
,,Quite a Climb,4.0,,"The Park is effectively a hill, but a great place for a walk. The tour of the war tunnels is definitley worth doing, to understand the hitor of the fall of Singapore"
,,British history,4.0,,Leisurely way to breathe in history and imagine how it may have happened when the first Europeans arrived.
,,nice park close to the city,4.0,,Walked around here on a Sunday morning. Nice peaceful place just behind Clarke Quay. Good views of the city and nice place to chill. Nothing much to see other than lots of nice greenery and the city views.
,,Provides an interesting history of Singapore,4.0,,"Located essentially across the road from Clarke Quay climbing up Fort Canning (which is not too difficult) is worth the effort. Aside from the nice views to be had you will learn some of the history of Singapore, especially from a maritime perspective. The park is very green and lunch."
,,Oasis,5.0,,"Beautiful park in the middle of the city. Felt like a million miles away. Beautiful trails, trees, plants. Highly enjoyed."
,,The Battle Box tour is worthwhile,4.0,,"We have visited Singapore many times but this the first time we have a few hours at Fort Canning hill. Great views over the city, lots of historical locations and delightful shady walks. One highlight was the Battle Box tour which recounts the tale of the surrender to Japanese forces in WW2. Good guide and interesting set up in the bowels of the hill, as a bonus it is quite cool."
,,quiet place,5.0,,"Relaxing and a quiet park on a hill, you need good walking shoes for this place, cool and shady, very part of a very robust and hectic city"
,,a piece of history and a green retreat from the city,4.0,,"We walked through fort canning on our first morning in Singapore. We started near Clarke quay and enjoyed watching the bird life. We followed the markers and information signs to different aspects of the park. Very peaceful, at that time of the morning. Locals using the park for different activities, we walked by a yoga class, wedding preparations, joggers, young families playing and people walking dogs. We found the gates at the top, and the archaeological dig, yet didn't know a full history until we took the battle box tour. Great spot to connect with the city, the view is worth a few moments and a few photos."
,,Beautiful View of the City and River,1.0,,"Definitely a beautiful view from the top, worth the walk up all the stairs. Lovely at nght, although the information signs do not have any lighting so can't be rad."
,,Wlked her from Clarks Quay,4.0,,"Some steep climbing but lovely park with various terraces name d after famous people such as Raffles, who had a house there. Herb garden , various different plantings, large green sloping area, seating. Lovely museum and interesting small grave yard."
,,Calm in the centre of Singapore,4.0,,"An afternoon spent wandering the paths, sampling the aroma of the herb garden and and generally enjoying the plant and bird life. Ample information signs mean a self guided tour is possible and glean the story as you go. You can follow it up with a guided tour of the Battle Box."
,,Lovely getaway in the city centre,5.0,,"Love this park! It's small, you can walk the outside lap in less than an hour but there are a few inner trails including one that leads to Raffles House which is lovely. The entrance at the back of Funan mall has a tall staircase that is a good workout for the legs! If you are lucky you will see some wildlife."
,,Park in the center city,4.0,,"a lot of big trees, more than 100 years with natural around. It was a history place in World War II park. I had a good walk and enjoy to take pictures here."
,,Nice historic sight,4.0,,"The park is very well kept. Beautiful vegetation. Very clean.
We arrived and luckily were just in time for a guided tour of the bunker from WW2. The tour was very interesting, teaching a chapter in Singapore history. Do not miss the tour. Tour is not expensive and worth the money ."
,,Elevated oasis in the centre of Singapore,4.0,,"Came here ostensibly to visit the Battle Box but walked around while we waited for tours to commence.
There is certainly plenty to see and do from top to bottom. As another reviewer commented - there were butterflies everywhere.
A diverse selection of attractions - asian spice garden, archaeological dig, tomb etc etc
The gardens are certainly well maintained and the history boards are informative."
,,green and peaceful place in the city centre with an introduction to Singapore's history,5.0,,"nice place to get introduced to Singapore's history. green space in the very heart of the city, used to be a 'forbidden hill', home to Malay kings who ruled the island. nice retreat from the hot streets below the hill, a place for a slow walk or snack with a view. check out, the place holds regular exhibitions and/or concerts"
,,Saw lots of butterflies and was a beautiful walk,4.0,,"On a Saturday morning we walking Fort Canning Park for almost two hours to get a bit of exercise, read more history of Singapore, and take a scenic way to get from our hotel to Clark Quay for lunch. We are glad we did.

If one takes the time to read about the headstones on the wall, all of the signs in the park, and to view of all of the artifacts, one gets a better understanding of the history of this country. Sections of the park are divided into centuries with information about that time period. It's a fascinating walk through history.

Benches are stationed around Fort Canning if you need a break from walking or to relax in a bit of shade. We saw dozens of butterflies in this park and one bi-colored lizard."
,,Park,4.0,,This a small but a pretty old park here.A very good place to hangout with family and friends.A very good park for kids they love this.
,,Peaceful,4.0,,Walking around Fort Canning makes me wonder how this place can be so peaceful despite being in the heart of the city. There are some really huge old trees that tower over you and some amazing birds that chatter and chirrup all day long that makes this place really relaxing. You could sit back and relax while taking a view of the bustling city.
,,Great views of Sea and City,4.0,,I've been here dozens of times over the years. From the 80s when it was nothing but a hill with a few dirt trails to the nicely developed and yet low key vista that it is now. I often take a hike up here during my morning walks in Singapore. Lovely views of the city and the sea. Quiet and relaxing as well.
,,Rather grand and colonial,4.0,,This lovely green oasis is rather grand and colonial and is worth a visit to find out about colonial and WW2 historic events.
,,Lots things to see.,4.0,,This is a beautiful park once again beautifully maintained. Allow a fair bit of time to walk around as lots to look at and see.
,,A solace away from the hustle and bustle!,4.0,,"The Fort Canning Park offers visitors a solace away from the hustle and bustle of the city at the foot of the Fort Canning hill.

A leisure hike to the submit offers interesting sights and sounds such as the Hotel Fort Canning, a Spice Garden, the Registry of Marriages and not forgetting the lush undergrowth peppered with numerous species of plants and flowers.

Some interesting things to look out for includes but is not limited to:
‚Ä¢ The timeball
‚Ä¢ A glimpse of the reservoir atop the hill
‚Ä¢ A tomb believed to belong to one of the first kings of the then Singapura
‚Ä¢ The Battlebox - a tourist attraction which showcases an exquisitely architectures underground work quarter where the decision to surrender to the formidable opposing force was arrived at by Singapore's colonial guardians
‚Ä¢ A plain perfect for picnics
and many more!

The perfect place to get in touch with nature. But don't forget your insect repellents and water for hydration as you embark on the hike into nature! ;D"
,,Not worth a visit,3.0,,"We started our visit to Colonial District from this park following advice in Lonely Planet guide, but we're disappointed. From metro station we had to climb up the hill to enter the park and then to walk down. Not worth a visit."
,,Well worth the climb!,5.0,,"My wife and I climbed up to the park via the steps next to the main fire station on a very hot and sultry day in the city and it was literally a breath of fresh air to find oneself in the tranquility of the Fort Canning Park.Squirrels,birds of many sizes and colours,rats (nice ones),lizards and a mother pheasant and her chick got on with their daily routines as we sat quietly watching.I did some sketches of the lighthouse!!Some good views out over the city through the gaps in the trees.There are some huge and beautiful trees in this park.Well worth the effort."
,,Oasis in the middle of the city,4.0,,"Nice and relaxful place in the heart of the city. From Clarke Quay you can go up and be in the green. Old trees...big , with hudge crowns offering a lot of shade at noon. Couple of old houses including the Raffels one. Couple of canons, old fort walls, Museum (Pinacotheque de Paris)"
,,Nice park,4.0,,This is a beautiful park. It is not very big. I walked through it to go to the National Museum. A nice change from the shopping malls.
,,Beware that this park is full of mosquito,5.0,,"Nice and peaceful park in the city, it's a treasure in the city that you can find many thing to see, the battlebox, the art gallery, the fort canning green, Gothic gate,cannon, ligt house ( YES, there is a light house there!! ) and a Sultan/King Iskandar Syah's grave."
,,Lots of stairs but still a nice location,5.0,,We walked through this park and it was nice to visit. Had to walk up lots of stairs to get to the top.
,,Garden full of suprises,5.0,,Fort Canning Park is well worth a visit. It has a small archaeological site and its own spice gardens.
,,Good escape into nature in the middle of CBD,4.0,,Good natural work out option in the hustle and bustle of the city.. It is hilly and has quite a few steps but is a beautiful place which nature lovers will enjoy.. Hosts plays and shows from time to time so might be worth checking out if they are hosting anything when you plan to visit
,,Hillier than expected,3.0,,"We entered the Park from the Dhoby Ghaut MRT end. There is a shortcut via Park Mall (lift to level 4 and out through the car park) that cuts out the steep stairs. We diverted to the Singapore National Museum (for a visit to the Singapore History Gallery) and then planned to return to the Park using the escalator only to find the up one was not working - so stairs to climb. The Park was hillier than we realised and found it difficult to get to the heart of it. We always seemed to be on the outskirts. Poor signage? Nevertheless, what we saw we liked. We exited at the other end onto Hill Street. The stairs down were long and steep so unless you are energetic the Dhoby Ghaut end provides easier access."
,,Beautiful Gardens very well maintained,5.0,,"Spent the best part of a day walking the park - very well laid out, good views of the city and very interesting to read the history of the fort and see the fort gate (dates from the late C19th). Only disappointment was that there were many school tours and we didn't manage to see the Battle Box (an underground bunker system used in WW2) as the guide advised us it would be too crowded and noisy (school trip). We didn't have the time to come back later or on another day. Nevermind this will be on our itinerary for our next trip to Singapore all being well."
,,Lovely peaceful retreat from the city,5.0,,Hard to believe this is a stone throw from bustling orchard road. Great to walk around. The archeological excavations are particularly interesting and if you are here during Shakespeare in the park it's worth getting a ticket
,,Definitely worth a visit,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is well set out and combines the history of old Singapore,with the recent war years. It is possibly not suitable for people who have difficulty walking too far or cannot climb steps however. When I last visited ,the bunkers were open to the public and we did a tour. This is where the disastrous defence of Singapore was run from, by General PercivalO(not his fault!) and his officers,plus some 300 personnel. There are also various trails one can follow with a plentiful number of sign boards,setting out various key historical events in the early days of Singapore. It is also well worhwhile poring over the grave headstones in the gardens,which are set into the wall. They give one a fascinating incite into the old colonials who lived here,their range of nationalities,their longevity(which in many cases was short) and an incite into how they died.."
,,I like this place,4.0,,"This is a place where you can almost get away. It is small but well laid out. Great for running, exercising, romantic walks etc. For fitness buffs there is even a fitness station, but be warned it is hot work in this area as is sheltered from the much needed breeze."
,,"Visit for the history, stay for the views",3.0,,"If you're feeling mildly athletic, this historic landmark is definitely worth a meandering visit, and is a great escape from the nearby bustling Clarke Quay and Orchard Road. The landscaping is beautiful, there's a museum (check opening times in advance) and some fantastic ruins with informational signs - the views are great too.

A handy hint: avoid visiting in the middle of the day (or wear a hat), and take a bottle of water - it gets very hot and humid!"
,,Good Place,5.0,,"This is a good place next to Clarke Quay. It is a nice destination for a short trek. The place has a huge lawn and is good for jogging and running. The terrain here is full of high's and low's. At some places, you get very tired while hiking.
Good for workout during mornings and evenings."
,,Slog uphill to Battle Box,4.0,,"In the heat of the day you slog up the hill only to find that there is a 40 minute wait for the next tour guide. If like us you have your 7 year old grandson with you then 40 minutes waiting time is not an option. So the moral of the story is to always check out tour times before you go. Nice helpful staff in the visitor's center where you can buy a gift, sweets, drinks or ice cream while you wait, when you have finished they will even call a cab for you."
,,Glad we checked it out,4.0,,"Went for a morning stroll at 5:30am. A couple of stairs to climb here and there but pretty much anyone can do it, if they pace themselves. The park itself wraps around a huge mountain that surrounds Fort Canning. Even before sunrise there were people exercising, so we felt safe. Worth a look if your staying around this area."
,,Well worth the climb up the steps,4.0,,Not having read about Fort Canning park we came across it by accident. But a climb up the steps with stops to admire the view on the way was worthwhile. It was much cooler amongst the trees than at ground level.
,,Looks Like a small park on the Hill but its HUGE,4.0,,"The Fort Canning Park was directly across the road from our Hotel and we had 2 hours to kill before we went to the airport so decided to go and have a look.So glad we did.It was really beautiful and tranquil.Filled with sculptures,Exotic gardens and lots of history.Lots of joggers running through there.Beautiful spot and worth the visit.The stairs are easy to climb and there are not that many of them."
,,The Battle Box - An insightful journey,4.0,,"Had the privilege of a first hand guided tour of the Battle Box at Fort Canning Park before its official opening, and an honour having its director Mr. Jeya Ayadurai as our guide.
The underground bunker had been restored with major structures at its original state, down to the crystallised minerals formed on the walls. With the addition of modern day a/c and de-humidifiers, the conditions was great for a historical journey through the turbulent 1940s. The guide gave an unforgettable account of what happened during the last days before Singapore fell to the Japanese during WWII and you cannot help but to be astounded by the way he presented and unfolds the events that lead to 12 men deciding the fate of this sunny island.
Singaporeans especially the younger generation must have a go at this place and appreciate what our forefathers had gone through to build up what we have today."
,,"Out of the way, a surprising historical park",5.0,,A bit of old Singapore high on the hill above the city. Interesting buildings and relics within a large park. Look especially for the gravestones of English colonials who often did not last more than a few months before succumbing to tropical diseases.
,,A quite oasis with a dash of history,4.0,,"A lovely green oasis to escape the hub Bub of Singapore, leafy paths and spice gardens to wander around, or shady trees to sit under in the heat of the day.
In the middle is the battle box, the underground bunker that the defence of Singapore was commanded from. Now restored there are guided tours through the bunker that allow you to relive the desperate days of 1942 (around $30 with tours running about 4 times a day)"
,,Interesting local history,4.0,,Enjoyed a pleasant stroll round here. There are quite a lot of steps! There is a spice garden and plenty of shady areas to sit and relax. Some magnificent trees too. We didn't look round the battery this time as had seen it before but worth looking at.
,,A beautiful peace of nature in the city center.,5.0,,"Have been enjoying Fort Canning Park for some lunchtime breaks. The park is very green and offers a lot of shade in most areas.

Perfect if you want to exercise as it has lots and lots of stairs.

But also just as perfect if you want to just relax for a moment. It's usually quiet with not too many other visitors.

The signs around the walkways talk you through the history of the Fort/Singapore."
,,Great spot of history,4.0,,"Super place to visit at the top of the hill in Singapore. Hot day and hard walk but great views and a quiet area. Such a large area that people can be absorbed.
Only came across on toilet and a small cafe near the main entrance but that was part of its charm. There is a hotel in the grounds.
Grounds are well used by local groups and the centre is fenced off with high security fencing etc.
Great picnic area or place to visit and read the information boards placed around the site.
Notable for old guns/ Sally port and fortifications."
,,Nice Climb up Fort Canning,3.0,,"Fort Canning is located at prime shopping area of Singapore. I've been there a few times, and some marathon take this route as this is very challenging to climb up and down Fort Canning Park.

At night, this place is very beautiful and romantic for couple as it is a nice park to chill at and do prepare mosquito repellent if you are there at night."
,,The battle box,5.0,,Do visit this lovely park. With herb gardens and unusual flowers & trees. Then visit the underground Battle box. The place where the English were dug in when they had to surrender to the Japanese. All kept the same with working models to show the horrendous situation they had when there water was disconnected.
,,A hidden tourist gem,4.0,,A very well kept park for both history and exercise. Lots of history with regard to the old fort and its gate structure. The under ground battle box and cannons and lots of old Singapore history. Informative plaques everywhere. Great running tracks and lots of stairs for cardio.
,,A Beautiful Park in the Middle of a City,5.0,,"Each year when we holiday in Singapore we always make a point of walking through the park several times during our stay. Gives good lookout points for parts of Singapore, lovely birds and wildlife can be spotted. It's a beautiful park and has made different walkways that lead out onto different parts of the city."
,,"Hard climbs, and you get bitten to death",3.0,,"We decided to walk around Fort Canning, mainly because of the military historic perspective. Well when we got there this element was closed for refurbishment. Undeterred we carried on. Big mistake, it is one heck of a climb, normally not a problem, but in 90% humidity and about 90f it is a challenge. I got bitten to death, so much so that a few days later I had to seek medical advice and treatment. There are public toilets but not much else. All in all go to the Botanic Gardens they are much easier to navigate and have better facilities."
,,I love this place,4.0,,"This park is very nice for quiet walk and picnics. I love the scenery and the country feel. Very nice for a good walk, i sometimes come in this place when i wanted to just be alone and read and relax."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,not as good as Gardens by the bay - but still awesome - take good walking shoes and the main building has a Spanish style restaurant and art exhibitions.
,,Pleasant,4.0,,"Stumbled across this park on a walkabout and enjoyed an hour or so strolling around. On a planned visit I would use mosquito repellent as I was bitten quite badly. Interesting plants,trees and spice garden."
,,Tranquility,5.0,,This rather large park is hilly with plenty of walkways and greenery It has history and is an oasis in this bustling city
,,Look out for performances and concerts,4.0,,"Located at the heart of the town area, a short walk from Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, this is a good place to visit for a walk or a run. There are performaces held here too, you can get your tickets from sistic."
,,Get your exercise,4.0,,Well positioned park. Central to city. Lots of self explanatory signs to help you understand the history. Great walking.
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Due to the wet weather, not so conducive but the place was wonderful. Rich in history. Nice view, overall great experience"
,,Great place to wander,4.0,,"On a Sunday parking was free. Pathways were really good it was lightly raining but they weren't slippery. Lots of shade. There were steps on done paths but always a ramp option close by. A great snapshot of the history of the hill, archaeological dig, time ball, lighthouse and cemetery. Would recommend."
,,"Beautiful, Peaceful walking area",5.0,,"The park is at the top of a hill, and has at least 160 steps to the top from the Hill Street side. Once you navigate that, you have a pleasant walk around a large covered reservoir at the top, with several historical artifacts and sites. There may be less strenuous way up there, perhaps from the Fort Canning Hotel, but I enjoyed the exercise of the climb. There are great views of the river and other areas of Singapore and many signs describing the sights. There are also many trees and plants that are labeled for the botany inclined tourist."
,,Beautiful and historical,5.0,,I really loved wondering around the park. There are a variety of different tracks you can follow which have signs along the way with interesting historical facts as well as old buildings and features such as canons and a lighthouse.
,,A beautiful well kept park,5.0,,"We spent a morning wandering through this park as there is so much to see, and there is lots of wild birds to photograph. There is a well stocked Spice garden with some plants we have never seen before."
,,Raffles house,4.0,,"Am a volunteer at the fort canning park and love it as such. The other day we had a seminar in the Raffles house. So nice and old. Re: the approach to the Fort canning park, if you are not comfortable with steps, then the most convenient approach is from the Registry of marriages, rest of the approaches are almost each about a climb of 200 steps to get into the main park"
,,Place to Enjoyed the walk on Saturday,5.0,,"We took mrt to Dhobyghaut and exit A. After crossing the road just saw the sign for Park. Very easy to find.

We saw a few tiny chickens and squirrels around the park. A lot of big trees here. In the park have small place to sit in for picnic or resting and also a few bench along the walk way.

There was NoNe public toilet or water tap around the park. Better to do your business and grab some bottle of drinking water from 7-11 inside MRT."
,,"Take The Time, It's Worth It",5.0,,"Right in the middle of the city is one of Singapore's hidden gems. This park is not only beautifully maintained and accessible to everyone, it also has some of the islands most interesting history points and world heritage sites. You will be surprised!"
,,Where are the toilets?,4.0,,"Followed the public toilet signs but they were locked to concert goers. Female staff at the museum wouldn't let concert goers use their toilets either (very unpleasant woman) so anyone lining up had to walk 10 minutes away to Park Mall for the loo. I thought Singapore is a developed country but event organizers or venues don't even supply this basic necessity. Only toilets supplied by the organizers were in the arena and not open to public till we entered 4 hours later (depends how long you've been lining up)!

Fort Canning Park is otherwise a really nice location for gigs, cool and refreshing and it's a pity my experience was marred by this."
,,Big forest-like park,3.0,,"This park is very big, energy consuming for sure if you explore the whole park.
It is quite nice, park in the middle of the town.
It is like a city forest, sometimes people use this place for photography spot or prewed photo shoot. Inside the park there is marriage registry office."
,,A lovely walk in the park,4.0,,"Centrally located near to Clark's Quay this is a lovely place to spend a couple of hours strolling around, and its free. Various things of interest to see as you wander around."
,,Tranquil amidst chaos,3.0,,"Romantic place to visit, brings back memories from childhood. Tranquil place amidst the bustling city. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Tranquil and beautiful,4.0,,"We walked the entirety of the park and particularly loved the trees with hanging branches , very different to back in the UK . It is well cared for and is a little oasis in the middle of the city. For those who are not able bodied be aware that some of the routes have lots of steps but there is always some sort of alternative."
,,Nice walk,3.0,,Quiet oasis in the midst of a busy metropolis. Relatively cool due to the abundance of trees. The National Museum of Singapore is close by.
,,Various opprtunities,4.0,,"Beautiful park, when in season you can enjoy opera and ballet - keep updated with what is going ob or just enjoy this historic park"
,,Well worth a morning here,5.0,,"I went in my own as my boyfriend was off at tyhge grandprix track.I wasljed to the park asns astound. It has great wheelchair access. The park was a delight to walk around. There is parking and a visitor centre.
The different gardens were wonderful to walk through. And seeing the history of the place was so insightful. The weather did change whilst I was there and the break was in temperature was much needed. The sculpture and spice gardern was my favourite.
The bunker was under refurbishment while I was there but opened again in autumn. When I go next year I will definitely be re visiting"
,,Beautiful Park,5.0,,"We walked through Fort Canning Park on a rainy afternoon, which may explain why there was no-one else there! Neat pathways, well-maintained gardens and beautifully set out. This is a real haven right in the middle of Singapore."
,,"Nice, large City Park across from Clarke Quay",4.0,,"Sitting on the grounds of the former Fort Canning, and prior ancient temples, this a great spot to go for a stroll or run. It's accessible via metro, bus and/or walking. It's a fairly large park and you can enter from many different areas, and it gets popular on weekends. There's history to be seen here with the old fort walls/bastions/cannons, and some houses/structures. There's also an art museum near the top of the hill you can tour. A few cafes are located on the grounds (one inside the art museum, and some along the outskirts). There's also a hotel on the grounds. Lots of green here, very pleasant for walking. Strollers and wheelchairs can also be used. It's great for a jog and there are some pull-up bars, balance beams, etc. along the path for further exercise. The national museum can be accessed after coming out of the Northeast side of the park.

For a tour, word is it's a stop on the World War II tour out of the Changi Museum."
,,A pleasant place to sit and think,5.0,,"This is a very nice quiet park , to just walk, jog, sit, or make pictures while staying in the city. It is one of the best places to visit in Singapore if you like to be in a quiet outdoor park. It is safe, clean, and peaceful; and all free of charge entrance.
One of it's entrance is just across Funan digital mall so you can go and sit with a nice book if you are not keen in coming along into the 'man's mall' when in Singapore :-)."
,,Walking back in time with Sultans and Great Explorers,4.0,,"I have been here many times for events and dropping guests on their many excursions but never spent much time on my own. An afternoon wander along the footpaths and fort walls reading commemorative plates and the names on headstones of earlier settlers gave me a good understanding how Singapore's entrep√¥t reputation was sealed over a century ago.
I found Armenian, Arabian, British, Dutch, German, Russian, Portugese and variety of other names on these headstones and the few forgotten graves on the far end of Fort Canning Green towards the bottom of the hill.
Many artifacts in museums here from the Asian Civilizations to the Peranakan, Malay and Indian Cultural museums were dug up right here from these grounds!
Not forgetting the grand mosoluems of regents and the Malayan royal court, found in the farther end of the field.
It really must have been a magical time of great explorers coming from far flung lands and of traders and adventure seekers making their mark in Singapore. Must come back when the Battle Box is open again."
,,A plesant city park,4.0,,We cut through here from Orchard Road to Clarkes Quay and found it to be a really pleasant a quite park in the middle of the city. Nice place to spend a bit of time
,,Interesting quiet park,5.0,,"We were staying in the Novotel so just walked over the road to explore this park and really enjoyed it there was a lot going on on a Sunday morning. Graduates were floating about in gowns having there photos taken, there was a model doing a photo shoot in rediculously high heels and a gold minidress and men were fencing with long poles with knives on the end. In addition there were signs telling you what the trees were and an interesting history trail with information on the history of Singapore. There is also a big art gallery although we did not visit that. Well worth a visit , often overlooked, an oasis of trees right in the middle of Singapore."
,,Heritage - a sensory experience.,5.0,,"The hill once known as Forbidden Hill for its defence structures and colonial Government House today is home to a hotel, and the Singapore branch of the Pinacotheque art museum.

Visitors are welcome to explore on their own the centuries-old Malay heritage trail, with the supposed tomb ""Keramat"" of the last Sultan of the Melakan Empire.

Two British-era cannon still exist.

Guided tours by the National Parks Board are available on weekend mornings and late afternoons, subject to group numbers and the weather.

Nature lovrrs will appreciate the scents emanating from its Spice Garden.

It is also a favourite spot for wedding photo shoots, in particular at the ""Gothic"" and Fort gates.

There are entry points by foot next to the National Museum, and along Hill Street. Parking is also available, so is public transport."
,,Cool and inviting,4.0,,If you need a rest from the bustle of Singapore this is the place to visit. A walk round the greenery and trees is very restful. Take a picnic and spend time exploring the statues and monuments. Of course you can always use the paths for running and jogging if that is your preference. A busy place on Sunday with crowds of migrant workers having their day off and congregating there. The length of stay would depend on what you wanted to do there. Could be half an hour to 3 or more hours.
,,New attractions for the Francophiles,3.0,,Fort Canning is a bit difficult to go to without a car but the visit can be rewarding if you're into arts and all-things French. The Pinacotheque that recently opened is the main attraction of this area. It's worth visiting if you're interested in the ongoing exhibit.
,,Great for walking / running - close to Clarke Quay,4.0,,Great option for walking around or going for a run when in town. Close to the River and just above Clarke Quay.
,,An oasis of calm,4.0,,We enjoyed a pleasant morning exploring the charms of Canning Park. Although close to City Hall the park is a quiet and relaxing place. As you walk around the park there are numerous markers explaining the various historical sites within the park.
,,AMAZING,5.0,,I was in vacations with my family in the hotel near this park. We just walked and hung out ! It was a magic moment and I advice you to go there !
,,Most amazing gem in the middle of a bustling city,5.0,,"I am staying at Novotel Clarke Quay, right opposite to Fort Canning Park, a most amazing gem in the middle of a bustling city. I was up before sunrise and couldn't sleep afterwards, hence decided to check the place out. The park has access from Clarke quay through a pedestrian bridge. I had never anticipated what I was about to see. Steep hill upwards, followed by great treks. You have lots of signs telling you about the history of Singapore and believe me, at every sign you end up stopping and reading it.

Such a quiet and serene place in the middle of this city, I had never imagined. The park is free (place where I come from, we pay entry fees to public parks). It's a very peaceful place and for sure a suitable location for a jog, walk or a picnic.

Must visit"
,,"Fort Canning includes ""The Battle Box"" a marvellous mini-museum for historians",5.0,,"Especially for military historians. The park itself is a delightful morning walk featuring typical Singaporean tropical foliage. However it is much more than that as it includes remnants of the British military base with some wonderful old buildings. Particularly impressive is the ""Battle Box"" which was an underground bunker used by the British high command during the Japanese invasion in World War II. There is a realistic reenactment of the fateful decision to surrender all Allied forces to the Japanese by General Percival during a general staff meeting. Very insightful."
,,Great dining and lounging,5.0,,This area of Singapore is off the beaten path and contains several restaurants and pubs. This used to me a military compound that was turned into restaurants and pubs and has great dining and drinking. Best to see in the evening when the activity picks up.
,,Hills and stairs,3.0,,"Climbed up all the hills and stairs. Saw a lighthouse and a few canons. A bit of a view but not much. Don't go here during the heat of the day, you will be disappointed."
,,The old historic Fort Canning Park,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is the oldest park in Singapore. You can find lots of cannon ball trees and nutmeg trees here. There is an old cemetery near the front gates and the cemetery is being preserved whilst other cemeteries like Bidadari has been demolished for housing development.
Fort Canning Park is frequented by courting couples in their 20s and at night many couples come here to renew their vows.
At times foreign bands give a public performance on a makeshift stage put up for the purpose.
There is an old kramat where a Muslim saint was once buried. You can see some old cannons used by the British when they were in Singapore during the colonial days."
,,Beautiful and Peaceful,4.0,,It is a challenging walk in parts but there is some real beauty here. The park has some really ancient trees and the views of Clarke Quay and Singapore River and worth the walking effort
,,Beautiful and Peaceful,4.0,,"The park is a nice change from the hustle and bustle of Singapore city, and you would never guess it was right in the centre of it all. It's nice to walk through and lounge under the trees for a bit of shade from the humidity. I would definitely recommend strolling through if you have the time."
,,Historic,5.0,,"Anyone with an interest in the military side of Singapore's history has to visit Fort Canning Park. The actual room where it was decided that Singapore would be surrendered in February 1942 is spine - chilling. I think you are only allowed in with an official tour, but I believe that's the best wayt o go anyway."
,,"Peacefull, Tranquility...",4.0,,"Stumbled across this place by accident. Great place to visit, walking around the gardens and taking in some of the history."
,,Singaporean History In The Park,4.0,,"A very good park in the city, lots of historic plaques abound telling the story of the settlement of Singapore, many hundreds of years ago, well before the arrival of Raffles. Also the old cemetery and buildings from the colonial days all tell stories, a interesting place to visit to get the history of the peninsula. Definitely worth a visit."
,,A quiet escape from the city,4.0,,"We walked from Orchard Road to Clarke Quay though this park, it was a good escape from the city. There is a lot of history here so it is worth exploring to learn more about the city."
,,Madness in a good way,3.0,,"Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun , and while I am neither English or a dog , I was crazy enough to walk up all of those steps in the hottest part of the day ...........and you know what .......it was worth it , while it was a bit of a lungbuster for this overweight arthritic traveller the views are good , the shady trees and gentle breezes provide provide genuine relief . There were lots of locals having picnics , people ( crazy) exercising , strange birds in the trees and lizards in the grass and it's quiet . Once my wife and I got our second wind it was great , so just do it."
,,"Interesting, but will be better when the 'Battle Box' reopens",4.0,,It's amazing how peaceful this historic city-centre park is. Very helpful lady in the visitor centre.
,,Nice and Peaceful Walk - Not all park attractions were open,3.0,,"Nice park for a stroll with spice park, gardens, memorials, lookout etc. The Fitness corner is closed until 30 November 2015. And unfortunately the Battle Box is closed until February 2016. It does seem that some of the Singapore tourist sites don't advertise that well they are actually closed."
,,Historical hill - 2km circumference,4.0,,This hill is accessible from Dhoby Ghaut or Clarke Quay MRT stations - a short walk away. The circumference from the hill top is only 2km and it makes for a great place to run in the morning and evening.
,,Lovely Historical Walks,5.0,,This is a lovely place away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore. There are several routes to walk around the park and we chose to do the history trail. It was a fascinating trail with regular information boards and lots to look at. Its a beautiful old fort and we had a lovely walk - if you want to get away from it all for an hour or so then take a look.
,,Walk and see the sights,5.0,,"This is a great place to visit in the early mornign when there is no one around. A great place to get exercise, particularly going up and down the stairs."
,,A nice place to walk in the morning,4.0,,When I stay along the river I walk every morning. This is one of the places I try to get to because it's a bit more quite and peaceful. There is some interesting history to learn about here as well and a few well placed placards to help you. Enjoy the views from here as I do.
,,Beautiful old park,5.0,,"We didn't actually walk through this park but we stayed in a boutique old hotel with in the park. The park has lots of beautiful old lush green trees, lots of walking paths, good views & fairly quiet for the middle of the city."
,,A great park to stroll in,5.0,,Fort Canning Park has a number of thematic areas that are well laid out with easy walking trails. There is a Heritage Museum with interesting displays as well as a refurbished World War II bunker with a display of General Percival and his staff as they make the fateful decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese in 1942.
,,Interesting place and good views,4.0,,Well worth the uphill walk.Huge trees and lush foliage.Great views all around and quieter than some other places
,,Lovely walks; pity the trees block the views!,5.0,,"Walked up on a rainy morning which didn't spoil the experience. The history is very interesting and well signposted, and the gardens are lovely. The spice garden is great for anyone interested in either food or gardening."
,,Where heritage and nature go hand in hand,4.0,,"I love the history behind this place. There is a small heritage walk around the park that can be covered in an afternoon. So glad the memorials in the walls of the old Christian cemetery as well as some of the tombstones are preserved. You don't see these much anymore. Plus an archaeological excavation site right within the park itself! If you're into history do visit the Battle Box too (but this is closed till Jan 2016). This special place is heritage juxtaposed with nature. There's a huge field right in front of the new pinacotheque where you can do a picnic. Many picture-worthy scenery here. There's also a huge spice garden where you get to smell the mint, artemisia species, Indian borage, pandan leaves and many others.

There are two entrances to the park, both accessible via public transport. dhoby ghaut station and Clarke Quay station (the latter brings you to what I'd call the back entrance). The dhoby ghaut entrance is within walking distance to other attractions such as the malls, the national museum and philatelic museum, while the Clarke Quay station entrance is in close proximity to the Singapore River and Chinatown, just to name a few."
,,pleasant park,3.0,,"Although the park is beautifully maintained, there is not a lot to do here. There is a lot of walking, up step stairs or paths. I enjoyed the peacefulness of the area however with 1 gate, 2 cannons and a light house to look at, I was expecting more.

I would definitely recommend you go and look but don't budget for anything more than 1 hour. I was expecting a visitors centre with a map to show myself around but nothing."
,,Historical Park,4.0,,This park was part of our prenup shoot. I remember the clean grass and nice view shots! good for pictorials!
,,Place for a weekend picnic,5.0,,You can visit this place for a weekend picnic with your friends and family.. Certainly not a must visit place for the tourists but you can definitely go there for a stroll whilst you visit Clarke Quay... It's just a 5 mins walk from Clarke Quay.. You can see the first lighthouse of Singapore at this place which is definitely an attraction in itself...
,,A day in a forest in the middle of the city !,4.0,,"Well such place need a map , it's very nice holding a lot of greenly landscape but be aware of entrance and exits it could be exhausting going up and down without a map as the park is big enough to get lost inside , most of attractions like the battle box was closed for renovation so you could go just to enjoy the park , watch the art center and take some pictures !"
,,Beautiful park,4.0,,A beautiful park to visit and get away from the busy city streets. Lots to see so its well worth a visit!
,,great sunday outing,4.0,,"nice to have walk across the park, theres some nice hill top picture/selfie talking opportunities..."
,,Fabulous History,5.0,,Early morning walk and explore the history that surrounds this place and take in the views and fresh air.
,,A little slice of history,4.0,,"A site of huge historical significance, including the British surrender to the Japanese, with a lot of interesting detail and an air-conditioned exhibition area. Part of the park was cordoned off for a private event which meant we couldn't get to some of the old architecture. Information on the park shuttle seemed patchy and easy to miss - we were not able to catch it."
,,Lovely day out,4.0,,"A beautiful park, situated in the middle of the city. Very well maintained and some very interesting insights into Singapore's history on the various boards around. A variety of different things to see and do here. I was particularly interested in the WWII exhibits, go and see the Battle Box if you can. Afterwards cooled down with a beer in the Fort Canning Hotel which was very pleasant."
,,Very popular with locals for lunch,4.0,,"More by chance we 'crossed' this park, not knowing that it is a rather steep hill, finding groups of 'office workers' sitting left and right, on tarps, under trees, enjoying their lunch. There's lots of signage to be fascinated about, interesting bits of history and some nice views of the city. Worth checking out!"
,,Still One of My Favourite Park,5.0,,"It is by far my most favorite park in Singapore. It is located in the centre, not too crowded and conveniently located. Although the paid attractions are not really worth the price (as most Singapore attractions are), but I still enjoy visiting this park."
,,Great park and history,5.0,,"Only a 5 minute walk from City Hall MRT Station, Fort Canning Park is almost a hidden gem in Singapore - there were only about a dozen people there when I visited this afternoon. Although few of the original structures remain, there are dozens of excellent information boards dotted throughout the park detailing its history. There are a number of different, well marked and easy trails to follow too. Although small, I did enjoy walking through and on top of 'the gate' of Fort Canning, as well as seeing the cannons nearby. It's free and well worth spending an hour or two of your day here."
,,Fort Canning Park,4.0,,"Quite a lot of steps up to it, but I believe there may be an escalator somewhere which I could not find. Nice shady respite from the sun, but the views no longer exist."
,,A great urban park :),4.0,,"Quite easily accessible while in Singapore since it's like right in the middle of the city, this park is a great place to unwind your day after a hustle and bustle of shopping malls or that of just the general street life of Singapore (you know what that's like just after a few days you've been there!). Better yet, spend about two or three hours and go for a leisurely nature walk like I did from the north end of the park just behind Singapore National Museum to the south end (I pretty much stuck just to the east side of the park), checking out along the way: the ASEAN Sculpture Garden (just a few sculptures there though as far as I saw); the WW2 relic structures like the 'Battle Box' where British General Percival issued the order to surrender Singapore to the Japanese during the war, the hideout structure called Sally Port from which to surprise enemies, the little one-story building called OMSQ which stands for Old Married Soldiers' Quarters, the gate structure with something like a big munition storage box beside it; the Spice Garden (not that impressive or I maybe I didn't know what to expect in a ""spice garden""); the tomb of an ancient Malay ruler of the island; and finally the Maritime Corner with a lighthouse (the only such onshore navigational facility on the island back in the day), a historic flag mast (from colonial times but cut down by the Japanese during their occupation of the island and restored after the war), a little house where some treaty was signed or something. I've pretty much listed these places in order going from north to south although you may have to make a little circle around the area in the north to see the WW2 stuff mentioned above, the Spice Garden after those war relics is on the way from north to south, and the Maritime Corner is pretty much at the southeast corner of the park after which you could come down the set of stairs from the Raffles Terrace to Hill St. (same as Victoria St. as it's called a few blocks to the north) below and exit the park.

By public transportation, one way to get to the north end of the park (and make your way down south from there like I did) is taking the MRT to Bras Basah station (yellow line); once you're out on Bras Basah Rd., turn right and walk until you hit Bencoolen, then turn left and walk until you get to the end of Bencoolen and see the National Museum, then go over to the left side of the museum where you'll see the escalator going up to the park (the north end of the park); it will be just about ten minutes' walk from when you come up onto Bras Basah Rd. from the MRT until getting to the park.

Or if you'd rather go directly to the Maritime Corner where the Lighthouse is at the southeast corner of the park, one way to do that is to take the MRT to City Hall station (green & red lines, and yes a different station from Bras Basah mentioned above!); once you're on North Bridge Rd. after coming out of the station, walk south about one block (or half a block), then turn right onto Coleman, walk another block then left onto Hill, and then just past the Central Fire Station on the right side of the road you'll see the steps of the Raffles Terrace leading up to the park."
,,Interesting,3.0,,Came across this place by accident taking a shortcut from Robertson Quay into the city. It's really very interesting - as you walk up and down (and beware it is steep in parts) there are plaques that tell you the history of Singapore. My daughter has been to several open air concerts there
,,Lovely walk but hilly,5.0,,"Had a great walk through Fort Canning Park. However, we did not realise there were so many hills. In the heat of that day, we had to make several stops and were glad we had taken sufficient quantities of water. The herb garden was fascinating as were the statutes. The steep descent on the other side of the park led us to the creek and, further on, Chinatown or the High Street. Nice stroll for us."
,,An oasis of interest!,5.0,,"What a lovely retreat from the bustling streets of Singapore, even though you are in the heartbif the city. The flora and fauna are a sight to behold and the history of the Fort is so interesting. I haven't visited the Battle Box yet but will do on my next visit."
,,Great place also at night,5.0,,I had several hours to kill in a flight transit and was roaming around the city. Ended up alone in this park around midnight. It was so quiet and the smells coming from plants were very peculiar. If you have sensitive sense of smell i would recommend it at night. Very safe for a solo female traveller too.
,,wonderfull park .........,5.0,,"wonderful park ......... and on weekdays not many people. typical singapore, clean, well maintained, safe, very recomandable."
,,Lovely park with history,5.0,,Great park for an amble. This park has some remarkable trees and nice landscaping. It also has some interesting historical information to read on various plaques as you tour the park.
,,Peace in the middle of the city,5.0,,"This is a peaceful walk in nature in the midst of a bustling city. Being centrally located, it is easy to access and the paved trails make it easy for all levels of mobility."
,,Small and dull,3.0,,"Not alot of it is open, still closed for construction or they haven't started working on it yet. They seem to focus more on the laser quest and paint ball section than the actual history of the place."
,,A welcome relief from the streets of Singapore,3.0,,"If you are in Singapore for any length of time you will no doubt feel like just getting away from the hustle of life on the streets. Fort Canning Park is easy an to reach peaceful retreat that will let you recharge. Of historical significance, it is a good way to spend an hour or two before hitting the streets again"
,,history day,3.0,,"This is a welcome change to the concrete of modern Singapore. This is all about the history of Singapore and is situated on the 'forbidden hill'. The area is full of history and greenery.Plenty to do, suitable for families. Places to eat. There is a spice garden and walks to follow. Good day out. I would suggest an umbrella to keep the sun off a little."
,,Stunning views and a quiet paradise in the middle of the city,4.0,,"This was a lovely break accessible by public transport and a short walk from Clarke Quay. Walking around the well manicured gardens was very enjoyable. There are plenty of benches to rest and water fountains, drink vending machines and a couple of public toilets along the way. Both the city and the river can be viewed, and there are stunning trees and flowers for your viewing pleasure. We spent a couple of hours walking around but you can also see it in less time."
,,Better than a treadmill,3.0,,"If your hotel is nearby run the park in the early morning instead of a treadmill, ideally placed close the Clark Quay and is pleasant before the sun gets up and starts cooking everything."
,,Nice park,4.0,,"once you are up the hill and in the shade of the trees then it is a bit cooler, but still be prepared for a hot walk. Nice paths through spice garden and park. easy to get to via Dhoby Ghaut or Clarkes Quay MRT."
,,Fort canning,4.0,,This is a small fort up a hill . Singapore has preserved it as their heritage .They have a a gallery where they have different exhibitions . During the 50 yrs of golden jubilee celebration they had a theme of cleopatra . It was very nice . They have a small museum with their history intact . A nice change .
,,Great park,5.0,,Beautiful park to wander through to escape the traffic fumes and heat. Interpretive signs give an insight into the history of Singapore. Park is popular with joggers and walkers.
,,"Relaxing walk in the middle of the city. If you get too hot, just go into one of the museums to cool down",4.0,,"This park is on a hill, so wear cool clothing to prevent overheating. I was here on a business trip and I enjoyed doing a nice ""nature walk"" in this park instead of walking around the city. It is a very relaxing refuge from the city."
,,Small park near Clarke Quay,3.0,,Not much to see. The Battery Box is currently closed. The archeological diggings were very interesting.
,,Spent the day,5.0,,Walking around seen a great place with lots a historic item and gardens place to sit view from the gardens over the city It is a big walk but worth it a good down time no having to rush around and seeing the sites
,,Lovely and scenic park.,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park offers a wonderful opportunity to take a leisurely stroll through one of Singapore's older locations with historic relevance. The park can be accessed from a number of locations or the MRT station near Clarke Quay. There are a number of walking paths through the park and an opportunity of seeing some of the local wildlife - squirrels if you are lucky. The park is used as a fitness training area early mornings and there are a few places of interest throughout with some rest areas.
Well worth the effort up and down the small hill area - recommend earlier in the morning before it gets too hot."
,,Interesting tourist spot,4.0,,"A small hill in Singapore whereby it house the ""Black Box"" depicting the surrender of the Japanese during the Japanese occupation. You need to pay a small fee to see the exhibits.

Come prepared with water bottles as it is scorching hot in this open space and you are surrounded by greenery."
,,A wonderful atmosphere,5.0,,"Having dragged my wife, on foot, around Singapore for most of the day we decided to take some quiet time I the park. It was beautiful and lovely to see people going about their daily lives in a natural environment, there were people just sitting, others walking dogs, a wedding party and dancers doing the flamenco....a great way to relax at the end of the day."
,,Love the tunnel and walking track,5.0,,"A huge park with Singapore river, Marina Bay Sands, Merlion and Singapore Flyer at the corner. Love the tunnel and walking/jogging track"
,,Battlebox closed due to H&S,4.0,,"Dear fellow Red Dot Explorers - saw reference to the WWII Labrador Tunnels (next door to me in Labrador Park) in an old edition of ""Mighty Minds Fun Singapore"". They and the Battlebox at Fort Canning seem to have been closed for ages so I made enquiries of the Singapore Tourist Board and National Parks Board.
Qu: I understand the both the Battlebox and the Labrador Tunnels have been closed for renovation. Are you able to give any indication as to when they will reopen?
Ans: Thank you for interest in Labrador Nature Reserve. Just to clarify, the Battlebox and tunnels in Labrador Nature Reserve are closed due to the public safety concern instead of renovation. The Battlebox and tunnels will be closed until further notice.
Wouldn't hold your breath, then....."
,,Ok for a quick visit,3.0,,The park was ok for a quick walk. We had come to visit the Battlebox but it was closed. The lighthouse was interesting.
,,Peaceful and historical,5.0,,"A piece of quiet amidst the throng of the city malls and food centres. Nice to walk before 1030am - shops arent open anyway. I entered via Hill St - opp is Liang shopping centre for a kopi tiam type breakfast, climb steps to hill and follow the maps - well laid out and explains historical milestones every 50 metres or so. It is truly an oasis and you can see people doing their taichi or chinese sowrd exercises in the morning - just a small group. Walk across to the musuem, and then cut across front lawn to Singapore Musuem, and then head to Bras Basah MRT. Its all within 10misn each leg. Brilliant. And good to exercise all the hawker food of the previous day before the next meal. It will probably be my daliy exercise park when I'm next in Singapore around that area."
,,A place for respite from the heat of the day.,5.0,,"Apart from having historical significance, keep your eyes and ears open whilst exploring. Bird calls abound. We also watched and photographed a small squirrel finding and eating an apple. There are plenty of signs to assist you as you explore. Steps are numerous and quite steep, but worth the climb. Don't forget your camera."
,,WW2 history,4.0,,"Excellent free attraction, short walk from our hotel, short steep climb to the top and pleasant stroll back - wanted to see the underground tunnels but these were closed for repair."
,,A place for history buffs,5.0,,"I tend to be drawn to places of historical significance, when when I found out about this place I immediately put it on my itinerary. Basically it is where the original colonial fort was located, and you can still see the remnants around the park, including the old gate as well as the lighthouse on Raffles Terrace, which was where ships entering the harbour would be signalled. The 'Battle Box', which was where the allied commanders during World War II would be bunkered down (though unfortunately it was closed when I visited). You can also find an archeological dig where they have found the ruins of a pre-colonial city. The park is also really tranquil to walk around, though you will find a number of signs talking about the historical aspects of the park. Oh, there is also an art gallery right in the middle (well, not quite in the middle because there is a reservoir there, but it is in the park nonetheless)."
,,Tranquil and surprising.,5.0,,A beautiful tranquil place to wander around and relax. The spice gardens are a real treat. The buildings and sculptures are amazing and great for photo opportunitites. When the Battle Box reopens it is well worth a visit.
,,Great for an early morning walk..,5.0,,"We were in the Clarke Quay area, so this park was literally across the road. It was great for the early morning walks / runs and from where we were, there was a serious set of stairs that would been a cardio work out for anyone.

Local history abounds in the place and you could either leisurely stroll around, or do the fitness thing.."
,,Green heart in Singapore,5.0,,The Fort Canning Park is a beautiful place to relax and to escape the business of Orchard Road. We spend some time in Fort Canning Hoel and used the park for our morning jogging activities.
,,Caution: Uphill,2.0,,This is our first stop. We were there around 8am. The wide canopy of trees bring shade and cool air. Be prepared for the uphill climb. We were contented with the view at Percival Road.
,,Night visit-still a great view,4.0,,"I was only able to visit right after sunset. I still got to read some interesting signs posted on the history of the park, as well as night views of the city. Hope to vgo again on my next trip during the daytime."
,,A park near Clark Quay,5.0,,A nice stroll in this park gives good views at the top of the hill by the fort. It's easily accessible from Clark Quay as its located just behind it.
,,Nice area for a walk,4.0,,This park is an historical site with a museum and a pleasant park. A nice contrast to the urban and noisy areas around. An additional bonus are the flights of stairs you can run up and down for exercise!
,,"Maritime Corner, at Fort Canning",4.0,,"Located in the middle of Singapore, the Maritime Corner at Fort Canning Park will gives you a new insight of the history of early port in this country. A great place for walking, enjoying fresh air and get away from the busy city of Singapore for a while"
,,A tranquil place across other side of busy Orchard Road....,3.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a sharp contrast to nearby busy Orchard Road.

The tranquility amidst the forested environment gives one a sense of peace and time just slowed down.
Take an unhurried stroll along the quiet beautiful park .There is history in this place, which one can learn so much about. Enjoy nature with the sound of birds & insects.

This place is up on the hill & not prominently visible from Orchard Road. Unless you are aware of this place, you probably won't even realise it is just a short walk on the other side of Orchard Road.

To get there, come out from Dhoby Ghaut MRT. Cross over to Park Mall
Shopping Centre. Take the lift here to Level 4. Turn right & exit into the carpark( glass door). Once in carpark, turn left & walk straight to car park exit ( about 10 lots away). From the car park exit, you can see Fort Canning Park across the road.

There is always a security guard at this car park exit, so please ask him/her if still unsure.

Definitely worth a visit here."
,,Get away from the city.,5.0,,Great location right in the middle of the city to get away from everyone and learn a little about the history of Singapore. Go early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the heat.
,,Take a walk or even jog through this park,5.0,,A beautiful park in the city lots of relics and history. Spent a hour or so wander around the park.. If you jog then I'd highly recommend it. Kids also enjoyed it. Very close to Clarke Quay if you are staying I that area.
,,The pride of Singapore,5.0,,"Nestling Accross the busy Orchard road is the walkers paradise Fort canning . The old house of Raffle - the founding father of Singapore is a nostalgic, delight . The fragrance of the Frangipani in the early hours awakens the senses .The enchanting fort canning is well spread in all sides - giving a clear view of the down town business district . There are four approach entrances with well connected public tranport bus stops . Beautiful restorant in the centre offers much welcome meals which are very exclusive but memorable . The museum , and the an old Dargah of the Muslim ruler are located in this park .Worthn making a trip .but , good walking shoes needed for the experience of walking a pleasure here ."
,,Nice garden full of spice. Nice hiking place.,3.0,,This was a paradise for taking wedding photographs. They also have a pretty wide collection of spices and condiments. Some people just go there to pluck the spices they need for cooking... like curry leaves and so on. It's a nice quite place for exploring nature and history of Singapore as well.
,,Singapore's First Botanic Garden Remains Tranquil and Lovely,4.0,,"A group of us walked through this beautiful park with the Maritime Trails organization. We saw the archaeologic digs, the cannon, Raffles house, the lighthouse, and gorgeous picnic areas. I will definitely visit this oasis of beauty regularly."
,,Nice Park,4.0,,"it was a really nice Park to walk around, Fort Canning was really interesting to look at, lovely kept Garden and Lawn and well worth a look, if you looking for something different to do."
,,Interest walk in beautiful park,4.0,,Very enjoyable walking tour. Giving information about history and also the flora. Very much local hangout spending pleasant days staying cool in the shade. Nice alternative if you do not have time for the Ridges.
,,Tranquil experience,5.0,,D Graves were over 200 yrs n beyond. Very pretty lawn. Its in between national meuseum and philosophy meuseum
,,A calm and serene place in the centre of the city,3.0,,Fort Canning park is located on a hill on the River valley road. The atmosphere here is just the opposite of what you find in the neighbourhood. It is extremely surprising to find this place this way when the Clarke quay next to it is full of life and noise. Anyway the walk is very nice and place is well maintained but nothing much to see here..If your trip is for 7 days or more you can visit this place .Does not merit a visit for shorter trips.
,,A Tranquil Park In The Heart Of The City!,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is located close to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station.

Its lush greenery offers a tranquil oasis where you are just minutes away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

Within its grounds are a wide big lawn where concerts/ music festivals/ performances are held, old military bunkers, and even a hotel housed in a historic building.

Its can be hilly at some points, so you will have to climb stairs to get around.

This is a nice park to visit, that's located in the heart of the city!"
,,Cool calm and peaceful,5.0,,"A great place to learn some history and escape from the bustle of the city, watch out for squirrels. :-). Aim for 4-5 to start when its cooler and the best place to get up the hill is behind the museum."
,,Nice walk and a history lesson,3.0,,Fort Canning is a former location for royalty to live and was turned into a fort used to defend the country. It is a low stress hike/walk and has a few panels to read about the history of Singapore. They occasionally have a concert in the park but they can get crowded. This isn't a must see attraction but if you are sightseeing in the Clark Quay area give it a shot.
,,"Good, if you want to see some green space in the concrete jungle",4.0,,"Good place to break a tour although the steps and the climb up are a bit of a killer. Once up there, you are in a very beautiful, peaceful world and there are good toilets and refreshments. I agree, it is probably not worth a special trip."
,,Nice escape right in the city,4.0,,Nice for a touch of rain forrest and history right by the city. Maybe not worth a dedicated visit but well worth a stroll if nearby.
,,Relax and disappear,5.0,,"This area is so relaxing for a long slow stroll or a quick pace for exercise. View's nature, gardens, history. Very safe."
,,"Fort Canning Park, Singapore",5.0,,"A once British fort that overlooked the harbour of Singapore now redone as a city park. Most of the buildings have long gone but some walls and cannons remain along with the lighthouse, signal mast and time ball. The many park trees and nearby skyscrapers now block the view but it's still worth taking a couple of hours to stroll around this peaceful place and to read the notices that give you the history of Singapore."
,,"Historic, Interesting",5.0,,The 'Battle Box' Museum is fascinating and well worth the visit. Nice park and gardens. Close enough to walk from other interesting locations.
,,History is well preserved!,5.0,,"This place is hidden in the middle of the city contains full of history, stories and other hidden jems. During WW2 this place is used to protect Singapore against the Japanese. It also where you can find the original botanic garden that Raffles build. And there also a cemetery that is now used for concerts and orchestra. It amazed me how this fort is well preserved through Singapore changes. 1 day ill come back there again with my daughter and my wife. :)"
,,Pretty but plenty of mosquitos.,4.0,,The place was a nice visit. Middle of the city and easy to get to from the Bras Basah MRT. Be careful of mosquitos. Bringing something like citronella might help.
,,Enjoyable park in the city,4.0,,We walked around this pretty large park during our trip to Singapore. It is situated on a hill and has several trails. The trees were quite impressive and the scenery was pretty. There was a wedding going on in one portion of the park.
,,Singapore hidden gem! Enjoy the beauty of Ft Canning! Walk or Run!,5.0,,"I lived in Singpaore for a year and spent every weekend walking/running around this beautiful and historic site. Ft. Canning was the highest point in Singapore and dates back centuries with some of the most interesting stories. There are three different levels of paved pathways that wrap around the area of Fort Canning. Each level represents a different centuries and cultural challenges of their times. Some of the views like the one you can encounter at Raffles house are really neat. Stop by Raffles house which has 3 large flag poles which were used to signal merchant ships coming into Singapore.

The pathways are great for running/walking as they are paved wide and some of trails go through narrow paths which make you feel like you are in a jungle. The general pathway around the top is easy to walk for seniors or kids but the harder trails that will challenge a runner are lower and rise to the top level. The nice part of running there is you can challenge yourself to different levels and stairs or just limit your run to the top which has limited stairs. If you have young kids or seniors consider taking a taxi to the top of the main Fort.
Most of the area is shade so it is a nice break from the sun and make sure you bring water. There are plenty of water stations but a little hard to find. The 2 World War history is interesting but limited but it is interesting to see the Sally ports & gates were the British surrendered to the Japanese. There is not much to see in terms of an old fort as the area is only what has been left and not restored into a tourist trap.
The kids will like the cannons next to Ft. Fort. At the very top is best place for taking pictures and you will a lot of brides & grooms having there pictures taken.
Just a warning about the stairs on the walk to the top there are a lot of them but again you can avoid them by taking a taxi to the top. Their are numerous entry & exit points around the fort that can drop you off in various parts of the city to explore.
The general pathway around the top is easy to walk for seniors or kids but the harder trails that will challenge a runner are lower but I found running them all was great but what a work out on the stairs! If you have kids or seniors consider taking a taxi to the top of the main Fort.
What I also enjoyed about Ft Canning was it was not a tourist trap and not been commercialized. Hope you enjoy this beautiful place!"
,,One of My Favorites,5.0,,"I read about Fort Canning in one of those Top 10 Guides. The guide (which was wrong about many things) recommended a 2 to 3 hour visit. I thought...OK...an hour. Well, I was there for 3 hours and could have stayed longer except I was thirsty (bring water). It was a beautiful, quiet, and restful place to visit (on a Saturday Morning, no less). There is no entry fee and it is a great place to learn about Singapore's historical beginnings from the 13th through 19th century. I recommend following the 14th Century Walk. It was beautiful and fascinating."
,,Historical park,4.0,,"This is something what I really recommend! It is not even take long time to walk it from start to the end. I was there maybe 2 hours, just walked around and take some pictures.. there is something for history lovers - signs what tell you what happened in Singapore and in which decade. It is actually very interesting.
There is one very old gate (sorry can't remember name..), you can go up to that gate. There is small hole where you need to go and just take stairs up. There is beautiful view :)"
,,Everything we went for was closed,2.0,,"We went to the park because my husband was interested in the WW2 history - the visitors centre was shut for renovations and the battle box was closed too. We could not access anything we went for, so it was a waste of time for us."
,,Peaceful Place in City Center,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is worth for a few hours tour, maybe it doesn't have too much attractive sights, but this is a very quiet place. When you walk through the path in the park, you can hear birds twittering around you. Local people jogging in park. It's quite nice place if you want to jump out from busy life.
By the way, it is easy to access to National Museum from the Park."
,,secret entrance to top of the watch tower,4.0,,"behind the heavy door into the watch tower, there is a small entrance that reveals stairs that lead to the top of the watch tower. not much view to speak of, but nice to find a different angle to see the place. each step is very high though, be careful when going up and down.

good for jogging too, but not much sheltered spots if it rains."
,,Wonderful relaxing walk in the middle of the city.,5.0,,Take about an hour and stroll the walks through this park. Take your time and enjoy some beautiful foliage. We did the walk after we visited the National Musuem. We excited at Clark Quay and then walked across the street to take the river boat ride. It was very relaxing and there are lots of shady areas.
,,Amazing green and historic place in the heart of the city center,4.0,,"A beautiful spot right in the middle of the busy city center. Fort Canning Park is an ideal place for walking, enjoying nature and to catch a breath from the busy city life. This place has quite some historic value. First accounts of habitation date back to the 14th century. Lots of important people lived here (for example Raffles himself). There are remnants of fortifications and there even is a bunker dug out in the hill. You can also admire the old lighthouse that once guided ships into the harbor of Singapore or go on two different walks which offer some interesting background information about the history of this hill. Nature lovers will be pleased too, lots of gorgeous, beautiful trees and flowers. There is even a spice garden for those who love to cook.

When I visited Fort Canning Park, the Fort Canning Center was being renovated, but I'll expect the renovation will be finished by summer for the celebrations of 50 years Singapore. Sadly I wasn't possible to enter the bunker and corridors dug out in the hill at this time."
,,Interesting spot,5.0,,"I really enjoyed this. The history, the park and the various views. It takes a while to take in everything but if you don't mind walking- you will enjoy it. It's very well maintained ( as to be expected) and would suit all ages."
,,Lush!,5.0,,This is one of my favourite places in Singapore. It is a lovely place to learn about the history and is spectacular and green. The graveyard is a serene place and gives a fantastic insight into the British Colonization of Singapore.
,,Green tranquil space,4.0,,"Extremely well tended park with interpretive boards.

You can tell that Singapore put a lot of effort into preserving this place. Made me very happy to be here.

It can be quite steep to get from bottom to top, but to surround yourself in this wonderful green space is worth it."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Worth the visit of this green , peaceful park based around an early English settlement. Well maintained and with very good signage that both helps you move round the site and also provides a lot of information on Singapore history.

Allow 1-2 hours for the visit and be prepared for walking up and down steps. Lots of trees and very green.

I often take visitors from the rush of Orchard road (Dhoby Ghaut MRT) via the park (green and quiet) and walk to Clarke Quay (or vice versa). This gives a view of different aspects of Singapore, plus a bit of history with some exercise ..then you have earned a beer at Clarke Quay.!"
,,Beautiful greenery in Singapore,5.0,,"Went to this park for a wedding ceremony. Definitely worth a visit and walk around, the greenery is awe inspiring."
,,Tranquility,4.0,,"I encourage all travellers to find 1 - 2 hours to stroll around Fort Canning Park. Very tranquil and a fascinating insight into Singapore's history, particularly during the 2nd World War. Lovely place for a picnic too. Easy walking, no steep hills and very shaded."
,,Terriffic overview of early Singapore,5.0,,"A ""must see"" area of Singapore history, notably of early English settlement. A vast amount of earthworks done here over time particularly the levelling of the top of this hill to create a 7 acre flat building area in the 1860's (no machines in that time, only man power). An interesting 1-2 hours wandering around imagining a past era. Well signed with information."
,,Historic site,4.0,,We stumbled upon the fort as we were walking towards Raffles Hotel. The stairs leading up were a bit of a climb but manageable. The views from the top are quite good in place but the trees do hide some of it away. Some of the buildings on the hill are being renovated so we couldn't see as much as we would have liked. Still worth a visit
,,"History, Tranquility, and a bit of view too",4.0,,"I wanted to check out the vistas from Fort Canning on my last day in SIN. As it turned out I had the park more of less to myself because I was strolling through in the midst of a torrential rainstorm. Quite frankly the tranquility in the hard rain made for a lovely diversion from the urban activity below. Fort Canning isn't terribly high and there is a reservoir on most of the top of the hill anyways, but there was a good view looking onto Clarke Quay and the Central Business District too. Wandering the paths I learned a few things about Singapore's history from multilingual display boards dotting the paths. On the back side of the hill there (opposite the Clarke Quay park entrance) was a historic lighthouse lamp that once had been atop Fort Canning. That was very interesting maritime history
It should be noted that the Battle Box museum seems to be closed indefinitely for some renovations. I was hoping for a chance to see the Battle Box, but the entrance is sealed off with a notice. Otherwise, there was a lot renovating going on with the old military buildings in the park. Give yourself a bit over an hour to leisurely saunter around and savor the green elevated island of tranquility."
,,Lovely greenery and flowers and trees and old remains,4.0,,"The greenery was just amazing, its a green gem right in the middle of the city. You got a bit of a climb to go up tot he old fort. Reccomend late evening to watch the sunset or go jogging through the curving paths up and down hill. The trees and the green grass on the top is great for a picnic as well. Just to forge the cement buildings and pretend to be in a jungle is just lovely :)"
,,An oasis of history.,5.0,,"Fort Canning park is a wonderful oasis in the heart of the city. Whether it is history, nature, exercise or a combination of all three then the park is the place to go. Seeing the old fortifications, the trees and the lack of people all around makes it very different from the average tourist time in Singapore. This is not to be missed if only as a chance to de-retail. Read a little about it beforehand and you'll enjoy it even more."
,,A glimpse of history,4.0,,"The park is the only real hill on the island and is an oasis above the busy traffic and hectic cafe and bar scene. It can feel a stiff climb in the heat but it is worth it for the views, for the greenery and for the history."
,,Peace and quiet in the center,5.0,,"A lovely place near the Singapore museum and its great for a 1 hour stroll in the nature. Also has some very informative boards with interesting historical facts. The park has several entrances and exits, to all sides of the city, which is very convenient."
,,Peace and Calm,4.0,,"On a Monday morning with few people around, the park was an oasis of calm and beauty. There were certainly more species of bird around that present in the Botanic gardens over the preceding weekend. Plenty of trees and shade to get some respite from the sun.
The only downside was that the Battle Box museum was not open. A group of architecural surveyors entered whilst we were there and we were advised it would not be open until the end of 2015."
,,Peaceful place to pass a couple of hours,4.0,,"We wandered around this park for a couple of hours and really enjoyed the tranquility.
The spice garden is lovely and smells delicious!
We visited on a Sunday afrernoon and saw many locals and tourists enjoying picnics along the banks. We even came across a wedding ceremony!
There were a few disappointments in that some parts are closed off or gated up in a not very attractive manner but the place is so big you hardly notice.
Parts of the park are very hilly/steep so bring your walking shoes for these hills and the many many steps!"
,,A Well maintained park,3.0,,"I am lucky enough to stay in front of fort canning park for almost an year. The park is very well maintained. While walking though the park , you can read about the singapore history details. You can find lot of big trees and feel the forest.
The place is also good more morning and evening jogging, as the park has lot of steps to climb and places to exercise. if you enjoy nature, this is a must visit place."
,,An Oasis...,4.0,,"A bit fed up with the high rise building site that is Singapore, we sought out Fort Canning Park, and what a treat it was. Mrs. Flyingbluedog heavily into cooking and the Spice Garden there was a treat for her! Must admit I enjoyed it too, being able to touch and sniff the plants.
Some nice gentle walks around the reservoir at the top (not visible and fenced off with barb wire topped chain link ‚ÄìI guess it‚Äôs Sings main source of water.)
Sounds of all the different birds were delightful, all that seemed to be missing from the rest of Sing.
Planting was lush and many of the plants were labelled comprehensively and this helped us to enjoy it all the more, enhancing the whole experience.
There were no refreshments available as the kiosk was being rebuilt.
This was an oasis of calm before descending back into Sing."
,,Quiet place lies in the center of the city,4.0,,"Unlike Botanic Garden, which is located a little bit far from the city center, this place lies right in the heart of the city. Used to be an army fort, now this place is really quiet and covered with so many tree. A good place to walk and relieve any stress."
,,Singapore's real history in one place,5.0,,Take the 14th century walk. It is self-guided and easy to understand. Fort canning was once a palace surrounded by water and its form justifies it. That is why it has steep stairs. It is also the ultimate proof that Singapore's natives were malays. This hailed land also carries the transition of hinduism to Islam when Islam came about in Singapore in the 14th century. This place should be visited and studied not only by tourists but also recommended for Singaporeans themselves.
,,Most of the sites under renovation,3.0,,"As others mention here, there are many of the sites in this lovely park that are under renovation, hence we didn't really get the experience we had hoped for. The park itself is lovely and nice to walk around. One of many green oasis in Singapore."
,,battle box open,4.0,,"There`s a lot of people on here complaining about the fact that the Battle Box seems to be closed indefinitely. Well it may be to the general public who just want to go there on a one off trip. HOWEVER if you book the excellent ""Fog of War"" trip through the Historical Society of Singapore, it includes entry to the Battle Box with a guide along with many other military positions visited.
I found them through a leaflet in hotel reception to do with The Changi Museum, booked both of the trips on offer & was pleased with them both, gave me a break from wandering round endless shopping malls with her indoors!!!!"
,,Nature and history,5.0,,"Great place to relax and picnic.

History: Battle box - WW2 bunker (under renovation til late 2015), 9 pound cannon from 19th C, archaeological digging site, old Fort gate.

Nature: lots of different tree species, as well as a spice garden, among other things.

Art: different sculptures"
,,"Fresh air, fun, exercise, nature and history",5.0,,"While the visitor's centre and the battle bunker are closed, this does not mean there is nothing to see here! There are plenty of historic sights to see at this park. You can also enjoy the beautiful plants, and read the signage at points of interest. You'll find this place a good location to get some exercise and some fresh air. We enjoyed visiting the site of the 1860s fort, the 14th century site, and we took part of the 14th century walk. We saw a few lizards and squirrels.

We tried to walk here from Dhoby Ghaut MRT, but we had trouble finding the underpass. Its still easy to get across the road though.

After our visit we went to the Fabulous Baker Boy for our lunch."
,,fort canning,4.0,,"A great place for the long peaceful walk. A charming and clean park, it is no wonder many couples come here for their wedding photo shoot."
,,Park of a different kind,4.0,,A very nice place just next to Orchard. Good Place to relax and have a small picnic. A very good walk also for couples. I would suggest carrying some food and drinks and there are very less options available inside. Some construction work in going on at the moment.
,,Worth a stroll,4.0,,Quite a nice park to go for a casual stroll & take some time to chill out from the city. It's very humid though (like all of Singapore).
,,Worth too see,4.0,,"We did a walk around the park and found it enjoyable.
It was very peaceful area considering that it's in the city.
Walkways were very clean and tidy, the stairs from the bottom to the top was manageable.
Great place to go if you like parks & history."
,,Charming city centre park,5.0,,"The sign of a good city is the amount of green space it sets aside for people to take a break from their hectic lives. For a small island-state Singapore has done magnificently to ensure its citizens are within a short stroll of greenery, and rightly deserves the title of 'garden city'. Fort Canning
Park epitomises this ethos. Whenever we are in Singapore we ensure we have at least one visit to the park as it embraces so many features. There are beautifully laid out paths, giant mature trees and shrubs, historic artefacts in an historic setting, old colonial buildings beautifully restored to their former glory, a burial ground, a lighthouse, wildlife, sculptures, and it's elevated position affords great views of the surrounding high rise buildings. We usually spend a few hours here just wondering up and down the various paths taking in the sights, sounds and fresh smells if visiting after a rain shower (but avoid thundery weather). On our latest visit the park can alive with the sound of school children enjoying an educational visit. The park authorities are to be congratulated for their ongoing maintenance of such an historic site. If visiting Singapore, and you tire of business or shopping then I recommend heading for Fort Canning to recharge your batteries."
,,worth a visit,5.0,,"a must is to visit the 'battle Box' where a mock up of the British Army's operation centre at the time of the Japanese invasion is available to walk through and learn the history involved. There are many exhibits, all underground."
,,MEMORY HILL,4.0,,"Located on a hill, Fort Canning Park is on 18-hectare space is chock full of attractions is one of Singapore's most historic landmarks. Today, Fort Canning Park distinctive charm remains. Its ancient artifacts are a must-see for history buffs, and its lush greenery and expansive lawns offer a variety of arts, heritage and nature experiences. The outdoor lawns draw picnics, concerts, theatre productions and festivals, while weddings, parties and gatherings are a regular sight in the park's elegant indoor function rooms, and more recently, some of the world‚Äôs biggest music acts played to screaming audiences. Some highlights include the Maritime Corner which tells the story of Singapore's evolution from an entrepot trading post to an international maritime centre, and the Fort Gate, is a great entrance experience a remnant of a fortress built in the 19th Century. the Spice Garden, the ASEAN Sculpture Garden and Battle Box is worth the visit, the park is Situated in central Singapore, the hill leads down to the famous shopping belt of Orchard Road, while the National Museum sits just behind, accessible by an escalator. It‚Äôs worth the stroll around the hill."
,,Interesting and historical,5.0,,"I walked to Fort Canning from the hotel. Start early , carry water and have an umbrella. The area is very big and takes time to see it all. You need to be somewhat fit and you need to walk up a steep hill. The pathways are well maintained . When I went there was only one other person that I saw and a couple but Singapore is so safe , you should feel ok. There are a number of workers there , so that's a comfort. For a woman, I would go with someone as it can be quite isolated. Unfortunately, the old HQ and bunker was under renovations but one could visualize what it would have been like during the war when the Brits and allied troops were surrounded . I would start at the north end and then you would end up downtown and are able to see other sights. Watch for any thunderclouds for all the signs say to get off the hill if there is a storm. Every day when we were there , there were fierce storms that last from 1 to 2 hrs. On another day, I went to the Fort (which is really a park) at the entrance near the old police station on Hill St. right beside the river. You can see the original light house and there is a nice park like atmosphere. People were walking and having lunch etc. Everything is so well maintained."
,,Great place to get married,3.0,,I suppose the nearest Metro station is Dhoby Gaout. 10 mins walk and you enter the Park walking up the steps going through the Fort Canning hotel. Very elegant hotel with chic lobby. The Park itself apart from few historical sites has very little to offer. There are nicer parks in Singapore.
,,Fulfilled a need for some bucolic solace,4.0,,"Now and then one just needs some peace and quiet, paths to roam and fresh air. I arrived at the park on the Clark Quay side and the steps up to the reservoir are a little bit daunting but worth the climb to then wander the pathways and enjoy the greenery.

Nothing exciting here. Just a peaceful parkland area - which is sometimes all one needs."
,,Wow Factor,5.0,,"A very pleasant place to visit. Hard to believe a place like this was shelled and involved in a war back in 1942. Our visit here was 2009 and after just getting off the plane the day before, it offered a cooler climate to the heat due to the vegetation. Must visit and will be back."
,,Peaceful escape,4.0,,"This is a good choice when you need some peace and quiet and don't want to travel too far from the city area. Bit of a hike to get there, but once you're actually at Fort Canning it's easy enough to walk around."
,,Nice But No Hyde Or Central Park,3.0,,"There are a number of famous parks that are smacked right in the city center. Hyde Park and Central Park are two. In comparison with these, Fort Canning is missing a pond, fountain, more shelters, caf√© and drink fountains, and events. In recent times, concerts at FC are rare. Situated on a hill, few visitors use the park as a shortcut from one side to another side whilst savouring the flora and fauna, just like at Central or Hyde Park. Imagine you will need to go up and down the numerous stairs on a humid day. Occasionally one can find wildlife - chameleon, snakes, wild pheasants and civets. It is also an excellent joggling trial. The air is fresh and cityscapes breath-taking during a sunset jog-through. Guests at the Hotel Fort Canning would love this park. Although Singapore is branded as a clean and green city, I found a number of paths littered with rubbish and empty cans. I have always wondered how the experience will be enhanced if the shelters and paths are equipped with moist sprays to keep temperature down ! Check National Parks website for any events. The nearest subway is Clarke Quay MRT. Battle Box and the Fort Canning Art Center are closed for renovation. There is a 100-year old reservoir at the top of the hill. The sculpture park next to it is desolate and ""lonely"". Visit FC to include the Hotel, Battle Box when opened, the Fort Canning Cemetery, the MICA arts building (old Hill Street Police Station), Karamat shrine, the Central Fire Station, Stamp Museum, Peranakan Museum and Armenian Church, all within 3-4 hours or so."
,,Nice to be away from the real city,4.0,,"Nice green area, on a hill, so be prepared for ups and downs!. Spice garden, sculpture area, some old cannons and others buildings plus an archaeological dig. Lots of guidance points and directions around the park. Easily walkable to parts of the city."
,,A wonderful Park,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a Park built around the place wher Stamfort Raffles built his house. The Park contains a spice garden, a water reservois, a hotel complex, a small sculpture park and a bunker complex of WW2. In case rain shows there a couple of places to take shelter. Warning signs indicate not to enter the park during or shortly after a storm - but who would ?! The only drawback i found was the public toilets. Due zo construction works, these are more....mobile ones as on construction sites..."
,,Peaceful Park missing the History,3.0,,"This is a beautiful and peaceful park with little crowds BECAUSE a fort is best served on a hill so the location does mean some walking and the main roads and stairs can make it difficult to get to including from the MRT station Dhobby Gaut.

Disappointly the battle box is closed and the main building under rennovation plus otehr parts fenced off. You can see the battle box entrance, story baord plus fort gates and it is free to visit. Because of the greenery, it gets very humid there so be prepared.

IWANTED TO GIVE THIS 4-5 STAR RATING BUT UNTIL THE BATTLE BOX IS RESTORED AND RE-OPENED IT MISSES THE HISTORY, NO REAL CANNONS OR HISTORICAL ARTIFACTS."
,,Huge free park in the middle of Singapore,4.0,,We enjoyed a relaxing walk in Fort Canning Park after seeing Orchard Road. The park is huge and can take a couple of hours to walk around. We particularly enjoyed the spice garden!
,,Lovely park - Battle Box closed though,4.0,,Nice park to spend a few hours walking round. Lots of plants to see and old structures to look at. Sadly the Battle Box is closed for refurbishment.
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Spend a few leisurely hours wandering around this garden admiring all the wonderful plants. The old relics are interesting, loved the steep staircase above the old gate."
,,A good way to admire nature,4.0,,The area around YWCA Fort Canning Lodge is made pleasant by the scenery of Fort Canning Park. One feels like walking down memory lane while admiring the nature around Fort Canning Park.
,,Battle Box - Still Closed,1.0,,"Renovations!!
Battle Box is still closed.

I went to the Battle Box in May 2013 and it was closed for ""minor works""
I went there again in August 2014 and still closed.

Many thousands of British tourists come to Singapore every month with many looking to see where their relatives fought and died during WW2.

Singapore get your act together this really is very poor!!."
,,Peaceful escape,5.0,,"Green, quiet and tranquil, this was the first botanic garden to be created so it's full of lovely plantlife. We visited on a Sunday and found it occupied by families enjoying picnics, old men doing tai chi, young couple strolling. It is a huge park so you can always find a corner to yourself to chill out in. There are toilets etc. There is quite a flight of steps to get into the park but it is worth the climb."
,,Civilized Jungle,5.0,,"In Singapore there is a large park on the hill which once was important for the security and governing of the island. Now it is the most wonderful walking park with many paths and plants (trees, flowers, etc.) that thrive in the tropics. Allow yourself several hours to enjoy this park. It is good to start at the Herb Garden and see all the many spices that once made Singapore the popular commercial center it is today. Then a little farther up the trail there is an archeological excavation which describes a lot of the history of the ""fort"". Beyond that are vegetation of all types as you circle around the hill. The views of the city in every direction are outstanding. Although it does not get much press, this is a very worthwhile place to put in a few hours."
,,Refreshing!,5.0,,"Its a long walk but worth every step. Very refreshing and once you reach the top, the view is amazing. Centre of singapore and well maintained."
,,Good history and morning excercise,5.0,,Park contains organised tours through the war bunkers. Also a great park to do morning jogs around. Very fresh air at the park within inner city.
,,Great morning run!,5.0,,"Smacked in the heart of the city, Fort Canning Park is definitely a must-visit when in SG.

It's a good place for a morning stroll or run. I enjoyed running and exploring around and at the same time, it was also interesting to learn more about the history of singapore."
,,Serene beauty,4.0,,Took a stroll through this park and learned a little history and enjoyed the spice/herb garden. Even found a wandering rooster.
,,Great Place,4.0,,"A hidden gem in Singapore, just walk around and take in the history of the place. Raffles built his home here. The WW2 Battle Box is located here. The old Grave yard is also here. A must see and do."
,,Nice place in the afternoon,4.0,,"Its near Dhoby Gaut station. Near from Cathay cinema. Need to walk to reach this place. Its very convenient environment. There are many trees in here. You will enjoy this place. Its historic place either, inside there have underground called 'battle box'."
,,Fantastic place to spend an afternoon,5.0,,"Fort Canning Park is just a short walk from Orchard Road and goes all the way to Clarke Quay. So it is right in the center of the city and you can walk in from either of these two places. I like to walk from Orchard and end at Clarke Quay for lunch or dinner. There are amazing trees and plants in the park. I have been to Fort Canning Park probably a dozen times, but I have never actually explored the fort areas of the park. The nature is what draws me in. There are a couple of absolutely colossal Banyan trees and some other trees that I don't know the names of. There is a tree that spans a football field that is just down the hill directly below the lighthouse. It is amazing, and I attach a pic I took that doesn't do it justice. It is one of my favorite places in Singapore and I love spending an afternoon or morning in the park. Free to enter as usual in Singapore."
,,An interesting walk!,5.0,,"I was told about this park & had to visit..after climbing loads of steps on the City side...had a lovely view from the top over parts of the city below. loved the various trees (some huge) & lovely plants...a very well kept park....i went on quite a hot & humid day...so that had some disadvantages lol..sweating lots!!..got to the old Fort area & that was worth a walk around, enjoyed the huge gateway (see photo)..I'm glad i visited this park must....i then walked through the Gateway, walking down hill, which took me past the Fort Canning hotel...(i would certainly consider staying here for a few nights). I would certainly recommend this park...however i was approached a few times by beggers..i was on my own...so maybe go with someone!!"
,,A mixture,3.0,,"Was here in November 2013, during my walk around Fort Canning Park there is a variety of trees and vegetation. I was really interested in the Battle Box in the park. If you read other reviews it is closed, but you can see the entrance into the fortification and other parts that are visible above ground. I would definitely recommend that you be a regular walker or have good fitness levels, there are a lot of stairs to fully explore this area.

Also pick the time of day you go, I was caught in a tropical rain shower in the late afternoon. However I did enjoy the walk around Fort Canning."
,,Nice park,4.0,,"It is a nice for a stroll or run, and they have theatre in the open air quite often too. If you are looking for a good workout, try running up the many sets of stairs!"
,,An overlooked gem,5.0,,I come to Singapore regularly but it was only recently that I discovered Fort Canning Park -recommended to me by a resident. Now I never miss it. There it is right in the middle of downtown. A green oasis and well explained history to see too. Especially good if you don't have much time and want to stretch your legs.
,,A real treasure amidst modern town,5.0,,It's almost unbelievable there's an old place hiding among this modern city of Singapore! The place is right behind the Clarke Quay tourist attraction. Walking through lush & green garden all the way up to an ancient gate is an amazing experience. Many big tropical trees are fruiting in June and many flowers are blooming. This nature trail is really worth my time.
,,Fort Canning Park - What a surprise!,4.0,,"This attraction is the least any tourists would look into. I, too, stumbled upon this place while looking out for a nearby MRT to reach home. It's a vast park, be prepared to give 2 hours to it to see her beauty, bask into her serenity and understand the history behind the place.

It's next to the Central Fire Station on Hill Street, hence the entrance is easily overlooked because of the big open space in front that looks more like a resting place. The steps were the ones that attracted me to probe further in, to find out what was actually on top. It was in the evening around 5.45pm. Sorry folks, no elevators, but vehicles could be driven right up to the Raffles House, which now is opened for private social function bookings.

Take your time to climb up the many steps; else you would be breathless by the time you reach the second level (by the way, there are so many entries/exits you have to discover which ones you like for re-visits).

The first lighthouse was built there and the importance of its presence to guide the seamen into and out of the ports, before the skyscrapers in front blocked the sea views. Sir Raffles built his house there. It was not so much of the history, but the landscaping of the rainforest trees that were really mesmerising. If only trees could speak....

Well, enough for disclosing this much, go for the discovery. This one is definitely for nature lovers, not shopaholics."
,,Nice Green Space,5.0,,"I didn't plan to visit fort canning Park while I stayed in Singapore. It was coincidence, I walked nowhere and found stairway to hill near by clarke quay. I took a step and walked there. I knew that the name of this place is fort canning later. The park is really green and we can find some historical site. It was nice afternoon walk and I could see Singapore down town as a background behind the tree. Cool place to sit and relax."
,,A breath of nature and history surrounded by city.,4.0,,"Had my morning walk at Fort Canning Park this Vesak public holiday.
I walked from Dorby Ghaut Mrt to Penang Road then to Clemenceau Ave which take around 10min. It is actually just behind of Park Mall.
Realised also that Fort Canning Park is also accessible from City Hall and Clarke Quay Mrt!
A very nice exposure for me with friends back to nature and the past.For me,it is different from other nature park with extra sense of historical background! A gem in the city!"
,,Nice step in the past,3.0,,It is a nice park which let you step in the past of the island. There is also a nice view from the top.
,,A nice public park with history,5.0,,"A little climb, yet the history, tranquillity and views of Singapore through the trees are well worth it."
,,Awesome Place to spend a day,5.0,,"Fort Canning park is a nicely landscaped place featuring walk paths through thick green gardens with a variety of botanical arrangements. It also features a WWII history museum called the Battle Box, which is a must watch. They have put mannequins from the company who does these for madame tussauds museum. They are placed in several WWII situations. We were lucky to have found a historian there who had a firm grasp of all those events and our visit turned out to be more fun and educative."
,,Wonderful example of Singapore's greenery,4.0,,"One of my favourite green spaces in Singapore is Fort Canning Park, which is located just behind Clarke Quay and Boat Quay on the Singapore River. Fort Canning was a fort during World War 2 and still remnants of the time remain for you to explore, including the Battle Box, which is an indoor history of the time period, although this is not free, it is nonetheless a good addition to the park.

I have never seen any monkeys at Fort Canning, either, which is a good thing! What you can see, however, are little reminders on the fencing that some of Fort Canning Park is off limits to the public, as some military exercises are still undertaken at the summit.

All in all, Fort Canning Park is a lovely green park through which to stroll for an hour or two. There are ample picnic areas, if you want to bring a snack or two, but remember to leave nothing behind. There is also a little snack bar at the foot of the park, but it is not always open. Be aware that there is nowhere safe to shelter from thunder and lightning at Fort Canning Park, as there are lots of high trees which can be a safety hazard, and although the park is not as big as say Bukit Timah or Mount Faber Park, you should still check the weather forecast before you go, just to be on the safe side."
,,A lovely compact park,4.0,,"Canning Park has the advantage of being easily reached and is blessed with a range of lovely views of parts of Singapore. Being in the tropics the lawns are truly lush and the plants overflowing with vitality.

What this park has that sets it a little apart from, say, the very impressive Botanical Gardens in the same city is that it has a range of points of historical interest. These range from parts of the old fort, to the large Canning Centre which is used for exhibits, to the 'Battle Box' which was the British HQ in World War 2 and also to exhibits of archaeological aspects of Singapore.

Furthermore if you are keen you can attack this early in the morning from the opposite side of the part to the National Museum and, after your stroll, enjoy the air conditioned amenities of aforesaid museum. In fact the truly keen could then move from there to the Singapore Art Museum and thence (if their brain isn't overloaded with facts by that point) to the Peranakan Museum.

Highly recommended."
,,relaxing stroll,2.0,,It was a nice walk through although be prepared to walk up alot of stairs. Would have been better if there wasnt so many attractions closed for maintenance.
,,Nice setting but horrible staff,2.0,,"We were really surprised at how small the rooms are. The ""star architect"" who designed the place should have known better to make ONE big room instead of two tiny ones, maybe then the bathtub would not have had to be on the balcony!
One more negative point was that the walls are not sound proof. You can hear everything your neighbors do and say and consider they can hear you too!

We were disappointed about the hotel management as well because we felt that guests were treated like a burden for the hotel staff. We were never greeted or even acknowledged, instead the receptionist was busy rolling his eyes at us whenever we asked about normal things like where the breakfast is located.

The sink in our room was badly damaged and we told the reception three times to fix it. But nothing was done during our 7 night stay.
It's a pity because this hotel has plenty to offer. Two big pools in a green sunny garden, a very good restaurant and the wonderful Fort Canning park which is a quiet oasis in the heart of the city at any time of the day.

If you like to walk you can reach big shopping malls, the Orchard road, Marina bay or Clarke Quay in 10 to 20 minutes by foot. In the late evening the hotel offers a sundowner with different types of wine for free in the lush garden. With a motivated staff it could be a good place especially in the beautiful setting.

So overall we cannot recommend this hotel considering the attitude and lack of motivation of the staff and management and the unpractical room layout."
,,Nothing overly interesting,3.0,,Nothing too interesting here in Fort Canning Park. There are some amazing trees which look like they would be hundreds of years old - it would have been great to have some information on them because they were very impressive! There is a lot of shade in this park and we also saw a few runners. Nice varied terrain for a run.
,,garden above the city,4.0,,"Basically above the city this garden is another place to escape the city. Like botanical garden and the southern ridges. Don't expect any exotic plants. It's more like a quiet place to hang out.
On the northern side of the park, behind the National Museum of Singapore there is a escalator to go up to the gardens."
,,Great garden,4.0,,They have lots of shades so it is not so hot. There is also a spice garden where you can see some tropical spices in South East Asia. I had a run in this park and it was so pleasant!
,,"Trees, Tradition and Tranquility",5.0,,"I will never look at trees the same way again. Not after touring with Yap and Teck Seng, both volunteer guides, through Fort Canning. Besides talking about the history of the park (former residence of Malayan Kings, the Forbidden Hill, British stronghold, Botanical Garden, etc.), they also brought to life the true spectacles of the park: the giant trees, flowers and plants that have played witness to the park's history.

Their passion, knowledge and enthusiasm about the park, its history, and the beautiful grounds is absolutely mesmerizing. I can't think of any other way to describe it. One can't help but be drawn in by their stories.

Fort Canning is one of the highest points in Singapore. From atop the park, you have a bird's eye view of Clark Quay and the city skyline. It‚Äôs incredibly convenient to get to via Dhoby Gaut MRT or Bra Basah MRT. Based on one of the guest‚Äôs comments, public transport is probably easier as he had difficulty finding nearby parking.

My tour highlights include:
- Fort Canning Gate - try opening/closing it by yourself. It is HEAVY!
- Heritage Trees
- Keramat Iskandar Sha
- Sir Raffles former home
- The reservoir
- Learning about how figs get propagated (absolutely fascinating)
- The archaeological dig

A few tips:
- Plan to visit for at least hours
- Sign up for one of the FREE Saturday afternoon tours on the park's website: http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/index.php?option=com_visitorsguide&task=parks&id=16&Itemid=75
- Bring a bottle of water (there are no water fountains around)
- Bring mosquito repellent

I hope that when you schedule your tour, you also have the pleasure of touring with Yap and Teck Seng.

By the way, did I mention the tour is FREE?"
,,Splendid View of Singapore from Fort Canning Park,4.0,,"You can start your tour of Fort Canning Park via the National Museum pathway entrance or at this location from Hill Street - entrance is next the Ministry of Communication (former Hill Street Police Station building)...it will bring you up to the Raffles Terrace. I recommend you start the walking tour at the National Museum because there is an outdoor escalator that will bring you to the top of Fort Canning...it's located at the left side as you approached the Museum building.

Discovering Fort Canning Park Attractions - covers the Fort Gate, The Battle Box, Fort Canning Historical Sites includes the Keramat - Sultan Iskandar, Spice Garden, Raffles House and Raffles Terrace. A unique view of Singapore from Raffles Terrace - a grand view of downtown Singapore, the Marina Bay Sands Resort, the banking district buildings...Sir Stamford Raffles probably enjoyed the view so much in the British Colonial Days of 1800 that they build a bungalow for him at this hill top!"
,,Historical!,4.0,,"Beautifully kept grounds and gardens to wander through. Good historical plagues set up, but unfortunately the Battle Box was shut on the day we visited. Still - a lovely spot wo wander."
,,Central location,4.0,,"Large park and lots to see in that area. We for example went there after a visit in National Museum. Well maintained, like all parks in Singapore. Nice buildings and some historical sites too, like old grave stones for example"
,,"Peaceful, well kept",4.0,,"This is an excellent park for a walk. If you are visiting Singapore for the first time, go to the Singapore Botanic Garden first. If you have been in Singapore or visiting for a longer stay, this is an excellent place for an evening stroll.
The park is well-kept and there are interesting plants to see. You can walk around the park in a reasonable amount of time. There are other people around, but it is definitely not crowded.
It's simply a wonderful, peaceful place for a nice walk."
,,Park with a history,4.0,,"The many parks in Singapore are all well kept. Canning park add some history to that with some relics from another era. Though there's not so much left from the fort, you still can get an impression. The park lies on a small mountain, and has a fence around the top part. I haven't found out why. An officer told me tere was a reservoir...
Besides this, beautiful trees, one of them with hugh aireal roots hanging downwards, are all around."
,,Nice place for a walk,4.0,,"Enjoyed a lovely couple of hours strolling around, watching the squirrels and enjoying the herb garden. Take plenty water though, there are no shops nearby and when the heat and humidity take their toll, you'll need it. I looked like I'd been thrown in a swimming pool by the end of it. Oh, and it's steep in lots of places."
,,Tranquil,5.0,,A lovely place to have an early morning walk through the park. Lots of locals doing Tai Chi in the park.
,,Easy Access from Orchard Road,4.0,,"Fort Canning park is easily accessible by steps from Orchard Road.
There are convenient steps behind the National Museum.
The Battle Box is worth a visit to get an idea of the last days of British Imperial rule.
Taxi's go to the Battle Box visitors centre if you do want to use the stairs."
,,good place for picnic,4.0,,"It is a quiet park, suitable for picnic and a casual walk. A cooking school is also nearby, where you may drop a visit."
,,The Long Bar at the Raffles Hotel and History of WW11 at the Battle Box,5.0,,"It is obligatory for me, when I come to Singapore, to go to The Raffles for a Singapore Sling in The Long Bar. The Singapore Sling was created by bartender, Ngiam Tong Boon at The Raffles Hotel in 1915. He used fresh lime juice, pineapple juice, Benedictine, Orange Liqueur, Grenadine Syrup, Angostura Bitters, Gin and Cherry Brandy to ""knock your socks off"".

It is an amazing experience, steeped in so much history. From there I make my way to Fort Canning Park. I've been to Fort Canning Park on four separate visits to Singapore. I toured the Battle Box each time as I found the history of this place fascinating. There are 26 rooms in The Battle Box which re-enacts the final days of the takeover of Singapore. The Battle Box has specially crafted wax figures, some of which can move and talk using animatronics. I found the re-creation scenes extremely emotional and you can get a sense of what it must have been like for the soldiers who served there. Apparently the Battle Box is closed for renovation but if you get the chance when you go to Singapore and it is open, you must go to the Battle Box to experience this fantastic exhibit.

Fort Canning Park is well maintained and Fort Canning Centre shows life in another era. Gattopardo Italian Grill & Pizza Bar serves fine food and on another occasion, the Indian Restaurant located at the rear of the Old Married Soldier's Quarters served exceptional food at cheap prices."
,,Big humidity but amazing,4.0,,"Humidity was very high, you will be sweaty in one minute, but it is amazing. In the middle of the city, a real beautiful park was preserved, where you can find several nice trees, flowers, birds and some excavations also. You have to spend approx one hour here, worth of it."
,,One of Singapore's secrets- near the National Museum; accessible from Dhoby Ghaut MRT station,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a peaceful area- ideal for a stroll as part of a day trip.

It's near to other attractions: principally the National a Museum of Singapore, which is an excellent place to visit, with two good places to eat.

There is signage within the Park to guide you to places of interest. Also, there is a hotel within the Park area.

I found it particularly interesting on this visit to look at a wall of burial sites- part of the interesting history of Singapore.

I suggest that if you are visiting attractions in the area, you make the additional time to take a walk through the Park."
,,"Dilapidated buildings, nice flora though",3.0,,"When you visit this place, you can expect to see some old fort gates, Raffles' House, Old Married Soldiers' Quarters and the Fort Canning Centre - an old barrack of the British Army in Singapore, all very run-down. They are for special events on bookings. Visitors or members of the public can visit any time though, take a look inside these buildings, they are empty. If the place is filled with people some events must be on-going, e.g. weddings (due to the registry of marriages next door). The place is also popular with students (from a nearby university) and people going there for picnics. Before visit, download a map of the park, plan at least 1 hour strolling through the park. Park is open 24 hours, but night time strolling is not recommended, pathways are very dark and dangerous. Other attractions include the archaeological dig exhibitions, Spice Garden, Cupolas, Battle Box, 2 9-pound cannons, a replica lighthouse, ASEAN Sculpture Garden and a Sally Port."
,,Close to the city,3.0,,"Visited the Park after a morning in the National Musuem, it is a sea of calm. I was hoping to visit the Battle Box but it was closed and apparantly has been for quite a while. There is quite a bit of work ongoing hopefully completed soon. It is an enjoyable walk through the park and it does take you down to Clarke Quay."
,,disappointing,2.0,,After walking from the local MRT station I was disappointed to find that the battle box is closed indefinitely and that there isn't really much else to do there. I wandered around the grounds for a little while in an aimless fashion eventually finding my way out! On the plus side it is next to the national museum which is definitely worth a visit and there are some nice photo opportunities if you are that way inclined!!!
,,"Beautiful place but full of construction, with poor info about how to avoid it.",3.0,,"Poor info generally in the park, as well as a lack of food and drink. Battle Box closed too with little info provided. Fort Canning Centre is grubby, with poor lighting and expensive exhibits. Spice garden is nice though."
,,Lovely green way to get from hotel to Orchard Rd shopping.,4.0,,Pretty walk through historic location Respite from heat and bustle of busy city. Read about the history of the city. Beautiful trees and well kept grass with seating to enjoy the cool breeze.
,,Stunning Grounds,5.0,,I had a wonderful time wondering through Fort Canning Park. There is a lot of history to read about and a few artifacts to see. The gardens are superbly maintained and some of the trees have to be at least 150 years old. A great photography playground. I came across a local in the Spice Garden who happily shared his knowledge about the many herbs and spices used in traditional cooking. It's close to the centre of town so very easy access.
,,Ballet on the grass,4.0,,We went for a performance on a Saturday evening with a picnic hamper and had a delightful time.The performance itself was outstanding and was further enhanced by the setting and the freedom to lounge on the grassy slopes partaking of some delicious fruit and snacks.
,,Lack of up to date information on website,2.0,,After checking website was very disappointed to commute to Fort Canning to find the venue closed and especially a note at the Battle Box door advising that it would be CLOSED INDEFINITELY.
,,Runners' and Walkers' paradise,3.0,,"Approaching Fort Canning Park from the marina area you will see a very odd site - a lighthouse buried in green foliage and creepers. It used to be the 'welcome' place for foreigners entering Singapore hence I guess the lighthouse. Fort Canning is just south off Orchard Road. It's literally a high point of a trip to Singapore. More hustle and bustle than the Singapore Botanical gardens but impressive because of its height and historical significance.
If you need a workout this is the place for a run or a brisk walk. Up hill and down dale.
If you are fighting the shopaholics then you might be able to drag them into Fort Canning Park as its so close to Orchard Road shops - you can see the shops, I'm sure from the park. Casual walking and site-seeing abound.
There's also a hotel in the park. Worth a look around and maybe it's a place to stay next time, being part of an oasis in shoppers heaven. There are two pools that seem little used so take the plunge."
,,Very Nice Park,4.0,,This oasis in the middle of Singapore near both Orchard Rd. and the CDB is worth a stroll if you want to surround yourself with some green space for a while. There is also a very well done WWI museum in the park that recounts the war as it affected Singapore. There are several paths in the park and it would be worth spending an hour our so if you want to escape the urban scenery for a little while.
,,A park and a historical site in one,4.0,,"I took a quick early evening run from YMCA to Fort Canning and ended up staying for hours.

Fort Canning, located at a hill which used to house defenses for the 'old' Singapura is a free park and historical site in one. It's a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of commercial Singapore and you could spend hours jogging and enjoying the flowers, trees and birds.

The views of the city from Fort Canning are spectacular. There are historical markers which offer visitors a glimpse of Singapore's past.

I particularly enjoyed the old cemetery with the lovely open area used for performances.

Highly recommended!"
,,A pleasant walk with glimpses into Singapore's history,4.0,,"There are several entrances to this Park - I took the escalator next to the National Museum. I then followed the signs through the Spice Garden and the archaeological dig to the Fort Canning Centre - not much was happening here (it would be a nice location for a coffee shop) but I was able to pick up a map of the Park which assisted my exploration of the area and my understanding of what I was seeing.
The map suggests three self guided walks - heritage trees, Singapore's Ancient History and Singapore's's Colonial History. By circling the top of the hill and descending via Raffles House, the Flagstaff, the Lighthouse and the Mural Wall, I saw most of the sights. From Raffles Terrace there is a great view towards the Marina Bay area. I was disappointed that the Battle Box was closed (indefinitely and without explanation, if I remember correctly). I stopped for a morning coffee at the Glass House Cafe in Hotel Fort Canning."
,,Besides a walk down memory lane...there is nothing much here.,3.0,,"Good: -This place is part of Singapore's colonial history, which Sir Stamford Raffles did as part of his city planning. -Many famous people have their graves, scattered around the premise. -Still in its original condition. Bad: -Mosquitos are present. -No eateries. -Hot weather."
,,Fort Canning Park,4.0,,Fort Canning Park is the oldest park in the heart of the city. Some early artifacts like porcelain bowls have been discovered here and they date back to the 18th century. FCP is an ideal park and is the favourite haunt of young lovers who...More
,,Place for a leisure stroll,4.0,,"The fort, as such does not have anything to offer. The place around the fort is good for a leisure walk in the evening. And you can continue the walk and end at Clarke Quay to unwind in the night"
,,battlebox closed for renovations,2.0,,went here for last few hours before leaving for the airport with the main purpose to look around the battlebox museum. finally found it with a notice on the door saying closed for renovations. our concierge had looked up the website the night before to...More
,,Beautiful park for a romantic walk,4.0,,It is very peaceful and beautiful. You forget that it is located in the middle of a huge city. Nice for a romantic pick nick!
,,Historical!,4.0,,"What a beautiful preservation of whatever that is left of Singapore. Thank you Mr Government! Take a stroll, enjoy the quiet beauty or sign up for the battlebox tour. When you are tired, head down to the hotel for tea!"
,,A visit to Fort Canning Park,4.0,,"Visited Fort Canning Park last week. Unfortunately the WW 2, command bunkers was closed for maintenance works. Nevertheless, the historical feel of the park remains untouched like the old lighthouse, Fortress gateway, King's tomb and old grave stone memorial wall. These sites are well inscripted...More"
,,A great historical park,4.0,,"Evaluated as a park alone, Fort Canning definitely can't beat some of the other beautiful green spaces in Singapore like the Botanical Gardens. The true value of Fort Canning is its historical significance. To get the most out of your visit, I recommend taking one...More"
,,Take a guided tour,4.0,,"I agree with a recent review that it will be extremely useful to take a Saturday guided tour to learn about the fauna (e.g. ginger plants, herbs, palms ...) or a historic tour provided free of charge by volunteers under a National Parks programme (check...More"
,,Tranquility in the city,4.0,,We were walking from Chinatown to Orchard Road today and passed through Fort Canning Park. What a pleasant oasis of tranquility in the city: a great place to escape and relax for a bit. We were there at circa 3pm and the park was virtually...More
,,On the way to Clark Quay!,4.0,,This is the closest quiet oasis to Clark Quay so good to cross the road for a little bit of peace and quiet.
,,Waste of time,1.0,,"I made the trip out to Fort Canning to visit the Battle Box....Upon arriving there was a note on the entrance saying ""closed until further notice"" Well done Fort Canning you could have put this on your website!! NOT EVEN SORRY ON YOUR NOTICE!!"
,,Beautiful park,5.0,,"For those who love nature, history and some peace, this is a place that you should go. Fort Canning park possesses many cultural and historical values besides a beautiful nature. A scent in the park that was so light and pure made me feel so refresh and calm. Even when I'm writing these words I can recall that experience"
,,average,3.0,,"The fort Canning park has alot of history to it but, I didn't find it that great. The park is a good place to walk around and its huge."
,,Full of emptiness,3.0,,"Expectations were high as we approached Fort Canning. They dropped as we found the park deserted, the Battle Box closed INDEFINITELY and a noisy ""Bloc Party"" band setting up.
There was a lot of potential there but I think either enthusiasm has waned or money is lacking.
It is a pity because it is full of history and the grounds are beautifully kept. The views are wonderful, there are birds and plants and an air of tranquility. Worth a peek to see the sights, but not a place I would return to unless the Battle Box is re-opened."
,,Time your visit with a free guided walk to enhance the experience,4.0,,"I went with my partner to Fort Canning and attended a free heritage guided walk on a Saturday morning and found it a highly informative and enjoyable way to work up an appetite for brunch!

There's actually many hidden treasures around Fort Canning including remnants of a cemetary, a archaelogical dig, a spice garden and a fort gate. I don't think the Fort Canning experience would have been the same without a guided tour which is why other reviewers have found it disappointing.

The National Parks Board appears to run free guided tours from 4 - 5.30pm on Saturdays <http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/images/stories/guided-walks.html>. My tip is to bring mosquito repellant and wear long pants as I was nearly eaten alive at the dig!

,,Quiet oasis and very historic,4.0,,"We spent a quiet afternoon exploring this area. At time of writing the Battle Box was still closed. Aside from this, the gardens are relaxing. The graves are particularly interesting, dating back to the mid 1800s. Definitely worth a look."
,,dissapointing,3.0,,went up to look at this site to discover that the battlebox was closed. the entire canning centre was empty rooms. only one display and that was of a rikshaw. did see an archelogical dig and some other building which was beingused for a meeting. dont bother unless you want to get away from the traffic.
,,Lovely Park with Historical Features,3.0,,"There is easy parking and a short stroll up the hill to the old fort. The gardens are leafy and shaded by huge, ferny trees. We paid to visit the Battery Box which was the underground HQ of the British and Allied Forces in WWII. It is a moving experience being in the actual rooms and hearing transcripts of the surrender of Singapore in 1942. This small underground museum has been lovingly restored and feels totally authentic. The guided tour was well presented and fascinating. It is air-conditioned now and an interesting and cool refuge on a hot day. We enjoyed our visit, but I wished that there was water available in the vending machines instead of just sugary and fizzy drinks. Also there should be more books available for those who would like to research the fall of Singapore more thoroughly. On the whole is was a pleasant way to while away a hot afternoon."
,,Nice stroll,4.0,,"Nice for a quiet walk, can be slippery in places and sometime steep, easy access from several MRTs and the city. Not much to do here except for the underground bunker."
,,grave on the wall,4.0,,"I never knew that this place was cemetery, and was nice with old grave and big tree. Awesome, nice for taking a photo session."
,,Wonderful Experience,5.0,,The park is Superb and we can say it as Garden. Most of the Trees have the description and maintenance of the Park is very well. I have enjoyed the Park a lot. Park is too large and it is almost connected to 2 MRTs and several main roads. It will take entire day to cover the park completely. Also it is picnic spot. The terraces are very good and you can enjoy well. Free drinking water (thru taps) facility is available in the Park.
,,Fort Canning Park,4.0,,It is very hilly but pretty and quiet. There are nice walking trails which all lead up to the top where the old fort is. I didn't go into anything but the park itself if very nice.
,,Interesting glimpse into history,4.0,,"Not all that easy to find - located behind Fort Canning with the ticket office housed in a tiny white building. The Battle Box is filled with models, maps and recreations of life as it must have been 65 years ago. I enjoyed it - the people who opted for the guided tour looked less enthused. I guess it's the kind if place you may want to explore at your own pace."
,,Battle Box....,4.0,,Fine Park to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Visited the Battle Box which is worth a visit if you are interested in military history .
,,Singapore History,4.0,,"Tucked behind Clarke Quay, Fort Canning has several spots to visit the history of the fall of British held Singapore to the Japanese."
,,Hidden Gem,4.0,,"We happened across the park as we were walking through the city, and we are so glad we found it. Beautiful park, with some nice walking paths that are excellently maintained as well."
,,Historical journey to the past,5.0,,The place has a really peaceful atmosphere. The dugout was cool too. Very educational and suitable for all ages.
,,beautiful park right next to clarke quay,4.0,,"while the walk is a little up hill, it gives a magificanet view over the singapore river and the city. pleasant in the evenings and really worth a look."
,,Serene Oasis in the middle of the city,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park has a great atmosphere for picnic, watching concert and hold a wedding. You can also go for a walk with your loved ones or go jogging."
,,Great War Museum,4.0,,The animatronics at this museum are great and give you a real feel for the final days before the Japanese invasion on Singapore. Beautiful park like setting and the restaurant on site is one not to be missed.
,,Peaceful and interesting,5.0,,"We stumbled across Fort Canning Park one morning when going for a walk. The kids loved exploring all the walkways and there were plenty of photo opportunities. The gardens are lush and the park has a very peaceful quality. The history of the place is intriguing for the adults and the huge gate is fascinating for little boys! The Battlebox is also a place of huge interest.

There are a LOT of stairs so it isn't suitable for prams, the elderly or young children who want to be carried a lot.

Although this was an unplanned part of our visit it was one of the most enjoyable mornings we had. Just do it early in the day before the heat sets in."
,,The Battle Box,4.0,,We spend half a day there walking to climb the hill and looking around. Spend several hours inside the tunnels dug out before WW11. This was where the decision to surrender to Japanese was made.
,,Shakespeare in the Garden,4.0,,"Check out, if there is a festival or concert. Very nice place to spend some time and walk around in the garden."
,,Interesting escape from the city,4.0,,"This is easy to get to and right in the city. The traffic noise can still be heard but it is at a distance and the green, leafy spaces are a welcome relief. There are interesting things to see - old gravestones from sailors and early settlers of Singapore, archaeological finds, the old gate of the fort, a spice garden and Raffles' bungalow among others. The best part was the Battle Box, which charges a small fee. You won't find any refreshments unless you want to pay large amounts for them at the Fort Canning Hotel, but it would be a lovely place for a picnic as there are plenty of places to sit. There weren't crowds of people there, either."
,,great place to see a concert,3.0,,"in general, i give an average rating - i enjoy running around the park, but it's not extraordinary, however, seeing a concert here is fantastic! eclx"
,,Fort Canning Park,4.0,,Found Fort Canning Park a short walk from Robertson Walk. The park can be accessed by car or bus. Very well maintained and full of history of Singapore
,,A nice morning walk,4.0,,"The Park was a 5 minute stroll from our Hotel, although it took a little longer to walk up all the steps from the road! It was a lovely way to spend a couple of hours walking around."
,,A gorgeous park.,4.0,,"This is a wonderful park to enjoy a 2-hour stroll.
While the entrance to the park starts with many, many, MANY stairs, it is well worth to get to the upper part of the park, where you can enjoy beautiful jungle-like trees, lovely flowers and even some historic buildings.
The view from the park is lovely and the trees contrast beautifully with the tall buildings surrounding the park.
You can take a circular path around the water reservoir. Just make sure not to get too close to the fence of the water reservoir. As the sign suggests - those guys are SERIOUS!
Despite visiting the park in the late morning/early noon on a hot July day, the stroll in the park was rather effortless most of the time and is suitable for everyone (as long as you can handle the numerous stairs on the entrance).
Highly recommended!"
,,Pleasant park gets an extra star mainly for the Battle Box,4.0,,"It's a pleasant walk through the grounds of this park on a hill, but what remains of the fort is quite limited if well-illustrated on the two trails around the park.

Highlight is really the Battle Box: a guided tour takes you through re-enactments of the one-sided Japanese invasion and the subsequent sad British surrender undertaken to avoid an even worse bloodbath."
,,Picnicking Haven,5.0,,"Wonderful environment with lots of special herbal plants and trees!
But the best thing about this place is the clean and even grass land in front of the stage where you may have casual picnics or enjoy outdoor performances with prepared feasts when coming with friends and family."
,,Great place to go for a walk,4.0,,"It only takes about an hour to walk to entire trail, but there's always something interesting happening at the park. Really like to come on the weekend and mellow for a while."
,,Peaceful...until the night of the rock concerts,4.0,,"I attended school near Fort Canning Park over 25 years ago and till today, still know it as a peaceful respite from the bustle of Bras Basah and Orchard Roads. With some funerary architecture dating back to the 1800s and an ongoing archeological dig still going on at certain times of the year, it's steeped in local historical importance. The presence of the National Museum of Singapore at the foot of Fort Canning hill also lends a certain degree of culture and sophistication to the surroundings.

These days, modernisation is leaning in and the park plays the role of concert venue under the stars. Ranging from classical to rock, as well as plays and shows, it's a terrific place for the concert goer as well as the family."
,,Lovely Historical Park,4.0,,"Lush and tropical the old fort still has relics like the battle box, cannon, as well as lovely tress and flora. You can easily stroll around the park and it was quite relaxing. Bring your walking shoes. It is off the beaten track so you tend to walk there and back as less linking transport."
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"A lovely oasis of calm in the heart of the city, just behind Clarke Quay. Some interesting historical insights into early Singapore.
Would have given it a higher score oif the Battle Box had been open at 11:45 when oit was supposed to be , instead of closed for lunch 15 mins early"
,,Hidden treasure,4.0,,"Hidden behind the National Museum - great place to visit for all. There is a spice garden for those interested in plants. Don't forget to look for the ""Cannonball Tree"" in the main courtyard near the remnants of the Fort Gate. There is an archaeological dig site as well as the last Malay King's tomb. Kids will enjoy the cannon, the Fort Gate (you can climb up) as well as a Sally Port to sneak out.

There are several art installations around as well weddings on the weekends."
,,Wonderful evening under the stars,5.0,,"My husband and I have attended two events at Fort Canning Park - the ballet under the stars and also a Shakespearean play. Both were wonderful. The park opens up a couple hours before the events start, and people throw blankets down on the grass, bring food and drinks and essentially have a picnic before and during the shows. Both times we've had a wonderful time. One word of caution, however. Make sure you have transport arranged back to your hotel. Getting a taxi from there is quite tricky if you aren't from Singapore. You end up having to walk a ways to find an actual taxi stand, and it can be a little confusing."
,,"2 Historical Trails - Ancient Singapore Trail, Or Colonial Singapore Trail",3.0,,"Fort Canning Park & Battle Box is one of Singapore's oldest parks, and also one of the earliest seats of government during the colonial days. The Battle Box is actually a museum located within Fort Canning Park. Getting around is relatively easy, however, there are 2 different trails you could take to explore the place.

The more popular trail is the Colonial Singapore Trail, as you'll get to see most of the remaining artifacts and architecture within Fort Canning Park & Battle Box. This trail features highlights like 2 9 Pound Cannons, the Gothic Gates, the Light House, Time Ball, Fort Gate, Sally Port, and of course, the Battle Box museum.

In contrast, the Fort Canning Park & Battle Box trail called the Ancient Singapore Trail features more storyboards rather than exhibits. The highlights here include the Keramat and Mural Walls.

Because of these 2 different trails, exploring Fort Canning Park & Battle Box over 2 short visits, rather than 1 long visit, is an option. Furthermore, exploring the Battle Box museum will take some time as well.

Located at Cox Terrace in Fort Canning Park, the Battle Box museum is a restored underground bunker. Though small, they've managed to fill the place quite well with various exhibits, and it is well worth a look.

If you're planning a visit, do note that while Fort Canning Park is free, the admission to Battle Box costs $5. Allocate between 1 to 4 hours for viewing, and bring water along."
,,Great 1/2 day,5.0,,A nice quiet place to spend a few hours. The relics there and history make for an interesting visit. The gardens are well laid out and very pretty.
,,Unusual,4.0,,It was an unusual setting for a wedding dinner. The dinner was set under a huge tent. However we enjoyed the dinner and the service.
,,The silence is deafening walking in Fort Canning Park,5.0,,"Fort Canning Park
Fort Canning Park is actually a cultural as well a heritage master piece. You will be led past the most historic part of Singapore. Malay and Chinese historical records point to this hill as the centre of a kingdom that arose around 1300 AD. You‚Äôll see The Keramat Iskandar Syah, which means a sacred place in Malay, ‚ÄúKeremat‚Äù is a tradiotional burial ground. You‚Äôll see an Archaeological Excavation site, the ‚ÄúParit Singapora‚Äù, ancient Malay and Chinese sources mention that Singapore had a ‚Äúmoat and wall‚Äù. The western wall shows you breath-taking views of the ‚ÄúSingapore River. Last but not least you‚Äôll walk to the ‚ÄúReservoir‚Äù, a natural spring site which fed the ‚ÄúPancur Larangan‚Äù a bathing place reserved for 14th century Malay royalty. The breath-taking old trees, adorned with majestic ferns is something together with the silence makes this walk very special. You need to come the next day though, because Fort Canning Park has another very special treasure, The Battle Box. An absolutely stunningly restored takes you right into the British H.Q Malaysia Command. Take your time for both. Both ‚Äúattractions‚Äù are suitable for seniors. For The Battle Box children need to be a bit older then the age of 6."
,,Relaxing Walk and Reading Place,4.0,,"The place is serene and perfect ambiance for picnic mat and good book. However, I went on Sunday and though its NOT that crowded, there are few people who could potentially disturb you by their actions. Like couples who are very intimate etc. Since it is Sunday, its off day for most household workers so they add to the park's visitor population. I think Saturday morning or late afternoon is the best time to unwind. I'll definitely try it again on another day."
,,Great way to people watch the locals,4.0,,"I enjoyed the park and walking around, learning about the history and seeing the cannons, although l think my favourite part was people watching the locals. As the population is quite large for a small place this park appears to be a romantic destination for couples and families.
The nature was great alongside weddings and family events."
,,Modern sculpture,4.0,,"That might not be what you expect in this green oasis, testament to the colonial heritage. Personally, I am not a great sculpture devotee but I was impressed. It really is possible to see, I think, what the artist was intending with some of these works. If you are attending a conference at Hotel Fort Canning, as I was, it is essential to make time to view the park as it really is on the "" doorstep""."
,,Nature and Fresh Air,4.0,,"It is right opposite to YWCA Fort Canning Lodge. We liked the variety of trees, walk amidst spice garden, heritage walk intermixed with he history related to WW-II in form of Battle Box also located in the same area.
Excellent place to recharge the energy after exhaustive shopping trips."
,,beautiful park in the city,4.0,,"one I like about Singapore beside the cleaneliness, there are so many beautifull parks inside the city. Fort canning hill one of the parks. We through the park from National Museum to go the Clarke Quay. very nice walking tour inside the park."
,,Fort Channing ‚Äì Battle Box great,5.0,,"A must see the battle box, it is located near the Fort Channing Hotel very well laid out and interesting,
We walked from The Park Hotel Clarke Quay and started at north end the battle box here after walked through the park and saw more of the highlights. There is lots of shade. We at end went to China Town. There is MRT located at South end."
,,A great late afternoon walk through Singapore's colonial history,4.0,,"The location, the explanatory signboards, the greenery, landscape and history combined. Raffles' bungalow, the lighthouse and modern SIngapore views. Spend an hour or so there late afternoon and then head down to Boat Quay for a drink and a bite to eat!"
,,A nice stroll,4.0,,It's a nice change from the city scene. A bit of history and pretty surroundings. Many outdoor concerts are held here. There is a beautiful view from the government house building.
,,Beautiful tropical oasis,5.0,,"A beautiful tropical oasis in the center of Singapore. Many magnificent trees and peaceful grassed areas. Also contains the Battle Box, a fascinating museum made from the British war-time command bunker, reminiscent of the Cabinet War rooms in London and one of the best-kept secrets of Singapore."
,,Great green escape in the city,4.0,,"Close from Orchard's shopping rows, and it provides a soothing spot for you to relax or do light exercises. The change from seeing buildings to seeing all green is ecstatic!"
,,Beautiful gardens,4.0,,The day we visited it was absolutely bucketing down. We kept going up the paths which were well sign posted to the Fort Canning Museum. The gardens are impressive with plants labelled and very well cared for. Tis a little hilly and with lots of steps to climb proved a challenge with all the water tumbling down. The Museum itself was impressive but suggest a visit when there is a tour guide to give more information.
,,Break away from city,5.0,,"Fort Canning is a huge park, by Singapore's standards. Weddings, photoshoots, and music concerts are held frequently in Fort Canning because of the scenic greenery and nice architecture. There are some stairs and slopes so wear comfortable attire and footwear is smart choice. Right beside the park is the Singapore National Museum, which is a great place to visit as well. Fort Canning Park is also next to the bustling town area of shopping malls, which makes it an amazing getaway from the busy city."
,,A greatly underestimated park,4.0,,"This is a great place to go for a walk or run right in the heart of the city. If you are feeling like some rather cliched 'eductainment', visit the Battle Box which is in the park. Otherwise, learn about the history & culture of the area for free (there is a small archaeological site, a keramat & spice walk). Go in the early evening."
,,Forest in the City,4.0,,"Fort Canning is definitely one of my favourite places in Singapore. The park complex is very versatile - has sculptures, a ""fort"", spices, and various beautiful plants. The greenery is lush, and makes for a wonderful walk."
,,great learning about Singapore history,5.0,,"great surrounding and interesting history, what else ?"
,,Beautiful park steeped in history,4.0,,A lovely park with beautiful views. A perfect spot to retreat from the bustle of city life. Worth stopping in at the Battle Box for a short but informative tour of the history of Singapore during World War 2.
,,Amazing little walk,4.0,,I stumbled across the park on a morning walk and it was beautiful. A very well kept place (like everything in Singapore) and some great historical information explaining how the park had been used in the past including the lighthouse which was once visible from the water but is now blocked by the many buildings. Very interesting and worth a walk through.
,,Good for a gentle stroll,4.0,,"We were staying at the Somerset Liang Court (serviced apartments) across the road and so it was easy to hop across on the pedestrian bridge. Pleasant surprise - good for an hour or so's gentle stroll if you need a break from eating and shopping! Historical bits and pieces, well-marked and signposted. Good low-key enjoyment - not for the adrenalin junkie!"
,,Running at Fort Channing Park,5.0,,"We stayed very close to Fort Channing Park and as a runner it was a great choice. The shaded tracks at the park made for very pleasant running, elevated above the streets of Singapore so away from car fumes and benefiting from views across Singapore. I didn't measure it but the main path circling close to the perimeter of the park but it is about 1.5 to 2.0 km long, and includes some steps and up and down grades. If you leave the Park at the bungee attraction (which is just across the road, down the steps from the hotel in the park), you can join the developed path along the river where you can run uninterrupted (to the left) down to the Marina Bay Area which also has a continuous path around it, then back along the river to explore Clarke Quay. Good stuff but try to do it before breakfast or before a late dinner, due to the heat!"
,,an interesting and worthwhile tour,4.0,,"If you've been to the War Rooms in London, and liked that, you'll also like the tour at Fort Canning. A very interesting and fairly objective view of the history of the defense of Singapore and of its surrender to the Japanese in World War II."
,,Nothing much to do,2.0,,"Besides from looking at gravestones, there's nothing much to see or do at the park. Come here when there are performances"
,,Green quiet amidst the busy city,4.0,,Quiet and peaceful garden on a hill amidst the hustle and bustle of Singapore City
,,History and greenery well-mixed,4.0,,"Steeped in history, this makes a quiet leafy getaway in the middle of the city. Can get a bit eerie with the quiet, especially on weekdays."
,,Good for photo-shoots but that's it.,2.0,,The refurbished Fort Canning still has that colonial feel and the Park is a favourite for wedding photo-shoots. Ok if you are a photography buff but not much else for me.
,,Nice Park in the Center of Singapore,4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is a nice green quiet area between Orchard Road and Clark Quay. There are some interesting historical land marks such as Raffles former bungalow and for history buffs, the battle box sre points of interest. This is where the decision was made by the British to surrender to the invading Imperial Japanese army. The park also features some spice gardens on the side towards the ministry of marriage. The park is free, but the battle box has a small fee."
,,A good run in central Singapore,4.0,,"Fort Canning is a good place for many things. I go there three times a week to run, but there are historical buiildings, gardens, wonderful trees, sometimes markets and sometimes outdoor concerts to experience here."
,,Lovely park in a central location,5.0,,"A great place, cool and quiet and very beautiful trees and plants. Nice walking paths and much history of area to be viewed."
,,Fascinating history of WW2,5.0,,Beautiful park in the middle of the city. Great escape from the heat and the hustle and bustle of the city. You have to take the tour of the Battle Box. You go into the bunkers down below and learn about the surrender of the British to the Japaneese in WW2. Really well done. They have wax figurines of all the major military players...really lifelike and kinda creepy! Check it out.
,,Lovely park in the middle of Singapore,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is a rather built up zone, with a river running through the middle, so it's surprising that only one road away you can be in a leafy park, full of shaded walks under the trees.

I came here very early in the morning for a run; there's some steep (and rather slippery) steps that take you to the top of the hill (not a big hill by any measure, but big enough for Singapore) and then a series of paths that follow the contours of the hill and allow you to gently spiral upwards. Then you can run back down the hill again. Thus it's good for joggers.

It's probably not good for the unsteady of foot, or those trying to propel a small child in a buggy, because of the steep and slimy steps. Although I suppose you could get a taxi to near the top and then walk around - which would be slightly more expensive, but still a pleasant way to find an oasis from all the concrete of central Singapore."
,,Slippery steps,4.0,,"Make sure you wear good shoes , the steps are so slippery if they have any water on them. The gardens are so beautiful, perfect spot to take some time out from the city."
,,Cool place,4.0,,Awesome if you go for a walk. Tough to believe that in teh heart of the concrete jungle you could find something like this.
,,The exiting history about the British Army surrender to Japan during World War 2,5.0,,"Visiting the Underground Far East Command Center for the British Army The Battle Box, and walk 9 m under the the ground in Fort Canning, is very exiting, and gives the visitors a lot to think about, when comming back to the ground again.

You see and hear the British Generals discoussing around the table, if and when they have to surrender to the Japanese during the worst situation for the British Army in Worls War 2. in Asia.

Fort Canning was the hearquarter of its defence bases in 1920 to protect British interrest in South East Asia, and the visitors feel the atmosphere during the tour 9 m. below the earth and see the big table build with landscape for Singapore surroundings, where the British Generals could make there plan for defence of there interrest in Asia.

This tour can be recomended for all visitors who want to know more about the background and history of Singapore."
,,Shady walk thru History,5.0,,It is hard to get a room in the lodge on the grounds but is is worth the wait!
,,Hideaway park right in the middle of the city,5.0,,"There are lots of history on top of this little hill, it was once known as the Forbidden Hill. There is the old fortress Gate, the site where Raffles house was suppose to have been there. World War 11 battle box is here. Lots to see and do here"
,,Old buildings and great surrounds,4.0,,"Many archeological digs at this place. Apparently the history stretches back to pre-Raffles Singapore. Apart from the history, a very nice park to visit and right in the middle of the business district."
,,Great walking trail at dawn,3.0,,"Place is just right behind the National Museum. The usual park with lots of grass and trees but offers a different ambiance. Nothing much to see but if you wanna be one with nature, then this is the place to be."
,,Nothing much,3.0,,Just a park in the middle of the cbd. Nothing much...
,,Old Governor House,4.0,,Personally I'd prefer the old rustic version before the renovation. But the National Parks Board did a very good job at restoring parts of the place. The old WWII tunnels are great history tellers if you are travelling there with the young ones. Roam around there in the middle of the night and you may get a chance to say hi to some of the war veterens too. :D
,,A quaint place to find out about World War II,4.0,,Fort Canning Park is a quiet place for tourists to take a stroll or read a book in. There are also monuments around the park in commemoration of World War II for tourists who are history buffs.
,,Lovely experience all round,5.0,,"The park is close to major hotels and we walked there in early morning and it was so nice. The historical value is excellent, the Bunker is so well presented and very informative. I thought I new a bit about Singapore in WW2 but after this visit i have more info to research. The children where so interested and could find something to look at and read around every corner.

The gardens and walks are well worth the visit, it is so well organised and very well kept it makes for a great half day or couple of hours.

There is a visitor centre but it was closed the day we went (new year holiday)."
,,Visit the bunker!,5.0,,"Ths review is really about the bunker - the park itself seemed nothing special to us! However, the bunker tour is good fun and appealed to all our group whose ages ranged from 20 - 50. Very interesting and worth a visit!"
,,History around every corner,4.0,,Takes you back 50 years in time to Gen Perceival and his defence of Singapore
,,park in the city,4.0,,Some great views and a nice place to relax in the city.
,,Beautiful and quiet,5.0,,"Beautiful forest, very nice view. A fresh oasis in the city."
,,Nice walking and views,4.0,,"Great to have a park like this in the middle of the city. I went a couple of times to have a look at its wildlife and plants (shrikes, fly over eagles, lizards etc) but it was a really nice little get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Some interesting history here too."
,,A must see,4.0,,Fort Canning Park in Sigapore has much more than its greenery. It has histoircal significance because of the buildings inside the park and World War II era under ground bunker which was the command centre of British Forces during the war. The bunker named ' Battle Box' is a must see attraction for those who have interest in the history. The war time era is recreated inside the bunker with some interesting wax statues of army generals in command and background voice overs. Very interesting indeed
,,A nice break from the pace,4.0,,"The park provides a very peaceful break once you get the point where you just can't do any more shopping. Like much of Singapore it is laced with historic buildings and artifacts. Particularly interesting is the cemetery wall, with inscriptions back to the early 1800's.

However, you'll need to take your time on the park, as it is on the one decent hill in the CBD area, and you really notice the humidity when the heart rate rises."
,,The Fort Canning Experience,5.0,,"Fort Canning is a lovely park and historic site. A great memorial to the surrender of Singapore during World War II, and those who fought to save Singapore. This is a Lush and beautiful walk through history. Be sure to include the Battle Box on your vist."
,,Ok park,2.0,,"I'm not sure what to look out for in this park. It has some quiet spots, and some weekends you can spot couples having wedding shoots at the park."
,,Nice historic park in the big city,5.0,,"Nice green spot with historical significance right on town.

Interesting history attached to the area all the way from a sacred spot for early natives all the way through a British colonial govt enclave to military usage. And now a beautiful park.

Take time to walk and explore."
,,Reminds me of Avatar,4.0,,Some of the trees up in this park may have been the inspiration for the world they called Avatar in the movie. They are a world of their own with possibly hundreds of plant species surviving together on or within the one tree. The views are also quite lovely.
,,Great walks!,4.0,,"Lovely big park with wonderful plants & trees , all very well maintained, people out jogging, walking their dogs & even doing tai chi & yoga! Has a great view of the city and also often has big music concerts and events going on."
,,Lush fauna but I worked up a sweat,5.0,,"Fort Canning Park was opposite my hotel so I went for an explore in the park. As has been mentioned by another reviewer, it seemed to be very up and down without much flat in between! It was hot and humid, but I paced myself and enjoyed a walk around the park. Good paths with nice markings, the park has plenty to see and enjoy. Definitely an interesting place to visit - just make sure you take a bottle of water!"
,,Quiet place with lot of greenery,3.0,,We reached their in the afternoon so was kind of hot at that time and not many people in the park. The place has some old military history remains. Overall place was quite deserted and not worth the visit considering other attractions available in Singapore.
,,Nice place,3.0,,"Visited Fort Canning from Clarke Quay. From Raffles Terrace, we got a good view of the River and Clarke Quay and can even see the Marina Bay Sands.
With all the trees and foliage, it was not so hot and we had a really pleasant walk."
,,Good very early morning jogging,3.0,,"There is no play ground for children It is either uphill or downhill, no even way."
,,Recommended first stop in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a really good starting point for a visit to Singapore. You get to experience a good sample of the beautiful landscapes, fascinating history and impressive architecture all in one place. I just wandered there on my first day whilst walking to Little India and am so glad that it was my frist stop. It set me up nicely for what has been an overwhelmingly impressive couple of days in Singapore."
,,A nice walking experience,5.0,,We were surprised at how much there was to see at the park. Not anything particularly exciting but the kids enjoyed running around and we stopped to read and observe some historical bits.
,,"Singapore's Heritage, Culture & History surrounded by Nature",5.0,,"This is a tour you can easily undertake without a guide, at your own pace & no cost involved! Fort Canning Park covers 18 hectares and is one of the most beautifully maintained parks we have ever had the pleasure to explore - a veritable oasis & haven set amidst the rush of modern day living in a large city.

From the moment you set foot in the park, a sense of peace & euphoria settles around you. Wending your way through paved walkways, under the sheltering branches of gigantic fig & cotton woods which are strewn with treeferns, it is easy to transport yourself back in time .

The park is well signposted and it would be almost impossible to lose yourself in this vast expanse! There are so many locations of interest to visit such as Raffles Terrace, the Keramat Iskander Syah, the archaeoloical excavation site, Fort Canning Centre, the Fort gate, the Battle Box, Spice Garden - history, culture, heritage - this place has it all.

Pack a lunch and take it with you, so you can sit back, relax and truly enjoy one of Singapore's greatest treasures - Fort Canning Park."
,,good place to escape the crowds close to Clarke Quay & Marina Bay area,4.0,,"We walked through the park on our first day and found it an excellent place to orientate ourselves before throwing ourselves fully into the city hubbub. We walked down to river where and on through the esplanade to the marina which gave us a good starting point. The park is pleasant and the Battle Box tour looked good. There is a large concert area , shady tree areas and the Raffles look out point to take in as you walk along"
,,"Pleasant few hours, if slightly hot & humid",4.0,,"Fort Canning Park is probably a good place to visit for a look around if you're wanting to get away from the busy city streets, and can't be bothered going all the way to the (apparently very good - I've not been) botanic gardens or further out to Bukit Timah.

It features several old colonial buildings, the largest of which houses a dance school (which I don't think the public can easily visit as it's on the top floor) and a cooking school (which you CAN visit, for a relatively inexpensive and tasty buffet lunch). There's also a spice garden (with some reasonably well-maintained hollowed out coconuts from which you can smell/try the spices & herbs), Raffle's old bungalow (which is now pretty much empty, but commands a nice view down the High Street), and an archaeological site, which is covered over from the elements and has some interesting displays about pre-colonial Singapore. The Battle Box (see my review of that separately) is also here, along with a few assorted gates, walls (the park, as the name suggests, was originally a colonial fort, some of which remains in some form or other) and a small sculpture garden.

All the main sites and facilities are within a quarter mile or so of each other on the east side of the park; most of the rest of it is just parkland and paths, although there are a couple of other monuments and an outdoor fitness area on the other side.

All in all, it's nothing mind-blowing, but it's well-tended, has frequent maps, good footpaths (some steps leading into the park but much of it is wheelchair accessible), and ample toilet facilities, as well as some nice views of singapore and a few interesting things to see. If it's not too hot (be warned - in the heat & humidity of Singapore, walking around here can get quite sweaty, although there is a lot of shade) it's a nice place to hang around for an hour or two and maybe have a picnic."
,,Close to the National Museum,4.0,,It is a scenic park with a few colonial buildings; small and quiet. There is now a footbridge leading to the National Museum of Singapore. The park is also in the vicinity of the Armenien Church and the museum of Perankan culture.
,,Nice Park - Battle Box Tour is good,4.0,,"The park itself is nice, with some exhibits about historic items inside. For military history buffs the Battle Box tour is worthwhile. Explains the WW2 history well and is quite an interesting structure."
