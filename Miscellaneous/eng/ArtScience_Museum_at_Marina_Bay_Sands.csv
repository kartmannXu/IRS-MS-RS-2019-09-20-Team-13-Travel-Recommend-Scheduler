,,Future World!,4.0,,I only went here for Future World. I enjoyed my time there and I think it was worth it. I wish they can have more exhibits that adults will like as well. I did see a lot of kids enjoy in the museum but also saw a lot of adults looked bored.
,,Rediculous childish museum,1.0,,This is more a fun Park for children and had nothing to do with art nor science. Better safe your money for a cool drink.
,,A Whimsical Whim,5.0,,Decided to visit on a whim while in Singapore. Had a couple of hours before a flight and wanted some cool air con. Was pleasantly surprised how well this place is put together. The exhibits were fantastically entertaining and easy to access. Ordering tix was also a breeze at the self-service stand.
,,Future World exhibit is one of the coolest things I've ever seen,5.0,,"I can only speak about the Future World exhibit, but it was ridiculously cool. There were about ten rooms, and while many of them are mostly catered to children, the intersection of art and technology is still very interesting. The final room cannot be missed - it is one of the coolest things I've experienced."
,,Building is more interesting than the exhibits,3.0,,"The architecture of the ArtScience Museum is stunning. The is seen from the outside and the inside, although you can walk the all the inside floors for free without entering the exhibits. We did the full exhibit tour and there were three open when we were there. The really wasn't any science link to any of them, but the one on balloons did try to add some technical aspects. There were several high-tech video installations, but all the focus was on visuals and not the underlying technology. Our daughters enjoyed the interactive drawing parts and playing with the balls that change color based on how fast they are going, but as other reviewers say, there isn't much of particular interest for adults. The Wonderland exhibit was heavily hyped, but it was mainly a presentation of all the books/movies based on the story so more history than anything else. We all found that interesting, but neither Art nor Science."
,,"Not where Art meets Science, more like Fart meets Patience",3.0,,"The best way to enjoy this iconic building is to admire it from the outside. Compared to government-owned museums (like the National Gallery or Asian Civilisation Museum), this one has the highest price AND the lowest amount of interesting content. The current three exhibitions are enjoyable for young children below 22 years old. Otherwise, they are just collections of low-operating-costs (or even low set-up costs) items. Yet, because of the high appeal to young children, queues can be quite long on weekends. Sometimes, farting can made queuing quite toxic. No wonder Japanese tourists keep their masks on. The 3 stars is an average of 4 stars for families with young children and 2 stars for others."
,,Awesome exhibits,5.0,,"We spent our last day in Singapore at the ArtScience Museum, and we all loved it. We live in Japan, so we are very familiar with TeamLab exhibits, and my kids were thrilled to get the chance to visit a different one. The interactive activities were fun for all of us. They especially loved coloring their pictures and seeing them come to life up on the wall. Aside from a few extra activities, this one was very similar to TeamLab Future Park in Fukuoka.
The Wonderland Exhibit was our favorite. It was so cool how the maps interacted with some displays, and we all enjoyed hunting for our maps story in each room."
,,Not enough to see. Only for children.,1.0,,This place was only there to get a nice Instagram photo and for children. Nothing outstanding there. There was only about 3 rooms too. Rubbish for the price. Save your money.
,,nice place for someone who love art,4.0,,cool and instagramable place to visit even if you not really understand about something related to art and its kids friendly too
,,Excellent exhibits Future of the World and Wonderland,5.0,,"Kids had an amazing time in both the FoW and Wonderland exhibitions. The line to get into the exhibitions are somewhat long, but well worth the wait for the fantastic experience inside. Both exhibitions are interactive and engaging. I can especially envision spending half a day at FoW alone (with kids) if we have had more time.

Would suggest child/ senior friendly arrangements to enhance the experiences of those two groups with special needs. I see a lot of family waiting in line, and kids gets restless after a long wait. Some fall asleep in their parents arms while waiting and had to be carried for hours."
,,An awesome time at “Future World”!!,5.0,,"We went to the Art and Science Museum, expecting to see the ‘Alice’ exhibit, but were told that there was a 30 min wait. They then suggested Future World, which was amazing!! It was really interactive with slides, glowing balls, design your own hopscotch... I can’t even begin!! A bit crowded and expensive but TOTALLY worth it!!!!!!"
,,Alice in Wonderland,5.0,,"First of all in my opinion, an extent of which you would value the show very much depend on what shows are being staged. Luckily, beside The Future World, we also had Alice in Wonderland, during our July visit. The museum has different agenda over time.

My kids claimed that the show has been their highlight during Spore holiday in July 2019.

The colors show, 3D paintings, are mind-boggling. While Alice in Wonderland exhibition took us back in the time of magical journey. Overall, we appreciate governmsnt of Singapore on their endeavor to provide affordable yet entertaining and educative show to the public."
,,Future world x floating utopia,2.0,,"Whenever it comes to contemporary art it would automatically mean an IG spot, but the one hosted by teamlab(future world) turned into a children playground instead. Kids running everywhere, screaming, it’s like a zoo rather than an art museum.
I bought a pass for 2 exhibition, skipping the wonderland one, for SG32, it was not worth it for its display and the atmosphere.
The floating utopia was alright nothing major."
,,Museum to visit in Singapore,4.0,,"If you are into museum and such, you might want to include this one in your itinerary. Currently they have several good exhibition, like Future World, Alice in Wonderland and Floating Utopias.

You might have seen some interesting shots from instagram like people touching a huge moon. That one is from the Floating Utopias installation. Before you come, you need to make sure the time of each exhibition.

Price per person for adult foreigners like us is S$19 for single exhibition. You can get better price for bundling exhibition. 2 exhibition at S$32 and all exhibition at S$40."
,,Does not sufficiently cater for adults,1.0,,"I spent 1.5 hrs here last week and it was very disappointing. I can see how it would be fun for the children however it does not cater for an adult audience. A few token pieces of information and uninspiring displays make me wonder if the adverts where embellished. In one exhibition there was only 5 or so displays.
This was not worth the money as an adult and I would not be recommending this to any one without children soon."
,,Wonderful place for geeks and kids,4.0,,"Collection of various exhibitions. Some are boring, some are fun (the giant inflatable Moon is wonderful). Some are excellent, like the interactive exhibition on the ground floor. Hours of fun for kids and their parents with giant ipads and interactive toys and games. We had a great time."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Tickets are easily purchased online.
I only had time for one exhibit and decided on the Future World ... When Art meets Science.
The high tech interactive exhibits were awesome! If you love taking photos, my advice is to go on a weekday when its less crowded. Highly recommend!"
,,Lots of gimmicks,3.0,,Went to the wonderland exhibition. The museum is big but found most of the content gimmicky esp the last part. My 4-yr old nephews enjoyed themselves though.
,,Well worth it,5.0,,"We had seen this on a YouTube video. Upon arrival we found there were different areas to visit and each had to have their own ticket purchased. We went through the art science part. It’s one of those museums which will create memories which will never be forgotten. Seeing so many people from all ages, all nationalities and religions, just smiling and having fun, interacting with technology, creating art, sounds and games was magical. If you have teens, smaller children or no kids. Just go, and interact, you’ll love it."
,,Well worth the money,5.0,,"The current exhibitions are amazing. Floating Utopias and Wonderland exceeded my expectations. Future world was pretty cool. The lady at the information desk gave a great tip, if we joined the Sands Rewards Lifestyle program we could buy 1 ticket and get a second one free, so instead of paying $40 each per adult for all of the exhibits, we paid only $20 per adult."
,,Unforgetable,5.0,,"I bought e ticket for all access..
My family including 5 yo boy enjoyed every attractions.
Really amazing way to combine art and science.
A bit confused to get there when using bus..but not a big issue..
You just need consider walking distance if you need to walk with small kids"
,,Surprisingly awesome,5.0,,this place is good for kids and many stuff there really nice ambient. you can take a picture but not with flash.
,,"Wish I was told that Future World exhibition is for children, NOT for adults (I DID ask for help at ticketing center)",2.0,,"It was very disappointing to pay almost $40 for my husband and I to get into the exhibition called “Future World” and discover that most of what they have there is evidently for kids - colorouring books, a slide, big colorful inflated balloons/balls to jump on, etc.
I asked a person who works at the ticketing center for advice - whether it is a good choice to specifically get into this exhibition, and she said it was the best option. Clearly she saw we were a couple of adults with no children around us, so I wish she helped me pick a better option for the two of us.
“Crystal universe” installation at the end is beautiful (that’s the picture they have on a poster) but is not even enjoyable to walk through as you have to wait in a queue for a very long time as people in front take their sweet time to snap a million photos. That space should be better organizied and maybe controlled with respect towards all people who’d like to enjoy it. It looks fantastic on photos and promotional videos - but you certainly won’t have that experience when you are there...
When at the exit I asked if they would allow us to see another exhibition (explaining the situation, that I asked for help and was recommended to go to the kids interactive exhibition) all I received was a shoulder shrug and told to go to visitors center and “maybe they will help me, I am not sure” (quoting)."
,,Floating Flop,2.0,,"I can not understand why this is a permanent exhibition at the Artsience Museum unless there were unused space and the owners needed to earn some revenue for it!
The facts on the wall posters were somewhat interesting but the items on exhibition were really bad and uninteresteni. Looked like some oversized blow-up dolls. Only the big balloon that looked like the moon was worth looking at...the rest pretty uninteresting."
,,"Wondrous, not to be missed!",5.0,,"Not to be missed, an amazing experience . We went to the Future World exhibition only, however there are others. It was wondrous, viewers can interact with the projected images. You could also draw & colour in pictures, scan them in and they then would be generated on the wall, becoming part of the projected art. Great for all ages, our 6 year old son had a ball and thought that it was amazing."
,,Highly recommend this museum,4.0,,"Our family of four (two kids aged 8 & 10) recently visited the museum and experienced the Future Worlds exhibition and also the Wonderland exhibition.

We spent 2 hours at the Future Worlds exhibition and all thoroughly enjoyed it. You do not need to be a child or with a child to enjoy this exhibition. We could have stayed longer, too, but had tickets to the Wonderland exhibition and thought it best to move on.

The Wonderland exhibition is one for fans of Alice in Wonderland. While my husband and I enjoyed it, having grown up reading it and seeing various versions of the movie, our kids were not ‘wowed’ by this exhibition.

If you’ve got the time to see visit this museum, I certainly recommend it. The Future Worlds exhibition was a memorable experience for us all and is a long standing exhibition at the museum so will likely be there if you visit. You can check out details on their website."
,,Interesting.,3.0,,One good way to spend your day with kids. We got tickets for both Artscience and wonderland. Kids enjoyed it to some degree.
,,FutureWorld Exhibit,5.0,,The mix of art and science was really cool. Wish we'd had more time here. Lots of the exhibits are interactive.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Went to this museum in 2018 and my order and I loved it. This year he was 3.5 years and loved it even more.

The Wonderland exhibit was over his head but the main interactive digital one was superb. The VR forest experience was good too."
,,Poor customer service/staff,2.0,,"Got the all access tickets...but got confused on the timing specified on the ticket. I assume it was for the Alice in wonderland...but i need to make sure with someone. I asked 4 people, and they dont have any clue and ask me to go to the ticketing office. Those staff i approached are manning the exhibits, which i assume...they should know what tickets are they accepting.
Anywy, we went ahead with my assumption and proceed with Alice first. Then we wento for lunch, and went back for Future and Utopia.

Alice in wonderland is ok if u have little kids in tow. But the tea party, very unfriendly staff (guy). Maybe the guy assumes everyone knows the rules. Tsk tsk, he even argued to one tourist. He is askng for 4 more people to take seats, the foreigner group is 3, so basically she can. But its like he shooed them away, until the girl argued...then they were able to take the seats.

Future world is ok, the last part... staff always makes you to walk and do not just stand...how can people take their photo???! And of course people will understand the queue, everyone wants good photo.

Floating Utopia- you can skip this."
,,Future Wonderland,3.0,,"Being Sands lifestyle members, we used the 1-1 option, although the catch was the 1-1 only applied to standard (non-Singaporean) price and not local price. The counter staff, Catherine, was not very helpful and undeniably rude. If not for the kids looking forward, we would have turned back (separate feedback has already been conveyed to MBS). The Future World exhibition was cool, innovative and educational. The kids loved the interactive segments and enjoyed themselves. Wonderland, however, promised much, but was not really up to par. Sure, the exhibits on original literary works of Lewis Caroll and videos of first ever live adaptions of the classic story was interesting, but there seemed to something missing. The map provided also had riddles to keep the kids busy while they maneuvered the exhibitions but they soon lost interest. The digital interactive Mad Hatters Tea Party was a non-event despite the hype. Save for projected graphics, it was nothing to shout about. Overall, FutureWorld, although an exhibit that’s been around longer than Wonderland, was way better."
,,Wonderland @MBS,3.0,,"If you are an ardent fan of Alice in Wonderland, then this is the place for you as the exhibits do go into details of the main characters. Well organised exhibit, with numerous versions of Alice, a few versions of Alice were a bit eerie looking. Not sure little kids will like the exhibit. All in all, I don't find it worthwhile a visit.

Tips:
Join free Sands membership and get 1 for 1 ticket (include child ticket).
On non school holiday and non public holiday, Fridays are free for kids with an adult ticket purchase.
Museum opens at 10am, no need to go early as they ONLY open the doors at 10am sharp."
,,Wonderful place for the family,5.0,,"One of the best places to visit in Singapore, especially if you are with young kids, but also for adults with a sense of fun too.

We actually bought our tickets through Klook but realized our mistake after we saw a sign saying that on that particular day children could enter free of charge. But we did take advantage of this by buying adult tickets at the ticket office for Wonderland and the children got in free.

We started with Future World which my kids went craxy about. My wife and I also had terrific fun. We coloured in pictures of cars, rocket ships, buses and trucks and then scanned them into a machine and the next moment our drawings were floating across a huge screen on roads. We must have spent about half an hour playing around here.

There are several activities like this, another with butterflies where you can touch them on the screen and they fall down. And another where you colour in things and they are displayed moving across the screen. I have to say this again, that my young children had an absolutely brilliant time. I believe there were about six or seven activities here and they were all fun.

The second attraction here was Wonderland with an Alice in Wonderland theme. This could involve adults more than the previous attraction and was enormous fun. It included exploring different areas and looking for clues and doing several other activities. The one we enjoyed the most was having a photo taken of our faces and then seeing ourselves as a playing card with arms and legs and our silly faces bouncing around across a large screen.

So as a place to bring young children I would say definitely visit the ArtScience Museum. For young couples or couples with a good sense of fun then you will also have fun here too. The visit was really worth it and was one of the highlights of our trip."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"It's a good attraction for children, for teens not so much except for the photo spots that are so cool and instagram worthy."
,,Name of museum is not an error in grammar,5.0,,"It's not Art and Science. It's not even Art/Science. It's ArtScience, because the two disciplines are seen as one, and the whole museum is dedicated to proving that theme. A feast for the eye, the mind and the soul, for adults and for children. Just jaw dropping. And it was an extra bonus that they were having a special exhibit regarding Richard Feynman, who went to the same high school I did!"
,,"Great architecture. Quality of the exhibits varies, and mostly suited for kids",3.0,,"The ArtScience museum is worth a visit for its architecture. Once inside, the exhibitions are not always overwhelming and do not totally meet expectations. The current ""digital meets art"" exhibition, in partnership with Tokyo's teamlab is more of a young kid's playground.
Likewise, Wonderland is better suited for fans of Alice's adventures..
OK for a couple of hours."
,,"Seriously, this place is only for kids",3.0,,"You can't think of this place as an art exhibition space, rather as a venue designed for hosting children's parties and school excursions. As two 30 year olds without kids expecting a series of cutting-edge light installations, we felt horribly out-of-place at the ArtScience museum.

We were finished in 10 minutes: the interactive light installations used in all the publicity are simplistic and very small in reality. In between these two photogenic spaces are countless activities just for children, including a small slide, crayon drawing stations and a ball pit. Even though they were all in gleeful use by a large school group, it was hard to ascribe any of these activities with the artistic or scientific merit suggested by the museum's name. Considering how expensive admission is, it was a major let-down due to the huge disparity between reality and museum's marketing."
,,Nice place to spend couple of hours with kids,4.0,,This is a digital museum. The most exciting activity for kids is to draw and scan the drawing into a digital character that will come to life on the screen.
,,Great exhibition,4.0,,Me and my friend are travelling and we went to see the future world exhibition. It was great definitely worth the money. The exhibition was interactive and would be great for children.
,,Modern art display.,3.0,,"Cool building, a bit pricey but you get a discount for joining the Sands Reward program. Art display was small (took less than 10 mins to see them all)."
,,Mind-blowing high-tech exhibits,5.0,,"Trying to describe how amazing some of the exhibits are would be nearly impossible; the technology involved is incredible. You just have to visit!

We had two people with us who were initially very vocal about the fact they didn’t like “museums” and were sceptical of what this would be about. They loved it!

The ‘Future World’ exhibits were all about people interacting with art and science. For example, you could colour in or draw a house, plane, car on a regular piece of paper and then quickly scan it and watch it be added to a giant, animated virtual city, alongside everyone else’s creations.

There was a dark room with a virtual waterfall where the presence of people in the room disrupted the flow of water just like it would in nature.

Basically, I highly recommend it and you should check it out for yourself! Allow about 90-120mins depending on whether you have small children, as there’s plenty for them and they could want to stay a while!

Overall I’d give it 71 out of 77."
,,Adults Should Cost Less Than Kids,3.0,,"I was really looking forward to this museum. I had heard such great reviews and everyone raved about it. Yes, this is a nice museum and has some great attractions. However, if you are an adult you will be done this museum fairly quickly.

I did the regular museum + Alice in Wonderland. The entire time at the museum was around 1 hour. The Alice in Wonderland exhibit was done very well and I am glad that I added that onto my regular ticket. You get to see from start to finish how Alice in Wonderland has progressed, and go through some obstacles as well. It is a very fun exhibit and I would certainly do this one again.

The main exhibit however was a bit dull. It is great for kids so if you have kids this is at least half a day. I saw plenty of families playing around with a lot of the different objects they have throughout. For adults though I would say this isn't a must-do while in Singapore. I went here while it was raining and it was perfect for that. Besides the light display that I am sure you have seen all over Instagram there isn't too much more to it. I spent most of my time inside the light display.

So, yes, there is a lot here to do for families but if you are an adult and / or by yourself I would say you can skip this. I would do the special exhibit though no matter what!"
,,Nice Museum,4.0,,We visisted the museum and to be honest weren't that keen on paying to go in. They do have some free things that you can do such as Into the Wild interactive tour. It was pretty cool and great for kids. Also on Level 4 there is a show and a theatre movie you can see but need to book in advance.
,,"Interactive displays, great for kids (of all ages)!",4.0,,"This museum lives up to its name - art married to science! It is an experience for the senses, and is especially wonderful for kids who are free to play with any of the exhibits. The first exhibit is a multitude of colors all around you (floor, ceiling, walls, etc.) The sixth and final exhibit displays 176,000 lights to replicate the universe as we know it. You have to ""walk the plank"" through this maze of lights - fascinating!"
,,What a fun museum,5.0,,"So, unfortunately, I didn’t take a lot of photos but did take a lot of videos which I can’t post on here. The FutureWorld exhibit was absolutely amazing. It was an interactive exhibit! So cool. The first room was a bunch of flowers and butterflies on all of the walls of the room (and the ceiling and floor), then the rain started and so did the amazement. The water would move around your feet, then when you moved, flowers would sprout up. It was so cool!

The next room was the FUN room. There were so many things to do in this room and it was great for kids of all ages. The first thing was a slide with projected objects on it, when you touched them stuff would happen (the cherries would explode and ricochet off other objects). The next part was a table with wooden objects (mountains, water, trains, homes) that when placed on the table would create that object on the table. If you placed 2 of the water objects, it would create a river and if you put the train markers across from each other over the water, it would create a bridge and the train would travel between the two markers.

Next up were drawing stations that you could color a pre-drawn picture then scan into the system so it would be projected onto the wall. There was a Hop Scotch course that was generated by 3 different computers and you actually jump down it. There was so much to do in this room, I couldn’t take it all in.

The Minimalism exhibit was very interesting, but we really should have done that first. It was so much more subdued and thought-provoking that it was a big change after the Future World exhibit.

Overall, this was such a great museum, it was almost surprising that it was associated with the Marina Bay Sands hotel."
,,Art meets science,5.0,,"Awesome family (teenagers) activity. We saw this advertised on Instagram. We purchased tickets at the last minute on-line; it seemed this was necessary as the other exhibition was sold out on the day we visited. Registration was a bit painful due to all the details asked.

We only visited the Future World exhibition so can’t comment on the other one. There was plenty for adults and kids to take in and do, including drawing, then having it scanned to appear on a large screen! The 178,200 LED light display was amazing.

Highly recommended."
,,Wonderland Exhibition FANTASTIC,5.0,,This exhibition was amazing... I was in my element being a HUGE Alice in Wonderland Fan I could t have been happier. In terms of an exhibition building the art science museum is modern and clean and well airconditioned 😉
,,Quick easy entry into a wonderfully executed and immersive exhibit,5.0,,We visited the 'Wonderland' exhibit and it was brilliant. Very well executed and fully immersive. Happily surprised and not excessively priced. Took about 90 minutes without rushing.
,,Fantastic architecture but regular exhibits inside. Better for kids rather than adults.,3.0,,Fantastic architecture but regular exhibits inside. Better for kids rather than adults. I expected more. Nice if you are curious but not worth the money spent there.
,,Beautiful Architecture,4.0,,Go here if only to admire the architecture. It is located really close to the Marina Bay Sands mall and the interior and the exterior of the building is a work of art in itself.
,,Average,3.0,,"Our morning here was fine, but nothing special for the price we paid, $27.20 for both exhibits with discount for showing our Singapore airlines boarding pass. We preferred the Future World exhibit to the Minimalism."
,,Future World,4.0,,"Really nice museum. Had two exhibits, Really enjoyed future world. Especially the area where you color a page and scan. Once scanned the picture comes out on a massive video screen and is added to hundreds of other moving images.

Really cool experience but price was a bit high."
,,Future world exhibition,5.0,,"We got tickets for both the Future World exhibition and the Minimalism. With young kids, I felt that we should have missed Minimalism as it has beyond their comprehension (and mine too, in all honesty). The Future World exhibition is a permanent fixture and great fun for both kids and adults. I recommend you check whether they have ticket promotions for marina bay sands memberships - they usually do. I didn’t do this and missed out on their 1-for-1 tickets! The membership can be signed up for online before you go so it really is quite easy to get one."
,,Good exhibits on display,5.0,,"They have different exhibits on each time of the year, that come from all over the world. The exhibits that I went were amazing. I saw a marvel exhibit in the museum."
,,Really Fun,5.0,,"The ArtScience Museum was a really fun surprise and a worthwhile visit. I wasn’t expecting too much, but we really enjoyed our 2-3 hours here. The FutureWorld exhibit is more oriented to those with younger kids, but is still very enjoyable for adults and teens. Participating in each of the exhibits makes a big difference. If you skip over a couple you may feel that you are done before you even begin. However if you participate in each (eg making drawings that come alive on the 3D screens) it truly enhances the visit. I would definitely return."
,,"A diverting couple of hours, not sure about the 'science' or 'museum' aspects",4.0,,I took my 4 year old daughter here and we had a fun time. A good choice if the weather's bad and you need to find something to do that isn't watching a movie or shopping!
,,The Exhibition Was The Highlight,5.0,,"We went here several times but never with children. So when we went there with our 2 and 4 yo it was a blessing that the exhibitio. of PlayLab is for children mainly. They loved it and came back again at the same day. I won't recommend this place for family with young children if there was no children friendly exhibition. My children have gone to many museums before. They went to museums or exhibutions in Paris, Barcelona, Rome, Amsterdam, small ones in Venice, Vicenza, Kobe etc you get the point and they were in awe with everything but my 4 yo said she didn't like the museum upstair except for the clock. Will try National Gallery next. But... I like this small museum a lot. Don't know what will improve their ratings among families with really young kids. They are kids anyway but their opinion matters for their parents."
,,Super fun!,5.0,,"Specially for children. My husband and I enjoye it very much and took many fun pictures. We also went to the Minimalism exhibit at the 3rd floor, very cool!😀"
,,We loved it!,5.0,,"When u see an art, it's not about the artwork itself but how u feel about it. Some people might say it's interesting, some people might say it's boring, well I'd say we loved it!

My husband and I went there with a group of friends. It was a very hot & humid day in Singapore, so to go to this place was a perfect choice because it is indoor & fully air-conditioned.

It is children friendly too. There's an area specially designed for children, or even adults, as long as ur child is not afraid of darkness."
,,"Not worth visiting, but the building is interesting",1.0,,"We were really disappointed with this place. The price is high given what is there and the quality of the displays is low. Not sure why there are such high reviews. I found the light displays and art to be very boring. The only really interesting part of the whole place is the building itself which cost nothing to see. I would definitely not recommend paying for and going inside this place, but would recommend seeing the structure."
,,Minimalism is Challenging!,4.0,,"The museum has drawn together some 150 exhibits of minimalism. Some are thought provoking, if your not a creative type, time is required to absorb what the artist is looking to achieve. Reading the accompanying description to each exhibit is a necessity."
,,The future within!,5.0,,"It’s not a typical kind of museum wherein you can find a portrait or history of a certain place, this museum is more on a futuristic one!. All ages(even kid at Heart)can visit ArtScience museum and for sure you will amaze and enjoy it!.

When me and my sister visited the museum, we purchased first the ticket online coz we don’t want to fall in line and wait for a long queue. The ticket cost around $26.95 (99 aed) per person (we bought it on Klook). The museum Opens daily from 10:00am-7:00pm, and their Last admission is 6:00pm. Either you can take MRT or Bus to be able to visit this place.
For MRT : 10 minute walk from Bayfront Station (CE1/DT16) or 15 minute walk from Promenade Station (CC4/DT15)
For Bus : 97 or 97E and get off at the bus stop of marina bay sand hotel at bayfront and from there you can walk going to the museum.

Me and my sister really enjoyed it and felt like we are in the other world."
,,Worth the Visit,4.0,,We are really not into museums but this one is definitely worth the visit! We had a lot of fun taking some picture and drawing little cars to throw into the virtual city. Since it is within the marina area I think is easy to add it on a daily trip.
,,Impressive museum in Singapore,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands is one of the top destinations in Singapore and the ArtScience Museum plays a large role in that. The first thing you will notice is the incredible architecture, not only of the the museum but of the surrounding outdoor space and shopping mall. Inside the TeamLab exhibit is a world unto itself. I was told when I bought the ticket that it was designed for children, but when I went aside I think the adults were more enchanted than the children. It is digitally stunning and very interactive. Everyone seemed to have a great time engaging with the exhibits. I only wish I had more time to explore thoroughly the rest of the museum"
,,Nice exhibitions,5.0,,"I went to 2 exhibitions.

The TeamLab exhibition is so famous worldwide and it didn’t disappoint me. The setting was so pretty and I love the interaction between visitors and different projections.

I enjoyed the Minimalism exhibition too as the art pieces show what “less is more” means. The museum is very big and gives you a lot of space to see the art pieces in different angles and think.

Staff there were helpful and nice. Recommended!"
,,future world ...,4.0,,"I think the exhibition is a nice place to see augmented reality as a type of art. It isn't really ""future"" but it is nice to see and you can have much fun, because of the interactive images.
I would recommend to visit the exhibition in the evening."
,,Not so future world,2.0,,"I went there for the future world exhibition with a friend. The staff was a bit unfriendly in the string lights room. The staff at the entrance asked us to rudely to put our bags in front of us so our bags wont hit any of the lights, which is understandable but the attitude really made us feel unwelcoming. They kept asking us to move forward even though it was quite empty. We just wanted to appreciate the different shades of lighting. Also the passage way was a bit narrow so our backs accidentally touched the string light once but we already immediately walked off, the staff rushed to us and told us off impolitely. We really felt like we were in military school and kept getting told where to go and when to move. You could really feel the staff did not want you to stay there even though there was barely anyone."
,,High tech and impressive design,4.0,,"The building is a modern architectural masterpiece, a design that excites imagination. Located in Marina Bay Sands, the surrounding area is great for pics. The Future World exhibition was very interesting, in case you have children. Otherwise, apart from the high tech effects and the digitally enhanced environment, it's not that interesting for adults. We visited even the Richard Feynman exhibition, which was far more interesting, a presentation addressed mostly to adults. Lovely pond with water lilies."
,,Absolutely Abhorring Service,1.0,,"I must say that the ONLY place that I did not feel welcome in Singapore is the ArtScience Museum. It is such a shame that a place which should encourage inspiration and should bring a lot of tourists in Singapore has chosen unwelcoming and ride staff, in particular the gentleman who told us off in an undermining way at 6pm saying ""Good night"" and said that the sysytem is off when there were clearly people still buying tickets, after we spent 20 minutes shopping in the souvenir shop and considering the fact that the shown closing time is 7pm without any further announcement and without any consideration for the people already in the queue. Really sad because I find Singapore the most amazing place with the most lovely people otherwise"
,,Glimpse Of Future...,4.0,,"Right at the heart of Marina Bay Complex , the museum’s unique gravity-defying architecture showcases art, technology and culture all under one “roof”. The Marvel Studios and Wind Walkers - Jun-Sep 2018 exhibits was awesome!"
,,Digital Interactive Installations,4.0,,"I once visited the Future World gallery in 2016, and I revisited it this year along with my trainee who is intellectually disabled but enjoys art. The gallery was not very big, and the installations seemed pretty much the same as when I visited in 2016, even though I read that it was supposed to have some new installations. The Sketch stations were still enjoyable, although the crayons were in rather poor condition. The Crystal Universe was also beautiful, but there was a crowd and the staff constantly told us to hurry. It was also nice that with a Future World ticket, we could get free access to the Digital Light Canvas at The Shoppes, B2. I would love to see new installations by teamLab at the ArtScience Museum (such as the planets and lanterns installations they have shown in other exhibitions, or better yet something completely new), and with better crowd control."
,,Our Favourite Weekend Hangout,5.0,,"We love ArtScience Museum, especially the Future World Exhibition. We have been here countless times. It’s just such a great place for young children to play, to draw, to be surprised, easily to spend 1-2 hours here in an afternoon. Future World Exhibition is interactive, is fun, children love it. Museum made effort to update the content from time to time to keep it more attractive to regular visitors like us."
,,Future World - Go for it,5.0,,"We visited only the future world exhibit in ArtScience museum..it is worth it..the exhibits are breath taking..The first one is interactive and you can see the butterflies fall down when you touch them. My little one was running around touching them.. They have a set of fun activities for children which is equally fun for adults as well..see you drawings come to life ..I read in a review that the led balls make sounds but the place was so noisy that we didn't hear anything.. the last installation is just breathtaking..led lights display accompanied by music. When you walk through them you enter a different realm. Best part, you get to choose the pattern from a touch screen kept in the viewing area. I loved the wave pattern which puts life to the lights.."
,,watch your masterpieces come to life,4.0,,"this as a very interactive museuam. i felt like a 10 year old child drawing flowers, ufo's, cars and building then scan then and watch them come to life. i love the giant cubes and bouncy balls that light up in different colors. it is heaven for Instagram addicts. my favorite was the cristal universe. i have an obsession with chandeliers and now i think a have an obsession to built my own room with floor to ceiling mirrors and twinkling lights!"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"If you are staying in the Marina area of Singapore you will see this unusual designed building lit up at night multiple colours and designs projected to the outside of this building. The iconic lotus inspired ArtScience Museum is worth visiting.

There are exhibitions, events, performances and educational activities here, the Museum explores creative processes at the heart of art,science,technology and culture and their far- reaching influence in the world we live in.

We visited one morning and decided to see the Minimalism, Space Light Object section of the museum . We really enjoyed viewing this exhibition one is able to photographs there as well as some interactive displays.

How to get there?
Get the MRT to Bayfront Station then it’s a ten minute walk.
Bus there is a bus stop at Bayfront Avenue the follow bus’s go there SBS97,97E,133,133M,502,518, or SMRT 106.
Taxi pick up and drop off near The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands.
Car the nearest car park is the North Car Park at Marina Bay Sands.

Opening hours 10am-7pm with last admission at 6pm."
,,Great for kids,4.0,,"The ArtScience museum was a great surprise stop while visiting Singapore.

If it’s not your first time in Singapore it’s definitely worth stopping by.

The permanent exhibition “Future World: Where Art Meets Science” it’s a great experience if you have kids, but also good for the insta shots."
,,Great for Kids,5.0,,Took our Granddaughter to see the Future World exhibition. She is 14 months and loved it. Great lighting effects and opportunity for kids to draw pictures and see them appear in the displays. Would recommend for all children up to teenager and the Adults have fun too.
,,Worth it for that Insta shot,4.0,,We only really came to take photos in Future world for Instagram. And It was well worth it. Had a great experience walking through all the displays. And photos did well on my Instagram haha.
,,Future World exhibit is a must!,5.0,,"I was looking for something to keep me busy and help fight jet lag after landing in Singapore on a Sunday morning. This exhibit was well beyond my expectations - one of the most memorable art experiences I've ever had. Most simply, it's art created with light that responds to your interaction. While much of it is child friendly (and there will be lots of families and kids) it is a joy to experience as well as to watch little kids enjoy. You realize these kids are growing up taking these feats of technology for granted. The exhibits are emotionally moving as well as playful. Pay close attention to details, be patient to watch the art evolve and you'll gain a deeper appreciation for the work."
,,Interesting place to keep the kids busy.,5.0,,"We went there for the Future World exhibition. It's fun for toddlers of any age up to teenagers, even adults get to play happily with those interactive games. Its indoor setting makes it a fun place no matter it's too hot or too wet outside, and we can easily park the car under MBS. Will take time to visit other exhibitions with the kids again."
,,Is it ART or is it SCIENCE,4.0,,"Interesting exhibits, some interactive, are here to stimulate your mind and your senses. Lucky enough to catch the Richard Feynman exhibit. Super fascinating guy and worth the admission price alone. But is it ART or is it SCIENCE? Maybe its both but either way its well worth a visit."
,,Unique Museum,3.0,,"We went there on a Saturday morning so there were lots of tourists, it was still enjoyable and memorable experience. Highly recommend to people who love technology and art"
,,Great. Future World is the Best.,5.0,,A great attraction. Would reccomend doing. Have been to Future World exhibition many times - it is great for kids.
,,"Superb location, nice place to visit !!!",5.0,,"ArtScience Museum is located within the integrated resort of Marina Bay Sands in the Central Area of Singapore. It was opened in 2011 and is said to be the world's first ArtScience museum. Although this place has a permanent exhibition, ArtScience Gallery, the ArtScience Museum mainly hosts touring exhibitions curated by other museums from all over the world.

The building itself looks like a beautiful piece of art and it looks especially stunning at night with various light effects. Must visit the place to atleast admire the structural beauty !!! Tickets are not very expensive."
,,Worthy Visit!!,4.0,,"Very unique - as its name suggests, it features not only art created with advanced technology but also using art to explain technology as well. Small venue, emphasis on special exhibitions. Fee adds up to see all special exhibitions. Came during Singapore Art Week that it joined National Gallery on Minimalism."
,,Review of art science museum,5.0,,Amazing museum. Easy to get to super cool reality mixed with amazing projections. Kids will enjoy so much but adults also will enjoy quit a bit. The staff are super friendly and explain how things happen which makes it lot more enjoyable every now and then you have big crowd of kids flow through. I wish they better plan that flow. Also if the kids are better directed they would enjoy more and learn more.
,,"An intriguing Museum featuring ""international touring"" exhibits.",4.0,,"This Museum is centrally located and is a part of the ""Marina Bay Complex"". The shape of the building is unique--- as it resembles a very large ""Lotus Flower"". The architect is the same one who designed the Marina Bay complex with the ""SkyPark"" (430 metres long) and cantilevered ""Infinity Pool""... as well as other interesting features which become evident when one pays a visit! The Museum has 21 Galleries and covers about 50,000 square feet. The travelling exhibits change on a regular basis, and are very exciting! Many exhibits have an ""interactive feature"".

I hope that this Review has been helpful."
,,Best museum for all ages!,5.0,,"I had low expectations of this visit but it was fantastic! The exhibitions are well worth the $15 entry. We ended up spending several hours here. It’s truly amazing. Essentially a modern/technology based art gallery. It’s interactive for all ages including adults. It’s more art than science, just that it’s art created with modern technology. It’s right at the end of the helix bridge beside the marina sands shopping centre. And the lotus lake outside the museum is also beautiful."
,,Excitement for the young one.,5.0,,"Our daughter really had a fun time here. Same with all the children, and I believe parents. Paid for just the basic admission - future world. This includes entry to the digital light canvas located at B2 of the Marina Bay Sands mall (besides the overpriced from of court). While the museum was also expensive for what you actually get (not a traditional musuem at all), the kids really seemed to be excited throughout. An hour easily goes by, and another half hour for the digital light canvas."
,,Average place,2.0,,"There is a lot of hype that has been built about this place. There is nothing really experiential here. A lot of optics and very little content. It is more like an amusement place for kids (and a very expensive one!).
At the end, we were left wondering what this was all about - it was neither an experience center, nor a museum in the true sense. We felt very disappointed.
Even my 9 year old was not impressed!"
,,AMAZE 💙💙💙💙,5.0,,"We visit ArtScience Museum Future World + Digital Light Canvas on our 2nd days in Singapore. Again, we booked our activities through the traveloka website, it cost IDR 129.105 per person. This is worth it!"
,,Wonderful Teamlab Exhibit,4.0,,"I first heard of TeamLab from my son who visited the TeamLab main exhibit in Tokyo.Teamlab is Tokyo’s newest, hottest museum dedicated entirely to digital art, and it's the first of its kind.

I was actually planning to go to the Tokyo exhibit until I found out through their website that they have three installations in Singapore one of them is at the ArtScience Museum in SIngapore.

I therefore decided to check out the exhibit at the Art Science Museum in Marina Bay during my trip to Singapore in November and the digital exhibit was something new for me."
,,Good for kids,3.0,,"We visited during Future World exhibit, as two adults this was average, if we were kids it would have been brilliant. Hangy Crystal world thing was cool but I would probably not go again. All exhibits have additional ticket fee, would be better if you just paid entrance fee and could visit all areas of museum. Set up/layout of museum is weird too."
,,Good for kids,2.0,,"We visited only Future World exhibition, which is quite interesting for younger kids who can play there and draw various objects, people and animals, scan them and then they appear live and moving on the screen. However not worth a visit if you don’t come with kids."
,,Excellent exhibitions,4.0,,My wife and I went to see the “All possible paths” exhibition which turned out to be absolutely excellent and so glad we attended. Then we saw the “Future World” exhibit which was good but would have been even more enjoyable if we had 3 to 11 year old children as there were so many fun things for kids to see and play with the exhibits.
,,Terrible 24 min experience for adults,2.0,,"The entire exhibition took us 24 min to experience. This is not a artmuseum, this is an expensive playground/kindergarten. Everything is made for kids, great if you are a family- terrible if you’re not.

Great if you have kids age 1-11. We couldnt interact or appriciate anything because of the hundreds of kids screaming, running and falling in front of you. The noice was so loud that We left.
And the crystal universe- it is about 5m long and staff rush you through it so you cant stay more than 1,5 minute.

Worst spending in Singapore. The Spectra watershow is a 100 Times more touching and artistic than this dark playground."
,,Must if you are going with kids,4.0,,"It is a nice experience, enjoyed future world but a lot of interactive exhibits are for kids, so add it to your list for atleast one visit"
,,Worth a shot,4.0,,"The exhibition that we went was about minimalistic art. So by showing very little, we got to experience very deep feelings by the artist. I really enjoyed myself with my friends thought i wasn't really a ""museum"" person."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Thankfully when we went (when it opened at 10am on a Saturday) there was not yet many people and we could enjoy the exhibitions quite thoroughly! The Future World exhibition is definitely eye candy and mesmerising with it’s different colourful and sensory displays. I wish there were more exhibits as we finished exploring it pretty fast! Definitely recommend this for children as it is quite interactive, but for adults without children you may finish viewing the exhibit pretty quickly! The minimalism exhibit was also pretty cool. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Took us around a couple of hours to view both exhibits!"
,,FutureWorld: Inexpensive yet not entirely worth your money,3.0,,"A lukewarm experience overall. Of the 7 or 8 exhibits on display at FutureWorld, they certainly saved the best one for the end. However, a lot of the interactive exhibits in between are primarily for kids under 13, so you don’t really come away feeling like you’ve learned anything new or seen anything that can leave you truly awestruck (barring the final exhibit which is admittedly quite cool). The aesthetics of FutureWorld are great for social media fanatics, however."
,,Amazing Building,5.0,,"Architecturally beautiful to look at - a piece of Art just on its own. We went to look at the interactive Illumination exhibit.
The kids really loved it (even the teenager) - they especially liked the illuminated balls and the Crystal curtain room at the end.
We also looked at the Minimalism Exhibit there at the moment."
,,Future World exhibition,5.0,,"Visited the museum for Future World exhibition. The staff at the counter was polite and helpful. The exhibition was fantastic, showing how the future could be with technology.

The Crystal Universe exhibit was the best. With more than 170,000 LED lights, it gave the illusion of stars moving in space."
,,Heavy handed,1.0,,"We did think a Sunday morning stroll around Marina Bay Sands area would make a great first day out in Singapore recently. The architecture, particularly the Helix Bridge, the hotel and Art Science Museum, is great eye candy. It was around 0930am and we innocently assumed the Art Science Museum was open judging from all the movement we could make out inside. I walked in and up to the concierge desk to purchase tickets, quite enthusiastic to be there. Within seconds I was surrounded by staff telling me to get out, literally hustling me out the doors (which were then locked immediately). Unfriendly. Unhelpful. Unbelievable. Security trumps goodwill and commonsense, apparently, in this place. And there was no sign to say it was closed, none to say when it might open. We didn't go back. We took our 4 kids and spent our money elsewhere. Disappointing."
,,Young at heart - future world,4.0,,"We had a long Singapore stopover and decided to check out the future world exhibition. The lady at the reception was very helpful and told us that marina bay sands was doing a 2 for 1 promotion if we sign up to a free membership. Was fairly easy process and we ended up paying only $19 for the two of us.

The future world exhibition is very interactive and fun using lights and screens. There were a lot of children however we also enjoyed “playing”.

Took some amazing photos. There is also an additional entrance to a interactive experience within marina bay sands shopping centre."
,,Future World exhibition regulars,5.0,,We are regulars when it comes to the Future World exhibition. I have an annual pass and bring my one year old boy here because he loves all the interactive and colourful displays. It’s the best to see the wonder in his eyes. Highly recommend it for families with kids but it’s also great for adults only.
,,Refreshingly different.,4.0,,"We decided to visit because the reviews were good. There were 2 exhibitions on when we visited, but we only went to one, which was the Future World Exhibition.

It was a very different experience to what I thought it would be and very colourful and well laid out, with hands on for young and old alike. Although there is not a huge amount to see, what was there was very tastefully presented."
,,"Eye opening, not for family with kids though",3.0,,"Enjoyed the unique art works on display. Modern and engages you into the minds of the artist. The place is kept quiet and serene by the many security personal. However they are not too friendly towards the young kids. I don’t blame them as the works are fragile and little hands like to touch!

The basement has a wonderful light show for the kids though that’s worth trying out."
,,A visual and intellectual treat,5.0,,"I chose the ArtScience museum as I had two (not so interested) teenagers with me. But it was a pleasure to see the girls engrossed during the entire visit.
The exterior of the museum is beautiful and one wouldn't mind spending time outside the museum, soaking the sights of the Marina Bay. There were three exhibitions on when we visited - future world, All possible paths (Richard Feynman) and Minimalism. The huge exhibits, complete with digital technology, colours, light, sounds, notes tickled our senses. My favourite was the sliver LED light curtain through which I walked feeling like I was in Interstellar!
""Into the Wild"" - is a immersive virtual experience more suited to kids, where you walk in the corridor with iPads.
There could be a requirement to deposit your belongings for some exhibitions and refraining from flash photography."
,,Interesting and informative,5.0,,It’s an interesting visit because the museum is very informative and interactive. There are also a lot of exhibits that are children-friendly. A must visit in Singapore.
,,interesting experience,4.0,,this is definitely not your typical boring museum. it's very interesting experience that you should visit at least once when you visit Singapore. Also very suitable for children as there are many coloring/drawing activities in the museum and adults can do the activities too.
,,Lives up to the name,4.0,,This is the 2nd time I have visited this museum and I was impressed once again. They have combined technology with art and produced some excellent exhibits. The best part is that it is very interactive and there is something for kids and adults both. The staff are very friendly and helpful. This is not a boring museum at all. Don’t miss this if you are visiting Singapore.
,,Fascinating experience!,4.0,,"I went there alone before catching up my flight back to Jakarta. It was fascinating to experience a creative, modern and breakthrough mixture of art and science. You can spend 30-45 minutes if you explore the whole area by yourself. But if you bring your kids, I think it's going to be longer since they provide a lot of interactive displays for kids (drawing, playing with lights, slides etc). It's a pity that I didn't go there with my kid, but I definitely wanna go back there with her once I'm in Singapore. The price is also reasonable."
,,An interactive museum for everyone,4.0,,"There are different exhibitions available, based on the ‘season’ you go , so search it up on the internet before going.

I went for the ‘Future World exhibition’. However, when I was at the ticketing counter , the person told me that one of the stations was closed due to upgrading works (space). It was kind of disappointing because we had one less exhibition to go to but nonetheless it was a great experience.

Future world exhibition comprises of nature, town, space,park and sanctuary stations. Visitors get to experience digital art. Young children can also colour and scan their artwork for it to be featured on a big screen. Its also a great place for photography shoots due to the array of colours."
,,Futuristic art,5.0,,Located in the world famous lotus a like shaped building in marina bay sands complex. Children friendly place to play with virtual technology and science. Several exhibitions can be show in the same time. Recommended for family outing.
,,"Lots of things to see & do, even for kids.",5.0,,"Worth the visit. Not crowded. Plenty for kids young & old to enjoy. Adults also would benefit with the exhibitions we saw very informative and challenging. Staff very helpful, great little gift shop too."
,,Amazing Interactive Experience,4.0,,"the light show is the most documented piece here but the whole exhibit was more interactive than i thought. the kid in me had fun tapping on screen and coloring my ""avatar"" who i can see after scanning my drawing. photography is encouraged here. we spent about 2 hours here and i really had fun. it was unfortunate that the digital light canvass in shoppes was closed for the day. i would have really enjoyed running around then."
,,More interactive than expected,4.0,,There were only a few exhibits but they were very interactive. Lots to do and see. You could easily spend a few hours here. There seemed to be lots for kids too.
,,Innovation and art experienced.,5.0,,"So besides being an amazing building/work of art itself, this museum contains a long term exhibition (Future world) and a variety of shorter term exhibitions on other floors. if you have kids, then future world is just awesome. It features an interactive light and sensory and craft experience. it's also huge. There's not 4 things to create, build, try, play, slide down etc... theres LOADS!!!! From whole sensory rooms with surround interactive light shows to pictures you colour then scan and upload to interactive walls. BUT IT GOES ONE STEP FURTHER... -- it can take your scan upload it to another machine and print a card template for you to make a 3D MODEL! It was super great. I made one there and printed the rest to take back to the hotel to do later. They won't survive the suitcase home but were fun to make.
While I was there, I saw a graffiti exhibition on the upper floors, though I think that part of the exhibition space changes regularly and tickets for those are sold separately.
Don't miss this."
,,Good light show,4.0,,"I would describe the building as like a 'hand' or a 'baseball glove' which is interesting in itself and the location by the marina is excellent.

The Future World exhibition is a series of rooms whereby you can interact with light displays both on walls and on tables. Quite fascinating and intriguing. The children in the museum were having loads of fun.

The 'Sanctuary' room was particularly fascinating as was the 'Space' room. However in this room the staff were hurrying you through the walkway so this spoilt the experience slightly.

The third floor was being prepared for another exhibition so nothing to see there. The top floor there was a short animation with animals and I guess the message was protect our planet.

Overall a good visit"
,,Amazing museum,5.0,,"Very very impressive , def something to do , try the future world , it was so beautiful and the kids would love it as well"
,,What an experience.. stunning,5.0,,"What an experience . The art science museum is a treat for the eyes and the mind. Everything is so rich and engaging

The LED room reminded me of Matrix. The butterfly exhibit was mesmerizing. But my favorite was the one where I could scan my images and they would come on the digital screen and become a part of the civilization. It's such a nice experience for kids and adults both.

Loved it, my best stop at Singapore."
,,Exhibit Fantastic But Skip Cafe,4.0,,"My wife and I loved the Future World exhibit. Disappointed that this was the only exhibit available today (19 Oct). But, don’t go anywhere near the cafe. Must be the most expensive coffee and muffin in the world!"
,,Really nice museum,5.0,,For me this museum was one of the highlights of my visit to Singapore. They had multiple exhibitions but all three where in their own way really worth while visiting. Also the building on it's own in a marvel from the outside as well as from the inside.
,,A lot more fun than expected,5.0,,"Came here during the last time slot of the day and wasn't too busy, although the queue for the LED lights room did get pretty long towards the end. Lots of beautiful digital displays like the flowers and waterfall, and the slide looked quite cool as well.

This is definitely more of a kids place, but we actually ended up having a lot of fun (kids at heart!). We also enjoyed the room where you can do crayon drawings that come to life on the big screens.

Only thing I would suggest is that for the room with all the LED lights, most people going in just seem to want a good photo, but there was a staff member just standing in the middle the WHOLE time at the end, which was pretty annoying. I feel like that prolongs the people in there trying to get a good photo because then they are trying to find an angle where someone (aka the staff member) isn't just loitering in the background of all the photos. It's actually much more efficient just to have a staff member standing at the entrance and the exit of the room to tell people to hurry, than having someone stand in the centre and ruining people's shots."
,,Always love coming here,5.0,,"This is my second time visiting this museum and i fell in love with Teamlab's exhibition. There were 3 exhibitions at that time and i chose the pass including Teamlab and Marvel. If you are a student, you will get discounted price when you show the valid student card."
,,Nice Museum,5.0,,"I came here to see the Marvel Cinematic Universe 10 Years Exhibit, and I must say, it did not disappoint. I was at awe at all the attractions they put up, they were so up to scale as they were in the movies. I particularly liked the Ragnarok exhibit and the Thanos statue.

Will definitely drop by again when there is a cool exhibit to see."
,,Some fun free options,4.0,,We weren’t that interested in the current exhibit but did have fun doing the free “Into the Wild” virtual reality walk around in the basement and also enjoyed the short video on the curved wall on the top floor. Interesting building.
,,Hand shaped building,4.0,,Modern architecture with world class displays on offer to see. A great innovation and always a wonderful place to visit and see on the edge of marina barrage. Recommended to visitors to Singapore.
,,Not-a-bored Museum,5.0,,"Located in the prominent area in Singapore, ArtScience Museum showed a not-a-bored Museum to visit. Combination of art and science appeard even in the properties towards and out the museum, i. e Helix Bridge (which inspired from double helix of DNA) or big concave-convex mirror at the front of museum . Impressive building and convenient place, made me have a new way to enjoy the museum/exhibition in it."
,,Well worth the $19SGD each admission,4.0,,We do not usually bother with museums but decided to give this a try as it was pouring with rain. You can pay to access one or all of the exhibitions. We chose to see the temporary Theo Jansen's Strandbeests Wind Walkers exhibition which was fascinating and was brought to life when the curators gave a talk and demonstration of the larger machines! Well worth the $19SGD each admission.
,,Excellent immersive experience for kids and kids at heart,5.0,,"Our family loves going to the ArtScience museum. Apart from checking out new exhibits, we make it a point to regularly visit one of its permanent exhibits, Future World. This technology-based, highly visual, interactive exhibit is a big hit especially with younger kids, and shows us how technology can build up more creativity. We recommend this exhibit to all families with young kids. There is also no shortage of promos to save on entrance fees. The museum has an ongoing promotion on Fridays, allowing up to 4 kids to enter for free if accompanied by one paying adult. If you are a Marina Bay Sands Lifestyle member, every ticket you buy entitles you to another one of the same kind for free! Applying for the MBS lifestyle membership is also free; simply present your passport at the MBS Lifestyle booth at Shoppes at Marina Bay."
,,Ok to kill free time,3.0,,We only went in because we had time to kill and its air conditioned. Otherwise I wouldn't put it very high on the list of things to do in singapore. Kids would enjoy the future world section with its interactive visual graphics so take them if they need occupying for an hour or so.
,,Futuristic building,4.0,,"The Art Science Museum building is in the shape of a lotus flower. At the entrance there is a pool with lotus flowers.

The tickets are on the pricey side. The ticket counter is located in the basement floor. I went with my young daughter and we saw the Future world exhibition.

There was an exhibition on art based on a light show. Inside the main hall - you had the opportunity to draw a fish and then scan it. This then appeared on the wall as if it were swimming. Clever technology indeed.

In the central part there was an area where there were bouncy balls. There were lights with spherical light shades.

In terms actual things to see - I did not think there was a lot. But you have to marvel at the technology that makes the exhibits interesting."
,,Marvel (dont bother),2.0,,"This was overpriced and of poor quality, a young fan would find this very boring.

I just wish we read the reviews beforehand, this whole thing took us less than 20 mins to look around. Then when you got to the shop the place was half empty."
,,Interesting “ future world” exhibition,5.0,,Beautiful spot to take pictures of the area. Beautiful building. Good activities for children and teenagers- Marvel exhibits of super heroes is great too.
,,It’s ok,3.0,,"We were excited to visit the ArtScience Museum solely because of the interesting design of the building itself. We visited the Future World and Marvel exhibits. Both were ok, but I wouldn’t recommend visiting either."
,,Finally got here after 4 visits to Singapore,4.0,,I was very fortunate on this trip to be able to see the 10 year Marvel installation at the Art Science Museum. There was multiple installations to visit and you could spend a few hours here. I was also lucky to see an artist use a 3D printer at the entry of the museum create some cool pieces
,,Interesting building,4.0,,"Visited here as we were in Marina Bay, and also went to the Marvel exhibition held here. Building is very interesting itself and is distinctive on the waterfront. Signage inside the building needs improvement!"
,,Great Combination of Art and Technology,5.0,,"ArtScience Museum must be in your visit list when you are in Singapore. It's an extraordinary museum that you have to see, especially for family with young children. Kids will be happy and enjoy visiting here. The ambience itself makes you comfortable to be here for long duration.

How to get here?
The best way for me to get here is using MRT, to Bayfront Station. When you arrive in Bayfront MRT station, there will be clear direction either you want to go to Garden by The Bay, or to Marina Bay Sands. Follow direction to Marina Bay Sands.
In the other hand, the MRT station itself has direct connection to Marina Bay Sands. So, you will walk along the direction with fully air conditioned area.

After reaching the Marina Bay Sands, you will see direction to ""Museum"", follow it. The museum is easy to find and located outside Marina Bay Sands.

What can you do here?
The museum has some exhibitions which divided into permanent and temporary exhibitions. I was visiting double exhibitions : Future World and Marvel Studio. Although they are small, but worth enough to be visited

Future world is a permanent exhibition which combine art and technology by Team lab. This is the best place for children and adult. Your children will be excited to play light ball in the park, drawing fish/car and put it into the screen, sliding, and any other else. The ambience is very comfortable to let children play and for parents while waiting them playing.
Unfortunately, the crystal universe was renovated during my visit here.

Second exhibition that I was visited is Marvel Studios (10 years of Heroes) which only several steps from Future World Exit.
Marvel Studios is a temporary exhibitions that was informed will be ended at Sept 30th 2018. This exhibitions very amazing. You can see the history of each heroes also their statue which really similar with the real one. You can see Iron Man's costume changing, Dancing Groot, Captain America's ship, etc. They also play short Marvel's movie. Don't forget to take picture with all Marvel's movie cast.

☉ When is the best time to go here?
Morning - Afternoon

What is the best outfit?
I am not suggest you to wear specific outfit.
You can wear fashionable dress while taking pictures in Crystal Universe or Future World or any clothes that comfort you

,,Awful and Overpriced,2.0,,"Was very excited to come here, but was soon let down as we were told that 60% of the main exhibition was closed.
We bought tickets for the Marvel Studio Exhibition instead which was embarrassing. It had lots of information and reported all the movies and their release dates...but i could have found that on wikipedia.
The statues and displays were very cringeworthy and poorly made. The whole experience was very overpriced for very little to show for it.
However, the ArtScience Museum is a gorgeous building, especially at night when it is lit up in front of the Marina Bay Sands"
,,Expensive but interesting exhibits,4.0,,We went to two exhibitions. Marvel Studios 10 years and Wind Walkers: Theo Jansen’s Strandbeests. The wind walkers included live demos of the sculptures moving by being pulled along or powered by compressed air. I enjoyed the engineering aspect of this but comparison to living creatures was pushing the boundaries a bit for me. The Marvel Studios exhibition was interesting but a little shallow in terms of information and actual exhibits. Worth a visit though.
,,Really enjoyed the Marvel Studio exhibition,5.0,,"I thought this was a great exhibit for Marvel fans. For those that are not caught up on some of the newer characters you can get all the information about these characters before trying to understand and watch the newest Avengers movie. And, for those like me who know a little more and have seen the Avengers: Infinity War movie you can still get more information about your favorite characters. I also loved being able to take pictures of all the huge Marvel heroes figures. Since my favorite is Dr. Strange I was thrilled to be able to stand next to him for a picture. There were also some of the interactive fun things to do. Definitely enjoyed this exhibition."
,,Not your ordinary museum,5.0,,"Recommend to buy online ticket before you go. The museum has many interactive arts and games such as slides, neon balls. We spent about 2 hours. Nothing much for adults but young kids will have fun."
,,Over priced for boring exhibits,2.0,,"This building looks amazing but sadly that’s where it ends, the current exhibitions looked fun and exciting but after paying almost $70 for a couple we found it to be boring and lacking in any substance. The Marvel thing was basically a commercial for the Avengers infinity war and was a complete waste of time and money. It would be ok for kids but save your money and walk along the lovely waterfront."
,,Where art meets science,5.0,,Well worth the entry price we did two of the three displays. This place is also great for kids with many interactive art displays. I found myself standing in front of many things for longer than I anticipated.
,,Standbeests Exhibition,4.0,,We went specifically to see the Theo Jansen exhibition and it was a really cool way to spend an afternoon. Staff were helpful in allowing you to interact with the Strandbeests. Architecture of the museums itself is interesting- very good visit overall.
,,Marvel and ArtScience,5.0,,My wife and I did the Art science and Marvel exhibitions. We really enjoyed the crystal light part and sat and enjoyed it for quite some time. The interaction with the exhibition was really enjoyable and made for a really fun day. The Marvel exhibition was pretty fun. I can see those that love the movies and comics and kids to enjoy this 10 fold. It was cool to walk around and see and learn different things
,,Went to future world exhibit with a 9 month old,5.0,,"My daughter is crawling and the future world exhibit was great for her. A bit like baby sensory but on a large scale!
Although she didn't understand the interactive projected images she had great fun with the illuminated balls, cubes, slide and interactive music wall.
Will go back a second time before heading home."
,,"Very poor, not the usual standard of the ArtScience Museum",2.0,,"For a 10 year Marvel Studio exhibition this was very poor and a complete waste of money and time. To showcase the movies and its main characters you'd expect at least various movie props, costumes, set pieces, etc but nothing like it. It's a very short meander past plaster versions of the main characters and very little explanation of their universe along side it. We were expecting something like the Harry Potter exhibition that was here some years ago and where you could really relive the movies. Even if it had half the experience of Harry Potter it would've been worth it but this was terrible and hopefully not an indication of future ArtScience exhibitions.

The stitched together trailer of several Marvel movies at the end in a special ""theatre"" room really said it all."
,,Good gallery: wind walker,4.0,,We only visit one gallery: the wind walkers. It is good for teenagers. For youngers it is good if you will explain exactly what's going on. On specific times there is a guided tour in English. It is full of innovation
,,Interesting morning,4.0,,We visited the Artscience museum because my partner wnated to. I was pleasantly surprised The Marvel Studio 10 year exhibition was amazing lots of things to look at and lots of interactive experiences! We both loved it! The windwalker exhibition was also very interesting and the staff did a talk about this which was very informative and had good structure with lots of demonstrations. Unfortunately the third exhibition was closed for refurb and some prior warning wouldnt have been nice but this is only a small criticism! Definitely worth a look especially if you have kids/teenagers.
,,"Nothing special, just go if you have time!!",3.0,,I visited this place when I got some free time in the afternoon. It was OK but not mandatory. Just visit only if you have free time. Better place for kids.
,,Great museum all ages,4.0,,"I visited this museum because the curiosity was quite high, so attractive and educative. Very impressed with the contents of this museum and want to feel like going back again"
,,Great exhibitions!,5.0,,Visited it spontaneously after seeing advertisements for the 10 year Marvel exhibition. Saw two different exhibitions there and both were fantastic - well thought out with lots of interactive possibilities. Ended up spending a lot more time there than I originally thought. Fantastic museum!
,,Museum with lotus flowers,4.0,,I always bring any family members and friends visiting Singapore to Art Science Museum. The building itself is quite iconic and unique and lotus flowers nearby the museum are very pretty and picturesque. Easy access from the Marina Bay Sands!
,,Marvel and wind walker,4.0,,"Visited the ArtScience Museum for
1) Marvel Studios: Ten Years of Heroes and
2) Wind Walkers: Theo Jansen's Strandbeests

Both exhibition were informative and especially for the wind walker where there is scheduled demonstration for the various strandbeests (which meant beach animal)

The museum is well organised and is very easy to moved from hall to hall. If you drive, do park at mbs carpark"
,,Marvel Experience,4.0,,The ArtScience muesuem is currently showing '10 Years of Marvel'. Decent price to get in and its good if you have kids who love marvel characters like Thor or Iron Man. Most certainly a cool place to go!
,,Good,4.0,,"Its a nice place with various events and the bulding is very unique, close to marina bay sands mall exit."
,,Some great exhibits at the Muesum,5.0,,"A good outing while in Singapore, especially if the weather is a bit off. This science museum is part of the Marina Bay sands shopping complex, so there is plenty to do around this area. We were lucky enough to see two diverse displays this month. One was the Marvel Studios ten years of hero’s , which was done very well and the other was the wind walkers by Theo Jansens strandbeest, which was totally fascinating and educational. Plenty in there for the kids to do as well. Well worth the visit."
,,Enjoyable but feel they could offer more,3.0,,"Very interactive museum, one of the exhibits was closed when we visited which we were not aware of before hand which was a shame. Lots of opportunity to get involved, however felt it was a little small given the price. I don't think it is well advertised but we bought our tickets from the theatre in the neighbouring shopping mall, which was a good shout as when we walked a few minutes to the museum the queue there was over 20 minutes according to the signs."
,,Great Marvel exhibition,5.0,,After watching all the Marvel films over the last 10 years it was great to visit the museum and see all the films pieced together. There are some mini clips for you to watch from the cast and producers where they describe how they feel about the films. Now a Marvel film marathon is needed!
,,"Techie art, artful science",4.0,,"The ArtScience Museum is great for those who love art and science. My son had a wonderful time interacting with the exhibits. There are several galleries you can visit. We were fortunate to see the Marvel exhibit this time.
I appreciate how they brought science and art together - logic made beautiful."
,,Wind Walkers: Theo Jansen’s Strandbeests,3.0,,"We went to see exhibition as one of the must!, My son is a big fan of the artist since 2 year olds, i played video clip of this art instead of cartoon, then it was bless to know this exhibition is held in south east asia, we fly to see this exhibition without hesitate!

The exhibition was good as it's standard, fit the place perfect esp. the main high-light hall.

But the worst thing happened when my son was stopped from a staff when he was carefully moving the beast (experiment zone) as he is too small and can't move 'her' smoothly, and again when the small group lecture come (only 2 people with booking?), then we need to leave as we run out of time to the airport.

I was admired the place as it's part of shopping mall, great ideal to connect people with art as apart of life but now this art seems to unreachable like it was before or still in some developing country...

My son seems to lost his interest on the main highlight but still making his own beast by lego (he is 7 year olds) Luckily when staff said 'No, you can't do it!' doesn't haunting him."
,,Unexpected Fun,5.0,,"We went here for the light show except it was not open at that time. Thinking we'd maximize the trip, we opted for the other shows... and boy did we ENJOY!

I do not remember the price but it was minimal considering the loads of fun we all had!
things we did: virtual aquarium where you color the type of sea creature you want, scan your work, and then wait for it to appear in their wall-sized screen aquarium, The trick is to scan scan scan so you see your art work in the form of a school! hahahhaha

The same gist for the cityscape except you choose between cars, trucks, buildings, and planes.. try the buildings since they stay on the screen and twirl for you whenever you poke them

Light room that tells a story on the walls, ceiling, and floor... amazing!

And the wave room where you can enjoy soothing waves in motion while relaxing on the bean bags.

Lastly... try out the LED slide. I saw all ages even grannies enjoy this."
,,I expected more and disappointed,1.0,,Not worth the price. I suggest you to just enjoy the building exterior from outside. The exhibitions were terrible. I bought the tickets for the Marvel 10th Anniversary Exhibition and it was a joke. Not many statue figure and the quality were bad. So disappointed. And the other exhibition like the wind walker and the future something were also disappointing. It will be better for you to shop on the mall inside or enjoy the scenery outside.
,,Best Natural Exhibition,4.0,,"I Visit in Priod Of Treasures Of natural World Exhibition.This is Wonderful.A lot Of Masterpieces Specimen From The Natural History Musem,London Showed Here.One Thing Make Disappoint is No Map No Information In Marina Bay Sand.A few Person Known This Exhibition."
,,Small Exhibits,2.0,,Beautiful exterior. Amazing architecturally. Saw two exhibits. Too small and quick for the money. Each took about 15-20 minutes. $68 for family of 4 to see Wind Walkers and Marvel
,,Quite Disappointing (Marvel),2.0,,"if u and your children aren’t marvel fans, entering this museum is totally disappointing. there are just statues of heroes and stuffs and the show is quite boring. no spiderman and no captain america statue. definitely is not worth it for $19 (adult price, saturday) . the only massive statue and good one is the iron man one."
,,Fantastic exhibitions,5.0,,"We visited 2 exhibitions currently available in ArtScience Museum. One is the Marvels 10th anniversary exhibition and another one is the Future World by teamlab and both are very good for a great afternoon especially you would like fun stuff. The arrangement is so cool and fun. If you love Marvels, you may love the exhibitions. Overall, the experience is memorable for kids and adults."
,,Worst museum ever! All art no science,1.0,,We paid $19 a ticket for a terrible wind walkers exhibit that was incredibly boring! We wasted our money and time in this museum and I would not recommend even one of the exhibits to anyone. I thought Singapore could produce something a little more interesting and interactive! There is zero science in this museum... maybe it’s good if you like abstract art. The outside looks nice though
,,Not a Museum at all,1.0,,This place should be called an exhibition hall because it is not an Art Science Museum. To pay $16 for one exhibition that doesn’t lead to anything else is a rip off. We also realised while still standing at the register we wanted the windwalker exhibit and lady wouldn’t let us change. So we spent stupid money to walk through a Marvel Exhibition which is not Science...is called Hollywood!!!! And a movie! Wow so disappointed that this was a museum.
,,Marvel exhibition so so so bad!,1.0,,"A small collection large action figures, minimal to zero scientific value. I cannot express how disappointing this was."
,,Awe Inspiring Exhibition,5.0,,Very much enjoyed taking a look at the Wind Walkers exhibition. To go behind the scenes and understand how Theo Jansen creates his Strandbeests was very inspiring. The science and thought behind these incredible moving sculptures was breathtaking.
,,Creative and fun exhibitions,4.0,,This is a great place to visit. The building itself is a work of art and within houses some very clever and creative spaces. The light area and the specialist exhibits are interactive and interesting and give visitors a chance to play with technology and learn new things. There were plenty of families when I went and for good reason. The building is located just next to the marina bay sands mall so it’s easy to include in a day visiting that area.
,,Windwalkers; Future; Marvel,3.0,,"Windwalkers is rather interesting and good but a small scale exhibition. Marvel is really meant for hard-core fans and can be rather boring for most. Future is interesting and a great fun place for kids. All in all, one may not find it worthwhile the entry fee unless there is a promotion such as kids go free on fridays.
Tip: Join Sands membership for free and get one-for-one entry ticket.

,,MARVELous,4.0,,"Went there with my children to see the “Marvel Studios 10 years of Superheroes” and were not disappointed. They used state of the art technology to give us - superhero fans, a unique experience of the Marvel world. It is definitely a “must see” exhibit."
,,‘Marvel’ ous visit,5.0,,"This morning, my 11 year old and I visited the Art and Science Musuem at Marina Bay Sands. Although we have been living in Singapore ever since the Musuem opened, this was our first visit. Rather than forcing a visit on our son, we felt it was better to wait until he was ready.

So we were pleasantly surprised when he expressed keen interest in trying out something new and pointed to the Art and Science Musuem while surfing TripAdvisor.

First of all, I must say the location of ASM itself is a big attraction. The promenade is simply breathtakingly gorgeous. We the population of Singapore really are very lucky to have such a beautiful landscape to enjoy, completely free!

ASM made quite a splash when it opened with a unique lotus styled architectural design. All of which had no meaning as we settled into a fun day between dad and son. The musuem itself is quite small and probably doesn’t need more than half a day to tour. My son was so enthralled with the Marcel Studios exhibition (no surprise there given all the Marvel Comics superheroes are ruling the roost these days) that we went there twice! But importantly we also enjoyed the Future World exhibits with the computer generated graphics for ocean waves, the mathematically accurate water fall and almost real looking aquarium. So also, the Wind walkers exhibit and Theo Jansen’s work was a big hit with all the strandbeest creations from PVC pipes. Lessons learnt includes global warming and the rise of sea levels as well as Singapore’s response to rising sea levels (hope the lessons stick!)

The ‘In the Wild’ rainforest game was a hit too; spotting mouse deers, pangolins, tapirs and saving the rainforest from fire all in a day’s work.

In summary a time well spent on edutainment!"
,,Future World is Great for Kids,4.0,,"Highly recommend visiting future world on a Friday when kids get in free. My 4 and 1 year enjoyed the full exhibit of interactive activities during our recent trip to Singapore. We stayed at the Marina Mandarin Hotel and it's a short walk to the museum. The outside area offers beautiful views of the city. We were somewhat disappointed in the Marvel exhibit, though they did warn me it wasn't super kid friendly, but my 4 year saw super heroes and we couldn't pass it up. It's somewhat pricey and really only takes 15 minutes. I would skip and check out the Super Hero Cafe if you really just want to see figures (DC vs Marvel, but my 4 year old doesn't know the difference). If we hadn't gotten in for free I would have been more disappointed, but I was only out my own ticket so not too terrible."
,,Where art meets science,4.0,,"The architecture is innovative and beautiful. Love the way they use light in creative and interactive. There are many events here, you just pay for whatever you want to see. Absolutely worth a visit."
,,Small but interesting museum,4.0,,"I went there back in November 2017 and they had the lights installation which everyone has a picture of on Instagram, it is a pretty exhibit but so small! The museum itself doesn't have that many exhibits but it does have a big section for kids, though I'm not a kid it was fun to join in the drawing section which you can then project your drawing onto a massive aquarium on the screen."
,,worst exhibit ever!!!!,1.0,,"lame exhibit, wax figures and video clips at exorbitant prices. long queue and everyone was simply being hustled from station to station. no space to take photos, no 'wow' experience. retail area was a joke with a few stuffed toys and t-shirts, expensive too. not worth the time and money spent."
,,A Must Visit for Kids,5.0,,"We were lucky to experience an interactive art and science exhibit, where there's a slide, drawing station, and other fun / educational stuff for kids. The Marvel exhibit was an awesome bonus!"
,,Innovative Museum,5.0,,"Multiple exhibits in a small space but excellently done. The Marvel exhibition is worth seeing for all Marvel fans, with plenty of interactive exhibits for both adults and children. Future World is brilliant for young children with each exhibit offering an opportunity to get involved in some way. We saw an exhibition of Theo Jansen's Strandbeests which had lots of information and multiple demonstrations throughout the day. They also offered a free immersive game, in which you used a tablet to learn about wildlife preservation."
,,Wonderful Museum,4.0,,"Singapore's iconic lotus-inspired ArtScience Museum is a wonderful place where exhibitions, events, performances and educational activities are held. Located next to the Marina Bay Sands, the museum simply enhance the beauty of the area. Attended the Marvel Studios 10th Anniversary Exhibition recently and was amazed with the spectacular sights of Stark Tower, Wakanda, traverse doctor Strange's light portal and so on. Another exhibition is the Future World where Art meets Science, a futurisic world of high-tech interactive experiences created in collaboration with teamLab, a renowned Japanese interdisciplinary art collective."
,,Future World,5.0,,"Designed to intrigue young kids and the family, Future World is a pleasant surprise and lots of fun in a/c so a nice break from the outdoor heat. This is a digital showcase with some great interactive pieces including fun slide, glowing bouncy balls, projected waves and you can draw and scan it into the digital AR world. Loved it."
,,Awesome place with great staff,5.0,,"I purchased an events ticket for Marvel superheroes and sand walkers.
Those two experiences held my attention for a few hours of fascination.
I would thoroughly recommend this facility as they change the exhibits on a regular basis and are very professional in their presentation.
I would go back at every opportunity if you enjoy physical science."
,,An afternoon well spent.,5.0,,"Spent an afternoon with friends here. Got all access tickets and took our time starting with Marvel, to Future World, to Wind Walkers, and last but not least, we managed to catch The Hedy Lemarr Story.

Marvel Studios exhibit was mostly informative with little interactive pieces. It gave you a walkthrough experience, meeting Iron Man, Captain America, The Guardians, Dr. Strange and ""in real life"" explanation of the science behind the weaponry and their worlds.

In Future World, you start off with a crow's eye view, flying and bursting into colors and patterns. Note that it may cause motion sickness. Trick is focus on one object through the journey. Don't worry too much as you come out to lulling waves and you can relax for a few minutes to recuperate. This was my favourite part of this exhibit. After that, you'll find a series of interactive art and displays. Overall, very interactive.

Wind Walkers felt like being in Da Vinci's workshop. It was awareness raising and a solution oriented approach. It was interesting because it was an exhibit that veered away from the digital and computer applications in the previous exhibits. This was purely mechanical, environmental friendly, earth saving, and pro active. It was really nice to feel the propulsion of energy when you got to interact with each piece, how each piece felt different from each other.

The best part was wandering into the theatre a minute before Bombshell: The Hedy Lemarr Story began playing. What a wonderful way to end our exploration. You must catch this while it's running. I will not spoil it but all I'll say is that she was beautiful and brilliant till the end. Thank you Hedy for making our day and leaving in our hearts forever the lessons you learnt.

Thank you ArtScience Museum for the amazing selections."
,,Must visit!,5.0,,"My 3yo daughter really love the artscience museum.. she enjoyed her sensory experience and all the things in this ‘future world’... but unfortunately the light exhibition is currently under maintenance at that time..
But overall, it’s amazing experience in here! Must visit if you go to singapore.."
,,Fantastic sensory experience!,5.0,,Our 3 boys loved it - proclaimed by our 8 year old as the best museum ever! We just did the future worlds exhibition but that took up the majority of the morning with the boys bouncing from one display to the next.
,,interactive place for kids to enjoy!,4.0,,We went on a Friday. Friday is their Friday Family day so kids enter the museum for Free with every paying adult tix. the kids enjoyed the playmake session best. u need to grab extra tix (SG$5) to participate. first come first serve for the first 20-25 kids (not too sure what's the exact limit). the kids can bring back their own creation!
,,New level of technology,5.0,,"It has three paid exhibitions - (1) Wind Walkers (2) Marvel Studio (3) Future World. Another part ""Into the Wild"" is free.

We loved Future world. It took technology to the next level. Kids will love this place, but that does not mean that this place is not for adults. Though we spent 2 hours here, could have easily spent another 1-2 hours.

Marvel Studio: Go here only if you are into avenger movies.

Wind walkers: Currently, they are exhibiting Theo Jansen’s Strandbeests. There are “beach animals” made of PVC tubes, cable ties, recycled plastic bottles, and sails; they could walk when pulled or blown by the wind. There was also a little crafting corner.

In case one takes Marina Bay Sands membership (which is available free of cost), the standard ticket is available at cheaper rate and also, 1+1 and 2+2 (one or two tickets are free on purchase of one or two tickets). If one does not wish to visit all three exhibitions, options are available only for 1 and 2 exhibitions. There are other offers like children tickets are free on Fridays. Check their official website for latest offers."
,,Always enjoyable world-class exhibitions,4.0,,"We always visit ASM every single year as a family. This time it's 10-year Marvel Studios exhibit and an updated Future World exhibit. Both are amazing! My pics here are understatements, you should come and experience yourself. Some displays are so well-presented!"
,,Fun for the family,5.0,,This place is great for kids and reasonably priced. We got there bait late so missed one of the exhibitions but still thought it was worth the $$$
,,Marvel exhibit,1.0,,"Static, immobile, unmoving papier-mâché or plastic statues of marvel characters and artefacts in front of painted marvel symbol clad walls and Lo-tech lighting effects. Hardly anything interactive for kids or adults to engage with. The finale is a series of disjointed clips that hinted at including you or your Favorite character somehow but doesn’t.

An exhibition sold on brand alone without any redeeming substance. My kids (9 & 11) are ardent fans mumbled wtf’s under their breath after the ‘thank you dad!’ ...."
,,Marvels and more,5.0,,This exhibition of the Marvel Universe was great. We also enjoyed future world. Stunning combination of art and science. Kids of all ages (including the grown up kind) will find something they love here.
,,Disappointed,5.0,,Went here after hearing rave reviews about here . But completely not for us and left . The water Lilly pond outside was magnificent though.
,,Fabulous Architecture Art,4.0,,"Enjoyed the exhibits held there. But if you’re not too sure about which exhibit to see, make sure you ask the details first. One of the exhibits was rather more for kids than adults so was kind of disappointed. Plus once you exit the place there is no reentering upon a paid exhibit. Overall fun for a couple of hours the most."
,,Wind Walkers Exhibition,5.0,,"I visited the Wind Walkers exhibition featuring Theo Jansen’s Strandbeests on its opening day. The Insights Tour led by Theo Jansen in the opening weekend was exciting and insightful. He shared about how his “beach animals” were made of PVC tubes, cable ties, recycled plastic bottles, and sails; they could walk when pulled or blown by the wind. Among the 13 Strandbeests on display, we could have a go at pulling 2 of them. Visitors could also view other Strandbeests in action during the reanimation tours held several times a day. By the afternoon, several Strandbeests needed repairing, but this was understandable since the Strandbeests on display were fragile “fossils” that no longer functioned as well. There was also a little crafting corner, though I wished the crafts could have been more closely related to the exhibition (e.g. making a mini leg). I think this exhibition is well worth a visit if you have seen and been curious about the Strandbeests, or have a deep interest in subjects like physics, mathematics, and the arts. Do visit the ArtScience Museum official website when planning your visit to include a guided tour and/or reanimation tour. From now till 30 June 2018, 1-for-1 single exhibition tickets are available for the Wind Walkers exhibition.

If you have 15 minutes of spare time in the ArtScience Museum, you can also check out the free exhibition Into The Wild, which consists of a virtual reality rainforest walk on Basement 2 and a short film screening on level 4."
,,Great Marvel Studios Experience,5.0,,"It's smaller than i thought it would be, but i had a great time with my family. Our favorite was Doctor Strange portal and Marvel Cast photo booth. Highly recommended for family with teenager or children."
,,Artsy,4.0,,"Even though there are various free admission museums for locals, thid ond is different. I likd the wsy things are presented and the unique environment. Worth a visit for some quiet downtime or serious thinking."
,,Place for all ages,4.0,,"Quite a fun place for the children, teenagers and adult as well. Able to interact with the facilities and having lots of fun."
,,Marvel 10 Years,1.0,,"Only saw the Marvel exhibit.... Complete waste. $20 to see a couple wax figures and some screens showing clips from the movies. 30 minute line to get tickets, over hour in line to get in. Lame start to end.

Did see a guy in line with full captain America outfit. Better than anything in exhibit.

Tip: inside Sands is a DC comic cafe. Same wax statues. Also not worth it, but at least free with no lines."
,,Fascinating,4.0,,This is a fascinating building to view and a trip to the vicinity is well worth it. It's the prefect place to visit if you're someone who appreciates art or if you're interested in art.
,,"Extremely Rude Staff at the Fab Cafe, ArtScience Museum",1.0,,"The 'Fab Cafe' located in the ArtScience Museum attracts many visitors - locals and tourists alike. The fare is limited - the usual cafe menu - croissants, coffees etc and it is slightly steeply priced. They have an interesting 'makers lab' - do stop by if you are visiting with children
But the staff at the Cafe, especially a young bespectacled gentleman exhibited extremely rude and uncouth behavior. We purchased bottled juices which were extremely cold and inquired if we could have room temperature bottles instead. His 'no' the way in which he replied was quite rude; such an arrogant and rude person should probably not be catering to customers in a cafe."
,,Future World is excellent!,5.0,,"It was my first visit. I was with 2 children aged 8 and 9years old and they both had a blast!

This is a very different museum from traditional boring ones. It incorporates plenty of lighting effects and the amazing world of touch screen intelligence.

My kids and I coloured animals/vehicles/mammals on paper, scanned it and hey presto, our drawings came to live and moved and interacted with us! It was very amazing!

We spent a good 2hours at the museum. I believe this museum will be excellent for children below 12 years old. It is highly interactive and perfect for curious young ones."
,,Future world let you children explore lighting effect!,5.0,,"For who want to Drive, can consider Park your car at the Open Car Park @ Red Dot Design museum walk around 8 minutes to Marina Bay Sand ArtScience museum @ Level B2, car park here are very limited mostly Full at weekend so you come here early morning, the reason park here is bcoz the parking fee here is the cheaper that close to Marina Bay Sand about $1.60 per hours.

,,Art exhibition,4.0,,"Because of the interesting shape and design of the ArtScience Museum- believes to resemble a lotus - we were intent on visiting at least one exhibition on offer to the public.

Towards the end of May, we paid for and viewed the Graffiti Spray-paint exhibition, which has a number of very interesting pieces throughout.

Since the Museum is seen next to Marina Bay Sands and part of the picturesqueness of the Marina itself, we are happy we visited the building, went in and made the most of what it offered."
,,Awesome Art Exhbition,4.0,,"Standard Ticket Price for non-resident is 28 SGD for 2 exhibition. We went to see the Future World and the Street Arts Exhibition.

Future World is awesome and fun, especially if you have kids or are kids at heart. Don’t miss the Crows exhibition space and take a slide down the psychedelic slides too.

My wife and I drew an octopus and watched it swim around amongst the creations of other creative people."
,,Future World,4.0,,"The architecture of the building itself is fantastic. We walked through the Helix bridge to reach there. The permanent future world exhibition is what my son enjoyed the most, playing with the slide and seeing his drawing on display. I had briefed my family to be prepared for excellent photos in the crystal lights, but we were unable to take good photos because of the crowd and the walk itself is too small. Visually it is an awesome experience but not all is translated in a camera. Take a note on a Friday kids are free. Worth visiting."
,,"Small, intimate and great value",5.0,,"The perfect place to take kids - not too big, not too small but packed with art, design, digital inputs, and science. Your kids won't whine or complain because they will be engrossed from the moment they walk in - as will you! Dont miss it!"
,,Best design,5.0,,The design is very incredible. The show also awsome. Hi tech and innovative ways. Locater near The Shoppes
,,Great place,5.0,,Well worth spending some time here - especially with young kids. There are two areas where kids can scan and see their coloring handiwork integrated into the digital wall - great. Although in fairness all installations were great. We went here before strolling along the waterfront to Gardens on the Bay
,,Entertaining yet educational..,4.0,,"Came back to this museum after 2 years. Still find it interesting and entertaining.

Favorite items are: being able to put up our own name/message on the 'moving aquarium' and keep the kid company at the lighting balls small playground where kids can roll the lighting ball around.

Admission fee for adult is S$= 19 (if not mistaken) .

,,I Went To Singapore. I Visited A Museum & I'm SO Glad I Did,5.0,,"It was in 2014 that my curiosity was captured by the outside of this building. It was 2018 that I returned to Singapore and visited the inside. I'm so glad I did and had my family with me to experience it too. The natural world was on display and so was our future world. Both displays captured curiosity, offered insight and ignited imagination in ways that weren't a part of me or my knowledge beforehand. For this I am very grateful and can easily recommend for adults and children."
,,Future World exhibition,4.0,,"We had fun at the Future World Exhibition. Although most of the activities were geared towards children. For those who love taking pictures, the crystal universe at the end of the exhibit is a must! Although it may be a bit hard to take photos without other people around."
,,The children loved it and on Fridays they get in free!,5.0,,Great interactive attraction for children if they need a break from sightseeing. There are many original artistic activities to stimulate their imagination and you will enjoy it as well! The architecture is impressive and as a bonus we found that children enter free on Friday!
,,Must do!,5.0,,"According to my 11 yr old daughter, this was the best museum she has ever been to! We had planned to be there for a couple of hours, and ended up rescheduling our other plans as we stayed there for so long! We attended the Treasures of the Natural World. ""The 4D ""shows"" totally made it!"" Our favourite was ""Future World, where art meets science"". It was completely interactive and kept us there for several hours!"
,,Set your expectations beforehand,2.0,,"First of all, the Singaporen lady at the ticketing counter is rude and arrogant and kind of ruined the whole trip.
Secondly, make sure you have Sands Rewards member so you will not be overcharged for the exhibitions.
Lastly, the exhibitions targeted for young children so make sure you understand that before buying tickets."
,,An exploration,5.0,,We were amazed at the exhibits. Such a wonderful time visiting the Future World where art meets science exhibition. The amount of creativity in this exhibition is amazing. Well worth the time to visit
,,The Future is Beautiful,5.0,,A museum that displays the future. Art mixed with science. High technology converted in poetry. It's a world of surprises and a place to be amazed.
,,"interesting, educational and fun",4.0,,"The ArtScience Museum is a unique place that defies basic description and provides more than your average museum-going experience. The building is a modern art work in itself, resembling a lotus flower with separate sections and exhibits in the petals. While short on lengthy descriptions of hard science, many parts of the museum are more interactive as well as child-friendly. My only complaints are that 1) it can be difficult to purchase tickets there - I had to go to the mall across the street to get them and 2) visitors need to buy multiple tickets for different parts of the museum. This might be necessary for the Louvre or the Smithsonian, but the ArtScience Museum is small enough to see entirely in less than a day.
Other than those minor inconveniences, it is a good way to spend a few hours. The Future World section was particularly interesting. While initially seeming to be for children, the interactive state-of-the-art walls and floors and other areas and objects reacting to visitors actions could well interest a few adults as well."
,,Mainly for children,2.0,,"Maybe our expectations were too high, but the ticket includes too little for it’s price. We took the Future world exhibition, which was in my opinion mainly for kids till 12 age."
,,Unique world in iteself!,4.0,,"We only went to the Future World section, based on reviews. It was well worth the visit!

A unique 'digital universe'. It was good fun and the interactive stuff was cool.

Starting with the flying Crows to the amazing Crystal lights room, it was awesome.

As a kid, I found it great! We spent over 2 hrs there and didn't even realize it!"
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,"well, i bought the tickets at Traveloka, i think it's better bcs we dont have to queue and the price is cheaper."
,,great attraction for all ages,4.0,,"Really great museum. I went with my 18m old and 4 year old. Both really enjoyed themselves. The concepts behind the exhibits are fascinating and I would happily visit without kids in tow.
Only slight negative is that I thought it was on the pricey side."
,,An awesome experience,5.0,,"We went to the Art & Science Museum, located near MBS. Loved walking around the area and it was a hit with the kids. We enjoyed this architecture marvel, which truly stands out in the Marina Bay area and offers a unique character to the area. Lots to see and the place is well maintained and clean."
,,Awesome place,5.0,,Has a variety of activities for all age groups. An absolute treasure for children. Best place to get some insta worthy pics while having fun. The future would is truly out of this world. Astronomical space is magnificent.
,,"Great Location, OK Museum",3.0,,"Wonderful location with the hotel and shopping mall right next to the museum, also the marina is close by. The museum has some interesting exhibits but a lot of it is geared towards young children. The additional graffiti exhibition was very good."
,,Future World - 5 Star for Kids,5.0,,"The Art Science Museum has a permanent exhibit that’s upgraded now and then called Future World. Temporary exhibits are also featured usually for many months.

Future World is an interactive exhibit with a play on lights and digital technology.

There are art and light shows, a slide and various interactive play areas including setups where you can color or decorate pre-outlined drawings and scan them up onto moving screens. Have fun watching your piece of art on the screens.

Great fun for kids aged 4 and above. In general, kids are usually occupied in here for about one and a half hours."
,,Nicely designed museum,3.0,,"Cool and unique looking museum worth visiting for the architecture alone. The architecture reminds us of a bunch of bananas, which is quite suitable being located near the durian Esplanade theater.
In the museum a quote is printed; “There’s only one difference between art and science. In science, universe is in control and in art, you are”, so I guess this museum attempts to either remove control from both you and the universe, or give both you and universe control. Either way that sets some pretty ambitious expectations of the experiences to gain from a visit.
We visited the exhibition future world, and visiting with a young kid was pretty fun. Rather small exhibition but some quite exciting things for the kids to do. It’s clearly an exhibition geared towards young children so if you’re a family visiting Singapore then this is a great stop."
,,kids love this place !!!,4.0,,"If you need a place to take you kids to have some fun...this is the place. We went to the ArtScience Museum because it was very close to our hotel (Marina Bay Sands). The most fun was the Future part of the museum where they could color a drawing...scan it and watch their drawing come to life on a big wall screen. They had a slide that was like playing fruit ninja (they slide over the fruit...and the fruit would explode like fireworks...) They also had a wall that when you touched a Chinese Character (word), it would display the picture of that word (ie: the word fire would display a fire on the wall...we all loved the elephant ! :)

We also went to the graffiti art exhibit...it's not for kids...

the nature exhibit was kind of boring for kids too...just a bunch of stuffed animals.

you definitely want to go to the Future exhibit though..."
,,Awesome,5.0,,A fantastic place for children to visit. The air conditioning is very cold so grown ups not running around like crazy sliding and rolling their way around the exhibits in the Future World part might want to wear a cardigan. The light installations at Future world are excellent- my 7 year old wasn’t as impressed with the art and natural science exhibits but these would impress older children.
,,What a fun time was had,5.0,,"Most impressive, fully interactive and such a variant of art and science for all to experience. Well worth the visit and cost is reasonable. Future world was fun and kids just loved it. Great for a few hours out of the heat too"
,,unconventional and unpredictable!,5.0,,"Wow!..Just wow! This was the most interactive museum space I have ever seen. I wish I would have taken my son. You could literally spend hours in this place and still not experience it all. It is on the Marina Bay Sands campus so its really close.
Favorite parts:
Wave and waterfall rooms
Crystal light tunnel
Aquarium room
The aquarium was probably the most interesting room to me. You make a drawing of a sea creature and insert it into a machine which scans the image and animates it onto a screen that looks like an aquarium. As you get close to the animated drawing it swims away from you. It blew my mind and I'm sure this description does not do it justice. There was also a graffiti art show here with the original Sheppard Fairy Obama screen print as well as his Obey posters and a plethora of other artists. there was even a wall you could tag on or put stickers on. I was not expecting this type of experience walking in the door. I'd definitely recommend this.

Not so humbly submitted,
Michael C."
,,Cool spot out of the heat where kids can be free and play!,5.0,,Future worlds exhibit for kids was brilliant. A welcome respite from the heat for a couple of hours. It is quite dark inside because everything is lit with colours. All on one level with entry and exit points staffed so kids can run around and be free to explore. This is excellent for children of all ages and some of the activities are quite remarkable.
,,Awesome display of a world of imagination,5.0,,"We bought the all in one tickets to visit the three exhibitions at the artscience museum. The most inspiring is the Futureworld exhibit where technology and art meets and conspire to blend in with our imagination.

The other exhibits are fairly well done also, the street art something new to us.

If you need to choose just one exhibit, go for the Futureworld. Else if you have time and budget to spare, keep an open mind and support the rest also.

Overall an enjoyable experience for the entire family."
,,Pretty,5.0,,"Only went into future worlds exhibition. It’s not very big and geared for kids (altho adults can try it too of course). The best part of course the light room (? I dont remember the name). Probably Spent 30mins for that installation alone and take tons of pictures and videos there. And we got free vit water at the end lol.
The ticket for this exhibition also gives opportunity to try digital canvas at The Shopees. But again you have to compete with the kids there. The digital canvas is Not worth the $5 if you gave to pay it separately"
,,Fun place to learn,5.0,,Really fun and kids would really love it here and so do I. A lot of activities to do and learn as you play. Picturesque displays too!
,,Kids loved it,5.0,,A very interesting place to take younger kids especially with interactive things to do. Glad we chose to visit as a last minute option.
,,Fun Time,5.0,,"We opted Future World during our visit to the ArtScience Museum. It was a great experience to witness a jaw-dropping technology combined with art.

The Future World exhibition was actually a small one: so what I can suggest is try to enjoy every activity offered in this exhibition.

We visited this on weekdays, the Crystal Universe were full of people taking photographs. Cannot imagine how it would look like at weekends."
,,Interesting building,4.0,,Very interesting building in the shape of Lotus. Keep in mind that the ticket is quite expensive. It is located near Marina Bay Sands.
,,Fantastic museum,5.0,,"Not only does this building look great itself outside, it’s pretty good what inside holds too. There’s usually always a different theme or display that they’re showing. Great to walk around for a few hours. Really good set up and in a great location on Marina Bay."
,,amazing,4.0,,"This museum is located in the Marina Bay Area and it's designed to look like a lootus flower, so you definitely won't miss it when in area. It's beautifully lit during evenings. Definitely a must visit."
,,Amazing museum!,5.0,,"The architecture of the building is amazing! The inside is spacious, comfortable and clean. We bought the family group tickets (2 adults, 2 kids), because it was cheaper than buying 2 adults & 1 kid tickets. I hope one day, the museum management would consider having a family package with the option of 1 child.
First, we went to the Future World section, which was AMAZING! Our son had so much fun and did not want to leave. There were so much learning activities which were fun and engaging! The staffs were there on the look out for the safety of the children and very helpful.

Then we went to the Treasures of the Natural World, where there were so many historical specimens to look at. My son, who is so fascinated by dinosaurs and fossils, was in awe of all those pre-historical animal bones.

The street art exhibition was lovely and interesting too! It was a great combination of some brought-in pieces as well as art that were done directly on the wall!

We also enjoyed watching the short video clips they were showing on the very top floor of the building. It was very delighting to see some bean bags and lazy chairs to make viewing enjoyable and relaxing.

This museum trip has been entertaining, educative and a great memory!"
,,absolutely amazing,5.0,,Designed to look like a lotus flower and the outside building is a unique shape. We will be sure to visit the ArtScience Museum again on our next Singapore trip.
,,It's WOW,5.0,,"It's really cool place to visit! All the technologies is wow for me. They have different price for student, tourist and resident. I love it!"
,,Future World is amazing for kids and adults alike!,5.0,,"This was worth it for Future World alone. I love that the museum limits how many visitors can enter per half hour; it enhances the experience that kids can run freely and enjoy everything without sitting through crowds. My 3-year-old spent 2 happy hours there and could have continued; at bedtime, he said his favorite part of the day was drawing fish that entered the animated aquatic world.

Future World is a truly innovative kids’ museum— unlike anything I’ve ever seen!

We also walked through Treasures of the Natural World, which made my jaw drop. I learned so much, and I was amazed that the specimens were authentic! There was just enough hands-on interaction to keep my kid entertained.

Also, I just want to add that the exterior is BEAUTIFUL. The vast ponds with lily pads and sleek architecture were awesome."
,,Street art,4.0,,"Came for the street art exhibition. Certainly not my first time here, and they have such interesting exhibitions over the years

At $14, it's ok, but heads up, it's a small exhibition and you can finish in 30min tops

I learned quite a bit about street art and enjoyed the pieces by Seen, Shepard Fairey, Blek le rat, Banksy et al"
,,Dream Came True,5.0,,I have been wanting to come here since I first came to Singapore now it happened and my expectations were gone! Reality was amazing and it blown my mind with creativity and how the artists express themselves. Go to Future World with a good photographer its IG perfect. And the other sections are also picture perfect.
,,One of my favorite museum that I've ever been to !!!!,4.0,,such a creative art and science museum!!! price of ticket is a bit expensive but trust me!! it's gonna worth your money for every pennies!!!
,,Enjoy,5.0,,"Future art use light and animation and I really enjoy the experience. It's very amusing and educating. The next time we go to Singapore, I hope we will see the interior of the upper lotus flower sections. The outdoor reflecting pool was also cool."
,,Charming!,4.0,,"Don't go expecting a 'museum' in the conventional sense of the word - it isn't. It is an experiential attraction, mainly focused at children and families, but no less beautiful for all that. There is a permanent exhibition and then two extra galleries for special/temporary exhibitions. We settled for the permeanent - startling 3-D video presentations on various natural themes, which you watch from comfy bean bags or lying on the carpeted floor. Interactive features - including an Alice through the Looking Glass-like fruit and vegetable experience culminating in sliding down through a video of flowers and fruit. You can colour in a house or building and then scan it - your house then becomes a 3-D image in a vast projected landscape etc etc. We just found it all rather beautiful and well conceived. I can imagine that in the right hands and with teacher guidance it can be used as an excellent educational resource."
,,ArtScience was pretty good,4.0,,"I really enjoyed the ""Future Now"" exhibition but I wish it had more. It would be half an hour tops, and that's if you're carefully observing everything on offer. The highlight of the exhibition would be the TeamLab installation, it is amazing."
,,Expensive time wasting visit,2.0,,"We paid the senior price of S$26 to enter this haven of Art and Science. The exhibits from London well worth viewing but the rest was the normal graffiti rubbish that you can see everywhere.
I cannot recommend: this place to anyone it is a bit of a rip off and Singapore should be ashamed for allowing it to be put in place.
We wasted our money!"
,,Futuristic playground @ Futureworld,5.0,,Went with my 2 year old toddler and he enjoyed it. But i think 4 years old up will appreciate it more as there are really cool exhibits. My son kept running around and enjoyed the slide and colorful balls. I was surprised though that a 2 yr old kid needed to pay entrance as he was free in other Singapore attractions. But seeing that he enjoyed it makes it worthwhile.
,,Not as I expected,2.0,,"It was OK, with fantastic design, yet the staff were not that friendly, I would suggest they spread more smile to guests. I bought the all package ticket, it was a little overrated, I went to Science Museum in London, it's way better and free. However, good location for sure and nice coffee shop!!"
,,Not what I was expecting,1.0,,This place was on my to do list after seeing an amazing Facebook advertisement on Singapore. After finally finding this place there was a massive line to get in so I thought it must be good! There were 3 exhibitions on I couldn’t afford all 3 so I chose the future world exhibit. It was $19 a ticket so I was expecting to be really amazing but this was not the case. There were a couple of things for adults but the rest was for kids. There was nothing really indicating that this exhibition was for kids. When I got to the end I asked if that was it because it was so short it took 2 mins max to walk through the whole thing.They explained that there was more in the mall across the road but again this was for kids.l gave feedback to the staff but they just brushed me off I was really let down by this place as I was expecting so much more for the price.
,,NEED A NEW RATING UNDER TERRIBLE!!,1.0,,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!!!
This was by far the biggest waste of time we have done on our trip. Walked through the so called “exhibition” in about 2 mins which is a complete load of rubbish! I don’t even think kids would enjoy this place even though it is made for them. We were not advised on purchase of tickets that it was a kids thing.
Wife said we will give the other part a go which is located in the shopping mall, went there and even worse just a bad dance floor with lights just a heap of junk looked at it for 10 sec then back down to complain to ticket office where no refund was given even though she made me go and get the receipt upstairs off the wife to prove purchase, very very rude woman.

I strongly advise not to go here"
,,Interactive art at its best,4.0,,Despite all the children running around having fun this is for everyone. I would actually really recommend this for people who are above 50 wondering where technology will take us - this place is a good example. To really appreciate it don't stand back and let the children have fun - do it too! Colour a picture and scan it in and watch it come alive on the wall. Play with the interactive displays and see what happens. This is modern interactive art at its best but you need to interact with it and not stand back. Probably a little short for me and I think it needed some interpretation in another space so we could appreciate the the science that is used to create these works.
,,Enjoyed an afternoon here,5.0,,The multimedia exhibit is stunning. Although much of this exhibit is for children I still had an awesome time here. The various light shows are truly stunning.
,,Waste of time.,2.0,,"1. Area around the museum is nice.

2.. Science part of the museum is not really about science. It's about 5 rooms with projectors that show really poor animation (you'll get better animation in 90s video games) and one small room with lights and mirrors. It is a waste of time and money. Do not go there if you don't have kids <10 y.o. Seriously.

3. Treasures of the Natural World has 5 rooms with 30-40 exhibits borrowed from Natural History Museum in London. If you're into natural history then you've seen better collections by now, if you're not into natural history, then you'll be even less impressed by a few disorganized exhibits in mostly empty rooms."
,,interesting but not great,3.0,,"I went to see 'Treasures of the Natural World' which was an average exhibit. Thus the rating. I didn't look at the rest of the museum. The building is interesting. The world's classiest food court is in the building next door, lower level. You can have your $85 chili crab there and all kinds of interesting food."
,,Scientific Art!!,5.0,,"We didnt have too much time to spend in the the Museum. Its an interesting piece of architecture allowing the visitor to contribute and interact with the art-displays largely due to integration of technology.. The kids enjoyed it..and we became one with the kids - drawing and adding our art to the live-display. The room with the animated waves was mesmerizing and we specifically enjoyed the live, moving info-icons that shared information once tapped. A brilliant way to keep the younger generation's attention. A must visit.."
,,Great Exhibitions,5.0,,"Visited with partner last week (we are both mid 30s)

The museum itself is a quirky lotus shape, which you can’t miss as part of the iconic Marina Bay Sands skyline.

When we visited, there were three exhibitions:

- Future World
- Natural History
- Evolution of Street Art

You can choose to see one or two or all three when you buy your ticket; we opted for all three ($38pp).

The Future World was interesting but annoying; incredible installations where images / sounds / lights have been digitally manipulated, but are dominated by people using selfie sticks / amateur modelling shoots, so you are constantly waiting to look at the various exhibits.

Additionally, this is where there is the kids interaction, and they run round like cats on fire, screaming. Again, not my idea of fun.

The Natural History exhibit takes a number of pieces from the London Natural History Museum, and is superb. So many interesting artefacts and kudos for London to be showing its wares to the world.

The Street Art exhibition is their current exhibition; I think it is on for approx 6 weeks before something else replaces it.

I enjoyed it tremendously; showing the evolution of graffiti from simple tagging in the 80s, to the use of stencilling by the likes of Banksy in modern day graffiti - really really interesting.

We spent approx 2 hours here and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Whilst the Future World was ruined by kids, it would be remiss to lower the score for the museum because of this, as the exhibits are superb."
,,Not impressed,2.0,,"We visited it as a family, two adults and a 13 years old teenager. First of all, this is a leisure / entertainment place for kids from 3-4 years old up to 9-10 years old. Second, it is quite small and has not much to do with neither with Science, nor with Art...
Anyway, for us it was quite disappointing, maybe we set out expectations bar too high ..."
,,This is a great place to visit,5.0,,Warning: Instagrammable to the extreme. Loads of things to see for everyone whether you don't usually like museums or you're really into them. Make coming here a priority
,,Great for kids-full stop,2.0,,"We went into the Future World exhibition as the description made it sound very appealing. First thing we tried to sit and watch a serious art v science display in a semi-circular room, but feral kids were running around uncontrolled which made it impossible to watch. We then headed for another room and came across an unexpected slide down into the next exhibition, but had to wait until unaccompanied kids pushed their way through and threw themselves down it. The attendant tried to stop them but the parents were in the other room furiously videoing their little darlings.
The rest of that room was based on drawing and colouring and clearly designed for children.
The last room is an impressive hanging light room which would have been great except that people were just not moving through until they had taken a hundred selfies showing their best trout-pouts. Again the attendant tried his best to move people through but most seemed more intent on photographing it than actually enjoying the experience.
I applaud the efforts of the artists to present interesting and entertaining displays, but this is the age of entitlement and selfish self-indulgence, so their creations need to reflect the problems that this brings."
,,Children's Museum fun for adults,5.0,,"We went for the five year old, but we had a ball. It was the best children's museum we've ever experienced, and we've been to a lot of them in different cities. The whole thing was interactive, with things to do that I've never seen before. Draw a picture, scan it, and it appears on the wall as a moving object. You touch it, and it does different things. Really cool. Join the museum online to get 2 tickets for the price of one. Nice senior discount too."
,,The best in class,5.0,,"This museum informs, educates and delights its visitors.
We were lucky to have seen this exhibition called ""Future World - where arts meets science"". I have never seen such a delightful use of technology and visitor interaction like this before.

This one is definitely a must watch for people of all age groups."
,,Interesting museum,5.0,,"Interesting museum, future world and a visiting exhibit from the natural history museum in London were here when we went. There was a video playing upstairs. It is hard to see how the spaces available in the lotus petal would be very usable."
,,Art and Science Museum - Interesting for those who love painting & art,3.0,,The building architecture is different (Lotus shaped). The art and science museum is different theme. It has around 4-5 big rooms. There are art work (Painting). It is linked to some scientific themes. Will be interesting for those who love art and painting. Yo may need to plan for about 1-2 hours.
,,its funky,4.0,,"fgo, because you just have to honour this place. the look , the feel, the never see items you see, enjoy"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"We visited last year with my family and five year old grand daughter, it was then only intended to be temporary but it’s still going strong and that’s not at all surprising.
Fun and educational I’m amazed this hasn’t been franchised to other cities, kids under ten love it and some of the shoes are fun for adults also."
,,FutureWorld,5.0,,"A highly engaging blend of art and technology for all ages - everyone can express their digital artistic talents. Fun, interactive play happening!"
,,Amazing! Kids LOVED it.,5.0,,"We needed something to do on a rainy day with our 10, 7 and two 5 year olds and came to the Museum almost by chance. As luck would have it, is was a Friday and up to four children enter free with one paying adult. We therefore decided to visit both the Futureworlds and the National Treasures exhibit. The kids were totally entranced by the Futureworld exhibit. We spent over 2 hours in there and had to drag the kids away for lunch. The installations are very interactive and pitched at children 4-12. A lot of the exhibition involves colouring in drawings which the kids can then scan. The drawings then become part of the installation. The kids were fascinated by this and did dozens of drawings. The other installations are also very appealing to children. Each exhibit is one-time entry only, so after finishing Future World we went to the nearby Food Court at Marina Bay Sands for lunch (a few minutes walk). As luck would have it we returned just before 3pm when there was a free guided tour of the Natural Treasures exhibit. The guide was excellent and because it was ""Family Friday"" pitched the tour at the kids. It was very interesting and informative. The tour took about 45 minutes and then we spent a further 15 minutes looking at the exhibits. We may return another day to do the free ""Into the Wild Tour"". (Looked like it involved some sort of tablet device). We would definitely recommend the Museum for families with young children (especially on Family Friday)."
,,Only really interesting for under 10's,2.0,,Went to Future World with my 10 year old. Good fun interactive stuff but after about 1/2 hour she got bored. Really aimed at under 10's so don't bother going if you don't have kids that age
,,Kids loved it,4.0,,We entered Future World and I thought this was a disappointment. A few twirling lights and some lame exhibits. But as we proceeded my 8 y/o go into it. There are desks for drawing sea creatures which you scan and they go up on a wall size screen that looks like an aquarium. She must have done a dozen drawings. It's all pretty simple but she had a great time and spent nearly 4 hrs there. It may not be for everyone and kids will likely be bored.
,,SMALL BUT FUN,4.0,,Went to this place in Marina Bay and nobody can tell me where is the exact location. The signs are very poor ( in the street and in the mall ) but the effort was worthwhile. Currently they have some exhibits from the London Natural History Museum and is very enjoyable even the collection is smallish...
,,Great place,5.0,,Very nice setup and easy navigation. The exhibition very nice. Good for kids and adults. Recommended
,,Future World- a sneak peak of what is to come,5.0,,"We only bought the tickets for the Future World as the lady at the counter recommended that it is more suitable for my 6 year old. She was so right! We ended up spending up more than 3 hours at the gallery, which is actually fairly small. When you enter you are quite unsure of what to expect but very soon you are taken in by the high-tech interactive installations. Many of them offer you a chance to create something of your own (digitally) and the others either encourage you to play (the fruit slide was our favorite!) or be wowed (the space exhibit at the end). The game of creating a digital town using the blocks on a table was my son's favorite, he really loved it. The Sketch Aquarium was another fun activity. He also spent a lot of time with the huge balls that change in colour as you move them around, it is also supposed to change the music but this effect was not very clear (given how much the kids were shouting). It may not be a lot of fun if you don't have a younger one with you (given the entry ticket is quite steep), but i would still recommend to pay a visit, it is in many ways eye-opening, at least for me it was a sampling of a possibly not so distant sci-fi future."
,,Exhibitions and Science for everyone.,5.0,,Worth the visit - Treasures of the Natural World a review of scientific finds from the past and Future World a hint of what the future may bring with digital installations. The exhibitions are ideal for all age groups.
,,"Ok, but pricey for limited attraction value",3.0,,"We visited the Future exhibit. It was interesting, without young children the whole thing would take 10-15mins. Not really worth the entry cost of S$15each. My 10yo liked the exhibit and even he said it wasn’t worth the money."
,,Interesting exhibition Human+,5.0,,"This was an interesting exhibition, Human+, with a robot that talks to you and this is not the future. Great idea!"
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Art and Science Museum was quite disappointing experience. There were a couple of interesting installations but if you have been anywhere else in the world in this type of the museum don’t expect to find any thrill here.
Additionally, tickets are too expensive for what it offers and I left place with the impression that I just wasted money.
Building is interesting from the outside, but that’s probably the most interesting about this place.
Might be entertaining to kids."
,,Temporary exhibitions usually worth seeing!,4.0,,"My favourite museum in Singapore though it is a paying one for Singapore citizens while the other public museums are usually free for us. However there’s always a reasonable senior discount and the temporary exhibitions have depth and intellectual appeal eg the Andy Warhol, Impressionists and the Natural Treasures on now.
The building itself is eye-catching with white lotus structure floating in the lily pond, and internally, it’s also environmentally friendly, making use of natural light. They have now moved ticketing to the basement which leaves the entrance for displays though I don’t see very attractive visual displays here . Better to have a cafe here as in the National Gallery together with an interesting gift shop. Must say the gift shop near the current exhibition is kitschy, no one would want to buy anything here!"
,,Out of the World Experience,5.0,,"We had the amazing opportunity to experience the TEAMLAB Space and Science Expo. We allocated 2 hours for this event, and I wish we had just a little more time."
,,Essentially a children’s playground,1.0,,"We took a visiting relative here who is an astronomer and a highly qualified scientist and this was such a disappointment, I was quite embarrassed.

Please be aware this is probably a great ‘attraction’ for kids (we had a four year old with us and she was reasonably amused) but really there was nothing particularly scientific about the exhibits. They were essentially just light shows.

To make it even stranger, the information about the exhibits was written in tiny font, in the dark and it was hard to find them, which made it even harder to understand how they related to science.

So very disappointed. I rarely write reviews but this was so poor."
,,Great with kids,5.0,,"Visited here on our recent holiday, taking our three year son for a visit.

The thing that really struck me was just how interactive and fun this was for kids. Whether it was watching their colouring come to life on the giant screens, the wonderful ‘active’ slide or the giant inflatable balls that changed colour every time you touched them it was an absolute joy for the kids.

Well worth a visit, especially as it is so well placed in the bay."
,,Future World - not worth it,1.0,,"First of all, the queue is rather long at ticketing and the line moves terribly slowly. Perhaps the ticketing staff were slow. The entrance fee was SG 19.00 per adult, and we were expecting to see some good stuff. But the exhibition was really small and just a few things to see, mostly for young kids, the highlight being the crsytal lights which was just a walk through a very short passage and that's it. Very disappointing; SG19 is a rip off, in my opinion and Future World is highly uninteresting if you do not have kids to go with."
,,A must see,5.0,,A great Museum with modern exhibits a must see. I was amazed at the sophistication. Amazing. Kids loved it too!
,,Amazing Modern Art,4.0,,I want to go here for quite sometimes. I am very impressed with their Future World exhibition. Nature & Space with its famous Crystal Universe is my favorite! It is worth to see.
,,Amazing Exhibition,5.0,,"When I was there, me with 3 of family member buy 2 exhibition tickets, one for the future art and the other for the British Museum. Both are great. future art use light and animation and I really enjoy the experience. The british museum shows their collections of many things, like animals, crustaceans, cat mummy, etc and it's very amusing and educating.
very recommend. Make sure to check heir exhibitions date before going there on their website because the exhibitions are always changing."
,,Amazing architecture - exhibits did live up to the building,4.0,,"This structure is absolutely amazing. Designed to look like a lotus flower and the outside building is a unique shape on any skyline photo looking towards the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Each petal of the flower is curved up and has a skylight at the top. We decided to go in and try the exhibits. When we were there, only a few exhibits were open and all were in the lower level below grade. Most are geared toward kids and a well designed. Our party was all adults however so we just looked and enjoyed the wave exhibit, the waterfall (digital) and then the star field.
We really had hoped to see the inside of the unique structure above, but all galleries up there closed. It would have been nice to see them even if there wasn't an exhibit. We were underwhelmed overall with the interior exhibits, but the kids looked to be having a great time! In one area, kids could draw a fish or seahorse, and scan it into the computer. It would then be projected on the wall and swim in an ocean scene. Very cool - we even tried one. The next time we go to Singapore, I hope we will see the interior of the upper lotus flower sections. The outdoor reflecting pool was also cool."
,,"Check out What's On before you go, and enjoy!",5.0,,"This is a fascinating building to view - from the outside - and a trip to the vicinity is well worth it. We spent a while photographing the gorgeous tropical waterlilies, the building itself and the views from outside before entering.
As exhibitions vary you may want to check out what's on before deciding whether to pay to see the exhibits inside. Regardless of this the gift shop can be accessed free of charge and has an array of items that fit the Art - Science theme as well as a few for general tourists.
We were lucky enough to see 'NASA - A human adventure' and 'Journey to Infinity: Escher's World of Wonder' which we thoroughly enjoyed.
If you have children then the permanent 'Future World' exhibit will appeal to them (and the child inside you too).
We will be sure to visit the ArtScience Museum again on our next Singapore trip."
,,Future World,5.0,,Took my wife and kids (6 & 7 year olds). Fantastic place for them. Kids had a blast in all the rooms and wife could not stop talking pictures.
,,Great attraction for art lovers,5.0,,It's the prefect place to visit if you're someone who appreciates art or if you're interested in art. It's also a great place to visit with your friends just to snap that pics you really needed for your instagram
,,Great experience,4.0,,"Love the concept of it. Impressive exhibitions. Quite a fun place for the children, teenagers and adult as well. Able to interact with the facilities and having lots of fun."
,,"Very expensive, very short, and for young children only",3.0,,"In addition, the main attraction, the lamps room with fiber optics and digital vision around the ground, is FREE on the food court (floor B1).Very expensive, very short, and for .young children only"
,,Nasa a human adventure,4.0,,"I came to this place when there was NASA-A Human Adventure held. Its a nice place with various events and the bulding is very unique, close to marina bay sands mall exit."
,,Great for smaller children,4.0,,Architecturally amazing building. Exhibits catered more so for kids which loved it. Great light displays and interactive displays.
,,Great Place for Kids,4.0,,The ArtScience Museum is a great place for kids to witness some exciting stuff and get educated along. Some of the installations ( specially the light ones) were really mesmerizing even for adults. It is definitely worth a visit.
,,Art science museum..,5.0,,Art science museum is located in singapore within the integrated resorts of the marina bay sands. No one will miss this location because of the peculiar shape of a an lotus flowers. It has got a permanent art science exhibition gallery but they will hair many touring exhibitions. We can see this place during the city tours once you take the marina bay sands route. The view from the skypark observatory is awesome making it a most sought location all over singapore
,,Waste of Energy,2.0,,"Visited this museum with my husband expecting an interesting array of exhibits and while there were a handful of exhibits, they catered to young children or instagram (aspiring) personalities. We were really interested in the light exhibit but couldn’t even appreciate the art and story behind of it due to the massive lines of people trying to get the perfect picture for Instagram or their blogs. The museum served as a backdrop for folks photo shoot to the detriment of the art. Do yourselves a favor and skip."
,,Great for young children,5.0,,"We only went to the exhibition ""Future World"" and our daughter loved it. A really great entertainment and experience"
,,great place for your kids,5.0,,"the place is a mix of art and technology exhibit. our kids really enjoyed being there, despite the interior was a bit dark. the colorful image projected on the wall/screen, our kids were so excited when they know that their own drawing were shown on the big screen as soon as it had been scanned."
,,Totally worth an Experience,5.0,,Simply Loved the Future World where the light effects where simply crazy and interactive where as the Serendipity & Humans of the Future is not for all i guess ( its only who have interest in those topics can visit there ) but all these three Auditoriums were very interactive & Nice.. when in Singapore do visit this Place.
,,Style over substance,2.0,,"Brilliant building from the outside but way too esoteric and largely empty, maybe I just missed the point. There seemed to be a bit more on offer for pre-school children"
,,Interactive!,5.0,,"Wonderful building, impressive exhibitions, lots of thing to see and do (video art, design, science and technology) the museum is worth a visit for children, teenagers and grown ups."
,,IMO Not worth the money,1.0,,"I’m not sure if it was the timing we went or if it is usually like this all the time but really disappointed with this “museum”. When we arrived we were told there was only one exhibit so the entry was $17 (2 exhibits was $28). For the money you pay and what you get is not worth a visit in my opinion. Even with two exhibits it wouldn’t be worth the money. The future exhibit was more so for children but even as a child I don’t think it’s worth the time. So many more things to do and see in Singapore. We walked around the exhibit taking maybe 15-20 minutes at the most and when we left we were basically thinking “that’s it?! Where’s the rest of it?!”

We even went upstairs thinking there would be more, there HAS to be something else. We found emptiness and one room with a cartoon of animals projected onto the wall. So ya, that was it. If it was free maybe it wouldn’t of been so disappointing but to think we paid for it...really not sure why it is called a museum.

I would recommend checking out some of the other museums in Singapore if you want actually see something you would expect to see at a museum."
,,Very interactive!,5.0,,"Well, it seems that the museum is designed mainly for children, but I, as a teenager, still enjoy the wonders of the technology in the museum. The museum is very interactive with a fair amount of activities. For example, you can color a picture of a car and put it in a scanner. The large display on the wall will show your car moving in an imaginary city, with othes' car and houses as well. Kind of a hidden gem at Marina Bay."
,,disappointing,1.0,,went along with my son age 18 who is interested in science but we were really disappointed . the only exhibits available were only suitable for very young children
,,Lot of Fun !,5.0,,Loved the ArtScience Museum and I am not really into Science. It was really interactive. A lot of fun. Very Surreal and lots to do. Perfect for families. Though us two big kids had a ball! Could spend all day here. Also very close for high end shopping centre.
,,"it's a really good to see science lovers some show are eveining timings so, plan accordingly",5.0,,really nice too see science students / science lovers it's also have play area scientifically developed for kids/childs
,,Light-tastic! More enjoyable for kids!,3.0,,"After seeing this museum from the outside last year, I finally took the plunge and went to see the happenings of the inside.
When you walk through the doors, head for the elevator straight ahead or take the escalator on the left, that will take you B1. There isn't a huge sign, one on the side of the escalator but hard to miss because of the coffee shop. Also, the staff hanging around don't seem to want to help those who don't know.
However, that was just upstairs - the folks downstairs are nicer! :De

Come here and be overwhelmed with lights, everywhere. Even take some time and chill out on a beanbag to have a quick nap or update your friends. From there until the last light section is mainly for kids. There are lots of activities for them!

I was expecting something a little more, it's kinda boring if you aren't a kid. And the last sections with all the lights that change colour is the only appealing area. Maybe an update and making it more futuristic would be better."
,,Too expensive but amazing structure.,3.0,,Amazing structure however once inside you don't really feel the shape of the outside of the building. So much better from outside. Spend your time relaxing sitting around the lily ponds below the structure admiring the building and all around it. We took the lift to the top floor hoping there would be some sort of view of the building or a viewing platform but nothing. The box office and galleries are mostly on the lower levels as you enter. It is very expensive to enter any of the exhibitions so we did not bother at all. There was a free wildlife trail using hand held virtual reality screens that was fantastic. It is from WWF Singapore and was a great little wander around. There are so many more fun and interesting places to visit in Singapore than are just as good or better and definitely less expensive. Check what exhibitions are on before you go and how much it is to enter and then you can decide.
,,Unfortunately a bit of a wonder-bra of singapore. A big disapointment.,2.0,,"From the outside this place looks incredibly enticing, an unusual well designed shell. especially at night, wonderfully lit. Which although not normally my thing, intrigued me to go in later in the week. After paying just under $20 (please choose the red dot museum just down the road for under $3), found the museum confusing and badly laid out especially considered the lack of content in there. For young children ie 3-10 year olds they will enjoy it with all the lighting and play computer screens but didn't inspire me. My Singapore no.1 disapointment"
,,Awesome Visit,5.0,,"This is a Awesome visit for all ages, great place for families, as there is something here for every one there is spaces for children to play and explore, I found it amusing, in a good way, that just as many adults were playing as there were children, which is refreshing to see adults letting go and coming down to there children's level and enjoying the time together, and for the Geeks, like Me, there is a lot of interesting and hands-on exhibits geared for adults and children alike which is a tricky thing to do, and still have a fun learning experience. The gorgeous lotus shape of the building is eye catching in it self, simply Amazing"
,,Interactive museum mainly for children,4.0,,"If you are staying at Marina Bay Sands, make sure you sign up for their Sands Reward Lifestyle membership to receive a discount at the ArtScience Museum!!

The museum would appeal to more to children than to adults. For example, children can design/colour-in a car, scan and upload it and it will displayed on the museum's interactive wall. It could bring out the inner child within.

The light display at the end of the exhibition is mesmerising and very Instagram worthy (if that's what you're into)!"
,,Great place for children,3.0,,"The building is beautiful, shaped like a lotus, the exhibition on at the moment is very geared towards children. It's art in the form of digital technology and the images are beautiful. The main room is very child orientated with a slide, creating areas and lots of projected images. Perfect for children, not that great for adults visiting on their own, thought it was a bit expensive."
,,Must Visit,5.0,,There's always new exhibitions going on here which are very informative & interesting. You'll never be bored here.
,,Two rooms of kids tpys,1.0,,"If you are over the age of 4, do not bother. It is literally two rooms of kids toys for a whopping $17 per adult. Very poor."
,,Love visiting here,5.0,,Our family loves visiting the ArtScience museum. It's such a great building and so close to so many other attractions and the MRT station. It's one of my daughter's (aged 6 and 9) favourite places as their children's interactive exhibitions are fantastic. I highly recommend this to families.
,,Future World Good show.,4.0,,"I had a wonderful time at the Future World with my family. Interesting, interactive, fun, beautiful, artistic event. I would purely recommend ArtScience for this show.

Perhaps one thing to mention is that it's not fully a traditional museum you walk through but more like a gallery space with different exhibitions.

I also did the interactive walkthrough which broke down a lot, tech was... ok, perhaps good for children but even my kids broke. Good video though..."
,,Gorgeous building Interesting Exhibit,4.0,,I think the exhibits rotate so check the website for what id happening. We were able to see some video style exhibits that were truly amazing. Crow was my favorite. They give you a choice of how many exhibits you want to pay for so that was nice. I would say the price is expected. The facilities were clean and everyone was kind. It is a typical art museum with good exhibits.
,,Good to see it!,4.0,,Since you are in Singapore and you have time and money than is worth to have a visit where are interesting thinks to be see !
,,Not up to our expectations,2.0,,"Now this place looks amazing and it probably is if you have children and photo ID that isn't a passport.

We paid our entry fee and went in... the first room which was about lighting etc was nice especially the crystal room. The place is a hive of kids and they all looked like they were having a great time.

The second exhibit we were told we needed photo id and our passports were not good enough. This would of been lovely to know at the start since this would of stopped us going in.

Overall we were disappointed in coming here... not really suited for tourists who dont have children."
,,An Amazing Piece Of Architecture,3.0,,"After reading the reviews we decided not to go in to the museum, however the architecture of the building is amazing and striking."
,,Future World Exhibition with Children,5.0,,"My husband and I took our 9 month old baby to the Art Science Museum at MBS last Sunday and had an amazing time.

Upon entry we were asked if we would like to leave our stroller outside as there was stroller parking. We declined as we thought our little one may take a nap.

Once we entered we were ushered into a screening of Crows, a 3D projection mapping video of Crows in flight. Was nice to watch in a dark room. Even our 9 month old watched the entire thing which only lasted a few minutes.

Then we checked out a tidal waves projection. You can laze on the beanbags and watch it, take photos or just relax. Our baby kept going to the wall with the projection hoping to catch a wave.

Then came the fruit and flower field slide. This is a big hit for kids, as they get to slide down a giant slide with fruits and flowers projections. Many kids went on the slide again and again.

The entire exhibition used lighting technology and projection mapping. You can colour in images of sea animals, images of buildings etc and immediately get it projected on the floor, wall or ceilings. It's really fun. You get lots of colours and creativity from everyone.

There was an area which had LED cubed bricks to play with. Also another with LED Balls. My 9 month old baby was crawling everywhere and pulling herself up on the bricks and balls. She had such a good time.

The exhibit ends through a crystal universe which is really pretty and great for photos. You can't take a stroller through the crystal room though. Something to take note of if you plan to take your stroller into the exhibition. Although my recommendation is leave the stroller outside at stroller parking. This exhibition is highly entertaining and interactive. No kid or baby will want to be in the stroller through it. You will just end up lugging it everywhere.

An excellent exhibition to go with small children!"
,,"Future Human, Not what we expected",3.0,,"On reading about the exhibit my Husband was keen to go.

The future human exhibit wasn't all that good.. It was mostly art, less science. However it was airconditioned, and being the first day in Singapore again, it was nice.....

I would give other exhibits ago next time i am in Singapore, I wouldn't bother with the Future Human one again. I think it is advertised incorrectly."
,,Complete waste of money.,1.0,,"We were pretty excited to see this place after reading the reviews and seeing the incredible building it is located in, however after spending 40mins queuing to buy a ticket, what we actually witnessed was probably one of the worst ""museums"" I've ever witnessed.

There was an initial light show which was quite interesting, but after that, the place was just one big children's playground, with really nothing interesting to see as an adult couple. Most of the exhibits are just walls of light with no real explanation on what they are, and I'd say it's only of real interest to kids.

I'd could forgive all of the above with the understanding that the place is great for kids, but literally, after you've seen the 10 min light show, we had walked round and seen everything in less than 5 mins. A complete waste of time and the literally the worst $36 spent.

Unless you have kids, I wouldn't bother."
,,Great exhibition!,5.0,,We visited an amazing exhibition and the building is great! definitely worth a visit! it's also a great place to take pictures
,,Probably the best museum I’ve been to,5.0,,"On a really hot day I decided to keep myself in the air-con and visit the ArtScience Museum. They had a number of exhibitions on, some paid for and some which are free.

‘Future World’ I believe is a permanent fixture there. This is the one where they have more than 170,000 LED lights which create a crystal universe giving you an illusion of being in space. A big photo opportunity!

‘Human+ The Future of our Species’ is another one I paid to see and was worth the money. This goes through what it would mean to be a human in a world of robots, cyborgs and clones; as well as much more. They even have an AI robot, Nadine, who you can sit and have a conversation with. This exhibition is on until 15 October

‘Serpenti form art jewellery design’ – Something to do with snakes and jewellery! I didn’t do this one.

‘Into the Wild’ – This is a free one and good for both adults and children. You can get a VR headset which will guide you through the museum and get you to do a few fun things. There’s also a short film to watch at the final place it takes you to.

My ticket for 2 exhibitions (Future World and Human+) cost $28 (around £15).

Aside from the museum you also have Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands and the Mall, to name a few, all within a couple of minutes’ walk away."
,,A dream come true,5.0,,I've always wanted to experience future World expedition and finally I did! It did not disappoint it was amazing how they do things. Recommend for all ages as there is interactive areas for children and adults to have fun!!
,,Back to the Future,5.0,,"We were limited for time so only did the main exhibition (permanent one). The whole exhibition explores futuristic ideas and technologies. From videos to light trails, as the kids go down a slide, and from large balls of changing light to your colouring brought to life, on the floor of walls, ( and other activities as well)it was just an awesome, hands on exhibition. We were able to purchase Seniors tickets at this venue."
,,Last day in Singapore,5.0,,"What a wonderful experience to see the last days of our holidays. A fantastic array of artwork, jewellery, and costumes from around the world. The colours and textures on the designs were fantastic, and what a great location to have the examples of great woks. Thanks was a wonderful last day. Such a beautiful abstract using to convey the message of Art and Science"
,,"Creative, pondering, wondering...",5.0,,"We came to this museum during a rainy day and it was the best decision ever. The topic of the futuristic world and humanity is very nice represented. I also can recommend the virtual reality experience they offer there; we also visited the current exhibition from Bulgari about snaky inspiration, very nice one! Even the building looks very impressive, spectacular, the architecture is amazing (the flower's shape in white) You can go with your kids to the museum, there are different interactive games in the future world part. We spent in the museum about 2:45h. If you are Marina Bay Sands customer, bring your key with you and you will get a discount."
,,Childish,3.0,,"We had a very poor introduction to purchasing tickets for the Art Science Museum.
As a Sands Reward Club member, I am entitled to receive a free adult ticket for every adult ticket purchased, up to two every month.
On Fridays, up to four children are entitled to enter the Museum free of charge for every adult ticket purchased. The staff were obstinate that I couldn't receive the free tickets for my two children. This is despite that there is no term or condition that prevents this. They stated that it would be combining offers or promotions. Yet this is something that surely would have been contemplated and explicitly excluded, but is definitely not. Maybe I am the first person to do this. They argued back and forwards, but refused to have a senior manager come speak to me. Its a Singaporean thing!

However, the shnorrer in me was not going to back down.

Eventually a manager did come after an hour. I had one question for her; what is the cost of an ""All Access"" adult ticket on Fridays with the free children's tickets when paying with my NETS card? the answer was SGD$38.00 less 15% equals SGD$32.30. You see, in September there was a special of 15% discount with the NETS card.

Ah Ha! I had them and they knew the game was up. This is because it would be combining offers or promotions which they had wrongly and incessantly argued.

We went to all the exhibitions and completed the tour in a little over two hours.
Great for children, not too long or in depth. They weren't bored at all.
Very poor value if you pay the normal price.
Luckily my persistence payed off by saving SGD$90.00"
,,Full of wonders and visual delights!,5.0,,Excellent place to feast your eyes on and take lots of wonderful photos. Excellent for both adults and kids.
,,Over-priced and underwhelming,3.0,,"It looks interesting from afar, but inside a different story. Expensive entry (if you are a tourist). One permanent display -- which is meant to typify art/science: it is kind of cool on a first visit, but you wouldn't want to return... especially given the hoards of local school kids who turn the place into bedlam (obviously, they don't pay the tourist entry fee!). The two visiting shows vary over time... when we went, one was trite, the other ho-hum. Maybe you'll catch something better. Avoid weekends: Singaporeans for some obscure reason flock to the place."
,,There is loads of interesting things to see,5.0,,"The exhibitions were very interesting and it’s one of the best museums in the world. Every year there is something different, which keeps you very interested."
,,Fantastic. They really know how to put on an exhibition,5.0,,Spent a wonderful 3 hours here on my recent trip. Paid for all three exhibitions that were on & given a good price. Make this a must go.
,,Will come back,4.0,,"I gotta say, coming here alone made me a little sad because the exhibitions are amazing and I wish I could’ve taken a photo of someone at some of the installations."
,,Whole family loved Future exhibition,5.0,,Visited last week with two teens aged 15 and 16. We all had a great time visiting the Future exhibition. We also saw the Human exhibition but found that bit dull and so should have not bothered with that ticket. The free Wild exhibition was good too.
,,Visit with 2 kids,4.0,,"I went for the ""Into the Wild"" exhibit where the kids are required to use a tablet or a small phone to manouvre around the exhibits even ti level for. great for educating children about the wild and saving nature despite living in the technological world.This exhibit was free though. There are other exhibits that requires you to purchase tickets."
,,Making education fun,5.0,,There is always something of interest happening here. Geared for children and adults you can do the free stuff or pay for bigger exhibits. A good place to chill after the hectic shops.
,,good for kids,4.0,,"future world is really nice for kids learning. there was another free show for wild animals etc, but looks like they have limited tokens and we were asked to wait for an hour if we wanted to see, although this being a weekday it wasnt much crowded.
maybe skipped if other things are planned out."
,,Future World is Incredible,5.0,,Wow! This is the most fun my family and I have had at a museum. We spent a whole afternoon creating and being totally mesmerized by their exhibits. Highly highly recommended to visit. I will definitely be back if I get the chance again. Be prepared to have your mind blown by art and science.
,,My favourite museum,5.0,,"Interactive, modern, cool...a great fun and educative place for children and adults. Some very cool technology."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"Come and join in some of the activities, it is an amazing museum at Marina Bay Sands, not to be missed for sure!"
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"Went into two exhibitions both really well done, one was art & science in the future which was great fun, but the future and robotics was quite gruesome. Not for the squeamish. Didn't have time to visit the rest of the museum."
,,Favorite Spot,5.0,,One of my favorite destinations in Singapore. Every time I visit this county I'll make sure I'll visit the museum to see the latest events and displays. A must for the creative and curious mind as well as for the avid art lover
,,For the Contemporary Art lovers.,4.0,,"I decided to visit this museum 'cause I have a free day in Singapore. I registered for the Sands rewards card so I can get a discounted tickets for the exhibits I want to see. (Registration is free.)

HUMAN+ is quite interesting but its presentation can be improved. This exhibit will really make you think of the advances in humans through technology. And some to disturbing extent.

Future World is enjoyable especially with kids (and adults alike) because of the various lights and LED displays. It's quite small and can be crowded during late afternoon, so plan your visit time."
,,Serpentine,4.0,,"A spectacular venue! Wonderfully, yet surprisingly, laid out for a pleasant and streamlined visit. Well worth visiting."
,,Future works with some other exhibits,4.0,,Visited the art science museum and at first was a little under whelmed by the moving art which appeared to have been very engaging with the kids. The light column was great though. The highlight of the the museum is future works with the innovation and great informative pieces. The Bvlgari exhibit was good but nothing that cannot be seen elsewhere
,,Awesome Future World for one time visit,4.0,,"we only entered the FutureWorld. it's so cool where you get to enjoy the arts and technology at the same time. you get to do the slide, color your creations and it will stay on the wall screen where everyone can see it. play with the big balls where it changes color every time you bounce it to the floor."
,,Future fantastic,5.0,,"Future world was amazing for young kids. So much to do, the animating the drawings being a big hit. Get a free membership to the marina bay sands club (you can sign up online) and save on membership."
,,FutureWorld is Great but not so for HUMAN+,4.0,,"I'm reviewing our ArtScience Museum experience for 2 exhibits: FutureWorld and HUMAN+. We actually wanted to go for the free exhibit, Into The Wild, but sadly it was closed for renovation when we were there. I would say that FutureWorld is really good fun, not just for kids but adults as well. Besides the slide (which is awesome fun), there are many interactive activities whereby anyone can have fun, such as an animation game on a table, colouring in your creations to have them show up on the screen, placing blocks on a table and watch how it affects the city, etc. There are beautiful blocks that are lighted up in different colours, which are great for phototaking.
Both my hubby and I were utterly disappointed with HUMAN+, as the content shown was not what we have expected, and somehow the presentation was dull and boring. In effect, it took us less than an hour to finish appreciating the entire HUMAN+ exhibition, and it's not cheap too.
Overall, FutureWorld is worth a visit but I wouldn't say the same for HUMAN+."
,,nice but bad organization,3.0,,"right on Marina Bay
the building is so nice and one of the icon of the Bay
in fact there is 3 majors expo
one per floor
but you need to purchase one ticket per attraction
it s a really interactive museum
good for all the family
little bit expensive for a big family"
,,worth visit if only for the building,5.0,,paid for all 3 zones and was worth the time to visit all and take time to wander through it all. dont bother with mall next door.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Visited the Futureworld exhibit and loved it. It's not a museum in the traditional sense, but as an adult, go ready to play and it's a brilliant experience."
,,Future World - Where Art Meets Science,5.0,,"This exciting exhibition at the visually beautiful ArtScience Museum is designed for children and the young-at-heart. It presents a range of interactive experiences in which children of all ages can participate - from a large (not high) slide (Sliding through the fruit field), to playing with large interior-lit blocks (Media Block Chair) and large balls (Light Ball Orchestra), to other explorations with light, sound and shape. My grandchildren found 'Sketch Town' the most engrossing activity as they could draw or colour in trucks or planes or other shapes, pass them through a colour copier/computer which then incorporate their image into Sketch Town. It was very exciting for them to see their drawings as part of the activity on the large screen. I found the 'Crystal Universe' a spectacular finale to my visit to the exhibition. Thank you ArtScience Museum and Teamlab for this exciting exhibition."
,,Not to our Expectations,2.0,,"We paid for 2 Exhibitions - FutureWorld and HUMAN+. FutureWorld is a disappointment as it is not an exhibition as such but a playground for children. The only thing worth seeing is the Crystal Universe. We were in and out of FutureWorld in 10 minutes!!
We expected to see more information and exhibits on what is perceived of the future of humans with the advancement of Science and Technology in the HUMAN+."
,,Not to be missed activity based museum!,5.0,,"The architecture from afar is like a palm which have meaning in fengshui.

That aside coming marina bay sands you can easily locate the museum. You can combine this visit with gardens by the bay since it is nearby.

We visited the future world exhibit and I am
full of praise. One can easily spend 3-5 hours here with kids interacting with the various exhibits or sitting around chilling at the quieter sections. However 2 hours should suffice as well for couples.

My kids had great fun doing colouring and watching their creation come to life on the moving screen. Even I had to join in the fun when I realised the colouring section was a giant 3D printer!

Buy tickets online to avoid queues. Bring enough bottled water."
,,Future World - recommended for kids and kids-at-heart,5.0,,Only got to check out the Future World exhibit and I'm beyond satisfied. The installations were very interactive and intuitive! Checked out the pictures on Instagram and only expected a couple of cool installations - to my surprise there were a lot more! There were quite a number of people when I went and there was still ample space for everyone. Staff was also very helpful when needed. Kids and kids-at-heart would definitely enjoy this. A great plus would be how this museum is located right by Marina Bay Sands - one can enjoy the panoramic views of the city right before entering/leaving the museum.
,,Great for all ages.,5.0,,The interactive exhibits are sensational. It is never too crowded and I saw lots of families there making it a truly educational experience.
,,Future World-Where Art Meets Science,5.0,,Incredible experience. The lights and glitz exhibitions were amazing. My children and I had greatest fun at the the interactive art booths. Our art works were digitally mapped and projected on a large screen alongside with other creations. Further it could be made into a 3-D object. It was a fun way to spend an afternoon indoors especially admist the hot and blazing Singapore climate.
,,expensive!,2.0,,we visited the Human exhibition and unfortunately many of the interactive exhibits were not working also nobody informed us that the interactive robot is only in operation between 4 and 6pm which would have made a difference to when we visited. All in all we felt it was a waste of money. The building however is beautiful and we would have been better to just walk around the outside.
,,Excellent place to hangout with kids!,5.0,,"We visited there not expecting much and was much surprised to see the place is fun of fun! We took the FutureWorld attraction and had a good time. Our 6 and 9 years kids loved the many interactive and colorful games / attractions in the FutureWorld. The place is very cool and you can have your own time in the semi lit environment with so many things to do.

Families with young children, this is must visit place in Singapore!"
,,ArtScience Museum,5.0,,"Definitely worth paying a visit. You, family and friends will mesmerized by all the exhibits. It will also be an educational visit if you bring children along."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"Exceptional architecture of the building: a lotus on the see. Well done digital experience ""Into the wild"", preferably with kids. Impressive ""human +"" exhibition."
,,Excellent place for kids!,5.0,,"I brought my 2 girls aged 6 and 8 during teacher day. We stayed there almost the entire day ( reach there before 11 and went off about 6 plus). They had truely enjoyed themselves there.

I bought the accesses for all 3 exhibits - future world, serpentiform and human +. On the himdsight, for them, I should have just bought the future world only. I dont think it is a place for adults especially if you go without any kids. Future world will be more for kids. adults can however explore other exhibits instead.

As this is kind of the first time we visited such place, they were truely amazed. We did not go to MOSH! before hence they went there without expectation. when they first inside, they thought there are just relaxing with the waves. But they gotten excited when the saw the slides and the interactive town.

That was not all! They saw people colouring and wanted to colour instead. and the surprize came after they scannes their pictures and send them to the floor. they were a bit difficult to find them though.

The highlight is the sketch town which they colour and scan them. They could find their truck and car on screen. They had great fun hunting and moving with their car. The other highlight for them is the scanning into 3D craft. They spent sometime doing the craft there but really enjoyed themselves and they wanted to do more. The disappointing part is that the 3d craft is only for the sketch town picture but not under water world and nature theme. But sketch town has quite a lot of pictures to draw and scan already!

For the colourful big balls, safety aspects can probably be improved. My girls were complaining about people knocking them etc but I will take it that they will need to take care of themselves more and be careful when playing.

The hopscotch was intially not a fan for them but after another round.. they were excited to created it. But so much in jumping but to have their names appeared on the wall.

Space was another area which they liked. But there was only 1 terminal and my hp batt was running low. there were other people/ adults hogging on the terminal which did not give them the chance to create their universe.

Human + was disappointing (except for talking to the robot) but they did have so fun in the serperntiform when they were haunting for the snake with ipad and creating a snake for them to control or dance.

Overall great place for kids and if going with kids, just go for future world will do. The 'fun' in other exhibits did not justify the cost.

Enjoyed!"
,,Smaller than it looks,4.0,,Architecturally amazing but a tiny bit disappointing inside. Made up of only 4 floors with only two free to visit levels our visit was brief. The interactive exhibit was fun but obviously targeted at all ages so we felt a little juvenile. The two other floors exhibits looked great but like everything in Singapore it is pricey so we decided to skip and walk over the bridge nearby instead.
,,Amazing no ordinary art experience,5.0,,I took my 8 year old son to the Future worlds exhibition and we both had a ball. So much beauty created from light and sound shows..great interactive art displays...best thing we did in Singapore. Great to do during the heat of the day so you are in a cool environment. Close to marina Bay Sands so we had lunch at the food hall there.
,,Great Museum,4.0,,My daughter enjoyed herself there. The future world exhibit was good and very interactive. Very educative even for adults
,,Amazing !!,5.0,,"A tip for every budget traveller, just head into any of the info counters in MBS and ask them how do you sign up for marina bay sands reward card as you get to enjoy BUY 1 FREE 1 tickets for art science musuem! It took us around 5-10 minutes to complete the registration... fyi, remember to bring your passport along with you.

THe Future world exhibition was incredible.. the LED installations and projections were just amazing!! There are a couple of sections dedicated for kids... eg: drawing/building blocks/bouncing balls and what not.
It's a great place to spend time with ur kids."
,,"Clever, fun and interactive",5.0,,The building itself and the surroundings are amazing. The exhibits that were on when we visited were very interesting. My daughter and I swapped bodies in a virtual reality exhibit. We couloured fish which were then scanned and were immediately shown on an underwater moving screen. A must visit.
,,My wife loved it,4.0,,"I am not a big museum fan. Also, the exhibits they had on, when we visited were about Darwin. I did enjoy the ambiance inside. Although, I did get bored after a while. There are a lot of good photo opportunities. My wife loved it though, there was so for hear to see and learn. She was busy for a couple of hours reading along the inscriptions."
,,Absolutely great for the kids. The top of our list.,5.0,,"We visited as a family of 4 with my 3 grandchildren, ages 3, 7 and 9. Went to the interactive Future World exhibit and they were all enthralled with the overall exhibit."
,,Museum trip,4.0,,"Modern artistic building housing various displays from time to time , check out what's on . It's sited near the Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino and is reachable by taxi or the MRT."
,,Ignite the Imagination at this fantastic place,5.0,,"We visited the museum as a family of four, with 2 teenage kids. The very name was an attraction to us as our daughter wrestles with her competing interests in science and the arts. The building's architecture is beautiful and calls you to it! What a fantastic place this is for anyone, those with a keen eye to what awaits human in coming years and decades as much as those who're in there for some fun and learn session.

I had lost my phone in our Uber ride just as we arrived at ArtScience Museum. So you can imagine how wonderful this place ought to be that it was able to inform and absorb the attention of tourists who otherwise were rather distressed. I recommend strongly this place for all who are in Singapore. I have not seen a museum of this quality that brings human ingenuity and progress they way this one does, playfully and interestingly.

We say the Future world and Human+ exhibits and came out intrigued with charged neurons to ask more questions and seek. This visit informed a college bound teenager's worldview of what she seeks is not new, and very mush in her grasp. For parents it was reassuring to see human progress when so much mayhem abounds on news these days.

Do visit, with an open mind and eager eyes/ears. You will not be disappointed if you give this place the time it deserves. We spend 4 hours here that included a fire drill! If we every return to Singapore, which we all hope earnestly, ArtScience will be on top of our list."
,,great fun for kids but some things were a little weird,4.0,,"Took my brothers kids for a day out and they loved it similar to the science museum in London it is very interactive and visual. With many installations to see and explore though it was fun I did come out feeling I didn't learn anything about stuff or the science behind the installations.

It's great fun for the kids and that the most important but felt it was lacking something."
,,"Always interesting, changes regularly",5.0,,"Art Science Museum is a favorite for our family. The exhibitions change regularly and the management cater well in school holidays. We have seen some amazing things here like the Dali Exhibition (unforgettable) the Warhol Exhibition (also unforgettable) and other exhibitions including space, colour, music and one memorable one of Impressionists using the whole walls as screens and projecting images. Definitely check to see whats on., Good coffee shop in the lobby too"
,,Excellent Museum!,5.0,,"This is the second time I've been to this Museum. Lots of interactive activities, and very informative, with mixed media learnings. Great place to get out of the Singapore heat and humidity with an excellent location."
,,ArtScience Museum,4.0,,"A great all round experience, interactive with advanced technology and information. Each floor is more or less a different exhibit so it's easy to navigate around and see everything. In the main central area so easy to get to for tourists"
,,Artscience museum is the unique flower petal shaped building in all the pics,5.0,,"My Fiancee discovered this museum during our trip to Singapore because from the viewing deck of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, from the Merlion in the plaza, it's the flower shaped building that is entirely unique. So one day we described it to our taxi driver, and after a few moments he knew what we were talking about and dropped us of near the museum. You will have to walk a fair distance through a building and a plaza to get to it's entrance, but it shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes depending on your walking speed. We purchased tickets inside, but the best deals we heard were from a City-Wide ticket tour package that you can buy at the municipal government building and online too. The museum had a lot of interesting exhibits you could walk through. The best activities though were an interactive area where you, and/or your children could draw vehicles on paper, then a machine would scan them and they would join all of the other vehicles motoring around on a giant projection of a cartoon city. It was fun looking for your own creation. There were several other interactive exhibits like that as well.

I'm sure those exhibits are gone, and new ones are in their places, but this attraction would be good for families to visit with their children"
,,Fun for the kids,4.0,,It you are out with 5 kids and want to keep the captivated and busy for 3/4 hours then this is he place to be! Lots of interactive activities and the adults also seem to get to join in as well
,,Cool,4.0,,"The exhibits change a lot so any review is going to depend on when you go. The two I saw were into the future and human+. First the building is great, rally fascinating. It's part of the whole MBS area so close to shops, expensive designer shops, and also the gardens by the bay. So a visit here could be part of a whole day by the bay. The cafe in the foyer is a bit average but the entire visit was interesting. I wasn't that impressed with Human+ I wanted more robots! Parts were interesting, some of the interactive stuff is restricted to certain times in the day too. Into the future would be great for a visit with kids the last exhibit had the wow factor."
,,Surprise,4.0,,"Not a big museum, but an interesting one. They keep changing the exhibition and always try to provide people with some new experience. In this visit, they use high tech and interactive method to show case the future world. Children really enjoy it."
,,Great indoor activities for children,5.0,,"Visited the Future World exhibition with 10-year old. We stayed for almost 3 hours and he was fully immersed in the participative exhibits, starting from the slide. Totally worth the tickets."
,,Great museum,5.0,,"Of course it is dependent on the current exhibition BUT the building on its own is worth visiting. The exhibition I saw was wonderful, very unique in design and spectacular. I would be happy to return here."
,,Future World Exhibition is awesome!,4.0,,"I went there with my friends, I expected a huge museum and might take a long time to stay in there. No, it is very small with just 4 parts of the exhibitions. (Future World)

BUT WE NEVER WANT TO LEAVE THERE! the exhibition had many interesting stuff to do. It can make you feel calm, energetic, relax and ambitious at the same time.

I can spend my whole day watching the lights in Space part."
,,A must-see for your children,5.0,,"During the summer there are always good exhibitions and shows for children, things that your family can spend whole day to see, play and enjoy. Good chance for your children to be more creative and get inspired."
,,Fascinating and very innovative,5.0,,"Near the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, this museum has been established to explore the connections between art & science and stages various exhibitions to take visitors on a journey through these realms.
In the Future World exhibition there were a number of interactive art works with some of the installations more directed towards children. Divided up into four themed rooms, Sketch Town Paper Craft was particularly interesting where a virtual town is built and populated with drawings by visitors. It’s fun to scan your coloured drawings and then see them become a part of the virtual town which is projected onto a wall with everything in motion. The final highlight of this exhibition was a depiction of astronomical space through the installation Crystal Universe. Visitors have a passage to walk between the long threads of multi-coloured LED lights, which are programmed to change colour and form various patterns. A spectacular finale to this permanent exhibition.

We then visited Human+ - The Future of our Species, which set out to explore the possible future paths of our species. With installations focusing on artificial intelligence, lifelike robots and genetic modification, it was very cleverly designed and thought provoking.
Good place to go on a wet afternoon as we did."
,,Unique art & science experience,4.0,,We especially like the Sketch Town where the kids can draw their pictures to be scanned and then uploaded into big screen. Your work of art will then travel around with other pieces to form a busy transportation town. Amazing. We also like the Crystal Universe with its lighting effects. Good place for kids and parents to spend time with activities.
,,Dissapointing,2.0,,"I bought an all pass for two paid exhibition there, human+ was unbearable and future light(cant remember exactly) are more suitable as kid playground . Probably the worst museum experience i have had in singapore by far. The entrance fee was 28ish dollar. And not worth the money at all."
,,I liked it,4.0,,I didn't visit the exhibitions as I understand it's more for children the adults but I came to see a free Gibli stufio movie. It was great! Also the have a free good WiFi. There is a nice cafe at the lobby with a bit expensive prices bit it's normal for a place like that. They close at 7 a.m. The staff is very nice
,,EYE OPENING MUSEUM,5.0,,"Before you go, make sure that you are a playful person. Most of the things inside are suitable for kids to have fun with. A lot of stuff which is related to science and art yet fun to play with."
,,Something for everyone,4.0,,The museum truly brings together art and science in a way that engages the visitor. There were three exhibitions that provide variety for different age groups and visitors. We had an 8 year old in the group this time and visited the interactive exhibition. The family considered it one of the high points of our time in Singapore. Highly recommend.
,,Pretty cool place for kids - interactive,5.0,,"Pleasant surprise. Didn't know what to expect as my tickets came with the room at MBS. Best to describe it as hands on and interactive with technology. Best for kids <10. There is alot of cool visuals, a short movie, a lounge room where you can stare at visuals. Interactive exhibits where you can draw things and have them appear in a virtual world. Good for 1+ hours"
,,Love!!!,5.0,,"We love coming here.

Each time there is a new exhibition and they are soo interesting and each time we have gone there has been 1 interactive for the children.

When buying a pass ask if the others are suitable for young children as we wasted money on buying a multi pass and the others were not suitable (we actually had to walk out) with it this time but last time they were!

We could have spent an entire day here! I had fun! Also and I learned so much as well.

A great place for anyone of any age!"
,,Excellent exhibitions,4.0,,Wonderful new architectural building with great science exhibitions esp the new interactive series on species loss
,,Favorite museum - go to Future World and Into the Wild,5.0,,"From the name itself, the exhibits center on how art, science, and tech collide. Pretty much captures SG’s emphasis on the beauty of nature and our role in it. The third part of Future World is the best, and most kid-friendly because it's super interactive. MUST TRY Into the Wild - the free exhibit for WWF, it uses Augmented REality to encourage saving endangered species."
,,Amazing expos,5.0,,"Went with my 7 yrs old daughter to see Future World and we both were amazed by it. We loved this museum and even though I was a bit worried that my daughter may find it boring, she didn't at all!"
,,"Good outside,average inside",3.0,,From outside the building is amazing. Inside is not too interesting.we saw the future world exibition.it was good but not something to remember long time. To go there take the mrt to bayfront station and there are signs which lead you.
,,Interesting,4.0,,I saw a couple of exhibitions there of excellent quality. Too bad the permanent exhibition was under maintenence.
,,Very engaging,5.0,,"We had an enjoyable afternoon at the ArtScience Museum. First we went to the Team-lab light and sound interactive installation, which was mostly for children but so much fun. Main problem was in the room with the universe depicted by mirrors and many lights where large numbers of people were taking selfies and staged phitos, making it difficult to move, see and enjoy the experience. Upstairs we went to the astronomy through art exhibition which was not crowded and contained some amazing original books (Copernicus, Galileo) and artworks."
,,More fun than expected,4.0,,"The museum has several separate exhibits, you can get access to one, two or all.
We got access to the Future World. It was all about light technology with all the exhibits being interactive.
What they don't tell you is that it is 100% kids oriented.
The adults in our group had lots of fun too, basically being kids in each activity and experimenting with the technology; but a couple of people said they would have gone to a different exhibit had they known it was all kids targeted.
Also, if you sign up (free) for a Sands Rewards Membership, you get one free adult ticket for every one paid for.
Kids get in for free in Fridays."
,,Not sure what to think,3.0,,"Tip: If you sign up for the Sands Hotel program (Free) you get a free ticket per accoiunt to this museum.
Its a museum where art meets science and it is more of a kids museum than for adults. It is fun if you are 7, and just noisey as heck if you are over 30. But, it is a good rainy day activity"
,,A great day out,5.0,,This museum has something for everyone - and the Future World has enough to keep kids and kids-at-heart busy for hours.
,,Exploration of art and science is so interesting and full of satisfaction!,4.0,,"Simply love the ArtScience Museum located at the beautiful waterfront promenade which is so easily accessible. I also came to look at the lovely lotus in the Lotus Pond just outside this unique building shaped like a gigantic lotus.

I was there for the creative exhibition – Future World where Art meets Science! Love the Crystal Universe exhibition the most. Amazing and magical. Reminding us the constantly evolving environments which is the true nature of this world and our own inner world - I think we can welcome the interactive state of evolution. Hence, enter and explore the beauty.

I like that the exhibitions also crater to the young ones, a special platform to educate them to see the world deeply and in new fresh perspectives.

Exploration of art and science is so interesting and full of satisfaction!"
,,The FutureWorld exhibition is fabulous... not so sure about the other exhibits,4.0,,"I've been to the FutureWorld exhibit twice with 2 different friends, and have had a fantastic time on both occasions. They change the exhibit slightly over time, so that your experience can be new when you go a second time. It is a really hands on interactive exhibit, you can relax on a beanbag whilst walls display beautiful images, you can colour in drawings of animals/vehicles which you then scan in and see come alive on the floor and walls, you can have flowers grow at your feet where you stand, you can go down a slide that make sounds and colours as you slide down it, you can turn you coloured in drawing into a 3D model, you can play with giant inflatable balls that change colours and make sounds, you can make your own hopscotch that you can then play, it's an immersive light and sound exhibition... we loved it, and we're grown ups, so I can't even imagine how exciting children must find this FutureWorld exhibit, definitely worth the admission fee. It's not for everyone, but if you have a playful childlike side to your personality then I would imagine you will love it.

However, I can't be as passionately excited about the Human+ or the Universe & Art exhibitions... perhaps it is just because they are not to my taste/interests. I found the Human+ exhibition very weird and odd, although some bits were interesting, other bits were kinda depressing or a little gruesome/morbid, the best part would be the realistic robot at the end who you can talk to and have a conversation with, my parents enjoyed this exhibition more than I did, so it might just not be suited to me. The Universe and Art exhibit wasn't really found interesting by myself or my parents, we just didn't really like it to be honest, the art was not at all to my taste, there was a video of dancing/floating in zero gravity, that is the thing I remember the most, and I wasn't particular fussed by seeing that."
,,Always has good exhibitions on,5.0,,"Exhibitions inside didn't disappoint, make sure you go early or book your ticket online as there may be a bit of a queue for the ticket booth"
,,Excellent selection of exhibits,5.0,,"We were unsure what to expect from the Artscience Museum but enjoyed it immensely. The interactive Future World exhibit is brilliant for kids young and old - ours are aged 12 and 9 and we had to drag them away. Similarly, the Human+ exhibit has some fascinating robot- and cyborg-related items on display. If you (or more importantly the children) are tiring or if you're a bit short on time, the third main exhibit - the Universe and Art - is arguably the least interesting to the kids but there is plenty to keep the grown-ups absorbed."
,,A mixed bag,4.0,,"We visited today as part of a visit to the Marina Bay area and on a 7 day visit to Singapore as a whole. I knew from researching it before that we would have to pay a lot to see all exhibits so we had provisionally decided to see just one or two. We opted in the end for HUMAN+ and Future World. As we are non-locals we paid a high price but decided we had no choice so went ahead. We did the HUMAN+ first and both agreed we really enjoyed it. It's a good size for the ticket price and has some very interesting concepts and features and a good mix of medium - audio clips, feature films, interactive displays etc. I particularly enjoyed the part with the so-called 'designer human' babies. I didn't like at all the second exhibition which I really think should be sold only to families. Large parts of it - all in fact - rely on image projection, mostly highly coloured and backed by dramatic music. The music isn't loud enough to drown out the crowds of screaming children, sadly, who run uncontrollably between the spaces. It's nice that they have something so interactive for children and families but I would really suggest the museum sell it as this and only as this. The another annoying thing about this is a wider complaint of Singapore as a whole. Whilst I understand that the artists work is meant to be appreciated and not photographed, the culture of the country seems to be geared to the mindset of a never-ending selfie or social media update: a shameless vanity project which ruins all attempts at culture or artistic endeavour. Not only are you unavoidably forever featuring in these selfies yourself, which isn't something I particularly like the idea of, but you're constantly having to ask people to move whilst they take endless photos and video footage - most of which looks terrible anyway given the low lighting - which distracts from the personal experience. Obviously museums can't stop this and to have 'no cell phone' or 'no photography' signs wouldn't work as they ignore them anyway - several girls asked (as everyone is on entering the final LED light feature) not to touch the lights, were holding on to them whilst their friends looked on laughing and taking their never-ceasing inane photos. I'm ranting like an old man now so I'll stop. But maybe it's worth anyone reading this planning an early visit before the crowds build if you want to avoid this. All in all, I really enjoyed my visit but did feel it was overpriced. However, I would come again. The building itself is an architectural masterpiece in and of itself - and I laud anyone still producing work like this well into their eighth decade. So kudos to Moshe Safdie. It's just a shame that people can't be more respectable."
,,Not really,3.0,,"Personally, I found this heavy going – there were three separate exhibitions with the facility to purchase tickets separately or choose a combo of more than one – as we only had a relatively short amount of time to spend here we asked the ticket clerk to recommend to us – Future World our first choice was busy with a school group – so she suggested Universe and Art – no a good choice I am afraid as I found it bordering on dull. There was an additional ‘free’ exhibit Into the Wild on the top floor which we wandered into but did not have the recommended 'device' to really enjoy - probably just as well as we left when a group of unsupervised and unruly school children arrived and took the venue over - disappointing"
,,Future world = top for kids and parents,4.0,,"Together with our two little kids, we had a lovely quality time at the future world exhibition. Nice interactive things to do!"
,,Perfect,5.0,,My son loved this place. It is interesting for kid. Interactive and curious place for them. The price is good! Perfect place for have fun with kids
,,Future world exhibition,2.0,,Found this very disappointing. Lots of activities for kids but otherwise very expensive for what it is. We were through here in 20 mins(2 adults) and left wondering why there wasn't more. Not what I expected at all.
,,Science Museum,5.0,,Enjoyed the tour specially the drawings which were used to portray a moving scenery and the drawing with tessellation
,,Interesting mixture of art and science,4.0,,"I spent several hours walking through the 3 main exhibits which are an interesting combination of art and science. Future World involves lots of lights and create your own hopscotch or draw vehicles that then appear on a large moving screen - fun for kids and adults. The human+ exhibit was okay - rather different and not for children. The universe and art focused on space. Definitely a different type of museum, but I thought worth the visit."
,,Human+ exhibition,5.0,,"This exhibition is on until the middle of October, 2017. There is an entry fee but it is worth it it you are interested in considering the way technology can modify our bodies and future possibilities. The exhibition is made up of five small sections that include how we are already cyborgs, how robots interact with us, how we could manipulate our ecosystem and what will it mean to be a future human. The last section looks at how babies could be modified in the future and introduces a humanoid social robot. Much of the exhibition is interactive making it more interesting and meaningful."
,,very well done,5.0,,I have visited the museum last june and found some interesting exhibitions. The place is very weel organized and designed. I was on my own but one of the current exhibition that they have is really perfect for kids.
,,Futureworld is good for kids but an expensive light show for adults,3.0,,"I thought I'd duck into Futureworld to kill time. There are some light shows that at least have some good production values, then a lot of interactive games that the kids were loving but I got bored with after 10 minutes."
,,Good afternoon,5.0,,Went here specifically for future world because I saw a review and it sounded awesome. We were 2 mid twenty year olds and spent a lovely almost 2 hours just in future world. Love the light show the most
,,Great!,4.0,,"I bought only Future World Exhibition (one of three Exhibitions), and it's totally good for kids. i just love the crystal light, but at that time it's crowded, so i dont have enough time to take good pictures. For me, the ticket is a bit expensive, for Future World only S$17 per adult."
,,"Thought provoking and interactive, the ArtScience Museum brings out your inner child.",5.0,,"Visiting Future World & the Human+ was an absolute pleasure. In Future World, there are beautiful light exhibits and interactive art and light activities where you colour in aquatic animals or houses and cars. Your designs are then projected onto the walls, where you can interact with them by tapping your projected design. My favourite was definitely the one where you could create mountains and animals by absorbing powers. I went on a Sunday so there was a lot of children there as well. Nevertheless, the drawing stations have many tables and crayons, so even the adults have space to join in the fun.

Human+ was thought provoking and somewhat disturbing in that the content is designed to challenge social norms and create dialogue about the role and evolution of humans to better adapt to the future. Highlight of this exhibition was the end where you can interact with a robot. I missed out on the VR activity which is only available from 2:30PM - 4:30PM.

A few more recommendations is to go during or right after lunch because the crowd is much smaller. The queue when I left the ArtScience Museum was at least 3 times longer than when I bought the tickets. Also, if you sign up for a Sands Rewards Lifestyle Membership (free at the Shoppes concierge), you will receive a ""buy one get one free"" promotion. My friend and I entered the exhibitions for the price of 1 adult ticket instead because of this."
,,"As a teacher, artist and scientist I can't stop raving about this place!",5.0,,"So I am a science teacher and in my previous life a doctor of Tissue Engineering. I am also a an exhibiting artist so appreciate it when all of these interests come under one roof...and what a roof!!! First of all the building itself is a wonder and would be worth a visit if it were empty. With a modern and unusual flower design the space feels like something...well from space! The tariff was fair and the staff really friendly. We spent hours there with our two 'big kids' having just as much fun as the little ones. We were there for the Future Human exhibit and as being the afore mentioned Tissue Engineer this was right up my street with cutting edge robotics and bio-engineering exhibits. There was plenty for us to enjoy, discuss and debate following the exhibit. Everything is executed with the flair and style of MOMA or Tate Modern and the science aspect is engaging and sound. Definitely a must-see. Budget a bit of extra time just in case you get lost in the dreamy exhibits."
,,"The ""Future World"" exhibition is STUNNING!",4.0,,"We visited two exhibitions in the museum.
The first one - ""Future World"" - was simply incredible.
It featured numerous interactive visuals exhibits and movies that left us speechless.
Upon entering the exhibition, make sure not to miss the ""Crows"" movie, which is projected all over the wall and ceiling of the theater. It's mind-blowing!
The other exhibits lets you interact with color - paint some pictures, scan them, and watch them come alive on the big screen and on the floor.
One of the most impressive exhibits, however, is the led display, which includes countless led bulbs, which create STUNNING and interactive scenes of space. The exhibit can be controlled by a controller at the far end of the room.
Entry is 12US$ for adult and it totally worth it.
Don't miss it.
All in all, this is an exhibition for all ages (children absolutely love the interaction).
The second exhibition we've seen was ""The universe and art"" and it was literally a waste of time and space. It's a boring exhibition of unrelated exhibits, and you might as well skip it.
Entry is 8US$ for adult and it totally NOT worth it."
,,It was packed,4.0,,There were numerous people at this Museum. It was the busiest museum I saw in Singapore. It's expensive but it's a great break.
,,"""Exhibit was great for my toddler and us."" Future World Exhibit",4.0,,"The particular exhibit was enjoyable enough for us as well as my toddler. It was dark, which I think was calming. There were people there to keep order, which was great. Many school groups were there at the same time. It took us about 45 minutes to an hour or a little more. We took our time and did everything. Nice addition to the mall area. You can make a day of it--shop, eat, museum and waterside. It was raining at the time I was there so this was perfect."
,,Most Disturbing and Absurd Exhibit I have EVER seen,1.0,,"Went to see the Human+ exhibit with some relatives. It was the most idiotic exhibition I have ever seen.

It started out with a movie of a performance artist strapped to an internet connected robot for hours while strangers around the world manipulated his limbs. Things went downhill from there.

Another highlight was a robotically controlled needle attached to another ""artist's"" arm, which would puncture his arm and draw blood whenever there was a news report of an American GI casualty in IRAQ.

The grand finale was the Euthanasia Coaster, designed with ever tighter loops so that at the end the rider would experience such high G forces that he/she would be killed.

What was really bizarre were the docents giving tours to grade school age school groups discussing this as serious art."
,,Future world exhibit was superb,5.0,,"Had a great morning here, when it was raining outside. The two children loved the Future World exhibit and the LED walkway kept them busy for ages.
The other two exhibits were also very good and it was very interesting to see the original manuscript of Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica, but it was the Future World which made the visit."
,,Must visit place for art lover & creative people,5.0,,I can spend my whole day in this place. Bring me the happiness and creativity. Its worth it. They have different show and I can't wait to come back again to see all the show.
,,Must visit the Future World exhibit!,5.0,,"Their Future World exhibit is nothing short of mind blowing! From the moment you enter to the last step out of the LED walkway, amazing! Really an ingenious balance of art and science."
,,Nice surprise that this was as entertaining as it was.,4.0,,"As I am traveling solo and definitely with no kids, I wasn't too sure ArtScience museum would be of value to me or not, but I am glad I went in!
I hit three exhibits, The Universe and Art, Future World and Human +.
Human + has Nadine, a Robert you can interact with. Hauntingly surreal.
Future World was visually engaging and entertaining- geared for kids to really enjoy, run and interact.
The Universe and Art exhibit was full of ancient and historical drawings, carvings and devices. Pretty cool stuff.
I'm glad I went - you should go to if you have a few extra hours and want out of the Singapore huddle (and humidity)."
,,Visits that Never Get Boring,5.0,,The museum changes the exhibitions every few months and there are 2-4 exhibitions held at one time. Do note that recently the museum gets really crowded so reserve anything between 10-30 minutes of your time to queue for the ticket.
,,A good place ArtScience lover!,4.0,,"If you have the time at marina sand bay area, please feel free to drop by to check out this artscience museum. A good place ArtScience lover!"
,,Current exhibition beautiful,5.0,,The current exhibition titled Future World is wonderful for children. The crystal light display took my breath away. Beautiful building.
,,Fantastic visit,5.0,,"Not sure if it's a permanent exhibit, but the ""Future World - Where Art Meets Science"" exhibit was marvellous. Very unique and quite interactive.

The other one - ""The Universe and Art"" is a more standard exhibition.

If I was taking kids, I'd only go to the Future World exhibit."
,,Futuristic Science,5.0,,One of the must visit for the singapore tour and the kids will love it. Adults will also love it. Must visit.
,,Great!,5.0,,"I personally think this is one of the best features of the MBS area. Three exhibitions and a free film screening on the top. You can get a triple ticket to include all the exhibitions but you'll need a whole day to do all three, in my experience. Try to attend one of the free guided tours if you can - they're done by volunteers with great knowledge and enthusiasm of the topic. My personal favourite is the future world exhibition - greatly exceeded my expectations."
,,Future World Exhibit,5.0,,"We visited the ArtScience Museum on a Thursday afternoon. We bought tickets online and were fortunate to come on an off-peak time. We were actually late because we arrived at around 4:15. Lucky for us, there were few people around so were allowed entry at once without waiting for the next slot at 5:30 pm. For an hour and a half, we were transported to a different universe. The Chasing Crows and Black Waves were both awesome. Sketch Town was so cool, I couldnt't help but draw/color my own spaceship which was later scanned and became part of the 3D Town. We also loved the Story of Time... where you can touch hieroglyphics and see them transform into animals like tiger and elephant. My son was so amazed at the Crystal Universe. He loved how he was able to manipulate the lights and sounds using a touchscreen to create an illusion of dancing stars. We really enjoyed the whole exhibit. The only drawback was that camera flash was not allowed. I wasn't able to take a decent shot with my Iphone. Nonetheless, It was a great digital experience I would recommend to kids and kids at heart."
,,Selected showcase but great collection,4.0,,"Located near the Marina Bay Stands, it is world's first Art-Science museum. The architecture is said to be a form reminiscent of a lotus flower. It exhibits many galleries from combined art/science, media/technology, as well as design/architecture motifs."
,,"High quality, interactive, up-to-date exhibitions. Great job.",5.0,,"So many high quality exhibitions. So little time.

Really impressed that the ArtScience Museum was able to organize so many good quality exhibitions. The toddler was enthralled by the replicas of life-sized astronaut suits at the ticketing counter, and we were tempted to get all the NASA-related memorabilia, but alas, we settled for Future World Exhibition for the sake of the little one.

There were 16 exhibits here. We loved the:
- big slide of an entrance into this ""gigantic playground""
- letting our child design trucks, buildings etc gives meaning to this doodling play, as though letting them have a taste of architecting the future Singapore city
- slightly mind-challenging transportation/river building table play that encourages the young minds (and ours, the adults') to create
- the beautiful waterfall and fishes on the ground... interactive and rather hypnotic to be honest
- the hop-scotch music mat was the absolute favourite of my toddler and so many other older kids I saw queuing for their turn
- the colour-changing blocks and big bouncy balls... what can I say, the kids just cannot leave them. Pretty, mindless fun. Best part is the comfortable leather-cushioned enclosure for this play area that the adults can relax on while the kids roll around on the balls

The hall setup was big and details were well-thought. The staff were polite well-trained and helpful. A very enjoyable afternoon and money absolutely well spent."
,,another must visit place in singapore,5.0,,"so many ArtScince there, oh ya i got buy one get one free ticket if you are new members of marina card, just make a new member its free for sign up"
,,Interesting place for education,4.0,,I visited the arts science museum during May and I have learned alot from the exhibits and enjoyed myself viewing the wonderful and intricate designs of the displays! Would let others know that it is one of the places in Singapore worth visiting!
,,Great museum for children and adults!,5.0,,"We had a blast in the ArtScienceMuseum, particularly in the Future World. So many interactive games and exhibits! We get to color planes, houses, fish and turtle, scan them and watch them come to live on the projections on the walls, then print the colored plane and assemble it. The colorful building blocks and balls were definitely RK's favourite. His parents had more fun than him, probably. By the time we went to the space section with the beautiful strings of light, RK was already cranky so only Yoga could enjoy it in its full glory. And he cried when we went upstairs to a more classic museum setting of Universe and Art exhibit so if you travel with kids, perhaps it's better to stick to the Future World part (and save your money).

Art and science are a killer combo for sure. A recommended site to visit in Singapore!

Tips: book through internet to skip the queue at ticketing office, come in time as chosen when you booked it -- we chose the earliest one at 10 am."
,,Iconic Lotus Building,5.0,,"ArtScience Museum is the iconic lotus-inspired at Marina Bay. It is a living and breathing art and science through exhibitions, events, performances and educational activities. We can explores creative processes at the heart of art, science, technology and culture."
,,Spectacular,4.0,,"We visited the Future World exhibit and absolutely loved it. Spent a good 90 minutes wandering through and enjoying the interactive exhibits. My favourite museum experience. Only criticism is that it's quite expensive for one exhibit, and we would have liked to visit the other but there was no combo deal."
,,The Architecture of the building itself and ALL the exhibitions are great.,5.0,,"Flowers, Architecture Art and ,Children museums , in one place , what a dream building and absolutely a place to visit and see the views of the city before entering to see what ever exhibition is being sown. CAN NOT BE MISS."
,,Great place...but bad logistics,2.0,,"One should visit this museum with kids...it's got good exhibits which kids love. But logistics are really terrible - doesn't feel like it's in the efficient city of Singapore.

We made a mistake of not booking tickets online prior to the visit (and just try using the mobile app to book at the venue - tough nut).

It was a long queau as the picture below shows...50 odd people ahead of us. Pace of queau movement was really slow. Obviously it's good to have a crowd. But on a holiday (1st May) can't see how the organisers had only one counter open with a relatively inefficient t person behind the tills.

Anyways we wasted 90 minutes to get in. You shouldn't - book online rather than relying on inefficient staff and missing a good place to visit."
,,Great musuem,5.0,,This museum has themes for set periods of time. There is a permanent exhibition called Future World which draws together Art and Technology. The exhibition features a collection of art and interactive projects which are very suitable for children and adults alike. The 4D Light show was particularly impressive. There is a small admission charge which is payable at the Museum
,,Wonderful experience,4.0,,"A great place for a few hours immersed in lights, sounds and illusions making space for creativity and imagination. Some parts are surely invigorating and moving; while some are more child-oriented. Still blown away by the galaxy one at the end - definitely breath taking and one-of-a-kind."
,,Good museum,4.0,,"Its an interesting museum with various exhibitions, including some night events and/or presentations."
,,Loved the free Into the Wild exhibit!,4.0,,"We signed up online with the helpful staff at the Marina Bay Information desk and loved this virtual adventure, using IPads. At one point we were sure we were the only adults as everyone else was a kid, but we can tell you this appeals to all ages! Loved the WWF link and the cinematic experience lying on big bean bags. The Artscience museum in itself is worth a visit, there appeared lots to see and do there."
,,"Interactive exhibitions, great day at the museum!",4.0,,"We visited the FutureWorld exhibition, exhibition with multiple interactive art installations. Lovely experience!

One memorable one is when you stand amidst a bridge of lights and the light show changes every few seconds. Like you were in a futuristic galaxy. You can also take turns to ""create"" the light shows at a selection panel on the other side. Mesmerising.

Some installations at Futureworld change every now and then, so it helps to check back for updates. Would definitely go again!"
,,interesting exhibition,5.0,,"i went to see the space exploration exhibition. if you like history and science, or you're into cool stuff, i would definitely recommend this place."
,,Mindblowing,5.0,,"Like what it's name states, this is the place where art meets science, the installations will definitely give you chills. There's 4 main sections has its own uniqueness. We went around 2pm on the weekday so it's not very crowded.

We paid $10 as a local student (applies to exchange students too) and queued through the NETS counter. Cash payment counter was quite a long queue

Definitely a place for tonnes of amazing photos so prepare your camera and grab some friends to nail your instagram shots. Random tip: it's all dark inside so mostly you'll be getting silhouette shots, unless you are standing in front of the projection. So perhaps you won't need too much of makeup/styling."
,,Art science museum at Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,Took my grandchildren there while visiting them last year in the school holidays. We spent the whole day there and had to virtually drag them out when it was time to go. Great for all ages.
,,Excellent Exhibitions,5.0,,"Most of the time - different exhibit will be displayed in ArtScience Museum. This is highly recommended for all. It also depends on the exhibitions available and to each an individual interest. For me, each time there's a new exhibition which interest me - It will be an exciting view for me."
,,Very great,4.0,,very interesting .. i go there for my work and friends okay but i like the artsy design and the air con .
,,Nice,5.0,,"Very good, your kids will love this place. My advice to the museum is about the stairs that heading up towards the slides, there should be a soft handle / some kind of protector or any kind of safety. When kids get too existed, they dont care other children and when they cant find anything to hold they hold other kids instead which can cause them to fall"
,,"Great for kids, good for adults.",4.0,,Set right on the water in a wonderful building the exhibitions are very entertaining. Probably more aligned for the younger generation it still had some amazing exhibits.
,,Positively surprising,5.0,,"We visited the exhibition Future world, i.e. Art and Science, and spent about 2 hours. The ticket costed 17 S$ per exhibition, which was absolutely moderate. Presumably the Nature exhibition is free of charge, but it was closed due to updating at the time.
It was not a boring poster exhibition, but very interactive with movies, slide, painting and sounds. There were a lot of children obviously having fun. But we also had a lot of fun as adults."
,,Best Museum for kids in Singapore,5.0,,"What a great Museum this is! All of my three children absolutely loved it and we spent several hours going through all the parts. We were also happily surprised that on Fridays children have free access to the museum. Warmly recommend to visit ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,"
,,"Create, Learn and Science",5.0,,"What a fantastic interactive centre, must first of all to mention Hansel at ticketing who provided guidance to my multi national family, a credit to MBS. The centre is great for kids and adult, I thought it was going to be boring but at the end was engaging and fun time with the kids. Highly recommend the art centre and open your mind."
,,Kids will love it,5.0,,"My kids love to spend day in there. It not helping you from wallet drowned when they are at the mall, but kids can learn many things"
,,1st Class venue,5.0,,This venue has many different exhibitions on show and so one must choose if what is being shown is of interest.Whilst I was there the Space programme was being displayed and was a 1st class exhibition. There are toilets and a cafe on site and access is available for less able visitors as there is a lift to all floors.
,,"Highly interactive & magical world, esp for the kids",5.0,,It's a must visit place for kids. We only went to the art section where you can colour & scan you images on to the screen. It's a great feeling to see your creation either walking on the ground or moving on the big wall to wall screen. It's magical word of colours & light. Will be difficult to get your kids to leave.
,,Fun art,4.0,,"Agree, this place thats where art meet science.
Acctualy this place good for children. For visit galery enough for 30 minute (adult) cause amost exibition good for children.
Most popular is furure world (crystal univers).
Tips: before visit this museum, better you make marinabays sand life style card for free. You can make thats card at mbs mall.
Benefit is: with mbs card you can buy 1 get 1 free
Just enjoy!"
,,Cool space with cool exhibitions.,5.0,,"This place makes both adults and kids happy! The Future World was amazing, interactive and interesting. Make sure you book tickets online to avoid long queue for the ticket purchase, I was there on a Sunday and it took me 45 mins from the starting line until the cashier point."
,,The exhibition was good,4.0,,"It was really pretty, all the exhibition designed really great! And we could take a really good picture and the staff never really bother you, unless you made changes to the exhibition to preserve it and made sure we're not breaking it. But otherwise, it was a good visit!"
,,Nice to visit,4.0,,"I love how they creat light and color workshop... When you at MBS mall, first step is Register yourself as a member of MBS mall to get promo buy one get one ticket to art science museum"
,,Such a Fun place!!!,5.0,,I was surprised how it was very interactive and fun it was!! Even for adults! I guess it depends on what the exhibit is/are. I was a bit disappointed that there was only one exhibit going on because it felt like it was short? But overall its a fun place!
,,FUTURE WORLD,5.0,,the exhibition was excellent. Interesting quite well done. The colouring of animals and building was fun and most suitable for kids even for adults who just want to sit down and have fun. After drawing u just have to put through a scanner and then your drawing will come out on the big screen itself
,,Cool place - changing expositions,4.0,,Very cool place - the value you will get depends on the exposition at the time. We visited a kid focused one and we had a great 2 hours of family time.
,,Cool Collections,5.0,,"Casual, contemporary and credible. This place is an art gallery and science exhibition centre rolled into one. The exhibits are well-spaced and arranged. Apart from the permanent exhibits which we love, we always look forward to the temporary exhibits. Worth the time and money."
,,Interactive Exhibition,4.0,,"I visited the ""Future World - Where Art meets Science"" exhibition for 17S$. The performaces were really good and I liked that you could interact with the objects. The exhibition was quite small and if you have kids thats the place to go. I was a little bit jealous cause the kids could do soo many stuff. The only con was that they just have this one exhibition at the moment.

On 4.April theirs gonna be another about the forest and wildlife (sorry don't know the name) that one is free of charge."
,,Waste of money and time,2.0,,"Entered the museum and paid 27 dollars each. Starting at the lower levels we found out that three out of four floors were closed due to change of expositions. This should be told before we bought tickets, but they didn't. At the end we have seen one lightshow of 5 minutes and stayed only 15 minutes in this museum to see all there was to see. Anyway a real rip off and will never visit this museum again"
,,Very Interesting,5.0,,I took my baby here twice. My baby is 2.5 year old now. She enjoyed it every much. Adults like me and my husband also enjoyed it a lot. Love the crystal maze. incredible amazing and beautiful.
,,'NASA – A Human Adventure',5.0,,"As a fan of all things 'space', the 'NASA – A Human Adventure' was a must see while in Singapore. The exhibits included space-flown artifacts as well as high quality facsimiles. We really enjoyed the experience, even the go in the 2G centrifuge..."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"On the day we visited there was a wonderful display of equipment, film clips etc about NASA and space exploration . There was also an excellent children's area with interactive exhibits. One of the levels was closed and the upper level showed an animated jungle scene that repeated at , about, seven minute intervals. A great attraction is the light projection at night, on the outer surface of three of the lotus leave walls. Entry is free however there was a charge to the NASA and children's exhibitions.
Probably better to check which exhibitions and galleries are showing prior to deciding to go, or you may be disappointed"
,,Pure FUN!!!!,5.0,,"If you have children, or you are a child in your soul, this is THE PLACE to be:)
Apart from the fact that it has a lot of real educational value and can teach kids a lot, the interactive visual displays are pure fun that can last for hours.
You can draw sea creatures that will swim in a virtual aquarium, you can build virtual cities by moving blocks on a table, you can play with balls that change their color whenever they are subject to acceleration or build constructions with blocks that change their color based on the neighboring blocks.
It is so much fun, you won't want to leave"
,,Got kids? a Rainy Day?,5.0,,This is a great spot to spend some time indoors. Us Oldsters enjoyed it during a downpour. The local kids were loving it and running like madmen. Adorable.
,,Rainy afternoon in Singapore,4.0,,"My partner and I spent a few hours wondering through the NASA Space Exhibition, keeping dry from the recent thunderstorms. To our surprise, entry was buy1 get 1 free (for adults) and the exhibition itself was well organised and insightful."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"The building looks great, but not a lot to look at inside, a great disappointment , it's best to sit on the outside by the Lilly flowers."
,,Fun and different,5.0,,"I thought the museum was fun and interesting and, contrary to some other reviews, I liked it as an adult with no kids. I never had interactive exhibits like the drawing and scanning when I was a kid, so I thought it was very fun to see your creation up on the wall in the ""aquarium"" and to see my truck drive in the little Singapore city. The light balls and walls were pretty and colorful and the light tables where you play with the little gnome people and cows was funny and silly.

I thought the NASA exhibit was incredibly well done and I've been to the one at Cape Canaveral in Florida and in some ways thought this was better. I've been to more than 3 space museums and at this one, I still learned new things and was engaged. I particularly liked the front section with the side by side of Glenn and Gagarin and seeing the differences between the Russian space race and the American one. I also loved seeing the film brought back from the moon.

We unfortunately did not get to do the free Into the Wild exhibit as they were on an hour wait but it was a hot Saturday afternoon so that wasn't surprising. I saw many people using the tablets and they looked like they were having fun.

The museum is also really easy to get around and navigate. The day that I went there was a buy one get one free admission into NASA and a discount for Future World, so it was a wonderful value."
,,Singapore Trip,5.0,,Best place to go alone or family with kids. always you can learn something new. Great place! We love this museum!
,,"Engaging exhibits, guided tours, and workshops",4.0,,"Opened in 2011, this lotus-shaped museum at Marina Bay Sands is one of Singapore’s most iconic buildings. The museum offers a fascinating variety of events and exhibits and provides public guided tours in both English and Mandarin.

We thoroughly enjoyed exploring the NASA interactive space-flight exhibition, learning about mankind’s exploration of space through the more than 200 rockets, space suits, moon rocks, and other objects on display. What an educational adventure for children and a walk down memory lane for older folks who remember the day humans first set foot on the moon!

Note that there are separate entrance fees for each exhibit. If you are going to the museum with children, plan to visit on a Friday when every adult ticket purchased includes free entry for four children."
,,Lots of fun!,5.0,,"We all loved the ArtScience Museum! So much fun for the kids..especially the interactive displays. Colorful, fun and magical place :)"
,,Future world and NASA exhibits,4.0,,"We only did future world as we've seen NASA stuff before. Future world is good for kids probably up to 10 years old. Mine was 5 and he loved the concept. The main activity requires the kids ( and you!) to colour in some pics from a theme (aquatic, urban/ space), feed the pic into a scanner and it projects onto a large screen. Kids (and adults) will get a kick out of seeing their pic animated on the big screen.

Note that two of the rooms were closed when we went so there is reduced pricing of $7 per adult. We probably spent about 2 hours at the museum.

It was a very quiet, dark space for kids to be creative, and to be more mindful.

There is also a free interactive activity using a tablet which requires you to follow a path, find some animals and plant seeds, followed by a 6 minute video. Note you do need photo id for each person that wants a tablet.

There is a mall with a great food court next door to the museum.

Within walking distance there is also art-zoo. Think this is a temporary installation- we didn't go in, but it is a large inflatables park. Not sure if it is free."
,,A nice way to spend a morning if there is nothing else to do,3.0,,You will have to pay separate entrance fees for each exhibit. Went to the FutureWorld Exhibit. Nothing very futuristic about it..just a play with lights. Lights dancing..lights following you around..lights light up in various designs..you get the picture..
,,Great mix of art and science!,4.0,,We enjoyed the museum due to the mix presentations and visual effects. Children 5-10 would find this place amazing. If you are on a tight schedule one can view everything in less than a couple of hours.
,,Never Again,1.0,,"The museum is great, a beautiful building, but my experience was completely ruined by having to stand in line for 90 minutes on a weekend afternoon to buy a ticket. There was only one ticket counter open -- the museum should have been better staffed on a weekend, it's common sense -- for more than 200 people in line. So unlike other attractions I visited in Singapore which were efficient and lines moved quickly."
,,From the outside to the inside a great exprrience.,5.0,,"This was a place for the family. It was a joy to see the children moving around with a device solving an IT quiz.The building was eye catching, the impression it made was instrumental in us visiting. If thst is the outside the inside must be better. The experience did not disappoint"
,,Interesting Exhibitions Combining Art and Science,4.0,,The museum has some very interesting exhibitions that relate art and science and make it a lot more interesting for kids. Tickets can be booked online at discounted rates.
,,great family activity,5.0,,We went on a Friday and there was a special discount for Friday. There was various exhibition at the time. My 9 year old son loved it . We had a lot of fun and it was not crowded
,,great fun for all ages,5.0,,we visited all three exhibitions and had a great time. this is an unusual building from the outside but fun inside. the area surrounding is also lovely
,,Must see museum,5.0,,"Part of the Marina Bay Sands is the curiously shapes Art Science Museum. Its exhibitions are world class and its design is iconic. It is symbolic of the welcoming hand of Singapore with 10 fingers. Natural light filters in through the tip of each finger so the exhibits are seen in the best light. There are 21 galleries spread over three storeys with a total floor space of about 50,000 sq ft.
As the name suggests, ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands beautifully fuses art and science to tell fascinating stories. This premier venue houses a constantly changing line-up of major international touring exhibitions, brought in through collaborations with organisations such as the American Museum of Natural History, the Smithsonian Institute and world-renowned furniture designer Herman Miller."
,,Great expo,4.0,,"I been there few times, I'm usually annoyed by people stake pics every where with flash and with out care the others. Today at the door staff inform it's not allow to use flash, and peoples follow it.
I Vi it that museum every time I come to singapore, always nice expo, price bit high but it's great job"
,,Amazing Journey,5.0,,"Was actually saving some money to go here as i was finding the fact that admission fee is SGD40 for all attractions ticket and for foreigners. So when i came there through Marina Bay Sands, i asked its location to a lady in information booth then she gave me maps and direction but also told me that if i apply for the MBS membership card (which is FREE just gave your passport while applying), foreigners will be having great discount for all attractions throughout MBS ! So i applied for the card in another booth, in less than 10 min, i got the card and voila! Artscience museum promo is, buy 1 ticket get 1 free ticket. So at the moment the adms fee was SGD 30/person and with this card, i got 2 ticket as that price. Worth a deal!! And you can enter 3 great exhibitions, but my fave is the Future World exhibitions. OMG amazing!"
,,Loved this place!,5.0,,"This was a great indoor activity.

At the time I visited this is what was on exhibit:

MC Escher collection: very extensive of a lot of his work. I enjoyed this.
NASA Exhibit: all sorts of artifacts and displays from various missions.
Interactive art: this was my favorite. Visitors can decorate coloring pages and watch them come to life on the huge protection on the wall. This is great for all ages!

You can buy a pass for just one exhibit or a combo for more than one"
,,A Must See whilst in Singapore,5.0,,We visited the Art Science Museum which is easy to find at Marina Bay Sands. We visited the 3 exhibitions which are currently showing there and loved them all. A place to visit whether you're young or old. You don't need to have a love art or science to enjoy this Museum. Do not miss this one.
,,Great architecture museum,5.0,,"The design and decor of this architectural building is so fascinating, just next to Marina Bay Sands. There are modern art exhibitions and some of them are well worth to visit. We started our visit at the first floor with Human Adventure about NASA, followed by wonderful Journey to Infinity, great collection of Escher paintings; last room - Future World, that is more suitable for kids but with very inspiring pieces of art that I found interesting and futuristic. I enjoyed the flower room, and the waterfall. It is very easy to get your way around, as the museum is very simple to navigate. I recommend to see the museum from the outside and take pictures from the bridge next to it, the views are wonderful."
,,Interesting,5.0,,"If possible, do get tickets online. I am a student, so it was cheaper for me. Exhibitions are very interesting and well thought out. I am hoping that there will bring in more events that can attract more millienials."
,,worth visiting place,5.0,,"This is one of the main reasons I want to visit Singapore for my holiday. After seeing several pictures of this museum from my friends, I always want to have chance to visit this place, especially the Future World. And I didn't disappointed with my expectation. I am so enjoyed that I can spend days in it. I'm particular impressed with the light show. Millions of led lights continuously sparkles that makes you feel like you lost in the galaxy.
Worth visiting"
,,Future World Exhibition really good,5.0,,We visited the Future Word exhibition which is billed as where art meets science. Its a collection of very clever technology to crate artistic images / structures. The 100years sea animation diorama was both relaxing and worrying. The other really spectacular exhibit was the crystal universe - hundreds of thousands of LEDs in strings flashing in never ending moving sequences. Really worth seeing. There are other exhibits for kids in particular like coloured cubes(block chair) and light balls and simulated cities(Sketch town) etc.
,,A lovely museum.,4.0,,"This is a lovely museum, which can easily take 2-3 hours to explore. The permanent exhibition as well as the changing ones were absolutely lovely, with a nice and cool combination of art and science. It's a perfect escape from a hot day, too."
,,Astonoshing Exhibits!,5.0,,I went there when they were exhibiting Leonardo Da Vinci. The place is never ending. I couldn't believe myself to see the original hand written scrips by the Da Vinci himself.
,,Three great exhibits visited in a day!,5.0,,"On a hot afternoon, my husband and I decided to visit the Art Science Museum to escape the heat. There were three exhibits going on... one called Future World - where art meets science; another one with a focus on NASA; and the third one on the work of MC Escher. All three were great! We bought a discounted ticket for all three (they offer discounts to Singapore residents) so one entry to each exhibit costs us a total of 68 SGD for the two of us.

The line to purchase a ticket was long so we wish we had purchased the tickets online in advance. Also we are members of Marina Bay Sands but had forgotten to bring our membership card, so we couldnt benefit from the even-deeper discount offered to card holders. If you're a member, make sure to take your card - it could have saved us 50%.

Our favorite exhibit was NASA, followed by MC Escher. The Future World exhibit was really good too, but on a Saturday afternoon, there were a lot of family with children so it was very packed and loud."
,,Potential...but a little disappointing,4.0,,"Heavily hyped interactive arts/science boundary zone work disappointed. As so often with the audio/visual interface, the visual elements display more appeal and intricacy, with audio elements either feeble or unsuited to the acoustic. Luckily most were designed for children who would have responded well to the simple game type interfaces. Apart from the delightful object detection on table works the level of interactivity and complexity of response was quite low. The building itself is wonderful. The NASA exhibition had some appealing displays; one of our favourites was the interactive globe, which however was lacking in clarity about the significance of what was being displayed when in the less obvious modes. And much of the tour was just a typical picture/model display which might have originated in a funding pitch or progress report from NASA. Apart from the gravity simulator, little that was truly interactive, so seemed more hype than real creative boundary work. Escher exhibition was conventional and comprehensive, not pretending to be more than it was so ended up the mosengrossing part of tye afternoon."
,,NASA Exhibit !,5.0,,"An exciting and informative look into the past and future of space travel, enjoy a simulated ride on a space craft !"
,,Beware of Light Ball Orchestra,1.0,,"This is the 2nd time we visited this exhibition. Things are ageing. 1st visit was when it just open. Used to be able to print out your work and make it into a 3D object but now you can on scan and send it to the wall.

My girl was not wearing long pants she got bad scratches from Light Ball Orchestra, while playing with the big balls. Strongly urge the Museum to check all the Balls.

What a shame both electronic tablet are not functioning at Create! Hopscotch for Geniuses

What remain the same is still the price!"
,,Worth a Visit!!,5.0,,"This Museum was a recommendation from a close friends who is a museum-lover, and we were blown away!! From the outside the Architecture is AMAZING! There are 3 exhibitions and we chose to do 3 of them. They are all very unique in their own way but Escher's art exhibitions and the Future world are my top picks. It is quite inspiring and I even more so when I read more about his stories happened in the 30's That concept of Metamorphosis is absolutely mesmerising! Yes it is great for all ages and all backgrounds whether you are a art fan or a starter. You could come in to see one show and then back again on the same day to see the other two, like we did. We went out for lunch and then came back. Please do yourself a favour come to visit this museum."
,,Great for all ages.,5.0,,We saw the M. C. Escher exhibit. The subject matter and explanations gave a window into the artist. Children will enjoy the interactive component.
,,Below my Expectations,3.0,,"We bought the ticket for the 3 active exhibitions, and I'm glad we did it: we were thinking about buying only for the 2 permanent (Future World and NASA), but for something like 2SGD more, we could see Escher's, which we had no idea what was about. This last one happened to be our favourite!

Future World is great for kids. For us, it was fun, but not interesting.

NASA was somehow a disappointment: it is small and we did not learn much (or nothing) from it...

Escher's World of Wonder was a wonderful surprise, and we're glad we found it still open! It's about Escher's works and his perspective of the world, and how he has influenced it in many ways (CD covers, art, even movies and music videos). We did not know who he was and we've learned a lot about this interesting artist!"
,,Distinctive architecture with wonderfully curated exhibits,4.0,,"This place has no shortage of great concepts, opened my eyes to art, history and contemporary cultures. Great for family and kids, always something new for everyone. I would recommend going for guided tours if there is one (there usually is). This is just beside Marina Bay Sands Shoppes, just before the helix bridge. It is hard to miss the giant lotus flower towering over you!

The seats just outside the musuem pond has blasts of cold air emanating from the vents. Perfect for resting sore legs after walking, since it's perpertually humid here in Singapore."
,,Great for vids,4.0,,"Maybe not so much for adults. I'm pretty biased because I don't really appreciate art/work of NASA aircraft but I went because I ran out of things to do in Singapore. Entry is $30 for all three attractions with the buy one get one free scheme from Marina Bay Sands club membership (freely obtainable inside the mall). The future world attraction was my favourite, especially the light works at the end. Pretty crowded but I enjoyed it."
,,Simply the best!,5.0,,"The best museum to visit with kids in Singapore. Very carefully designed, paradise for us and the kids. Words are not enough!"
,,"Beautiful architecture, great exhibits",5.0,,"You can just drop into the ArtScience Museum - there is a small cafe and some tables where you can have something to eat or drink and escape the heat.

When we visited in Jan 17 we saw these exhibits:
• A Human Adventure (an exhibit about space travel, the USA & Russia space race, and spacecraft, tools and suits through time. There was also a ""ride"" that simulates g-force, I believe it was about 2g, and cost 6$S on the spot)
• Future World (this was a night, colourful and interactive exhibit - it is had to explain but my favourite of the tree. It was a beautiful mixture of art, technology and human movement)
• Journey to Infinity (a display of Esther's work and his influence on modern graphic art - this was also a great walk though, particularly the ""metamorphosis"" displays).

I loved the whole lot, but Future World was my favourite. We purchased a ticket to all three exhibits at the door and it cost 30$S I believe, which is less than if you were to visit each separately.

We did this on our last day, before our flight and it was just perfect.

We accessed the ArtScience Museum through the train station at Marina Bay Sands and it was just a short walk through the shops. You can also catch the #10 bus to the Esplanade and walk across Helix bridge (which I highly recommend as you walk past Merlion Park and over the Memorial Bridge also)."
,,"Simply Amazing. If you have kids, you must come here.",5.0,,"We purchased our tickets (family of 5) from Klook, which gave us a small discount and arrived at opening time to make the most of our day spent exploring this area of Singapore. Do try and get here when it opens, as things do get busier as the day progresses and this would make it crowded inside and hard to not only keep a track of where your kids are but also to have the time and space to enjoy the activities.
Our 14 year loved this place and our 6 and 7 year old's even more. The digital interactive elements to the art aspect of the museum were innovative and exciting (future world). The NASA space travel component to the Science section of the museum was excellent and our kids really enjoyed this too. In January there is an Eschar exhibition, which was a fascinating insight to the artists incredibly prolific career. There are hands on activities too. It was one of our best days out while in Singapore and this is a place not to miss if you have kids under 14 years of age."
,,Beautiful structure built near marina bay sands,4.0,,"A nice experience both for adults and kids, the lotus shaped structure is amazing and one of its kind."
,,We love future world exhibition,5.0,,"We come here every month, just to visit Future World and occasionally some other seasonal exhibitions like NASA Space. It's easily to kill 2/3 hours at Future World alone. Every element is our Favourite! Tip, book online to avoid the long ticketing queue. It's easy Abd its worry free!"
,,Definitely worth visiting,4.0,,"Beautiful building, interesting exhibitions. In January 2017 they had the space exhibition and future exhibition - the first one was impressive and informative. About the second one - I expected more, thought it was nice experience as well. Especially the installations. Yes, go there. Will not regret! Good for families, couples, people in any age."
,,Great location with two very good exhibitions on now,4.0,,"This futuristic building has a great setting on the Bay. Good coffee and snack bar at the main entrance. I went around all four exhibitions - two were excellent - NASA – A Human Adventure and Journey to Infinity, and Escher’s World of Wonder. The Future World was really not particularly good for adults, but looked to be fun for kids, who could play with coloured blocks, lights, spheres, build, arrange and construct things.

I wasn't impressed by the Water films - got bored within 15 minutes of not very much happening. Took 2.5 hours to really do justice to NASA and Escher. Pretty good value for $SD 30, given that Singapore is not exactly the cheapest place on Earth."
,,Interesting exhibit,3.0,,"We visited the Art Science Museum on a rainy day in Singapore which was a perfect indoor activity. The Museum had many intriguing interactive displays for people of all ages to enjoy.

It did seem rather small compared to some similar museums I have been to."
,,great exhibition,5.0,,Came here to see the Eischer exhibition. The museum is well organised with a greeter at the door who steered us in the right direction to purchase tickets etc. The toilets are clean and the ticket buying system was easy to use and the queue for tickets (though it was long) went quickly. We really loved the Eischer display. There was a mix of hands on activities and interactive things to do e.g. the relativity and mirror rooms and mobius strips. As well as art work to see. A peaceful and cool place to come and enjoy good art.
,,A Thrilling Place to be at! A Must Visit!,5.0,,"I had been underestimating about the place, ArtScience? as I only imagined it would not be a worthy place to go. But, a very good friend of mine convinced me that this place is a must-visit. Thank God I got invited to visit it this time.

To my amazement I was so happy when we got in. My favorite artist Escher - his tons of work were exhibited. So I need not go to his museum in Vienna, had a plan to go there. So so thrilled to look at many of Escher's work. Best part of my visit here

Then I was again stunned with more interactive exhibitions in this museum, how science can be combined with arts. I was brought into a different dimension.

So much to learn, to be aware of on what kind of achievements mandkind have so far. Then the interaction with nature or the galaxy?

Unable to express into words how the museum affected me as it was all the experience and feeling like in a journey of imagination, to another dimension, or making you look differently towards life.

It has the sensory stuff to make an effect on you. How much fun I had! Will definitely go back there!"
,,Family activity,5.0,,"The museum is really a great place to visit, it really doesn't matter if you are young or adult, it does have really good stuff, the art is amazing and you will definitely learn a lot."
,,Another great day for young and old,4.0,,"A multitude of interactive displays and activities, suitable for everybody but particularly young and older children; but good for parents and grandparents to watch on, at least."
,,"Great exhibits, good location.",4.0,,"Varied exhibits to see from interesting artists to natural history. Good displays, nice choice of artist's work. Pretty outside with flowers and skyline views"
,,Very Good Exhibits,4.0,,"I wanted to see the Escher exhibition and others in our party wanted to see the NASA - A Human Adventure. Both exhibitions were well worth visiting, well displayed and for us an ideal way to spend a few hours."
,,Interactive for Adults and Children,4.0,,"We went here because they had an Escher exhibit, but did all of their museums while we were there. It is a small museum, and you can spend as much or as little time as you want (depending on how much of the interactive play you want to do). Being technical in nature, we skipped the drawing stations, but spent some time with the interactive computer exhibits. We would definitely recommend this."
,,Fantastic exhibits and excellent value,5.0,,"Having previously visited the museum during a Da Vinci exhibit, I already knew what good value the new MC Escher exhibit would be. We stayed for about 2 hours looking at the three exhibits on offer and we were pleased with the amount of child friendly activities available.

I'd definitely go again - make sure to show your Marina Bay Sands hotel card to get a discounted entry price."
,,Interesting but not fantasic for young kids!,4.0,,"Visited the NASA A Human Adventure exhibition a few days ago and an exhibition on the CERN particle accelerator in 2016.

The interior of the museum was nicely air conditioned (it was a hot day!), clean toilets. I like the cafe on the ground floor right in front of the entrance. Offers a great view of Marina Bay while you sip a cup of coffee ;)

The exhibitions would generally appeal to people aged 10 and above depending on the subject. The NASA exhibition was generally interesting and quite kid friendly with the various displays of astronaut equipment, space food etc. Reminds me of a ultra compressed Smithsonian Air and Space Museum exhibition (although nowhere as good). The particle accelerator exhibition however was extremely content (Physics) heavy with many long technical explanations. Definitely boring and too difficult for children aged 12 and below to understand and appreciate.

Discounted tickets available for Singaporeans, students, the elderly and children. I recommend taking a look a the website before making a trip down. There are occasionally some free exhibitions worth taking a look at."
,,Just average,3.0,,Better to buy advanced tickets online to avoid long queues. Had to go through a long line to get to the Futureworld exhibition. Not much to see but a good place for photos.
,,An interactive Museum where art meets science,5.0,,"This is a museum that combines art and science and can be enjoyed by both children and adults. The interactive displays inside the museum are interesting and unique using technology. Spend an hour, at least to tour around and experience the exhibits, and stay longer if you have children with you because more activities cater to younger ages."
,,For kids,3.0,,Expected a bit more educational scientific approach. It's made for kids generally. But al in all not a big waste of time
,,dont understand ............,3.0,,"dont understand ............
the concept of this ""museum"". some parts seem to be suitable for young kids, some parts for adults. for us the best was the werner herzog movie about the internet. free entrance. entrance fee's are much too high for what is offered.

would not recommend this place."
,,Best Museum,5.0,,"So interactive, so much to do and learn. The best museum I have ever been to, would definitely go back again."
,,Where art meets science,5.0,,"I only entered the future world since I don't have much time exploring this museum...but what i can say is the future world is STUNNING and AMAZING...if you travel to Singapore, this place must be on your list...if you have more time, you can explore more with package entry fee, more economical..."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,Had a great afternoon here as two adults. The Future World was so much fun - we stepped back into our childhood and drew fooled about and took it all in. For children it would be fantastic. The NASA exhibition was also very good. Well worth the trip!
,,Decent Afternoon Out With The Kids,4.0,,"We visited the Marina Bay Sands ArtScience Museum's Future World, NASA, and Escher art exhibits. My kids, ages 11, 8, and 5, all really enjoyed the Future World exhibit, were lukewarm about NASA and didn't really enjoy the art exhibit.

I'd avoid the art exhibit in the future with kids of this age group - just not enough ""engagement"" for them. That said, the kids thoroughly enjoyed the Future World exhibit. It really was a well-done amalgamation of art and science...and we would probably have spent the whole day there if not for the parents noting that there was more to see elsewhere in the museum! In Future World, the museum has done a great job creating a few similar areas where patrons can create artwork and then see their creations ""come to life"" on large viewing screens, all part of a larger display/interaction with other patrons' work. The displays were a floor ecosystem, a village, and a seascape. There were other interesting interactive activities as well, all helping to blur the line between art and science.

The NASA exhibit is very professionally-done. It's been awhile, but it reminded me of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum exhibits in Washington DC. I enjoyed it as an adult but it was unfortunately a little too much reading and too little interaction for kids of our age.

The museum was very busy when we arrived at around noon on a Friday. Families may consider arriving earlier in the day and buying tickets online. If you do decide to buy tickets online, you can avoid the lines at the museum and pick them up at the equivalent of a ""will call""."
,,Interesting enough for an hour or so.,4.0,,"We came here with family to visit the Future World and Space exhibits. I found Future World very fun even though our party's youngest kids were 14. They had fun drawing pictures to be scanned onto the interactive wall. The light room was also a lot of fun especially since you can control them via an app on your phone. I don't think anyone else knew about that so our kids were controlling it the whole time. The space exhibit was decent but since we live near the Museum of Flight in WA state, it doesn't really compare. If you have a few hours free while it is raining outside or whatever, this museum would be a fun distraction."
,,A first time eXperiece,3.0,,"We visited the Future World, Escher's World of Wonder and NASA exhibits on sponsored tickets. Lots of kids in the museum. Be amazed by the artistic tessellation works of M.C. Escher. Having seen all the contents, don't think I will be interested for a revisit. Might not be value for money if you are not a fan of arts."
,,nice place for kids when raining,3.0,,"Visited the ""Future World"" Exhibition. fun and interactive indoor activities for kids ranging 3 to 10. PS: their online booking system is so awkward and user unfriendly ..."
,,Fun Activities,5.0,,"I went to the Art Science Museum for the Future World exhibition. While the educational value did not seem very high, the exhibition was fun and we spent around 1.5 hours here. There were lights projections and installations that were nice for taking photographs. There were also activities targeted at children, such as a digital hopscotch. My favourite activities were the Sketch Christmas / Sketch Town / Sketch Aquarium. There was a range of colouring pages to choose from. Crayons and wet tissue were supplied. Both children and adults were delighted when they scanned in their colouring pages and saw their 2D creations become 3D ones in large interactive screens. Note that the crayons were not in great condition, so you might want to bring along your own set of crayons.

Future World has specific admission times at 10am, 11.30am, 1pm, 2.30pm, 4pm and 5.30pm. There are long queues for purchasing tickets at Art Science Museum, so you might want to start queuing for tickets 15-30 minutes before the admission time you want. Alternatively, purchase your tickets online or at other locations.

The ticketing area had a TV screen publicising this good deal which I was unfortunately not eligible for, but I think many people will find it helpful. If you are 21 years old and above, sign up for a Sands Rewards LifeStyle card. Signing up is free and can be done at The Shoppes, Canal Level, B2 (near Skating Rink). With this card, you can get a free ticket with purchase of a standard ticket at the Art Science Museum."
,,Unique Museum,5.0,,never expected that museum looks like this before. they can combine between art and science became a wonderful museum.
,,Beautiful museum; value would depend on what's on show,4.0,,"Beautifully designed building located outside The Shoppes next to Marina Bay Sands and the Gardens by the Bay.

Is pretty pricey and there was quite a long queue to purchase tickets. Note is not a large museum.

Value will depend on what's on show as they appear to rotate their exhibits. When we visited, there were three - Future World (geared towards kids - lots of lights and techy play areas - almost felt like a upmarket playground); a space travel exhibit; and an exhibit of Escher's works which was very well done and managed to be interactive at points (clearly this exhibit was the highlight for me!)."
,,A lighten up playground,2.0,,"Came out highly disappointed from the ""Future World"" exhibition. Expected more creative interaction possibilities or learning about future tech ideas. Instead the exhibition turned out as an overpriced playground with lights. Kids will enjoy the place, but I'd rather take them to a free playground.

For me, gave the museum the second star is the free documentary on internet. I would recommend watching the informational, 1.5 hour movie from the beginning instead of walking in part way through."
,,Would depend on exhibitions,4.0,,"Without doubt a great structure. Once inside there are glimpses at the greatness, but the experience is determined by what is on show. We managed to see the science and art collaboration and Escher, which were both awesome.

Definitely not a budget activity. S$100 for a family of 4."
,,Nice intuitive activities for the Kids!,4.0,,"Although a little costly, we paid for the year long season pass to the Future of us exhibitions. We thought this pass would allow us to visit the other galleries but we were wrong. The slide and drawings that can be scanned into the large display with all the big coloured balls and cubes were the highlights! Finally the light display at the end of the exhibition is a breath-taking display of light and sound!"
,,"Stunning building, tame shows",3.0,,"While the tickets cost as if this were a world-class museum, the exhibition space is limited and the shows are fairly tame, both in concept and execution. There is an effort to provide hands on experience for children, but sometimes that's coloring or playing with balls. The Art-Science connection could be drawn more profoundly. Really, the excellence of this museum is the exterior."
,,Enjoyable!,5.0,,"It took us a while to actually get here, but we loved it. One of the exhibitions was a bit weird, digital. My partner loved it as he is a techy, but I found that tedious. But the other exhibits were fabulous!"
,,ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,3.0,,Very small place and there are too few exhibitions. Ticket prices can be considered expensive and not value for money.
,,Pretty Interesting Museum,4.0,,"This museum was filled with amazing exhibitions that changes from time to time according to the staff there, and attracts a whole lot of tourists. Do plan your visit time and make your trip worthwhile! Weekends are superrrrrr crowded!!! Overall a good experience, look out for discounts or promotions for the tickets!"
,,Great Great way to kill a few hours!,5.0,,"We used the hotel discount to get the ticket for both exhibitions. Escher and Future. First exhibition was just fantastic, enough little tasks to keep you interested and fun enough that all ages can join in. The light room was spectacular. Escher exhibition upstairs was impressive when you realise how these pictures were made. Again more tasks to keep you interested. Throughly enjoyed the whole experience and felt it was great value for money."
,,Kids didnt want to leave!,5.0,,"Went for all 3 exebitions with the kids (6,9,11) but we stayed a long time at future would which is interactive and different and the kids loved it much more then the sceince center maybe because it was different. The nasa is very nice but they didnt have the patiance to read and learn all of the great information. The art galery took them by surprise and we spent there a long time too exploring the picture. It is pricely but worth it for our opinion. The place if highly welcomming and new. When you need a break or if your hungry so the marina shopps are just there outside. We spent there all day till they closed and recomend it for familys."
,,Beautiful Surrounding to Compliment Boring Exhibitions,2.0,,"Unless there are special exhibitions going on at the ArtScience Museum, chances are, there isn't much purpose for one to visit ArtScience Museum.

Besides having exhibitions, the space is also great for talks and forum sessions. Though there is a cafe at the museum, the food and drinks are rather pricey.

Only worth going if there are really special events going on over there."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"We inadvertently spent almost a whole day at the ArtScience Museum.
It was that good, enough to forego the so many other excellent attractions Singapore has to offer.

The cost was very reasonable, only S$30 pp for 3 brilliant exhibitions - Big Data, Escher and FutureWorld (where Art meets Science).

It was my teenage daughter's choice to visit the Museum and we both thoroughly enjoyed every second.
The building is gorgeous, the Museum shop is great and reasonably priced (and sells excellent, quirky Singapore souvenirs), the WiFi is free; and there is an on-site cafe if you need to eat.
The staff are friendly and polite.

Located right next to Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall and Hotel, and easily accessible via MRT it is easy to make a full day of visiting. Also, the Gardens by the Bay are within a 10 minute walk, linked via the Shopping Mall."
,,Future World Exhibit - perhaps the future will be different after all.,4.0,,"My local friend treated me to admission at the Future World exhibition at the Marina Bay ArtScience museum.

Went along this morning - wandered around the exhibit hall for 45 minutes or so - it is different - suitable particularly for kids as it is interactive - the walls and floors floated with animated lasers and lights...at one point I was walking over a whale.

There are hands on areas - one was a small city - you can change roads, railways and rivers - just like town planning and room had an animated table top which changed with hand motions.

Well recommended for an hours exploration."
,,Went there to see Japanese artists' masterpiece,4.0,,"Actually entrance fee is not cheap, can get resident discount though, this place was much better than expected. The ones are changing influenced by audience moves.
I thought these must be one of the direction of interactive human interface of IoT future entertainment. Worth to visit now."
,,FurtureWorld is so much fun,5.0,,"Despite the price (we're used to free museums in the UK) we absolutely adored the FutureWorld permanent exhibition at the Art Science Museum. I've never experienced such an interactive exhibition, and suitable for both kids & adults alike. Around every corner was something new to play with & be amazed by. I would go again in a heartbeat and recommend it for everyone with even a passing interest in technology, the environment or feeling immersed in a world of the future."
,,"Great museum at MBS, but pricey for its exhibits",4.0,,"Great museum at MBS, but pricey for its exhibits. However, it is worthwhile to visit it once in your life, and if you happen to be nearby."
,,NASA a human adventure exhibition,5.0,,A must go exhibition with young and old. Good collection of exhibits with a story line. Kept saying WOW to myself throughout :)
,,Good for kids,4.0,,Traveled Solo so may be dint enjoy the place but it would be a great place for kids who will enjoy the futuristic high-tech artworks and interactive digital games ...
,,A fun and interactive experience,4.0,,"Usually I don't find museums to be fun, they're usually intimidating and regular patrons like myself don't really find it entertaining unless you're an art major.

Where art meets science in Singapore - highly recommended - good for both adults and kids as it's got just the right balance of art, cool technology in a fun and interactive environment.

Be aware of the long queue on the weekends, book your tickets online for collection save yourself half an hour."
,,Must visit!,5.0,,"When art and science meet prepare yourself for the coolest installations! I went to see The Future World exhibition which was one of the most impressive installations I've seen. I like how the arts are interactive by using technology.

Colour a seahorse, scan it and in a few seconds see your drawings turn to life in a giant sea bed projectes on the wall. The last installation where you had to walk into strings of light was just breathtaking.

A great place to learn and have fun and get a really good shot for Instagram!"
,,FutureWorld exhibition is great for children,5.0,,"FutureWorld is quite an unusual exhibition, dark inside and each room features music and lighting. Often you can interact with the lighting itself, like chasing lizards and whales across the floor, or putting a plate in the middle of a table, and an apple or cake appears in the middle of it. Plus some drawing tables, inflatable balloons to play with, and lots of variety. It will take about 30 minutes to an hour to get around the FutureWorld exhibition, and well worth going. The other two exhibitions we saw - NASA and Escher - are interesting but not so great for the children (apart from the warped perspective box that you can stand inside, in the Escher exhibit, which is great)."
,,Great exhibition that will wow you,4.0,,Checked out the Future World exhibition at the Art science museum. It definitely blew my mind and I encourage you you experience this for yourself. I found out that Sands Casino members get 1 for 1 tickets. Just visit member services within the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands to sign up. Enjoy...!
,,Don't just look at this from the outside,4.0,,"This is an impressive building but not just from the outside!!
There are also some very good exhibitions - we visited the one on Escher's work - very much recommended too."
,,Really nice!,4.0,,I found it different and entertained for the kids. They can interact with everything and get different experiences. A little pricey because it's short but worth the visit!
,,Expensive but worth it,5.0,,It's a little museum. For each exhibition (two at the moment I visited) we have to pay 17 SGD. But it is worth it. What really makes this museum different from other museum is that their exhibition is interactive. Will definitely visit this museum again for another exhibition
,,Your experience will depend on what attractions are featured,4.0,,"Fantastic building but the enjoyment you get from your visit will depend on what attractions are on at the time, we saw future worlds which was good and my kids had fun but it was very quick and barely worth the money, any shorter and I would have been complaining."
,,Family Visit,4.0,,Visited with my 9 & 14 year old while in Singapore. Despite the 14 year old being a little older he still enjoyed the visit. It is rather short but suited us given we had a limited amount of time.
,,"Creative, Fun, Interesting",5.0,,Visited the ArtScience to see the Escher & FutureWorld exhibitions. The venue is spectacular: Fingers by an Israeli architect - with some Escher influences as I discovered. What a pleasure to see a well-run & engaging museum that has appeal for all ages. The FutureWorld interactive aspects were fabulous - integrating the physical and virtual world seamlessly & without fiddly interaction (colouring-in that turns into visually impressive 3-d models). Escher was also beautifully laid out with a good balance of information and the exhibits themselves. Left with a gratitude to all involved with arranging these exhibitions.
,,Good exhibitions,4.0,,"They do have a couple of good exhibitions in the ArtScience museum. The one I visited was the Esher exhibition, featuring all the artist's greatest work. I think it is definitely worth a visit once every few months to see what interesting exhibitions they have! Great for a date."
,,Future World,5.0,,"This is Art Science Museum collaborated with Team Lab
Very suitable too all age ppl to visit.
For family can bring children too, very suitable to let kid to inspiration their imagination too. more on visibility & art science to art performance."
,,A-Must-Go-Museum,5.0,,"Because i love visiting museum on each country that I've visited, i thought that i had to visit this museum and it was the best decision that i made. :D

I bought the entrance ticket online from Jakarta for S$16 to the Future World : Where Art Meets Science exhibition. I enjoyed 3 digital installations, Nature (100 Years Sea Animation Diorama and Flowers and People), Town (Grafitti Nature and Sketch Town), and Park (Universe of Water Particles and Light Ball Orchestra). more info, you can visit their website.

It was such an amazing experience. The installations were beautiful.

I also bought a Freeze-Dried Ready To Eat SpaceFood ""Enjoy your ice cream just as the Astronauts do"" for S$12"
,,"Futuristic interactive displays, great for kids too",4.0,,"The ArtScience Museum is located within Marina Bay Sands is full of interactive exhibits and displays. Bringing together the elements of art and science. I was there with my 5 year old and it was an amazing day spent together exploring and learning. It was a good attraction for the young one.
Some of the exhibitions include ""Flower and People"" where digital flowers bloom and change at your touch, a ""Sketch Town"" where the cars and building your draw become additions to this technological rendition of a town, and Light Ball Orchestra, a fantastical playpen filled with balls that change colour and chime when bounced against each other."
,,Escher exhibition,3.0,,"Honesty, i had expected to see more of his master pieces. It was still okay and quite educational for the kids with the different activities available that they could learn from. They liked making their own music and playing it through the little machine. Some classic master pieces were there and I was happy t see them on display."
,,A bit of a dissapointment,2.0,,"I am a bit dismayed because even though I am scientific, I just cannot mix art with it. I guess it is not my cup of tea. Just cannot get my head around it. I am sure many people might enjoy it."
,,Future World: Very Entertaining,5.0,,"I was amazed with the future world exhibition at ArtScience Museum. Although the area is relatively small, the advanced technology for every display is very entertaining for visitors of all ages. I love the Crystal World as it is really beautiful."
,,Great time at the Escher exhibition,4.0,,"First of all, the outside of this museum is pretty amazing. Once inside, everything is nice and modern. I only visited a temporary exhibition on Escher, so I can't speak for the whole museum, but I thoroughly enjoyed my time there.
Only drawback was that (like basically everything in Marina Bay) tickets were not cheap."
,,Must go!!!,5.0,,"This place is great for kids, a good change from theme parks and zoo's, gets their brain going with amazing concepts, only 2 hours to cover it which is excellent, highly recommend!"
,,A quick atop,3.0,,"We did the Esther tour. We were told the future tour was more geared towards children.
It took an hour. Was pleasant. Slow paced. Tickets cost about $12 as we got a discount being guests of the marina bay sands.
Nice little gift room at the end. It was an ok experience."
,,Small but great,4.0,,"So we tried to buy tickets online, but the website was very complicated and they add service fees so we just went in person despite the other reviews. Arriving at 11:15am on a Thursday, there was no one else in line to buy tickets! Win!

Each exhibit requires its own ticket. There is a SG$6.50 discount per ticket if you are a Marina Bay Sands member (presumably, from the casino). We weren't, but might be worth investigating.

Despite still having a lot of info on the website about the Big Data exhibit, its now closed. So as of Oct 2016, there is just the Escher exhibit and the Future World.

The staff nice to warn us that a school group just went into Future World, so we would be better off starting with Escher... we saw the massive school group leaving later and I was so happy they encouraged us to go elsewhere first.

The Escher exhibit is fantastic! There's a great array of work plus plenty of interactive exhibits too. We really enjoyed it.

As people who work in technology, we were less impressed with Future World. Its predominantly interactive and seem geared more towards children. The final piece with all the LED lights (which you see on all the promo graphics) was absolutely mesmerizing, but we breezed through a lot of the other parts.

All in all, though, a very good museum - at least for a couple hours."
,,Visit to Futur World Exhibition,5.0,,This is an amazing interactive display of lights and objects in every shape and colour. A must see for all families.
,,Don't miss while in Singapore,5.0,,"Wonderful place to visit. A place which combines entertainment with learning. Great for adults as well as kids. I have visited at least half a dozen times in the past few years. The latest being the ""Future World: Where Art meets Science"" exhibition which will be around for at least 3 years. Wonderful light installations and interactive models. We enjoyed it as well as our 5 year old. Not to be missed!"
,,Modern museum,5.0,,"As the name implies, this is a modern mudeum with temporary comtemporary axhibits. If you like classical or ancient art, this is not for you

As i prefer modern art, this is my favourite museum in singapore. I came today for the Escher show, which is grear. There are 2 other exhibits which i wasn't interested in

They don't have enough manpower at ticketing so the line is long and slow"
,,Pleasantly surprise,5.0,,"We went to the ArtScience Museum on our last day in Singapore, filling in time until we needed to go to the airport.
There were three exhibits, and we visited all three. Educational, interactive and lots of fun."
,,Escher exhibit is a must,5.0,,"While the Big Bang Data and interactive art and science exhibits were enjoyable, the MC Escher exhibit cannot be missed if you come to Singapore. The chronology and evolution of his work is captivating."
,,M.C. Escher Exhibition,5.0,,"On third stage of this Museum an Exhibition of M.C. Escher's oeuvrewas shown.
It's worth while to visit it and to admire the different drawings, lithographs and woodcuts. Take your time, you will need it.
Lowlight: ticketing procss is a disaster: the handle tickets like in last century; consequence: queing, waiting about 20 min..."
,,Art and Science Museum in the Lotus Flower,5.0,,"To start with, this is the most fascinating building from the outside it looks like a large lotus flower.

Depending on when you visit there the exhibits will change, however it is worth a visit just to see the building up close and go inside.

This is a fairly new building to Singapore, the staff were super friendly and helpful.

There is often more than one exhibit on at a time with special discounts if you go to more than one show"
,,Small museum,3.0,,Saw it all in two hours. Nothing spectacular. Visited it as part of the visit to Marina Bay Sands area.
,,SOOOO Cool!,5.0,,This was a great museum. I went there to just check it out and kill an hour. I ended up staying for three hours. It was so educational and had so much going on. Around every corner was something new and fascinating.
,,Something for everyone,5.0,,A beautifully presented and visually impressive facility both inside and out - hard not to like the lotus flower design. Conveniently located near to The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. We visited on a Friday when kids under 12 were free which did have the downside of making it busier. Purchased the All Access option so we're able to enjoy the three differnt exhibitions that were on show - Future World was amazing for the kids ( and big kids) with lots of amazing interactive components (highlights being the Town and Space sections). Kept our 10 and 7 year old occupied for more than an hour until we all got hungry. Big Bang Data was more content heavy but fascinating none the less. Really eye opening about the impact that and reach of technology in our world. And the M.C. Escher exhibition was also enjoyable with some hands-on activities for the kids too. Overall we spent a good 3+ hours at the Museum.
,,"Gorgeous building, empty shell",3.0,,"Love the lotus building, some great picture opportunities outside particularly with the lotus pond and reflecting mirror. But I've been disappointed with the exhibitions inside."
,,Journey to infinity was very nice!,4.0,,"There is a current show called Journey to Infinity at the museum which is worth seeing. We went for the guided tour for which you have to register. Every time we visit Singapore, we visit the museum, as there are different shows"
,,Ok...,3.0,,it was quite cool with the interactive screens but thats it..... might want to recommend gardens by the bay instead :)
,,Future world exhibition is great for (small) kids,4.0,,Th future world is playing with your imagination. The kids loved it. They were impressed by the art and it was set up in a interactive way. Due to the time slots it felt nice and quiet. Simply a beautiful exhibition!!
,,This is so cool!,5.0,,"My favorite museum to date. At the time we visited they were about to launch a new exhibit and my friends and I had the chance to take a sneak peek. Love the structure of the building itself and the dancing lights display (I forgot what it's called, sorry).

Geek paradise!"
,,Really pretty,4.0,,"Visited Future world, Big Bang data and Van Cleef & Arpels.

There was a lot of noise and kids running around at future world while at Big Bang data and Van Cleef & Arpels, it was very quiet and almost empty.

Future world was pretty fun with lots to see and do. The highlight was really the crystal universe at the end with lots of LED lights and effects. Future world is definitely a fun place for families with kids and also a great place for photo taking.

Big Bang data was okay. Nothing special.
Van Cleef & Arpels was really empty (we did not see anyone else when we visited) and pretty boring. Also, the security guards kept following us like we were going to steal something which was annoying yet amusing at the same time.

Overall, I would recommend everyone to only visit Future world. :)"
,,Playing to Singapore's strength,5.0,,"As fairly frequent visitors to Singapore from our home in Jakarta, we were becoming a bit jaded by watching the stilted performances of Singaporean theater groups and the fairly commercial overtones of even the supposedly boundary breaking modern art. So it was with a deep sense of satisfaction that we chanced upon these excellent displays of art and technology at the ArtScience museum. Talk about hands fitting gloves: all of that technomania suddenly came together in some really magnificent arts-meets-science installations that used minimalistic music, computer controlled lighting, and some really clever ideas to produce art that can only be called fun. The museum has three excellent shows going on. One is a ""sound and light"" display that is fun for all ages, epsecially the room where animal menageries respond to touch by turning tail and fleeing, or else transforming themsleves into another species. The second is a Big Data exhibition that, even if it doesn't quite answer the question of ""so what are all of these beautiful dsplays actually good for,"" at least makes for very impressiv maps and visualizations (and ots of envy). The third is a movie up on the 4th floor that should not be skipped. It's Werner Herzog intervieing data scientists on how data is changing the world, and it's really not to be missed. It takes about half a day to see all three museums, so if you go early you'll be out in time for lunch in the futuristic mall that the museum is part of, and then you can still walk down to the cloud forest and flowering gardens just a bit further down the bay to make a very satisfying day of it."
,,A photographers dream come true,5.0,,"Came to visit Future World with a friend in the last 2 hours (4-6pm) and time felt quite tight to get the ""picture perfect"" pictures we wanted, especially for the last installation where we experimented with different lights through accessing the website provided on our phone. Most visitors didn't seem to realize that they could control the light exhibit through experimenting with different ""stars"" or ""universe"" that teamlabs has created and stood there waiting for things to happen. Go on and have fun with the different designs!

We were quite confused at the ticketing online and bought the ticket on the day itself and everything turned out fine. Love that everything was interactive and were easily great set-ups for photo shoots. I would have given myself more time since some installations might crowd up with people (especially if you wanna take a photo that doesn't have others in it). You'll get to color and create, and feel like a child again. Sighted many families with their young kids enjoying. Young and old alike will love it! Have fun!"
,,Innovative & interactive,4.0,,"It is very IT & as a 63 yr old found it confronting as I didn't quite get it. However a day later I can appreciate it a whole lot more. Fantastic for children, incredible building & surrounds. A mind boggling experience.I will always remember it!"
,,Visit whilst here for the F1,5.0,,"We visited the museum on Sat 18th Sep mid morning. I'd looked up the exhibitions that were on & they seemed I interesting to us. Big Data & Future World. Entry was $25p.p. which was great value we thought. The building itself was incredible to be inside of and walk around.
The exhibitions were amazing! Future world was full of interactive exhibits (great for kids) & the Big Data was mind blowing! All about the use, future use, volume and fascinating take on data usage. We had an exceptional time & can not recommend this more highly. Both exhibits end late Oct I think so get in quick!"
,,Kids Friendly Museum,5.0,,"Our family paid a visit on Friday. There is free admission for young children every Friday. The indoor activities are wonderful - coloring and projecting onto the wall, indoor slide, and rolling fitness air balls. Also it has a beautiful light show - space - which made of thousands of LED flushing in rhyme to reproduce the imaginary stars. Highly recommended!"
,,"Excellent rainy day location, great for kids",4.0,,One exhibit very kid friendly with many interactive activities with colorful displays and interesting places to play and explore. Exhibit on Big Data fascinating for adults.
,,Permanent and Touring Exhibitions,3.0,,"The ArtScience Museum, which was opened by Singapore's Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, in 2011, has 6,000 square meters of space across 21 galleries.

It features both permanent exhibitions, like Leonardo da Vinci's Flying Machine, and touring exhibitions.

The futuristic building, designed by architect Moshie Safchie, is like an opening lotus flower."
,,Don't need kids,5.0,,"What a cool place. Although very expensive, we feel we got our money's worth. Two awesome displays - one that wa kid oriented but very adult friendly. I learned a lot and it was very cool. I also really liked the big data exhibit - I only wish you could
Purchase the information they used. A remarkable day and very exciting - so
Glad we went."
,,Excellent place,5.0,,"I guess whether it is good depends on the exhibitions featured. For my trip, it was Big Bang Data and Future World - both were interesting with lots of interactive exhibits."
,,Science up your afternoon,5.0,,"I've been here multiple times for multiple different exhibits and I've always enjoyed it. Although not the biggest museum, they make good use of the space provided for their exhibits so you can always spend a good 2 hours whiling away your time and enjoying the exhibits. Not to mention that its also cheap and very modern with wifi apps tailored for certain exhibits to make the experience abit more engaging. Worth going to every couple months."
,,Great display,4.0,,We saw the Future World and The Big Bang Data Exhibits. The interactive display was excellent and fun specially for kids. Didn't think I'd enjoy this but I did. Not so much with the Big Bang Data but still really enlightening and informative. Worth a visit.
,,Amazing exhibits,5.0,,"There's not much to the museum other than the paying exhibits on the ground floor - however the Future World exhibit that I took my 4yo to was amazing. Highly interactive and colourful. She spent, literally, hours playing with all the different facets of the museum."
,,Great for kids (and adults),5.0,,"The ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands engages the senses from the beginning. It provides wonderful examples of where science and art come together. It has the rare attribute of being able to stimulate in equal measure pre-school children right through to their grandparents. As an example, one of the early interactive exercises invites visitors to colour in various template images (trucks, buildings, spaceships, etc), then scan these and watch the creation move across the screen (with hundreds of others)."
,,Big data exhibition!,5.0,,At our first evening in Singapore we were close to Marina Bay Sands and found there even the ArtSciebce museum. We just had 1 hour to visit it but it was worth to go inside. The presentation of the thoughts and ideas were very interesting and well presented. One of my best stays in a museum.
,,A very good museum,5.0,,"we went to the museum and they had the Von Arpel collection of jewellery and gemstones, an data expo and a hands on experience expo as well, it was very interesting"
,,A 2-rooms museum?,1.0,,Between one room at the begining and an other at the end showing something you could expect from an 'artscience museum': a HUGE playground full with a thousand kids playing with all that has been made available to them. Lucky I came with my 2 year old daughter who enjoyed the slide. I would say otherwise it's a scam.
,,Futureworld/Big Bang Data: amazing!,5.0,,"Wow, we've seen quite some museums but this one blew us from our feet. Really amazing exhibition Futureworld, great for kids as well as for the parents! The interactive screens were fantastic, really enjoyed it. The exhibition Big Bang Data was also very good and food for thought... hmmmn what to do with your Facebook account.... The exhibition about Van Cleef jewelry was nice but didn't appeal so much to us. But wow we will surely remember this visit!"
,,Fun time for children,5.0,,A pleasurable place for both children and parents at reasonable price. In the 'Future World' children will appreciate a futuristic world of high-tech artworks and interactive digital games. Lots of fun there!
,,It is worth visiting this place,5.0,,"I felt like a kid there, I enjoyed interactive exhibition ""Future World"" very much. I loved appearing animals on the wall and Crystal Universe. The building of the museum is situated next to Marina Bay Sands hotel, so it is very easy to find it."
,,Creative and interesting exhibition with good price,5.0,,"With Sands card (free, you get the card right away when you apply), you get discount tickets to the museum.

Currently, one of the museum show is about creative art with science (forget the title of the exhibition). All the exhibits are innovate science with art. Great thing is, you can participate in exhibitions, which is very entertaining.

Highly recommended to family with children, or anyone who is interested in art and getting some fun."
,,A small and nicre museum,4.0,,"They had the Future World exhibit when I visited, since I was a hotel guest at Marina Bay Sands I also got a special discount. It was really enjoyable experience and I took some really good photos of the exhibit. I think they do change the exhibits on a constant basis, I think it would be better if you check their website to make sure which exhibit they have on."
,,Wonder of the world,5.0,,"The architecture of the building is awe inspiring. I loved the infrastructure and roamed around the building from near and far just to admire its beauty, From different angle the flower like building looked different and beautiful. The showcases inside the buildings are again another wonder where others have written. Let me just praise the building. While visiting the Marina Sands Bay, Helix Bridge, once can easily find it in the open space and enjoy the beauty. One has to buy ticket to go inside and enjoy the wonders of the world."
,,excellent exhibitions,5.0,,"Went there on National Day, 51% off on entry ticket!All three exhibitions were excellent, we were surprised really at how much we liked them.

'FutureWorld' was a digital world with colorful digital walls (you can color a drawing in crayons, scan it, and it gets added to the digital wall. nifty!).

'Big Bang Data' was about internet and the data we create. Had a nice history of data storage devices and visual presentation of data.

'Art of Science and Gems' was a gallery of exquisite jewellery with a theme of minerals its derived from. It was extensive - ranging from gold, diamond to turquoise and wood. Some avant-garde designs were also on display.

We were impressed with the variety on display at this museum. Looking forward to new exhibitions and will go there again."
,,The Future World Exhibition,5.0,,"Just visited the Art Science Museum and loved the exhibition of the Future World. Many activities for adults and children. Family friendly, interesting art technologies with a vision and good for 1 hour."
,,Van Cleef & Arpels Exhibit Rocks!,4.0,,"This is probably the finest jewelry exhibit I've seen, and we have seen many around the world, including the Smithsonian in DC. I really had no idea of the dedication that Van Cleef and Arpels has to handmade, one of a kind art jewelry. Much of the jewelry is displayed to allow you to see the back as well as front of each piece. Thoughtfully laid out to avoid crowding, the collection is surprisingly large and encompasses an assortment of work from a butler's bell to tiaras. Short films about their artisans make the exhibit more personal. We did not visit the second (unrelated) exhibit as the price more than doubled--my only complaint. This exhibit is over on August 14. A must see if you appreciate exquisite original artisan handcrafts."
,,"Worth visiting, delivers a ""wow"" factor",5.0,,"There were 3 exhibits available during our visit last August 2: Future World, The Art and Science of Gems, and Big Bang Data. The museum offers admission to single exhibit, double, and all -- something that caters to different people's interests. My beau and I got the all-access tickets. I especially love how sharp, clean, and simple the museum is as a whole. The exhibits are well thought of (with good lighting in paths leading to each.) The security and staff are also approachable and well-groomed. Most of the digital art awed me. My rating are as follows:

Ambiance and surrounding: 5
Ventilation: 5
Staff: 5
Exhibits (I especially liked the Gem and Big Bang Data exhibits): 5
Kid-friendly (depends on exhibit): Future World - 5
Themes (Very modern, to me is good): 5
Educational contribution: 5"
,,A Must Visit,5.0,,"Stitched together with other offerings for the ""integrated resort"" concept that won Sands one of the 2 coveted casino licenses in Singapore, the Art Science Museum could have been forgiven if it had presented run-of- the mill-kind of exhibitions in this obligatory space. On the contrary, it has exceeded itself in its recently opened ""Future World"" permanent exhibition. This exhibition alone makes the museum a wiorthy visit. Divided into easily navigable themes-nature, park, town and space, each interactive zone stimulates and provokes thought on the interaction between msn and his environment.
Eminently appealing to kids for the superior visual and digital technology, the exhibition speaks to adults too as a place for (not too quiet) reflection on one's place under the sun.
It is best to go when the crowds are less to fully appreciate all that ""Future World"" has to offer. We booked the 10 am ('first）slot and that was great because by the time we finished at noon, the place was packing it in. The 8 year old in our group enjoyed it so much she declared that she wanted to come to Singapore to work here!
For its oricing, it offers great value for money. An adult ticket costs S $14 and for that, on Family Fridays, you get to bring 4 children up to the age of 12, free. How much better can it get?"
,,FUTURE WORLD EXHIBIT- Wondrous and Highly Recommended,5.0,,"I run an art studio and rarely recommend any exhibits to my students as the art in the past years, have been getting more and more depressing, filled with complains or coming from a ''crazy'' place of the mind. This is not a rejection of that kind of art but just our personal preference. Visual art, just like music, can influence and affect our emotional and inner well being. I encourage art that is uplifting and the on-going exhibit, FUTURE WORLD is one of such.
Totally surprising and an absolutely wondrous joy to experience. This exhibit is not only for children but especially so for adults in this busy and fast paced world. Interact and immerse yourself fully with each and every piece to benefit from the sensations it creates in you.
Best to go when there is less crowd.
A magical journey created by a group of Japanese artists."
,,"Amazing, stunning, beautiful exhibition",5.0,,"I went to this museum, and the first thing i realised was this is a very modern museum. It was faaaarrrr from boring and perfect for children. I visited Future World and Big Data exhibition. They usually have package so it will be cheaper. They also have a discount for student and Singapore resident. All you have to do is show them your student card or your Singapore identity card. In future world, you can see the light show. My favourite one is the colouring part. Where you can colour the drawing they gave you and scan them. After that, your drawing will shows in the big screen in 3D! It was super cool! Big data may not very suitable for children. But the exhibition is interesting and unique. They have a huge pile of photos shown the number of photos uploaded in internet in 24 hours. This museum amazed me! Unfortunately, the exhibition is not permanent. So, you should visit this museum ASAP!"
,,Tranquil Technology. Arresting Art.,5.0,,"I've always associated technology with speed, efficiency and stress. But The Future World exhibit proved me wrong. Upon entry this exhibit immediately transported me into a dreamlike world. The lights and sounds combined to create an effect that enveloped me into a cocoon of wonderment. My description will not do it justice, you must step in to experience it.

The combination of lights, sounds, music, touch, movement effectively create a tranquil and beautiful world which I found hard to let go.

We had fun coloring our own spaceship and watch our creation come to life on the huge screen.

The Crystal Universe is a sight to behold. Watch as millions of lights change colors, rhythms, directions & speeds to sync with the music and be lost in your own world. I could stay there the whole day...

And, make sure you don't miss the room with the ocean waves... ahhh...

The Big Bang Data Exhibit is very informative but a tad too geeky for my interest.

The Van Kleef and Arpels The Arts and Science of Gems Exhibit features lots of luxurious gems and jewelry. If you are into such luxuries, you are in for a treat. For my party and I, the place pales in comparison to the Future World Exhibit.

Be prepared to spend at least an hour in EACH exhibit. Actually, you need 2 hours to totally enjoy Future World."
,,Kids will enjoy the FUTURE WORLD museum,4.0,,"Went there to spent a afternoon after a late breakfast at Ritz Carlton, just 5 min walk.

Bought ticket for all 3 exhibitions, I only recommend the FUTURE WORLD part. Don't go to the VanCleef & Arpels unless you are jewelry fans or the BIG BANG DATA unless you are IT guy .

Spent 2 hrs there with the kids. Had fun."
,,Future World,5.0,,"Love love love this exhibition!! My son , he is 6,5yo had so much fun at the interactive displays through out this exhibition. From playing with the lights, get his colored UFO and sharks come alive on the screen, to design your own digital hopscotch path. It's a fascinating mix of art and tech, I my self really enjoy the visit.. The ticket price is very reasonable, it's even better if you are a member of MBS (MarinaBaySands) .. You get a buy 1 get 1 free ticket price. I paid $23 for 2 adults and 1 happy kid Btw, you can apply for the membership for free at the designated booth at the mall, but u have to be 21yo to apply.
Last year I went to the Dinosours exhibition , and again it was great..my little guy had a blast, and couldn't stop talking about it for the next month
I highly recommend this venue, especially the current exhibition of Future World for family with young kids or art science lover in general. I even saw many teenagers really had fun taking pictures (wefie and selfie) with the very stunning and cool displays"
,,Worth the money,5.0,,"For people on a strict budget for Singapore trying to decide where to spend your money, this is the place. Went to three great exhibitions and was not quite finished for closing time (4 hours later)."
,,One of best things we did,5.0,,"Mum, Dad, 2 shopaholic late teen/early 20s daughters - next to the zoo this was the best thing we did. Air con always a winner, amazing displays, not too crowded. Fabulous"
,,Stunning crystal universe display,4.0,,"The highlight for me was the scintillating Crystal Universe. Immerse yourself by walking through this 3D technological masterpiece created from 170,000 suspended LED lights, giving the illusion of stars moving in space. Choose a time to visit when there are no large school groups present though as it is distracting to have hordes of kids racing around and blocking your view of the exhibits. Lots of interactive displays for young and old alike. Not your usual museum full of stuffed animals"
,,Future Fantastic,5.0,,We went to visit the FutureWorld exhibition on the recommendation of a friend and it was a truly spectacular experience. The impressive exhibits were all compromised of interactive computer animations. These included jungle scenes projected on the floor where you could draw your own animals which are then scanned in and become part of the display. There is a city and underwater scene where you can also scan in your drawings which become part of the display. Other exhibits included a large ball pit full of beach ball sized balls that changed colour when they are touched or moved. It's very hard to describe how amazing this exhibition is but I would class it as a must see for anyone in Singapore no matter what your age. Our one year old enjoyed it as much as we did.
,,Good place but need some more rules,3.0,,"Been there for 2nd time and I really like topic they show.

My main problem is the customer nor really care the topic and are ther almost only for take there selfies in front of each projection
Very annoying I suggest to let phone and camera at th entrance for let people's really enjoy the tour and not just take a pics with out care what they see"
,,Cool place!!! #WhenArtMeetsScience,5.0,,This place is for all ages. What I loved most was we were able to draw and watch our sketches moving on the screen. I love everything about it. ☺️
,,Rewarding!,4.0,,"Interesting place to visit! Very interactive and fun, surprisingly fit for kids. Big Data exhibition that we happened to catch was a highlight for us. Museum souvenir shop is expensive but full of great staff you won't find anywhere else."
,,Stunning exhibits combining art and science,4.0,,"We were really impressed with the Art Science Museum. An innovative combination of informative exhibits delivered through artistic and interactive experiences. Engaging for the children and inner children, and educative without overkill. Highly recommended."
,,Enormously Interesting Museum - Friendly Staff,5.0,,"Chose to visit this museum late afternoon, but pleased to find out that closing time was not until 7 pm on Thursdays. As is the case, foreigners and Singaporeans pay different rates to visit the museum, but you can also get a 2 for 1 deal with a Sands Card - just stop by the casino, sign up and the card is in your hand. Just stroll by before you go to the museum to avail of this benefit - no gambling required.

Chose to see two of the attraction / exhibits. The Art of Science and Gems. An amazing display sponsored by Van Cleef and Arpels of Paris, and in conjunction with a museum in Paris. The exhibition shows the geological formation of minerals, and the requirements for the gemstones to form well below the earths crust. It looks firstly at diamonds, then at numerous precious and semi precious stones. There are displays of both the natural form of the stones and also cut stones in jewellery pieces. There is an excellent video showing how jewellery is made and how gem stones are classified. I was truly amazed by the jewellery on display - from pieces made for European and Arab royalty to Van Cleef and Arpels designer pieces. Photography is allowed without flash.

The second gallery we visited was that of Future World: Where Art Meets Science. It was interesting and there were many animated displays - of the sea and tides. Of light and of children's attractions and interactive play stations. They never had anything like this when I was a child. Appreciated a rest on the floor and watching the river go by - changing sky, rocks etc. At the end are numerous light curtains which afford great photographic experimentation. Amazing - as the lights keep varying in brightness the opportunities expand.

What a wonderful afternoon out."
,,Outstanding exhubition,5.0,,"Before you read more: wear warm clothes when visiting. This museum is amazing, but cold like a fridge. The architecture of the building itself is very original. Have a look at the lotus flowers blooming around the museum, and you will recognize the design. The building is shaped like flower. I loved the Van Cleef and Arpels exhibition, and I was really surprised how few visitors were there. Tickets are cheaper if you combine to of three exhibitions, one full price ticket gives a free ticket, so in my opinion it's very cheap. Only negative remark- the cash desks were very slow."
,,Exquisite Jewellery & Crystals at Van Cleef & Arpels Exhibit,4.0,,"Choosing to visit on a rainy weekday gave us a beautifully, relaxed and crowd free experience to savor the exquisite Jewellery, crystals and gems in the Van Cleef & Arpels exhibit.

The show was beautifully set up with the jewels and other exhibits displayed in clear tubes, spheres and cubes so you can get up close and view many of the exhibits from all sides. And photography was allowed as long as no flash was used.

Security was posted everywhere - as can be expected - but were unobtrusive.

We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves oohing and ah-ing over the collections. The free souvenir program handed out at the entrance is a beautiful keepsake. Thank you ArtScience Museum for the gift.

I do, however, have 1 piece of feedback to ArtScience Museum. I logged on to buy tickets online but abandoned my cart as the process asked for too much information in my opinion.

As a visitor, I want to buy tickets as a guest. I do not want to register for, or need an account. A mobile number is useful for you to contact me should shows be cancelled, but not every visitor will have a mobile. Also, why is it mandatory for me to provide my email, my date of birth and my passport number? How is it relevant to my buying tickets to view an exhibit. And why should I trust you with such private, confidential information in this age of cyberattacks and hacks?

In contrast, when I bought tickets at the counter - running the gamut of standard visitor, standard student, local adult and local senior citizen - all you were interested in was my credit card. At no point were we asked for IDs, not even for local and senior citizen tickets which were at a discount.

Are you trying to deter online ticket buyers? Please consider your online UX. Thank you."
,,Remarkable Interactive Museum Experience - Go by end of August 2016,5.0,,"This wonderful museum is a great weekday experience.
The weekends are very busy and you will compete with lots of family groups. I visited all 3 special exhibitions and they were uniformly brilliant. The Future World exhibit was wildly interactive and colorful, and the VanCleef & Arpels jewelry and mineral exhibition was informative and stunningly presented. The best of the three was the Big Bang Data exhibit, and it should not be missed by anyone who uses any form of digital media. What a thought provoking series of informative presentations. You will never think about your smart phone and/or your privacy in the same way after visiting this exhibit. Also, if available, buy the book because it is not available on line and you will want it for future reference."
,,Nice exhibits,3.0,,"We arrived early to a large queue. While pricey we chose the Future and Big Data electing to bypass the gem collection. Turns out the huge crowd was all families with young children. The Future is geared toward them with only two rooms that would please adults/teenagers (butterfly hologram room and Optic Fiber Jungle Light display).

Big Data was quite stimulating and fun. We were in and enjoyed the whole exhibit to ourselves. The teens really enjoyed it stopping to read and explore everything.

It was enjoyable but plan so you can skip peak crowds."
,,Lynlim,4.0,,Interestingly the colouring activities where you able to scan and appeared on walls or floors depending on what you choose are so creative. children and adults too can have lots of fun. Different rooms shows arts of the future where photo takings are so enjoyable
,,A marriage of art and science made in heaven,5.0,,"Shaped like a giant lotus flower, the ArtScience Museum is a superb demonstration that art and science have much in common. We greatly enjoyed the section on climate change (though the message was probably lost on the children because it had no narration). But this was followed by a section of art and city planning that was designed especially for the children, giving them a change to plan cities hands-on. Our observation was that they were having an entertaining time of it. And the final exhibit, on light and space was mesmerising, and kept us enthralled for 15 minutes. Sadly, we did not have time for the Gem Exhibition or the Digital world, but would have enjoyed them if we had more time. One annoyance, common to many Singapore attractions, is that visitors are charged more, often significantly more in the case of seniors, than locals. We can understand the reasoning, but also heard a lot of grumbling from visitors. It would be a good idea to have a short brochure explaining the policy, in multiple languages, as a way of minimising potential complaints."
,,Art Science Museum Never Disappoints,5.0,,"My wife wanted to see the Van Cleef & Arpels: The Art and Science of Gems exhibit at the Singapore Art Science Museum during our recent Singapore holiday. I was worried. She may find something there that will make me steal the Crown Jewels if I am to make her happy. Or it could be an agonizing wait for me. But as it turns out there were two other exhibits, Future World, and Big Bang Data. Splendid! We can split the chores of liking and looking at them. I ended up follow in her.

The last time we were there, it was the respective exhibitions of Vincent Van Gogh and Andy Warhol that were mounted.

I found the Future World engaging but more so for the children who are allowed explore and question, wonder and weave tales that will define their worlds years from now.

Big Bang Data gave the jolting reality that the world is actually running of meta data in 1's and 0's translated into algorithms that build and recreate, that I wonder is in the end humans are the outsiders to artificial intelligence?

What blew our minds was the exhibit of the artistic and unique jewels created by the Maison of Van Cleef and Arpels. The actual or replica copies were breathtaking in their intrinsic ornateness and systematic order that all the sparkles and glitters are as much about the marrying of materials from precious (diamonds, emerald, rubies, etc.) to semi-precious stones (quartz, agate, malachite, corals) or even wood, as the engineering that went with each piece of bespoke jewelry. The detail and the craftsmanship, artistry and innovation have remained the trademark of a piece of art with many functions, as tiara, or an a necklace.

The Arts Science Museum lived up to its word as an outstanding venue that educates as much as it entertains. It brings science to its impactful simplicity with wider consequence, and curates art or artistic expression that opens new perspective. We learn more of ourselves and our surroundings, in the end.

My wife and myself took with us not any of the baubles exhibited but the book catalogue of the Van Cleef and Arpels exhibition and plenty of sobering thoughts about what finery and ornaments say about their wearers."
,,Unexpected great!,5.0,,"Me and my bf are not fans of museum, but I can say that ArtScience is the great one. We visited Future World and Big Bang Data exhibition. Both of them are presented by perfect combination of art and science. Future World exhibits a ""high-tech"" interactive digital playground while Big Bang Data invites us to see datas from different perspective. We never expected that museum can't be more amusing and inspiring like this!"
,,Future World Exhibition is excellent for kids,4.0,,"Right next to Marina Bay Sands, easy walk from MRT.

Future World exhibition is excellent, very interactive. Would best suit 3-12yrs but this is our third visit as a family and I still love it just as much as the kids. Easy to spend 1-2hrs there. I have kids 2.5yrs and 6.5yrs and they both love it, there is so much to see and do, they are fully occupied.

Had lunch at food court at Marina Bay Sands mall, reasonably priced, good food, quick. There is no cafe at the museum (that we've found).

Big data exhibition is also well worth a visit but better for teenagers/adults. Not good for toddlers or young kids."
,,Gem Exhibition,5.0,,"The museum is divided into 3 sections. We only had time to view the gem exhibition which is only on display for a limited time. A short film shows how jewellery is made from the designers doing the initial drawings thru the different stages till item finished. Jewellery of all types on display, much has been loaned or donated by famous people throughout the world. Air conditioned, a welcome respite from outside heat."
,,Great option to spend some time,4.0,,"Marina bay is one of the attractions in Singapore. I didn't expect that the museums was so good. We got into to expositions. One was the big data and the other one was about the worlds future. Both of them are amazing. There is a place to visit. It doesn't matter if you are by your self, with your couple or with you family. You will really enjoy this interactive museum."
,,Really Interesting Based on Exhibits Shown,4.0,,You have to pick your exhibition being shown but all in all this place is pretty good. I was lucky to see a pretty good exhibition there and the building is certainly different - more a display space then a museum.
,,Rip Off,1.0,,"Totally waste of time and money! Visited with girl (9) and boy (12), they could not get out quick enough! An other family asked as we went out how it was. At least we saved them the money:)"
,,Worth the money and time.,5.0,,"Went for the June exhibition, it's pretty amazing especially the lights!
The place is clean and also their staff are all very friendly to greet you and guide you.
The toilet there is clean as well.
Here is a place to relax you brain and take as much photo as possible."
,,Great landmark. Spacious park facing the water. Modern. Always enticing and world class!,5.0,,"We always put ArtSience Museum in our family itinerary everytime we are in Singapore.
They are mostly packed with exhibitions and some are really awesome, eg the LHC (Large Haldron Collider) last Nov2015. Too bad we missed it :( my son (then 12y.o) was raved about it but timing was off. We didn't make it to Singapore on the month.

The point is, we always check what's in the museum website whenever we plan to go to Singapore.

Afterwards or beforehand we usually spend a time to take a bite in the nearby vegetarian Mediterranean small restaurant serving healthy and delicious food and to stroll in the mall. We usually gain a good and productive 2-3 hours moment there for the boy."
,,Can get crowded and affects the experience,3.0,,"I only went to the Future World exhibition that was said to be well suited for kids. I brought my 4.5-year old, excited about all the kids-friendly activities I had read about...

However, the place is a little small, and when there are loads of children (as there was when I was there it being the last day of the school holidays), it can get a little overwhelming and I think that to accommodate so many children, some features had to be cut away, such as the self-design feature of the hopscotch, which was one of the original highlights of the exhibition...

I think the staff was also overwhelmed and I find many of them, sadly, to be quite grouchy. Better trained staff who are more children-friendly and understanding might be better? They shushed the kids going down the slide and seemed to just be policing the area rather than helping guests to enjoy the experience. This is my first time there so it's just based on my one experience which might not be accurate...

Other interesting activities include the colouring of vehicles/sea creatures which when scanned, go up onto the screen. While some activities are intuitive, not all are - like the dragon that comes out to be attacked by the aircraft - and I feel more instructions/engagement with staff could help. Another activity was the Table of Little Men, which was very interactive too. The colourful balls which my daughter pushed across with great excitement was also a highlight for her...

Overall I spent about 2.5 hours there (out of which at least half an hour was spent going up and down the simple slide haha)...Don't think I could do much longer..."
,,A must visit for small kids!,4.0,,"We went there with a 8 and 11 year old. There are loads of fun and educational activities for small kids till about 7-8. There was an influx of school groups even while we were there. The exhibition on big data with several installation art was thoroughly enjoyed by us.
The area outside the museum provides a relaxed open seating and many food joints in the adjacent mall area. Overall, a thumbs up!"
,,First Visit,4.0,,"Ticketing was slow and pricing was confusing. We had the Rewards membership card and there was a one for offer for all categories except students. Counter staff were overwhelmed and exasperated as they tried to explain pricing policies over and over again. Apparently the one for one offer came with many conditions and was just a bit cheaper.
The Future World Exhibits were great. My kids did not want to leave. Crystal lights were so beautiful. We love designing our own vehicles and sea creatures. You simply scan them and see them animated and projected on the walls. They enjoyed playing with the giant lighted cubes and balls. Great fun.
The Big Bang Data exhibit was nothing to rave about. We simply walked through.
The jewellery exhibits were not really exciting.
But overall we enjoyed ourselves."
,,Must visit Future world!,5.0,,"This place is for all age group, specially for the kids. Every exhibition is worth watching, it's like a digital universe. The best part is the last one called Space. its mesmerizing!"
,,Go while the current exhibition is on.,4.0,,"The exhibition at the moment is great. My kids age 5&7 loved it and didn't want to leave.

Lots of creative play and fun things to do to entertain the kids. Colouring in printing scanning seeing imagines on wall. Making of 3D object that they coloured in. Amazing really, really good.

Don't miss it. Would go back"
,,The palm of Buddha,4.0,,"o Creative concept brought to life by the architect who visioned and designed this in the line of ""Buddhas-palm"". It is said to bring prosperity to the country of Singapore. Hurray!
i. Although I have been there couple of times myself, I'm writing a review for all when I was invited to witness the pre-launching of Panasonic's Future of Technology presentation. I also visited it prior to that for the Large Hadron-Accelerator. Let's get to it.
o Being around MBS, this art science museum takes on the high-class and elegant stance while educating the public in different disciplines.
o The water lily ""pond"" was modern and pretty. It does not look out of place and the word of Art Science Musuem is very evidently presented there, with confidence. You've got to take a picture there!
o The vicinity of the art science Musuem is the heart beat of the Bayview of Singapore. First timer will go ""wow!"" in every way they turn.
- Ground floor and second floor are usually paid exhibition. The first is your lobby and the third floor is free for all most of the time because it briefly promotes the history of the building design and it also plays documentary-liked film at a scheduled time daily.
o The paid exhibition is always very captivating. From the collider to the Panasonic ones, they have done a marvelous job in setting a high standard of a professional art and science Musuem should be like. The design of the exhibition, the color and contrast, the description and history are all excellently done.
o Amazing cool looking see-through glass lobby!
x The pond is quite dirty and filled with moss because the water does not flow.
x The water lily gets blown to the edge a lot of times, leaving big part of the pond exposed. The green does not look very balanced.
x The interior of the Musuem looks a bit run down, especially the public places."
,,"If this is the future, we're in trouble...",2.0,,"Tried to book to go with family. The online system is one of the most basic and user unfriendly systems I have seen, which effectively made it impossible to book online. The other option was to call. So I tried. When I eventually got through, I was put on hold for 5 minutes (because apparently buying tickets at the dedicated line whose sole purpose is to sell tickets is an unusually complex procedure) before eventually being told that they can't sell family tickets by phone - they can only sell up to two individual tickets, so I would have to chance it and turn up at the relevant time. Frankly I don't think any exhibition can be good enough to make me want to pay people who are determined to make it so hard to give them money!"
,,An underrated place of Singapore,5.0,,"Pls visit this place even if you have crossed your childhood/teens..the future world, big bang data is too good..yeah at times u will feel data overload, but its real fun.. advise to take a package combo..the gems one isnt that great or may be we were too exhausted after the two shows.."
,,Changing galleries of interest,5.0,,"The galleries in here keep switching all the time, and so far I have not been disappointed by the variety of art and photography installations or galleries, and they all are top-notch."
,,Great exhibitions for the whole family,4.0,,"There were three exhibitions going on when we visited, one involving Jewelry, and two involving art and colours and another about data.

Kids enjoyed it and the adults did too. The Wife of course, loved the Jewelry exhibition and I found it all rather fascinating. Highly recommended."
,,Boring,1.0,,"Found it very boring, paid $55 for me and my husband. Was not a lot there for us. They had a kids interactive area which was great for children. Couldn't wait to get out. I would give it a miss. Save your money on this one."
,,Free Ticket for Entry,5.0,,"I went there for free as Singapore was celebrating national day on that time. Most of the residents and visitors are allowed to enter into museum for free of charge although there was a very long queue.
There have various type of exhibition hall as well as gallery to see. Design and architecture are really amazing and inspired by Lotus."
,,Different themes - must like museums,4.0,,"In May 2016, I went for the Future World, Big Bang Data, and Van Cleef & Arpels gem collection exhibit.

Future World was oriented more towards kids. There are some activities they can do to occupy their time.

Big Bang Data is more for adults. Basic premise is how information is collected and used. Some sections have kaleidoscopic visuals and sounds, which is just there to make the place appear cool and futuristic (nonsense data/sounds).

Van Cleef & Arpels showcases lots of very nice jewelry and gemstones. As a man you may not be interested in shiny things, but be careful bringing your (female) significant other as they may spend more time than you (man) care to wait, haha."
,,Very cool looking architecturally,4.0,,"It is worthwhile to make a visit to the museum; even if just to spend some time walking around the outside area to view the structure and landscape. The exhibition area inside is clean and new, with multiple exhibits; that can be paid for individually or as a combination. The tickets are a little pricey for what you get; but the overall experience was a good one, and I recommend it for Singapore visitors."
,,Impressive,4.0,,"Chose to go the whole hog and buy a combined ticket for all three exhibitions. The building itself is spectacular from the outside with a pleasing counterpoint of a massive lily pond at the base which offset the pillars supporting the bowl of the museum's main structure. Nice mirror sculpture near main entrance by Kapoor. Exhbition halls themselves were beautifully constructed and lit, with the modern Future World exhibition showcasing some simply impressive interactive displays of visual and acoustic technology. As a first time (and probably only time) visitor I did not get the feel for the buildings extreme architecture when inside it, which was a shame, as one tended to be directed into darkened exhibitions rather than encouraged to explore the building from within."
,,A magical morning out for children and adults who got to act like children :O),5.0,,"We went to the Van Cleef & Arpels: The Art and Science of Gems exhibition and Future World: Where Art Meets Science exhibition. The Artscience Museum itself is a beautiful building. We were welcomed warmly by all staff members. The Future World exhibition was stunning and so much fun. We loved watching the children interact with all the displays and despite being adults we jumped in to the activities as well. Sliding down the big slide and colouring in. The crystal LED chamber was magical. You could sit all day and watch that and be mesmerised. It was nice to leave the adult world behind for a couple of hours and return to spontaneous fun and childlike awe as the exhibition unfolded in front of you. After this we went upstairs and saw many a stunning item of jewelry in the Van Cleef & Arpels Exhibition. The jewelry was displayed beautifully and carefully guarded by some very attentive security gentlemen lol :O) There was a significantly higher proportion of females in attendance than men, possibly with men thinking this was a ""girly"" type exhibition. This was not exactly the case as there were really interesting displays of the different types of gemstones, where they come from and how they were formed. And so after spending an hour marveling over jewelry that is unlikely ever to end up in our bracket of affordability we left the museum very happy with our experience. We can't wait to see what exhibitions are on next time we are in Singapore!"
,,Fascinating and highly educational.,5.0,,"My wife and I visited this museum. They had three exhibitions. The first of these was about how art and science were linked. This was done by several interactive displays and digital artworks.

It was visually stunning and an excellent educational tool for children.

The second exhibition concerned the use of data gained from the internet. It showed how it was collected and how it is used by various governments/organisations. This is a truly mind blowing exhibition and really makes you think every time you log onto the internet.

The third exhibition was about gemstones and the work of famous Paris Jewellers Van Cleef and Arpels. Some truly stunning pieces of jewellery were on display alongside raw gemstones and explanations on how they are formed. An interesting combination of natural history, geology and art and design.

The displays were very well designed and interesting. I would highly recommend this museum."
,,Great exhibits over the last few years,5.0,,"For me, this has been the most consistently interesting museum in Singapore over the last few years. There have been some really fantastic and interactive displays such as The Art of the Brick, Dreamworks and Di Vinci: Shaping the Future. I always look forward to what they are planning next"
,,Fun Art & Science Learning for Children,4.0,,"I was curious about this place since it was first opened. But the one chance I managed to get in was during the Dreamworks/The Deep and the bonus SG50 exhibition. We were thrilled to get in. My 9-year-old son was excited about both exhibitions. This place is fun for children with changing interactive exhibitions that put kids in mind (looking at the height of the displays and the art & craft stations available at the time).

Get the all-access, so you can browse everything without worry. Personally would spend the whole day here, or at least until early afternoon, if you visit all three exhibitions. Don't rush yourself here because this is interesting for the whole family (although it may depends on theme as well). There is elevator and the whole building is cool with AC, which can be too cold for some (me), so bring extra layers.

To reach this place, you can either take MRT to Bayfront or alight at Promenade and walk along the Helix Bridge."
,,Enjoyable; Impressive & Events for Children,4.0,,We went to ArtScience Museum and was blown away by its theme and also activities especially tune for children and parents alike. My daughter enjoys the colorful giant balls and the slide. We are impressive on the lighting theme towards the end. It was a really good event. Service was good too in the front counter.
,,"Wonderful, wonderful Future world!",5.0,,"Imagine you colour a fish on paper, write name on it and after few seconds you can see it swimming in water on a huge LCD screen. Or imagine you coloured a rocket and you see it launching on a big LCD screen! Interesting right. We actually did that!

Architect marvel, beautiful white coloured, Lotus shaped building stands near MBS hotel increasing its beauty. We book the tickets online from sistic website and collected tickets from their collection center (nearly every major mall has it, collection center list is there while you book) Or you can buy at the entrance also but it can have huge queue. You can choose time slots while booking tickets and should go at that time, good way to manage the crowd.

Bayfront mrt is the closest to this place, from where you can walk to the exhibition hall.

The Future exhibition is divided in multiple section as you enter. Space, Nature, etc. Every section tries to portray possibilities of future.
There are huge circular table where sun is shining, cloud is floating and it is raining. It is interactive and you can catch the rain. Or you can block the way of miniature people running and they will change the way. Very interesting! One section highlights the rise in sea level due to growing urbanisation and pollution.

For me, the best section was colouring car and fishes and then scanning it with 2D and 3D printer and watching it in big interactive LCD screens. Sat with kid did lot of colouring and it was spend some good quality time. My son enjoyed interactive floor too. It is a must visit with kids of all the ages!"
,,Depends on what exhibits are there,4.0,,"The digital exhibit made this visit worth it! We went with two 7year olds and a baby. Baby and adults were both impressed and had so much fun with exhibit.

We coloured images and had them scanned and watched them come to life on a projected wall, played with brightly coloured cubes and balls, and were wowed by a ""star"" light piece.

Helpful tip: always search what promotions they are having on their website before going. We got everyone in our 12 member group in for a ridiculously low price."
,,Awesomely cool exhibitions,4.0,,"The museum is a very interesting attraction for young children. During our visit, we found that the exhibits were interactive and engaging. We spent about 2 hours inside. At the souvenir shop, have a go at the astronaut's deep frozen ice-cream packs. They are worth paying for the experience. I would have never known how it tasted, if not for my visit to this museum."
,,Wonderful exhibition,5.0,,"This museum is right on the water, outside of Marina Bay Sands shopping centre. The building is very impressive and depicts a hand. The exhibition we went to was Van Cleef and Arpels Gems and it was amazing and the items were shown in a wonderful art space. This building is over 3 or 4 floors and would be great for any type of exhibition"
,,Future world exhibition,5.0,,"Had a wonderful time at this exhibition where art meets science.

Lots of interactive installation and colorings for kids and adults to do.

The slide is fun and the interactive colorings that u get to scan and went to the big screen after is just fun fun fun!!!

Pricing is reasonable for 2 adults 2 kids $44 (oversea visitors) $35 (Singapore residents)"
,,In Singapore for only a few days - but well worth using time for the Future World exhibition.,4.0,,"We decided on just one of the exhibitions as our time in Singapre is short. Wish we had been able to do the jewelry too! Take your time in the Future World exhibition, and you will be well rewarded. Do sit down on the bean bags to watch the complete sea/island cycle, and you will realise how powerful the work is. The underwater scene is great fun to do, and the light/space experience is mesmerising. Could have stayed watching it even longer than we did!"
,,Monthly exhibit to entice you,4.0,,"The ArtScience museum has the educational aspect attached to it. While you view the exhibits or walk around the place, they make you learn as well. The exhibits are there for a while before they change to a different theme. The theme can be on the current happenings around us that is of interest or just simply a theme of interest."
,,Future world,4.0,,I went to the future world exhibit and really liked it. There aren't a ton of rooms to see but if you take your time it can last an hour or two. I thought the interactive exhibits were really quite ingenuitive.
,,Different exhibition,4.0,,We always love this museum since they keep changing their exhibition. This time is future world and gems. These two exhibits were very cool!! We love to come back for another exhibition in the future.
,,My Visit,4.0,,"It was nice museum when i visit there 2
Exhibits are featured 1 is about precious gems and 1 is about technology. I choose gems exhibit very informative the place was not crowded even there plenty of visitors on that certain exhibit."
,,Very kid friendly museum,5.0,,The museum exhibition was showing wonders of digital possibilites. We can recommend it to everyone. There was slide and other activities for kids.
,,Technology meets art,5.0,,Great place to for kids to explore learn and play.Really liked the Crystal Universe that gives the illusion of stars moving in space.
,,modern museum,5.0,,"a museum that would have multiple exhibits changes in a year, always involved with world class exhibits."
,,Van Cleef Arpels exhibition there,5.0,,"Came here second time all because of the type of exhibition the museum host.
This time is the French Jewellery house - van Cleef Arpels Jewellery exhibition.
There was about 450'items displayed and also the various gems stones in raw form.

If you really love Jewellery and Especially this historical brand. Come and visit.

Get to this museum from Marina Bay Sands retail mall. You will see a pond full of water lilies and a large mirror reflecting the structure.

Look out for all the exhibitions they have on their websites

Book your tickets online to avoid long queues.
Great for family, couples and friends outing during weekends."
,,Future World Exhibition,5.0,,An amazing example of technology meets art. I loved the kids' drawings that were scanned and then included in the virtual real-time full size wall videos. The final station with the light forest that danced to the music was amazing. For kids and adults.
,,Brilliant fun,5.0,,Had a wonderful few hours here at the Future World exhibit. So many fun and interactive elements. Really loved the space zone at the end. So beautiful. Highly recommended.
,,A Friend for Children and Good Family Bonding Activities,3.0,,"I was there last sunday and purchased the FutureWorld Tickets as i was told that there are alot of children activities in the museum.
I was not disappointed as there are indeed many children activities - Slides, Drawing, Hopscotch, interactive games.
The only downside is the museum should have a cafe for parents to sit down and relax while the kids play."
,,Good museum,4.0,,"I went there for the current Future World exhibition. There are around 10-15 exhibits, but I do recommend to take some times to look at each one of them.
The place is quite kids-friendly as most of the exhibits are interactive and allow kids to, for example, add their drawings into the exhibit, play around or reorganize the exhibits. These may not be new but I did see the kids there had a lot of fun."
,,Future World: Be Dazzled!,5.0,,"FUTURE WORLD: WHERE ART MEETS SCIENCE

This new permanent exhibition at the ArtScience Museum located at the Marina Bay Sands area is great for all -- young and old alike. Set in a 1,500 sq m blacked-out area, it offers art installations brought to life in displays of light and participation.

You walk in and there is a interactive garden orchard to greet you -- filled with gorgeous flowers and fluttering butterflies.Don't swot the digital butterflies or they'll drop dead right at your feet!

Next up the a Sea Animation Diorama to educate the masses. Comfortable pillows lull you to sit down, but eventually the sea-sick feeling gets you going to the next installation.

The kids will have a blast of a time in the Town.The urban landscape is challenged as you try to keep the traffic going using wooden blocks set against projected car and trains.

Walk further into the room and you'll find huge and colorful stacking blocks waiting for you to move them around. Light enough for a child of five to push and heave, these Block Chairs change colors as you add and subtract them from each other.

Passing by a seven-meter virtual waterfall, you'll be greeted by a sea of bright beach-balls that changes color and sound. The children will have a ball of a time in an arena filled with mayhem and so-much-smiles (just try taking them out of the pit and you'll find out just how much they love the area!).

Turn yet another corner in the darkened room and you'll find yourself in a ""Star Wars"" universe going at hyper-speed. The Space universe is filled with thousands of LED's that give you an illusion of stars in motion.As the lighting changes, you feel you have moved towards the ""Matrix"" background, then, right before your eyes, the vastness of the cosmos.

Thanks teamLab, the Tokyo-based art collective of ""ultra-technologists"", for bringing this digital playground here!

The people here recommend that tickets be purchased using the museum's online system, also, to check on the admission times. As it's located next to MBS, it's best to take the MRT to the Marina Bay station then walk over.Have fun!"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,It is the best museum ive ever been!! Completely amazing and worth while!! My wife and me loved it so much! We totally recomend the visit!
,,future exhibition so interesting and interactive,5.0,,a very fun 1 hour spent at the exhibition and had lot of fun. the lights and colour and the idea of the lighting and activites really enjoyable
,,Future World rules,5.0,,"If you're in town with kids, do go to this really cool exhibition. Children of all ages will love it. Highly interactive, very modern and some pretty things with light effects for the adults as well."
,,Morning well spent with the Kids,5.0,,My children are very creative and it was very fortunate that they had an interactive art meets science exhibit when we visited. We planned to visit for only a couple of hours but ended up staying past lunchtime as the kids were having so much fun and taking time playing and exploring each interactive display. They enjoyed it so much they asked to go back on another day!
,,Best exhibition so far,5.0,,"Artscience museum tends to have a couple of temporary exhibitions and then a permanent exhibition. The permanent one is really boring and not really worth it so it's all about the temporary exhibitions which they can bring.

Currently they have two - future world and one all about jewelry. Maybe museums are the most popular when aimed at kids. Future world is aimed for kids and it completely blows the mind. Must come! Wish I had exhibitions like this when I was younger and it just paints a picture for me about how even for us adults, when we interact for things is so different now compared to our children's generation."
,,Awesome for kids!,4.0,,"We were lucky to visit on a Friday afternoon when it was kids visit for free, although not an expensive attraction anyway. The technology in here was amazing and lots of fun things for the kids to do. We probably spent just over an hour in there, and while not technically a museum, was an interesting place to visit. Maybe not for adults travelling alone."
,,Maybe better with kids . . .,2.0,,"Went there to fill in some time but there was so little to do or see we were through in 15 minutes.

It is an interesting building. It looked exciting and the exhibit of Future Art sounded interesting. We got there, regrettably, before it opened. We were there at 09h15 and it only opens at 10h00. That was our mistake.

When we did get in we went down to the exhibits and there really are so few. It is based on Nature, Space, etc but, for us, was disappointing. Here we are in Singapore. Centre of tech development and creativity in the East yet the displays were all just projector based. Most of them seemed aimed at children (under 10). There was just so much that could be done with a theme of Future anything. Even the 'compulsory' gift shop only had a few T-shirts and loads of analogue touristy things.

Not great for me. Maybe wonderful with small children."
,,Waste of money,1.0,,"This was the only thing we visited in Singapore that we regretted visiting. I understand the exhibitions vary and we saw ""Future World"". We thought it was better suited to very young children as it consisted of things like coloring in fish and cars to go on a road scene and sea scene. Being a party of three adults we were very disappointed."
,,Not a museum but an exhibition centre,1.0,,"This place does not have any permanent artefacts for viewing, so how can it be called a museum?

Instead, visitors pay to see whatever is currently on temporary display. So, it becomes a matter of whether what is on display, is interesting to a particular visitor.

In our case, the display was called ""Future World"". Mere computer graphics, some colourful toys and many of the sections were intended for children. We found it utterly boring.

We left after a few minutes. It was a waste of time and money."
,,Wish we stayed longer,5.0,,"Such an amazing exhibition. We all loved this place, two adults and children ranging from 21 months, 4 years and 6 years. It was so much fun. Our girls really enjoyed the colouring in of the trucks/airplanes/cars and having them scanned only for them to appear up on the big wall in 3D moving along the ""road"" ... I even coloured a truck in and got such a kick out of seeing it on the big screen.
My favourite was the light exhibition towards the end. I could have sat there all day watching the lights change.
If in Singapore this is a must see place for all the family

Only downside (and this does not take away from the exhibition itself) is the length of time it took to get our tickets. Very slow process and even those that booked online seemed to take ages to get their tickets. They have introduced staggered entry times starting at 10am, then 11.30, then 1pm, 2.30 and so on ... this is a good idea as it gives people a chance to enjoy each section without it getting overly packed"
,,ArtScience Museum,5.0,,Loved it!! Kept the kids busy for hours and hours. Totally interactive and just so much fun!! We attended which the Future City exhibition was on. Don't miss it.
,,Kids loved it,5.0,,"Amazing place to for kids to explore learn and play.

There is one permanent exhibition 'to the future' and they open other exhibitions periodically just make sure to check their website for dates.

Also it's only about 10 minutes from Singapore flyer you can take the bridge to get there."
,,"Disappointing, just a sophisticated kindergarden",1.0,,"Science museums that pride themselves in using cutting edge technology are supposed to be intellectually stimulating and, well, use cutting edge technology. This museum is neither, if your are over 3 years old. The tech used is outdated and the engagement with it is fit only for little kids, which is disappointing since the museum doesn't market itself so."
,,Great structure,3.0,,"The Arts Science Museum at the Marina Bay was something, although we didn't see the show, we were amazed by its structure, one to see."
,,Future World Exhibition,3.0,,Checked out the Future World exhibition at the Art Science museum near MBS today. Quite a few interesting activities for kids inside. It's a fairly small exhibition but surprisingly popular.
,,Enjoy the ArtScience Museum new Exhibition,5.0,,"ArtScience Museum, sculptured like a Lilly.
Currently there is a wonderful interactive exhibition “Where Art Meets Science”, adults can enjoy the exhibits but children will love it. As the museum is not far from the Singapore flyer it makes a good days outing, walking via the Double Helix Bridge. If you follow the estuary along Olympic Walk, towards the tall skyscrapers you will come to the bay opposite Marina Bay Sands Hotel with lots of restaurants along the waters edge opposite Sands Hotel."
,,Awesome Future world exhibition,4.0,,"The new 'Future World' exhibition at Art Science Museum is fascinating.. We were floored by all the sections of the exhibition.. Its beautiful & interactive well targeted at the younger audience.. So much for kids to explore & learn.. MUST VISIT..

Avoid visiting post lunch on weekends..or be ready for long queue.. This permanent exhibition is goin to stay for 3yrs.."
,,Amazing Exhibitions in a fantastic building...,5.0,,Definitely a must see. Beautiful building and amazing exhibitions. Good value for money and if you like their Facebook page before you buy the tickets at the venue you can usually get a 2 for 1 entry deal. Leave plenty of time if you are heading there in the afternoon - we arrived at 5pm and had to wait for an hour to get into the exhibition but it was definitely worth the wait. We saw a hugely interactive series of light show that were an intersection of art and technology - awesome
,,Worth the visit even for an exterior view of the amazing architecture,5.0,,"I visited the Art Science Museum in Spring 2015 for the Leonardo Da Vinci exhibit. I found the exhibit to be absolutely amazing, but as Singapore is the most expensive city in the world, the entry fee wasn't small at $25.

I'm not sure I would have normally chosen to visit the museum if it hadn't been an exhibit that really interested me. Even if you don't want to enter, definitely go check out the exterior architecture. The building is a modern, metal lotus flower and is just stunning! Well worth a visit for the architecture. It's just a short walk from the huge mall and is easy to get to via the metro system."
,,"Fantastic museum, with playful and thought-provoking exhibits",5.0,,"Spent hours here during my first afternoon in Singapore. The upper floors had very thought-provoking modern art exhibits. I'm someone who loves thinking deeply, being provoked by good art, and I happily spent most of my time on the ""adult"" floors. Kudos for the whole concept of this museum--art and science are two languages for exploring same subjects and this museum blends them both really well.

The Future World exhibit on lower floor was also entertaining and no doubt shows the future of art: playful, interactive, colorful. I can hear kids 50 years from now, ""You mean your art just sat there and did nothing??"" This art moves and changes when you touch it. In fact, you're part of the process of creating it! I loved watching kids and adults create and engage with the art--just as much fun as the art itself.

There was more to see of Singapore but I was happy I gave my best energy to this museum!"
,,Need to be more selective,3.0,,"I been on a Sunday noon time, I love the Exibition, verry interesting interaction set up and verry ludique.
I not put high rate because one verry annoying thing is all peoples comme not for the Exibition but for only selfies and report to there friend. All phone on and flash on room suppose to be dark are annoying for me and all that person going to pose on front of he screen all the time.
A nice plus will be to not allow any camera inside for force people to enjoy the moment more than just be here for show to the Froend !"
,,"Future World, an excellent permanent exhibition",5.0,,The Future World exhibition is the new permanent exhibition at the ArtScience Museum and it is truly a fun and interactive exhibition with lots of great installations for the young and young at hear and all the instagrammers out there. It is really engaging for the kids and family. Yes it is a bit small but overall still very good
,,Awesome Exhibtion,4.0,,"Went to the FutureWorld exhibition and I must say, I was wowed. The interactive elements, play of projection is world class. This is a fun ground for kids and adults alike. Enjoy coloring on paper your own fish and watch it come alive in the great big ocean projected on the walls. This is a great place to spend a few hours with children in tow."
,,Disappointed,2.0,,"The queues were so long because the tickets are not issued fast. There is no set path to follow, we asked to go to the basement, which is all for kids. When we came out, we were lost. We thought that was it. When we asked the security guard as to what's happening upstairs, we were asked to take the lift up. On the 5th floor, there was some abstract video being shown. No guide to describe what was going on. Most staff don't speak English.
Waste of money."
,,Wonderful Collider Exhibit,4.0,,"Beautiful building on the outside, super smart on the inside! Was able to catch the Collider exhibit. Fantastic and very interesting, especially for science nerds. Not just for kids. Adults will find it very fascinating. If you have time, the film on the collider will help people understand the science of that massive experiment even more."
,,Ever-changing exhibits!,5.0,,"This museum may seem small but it contains some of the most interesting exhibits that you will can see. When I visited, it was to see the Collider and Hermes Leather Forever exhibits, which provided a really immersive experience. The exhibits will change every few months, which makes it even better."
,,Visa run to Singapore resulted in visit to the Science Museum - amazing!,5.0,,We are homeschooling our daughter in Bali. Our visa run took us to Singapore on the last day of the Collide Science Physics event. It was amazing. So much learnt in one day. Great experience for us both mother and daughter learning:)
,,Interesting Exhibits,4.0,,This is a small museum but worth your time. We specifically went to see the Large Hadron Collider exhibit and it was very well done. I know the exhibits rotate so check this museum out to see what they have when you are there.
,,Outstanding !!!,5.0,,"It was a unique experience visiting the ArtScience Museum at Singapore. The Museum's mission is to show how the Arts inspires Science and vice-versa. Temporary special exhibits are splendid in its organization, content and display. The special exhibit when we visited in the last week of Jan was the ""Large Hadron Collider"" which is exceptional in its conceptual design and portrayal. It shows how the atomic particles are charged up and collided at almost the speed of light in a bid to re-create the instant after Big Bang. Pictures/videos of how the God particle was detected are superb. Interesting immersive audio-visual on an artist's conception of the emergence of order from chaos after the Big Bang. It is a must see. The architecture of the building is unusually beautiful - it is shaped like a Lotus with Lily ponds around. The view of the surroundings is breath taking!"
,,Good if the current exibition interests you.,3.0,,I went to the collider exhibition. I thought it was well set out and had a range of ways of presenting it which was good. I enjoyed it but wouldn't rave about it. If your into that sort of thing though then you would probably enjoy it more.
,,"The museum does not have its own collections, but LHC was cool",3.0,,"This museum does not really have collections, they only have seasonal exhibitions.

I went there to see the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a huge particle collider which was originally located in France-Switzerland. As someone who enjoys studying science I found this exhibition to be quite cool, and the videos were also cool. Being able to see actual parts of LHC meant a lot to me. If you're into Physics and Chemistry would definitely recommend visiting this exhibition.

Plus I got free bottled vitamin water after the visit (which tasted a bit weird imo)"
,,More beautiful outside then inside,3.0,,"Was a little disappointed at how small the museum was on the inside. Very clean and friendly staff but not impressed with our visit, becausexwecwere expecting more."
,,Good rainy day venue if science your thing,3.0,,"A museum that seems to comprise mostly a series of special exhibitions rather than scientific exhibits as I expected. However the displays on Nobel were very informative and made great use of interactive video to allow you to explore aspects of his life and legacy.The Hadron Collider showed in detail what has been built there and why, and again made good use of imaginative videos, mock-ups and actual parts to allow you to believe you have actually been there and met some of the staff. One bonus is excellent free-access wifi!"
,,Very interesting exhibitions currently ongoing!,4.0,,"Spent a short afternoon here to cover the Nobel Prize and the Collider exhibitions both of which really appealed to my geeky self. Impressive state-of-the-art showcases that are highly educational! As a layman who has always been interested in physics, I finally understood what the higgs boson was all about despite having read about it some time ago.

The other interesting part of this place was the part on Ideas for the Future where the public can pen down their thoughts and ideas on post-its and it's really heartwarming to see some of what others have written.

Catch them while they are still here."
,,High quality exhibition,5.0,,"I think the ArtScience Museum has a permanent exhibition about Singapore, but we visited to view a temporary exhibition about deep sea creatures. If all their exhibitions are of this quality, I would highly recommend going if they have something on that catches your eye."
,,Interesting and educational,5.0,,Worth a look if you have an hour or two. At the moment there's a free exhibition about the Nobel Prize. How it was set up and the contributions that have helped to shape science and society.
,,Worth a trip,4.0,,"Visited the DreamWorks exhibition and the deep sea creatures exhibition - both presented how art and science blend together in a playful way. Was really impressed with the deep sea exhibition, a lot of content. DreamWorks exhibition was fun, although not a large exhibition. Still both good for a range of ages"
,,Educational,5.0,,This was something I came upon wondering around after Gardens by the Bay. They had an exhibit of the LHC. Worth it for us nerds out there.
,,Great exhibitions,5.0,,We visited both the Hedron Super Collider exhibit as well as the Nobel Prize exhibition. The Nobel Prize exhibition was free entry. Both exhibitions were interesting and educational. The exhibits gave a good insight into physics and the work people have done over time to improve life for many.
,,very good,4.0,,very good useful for enriching our feed back lovely amusing one i did not see ant activity in this visit as i heard some time they have but i enjoy my visit
,,"Fabulous museum, and it's free!",5.0,,A wonderful museum in a lovely location. Interesting building architecturally. There was a fabulous Hermes exhibition on when we were there that was worthy of the V&A -- and even that was free!
,,Awesome and Amazing Museum.,5.0,,"There are two parts of the museum i.e. free admission and chargeable admission.

For exhibition with free admission, it is awesome. The organizer really put in a lot of effort to prepare the exhibition though they didn’t charge single cent. Currently, the exhibition is The Nobel Prize: Ideas Changing. the World.

For exhibition with chargeable admission, it is just amazing. Currently, the exhibition is The Collider.

If you are travelling with young children, you may want to visit it on the Friday since it is so-called family day. It is free for children (upto 4) with every adult."
,,The Lotus Shaped Museum 🇸🇬,4.0,,"This museum stands out compared to the others I've been to! This lotus shape building is definitely an attention seeker so I went here while visiting the Marina Bay Sands!

I visited on November 2015, which they hosted two exhibits: ""Hermes: Leather Forever"" & ""The Nobel Prize: Ideas Changing The World"". Tickets were complimentary.

The Hermes exhibit was very eye catching but it was a very quick one for me since I'm not really into it. Nonetheless it was somewhat interesting to see all the leather and colors incorporated for this product!

On the other hand, I really liked the Nobel Prize exhibit! There were lots of inspiring information from beginning to end! It also highlights very influential individuals from around the world! From what I heard they worked really hard on bringing this exhibit to Singapore, so it was nice to see it myself! Some of the displays were interactive as well which I liked!

Must visit if you have time to spare!"
,,Beautiful lotus shaped museum with interesting exhibits!,4.0,,"The Art Science museum near Marina Bay Sands Shoppes is a unique one having exhibits which change over a period of time. At the time when we visited it, there was a wonderful French brand Hermes exhibit on leather and how products are cut and made out of it. It was quite an informative exhibits with lovely and creative displays as well as interactive exhibits. Was quite fun to watch and participate.That particular day their permanent exhibit area was closed for a private function so couldnt visit that section. Theres a shop on the basement level where we got free juice bottles. Even the entrance to the leather exhibition was free but theres a charge for permanent exhibits and special exhibits. Outside the entrance to the museum is a delightful lily pond and great views of the Marina Bay Sand , the Flyer and the Helix bridge too starts from there. Even the light and sound show at night is nearby. It is quite worth it to spend at least half a day in the entire area visiting the skypark, the shoppes, museum, helix bridge and experience the visually entertaining light and sound show."
,,Travellers who are explorer,5.0,,"Another great museum to visit as this is really a world class museum compare to others. The new architecture welcomes u with a ""handy smile"". Location of the museum is a walking distance from the shoppe and MBS hotel. A must go museum for everyone, anyone from any country !"
,,Lotus shape building with lots of surprises,5.0,,"Located at the Marina Bay, this is a very modern looking building, shaped of a Lotus. There is a very nice lily ponds before you get to the entrance. It can host multiple exhibits. Most recently, I got to view the Nobel Prize exhibition, learnt a lot of worthy winners and how new inventions had evolved through times.
Do check this museum and the most current exhibitions when you are in Singapore."
,,Stunning building with fantastic diplays.,3.0,,"We had walked across the Helix bridge and were walking around the Marina Bay shopping centre across the road from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel trying to get some good photos of the Hotel and the Oberon Lion Fountain as saw a sign about the latest show. Now parts of the building have free access and stunning views while the special show required payment to enter.
What is interesting is the role that this building plays in the light and sound show at night as this is the ""CUP"" and plays a role. See review of light show for further info and places to watch from.

The Art building contains a number of hands on exhibitions several are stunning as well as Art from local artists. The way the building winds around and operates on the different wings and levels is brilliant. You can walk around and challenge yourself to get to all the nooks and exhibition areas.

As with so much of Singapore it is a stones throw from the City centre, Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Hotel and more. The hop on hop off bus stops nearby but take the time to walk the Helix Bridge which is located next to this centre. Staff are friendly and able to address many languages and questions.

The thing is that you can take your time and spend several hours or visit a couple of times and take it all in."
,,First Visit to the ArtScience Museum (the LHC exhibit),3.0,,"Was there for the Large Hadron Collider Exhibition which was ran concurrently with Nobel Prize exhibition. The ticketed LHC exhibition was OK.. was expecting a bit more. There was slightly more emphasis on the recent achievements of the LHC is discovering the Higgs Boson particle. It's a very very technical and scientific exhibit. Rather fitting to the theme and name of the museum but as it dealt with rather advance physics, it might not be very engaging to visitors who might not have prior knowledge on the science behind it.. It does help if there were some guided tour..."
,,Special place.,4.0,,"I've been here two times now. Last time was for Singapore Stories. That was a great exhibition. The first time I was a bit disappointed on the exhibition itself as Singapore seems to have this way of talking up an exhibition that eventually isn't really that big or great. But still, even when I liked less the exhibition itself, the actual place where it is exhibited is great. I mean, the shape of the museum itself and the feeling when you're walking inside it, it's just a must-see for anyone visiting Singapore. It really is. They also have a nice gift shop in case you want to take home a souverir, like I did twice."
,,Always something amazing going on,5.0,,"The ArtScience museum has been open for sometime now, but only recently did I realize how great it is. First of all are the exhibition prices: all exhibitions currently running at time of writing are priced very reasonably, and being a local gives an even more reasonable price. What is more , there are plenty of exhibitions that have tickets for the low,low price of free!
Currently, there is an exhibition on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. I highly recommend it, as (how I said before) it is very reasonably priced and (more importantly) probably the best thing you will see. Seriously, the apparatus used to discover the electron is displayed! What more could you ask for? But, with that being said, do yourself a favour and skip the first movie they show, as it is terrible.
All in all, the ArtScience Museum is great, what with all the cheap tickets and the innovative shape of the building, For locals and tourists alike, this place is a must visit."
,,Very educational,4.0,,"I always love the exhibits at the Art Science museum. This time, the museum plays host to the Collider exhibition, which describes the incredible particle physics experiments conducted at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Geneva.

You don't have to be a science buff to visit - the explanations were really good even for the science challenged."
,,Lotus flower building,4.0,,"This is an unusually shaped building which was original. I came here with my 8 year old niece and saw the the Collider, Nobel Prize: Ideas Changing the World and Hermes Leather Forever exhibitions. It was a good location and was a good venue to take children although the Collider was perhaps a bit advanced for her (& for me!)"
,,The building itself is more impressive than what's inside,2.0,,"My wife and I didn't find the exhibitions interesting but I guess it comes down to personal taste.

The building itself looks cool. If you're on a tight schedule consider skipping this."
,,Exhibits are good,4.0,,"The place seems a bit lack luster but if you are lucky you can get good exhibit to view. When we visited, we saw a good one on Deep Sea Explorations. It was very intensive and was presented in an awesome manner. Really informative for us as well as our kid."
,,Good place for exploration!,4.0,,Great place to discover new things. Art and science exhibits are very interesting! Amazing facade – must take a picture of the exterior of the building!
,,Stylish - uh - water lotus shaped building,4.0,,"Rather a soulless place - seems to lack the heart of the national museums. There were 4 exhibitions when we visited - three eco-themed exhibitions: “The Deep”, “Living Yangtze” and “Healing Spaces” – plus a freebie, “Hermes; Leather Forever” which was nothing to do with the environment – but rather wonderful anyway … high security presence… there don't seem to be any permanent exhibitions so your motive for visiting will be the current attraction. Fabulous location so plenty to see anyway when you're finished here...."
,,ArtScience Museum,4.0,,"October 2015 . The Building is great , the Design very good ! The Exhibition is interesting , the Staff very friendly ."
,,great museum and great location,4.0,,go the the MBS and then visit this museum just opposite to the MBS. nice architecture with stunning exhibits
,,Admission Expensive and too small a museum,3.0,,exhibits too few and place too small and not that interesting unless there is a specific exhibit specifically brought by the museum. better to spend time admiring LV special boutique and the many shops in the MBS Shoppes. not for real museum lovers thought the lotus flower designed museum is impressive externally.
,,last day in singapore activity,5.0,,we wanted something cool and low energy and this was such a lovely way to spend a morning. i guess it depends on the exhibitions that they have on at the time but we were super impressed by the deep sea creature one and the gorgeous sensory and photographic ones that were on when we were there. no cafe but marina bay mega shopping area is a five minute walk away.
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,"We attended with 2 adults and 2 kids (aged 4 & 10). We got in trouble for being too noisy in one of the exhibitions of the underwater world. Overall it was a great place. With our ticket we got a free full sugar warm can of drink - lol - ya. I actually had goosbumps in there it was so cold - especially after being in the humidity outside and feeling damp most of the time. There was an exhibition on about cartoons and how they originated. We loved it as adults and the kids, at their ages, were not interested in reading and just rushed through everything."
,,Excellent day at the museum,5.0,,"Really enjoyed the DreamWorks experience, really goo dto see the animation and get involved in some drawing and making Kung Fu Panda expressions change. Tales of Singapore was interesting free attraction. The Deep will educational was a bit dry but had some unique exhibits"
,,Sustainable Exhibition,2.0,,There were 3 exhibitions available for $17 fee with a suggestion you could spend around 45 minutes in each. I just went to the 1 section for $5. It was about some guy's trip down the Yangtze River looking for his artistic inspiration and filled with ads for a crystal company that runs sustainable water classes to help these inhabitants. Tiresome to see the credits roll on each mini film and listen to monotone voices and repetitive music. A few nice photos but overall not especially interesting. It could have been considering the subject matter. A beautiful building but wasting space. There are much better museums.
,,Top class exhibition about the Deep,5.0,,"We spent a fascinating 2 hours learning about the creatures that live under the sea, specialising in those that are deeper than 600m up to several km. Little was known about them until the past 49 years. Here you can see some fish in bottles, observe bioilluminensce in jars aided by a UV torch and read about and see numerous creatures at varying deigns, the ravages of deep drag net fishing destroying their habitat is explained and it clearly a worrying uncontrolled practice that's needs to be curbed. There is an activity area for children but the exhibition would suit older children only.
The location is great at the new Marina Bay Area with shops and food courts nearby. It is also a pleasant walk to the Cloud Dome which should not be missed!"
,,Interesting,3.0,,We attended the Deep marine exhibition which was interesting and the Singapore Stories. The building is really interesting although it is actually quite cold and spartan inside.
,,Educational wonderland!!,5.0,,"If you ever get to Singapore, you cannot possibly miss this wonder of the world!! We visit Singapore and have found many unbelievably educational and interesting exhibits here. This time it is The Deep, which is a beautiful, almost surreal study of the deep ocean, deeper than 300 meters (1000 feet). The information is mind boggling but the models and descriptions are just mind-boggling. We had adults and children 3 and 7 with us and all were mesmerized. This museum hosts one after another beautiful and or mind boggling exhibitions. This is about as far as you can get from the US of A but worth the trip for so many reasons. In addition, Marina Bay S house many other events and venues worth visiting and world class restaurants and shopping. Do not miss."
,,Interesting museum,4.0,,"Visited there in September.
Saw the DreamWorks + Deep Sea exhibitions + the one about Singapore.
Everything is organized very well.
Enjoyed most of the exhibitions."
,,Little showcase,4.0,,"At the time, the museum was showcasing DreamWorks production. Since young age, I was a big fan of Disney animation movies. And my visit to the museum helped me to understand more on the actual works that goes towards the making of animated movies. The museum also houses other interesting subjects. However, my focus was only on DreamWorks."
,,Visit this museum when you're in Singapore!,5.0,,You should visit ArtScience Museum when you're in Singapore for holiday. The Museum is just about half a minute walk from Marina Bay Sands. ArtScience museum is adorably designed and there are exciting exhibitions that will blow your mind. Luckily I had a chance to join the Dream Works Animation Exhibition and The Deep Exhibition. There are all impressive with many interacted activities.
,,Eclectic Exhibitions,4.0,,"We've seen and enjoyed exhibits on a variety of subjects from Andy Warhol, the Titanic, the Egyptians, and most recently, the Deep (and Dreamworks*). All have been well organized and good value for money.

Hot tips: 1) Singapore citizens, Permanent Residents, employment pass and work permit holders pay less for admission tickets. 2) *All show passes offer further discounts and ours included a free drink from the souvenir shop in the basement, hence I saw Dreamworks even though I normally would have given it a miss. 3)"
,,DreamWorks exhibition is cute,4.0,,"I went for the Deep and DreamWorks exhibition today. Its a bit noisy initially cos schools are conducting excursions for students. The deep is an informative, well displayed, informative exhibition from surface of sea to the abyss, showcasing marine lives and their unique survival transformative powers of adaption to deep sea living environment. The DreamWorks exhibition is small but cute. It features how animations came to life from sketches to the big screen. among the movies presented are shrek, how to train your Dragon, kungfu panda and Madagascar. The air is super cold for the Deep exhibition so it's good to bring a jacket."
,,Dreamworks was quite impressive but small and Pricey ....,2.0,,"I just visited the dream work. It was nice to see how the animation work and all.... the Little short movie is great. At the same time i found it a bit too small.
I took my 3 years old and i dont think it excited him that much....and had to pay for his ticket since over 2 have to pay..... So i found it too little for the money....
I think Dream work is more dedicated for people that actually are into the drawing, it is totally amazing how the whole thing works."
,,"Dreamworks exhibit was cool, but small and pricey.",3.0,,"If it wasn't for the Dreamworks exhibit I wouldn't have bothered paying for entrance, which is quite pricey for a relatively small museum. The museum's exterior is one of it's highlights though and you can witness that for free! ;)"
,,"Beautiful building, interesting exhibits,but kind of small.",3.0,,"I battled my way walking to the Marina Bay from my hotel during a freak thunderstorm and heavy down pour determined to visit this museum, you can also access by metro and I think the buses stop here aswell. And kinda struggled to fill my time if I'm honest. I paid $30 SG for entry into The Deep and Dreamworks exhibits; personally by UK standards I don't think that's very expensive, but can see how it would be if you're travelling with a family.

I loved The Deep and spent over an hour wandering through the exhibit, I found the Dreamworks exhibit over quite quickly and the rest of the museum much smaller in comparison and nothing else here seemed to grab my attention. Maybe I had just over estimated how much time I could realistically potter about in here for. I think the Dreamworks exhibit was more enjoyed by the children I saw there and the layout didn't really appeal to me, having to drag out the 40mins I spent looking around and messing with interactive drawing computers. I much preferred The Deep exhibit and loved dawdling around in the dark looking at all the scary dead fish (but that probably says more about me as a person). I probably should have just paid the cheaper entry fee for this exhibit but I had time to kill and might not have gotten my voucher for a free drink if I had done that.

The Singapore stories exhibit added some local cultural and historical knowledge but by this time I was a losing attention span, and the 4th floor holds information on design inspiration for the architecture of the building which is pretty cool,but these are much smaller feeling areas. Overall all the different parts of the museum had their own unique appeal and interactive learning activities, but I struggled to fill a few hours here nevermind an afternoon, or try and make this an all day event. But it did eventually stop raining!"
,,Expensive for what you get ...,3.0,,"Singapore has so many fantastic museums that I guess I had high expectations, and I was disappointed. I saw Dreamworks, the Deep and Singapore Stories. They were all interesting enough, but there just wasn't very much there. On the other hand, I had seen similar exhibits before at other places. For tourists, I'd recommend the Asian Civilisations Museum, or Gardens by the Bay for a better value for your money."
,,Costly but interesting,3.0,,"The ticket buying process was very tedious with a long queue due to a system breakdown and insufficient number of staff while I was visiting. The entry tickets are quite costly and I recommend to get a Marina Bay Sands membership card to receive a discount.
The DreamWorks exhibition was absolutely wonderful with very interesting exhibits and facts."
,,Elegant Structure ArtScience Museum in Singapore,4.0,,Beautiful and elegantly-designed building which resembled an open lotus flower. It boasts their state-of-art architecture. Displays objects and artefacts that attest to the artistic and scientific accomplishments on humankind through the ages.
,,very neat and clean and vast space,5.0,,last year I had visited this awesome museum.the shape itself is so unique and we saw an exhibition out here.the lotus like structure is a landmark on the singapore skyline itself.
,,Serene and relaxing!,4.0,,"Structurally beautiful and easy to navigate and with affordable ticket prices. Also has some free exhibits, just ask the many museum staff who are willing to help.
You can spend 1-3 hours there depending on your pace and interest. And the location is brilliant as you can shop in the mall or grab a bite nearby. Then you can walk across the Helix bridge and head to Merloin Park!"
,,Fun and yet educational trip,5.0,,"When my family visited the museum last weekend, we had the chance to visit the Dreamworks (think Madagascar and Kungfu Panda) and the Deep exhibition. Both were awesome.

My children had fun creating the animation and playing at the game booths.

It was also an eye opener for my whole family to learn so much about the mysterious deep ocean."
,,Expensive,3.0,,Went into the Deep exibition and it was very pricey I thought but enjoyed all the information and pictures. The top part of the museum wasn't worth the look but it was the end of the day and was my 5th museum so could have been just me
,,One place for unique exhibition,5.0,,"Straits Times celebrated 170 yrs of its existence in Singapore and what an exhibition it was. History came alive in the few hours that I spent there. Very well organised display of newspapers and articles from different time periods.
Arts Science museum comes up with unique exhibitions that give us a glimpse of the social and cultural world around us. Truly worth a visit."
,,Interestinng,4.0,,We went along to the dreamworks exhibit which was really cool. It was so nice to go in and relax in the air conditioning on a hot Singapore day!
,,Extremely Magnificent! Educational Exhibitions!,5.0,,"There were 3 exhibitions during my visit to the ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands (MBS). They were Dreamworks Animation, The Deep, and Singapore Stories.
Basically, Dreamworks Animations consists of exhibitions of how animations such as the famous Madagascar and Shrek were created from scratch and how ideas were generated. The Deep exhibits creatures in regards to fauna which are situated deep within the ocean. This sea creatures are so deep that even us as humans, maybe are incapable of getting down there because of the enormous pressure. This is exciting because we don't normally see any of them. Moving on would be Singapore stories, which is held for the celebrations of SG50. I got to see the history of Singapore and how it developed itself to where it is today.
All in all, it was a great experience. They provided a beautiful learning platform for individual experiences. Yes, the learning platform is measured for individual experience, which satisfied me in a good manner. Interactive hands-on activities are also provided for example, for the Dreamworks Animation exhibition, there was a sketching lab whereby visitors are allowed to sketch into a touchscreen monitor and to generation moving animations. Young children activities were also provided as well.
All in all, ArtScience museum is a must go for visitors who wish to learn something new. My individual experience was a fantastic one. Besides, everyday is a learning day isn't it?
The architectural design of the building itself is stunning. With lilies surrounding its perimeter, it gives the vibe of a cool place and I mean it literally! So, for those who are afraid of the cold temperatures, please remember to bring a jacket!!!"
,,Coolest building!,5.0,,This building is extremely beautiful and interesting from the outside and houses some even cooler exhibits inside! We saw the Deep and Dreamworks exhibits which were both very well curated and astonishing in their inclusiveness.
,,Timing is everything,3.0,,"Having discovered this place through my research, I had pretty much decided that this was one of the places that I was going to visit while in Singapore. The thing is that with many of these museums you need to time yourself properly otherwise you won't find any exhibitions here of any interest. This was the case when I visited, namely because I wanted something uniquely Singaporean as opposed to something that might (or might not) land up in a museum in Australia (or elsewhere). However they did have one interesting exhibit, and that was the history of Singapore as told by its major newspaper, the Straights Time. It was quite an interesting half-an-hour, however the other two exhibitions really held no interest for me."
,,Educational visit,5.0,,"Visited the art science museum during our national holiday, queue was long but manageable. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The exhibitions was Dreamworks, Deep Sea and Singapore Then and Now, it was an informative experience which we enjoyed and will be back again when there are other exhibits that cater to our interests."
,,Nice exhibitions,4.0,,"I visited twice. Once the Da Vinci exposition and now The Deep and the (free) SG50 exposition. They were all very nicely presented and interesting. If you have any kind of Singaporean ID (S-Pass, EP, etc.) don't forget to bring it with you, there is a discount. One annoying thing: the aircon is very powerful, take an extra layer of clothes."
,,"Interesting, informative.",4.0,,"Went on the SG50 weekend so entry was free for Singaporeans, but had to queue almost 2 hours to get in. I'm sure normally there wouldn't be a queue.

The exhibitions that were on display when we were there were the DreamWorks exhibition, which showcased DreamWorks' masterpieces from drawing board to the big screen, and The Deep, which showcased the deep-sea creatures and information on the deep-sea expeditions.

Though it was super crowded that day, we learned a lot from the exhibitions.

Will consider going to other exhibitions as they come."
,,ArtScience Museum ... It really depends on what highlight touring exhibitions are on show when you visit,3.0,,"Opened in February 2011, in a uniquely lotus shaped building with ten skyward extension, it either look like a pair of cupped hands or a blossoming lotus flower.
The ArtScience Museum is part of the entire Marina Bay Sands complex in Singapore and the building itself have become as iconic as the '3 legged' MBS hotel behind.
Privately owned and operated by MBS, the museum celebrates creativity at Its best through art, science, design, media, architecture and technology.
With 1 permanent exhibition on the above, the other 3 galleries are for touring exhibition.
At my time of visit, it was Singapore Then and Now, Dreamworks Animation and The Deep.
Singapore Then and Now is set up by Singapore Press Holdings, the folks who have been printing our newspapers since then 1845. This exhibition is a highlights of key events in Singapore's history through an array of news headlines and news clippings. It is part of the Singapore Golden Jubilee Celebration.
The most enjoyable visit for me is to Dreamworks Animation exhibition. It is great to see up close the design process, props, storyboards, art works of some of our favorite characters up close.
The Deep is the other exhibition that I enjoyed. Lost of deep sea creatures and specimens on display.
Overall, in my humble opinion, a visit to this museum really depends on what exhibition is showing and if it really peak your interest, otherwise, it will be a hefty price to pay just to visit this place."
,,Free admission for National Day celebration,4.0,,"After nearly queueing for 45 minutes, we were admitted into this iconic lotus-shaped building. The main exhibitions were ""Singapore STories: Then, Now, Tomorrow"", ""Dreamworks Animation - the Exhibition"" and the Deep. I found them to be mildly of interest but would not have paid the normally chargeable S$22.00 pax. Maybe if they have more exciting exhibitions in future ..."
,,A lot of history for free,4.0,,"I entered by curiosity and a employee of the museum handled me a free ticket for the exposition about the ""Strait Times"" . I took this chance and rode the elevator to the 3rd floor. The exposition was about all the aspects of the life in Singapore since the newspaper was created. I found it very interesting and complete. You could read the first pages of the newspaper related to the theme of the zone like politics, sports, education... I have found it very interesting and informative."
,,Educational entertainment,5.0,,"I went with a couple of my friends and it was very nice and educational, the atmosphere was nice and everyone was helpful and they appeared to be more interested in delivering a message than to just do their work."
,,One of a kind,5.0,,"We visited the Deep exhibition. Simple but well organised exhibition, lots and lots of educational point. Joint the family day tour and saw kids really learned a lot although my own fell asleep half way. Probably my daughter who is just 3 is way too young to follow, but i can say the set up, dark and quiet exhibition site keep her soundly asleep and we adults really had a good time for the exhibition"
,,Lots to look at in the Lotus,5.0,,"Great blend of free and pay to visit exhibitions in this gorgeous lotus flower shaped building. We saw the DreamWorks exhibition, which the children loved and was highly interactive and a very interesting static display documenting Singapore's past 50 years."
,,Vaguely interesting exhibits to pass an afternoon,3.0,,"When I went there was an exhibition about Dreamworks animated movies and one about Deep Sea.

The Dreamworks one was disappointing as I was hoping for information about the animation technology but it was mostly just pictures of the different characters. Probably best for small children who know the movies well.

The Deep Sea one was more interesting. If it was less crowded and there were fewer people with stupid selfie sticks taking pictures of themselves for 20mins in front of each exhibit the experience may have been more enjoyable. It amazes me at the beautiful and interesting places people go to and all they want to do is take pictures of themselves. Anyway, the exhibit did have lots of interesting information and is worth an hour of your time."
,,The Deep & Dreamworks Exhibition,5.0,,"We were staying in Marina Bay Sands Hotel and admission here was part of our perks. Being free in my opinion makes it more enjoyable for us. We went here July 14 and there were only two exhibitions that were available and we were told that the other areas of the museum were closed due to private events. They were featuring only the DreamWorks and The Deep. I found the Deep Exhibition (illuminating the mysteries of the deep sea) more interesting most likely because I have a fascination for deep sea creatures. I like their skeletal displays as well as the photo displays. The area wasn't that big but enough for the people to move around. There's also a video area where you can rest while watching. Another exhibit was the DreamWorks Animation which features the journey of creating from sketch to screen our loved characters of the animation. In the exhibition you will see characters made of clays from the movie Kung Fu Panda. It was fun doing the interactive station of the Madagascar Characters. There are plenty of artworks, drawings, models and interactive displays of favorite animated classic characters such as Shark Tale, Chicken Run, Wallace & Gromit, etcs. Of course the well loved characters of Madagascar tops them all. Kids will definitely love the DreamWorks exhibition and The Deep is more geared for the adults coz there are plenty of reading the labels."
,,Dreamworks Exhibition,5.0,,"Currently they have a lovely fun exhibition by Dreamworks that is worth visiting. I also in general recommend this museum as it's accessible, always have updated collections or exhibits, great for families and friends to hang out, and right by the Marina - which makes it a stunning view."
,,Outstanding exhibits,5.0,,Loved the exhibits that were there at the time we visited which were Dreamworks and The Deep. Would recommend this to anyone
,,stress reliever!,4.0,,"The Deep Sea exhibition is an extremely comforting exhibit. Bathed in low UV lights and sounds of the deep sea, walking through this exhibit is a haunting but fascinating experience. 

I spent a little over an hour slowly reading all the explainations. It's not the most kid friendly place since the exhibit offers more words than luminated preserved creatures, but I think older children would still find it interesting. My one comment would be that the exhibits are confusingly labeled. There would be explanations for creatures that weren't even displayed, and there was no proper numbering to show which description corresponded to the display.

There's also a video area with bean bags that would honestly make a brilliant nap spot, but I'm not saying you should do that... maybe."
,,Very interesting and informative,5.0,,"We went to the wonders of the deep sea exhibit. It was fantastic. There was so much to read and look at. We all learnt something. We were there for about 2 hours, but could have spent more time here, but the kids got hungry."
,,Not the real thing,2.0,,Paid a high price for da Vinci exhibition. most of the exhibits were replicas. You can see the real thing in Italy and other Euoprean cities for far cheaper or free. bit of a waste of time
,,The Deep was awesome,5.0,,"Saw The Deep -exhibit. You get to know the deep sea creatures in complete darkness, very cool!

The actual preserved fish and other creatures were the best part. They use soundscapes by NASA, very creative. It created a surreal vibe. There's also a film that showcases deep sea creatures swimming, you can relax in a bean-bag chair and see it."
,,Interactive exhibits,5.0,,"This is indeed a very unique building and an architectural find. The main exhibitions are on the basement floor so there is enough space to contain everything 

Usually at any given time, there will be two temporary exhibitions. I have been to several. They are a good range from history like mumies, and Cheng Ho to contemproary figures like Andy Warhoal and children-themed exhibitions like dinosaurs, to the current dreamworks animationns. It tends to be good enterainment for 1 - 2 hours. I am not sure if I learn a lot but there are a lot of things to see, documentaries with people talking / explaining and interactive computer games. For dreamworks, the 180 movie through the eyes of a dunisaur was breath-taking. I certainly have a new appreciation of the animation artist even though there were exhibits that were simply cutting up scenes from movies I have seen before. Its 2 hours of good fun even though I think its a bit expensive espespecially since kids above 2 have to pay. 

The exhibitions tend to be more suited for adults but they get around the problem by having artwork and handicraft to do throughout the exhibition. Some of the interactive games are also more suited for  young children. so I woudl recommend the museum for people with young kids as well. 

Currently in-line with SG50, they also have a free exhibition on Singapore - that means you dont even have to pay to go in. I think this is brilliant and i hope they make it into a permanent exhibition. The exhibition gives the history of singapore via headlines and photos. As usual TVs all around with documentaries about Singapore. I think this is good for tourists. Otherwise the normal permanent exhibitions in Artscience museum are not very good.

The exhibition halls are very cold - make sure you bring a jacket. "
,,Exceeded expectations,4.0,,"Went to see the Dreamworks Animation exhibition with my daughter and was pleasantly surprised to find out that kids under 12 get in for free on Fridays.

Artscience Museum staff, though young, were polite and enthusiastic. The toilets were kept immaculately clean. And you can't help but linger over the beautiful pink and violet water lilies in the pond outside the museum. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience."
,,Lots Of Family Fun!,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to see the Deamworks Animation and Deep Exhibitions here. My two Kindergarten age kids loved the exhibitions.

The facility itself if beautifully designed and built, intriguing in itself.

I must admit, we had a little trouble finding the entrance as we were expecting it to be near the water feature as that's where a large congregation of people were.

We went on a Friday, and the kids were Free, which was a bonus! Also included was a complimentary bottle of coke."
,,"Great disparity between ""permanent"" and ""temporary"" exhibits",3.0,,"We visited here in July 2015. I had expected very little from this iconic ""hand-shaped"" or ""lotus flower shaped"" museum, but ""Wow!"" I was pleasantly surprised. Exiting the Marina Bay Shoppes and walking outdoors to enter the museum, I noticed the clever design of the museum, which gave the perception of openness while the tall, overhanging ""bowl shape"" of the Museum actually protected you from rain (it was raining heavily when we went). The lotus pond with bright purple blooms leading up to the entrance can't be missed either. Perhaps the only pitfall of the museum's design was the upper floors that make up the ""flower"" has very little functional space for exhibits. The larger temporary exhibits, definitely the main draw of the museum, is actually underground and not really part of the museum's iconic ""shape"".

As with many Singapore attractions, residents & citizens get a discount on tickets. Definitely get the ""full"" ticket which allows you to tour the temporary exhibitions (when we visited, a deep sea and Dreamworks animation exhibit) as well as the dismal ""ArtScience Galeries"" upstairs (more on that later).

I was definitely amazed at ""The Deep"" exhibit (one of the temporary exhibits), which showcased a variety of deep sea specimens and their unique environmental adaptions to the hostile life in the ocean depths. First of all, the galleries were dark, quiet, and peaceful, allowing you to really (pardon the pun) ""immerse"" yourself in the ocean depths that these unique creatures live in. While there were others visiting, they were nowhere near as noisy as the patrons at...other museums...helping to really set a nice ""vibe"". The darkness of the rooms, while meant to evoke the depths of the ocean, may be an issue if you've been in the sun all day: my dad bumped into a wall, thinking it was a path. The specimens themselves (stored in glass cases) range from the ""typical"" anglerfish and orange roughy to the bizarre: ""glass ball"" creatures (best way I can describe them), transparent shrimp, and much more. But what perhaps impressed me the most was the detail they went to describing each and every specimen: at least a paragraph or more for each one. For someone who appreciates scientific information and interesting details, I really enjoyed the exhibit and afterwards, my appreciation for the deep ocean really grew. Some the specimens can be rather grotesque, as is with many deep-sea animals; it may not be advisable to bring young children to this exhibit.

The other temporary exhibit was a Dreamworks animation gallery, where you could tour through the process animators go through to design their countless animated movies. Fans of Kung Fu Panda, How to Train You Dragon, Madagascar, Shrek, etc. will enjoy the items on display, which include many scale models of characters & buildings used by the animators. There were also computer displays where you could try your hand at animation or experiment with various CGI effects (which I enjoyed). I never really grew up with these films, so it was hard for me to really say ""Wow!"" over this exhibit. But still, a very impressive display, and perfect for the whole family.

Perhaps the only let-down was when we visited the ""ArtScience Galleries"", which are actually inside the ""flower"" of the museum. First of all, it was empty, save for the janitor and one other family. There wasn't really anymore than a short film about ""invention"" and ""innovation"" and that sort of thing (it wasn't even that memorable), and an unimpressive display about well-known inventions and their history. It seemed part of these galleries were closed off for renovation...but still! A very underwhelming end to our visit. At the ticket counter, be sure your ticket includes access to the temporary exhibits--otherwise you will be very disappointed.

All in all, this place was a pleasant surprise, which I find is very rare for a ""new"" Singapore attraction. Obviously this review will become obsolete after new temporary exhibits are installed, but we had a fabulous experience here and would love to visit again--can't wait to see what they have next!"
,,Cool exhibits,5.0,,"Always look out for some discount when you go to the Artscience Museum. Generally, locals pay less. If there are two exhibitions running concurrently, you save on buying combined tickets. Then, there's also special promotions for cards, the most recent of which is NTUC card.

Stop by the lily pond on your way here. Actually you can't miss this pond filled with lilies.

Went for the deep sea and Dreamworks exhibits. Didn't enjoy the deep sea one as much as I thought I would have because the signs weren't very helpful and there was a lot of text laid out unintuitively. The staff who were there lacked energy and enthusiasm.

The Dreamworks exhibit was done better, with lots of pictures and interactive stations. You can play with computers to try a bit of computer animation and sketching. There were also stations to put together flipbooks and other type of animation techniques. All in all, very interactive and fun."
,,Always something happening,5.0,,"We have visited the ArtScience Museum several times over the years and this visit was as good as the previous visits. From shows about Dali, or Van Gough to dreamwork animation, the wonders of the deep to ancient chinese treasure, visiting exhibitions touch on a variety of subjects.
We find it cold inside so take a jacket or wrap.
If visiting singapore, before you book your tickets sign up to the sands rewards program at the shops for entry discount, you will need your passport.
They have great activities for kids to try things from making masks to touch screen interactive presentations. These vary depending on the feature exhibitions.
Definitely family friendly and even the adults can learn a thing or two, at worst its a good way to spend a hot or wet day."
,,Very well done exhibits,5.0,,Each year I am here I visit because the exhibits are outstanding and interesting. This year they had an exhibit about the deep ocean that was remarkable. Well worth a visit any time you are in the city
,,Architecturally stunning and fun for everyone,5.0,,"Location, location, location! The ArtScience Museum is in a tourist area precinct, so once you are here there are so many places to venture. First, you will be impressed with the simply elegant and meditative architecture of the museum. It is simply a marvel to in awe of....the museum had something for everyone and definitely a fun place for families with children. You won't be disappointed!"
,,"Inspiring and wonderful, what a fantastic, imaginative art space!",5.0,,"Art can shine on its own but if it is displayed creatively and the building conspires to add depth, light and interest, it is magical. Loved, loved this place. Go.........there are always at least two different shows / displays. the water feature outside is calming and beautiful too, Get to it by the Helix bridge which joins Marina Bay with Marina south, its a joy to walk over and an engineering delight or just take the MRT."
,,Exquisite exhibits,5.0,,Currently they are having the Deep Exhibition. Very detailed and very illustrative. Price is worth it and definitely learnt a lot from it. The last one my family went was the Lego Brick exhibition. Very well done too. This museum is also built exquisitely and a must to go if in Singapore
,,Very interesting exhibitions,5.0,,The Dreamworks is entertaining for the children. Older children can appreciate them too. There are workshops for the kids. The Deep display is interesting for school going kids. Go on Fridays as it is Family Day. One adult paying ticket and you can bring up to 4 kids for free.
,,interesting displays.Expensive,4.0,,"Located just outside Marina bay sands main building, in a lotus shaped structure. This does not have a permanent exhibition. The two main exhibitions we saw were Dreamworks animation exhibition, which was fabulous. It explained how the various animations were made. There were also computer stations where you could try your hand and animation.
The other was "" the Deep"" which showed sea life from surface to many kilometers down the earth surface. Real fish/ fossills etc. quite facinating.
The third was Singapore Eye, which was so so.
Interesting structure with water flowing from a hollow in the roof, made it appeared that it was raining.
There was almost no crowd on a monday. The entrance tickets were fairly steep."
,,leornado da vinci,5.0,,Thank goodness for Singapore airlines giving us a two for one deal. I've wanted to see in the art and science museum and the Leonardo exhibition was the perfect chance. However I do think that $25 with the discount should be enough to get you into all of the exhibitions. There was an interesting emerging artists exhibition on the 3rd floor but that was even more money. The Leonardo exhibition was very interactive and informative.
,,Go only if you want to visit dream works museum,3.0,,"A treat for an animator student or kids who love to know about animations and how its done.....beautifully done, activity for kids to make thir own flip book, flightbof dragon a wonderful short moie clip experience. Story board writing, expressions drawing and sketches....very neat. We did not viit deep as the live aquarium was better....the gllery dsplay only or enthusiast."
,,Deep Seas,4.0,,"Well planned, well sequenced, well laid out. The movies were well edited. This was the first time I have seen this material stratified by depth layers; which, after spending 2 hours here seemed quite logical. Worth the fee and time."
,,Exhibits change every few months so check back regularly.,4.0,,"We've been to the ArtScience Museum many times and most recently to check out the 'Dreamworks Studios Exhibition' as well the 'The Deep'. I suppose this review should not be about the exhibitions but more of the venue itself. The museum is located prominently in front of MBS and near to the Helix Bridge so you won't miss it whichever way you are coming from. There may be a long queue for tickets so do book them online if possible as there is a separate queue to collect pre-paid tickets. After picking up the tickets, you could take the escalator or elevator down to the exhibition halls. Once inside, be prepared to stay for hours exploring the exhibitions. The museum opens at 10 and closes at 7 (last entry at 6 pm). Just buy the all access pass if you are planning to spend the day there. It's more economical. Locals even get a discount, which explains why we've been there so many times."
,,Overall a bit pricy for what was offered,3.0,,"The ArtScience in Singapur was mostly interesting in form of its architecture. I found the shows ( The Deep / Dreamworks ) both not overly exciting and the permanent contemporary art a little to less.
The concept in that way was not very convincing as none of the shows had the depth you would expect but all were more for quick entertainment than anything else.
Still a fascinating building and nice if you want to get away from the ""bling-bling"" crowd in the mall."
,,Regularly changing good exhibition - The Deep,4.0,,"We stayed at MBS hotel and ArtScience Museum was a stop for our kids and later became ours too. During our visit, The Deep was exhibiting. It was nicely setup with great depth of knowledge and wide variety of real deep sea creatures. A hands on workshop for kids added more memories and kids brought back their artwork as souvenirs. Each exhibition takes around 1 hour, it might be cold for kids if you stay longer."
,,More museum than interactive experience,2.0,,"Highlight was seeing well preserved and many types of deep sea creatures. Anglerfish, eels, crabs, and more sea monsters.

It was a lot of reading and probably too much for young kids. There was some disappointment after the whole visit as there was only use of UV torch lights to shine in some pots (which were set too high for young kids) and the self service art station at the end with upcycled materials and highlighters for them to draw/ make some souvenirs. Felt like someone was missing at this booth to excite and engage the kids to make something they can remember of this visit.

The video show of NAtGeo volcanoes of the deep seem appropriate, yet image quality seem fuzzy at times. Nice spot for kids to relax on the big cushions.

Had it not been my son's keen interest in the deep sea creatures we would have exited the darkened exhibition in less than 10mins. Feels like a missed opportunity to excite the visitors, felt too much information and too little experience. Even the deep sea craft kit for anglerfish (to make a paper hat with angler fish) didn't excite him. Was $4. He wanted something that he can touch learn and play.

Art science museum location is great, the museum itself is beautiful with purple lotus on lily pads at the entrance.

Photography allowed, just no flash."
,,The Deep,1.0,,"Absolutely awful. Empty pots and dead fish, all brown. Waste of money. Too much to read and would have been better with sound and some colour."
,,Beautifully designed & curated shows in a beautiful setting,5.0,,"I studied photography and wanted to check out some exhibitions while in Singapore so I bought tickets to both of the main exhibitions on show at the ArtScience; National Geographic's photography showcase and Essential Eames. We went to the photography show first which was in the basement and I was completely blown away with how gorgeous the entire show was. Of course it helps that the photography was amazing but the layout and interactivity of the show was so impressive, you were able to listen to accounts from the photographers themselves about the people, animals and environments in the photographs and how they came about - it was all too easy to be completely sucked into it, we really had to drag ourselves away from it to go to the next exhibition! It was on the top floor in a circular space which was equally well designed and really interactive. It was a total contrast to the style of exhibition seen in the other space which was mostly dark with spotlit photography, quite atmospheric. The second was brightly lit, very colourful and in the spirit of the designers Eames' work, very playful! We left as the gallery closed and sat outside by the fish ponds and calm waters as the sun set over the Marina - beautiful!"
,,Deep Sea Exhibition,4.0,,"This exhibition got me excited as I've always been a fan of deep sea creatures and it's amazing that these mysterious creatures which I only get to see on TV are brought to 'live' in this exhibition. The specimens are well preserved, and I think it's really interesting how the exhibit make use of the luminous effect to present some of the specimens (look in the pots in the first zone-or see photos attached, they are stunning!) Look forward to more exhibits like this!"
,,"Little art, little science",1.0,,"Went with my son to an exhibition there, finished touring in 30mns. The building is nice, but paying this kind of money to see so little inside is just silly. I can't understand why people rate it so high? Are they all working for it? or maybe they never been to a museum of their life."
,,Incredible building lacking exhibitions,3.0,,"On my visit only two floors of exhibitions were open; these were definitely pushing the art and science boundaries and most were not to my taste. Two new exhibitions will be open in the next fortnight (""Deep Sea, Deamworks Animations) which I wish I could have seen. I visited the ArtScience Museum on the first of the month so entry to a nominated exhibition was complimentary. I would recommend the tourist check the website for the current exhibitions and their cost before deciding to travel to the museum. I did enjoy photographing the magnificent museum building and the water lilies in the ponds outside. The Bayfront MRT Station provides easy access to this site."
,,Great building,3.0,,"We like this unique and modern building. The lotus garden outside is soothing you. But we were unable to enjoy much more than we expected. Maybe because we are not into modern arts and the entrance fee is a bit pricey. For those who do, this museum might offer you with unique art works and taste."
,,Di Vinci Exhibit,4.0,,"While in Singapore we went to check out the Art Science Museum as they held the Di Vinci exhibit. The museum is located on the other side of the Gardens by the Bay. Use the Marina Bay MRT station exit and head towards the upper level so the Marina Bay Shopping Complex. The exit to the museum is located towards the quieter end of the complex. If you search the shopping directory for Cash Exchange (there is only one in this large shopping centre), you will be near the exit.

The entrance to the museum is near the base of a building the shape of a lotus. Entry fee will depend on the exhibit at the time and you will be offered a chance to purchase combined exhibition tickets. All in all, educational museum with many things to see and do."
,,Good place more than i expected,5.0,,"We didn't have any idea of this museum though,we really enjoyed with new arts ,structures and goods which artists made. Especially,ping ponp table was fantastic lol. I hope you will try that if you have 2 chance to go."
,,"Great building, some good installations",4.0,,"The staff were so incredibly moody at this venue I almost didn't go any further. We were given a look as if to say 'how dare you interrupt our conversation'. Given that we were the only visitors at that time, this was a very surprising attitude. We visited the gallery, was very good, some varied exhibits. Would go back for more if there was a larger exhibition on, try not to get put off by the awful service."
,,"Great outside, fascinating inside",4.0,,"I always enjoy Singapore and totally disagree with the school of thought that it's ok for a day or two on the way to somewhere else but any longer you would run out of things to do. I visit several times a year and always find lots to see and do. So my advice is always get out there and get into the place. You might be surprised.

The Marina Bay Sands complex is astonishing. The architecture is stunning especially the already iconic hotel with its eye-popping pool on top but there are other facilities within the the precinct that make it well worth a visit.

On all my visits I had never been to the ArtScience Museum. I had seen it's fantastic, almost flower-like building many times from the outside but had never ventured within so I was pleased when a local friend suggested we go there recently.

On this day there were two main exhibitions. A touring pay exhibition of models of Leonardo's machines and the free to enter Prudential Singapore Eye. I am always happy to pay for a stunning blockbuster but the exhibition with the slightly curious name won my vote.

There is a whole range of activities celebrating Singapore's 50th anniversary and this is one of them. A large survey exhibition of the best contemporary art to be seen in Singapore right at this minute, with artists coming from Singapore, Korea, Japan, Malaysia and Indonesia. It's a strong group with some very fine art.

I have a particular interest in contemporary art, especially from South East Asia, so this exhibition was a great find for me. It includes works that cover the ambit of mediums popular at present so there's lots of colour and quite a bit of movement. Throughout though there are also some very deep and important comments, observations and issues being raised by the artists that give the exhibition much of its depth and gravitas.

The gallery spaces of the ArtScience Museum naturally reflect to a degree the building's exteriors and this means you walk through a half-circle series of large galleries that are very far removed from the standard box shape that many contemporary art spaces employ. This in no way detracts from this exciting exhibition but does dictate a particular style of installation that may not suit the purists. Still, having said that, there are people who don't like the curved corkscrew walls of Frank Loyd Wright's original Guggenheim in New York either so, like they say, you can't please all of the people all of the time.

The ArtScience Museum is interesting and exciting to visit I suspect at any time but especially if you have the chance to see this current exhibition."
,,Da Vinci: Shaping The Future,5.0,,"Second time here and have to say they do have some really good exhibitions. This time I went to the amazing exhibition of Da Vinci which I enjoyed very much. The only minus was that they failed to control a child from a Chinese family who was making so much noise and running around in the museum. Very annoying.

After that, I went to the top floor for the Prudential Singapore Eye exhibition, which was also very good.

Worth the expensive price of the ticket."
,,For those who are interested - focus on Da Vinci,4.0,,"The Da Vinci exhibition is worth a visit, for those who have some level of interest in his other work and not just paintings. Really reveals what a multi talented and multi faceted personality Da Vinci was. There is an exhibit titled ""projection of the last supper"" which was the best part in the whole exhibition according to me. Some inter active exhibits so that the kids don't get too bored. Its really cold inside - and I wish I had checked the other reviews which mentioned this - you need a jacket or a sweatshirt once you are inside."
,,Waste of time and money,1.0,,went explicitly for dinosaur exhibit and was not told by local staff that it had been replaced by DaVinci exhibit - was specially told it was still there. Waste of money don't go!
,,An excellent museum,5.0,,"This is the large, white lotus-flower shaped construction forming part of the enormous shopping/dining/gambling complex attached to MBS. We didn't have a lot of time, but had a good look at the design before going through the Darwin exhibition. This exhibit is quite extensive and well curated and certainly worth the entry cost, which is discounted if you're staying at MBS. To do this exhibit justice requires at least three hours. Be warned though, it is really cold inside and the lighting (because of the sensitivity of many of the items on display) is very low."
,,Da Vinci exhibit superb....the rest a downer,3.0,,"Appalling ticketing. You'd swear the three ticket sellers (all looking the other way behind their ""closed"" signs on the day I went) were in charge of a space launch. Lots of people sdtanding around, all nicely uniformed but offering no explanation of poor services. And why all the crazy range of admission prices on both sides of a fee information brochure? Maybe they want everyone to book on line and then the staff would have a real excuse for standing around doing nothing.

Wonderful looking building but the centre atrium a mess of scaffolding and cement with no work in progress. Understand maintenance is necessary but what a sight!

Da Vinci exhibition a treat but was really the only thing worth seeing."
,,DaVinci,4.0,,"Only saw the DaVinci Exhibition, it was very interesting and its well worth going to see if you have the time during your stay in Singapore"
,,So much to see,5.0,,We only had time for the da Vinci exhibition. There is so much to see and do here and inspiring to see art and science come together
,,Disappointing DaVinci,2.0,,The museum itself is nice but the DaVinci exhibit was not very engaging or interesting. You could probably get more out of a book or Wikipedia.
,,"OK, but a bit expensive",3.0,,"It's helpful to realize that this is a profit-making venture by the Sands gambling conglomerate, which probably explains the higher prices. The museum itself is fairly standard, and of course the exhibits change periodically. It's not anything to get too excited about, but it may be worth a stop if you have the time."
,,An very good Museum,4.0,,"This museum was opened in 2011. Through its programmes and exhibitions the museum shows how the world around us is transformed by art, science, culture and technology. Could see the exhibition ""DA VINCI: SHAPING THE FUTURE."" Original masterpieces of Leonardo da Vinci were displayed. The exhibition displayed the five key areas of his mastery viz. mathematics, natural sciences, architecture, technology and music. It also showed his fascination with nature. Original paintings by the School of Leonardo were displayed."
,,One of my favorite museum!,5.0,,"It's been quite a while since my last visit. I visited this museum several times and had become one of my reason to come to Singapore for the last couple of years. I love their past exhibitions such as the Titanic, Salvador Dali, National Geographic, Anna Leibovitz, and many more. It was well displayed, using the experience-based approach, easy for the eyes and acommpanied by interesting facts and information. To walk through the exhibition was like a journey through times.

The ticket price was quite high. But it was worth for the main exhibition. I usually buy the ticket for several exhibitions and get discounted price. I also avoided to come in weekend so it doesn't get too crowded.

I haven't come to their Da Vinci exhibition yet. Haven't got the time to make another trip to Singapore. But I have been dying to see it since they announced it last year. Hope I can get there soon :)"
,,well designed art museum,5.0,,Art museum have alot of new exhibits . the state of art exhibition hosted in the musuem are titanic and harry potter
,,Amazing architecture and exhibits,5.0,,"I suggest that travellers to Singapore check out what is on at the ArtScience Museum to see if there is something that piques their interest. When we were recently in Singapore they had a da Vinci exhibition focusing on the Codex Atlanticus, da Vinci’s largest notebook. It was amazing. Well worth the visit even just for the architecture and surrounds."
,,Cool design and layout,5.0,,"We visited this museum to see the ""Da Vinci: Shaping the Future Exhibit."" The museum is a really cool design and worth checking out itself. The exhibit was terrific, though honestly overwhelming in its scope. There were about 10-12 different rooms featuring Da Vinci's work, and by the end you are a bit tired and cold. Bring a sweater as the air conditioning gets to you pretty quick, and make sure to be efficient when walking through the exhibit to avoid fatigue! All in all a fantastic experience, though!"
,,Really great museum in a fab spot,5.0,,"We went to the recent dinosaurs exhibition at the ArtScience Museum and it was brilliant. The museum is very new, well curated, a reasonable entry fee and right next to the MBS, Marina, Helix Bridge and Gardens by the Bay so plenty in the area to explore before and after your visit. The building itself is a sight to behold, amazing architecture (just one of the crazy buildings in Sg!) so have your camera ready."
,,never fail to amazed me!,4.0,,"Da Vinci is just amazing!!! eyes opening at every corner!!! might be a little dull for some as it is more on his theories and ideas. Not recommended for young children. It is quite annoying too when young kids running around while parents are going through the exhibition. Exhibition like this should be peaceful in order to allow those who are really interested in the topic to go through everything one by one.

Some of the hands on corner should set a time limit for every try. Wanted to try building the bridge without nail but couple before us took too long and refuse to give up. Probably set 10 minutes per try so everyone can have a chance to challenge themselves.

Overall still glad they bring this exhibition over.Looking forward to the next exhibition!"
,,Misleading using Da Vinci name,2.0,,"The advertising and the high price of admission ticket are misleading at least. There was not a single original Da Vinci work of art. There was a lot poor quality xerox copies and wikipedia information printed on walls plus some scaled down wooden models of machinery based of Da Vinci sketches.

Da Vinci must be restless in his grave."
,,Well worth the time,4.0,,I’m not very much for museums but I wanted to see the inside of ArtScience Museum and as DaVinci certainly is one of the all time geniuses I decided to visit the DaVinci exhibition. The exhibition is very interesting and very well presented and in fact I spent much more time there than intended from the beginning. Well worth both the money and the time
,,Excellent insight into Da Vinci,5.0,,"The Da Vinci exhibition, was brilliant and we enjoyed going through the various rooms. The highlight was seeing some of the original manuscripts from Da Vinci. I don't think it's really suitable for young children."
,,Another homerun,5.0,,"This is my 2nd time here and wanted to see both the da Vinci and prudential eye exhibits. The former is excellently laid out with different rooms/sections - architecture, geography, art, weaponry, mathematics etc. Quite a clever way to present the multi-faceted da Vinci. They also had a few rooms for other artists inspired by da Vinci. 1 reviewer gave this excellent museum 1 star and blasted the layout. Poor guy

The prudential eye exhibit seeks to celebrate some good regional artists and there were indeed some interesting installation art, which most were, as opposed to paintings

Looking forward to the next exhibits in July"
,,Great experience!,4.0,,"My sister and I visited the ArtScience Museum whilst staying at Marina Bay and it was a wonderful cultural experience. We went on a Monday morning and it was extremely quiet (we only saw five other tourists when we entered). During the time was the Da Vinci display, which had some original works from some of Da Vinci's sketch books. No real life Mona Lisa, but there were some replicas of his works from other esteemed artists, which were heavily guarded.

There was also a lot of sculptures, interactive features (like iPad activities and games), paintings and photography. Side note: definitely bring a jumper or cardigan because after the first half an hour it gets very chilly due to the intense air-conditioning!

The outside is beautiful too, a view of the bay and some gorgeous water lilies to take photos with! Overall, it was a very educational experience, and a good way to pass the time whilst in Singapore!"
,,Its art time,3.0,,Its located in the lotus hand and depending on which time you go there will be different type of exhibition. when i go its the mummy and the Andy Wahol Things going on. to me its just normal nothing fantastic. but it might be good for people who like exhibition. but its not for me.
,,Da Vinci was so ahead of his time,4.0,,"Being a bit of a mathematician I thought this would be interesting and it really was.

This exhibition lays out simply the way Da Vinci thought and sketched and painted, but just as much the way he thought about the world, connecting light and sound, humans and nature etc.

As other reviews have said, original pages from the Codex are towards the end, but I didn't think that there were going to be his original paintings etc so wasn't disappointed about that.

There are a handful of connected rooms showing exhibits connected to Da Vinci - modern artists using his influence - plus some interactive aspects, including games. On the Sunday we went there were also other science based connections in a room towards the end.

All in all, a really good afternoon.

Just for clarity - Singapore residents / pass holders get discounted access. Also a joint ticket to see some modern art installations etc only cost a couple of bucks more."
,,a waste of time and money,1.0,,"This is the worst ""science"" museum I have ever seen. The ticketing staff was incompetent, the layout of the Da Vinci exhibit was confusing and the content was mostly facsimiles of his work. There were about 10 pages of his original notes from Codex Atlanticus and that the only interesting room in the entire building.
This exhibit is not a worthy representation of one of the greatest minds that ever was.
Don't waste your time and money here. The Mediterranean restaurant next door is a better place to visit.
Horrible. Just horrible."
,,Da Vinci: Shaping the Future,5.0,,"Excellent Exhibition! This is an unusual, fascinating presentation of Leonardo da Vinci with a focus on his mathematical and engineering genius as much as his paintings. The exhibition includes original painting, working models and Codex Atlanticus pages. Certainly well worth a visit, but take a cardigan, some rooms are quite cold!"
,,Enjoyed the Da Vinci exhibition,4.0,,"I am a ""fan"" of Da Vinci so I made sure I visited the place , even though my holiday was short. There are some nice models and a nice video presentation of the Last Supper. However , to me the most valuable thing was to see about twelve of the original manuscripts from the Codex atlanticus. Don't be dismayed by the initial pages being copies, towards the end, you will see the real thing."
,,Must go for Museum Go-er,4.0,,"If you are a museum go-ers, this is one of the museum you do not want to missed. But before coming check out the exhibition that's going on currently as the catch of this museum is that they have a lot of special exhibitions that are on only for a specific period. The standard exhibition itself is not interesting at all...
I just visit the museum for Leonardo Da Vinci exhibition it's so informative that I can't even digest all the information however a great eye opener too...
1 think to note is that the ticket price is rather costly compared to the other museums. But it never fail to impress me with the special exhibition."
,,Waste of money,1.0,,"I came to ""Da Vinci"" exhibition. Ticket cost was 23$. The whole exhibitions was - reprints of Da Vinci dairy and some contemporary ""art"" about it. No one original work of Da Vinci. Nothing interesting. Total waste of money. If I wanted to see copies of his dairy, I have internet to found it and not to pay such a money."
,,"Da Vinci Exhibition, not worth your time & money",2.0,,"I lived in Indonesia, a short-flight away from Singapore. ArtScience Museum is my ""must-visit"". Always brought my children along to their exhibits and so far, our favourite was the ""Titanic"". That exhibition left my children wondering for days how this tragedy happened. That, is a perfect example of a successful exhibition. Therefore, I was so excited for the Da Vinci Exhibition and looking forward to introduce Da Vinci to my children. I must say, that exhibit was a terrible disaster! They were not able to make a connection between the object of the exhibit (in this case, Da Vinci) and the audiences (me, my husband & my children). Yes, my children have heard and learned about Da Vinci so they had a few things in their mind about this magnificent man (hey, my 10 yo son already made a recreation of Da Vinci's archimedes screw). But still, they didn't understand anything and learned anything new! Such a waste of money and what a terrible way to ""honour"" Da Vinci!"
,,DaVinci Exhibition,3.0,,"A bit ho hum. I paid the entrance fee and raced through it. Bit of a waste of money. There was another exhibition, it made little or no impression on me either."
,,beautiful museum,4.0,,"I like museum and I enjoy this one.
only one floor open.

interesting design of building and beautiful outdoor deco.
entry fee is a bit expensive but worthy it.
I went to the Da Vinci show and it was amazing.
staff are nice and got interesting games.
photos are allows in most of the area with no flash.

in general, it's a really nice and organised place for having exhibition.~"
,,Interesting Exhibitions,4.0,,"The design of the building is amazing, a work of art. The museum itself is quite small, but with some interesting exhibits. When we were there, it was an exhibition of some Chinese artists, which was very good. There were also some interactive displays on the top floor, which was fun and informative."
,,"Overpriced, but decent quality museum experience",3.0,,"I visited the ArtScience Museum on 13JAN2015 by myself. The Da Vinci exhibit is currently there, with many original paintings and pages from his large volume of work. They paid homage to the various contributions he had over his lifetime. And they had some neat additions from other current artists that use Da Vinci as inspiration.

And that's it.

The museum is quite small. And the whole Da Vinci exhibit was located in the basement. And that was it. For S$25 I was hoping for more. What's there is great quality, informative and interesting. But there really isn't much. I was there for about 90 mins, and that was very slowly going and reading every bit that was available.

My recommendation is to go if you aren't on a budget, nor have anything better to do. If you enter with the right expectations you may have a better experience than I did. I think I was just a bit disappointed since the TripAdvisor pictures had dinosaur fossils, and I just really dig fossils."
,,Da Vinci Exhibit is wonderful,5.0,,Worth the money really - very insightful exhibit covering the life and works of Da Vinci. Amazing showcase of original pages from Codex Atlanticus! Photography is allowed for most of the exhibit but no flash. Areas where original paintings from Da Vinci's school are featured obviously you can't take photos in. In fact two guards would watch over guests to make sure they behaved =)
,,Da Vinci exhibit great,4.0,,"I am not a huge fan of museums, but enjoyed this one. The building is beautiful, a work of art on its own. There wasn't a lot in the museum other than the special exhibit, which was Da Vinci. That was amazing - they have managed to fuse art and science together perfectly. I didn't realise until this experience how alike they can be - both requiring intelligence, vision and creativity. As well as perseverance and a quest for understanding. Enlightening and fun - time well spent."
,,"The Building or the exhibition, your pick, your rating",4.0,,"Been there yesterday with my two kids and wife.

The exhibit is currently on Leonardo Da Vinci, which is fascinating before you enter the door. But it was not... All replicas and facsimiles, not a single original being shown. There is a serious way finding issue with the Museum, leading you to dead ends and coming back through the exhibit in order to exit (!), regardeless it was worth the S$25 ticket.

But let's talk about the building, hence that was the sole reason we paid the ticket. Moshe Safdie's design is outstanding, an architectural wonder both outside and inside. Resembles Oscar Niemeyer's MAC in Rio in someway but is magnificently well built.

Highly recommend it if you're an architect, interior designer or simply someone who admires great design."
,,Not so special.,3.0,,"good: in front of Marinabay sands hotel. and Marina square
It was possible to arrive by boats from Merlion park (SD$ 5)
Architecture was wonderful looking as lotus.

Bad: When we arrived at July 2014, contents was not sufficient."
,,Amazing architecture,4.0,,"The museum is an exhibition in itself. The building is worth seeing, beautiful design and architecture. We saw a photography exhibit. It was a good showing of photographers from around the world."
,,"Worth visiting over and over, and over again",5.0,,"The exhibitions are consistently being updated, and each exhibition is always unique and educational. I have seen the shipwreck, Andy Warhol, dinosaurs, mummy, and the latest Da Vinci exhibition, and all have impressed me.

The look of the building itself is amazing, and really adds to the beautiful skyline in the area.

I'd say, go in with the intention of educating yourself and learning, give yourself at least 2 hours to walk and read the captions, and you will love this place."
,,the new museum,4.0,,This is a great museum for catching the latest exhibition. The staff are friendly and helpful and this museum has some of the best exhibits around. Great both for kids and adults.
,,Nice museum but a bit disappointed with the hands on display,3.0,,"I had previously visited the titanic exhibition and it was a good experience. Seeing that they brought the Da Vinci's codex exhibition, I was veryvexcited to bring my family to view it. Although generally the exhibition was really informative and good, I was disappointed that a few of the hands on display was not in working condition. Also, if you enjoy viewing the exhibitions in a quiet environment, advisable to go in the weekdays. There's a guided tour in the weekends, done in both mandarin and English, at selected timings but it just seems like the guide rushed thoroughbred exhibits to me. They are also bringing in more of Da Vinci's codex in February so you might want to wait till then. There is a promotion if you go now where you'll get a limited edition coke bottle designed in a Christmas theme.

There is a current promotion where you can go for 2 exhibitions, Da Vinci and photography, for a good rate. This museum trip is good for a half a day trip.

You can drop off at Bayfront train station and walk through the marina bay sands shopping areas get through the museum. If you drop off at Promenade station, it's short maybe 10-15 mind walk through the Helix bridge."
,,Some of the best exhibits in Asia,5.0,,"To get to see the photos of Anne Liebowitz, the works of Dali and the works of Andy Warhol all in one year isn't a regular feat for an asian country. Singapore's govt spend the time and money to have this happen. And this is a museum built at par with any in the world for its architecture and the way it is run efficiently."
,,Davinci is average but rest was good,4.0,,"Oceans of possibility was interesting as were some of the other photo exhibits.

However the da Vinci exhibit really comes up short. It primarily contains parts from his codex but that very quickly becomes repetitive and unengaging since you are staring at mainly illegible pages.
It's interesting to see a few. But more variety of his work would be better.

Previously when titanic was there it was well done. So overall the goodness depends on how well they curated the exhibition.

Tips
- I went when it opened in the morning and it was nice and crowd free.
- After you visit head into the mall for a bit and then some shopping."
,,Good exhibition halls and careful setup,4.0,,"I have been here several times to view different exhibits. First of all, I really like it that locals enjoy a lovely percentage discount- it makes you feel a sense of belonging finally (and probably the only place that gives such perks to us).

Secondly, the exhibits are always so well organised and beautiful - the details are informative in nature, and the exhibits are well displayed in clarity as well as aesthetically gorgeous.

Today I went to watch the Da Vinci exhibition, and was once again blown away by the care segmentation of the entire show - it was fabulous and left me feeling like I was literally transported back in time.

This is a place that everyone should visit.

,,Worth coming for an hour,3.0,,"interesting place. The building itself is interesting, shaped like put a hand or Lotus flower. There was a really interesting display of Chinese art, one set which was subtly animated and presented on large TV screens. Really innovative and enjoyable to check out. I do get the feeling they could do more with the space they have available, it was pretty much the Chinese art and a photography exhibition. There were other areas pretty much unused. There was an interesting audiovisual presentation about innovation which was definitely worth seeing."
,,nothing of interesting inside,2.0,,"Even if the position of the museum is fantastic and the building amazing, in my opinion there is really nothing interesting inside."
,,"Excellent architecture, rare collections, but exhibit choices was a tad disappointing",4.0,,"Lacked the depth, wit, and excitement typically associated with such defiant and bold building architecture. The exhibit I viewed was a photography exhibition by world-class lenso-diva Annie Leibovitz. As usual, Annie was amazing! Exhibit pieces selected did come with social intonations of a masculine resurgence, which was hard to miss, but what was not quite pardonable for an exhibition featuring an icon of contemporary photography, whose own life's journey was a human display of all that's fragile and powerful, was that exhibit left out Annie's notoriously famous social statement pieces that launched careers and made hope real."
,,Good value,4.0,,The exhibition was art and science of photography. Runs to 28 december. 200 photos of 34 artists from 21 countries. Stunning and challenging. Good value at sing$ 6. Interactive science on floor above.
,,Great museum,5.0,,The building is a destination in itself. During my visit there was a great photography exhibit and they also had a great free workshop on making cyanotypes. Definitely check this out if you are in town!
,,Great Looking Building,4.0,,"The Lotus Building adjacent to the great design of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, is a great match for the look and the content. Check out the exhibits and make sure that you spend time looking at the building from across the water, as you cross the helix bridge, and from the base. Very well done."
,,Unexpected plus value,4.0,,"The ArtScience museum caught us by surprise having just walked through the Marina Bay mall complex for a view of the city scape. The building design itself is worth a good look , matching as it does the many other wonderful designs around the bay area. We found ourselves at the last day of the ""Flux Realities"" photographic exhibition which was the work original and stimulating contemporary Chinese photographers.
We came back two days later to visit the new exhibition ""An ocean of possibilities"" displaying photographic work from many parts of the world. Again a wonderful collection.
All in all, a stunning building with worthwhile exhibitions at a cost of SG$6 entry with a cool drink included in the gift shop after the viewing. Hard to beat."
,,Great photography exhibitions - highly recommended,5.0,,"Visited on 2 November 2014 to see two photography exhibitions - the first 'Flux Realities - A Showcase of Contemporary Chinese Photography' and the second 'An Ocean of Possibilities'. Unfortunately for readers Flux Realities will have now closed but was a fascinating collection of art - comparing the old and new China, and individual perspectives on life. An Ocean of Possibilities shows photos from around the globe with people making a difference. Great for tweenies and up. Price of admission was $6 for each exhibition which is excellent. Disappointed that there was no merchanise for the Flux exhibition and the book for 'An Ocean of Possibilities' was ridiculously priced ($80). But enjoy the pics in a spectacular building. Look forward to visiting the next exhibition Da Vinci later this month - entrance for this is around $25 I believe. Highly recommended"
,,Interesting Building - Nice Exhibit and Staff,5.0,,"The building itself is a sight to see. Shaped like a lotus, resting off of the ground, the shape and structure is amazing. Entering at ground level, you are not sure what to expect. Once selecting your tour of choice, you take the elevator up to the area of exhibits. As expected it is a circular layout which just continuously flows. You don't even realize you've made it all the way around based on the nature of the exhibits.

The museum shop is in the basement level so you can take the elevator all the way down to check it out. The staff was extremely nice and efficient.

The exhibit at the time was Annie Leibovitz. Being from the US it was interesting to see a US photographers exhibit in Asia.

The area around the museum is also very nice and well kept (no surprise there) and the lily pond is beautiful and stocked with fish!

NOTE: If you are a tourist and have a Marina Sands Rewards card use it for a discount on your admission!"
,,Lotus on the Marina,5.0,,"The building itself is an incredible design just like most of Singapore itself especially down by the Marina. The Annie Leibovitz exhibition was fantastic - what an amazing photographer and woman.
This visit made a pleasant change from the business of the streets and malls of Singapore."
,,Lotus shaped building,3.0,,space for arts to display their photographs and paintings...building from outside is amazing....visit depends on the shows and exhibitions that are going on...if not a good place for taking a picture.
,,Noisy and unorganized,1.0,,"Pretty common in Singapore but was amazed by the inefficiency there. 10 people at the cashiers, 3 clients before me and took me 30 minutes to get in. Shortest expo ive done in my life. Massive construction work going on at that time (was not told) that made it a pain throughout the entire visit."
,,Very pleasant,5.0,,"Intresting building in Marine Bay area. I saw Annie Leibovitz-exhibition, which was great. Museum is quite small. A great and inexpensive thing to do in otherwise expensive city."
,,A Great Setting,4.0,,"The museum might be small by most standards, but it is a destination in itself, just for the design! A big, stubby, concrete lotus in a real lotus pond housing an interesting layout - each gallery room is a wedge around a central column. You go full circle.

We saw the Annie Leibovitz exhibition which we had earmarked before we left Australia, and we were well pleased with what we saw. Having seen the book, it was great to see the actual photographs. Well displayed.

The entry to the museum is rather regimented, with turnstiles - we felt like we were going through security at the airport, minus the x-ray."
,,A weird looking but picture worthy structure,4.0,,We weren't able to enter the museum but the structure alone is already an eye candy. Weird looking structure but beautiful attraction at night -- just beside the Marina Bay Sands hotel :)
,,Interesting building and great exhibitions,4.0,,"We were lucky enough to (unintentionally) visit on a national holiday and as a result, entry was free. It was usually $$23 / £11.50 per person - Price varies depending on the exhibitions.

We saw ""Flux realities"", an exhibition by contemporary Chinese artists and the Annie Leibovitz exhibition. Both were very good.

The building itself is an interesting design - shaped like an open lotus. Worth seeing!"
,,Annie Leibovitz exhibit was ok,3.0,,I had a few hours to visit Singapore by MBS and decided to visit the rate and science center. It looked quite interesting from the outside. They had an exhibit from Annie Leibovitz which I expected would be good. Overall it was ok but I was a bit disappointed. On one side the exhibit itself was a mix of great photos and others of the photograph family... Not much better anyone else family album... On the other the building from the inside is not exceptional. A few interesting rooms but not as great as from the outside. Unless the next exhibit is great I would recommend to skip and just take nice pictures from the outside.
,,Perfect For kids,5.0,,The place is very informative and the displays are interesting. We'll definitely recommend to friends who have children to bring their child to this place
,,Love the photography exhibition: Annie Leibovitz A Photographer's Life 1990-2005,4.0,,"I visited the museum by surprise and had a great time at the Annie Leibovitz A Photographer's Life 1990-2005 exhibition. The building itself is already an interesting attraction. A pond that surrounds the building nurses a large amounts of lotus. I had my sandwich at the noon time sitting in the shade by the pond and enjoyed the breeze and the view to the city.

The fees to the exhibitions varies. To enjoy the time by the lotus pond, free of charge."
,,A little small but worth the trip,4.0,,"Located in the heart the Marina Bay Sands, the ArtScience Museum is much more art than it is science. Exhibit I went to see was the science of photography, but was just a keyur photo exhibit from famous photographer. The $15 entry fee, get you into a very modern building that is supposed represent a lotus. While the architecture is beautiful it restricts the limit of what the museum can actually show."
,,brilliant concept,5.0,,"When I went there was a photographer exhibition which was excellent - the rooms are open, bright and the spacing is just right. Clever design and it works well."
,,Leibovitz Alive!,5.0,,"We came straight from the Sebastiao Salgado Exhibition at the Singapore Museum to the Leibovitz and the contrast could not have been greater. While Salgado's work ranged from close-ups of native tribes to wildlife and vast expanses of landscape, Leibovitz's work was very much more personal and intimate, covering images of her family and her relationship with Susan Sontag. These images, along with those of celebrities for which she is probably more usually known, give a wonderful insight into the life and work of one of the worlds best known photographers.

Interestingly both photographers worked a great deal in black and white and it made for an interesting comparison is terms of composition and exploitation of textures, lighting and form, but again, the Leibovitz works were infinitely more intimate and revealing. If anything it provided viewers with a much deeper understanding of the life and times of a truly fascinating artist, as this exhibition is intended to be.

A number of Leibovitz landscapes especially stood out in stark contrast to those of Salgados. For while the latters work includes the use of helicopters and what one imagines must be weeks if not months of planning and logistics, as well as lots of waiting for the right moment and interaction with native tribes, Leibovitz's simple documentation of what her eye picked up at a particular moment in time seemed somehow more honest and certainly more spontaneous. This element coupled with her obvious technical skill and talent make for some truly memorable images. Do take the time to ponder the images taken of her family at the beach, for example. The sheer energy and fun captured by her lens is truly remarkable.

This forum could not possibly do justice to the body of work showcased at the 'Annie Libovitz, A Photographers Life 1990-2005' so go check it out! Well worth the S$15 entrance fee!"
,,Annie Leibovitz exhibit is a must see,4.0,,"My wife and I were lucky enough to get in to see the exhibit for free thanks to the Singapore Day celebration. Otherwise the entrance fee is S$23/pax
The exhibit is a must-see even for non-photography enthusiast. Her portraits are amazing, but her natural candid was even better.
We especially love how she captured her parents on holiday with their grand children."
,,Dinosaur experience,5.0,,"That specific period they had different themes, and you could pay/pick what you like. Chose dinosaur experience, our son is beg. of his teens, so very keen to learn. Great set up, got discount due to stay at Marina Bay Sand Hotel."
,,Good but pricey,3.0,,"I visited the ArtScience Museum during the last 2 days of the Dinosaurs: Dawn of Extinction which was very interesting. The exhibit was well organized with many interactive features as well as audiovisual aids. The Dinosaurs show was just finished and I enjoyed and learned a lot from it. Guided tour is provided around 11.30am and 2.30pm and last for 1 hour which I believe they will continue with the upcoming feature after the Dinosaurs. If you arrive around those timing, I recommend you to join it as the staff was very knowledgeable.

The only problem is the admission fee is SGD28 for two exhibits: the Dinosaurs and work of renowned photographer whose name I unfortunately cannot recall. Compared to other museums in Singapore this fee is at least 2-3 times higher. And they allow only ""one"" time entry per exhibit so if you enter one you have to remain in there and finish it in one go which is not convenient as some may need to leave to grab some food and re-enter to continue the exploration but apparently you cannot do it here.

Tip: eat before entering"
,,Dinosaur and history,4.0,,"Good to bring ur child here. To teach them about all kind of dinosaurs, habitat etc. In this museum also have lil fun game to kid so they can distraction from being bored. Im forget about the price for the ticket. But if I have suggest u... come to this museum after 12 o'clock why???? After enjoying see all dinosaur u still can see sunset in marina bay sand..."
,,The Annie Leibovitz exhibition a must see,5.0,,The Annie Leibovitz exhibition is a must see for anyone interested in photography. What an amazing insight into her fascinating life. The building itself is an interesting piece of architecture with much more space on the inside than expected from the outside. The lily pond makes for pretty surrounds.
,,ArtScience Museum in July 2014,4.0,,Your trip here will depend entirely on the current exhibits. We were lucky enough to have the amazing Dinosaur exhibit (which was great for my son) and the fantastic Photography exhibit (great for my husband!) The building itself is very interesting and should at least be seen from the outside. Check out what exhibits are on during your visit and you might luck out with something great!
,,Visit the dinosaur exhibition,5.0,,"The art science museum is a fantastically designed building, both inside and out. I am quite fascinated by dinosaurs and had heard the exhibition was good so thought it would be an idea to check it out. I was not disappointed! The exhibition was very well laid out, allowing you to walk around in chronological order from the beginning of life to the extinction of the dinosaurs. They cater to the interests of all ages by including interactive displays, written text and informative videos. There are also hundreds of model dinosaurs/fossils which are well presented and great to look at. I would definitely recommend this exhibition, even to people who may not naturally be interested in dinosaurs as it is lots of fun. Unlike many museums I have previously been to, it was uncrowded, which aided the experience. The price is relatively reasonable at 25 SGD and even if you don't enjoy it, at least you can walk around in the air-conditioning for an hour or so!"
,,A first-rate museum,5.0,,"Or, at least their current dino-exhibition is a first rate museum exhibition that has a story to tell and tells it in a focused, breautiful and easy-to-follow way. Why are not all museums like this?

Oh, and the building is completely crazy, shaped like a giant flower. You have to take the elevator frim the ground level to the top and look out while going up. It is a one-of-a-kind experience."
,,Spectacular from the Outside; Splendid from Within,4.0,,The Marina Bay Sands Art-Science Museum was not on my hop-in list when I was planning for Singapore. So I went to visit the Marina Square on this fine afternoon and a lot of hoppers nearby referred me to visit this place if I had time. I went close to the place and realized that they have a show on Dinosaur's Evolution. I hopped in there without any more confusion and I must admit that I was quite astonished not to have this in my regular list for places to see in Singapore. This place has a fee and it varies by which portion of the museum you decide to visit. I took the Dino show only and it costed me about 25 SGD. I had fun and I would recommend this place to specially parents with small kids.
,,Fascinating place to visit,4.0,,"We had to go inside his building that is so amazing outside. It is primarily used for travelling or temporary exhibitions, rather than permanent ones, and they had two when we were there, Dinosaurs and Annie Liebowitz. We chose just the latter, partly because our time was short and partly because we feel we have ""done"" dinosaurs. The Leibowitz was excellent. I wouldn't call this a must see sight in Singapore, but it is an amazing building, and well worth going to if the current exhibition is of interest.

It has no food available on-site but the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands complex are 1 minute away."
,,Arty Annie at Art Museum,4.0,,Saw the Annie Liebovitz exhibition. Excellent. Very good value at S$12.80 per adult. Staff were friendly and helpful. Building and exhibition well laid out. Took quite awhile to get round all the 200 photographs. What a talented person! Only negative was access to the toilets - down in the bowels of the building with only stair access. Thought there would be a lift!
,,Very Nice Exhibits. Beautiful Building.,4.0,,We spent hours at this beautiful building at Marina Bay Sands catching up on the Dinosaurs & Annie Leibowitz shows. Very informative and an extremely fun afternoon. The facility is top notch as are the exhibits. We even loved the multimedia multiscreen presentation on the 3rd floor where they gave us an insight into what made them create the Art Science museum.
,,"Nice, modern, photogenic museum",4.0,,"Located in a modern, photogenic building, the museum is located in direct proximity to Marina Bay Sands hotel. It features changing exhibitions. Depending on the type of exhibition (recent ones included topics like Lego, mummies, dinosaurs...) this is a good place to visit for families with kids. The ArtScience Museum is bigger from the inside than it looks like from outside. The lily pond outside is nice to see. Discounts apply for Singapore residents, so if you reside in Singapore, don't forget to bring your identity card."
,,Sunk in the Most Stunning Ambiance,5.0,,"I arrived at the museum at 6:30, 1 hour and a half away from closing. Before, I had decided to go for both exhibition but the reception advised me just to visit one because they would be closing soon and the Dinosaur would take 1-hour-visit and I would not spend enough time for Annie's. So I decided to visit the Dinosaur Exhibition only as it was the one that took my interest and I didn't want to go on a rush through the exhibition, which was a very irresponsible thing to do while visiting a museum.

The exhibition had a great effect on me, it was very informative and lively. They even had 3D walking sculpture of the T-rex. They also included a battle scene of two dinosaurs which were very fascinating. I really adore how informative they were, providing me both old and new knowledge.This place is very suitable for children and students to explore the dinosaurs with interactive mini game in the exhibition like the memory game when they compare the ancestor of bird and modern bird. The exhibition offered us the chance to touch on varied types of skins and bones, and look into the eye of the prehistoric creatures. It was an awesome experience.

As it was almost the end of the exhibition, it will end in July, most of the souvenirs were on sale. You should check out those goodies. I got my self a triceratops stuff animal and a key charm. I hope they will put on a more interesting exhibition after this so I can pay a visit to Singapore annually. This museum is the top attraction that will seduce me on and on."
,,Stunning and awe-inspiring,5.0,,"The design and amazingness of this building nearly far-outwighed the exhibition. Nestled in Marina Bay, The ArtScience Museum deserves a visit during the day and the night."
,,Great Annie Leibovitz Exhibition,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed the Annie Leibovitz a Exhibition at the Art and Science Museum. What an amazing life she has led. The family photos were just as enlightening as her landscapes, war photo's and the Rich and Famous."
,,Dawn of dinosaurs,5.0,,"I visited the dawn of dinosaurs exhibition in the art science museum today. The building itself is fascinating but inside was even more impressive. If you are in anyway curious about biology and history I would highly recommend it. Full genuine fossils and lots of information on the dinosaurs themselves, along with methods used to extract bones and use them as pieces of a puzzle to recreate the dinosaur. It was a mixture of history, palaeontology, biomechanics, engineering and history. Fascinating and we'll worth the money."
,,Annie Leibovitz Photographers Life,5.0,,"I changed my mind and landed up going to see this Exhibition of Annie Leibovitz and really glad I did. Amazed at the shots that were taken I felt Like i was in Hollywood for a few minutes , so close to some amazing actors...its a must

Finishes on the 19th October 14"
,,Interesting building,5.0,,"This is a fascinating building entwined in the Marina Bay Sands complex. Externally it is a cool piece of architecture with a very modern entrance allowing access to the main exhibition floors.

I've seen a few grumpy reviews but really this is an interesting building that will be more often that not judged by the quality of the collections shown. I saw the Annie Leibovitz exhibition which was excellent."
,,dont waste your time,2.0,,"Having had to realise through the mall to get to the so called museum,I was extremely unhappy to be told that I could not go in for another 90 minutes,and only then if I paid 15 singapore dollars to see a show.why call yourself a museum if you are not."
,,We had a roaring good time.,4.0,,"Loved the dinosaur exhibit with our 3 and 5 year old. They learnt a little and had fun too. I loved the photography exhibit. The circular building really lends itself to art exhibits as it takes you on a journey through the pictures.

Stunning building. Well worth a visit."
,,Noteworthy as a building,3.0,,"As another reviewer mentioned, it's a nice building for taking photos, but whether it's worth paying to enter and see the exhibitions depends on what's on at the time and your personal interests. I went to see the dinosaur exhibit which was pretty cool and informative. I also went to see the free Nike/football exhibition which was rather disappointing to me (I expected more football and less shoes!).
Something I found extremely perplexing was that although the football exhibit was free, we needed tickets to enter. Okay, fine, maybe they want a way to count how many visitors they had. But they also made us go back down to the ticket counter in the basement to obtain the tickets. There we found that the tickets weren't at the ticket counter but were with a staff member next to it, handing out pre-printed tickets. Then we went back up to the 4th floor, the lady there scribbled on our tickets and we entered. My point is that the staff member guarding the exhibit entrance could very easily be the person in charge of doling out tickets, especially since there was no need for a cash register!"
,,Really depends on the exhibition,3.0,,"The ArtScience Museum is good for photos on the outside but to consider entry into the museum it is only worth it if you are interested in the exhibition they have at that time.

So far, I have only paid for entry twice when they had the following exhibitions
1) Andy Warhol: 15 minutes - quite a good exhibition featuring the artworks and photo collections of the late Andy Wahol.
2) Mummy: Secrets of the Tomb - average exhibition with the usual information on the mummifying process and some real life mummies

Usually I would just bring my overseas friends to just take a photo of the exterior, visit MBS and the Skywalk followed by the helix bridge to the Esplanade. Just for sharing :)"
,,Bones!,4.0,,Dinosaur Exhibition - wonderful for the kids - interesting for the adults. Staff friendly. Bit pricey but very good exhibition. Also Soccer Exhibition at same place - not so great but it's free.
,,Out of this world building for excellent museum,5.0,,"State of the art building, excellent exhibits, inter-active, in this 21st century location @ Marina Bay Sands. Not too exy in a great part of town. Ever evolving, latest exhibitions and something for all the family."
,,Nothing there,1.0,,I spent about 40 dollars for an entrance fee to see the dineuseir exhibition. But it was not worth it. It only took me 30 mins to finish the exhibition and most of the stuff is not real anyway. Way too expensive and it did not worth the money.
,,Consistently Great Exhibits,5.0,,"I can't believe there are so few reviews for the ArtScience museum! Maybe is has to do with a lack of promotion or advertising? Definitely worth going as part of the whole Marina Bay experience.

I visit this place every time I come to Singapore, just to check out the latest exhibitions on show. Kudos to the management for always selecting very interesting collaborations and exhibitions from around the world, and the design layout is almost always perfectly done.

Some of the highlights I remember:
1. DInosaurs: Dawn To Extinction
2. Harry Potter exhibition
3. Mummy: Secrets of the Tomb
3. Lego: Art of the Brick
4. Van Gogh Alive exhibition
5. Dali: Mind of A Genuis

Keep up the good work!"
,,Had an Historical Journey,5.0,,It was an exciting trip where the entire environment took us to an Jurassic period . Really enjoyed it !
,,Dinosaurs: Dawn to Extinction,5.0,,"Of all the dinosaur exhibits I've seen, this was the most artfully put together. The diversity of organisms was really impressive as was the information in their displays. I especially liked how it emphasized the timeline and distinctions between dinosaurs, crocodilians, and synapsids (mammal-like reptiles). I was afraid of yet another childish exhibit but this was pleasantly mature, scientific, and informative, even for someone very knowledgeable about prehistory. They even sold dinosaur textbooks. That said, it was also flexible for children, which I am sure would have enjoyed a lot as well (a museum doesn't need a host of cartoons to keep kids interested; they're there for fossil reconstructions)."
,,Dinosaurs: Dawn to Extinction,4.0,,"Went there with my kids to the Dinosaur exhibition. Overall was a good experience but felt that it was a bit expensive at $20 per adult and $13 per child (2-12). There were some interactive areas and they have an app you can download though it wasn't that immersive.

I would recommend to anyone who likes dinosaurs but if not, you'll have to decide if it's worth $66 to spend 2hrs with your kids learning about dinosaurs."
,,"Nice Modern Architecture, Traveling Exhibits",3.0,,"The Art Science Museum has impressive, modern architecture -- shaped like a lotus flower, it makes for great Singapoer skyline photos. After purchasing tickets, you arrive to the exhibit by elevator, which has glass walls to see out. The interior layout has good flow (which isn't always the case for museums here).

It appears that the Art Science Museum hosts 2 traveling exhibits. I went to the Annie Leibovitz exhibit, which was a collection of her work 1990 - 2005, which reflected some very personal events, as well as her signature celebrity photos. Very good.

If you happen to like the exhibit(s) showing, then go. Otherwise, take photos from outside, and from the helix bridge."
,,Dinosaurs: Dawn To Extinction,5.0,,"We went to the Dinosaurs: Dawn To Extinction exhibit at the ArtScience Museum. It was wonderful but perplexingly empty apart from maybe three other families. It could be the high entry price but for us it was worth it. We spent a good couple of hours at the exhibit and it fuelled many discussions for the rest of the week. A free coke included in your ticket price is a nice touch. It's an amazing building too, worthy of several photographs."
,,Disappointingly small place,2.0,,"There are lots of hype about the museum, innovative shape bla bla, but at the end it is very tiny. There is essentially no permanent exhibition and the temporary ones are indeed very small."
,,Enjoyable and education visit to a very contemporary museum,5.0,,"Came here for the anne leibovitz exhibition. Firstly ,the architecture of the museum is impressive and very contemporary shaped like a lotus emerging from the water. The interior was modern and well designed. WE came for the anne leibovitz exhibition which was a very comprehensive exhibition showcasing her iconic works as well as special pieces not often seen. The layout of the exhibition was well designed and the selection was well curated. It is an lovely experience to have the chance to see which a world class exhibition in this amazing museum located in the marina bay. Well certainly return too visit future exhibitions when we are back in town. Recommended !"
,,Great location and exhibts,4.0,,"We have visited the ArtScience museum a few times, most recently for the Annie Liebowitz exhibition.

The location is superb, alongside the Marina and the Marina Bay Shoppes.

The building itself is shaped, beautifully, like a Lotus flower.

It is not a huge museum but the exhibits change frequently, are well laid out and informative.

the Annie Liebowitz exhibition was great, showing all of her best work, including a video of her work and life.

The usual museum shop at the end of the tour is disappointing - small and with a very small and, largely, uninteresting items. However, the rest of the museum is well worth the time and cost."
,,"Interesting dinosaur exhibit, cool way to spend a couple of hours",4.0,,"Don't judge this exhibit with those found at the Deutsches Museum in Munich and the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. Rather, this somewhat small, but extremely accessible dinosaur museum lets everyone get closer than I've ever seen to the exhibits. Most of the fossils are casts, which takes nothing away from the interest of the exhibit but its the placement in poses and on very low stands to bring them down to (children and adult) eye level that is striking.

There is an app for iOS and Android which can be downloaded (via free Wi-Fi in the lobby) but it seemed more geared to younger people. I thought it streamed commentary about the exhibits but not so. But it did have a lot of text and pictures about the major exhibits. The website also allows you to download before you go

The exhibits are a bit dark, nice and cool, with a few monitors showing interviews with some of the scientists. These will mostly be of interest to the older children and adults. I listened to all of them and they were very interesting

There is also a couple of craft areas for the kids to make paper dinosaurs to take with them and a colouring station to all for tracing of dinosaurs or free colouring. Just the thing for a rambunctious child.

Staff are sprinkled throughout and are eager to answer questions or help with the app."
,,Unforgettable memories,5.0,,The Dinosaurs Dawn to Extinction exhibition over here gave us the insight of the times of evolution which would have taken probably months to read and collect information. The free guided tour in English was so easy and convenient to follow and learn in a such short duration. The facilities are also very good with ease of access for the old and small kids
,,Dino,4.0,,"While wandering around in marina bay shopping mall, saw these dino banners. The expo is awesome. I was pretty impressed by the interactivity and interaction with the visitors. Wifi and a special app to guide you through the different rooms. Very nice expo..."
,,luck of the draw,3.0,,"The shape of the architecture of this building promises something quite spectacular, however, the form of the building is a betrayal of the contents inside. This is a museum for touring exhibitions, therefore it really is pot luck which exhibition you will be able to see when you visit, on my visit there was a National Geographic exhibit, British Museum Mummies exhibition and Charles and Ray Eames exhibition. All of these touring exhibitions were absolutely fantastic however due to the awkward shape of the architecture the main exhibition spaces were in underground galleries, making the building about a white elephant.
The permanent exhibition in the space is an interactive in which you are able to play with forms and shapes though this is a bit of a gimmick and got old in about 2 minutes.

This is an excellent museum to have though as to what you'll see is really up to whats in town at that time.

No cheap..."
,,Good for a rainy day,3.0,,I went and saw the dinosaur exhibit. The museum is of a good standard. The exhibit itself had a logical flow and was informative. Not a must see but a good thing to do on a rainy day.
,,Excellent way to spend a few hours,5.0,,"I've been to this museum on every trip to Singapore and it never fails to deliver. Upmarket, professional and high standard exhibitions. Easy to get around. Great gift shop. Amazing building. I took my grandson to the Dinosaur exhibition this time and it was as memorable as every other visit. Well done to Singapore for making such a wonderful museum."
,,Awesome collection,4.0,,"Room by room through the dinosaur exhibition I was excited and each room it got better.

The exhibition design, layout, and content were all great! I love natural history and frequent such places in every city I travel to. I learned plenty in this exhibition and the combination of drawings with the big bones etc was unique! There's also some cool hands on stuff for kids.

Highly recommend. Worth the price tag. You can spend a lot
Of time in here."
,,Modern Museum for absolutely everyone!,5.0,,"I've have only had the pleasure of being to singapore twice, and both times i have spent at least 3 hours at ArtScience. The thing i love about this museum the most is that they are constantly trying new things, and display their collections and very interesting and unique ways. The first time i went i was surprised with my two of my greatest inspirations and favorite artists, Salvador Dali and Leonardo Da Vinci. The exhibits were made so interestingly and i have never in my life seen such a vast collection of pieces. My second time i visited was during the Egyptian and Herman Miller. I learned so much about both subjects and even got to sit in the Essential Herman Miller chair!!! Hands down one of my favorite places in the world and especially singapore."
,,Amazing :),4.0,,I went to the museum last month and it has shown the journey to Dinosaur. It also exhibits the Essential Eames from Herman Miller. The furniture exhibitions wow-ed me a little but the Dinosaur tour has given me a unique experience in following the history of prehistoric times. You can interact with some of the interactive features from each historic ages. See the come-to-life dinosaurs statues and informations. Very resourceful and I might be coming back to experience new themes from ArtScience Museum!
,,Well worth a look.,5.0,,"Just went there today , done nearly everything else so thought we would go and see the Dinosaur exhibit and we weren't disappointed . It cost $24 for an adult . Kids would love it. It's on till July , give it go."
,,ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"Dear Reviewers, Can any one assist me by providing the following information:
1. What is the visiting Schedule of the Museum?
2. What is the Ticket fare of the visit?
3. I would like to visit on 10 Apr 2014 in the evening from 0600 PM to 0800 PM."
,,Dinosaurs!!!,5.0,,Went to the museum for the great Dinosaur collection 20 February. Well worth the visit. No problems with the crowds as the Lunar New Year holidays were over and were able to see the exhibits in peaceful surroundings.
,,Dinosaurs - Let Down by Rude Visitors,3.0,,"I was very much looking forward to this exhibit. Unfortunately we accidentally visited on the Monday after Chinese New Year which I later found out was a school holiday. The problem we encountered was many groups of people (many with children, some without) acting extremely rudely. I was literally shoved more than once and I saw more than one group of children climbing on the exhibits despite many signs prohibiting it.

The museum should have limited the number if people allowed in. The result of the overcrowding and rudeness was we missed a lot if the information that was presented and felt we did not get good value for money (the entrance tickets were over $20 each).

Overall I think this was probably a very good exhibition, but it was too crowded, chaotic and rude to truly enjoy it. Go, but carefully choose your day."
,,Dinosaurs: wonderful exhibition,5.0,,"The Artscience Museum's dinosaur exhibition is worth a visit! The whole set up is professional, with easy to read signs (English), beautiful skeletons (some huge ones!) and detailed 1:1 replica's. What is different from other dinosaurs exhibitions is that this one uses beautiful drawings of an artist to further enrich the experience. Using the app you can even get more information. I went there alone, but noticed that kids had a lot of fun too, as there are a lot of touch-and-do games around."
,,Dino Exhibit - worth every penny,5.0,,"We visited the museum for the Dinosaur exhibit, as our young sons love dinos ans everything related.
The exhibit was extremely well curated and we learned a lot and enjoyed every minute. Although we went on CNY day the museum was not crowded and we were able to take our time and engage with the interactive displays without feeling pushed.

I highly recommend this exhibit!"
,,One of the landmarks in Singapore,5.0,,"There are tons of things to do and see in Marina Bay area and ArtScience Museum is one, that you can't miss. Amazing architecture and changing exhibitions. I'm sure that this building and Marina Bay Sands hotel in the background you can find in every tourists photoalbum"
,,Surprisingly good!,4.0,,"We stumbled across the ArtScience museum while wandering around near the Marina Bay Sands building. This is a beautiful structure alongside the water and is very close to the Gardens by the bay (walking distance).

There were two options we could have taken; the free option which was just the top level, or the paid option (which wasn't very expensive) to see some of the feature exhibits. In this case, the Charles & Ray Eames exhibit and the Black Dress photography exhibit. I would highly recommend doing the paid exhibits. They aren't hugely expensive, and the free option is really a bit boring and some of the interactive features weren't working properly.

My husband and I spent about an hour looking through the Charles & Ray Eames exhibit and really had a really fun time! It was all interactive, you could touch and sit on a few of the displays and really take your time to enjoy what was on offer."
,,Nice exposition,5.0,,The exposition about Charles & Ray Eames was quite good. Pretty complete restrospective of their work and life.
,,Visited Eames Exhibition,5.0,,Fantastic building and saw the very inspiring Eames exhibition. Very reasonable entry price and a great location. Highly recommended.
,,Lots of fun -- especially for fans!,5.0,,"A state-of-the art facility and a marvel of architecture, the museum hosts travelling pop culture exhibitions such as The Magic of Harry Potter. A must-visit when in Singapore!"
,,very interesting,4.0,,"the museum building itself is very unique in shape.
the exhibitions are also fascinating. we saw lego sculpture exhibitions and mummy exhibitions. too bad they charge expensively for the exhibitions, and we still have to pay more for the special photograph."
,,Building stands out,5.0,,"The actual building is really interesting in a shape of a lotus. It holds different exhibitions during a year so I would recommend to visit only if there is something which interests you on display, otherwise look from the outside :)"
,,Favourite museum in Singapore,5.0,,"I've visited this museum on several occasions and every time I enjoyed it. They have one permanent exhibition and several temporary ones. I don't really like the permanent one, but the temporary ones are to my liking. I've been to see Lego Art as well as National Geographic pictures and recently we visited the exhibition on Charles and Ray Eames. All three exhibits I truly liked. I can't wait to come back to Singapore to see what exhibit they have on in this museum."
,,Beautiful building & space but current exhibitions not worth it.,1.0,,"Having watched the development of this building over the last couple of visits to Singapore, finally we had the chance to go inside. Even though the museum is beautifully designed and constructed, and the interior space a very pleasant environment to be in, the current exhibitions are incredibly boring. The ""Little Black Jacket"" series of photos would have to be the most disappointing representation of anything Chanel, and felt I could have enjoyed a walk through a Freedom or Ikea store more than the Eames exhibit. Truly a disappointing experience. Curator needs to seriously redress what's on show.
Josephine"
,,Interesting architecture filled with interesting exhibits,4.0,,"A wonderfully designed building by Moshe Safdie that houses some great exhibitions, some of which are free to view. At the time of my visit the museum was hosting Chanel's Little Black Jacket, a series of photos by Karl Lagerfeld, which was free, and Essential Eames, a study of the design methods of Charles and Ray Eames, which was presented very well and had a reasonable-for-Singapore entrance fee. I enjoyed both exhibitions. They also have a permanent interactive history of design room on the top floor which is worth visiting. A nice place to visit even if you don't go inside."
,,Interesting building and great exhibition,4.0,,"I visited the museum to see the ""50 Best National Geographic Photos"" exhibition.
I like the design of the building and its proximity to the Marina Bay Sands hotel.
The surrounding area outside the entrance is relaxing.
Inside the exhibition was well laid out and it was a nice experience.
Glad I went here."
,,Where Art and Science meet,4.0,,"I have always wondered where the fine line is between Art and science. Me and teenaged daughter, who often asked the same question, visitied this and were thrilled at what we saw. The Mummy exhibition, Nat GEo's top 50 photos and a lot of exciting stuff.. We spent a lot of time pondering over the exhibits that showed that the boundries between art and science are thin indeed..."
,,Some very impressive pieces of Lego,3.0,,"Some great Lego art work. Weird how the paintings, say Scream or Mona Lisa, looked even more realistic (and less pixelated) when viewed through a camera lens"
,,Visit the National Geographic exhibition!,4.0,,"If you have any interest in photography, then visit the exhibition of National Geographic's Top 50 photos. The photos are varied but extremely engaging, particularly thanks to the narratives from the photographers. However, the side rooms dedicated to photographic skills was an added bonus to an amateur photographer like me. I've done a couple of basic photography courses and the skills overview on elements such as composition, colour, lighting, etc was a great refresher. It turned out to be an enjoyable learning experience! I only wish the Art Science museum had more cashiers or automatic ticket machines so that the queues could be reduced."
,,great building but disappointment inside,2.0,,"In lobby there was huge queues, it was sunday afternoon, on October, but only 3 booking clerks was on duty, it takes more than 1/2 hours before we get tickets. The Mummy 3d-show didn't make impression, why they use single-use glasses; lots of miniatures in the exhibition, I must say that in Tampere in Finland we had better Mummy exhibition last year, here in far north. Natgeo- exhibit was ok, anyway it is business-oriented, it should be free of charge.
Sad to say, not worth of that money."
,,Mummy and Eames Exhibitions,4.0,,"We were there for the Mummy exhibition, but no photography was allowed, which was quite a disappointment.

The Mummy’s exhibits and artifacts were quite educational and we can learn about history behind the mummification in the ancient Egypt as well as the embalming process. Brain was taken out of the body by putting hook through the nasal passage. OUCH!

We also visited Eames exhibition where my younger kids enjoyed better, because the 3D Mummy show at the beginning of the exhibition terrorized my 4 years old. Hahaha…

The museum itself is a marvelous piece of art, located outside Marina Bay Sands (MBS). The architecture of the museum was astonishingly beautiful, it resembles a water lily (or lotus), maybe that’s why the museum is surrounded by a lily pond.

The interior of the museum was just as good. The museum has several exhibition sections located at various floors, all clean, bright and welcoming.

I feel that this museum is more suitable for teens and adults, the younger children probably might do better somewhere else, like Singapore Art Museum (SAM)."
,,Fantasic space and saw a great exhibition,5.0,,"Went to the Ray and Charles Eames exhibition, one of the best exhibitions about the design process that I have seen."
,,Great museum!,5.0,,"We visited all 3 exhibitions - Mummies, National Geographic 50 Best Photos & Eames. They were all absolutely fascinating & really enjoyed our time there.

Mummies - although the exhibition itself was not big, well presented & very educational. Each exhibits had very detailed explanation & we were able to learn lots about mummies.

NG50BP - very interesting exhibition as I remembered looking at some of the photos on the cover of National Geographic.

Eames - little slower compare to other 2 exhibitions but it was a nice interesting one to finish off the visit to the museum.

You can get a portable guide for $3 & it would help you understand more deeply about the exhibitions.

I'd love to visit again to see the different exhibition next time we visit Singapore."
,,A Great Interactive Museum,4.0,,"We enjoyed all three exhibits: Mummies, National Geographic 50 Best Photos and Eames. They were interactive. Even younger children would enjoy their visit."
,,"Great exhibition, terribly inflexible systems",4.0,,"Went to the Mummy exhibition, no problems, good show.

However, we bought tickets online. At the desk we asked if we could add on the ""National Geographic 50 best photos"" show as well, to take advantage of the combo promotion which offers the second show at 50% discount if you buy the two together to see on the same day. Answer: No - you must pay the full price for the national geographic show, you cannot add additional shows to a ticket already purchased online, instead you must pay the full price for both. Could we refund the online mummy ticket and buy the combo ticket? Answer; No - you cannot refund an online ticket even to buy a more expensive ticket.

So we didn't go the the national geographic exhibition. The lesson? If you want a combo make sure you buy it online or at the desk on the day. Don't try to upgrade your tickets or add additional shows spontaneously - the Art Science museum has no flexibility to accommodate such requests - it a forward thinking piece of architecture with rigid systems and staff with no empowerment at all."
,,Must Visit!,5.0,,"I was here for the Mummy exhibition. But I will review the ArtScience Museum. Not the Mummy exhibition.

The museum was located outside Marina Bay Sands (MBS). Go inside MBS and follow the directions. The architecture of the museum was astonishing. Very beautiful. Surrounded by gardens and huge area for hang out, taking pictures, enjoying the scene, or even jogging. Ticket box was helpful. If you book through the website, be aware that they asked us which time-slot visit we prefer. If you can manage your schedule, and during weekends or holiday seasons, I strongly recommended you book through their website. But if you visit on weekdays, then just go-show.

The interior inside was marvellous and beautiful. The museum has several exhibition sections and all located beneath the reception floor. Very clean, cool aircon, nice staffs. Apart from souvenirs store from the exhibitions, they have a regular merchandise store (which I found not that tempting).

Overall, I highly recommend this place."
,,Amazing display of the Ancient Egyptian Mummies,4.0,,"We visited this amazing Art and Science Museum at Marina Bay on 14 Oct 2014.
We arrived in the afternoon via the Bayfront yellow MRT and thankfully the museum still open.
We enter the Museum at 17.00, last admissions 18.30 and it will close at 19.00.We paid 15 SGD to enter , we skipped the National Geography 50 Best photos and the Eames exhibit, because we think there's so little time.But we managed to see few other exhibition by a Japanese artist on one of the floors.The staffs were kind and helpful.
As we entered the museum , before the 17.30 3D Mummy Theatre show , we checked out the Souvenir shop and find some cool T-shirts.
We are lucky to witness the Mummy exhibition in conjunction with the British Museum , because it will end in November 2013.Sad that taking pictures was not allowed.
The artifacts was superb, we can see things that was dated about 2000 BC, 4 Mummies , Embalming room , and history behind the mummifying process in the ancient Egypt.
The structure of the Art and Science museum ,was amazing ,resembles the flower of Lotus , sits between the pools .Stunning view can be seen in the afternoon when all lights from the city lits.
This visit was well worthed and we definitely will come back for another exhibition !"
,,Avant-Garde meets Antiquity,4.0,,"I visited the ArtScience Museum to check out two exhibitions that were being held simultaneously - Secrets of the Mummy, and National Geographic's 50 Best Photos. The former was in collaboration with the British Museum, while the latter highlighted all the iconic Nat Geo images, including the famous Afghan girl. Buying package tickets to the two exhibitions cost SGD24 per pax. If you're interested in visiting the exhibition, it would be best to check out the Museum's website to find out when the respective exhibitions end.

The Museum is contemporary in design. It is easy to access via Marina Bay MRT, and is open until 7pm (last admission 6.30pm). As per other museums, there is a souvenir shop, as well as a cafe."
,,"1 of the best, if not the best in singapore",5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit every few months as they have revolving exhibits. This time, they have the Egyptian mummy, National geographic and Eames exhibits and they were all great. You learn a ton from each of the so different exhibits, and they are fun too

And outside the museum, lots of picture perfect shots of the skyline and amazing architecture around"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Not bad and worth a visit....don't waste money on tourist photos though as the quality is average. Lovely building and outlook towards the city.
,,"Interesting, worth a look.",4.0,,Very interesting building which had very few people inside. The exibits were well presented though aimed at a more mature audience. We had the pleasure of viewing the NAT GEO photo exibit and the Eqypt mummy exibit bot were great.
,,A MUST VISIT FOR MUSEUM LOVERS,5.0,,This was my second visit to this inspiring museum. Last time I visited during December 2011 when remains of Titanic were displayed. This time around I saw the Egyptian mummies. The presentation takes to that era and leaves a permanent impression about it. A well laid out museum inside an architectural masterpiece.
,,"Excellent specialty museum, offering an array of ever changing exhibits; tip: buy tickets online",5.0,,"This is an excellent specialty museum.

Your interest in visiting will depend on the exhibitions they are running at the time.

Presently, there are three exhibitions:

1. The Mummy- a British Museum display of items from Ancient Egypt. The highlight is a mummy.

2. Ray and Charles Eames retrospective - celebrating the work of these influential industrial designers

3. National Geographic top 50 photographs

Each is an excellent exhibition- if you're interested in the subject matter!

Each exhibition is presented professionally and to a world class standard.

You get a discount if you visit all three exhibitions.

They have a museum shop where you can buy souvenirs and memorabilia.

Well worth a visit- if what's on interests you."
,,Amazing Building,4.0,,"Located in the Marina Bay Sands precinct, this unique building is shaped like a partially opened Lotus flower. Very interesting Egyptian exhibition and National Geographic photography exhibitions when we were there."
,,A place to remember,4.0,,"I was on a vacation with my wife here. This place near Marina Bay sands is the best place. It was a very learning experience and I found myself reliving my childhood. Some may find it pricey but it’s worth it especially the Mummy exhibition (which did spook my wife a bit). Since we had visited it at night, it was a feast for the eyes. Really enjoyed the 3D movie. I would say it was a really exciting and unforgettable experience one wouldn’t forget."
,,Enjoyed my time there,4.0,,"It was about 4.30pm when we got there by the Helix Bridge on a Tuesday. Not many visitors then and we bought tickets for the Mummy exhibition only, costing us SGD15 each. We went down to the basement which was laid out around the base of the central atrium that contained quite a poetic looking pool of water.

Waited until 5pm for the 3D show that starts off the Mummy exhibition. There were quite a lot of 3D-effects and it was amazing to think that by using the latest technology and scanners, the scientists / archaeologists could ""see"" and analyse the mummy and reconstruct his face, without even having to open the coffin! (that's our understanding of it, anyway). After the show, we were ushered in to see the Egyptian exhibits from the British Museum which culminated in a room containing that priest's mummy that was featured in the show.

The shop on the way out sold Egyptian-themed and novelty souvenirs, some from the British Museum. We bought colour-changing mugs and freeze-dried ""space food"" from the US which we thought were rather cool.

Went up to the top floor after that and only managed to see one room of the permanent displays before they closed at 7pm."
,,Good depending on the exhibits,3.0,,"I went here the first time and I liked it alot, it was when the Titanic exhibit was here. I found the other galleries not that exciting. This time I went again and it was alright, but the boring galleries it turned out were permanent exhibitions, and the temporary one was a lego one and the mummy one. So it was alright, so only go if you like the main exhibition that's playing, don't go to see other things cause you'll be disapointed"
,,Didn't like it....,2.0,,"I personally did not like the place. There were 3 exhibitions going on at the same time. I just passed by as I was at the shopping centre, and the building looked attractive.

I bought tickets for the Egyptian mummy exhibition and the National Geographic top 50 photos of the world.

I was with my kids, and they did not enjoy it. The exhibition seems to be more for senior people. There was a lot of reading and the exhibits were not that attractive."
,,Find Mummy,5.0,,We got the opportunity to find mummy from England at the time we visited this place.. A good place to teach children to love history/ visiting museums..
,,Mummy exhibition,4.0,,"Only visited for the current Mummy exhibition. Not a lot on display but what there is was well laid out and very informative as befits something done in conjunction with the British Museum. Definitely less is more. Reasonably priced and get a discount if you pay by AMEX. But in typical by-the-book SIngapore fashion you MUST see the film before you go into the display - no way around this apparently so don't think you can just waltz in at any time at your convenience, you are tied to the show times to start the visit."
,,Still interesting on second visit,5.0,,"This is one of the must visit places for me as I enjoy museums. It is modern and not stuffy. The exhibits are more in tune with the times in terms of presentation - simple, modern and easy to understand. I feel those who enjoy art and design will like this place.

My first visit was two years ago, for the Dali (great!) and Van Gogh (so-so) exhibitions.

There are complaints that this place is expensive - but then again, Singapore is an expensive place to visit. Senior citizens (above 65) enjoy a discounted rate. My dad is 61 but he got through. I just said one ticket for me and one senior ticket for my dad. They did not ask to see his passport. I guess he could pass off as a senior as he has white hair and wrinkles!

There are usually two to three exhibitions on at the same time. If you plan on visiting all, arrange to see all on the same day so you can buy combined tickets which are cheaper. And also look out for holidays. We went there on National Day and the Essential Eames was free. We also saw the Mummy exhibition. If you plan on joining the guided tours and activities, come on the weekends. They are also offered on public holidays.

Eames was excellent because you could actually touch and sit on many of the furniture. And take photographs freely. The videos were also interesting but I did not have time to see them all. For the Mummy, we went for the embalming workshop, which was actually geared for kids and performed on a dummy. But both my dad and I enjoyed it.

The permanent exhibition on the top floor is nothing to shop about. You can skip that.

The cafe was closed when we were there. If you want to save on food expenses, pack a bun or some biscuits and water. Otherwise, you could pop over to the food court at Marina Bay Sands (crazy crowded on weekends - it's the only 'cheap' place to eat in the vicinity). Transportation is easy as the train comes directly to Marina Bay Sands.

If you want to maximise your day here, you could do the museum in the daytime and pop over to Gardens by the Bay for the free light and sound show at night (7.45 and 8.45), held at the Supertree Grove (the giant trees).

For curiosity's sake, you could also drop by the casino at Marina Bay Sands (you need to show your passport), enjoy the free drinks and gawk at the size of the place. Go to the centre and look to the lower floor - it is like being in a big spaceship with pods of gambling tables."
,,"Interesting building, overpriced once inside",4.0,,"Visited the Museum after seeing the Mummy exhibition advertised, the building itself is amazing but I felt the exhibitions was so overpriced and these wasn't that much to see of the Mummy artifacts"
,,Nice!,4.0,,"Well organized and informative. I was there for Mummies' exhibition and Essential Eames. There are play centre for Essential Eames, however they will need to be more attentive to guests and explain to them what are they suppose to build and what are the purposes. It was fun nonetheless. =)"
,,Better from outside,3.0,,"Although the curious geometry of the building makes it intriguing from outside, the exhibition offering is quite poor for a place that aims to be an ""Arts and Science Museum"".
As other attractions in Singapur (and the rest of the city!) it is perfectly clean, modern and well maintained, the staff is absolutely kind and efficient and there are activities for children, but to be honest I still have to find the link between art and science here.
The original idea is good but IMHO it has to be developed a bit more to compare to similar museums around the world."
,,A complete waste of money and time,1.0,,"I agree with what many others have said in their reviews; the outside is nice but the inside is a waste of your money.

The museum is beautiful from the outside, and has a prime location that offers gorgeous views of the city and marina; however, entering the museum is a waste of your money and time. The first sign this was nothing more than a way to gouge consumers was when I had to pay $9 for my sleeping 2 year old to enter - I don't even pay an admission fee for her to enter the Jurong Bird Park or the aquarium on Sentosa, yet this pretentious mess charges admission for a 2 year old. The next sign was that seniors don't receive a discount until they're 65, so they charged full admission for my 61 year old mother (this is also different than most museums and attractions around the world).

After being robbed at the ticketing counter we proceeded to the Mummy exhibit. The lower floor is split into 4 areas that you could visit (a restaurant appeared off limits due to construction). Two of the 4 areas were entirely devoted to the museum's greed - gift shops. Another area was a small theater that showed a ""3D"" movie on mummies (it was just OK), and the final area was the actual mummy exhibit.

The mummy exhibit wasn't bad, but I've visited the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and this paltry display was a letdown, particularly given the absurd pricing for admission.

The top floor of the museum, which I assume is their ""permanent"" exhibit, is a complete joke. One room with a looped video (way too loud), and another room with what I guess these crooks consider the science portion of the museum - a brief description of a buckey ball...

Avoid this museum unless you enjoy throwing your money away. Take photos of the outside, enjoy to lovely lotus blooms in the surrounding pools, and even step inside for a little air conditioning, but don't bother paying to enter."
,,Really good show,4.0,,"We visited the museum and took in the Mummy exhibition and show. Our six year old, along with us, thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I can imagine some really spectacular exhibits here.

We looked around the shop - not as overpriced as you would think. The assistants took time to engage with our son too show him various things and he had lots of questions for them.

The 3D Mummy show was really interesting and the interactive exhibits with a factfind for my boy was well done.

I would love to go here again for another exhibition."
,,Building beats exhibit,3.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is a transformed and very modern area of Singapore. The Museum is a stunning addition to the area's landscape. When I went there were two main exhibits--a mummy exhibit from the British Museum, and the permanent collection On the first, no question--the British ripped off everything of quality from Egypt. There was a mummy case and coffin in seemingly 'perfect' shape, dozens of artful and well-preserved funeral items, great information on mumification, etc. There was also a captivating 3-D exploration of the mummy's insides by electric imaging.

On the other hand the permanent collection was quite shallow--the key question seemed to be 'what kinds of great discoveries combine art and science?' and the answer seemed to be 'lots' but that was about it. A few shots of hot air balloons from early China to potential for use on Mars; diVinci and flight plus the Wright brothers and Chinese astronauts--but basically a lot of 'show and tell' without much coherence or added insight."
,,mixed feelings,4.0,,"I feel that he best feature of this museum is how it looks when lit up at night (which is not how it should be remembered).
We were lucky that the 2 exhibits when we went were very interesting to us - the mummification & the eames. This made the price of admission worth it because they were both very good - otherwise I honestly didn't see anything much of interest.
There was a coffee shop - but it wasn't open."
,,Impressive,4.0,,"Whilst viewing Marina Bay, entice to visit and explore this gorgeous Lotus shaped building. Experience Mummy exhibition. Worth a visit while there, don't miss it"
,,"Few but interesting exhibits, 3D movie great but scary",3.0,,"The exhibits main attraction is a replica of the Rosetta Stone and a 3D movie. The 3D movie (about 25 minutes) more visually impressive than most museums 3D movies. However, the narrators description of mummification, particularly the removal of the brain via a sharp instrument inserted into the nose, was too much for my 7-yr old and I had to leave with him. The museum is located next an upscale mall and a riverside which contains some nice bars and restaurants. One final tip: entrance fee is reduced for Singapore residents so expats should show their FIN cards so as not to be confused with tourists."
,,An interesting Egyptian mummy display,3.0,,"The name of the museum implies art and science’. There were two levels of displays on art themes and an exhibition on ‘Mummy-Secrets of the Tomb. This runs until 4 November 2013. It showed the Egyptian burial practices and mummification process. The education packs available for children to investigate looked really good and the children around us seemed to be really getting into it. A word of warning though. The 3D film was excellent and very informative, but I would not advise parents to take young children into viewing the film. A couple of mothers took young children out of the film. The exhibition after the film was very good and well labelled. The Charles and Ray Eames exhibition on furniture design was interesting. For a cost of $24 it was reasonable. There was a refreshment area but it was not open at 10am and there was no sign of activity even later on. A bit disappointing."
,,educational and a nice break from the heat and rain,5.0,,First of all the architecture and design of the Museum is spectacular. It's awesome to look at from the outside and inside. The special exhibitions at the museum are definitely worth seeing. I've been twice before and saw the Titanic and Lego exhibit which were both amazing.The museum is professionally curated which is a nice change from the museums in Vietnam. Since it's located in Marina Bay area - it's a perfect add on to other activities like the Botanic Gardens - maybe worth visiting after the gardens for a break in cool air conditioning!
,,A bit too bare but still good fun,4.0,,"It was very good to look at, but in general there were too little things to see. And the interactive postcard machines don't work!"
,,This place rocks,5.0,,"It was a wet day. What to do? Go see the Mummy exhibition. Well done, with activity packs for the kids based on their age. Sometimes these things can be a bit overwhelming - a la the entire British Museum - but this was a great slice of one mummy's life. Well done. Gorgeous building too - even though it had a leak or two due to the volume of rain!"
,,Very Cool,5.0,,Visited the Mummy exhibit and was blown away. Reasonably priced and the exhibits are quite fascinating. The 3D movie to start the exhibit gave a fascinating account of mummies and the practice of mummification by ancient Egyptians.
,,"Art, Science and Design",4.0,,"We had wanted to visit this museum ever since we saw the building from a distance; it looks a little like an up-turned hand. Our approach to the building was fabulous; we walked from the Singapore Flyer along the water front and across the fabulous Helix bridge (walkway only), I think the bridge by itself would have been enough for the science fans I was with. The museum was featuring the Mummy exhibition from the British Museum so our timing to visit was excellent. The exhibition was very good and well laid out, but hampered by the sheer numbers of people who were viewing at the same time. We basically had to queue to look at each exhibit. The rest of the museum seemed a little empty. There were a couple of displays on different floors, but we were left wondering what there would have been to look at if the Mummy exhibition hadn't been on. The design of the buliding is really exciting, especially from the outside, but we were disappointed that there were no windows, or areas where the shape of the building would have been more evident."
,,Lots of fun for the kids,4.0,,"This was a great day out and a contrast to the other days spent at fun parks, and the kids had a great time all the same. There were a couple of exhibitions and lots of hands on activities. The family made face masks and amulets and learnt about ancient Egypt and mid 20th century design. Very eclectic, but even the five year old had a great day.

Well worth a visit!"
,,ArtScienece Museum at Marina Bay Sands,3.0,,"The Museum is actually located in the unique lotus shape architecture, just next to shopping mall. You will first pass by the beautiful pool of Lotus.

The time we visit have the exhibitions on the Lego Brick artwork exhibitions, open lot of imagination for kid. Worth a visit if you have time for a hour or more."
,,Beautiful Architecture and Museum!,4.0,,Saw the June exhibit: Mummy Secrets of the Tomb in 3-D and it was terrific. The exhibit that accompanies the movie is beautifully displayed and very interesting.
,,British Museum Egyptian artifacts made the visit worthwhile,3.0,,The museum buidling is interesting in itself. It's a pleasant walk over the Helix Bridge. There don't seem to be many things to see apart from a couple of audio-visual displays. What made the visit worthwhile was the travelling exhibition from the British Museum on Ancient Egypt. The 3D presentation of a forensic investigation of a sarcophagus (which you can see there) was particularly good.
,,A memorable visit - ArtScience Museum is truly international,4.0,,"I had my visit to ArtScience Museum when they were exhibiting the Harry Potter artifacts and clothes. I must admit the experience was truly unique, and one that is unforgettable, except for the fact that this memory cannot be retained for long-term storage as photography was strictly forbidden. While the rationale of this rule still remains unclear to me, as I clearly do not see why photography without flash cannot be done as these are just artifacts and clothes, not paintings. I must admit that I really wish I could visit the Harry Potter museum again as an avid fan of Harry Potter books and films, plus the display was very memorable and interesting to see. Moreover, I think the souvenirs are overpriced, which is another disappointment. But, what was fortunate was we managed to get free tickets to Andy Warhol museum for buying tickets to Harry Potter one.

I sincerely do hope that ArtScience Museum can be flexible enough to allow at least photography without flash so as to satisfy fans-of-the-theme-displayed, to give them a long lasting memory as a 'gift of a life-long time', as I do believe these museums do not repeat themselves in the future."
,,One of a kind museum!!!,5.0,,"Good:
-My first time there, it was the TITANIC exhibition & it blew my mind off! It was a world class display worth every cent of my time!!!
-My second visit was for the MUMMY, which was good because it was brought in from another museum...but to be honest...it was over-rated & not worth the visit.
-Impressed the curators always keep on bringing in exhibits that not only interest me, but are CAPTIVATING & make for good phototaking opportunities.

Bad:
-I find $14 for a child ticket expensive.
-Carpark is expensive.
-Though the expensive entrance ticket, it is worth visiting it because of the unique exhibition it has.

,,I love mummy,5.0,,It was my lucky day to have this rare opportunity that the Art science Museum exhibits The Mummy: Secrets of the Tomb. Since long that I wanted to see with my own eyes this kind of exhibition. They have the real mummies inside and many articles were also exhibited. I love mummy !
,,Inspired to be creative?,5.0,,"We went there when the Lego exhibit by Nathan Sawaya was in town. (A few months back, we were there for the Andy Warhol exhibit). What an amazing collection! It renewed my love for Lego blocks! My son's love for Lego blocks was re-ignited! We both became reminiscent of his Lego days as a child. The ArtScience Museum is definitely a place to be inspired creatively!"
,,Great for families,3.0,,"Managed to see both the ""art of the brick"" and the Egyptian exhibitions. Both great for visiting, only negative thing was there were lots of local school children in the Egyptian exhibition, which made seeing so exhibits pretty hard"
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"We were lucky enough that we got to see The Art of The Brick here excellent ,but air conditioning is freezing"
,,An afternoon of Bricks & Mummies,4.0,,"I have been always fascinated by the lovely lotus shaped structure of the Arts Science Museum, it stands out, though I have been to Marina Bay Sands numerous times, this round I decided to visit the museum as there are 2 exhibits on.

I bought the $24 2 -in-1 package which allows me to visit 2 exhibits, the Mummy: Secrets of the Tomb & The Art of the Brick.

I first visited the Mummy exhibit which begins with a 3D video explaining ancient Egypt and how mummies are embalmed, complete with a pair of 3D glasses which you can take home as a souvenir. After the video presentation, you can walk out to a very complete & organized exhibit on ancient Egypt complete with a few actual mummies.

After finishing my walk, I took the elevator up to the Brick exhibit which shows the work of Nathan Sawaya. I would have to say it was amazing to be able to see the things which can be made with Lego bricks, I spent sometime there admiring the detailed complexity of the creations and took a lot of photos.

All in all I would have to say that the Arts Science Museum is well kept, clean, organized and staff very efficient and friendly. Cant complain about the entrance fee as $12 per exhibit I think is a fair deal.

I would gladly come back in the future for other exhibitions. Thumbs up!"
,,Mummy at the Museum,5.0,,"My wife and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands and we only had to walk through the underground walkways and through the shops to get to the Museum, aircon all the way. The Museum is an excellent building, surrounded by ponds and on the bay side. It is clean and tidy and the staff are courteous and helpful. We saw the 'Egyptian Mummy Exhibit' and it was well presented and easy to walk through. Well worth a visit, the building itself is a masterpiece and great just to walk through and look at."
,,Mummies and Legos in a Lotus,4.0,,"The ArtScience Museum is not really a museum, I think, but more of a high-tech exhibition building where you can enjoy some fascinating displays. Our group visited the Egyptian mummy exhibition and the Lego exhibition upstairs. From the moment you enter the premises, you get a sense of the place being well organized and careful thought given to ample space being given for visitors to appreciate each exhibit.

The building itself has a spectacular design in the shape of a lotus. The entrance area features a lovely lotus pond. And the setting beside the bay is just simply fabulous. The area offers a great view of Marina Bay Sands and the vicinity. The museum is connected to a mall where there are plentiful restaurants and shops.

The mummy exhibition featured a movie that you are compelled to see before the rest of the exhibition. I thought this was too restrictive but it was a great time to nap after a lot of walking outside! The displays themselves are interesting, but the exhibits are understandably not as extensive as some others around the world. I understand this, though, as it was not a permanent display and was of a lesser figure in Egyptian history, not a pharoah.

I liked the interactive nature of the Lego exhibition more. The work that went into the construction of each display was phenomenal. The creativity in putting one together was just mind-blowing and worthy of a place at the museum.

ArtScience Museum is the kind of place that needs really fascinating exhibitions to do justice to the place. Check the exhibition program beforehand."
,,harry potter exhibition,5.0,,"Wow, it sounds great. What did you like about it? The ""Harry Potter exhibition"" everything from original costumes to the list of ""Dumbledores Army"" although the exhibition is over"
,,Lego Artwork and Egyptian Display,4.0,,"Lego display was worth a look, true artwork and Ancient Egyptian was also.
Albeit that the officious staff would not allow me to enter the exhibition without watching the 3D film beforehand which resulted in me waitig for 20 minutes for it to start. These so called ""rules"" that the new residents of Singapore enforce spoils the experience of Singapore."
,,overexpected,3.0,,There was Mummy exhibition when I was there and I joined. The exhibition was fine. Then I go to upper level to the gallery. I wished I could see many things displayed. But I was overexpected. Nothing displayed on the 3rd floor except the building history thing.
,,Cool...,4.0,,"We saw the first day of the new Mummy exhibition. Very interesting movie, and good story told through the exhibition. Kids quest a bit of a muddle. Instructions and space need to be clearer. Embalming lesson was good fun!

Lego art exhibition was amazing - soooo cool! More focused on adults than kids...

The building itself is really interesting, though from the inside, its shape and light are lost."
,,Very inspirational!,5.0,,"This is a great little museum. I saw the ""lego"" exhibition and was most impressed. Another gallery had some interactive screens which I'm sure are popular with children. All in all it was a good place to consider art, science and creativity."
,,Just too expensive,4.0,,Went there and they had the cheek to charge same admission fee even although half was closed to set up some private function.owned by marina sands so it explains a lot.Children wanted to see lego exhibition so submitted to being ripped off. Felt ripped off too.
,,Lego exhibition,5.0,,"Billed by CNN as one of the top ten exhibitions in the world, this had a lot to live up to! The displays are very impressive and it is amazing what you can create with a little plastic brick! Well worth a visit."
,,"Overpriced, underwhelming",2.0,,"Very interesting building itself but really disappointing contents. Virtually nothing in it apart from the visiting display (lego art). 4 stories, only the top floor had anything in apart from floor for visiting exhibition. I tried 2 of the interactive exhibits, neither of them worked properly. Lego art was clever, granted, but not worth the price or trip over there. Go to domes in the park next door instead."
,,Great museum!!!,4.0,,"I was here during the Harry Potter Exhibition last year with my sisters. It was a great experience and I really enjoy the museum. Overall, this is a great place to visit (if you like museum, that is)"
,,An amazing facility,5.0,,"This lotus shaped museum is an attraction just for the building. Each petal,is a gallery and it is an amazing sight from the outside and surprisingly functionally in the inside. The highlight of the Tripp was the Titanic exhibit. It is the best we have seen anywhere in the world. You become a passenger with a boarding card and a name. At the end of the visit you plan find out, from a board if your passenger survived or not. The trip takes you thru the ship and you end on the ocean floor with the ship beside you. So very well done."
,,Loved it!!,5.0,,Me and my boyfriend visited the Art of brick exhibition and we loved it its great for kids of all ages and it was all laid out in a great way so every door you go through its a whole new idea and we got the photos at the start which we're very funny. The souvenir shop was over priced but we expected that. It would be fantastic for small children and family's. we will definitely visit the next exhibit.
,,Great place for kids :),5.0,,"My kids and I visited the Art of the Brick exhibition and I was blown away by the sculptures and interactive areas for children. Usually my kids (aged 7 and 5) get bored & restless at museums but they managed to stay entertained throughout since there were many hands-on activities.

At the entrance they were given an activity box & some colorful cards that immediately caught their attention. The staff at the entrance were very helpful to my little ones and helped them thoroughly with the activity box. The colorful cards had a zoomed image of a sculpture for the kids to find. When my kids found the sculptures, the staff gave them more cards to find! It was wonderful as my kids were very vigilant to the different sculptures.

However, we paid SGD5 for a photo machine that was quite cumbersome to use & was nothing special. We asked for a refund but wasn't given one.

At the last gallery, there are some boxes of Lego for kids to play. Once again, the staff was very helpful and loving towards my kids and sat with them throughout the time we were there. My kids really enjoyed their company, and so did I.

Overall, a mind-blowing exhibition with excellent staff who go the extra mile!"
,,Building is beautiful! Don't bother going in,2.0,,"I guess I am spoiled because the silence museum in Los Angeles Is fabulous. My expectations were too high. The Lego display was great loved it but that was it. Nothing much else to see. Took about 30 minutes,"
,,"Lotus shaped building at Marina Bay, good 'Art of the Brick Lego' exhibition",3.0,,"The ArtScience Museum is the lotus shaped building next to the Marina Bay Sands (MBS) hotel. It is a unique building design that is easy to distinguish from others. Not sure if we like the shape of this building or not but it seems to work being next to the equally interestingly shaped MBS hotel.

We recently visited the ArtSpace Museum for the Art of the Brick Lego Exhibition (SG$15 per adult, SG$9 per child) and quite enjoyed the 52 lego based sculptures from artist, Nathan Sawaya on display.

Sculptures are well placed in 5-6 rooms and lighting is good in most rooms for picture taking. We most enjoyed the feature pieces in the beginning of the exhibition - 'Yellow' with the lego man sort of pulling his chest open. The Swimmer and the giant Red Face were also very nice. The rest of the rooms provide mostly smaller sculptures as well some information about the artist and what inspired him to continue with his passion of building and creating things out of legos.

There is a play area for children towards the end with open boxes of legos set up on tables. Video demonstrations as well of how Lego movies are made with iPone applications and a small gift shop area wrap up your visit to the ArtScience Museum for the Art of the Brick exhibition.

Overall, this was a fun way to spend some time. You only need 20-30 minutes to go through the entire exhibition but can spend longer if you are enjoying what you see. We were there for approximately 45 minutes. This does make the exhibition a bit pricey but if you like Legos why not.

Exhibition seems to be finished by 27 April 2013. There will be an interesting new exhibition starting soon featuring mummies and other Egyptian exhibits in conjunction with the British Museum. This might be worth checking out for those visiting Singapore later this spring."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"A must see museum if you're in Singapore! They have different exhibitions on certain months so it's wise to check with the company's website for the latest exhibits. The Titanic artifacts, the Harry Potter, Dali were shown here! The entrance fees were just OK (except for Harry Potter) and the staffs are friendly and helpful."
,,amazing!,5.0,,The Art Science Museum is truly amazing! They have a new exhibition almost everyday! I enjoyed going to the Titanic and Harry Potter exhibitions the most.
,,Great Exhibit!,5.0,,"We took our girls to the Lego Exhibit and they were amazed! To be honest, I was amazed, since I spent much of my youth playing with Legos! We spent a couple of hours and it was well worth it!"
,,Very Friendly And Helpful Staff,5.0,,Beautiful museum and interesting exhibition; The Art of The Brick. Love your friendly and helpful staff. I lost my wallet while exploring the galleries and told the staff wearing black polo tee about my situation. And after 5 minutes they found it. Thank you so much for a pleasant day. Cheers!
,,Art of brick,4.0,,"Once we noticed the building, we decided to know what it is exactly. It is a wonderful design museum for the form of the Lotus flower and representing a welcoming hand with its 10 fingers which conisit of galleries and sustainable lighting. The center point of the building showing a nice fountain/waterfall, which collect the rain water and recycle it to use it for the restrooms.
We attended the Art of Brick Gallery. It was such a great gallery showing the adequate jobs made by different bricks' artists.
The Museum is located in an excellent location opposite to the Marina Bay Sands mall, hotel, Theater and the Merlion."
,,"Expected more, but very good",4.0,,"Located in the amazing looking building outside Marina Bay Sands I visited when there was an exhibition by a Lego sculptor. The exhibition itself was very well presented in multiple rooms and with smoke, music and lighting all adding to the atmosphere. I did think there might be other exhibitions in the building too, but there is a shop in the basement, and on the top floor an interesting selection of art-science sculptures (eg Leonardo Di Vinci's flying machine) and an interesting and well presented film about how art and science combine. Enjoyed my visit immensely."
,,Must do in SG,5.0,,"Apart from the displays on show (Magnum Photos and LEGO Man) the design of the building alone is the worth the trip. Its huge and like nothing else i have ever seen. staff were great, toilets were super super clean. well worth the visit"
,,Interactive and well collaboration btw Art & Science,4.0,,"It is a unique and beautiful building in the city. Besides those interesting theme exhibitions with full of interactive activities, there is also a permanent exhibition hall introduces the design of this building. There is also an awesome video summaries the art & science ideas from west & east culture."
,,The Art of the Brick Exhibit,4.0,,"Went to see the Lego ""The Art of the Brick"" exhibit. Fantastic. The Art Science Museum located next to Marina Bay Sands Shoppes normally has interesting exhibits that changes regularly... such as Harry Potter, Titanic, etc."
,,Unique building,5.0,,"We visited the Lego stone Art of the brick exhibition - excellent and astonishing.
A great experience in a unique building, we saw the building the night before illuminated
from the top of the Singapore flyer, fits perfectly into the new Marina lay-out."
,,Worth a trip,4.0,,"My family (3 boys age 12-15) and my friend's family (boys and girls age 9-13) really enjoyed this museum. The struture of the museum itself was really cool. The Art of the Bricks exhibit was fascinating to all of us. The size of the museum was just right; not overwhelming but good for an afternoon or morning.We spent 2 1/2 hours at there in total, and it was engaging for everybody. I strongly recommend it. Save your money by not buying the audio tour guides though - they are not worth it."
,,excellent location,5.0,,Rare exhibition using LEGO. ® bricks as sole medium by. Nathan Sawaya on display for the first time in South East Asia. Great way to encourage creative thinking here in Singapore. Connected to the main mall.
,,The Art of the Bricks: Awesome!,4.0,,"ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands is the place to exhibit seasonal exhibition. This review is dedicated for the recent exhibition of ""Art of the Bricks"" which will run through 14 April 2013
Ticketing: I purchased a combo ticket which entitle me for Sands Skypark (separate review) and all access to ArtScience museums which consist of 3 current exhibitions: Art of the Bricks, Outside In photo exhibition, and Fujians: The Blue Ocean Legacy. The bundle price for all three is SGD38 which artscience portion of the ticket costs SGD23.
Access: Artscience Museum is accessible from The Shoppes at Marina Bay portion of the complex or easily accessible from double helix bridge.
Reception area: As I had purchased my tickets at Sands Skypark ticketing, prior to entering the lobby, I proceed directly to the entrance turnstiles. Those who are interested to rent an audio guide (ipod preloaded with information for 2 exhibits: Art of the Bricks and Fujian) can get one from audio guide booth for SGD6. After the turnstile, visitors can access the elevators which bring them to different level. The Art of the bricks is located on level 2.
Exhibits: the whole exhibition is divided into several section or rooms, each with each own theme/commonality. First is the four exhibits of figures made in four major lego colour: yellow, blue, red, and green. Each represents a symbol of a character. For those without audio guide, it would feel like just a quick walk-through, but having an audio guide with me, it enables me to spend more time to understand each exhibit and the message behind it.
As the visitors progress through each room, they are presented with various figures and shapes. It just not limited to human figures, but also portraits, architectural buildings, and other objects. The most notable one is probably the huge t-rex figure made of lego and it was shown in a dedicated room. Two of the themed room is the one dubbed ""Catwalk"" where it was decorated with lots of spotlights and strobes to resemble a catwalk at a fashion show and the dark room which comes with mists and fog machines. Very cool.
Activity center and gift shop: the exhibit ends at the gift shop and some activity center. It stocked well selection of souvenirs specific to the exhibits, apparels, as well as some lego products.
Staff: staff at the exhibits could not be more annoying. There are basically two type of staff: general crew (operation) and security. The latter was patrolling around the exhibits without causing any disturbance and to ensure that visitors not touching the exhibits. The former are too much in number and since there's not much visitors during my visit, they tend to gather around at the entrance of the hall and having serious chat. This would proved bad since the exhibition hall is designed so that even slightest sound is echoed throughout. I couldn't stop hearing their voice until i proceed to the next room - all happened as I plugged an earphone to hear the audio guide.
Verdict: nice exhibits and basically stunning, a must visit and the best in comparison with other exhibition at ArtScience Museum. However, staff professionalism is questionable."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Love the Titanic Exhibition, not only was it insightful but very informative as well. Simulating sights and sounds. Memorabilia and replicas is just amazing."
,,Exhibition for all ages,5.0,,"We spent the last day of our vacation at ""The Art of the Brick"" and enjoyed very much. Could have stayed for much longer and create our own art :)
Very impressive venue in itself."
,,It Lives Up to Its Name,4.0,,"Singapore's ArtScience Museum, with its lotus blossom motif, designed by world renowned architect Moshe Safdie (the National Gallery of Canada) holds its own architecturally standing beside the soaring Marina Bay Sands.
It houses 3 permanent galleries -- Curiosity, Inspiration, Expression -- and interesting, ever-changing touring exhibitions. Purchase a combination ticket and see them all.
The museum is thoughtfully laid out so that you never feel claustrophobic even though there is so much to see.
If you are visiting Singapore, you might check online to see what exhibits will be on display during your vacation. However, regardless of what's showing, the museum (far too stuffy a word for such an up-lifing building) is worth a visit simply for its energizing, feel-good architecture all on its own.
The food choices in the meagre cafeteria are rather disappointing; however, that is not the point of a visit to the ArtScience Museum anyway.
You will walk away truly appreciating how it blends art and science in a very positive, life-affirming manner. And I'm sure you will return on you next visit. I did!"
,,Impressive building with interesting art,5.0,,We had the opportunity to see The art of the Brick (Lego) Exhibition by Nathan Sawaya. $15.00 was well worth the entry fee. Amazing pieces of art. The building itself was impressive.
,,Artsy,4.0,,"I dont really understand much about art, but surely looking at this building will peek your intrest to enter the building further"
,,Kids toys they are not!,5.0,,"""The Art of the Brick"" exhibition at the Artscience museum is a must for everyone who enjoys visual stimulation and intellectual massaging. The displays are challenging, interesting and rewarding; humorous at points, challenging at others and astonishing in terms of scale. ""Peaces"" was especially strikingLocated in a wonderful gallery, which is light, spacious and architecturally spectacular. A visit is thoroughly recommended. I was enthralled by this exhibition and was perhaps too tired to fully appreciate the Fujians exhibition on the basement level. Take advantage of the discounted rates for going to the top of the hotel, coupled with the galleries to reduce costs."
,,Lotus flower spectacular design for ArtScience Museum,5.0,,"Along the Marina Bay waterfront I explored this stunning building in which I discovered 2 great exhibitions at that time : The Art of the Brick and much more interesting for me The Fujians : The Blue Ocean Legacy. I did enjoy my time there and was impressed by the unique design of this museum. The construction reminds the "" lotus flower "" featuring an opening hand with 10 fingers each of them revealing galleries and exhibitions. In the evening the laser shows at Marina Bay illuminate colorful this place. This museum is for sure a new unforgettable creation in Singapore, the city deserves the best."
,,Visited the Art of the Brick exhibition at ArtScience Museum,4.0,,"Generally a good ambiance. I really liked how the place was designed. Exterior, with the artificial ponds/fountains were very nicely done."
,,Stunning Building,4.0,,Unfortunately you can't gain access without paying to see an exhibition. We saw 'Art of the Brick' which was amazing and well worth the money and this enabled us to explore the unique design of this building.
,,Calling all Lego fans!!Lego exhibit was good!!,4.0,,Though in terms of no. of exhibits was not many but those on display was really nice and amazing!! The creator was simply brilliant!!
,,THE BRICKS EXHIBITION IS AMAZING,5.0,,"loved loved the brick exhibition... the museum is strategically located, very modern, artistic. Pay attention to different kinds of exhibitions they have. I visited this place for a few times and visited different exhibitions. You can get ticket for only one exhibitions or get discounts if you buy a package of more than one. I think all of the exhibitions are carefully built and seriously designed! so it will be worth it, the only question is what is your art preference. I visited the Fujian exhibition, it was also awesome in terms of the design, attention to details, facilities and all. But as I'm not a big fan of boats (which was the main storyline of the exhibition, this particular one did not stand out that much for me""."
,,Lego,5.0,,"The Lego exhibition is incredible and well worth a visit. Each piece has been carefully planned and constructed, with different themes, inspirations and reactions from visitors."
,,The Welcoming Hands,4.0,,"Getting There: Take Bus 133 from Bugis, 106 from Dhoby Ghaut, 97 from Suntec city. Get to Bayfront MRT station, circle line either from Promenade or Marina Bay Mrt stations. Once you exit out of mrt, you can walk all the way straight, turn left, take one level up via escalator, keep to your right and after the Sands theatres, take escalator up to level 1 to museum. Else exit out to event plaza and follow all the way to the museum.
What to Wear? Wear comfortable shoes mainly. You have to walk long to reach the museum. Its marble flooring inside the shopping mall right from Mrt and hard tiles on the exterior.
What to Take? You can take your own water bottle or food items (light).
Price: tickets are sold for adults, children and senior citizen. If you hold UOB atms, you get some discounts.
Show: Currently there is LEGO show and Fujian province exhibits going on.
How to Choose?: You can choose the exhibits you want to visit. It’s not mandatory to buy tickets for all the exhibits present.
About the Museum: The original design was by Mosh Safde. The exterior raised finger like structures, represents lotus petals, symbolizing welcoming gesture.
Inside the Building:
Level 4: Screenings, paintings and design concept of how the Arts and science museum took place. It’s quite informative and interesting with no entry fees for it. It’s free.
Level 3: Usually an exhibit hall, currently don’t know which of the 2 exhibits is placed there.
Basement 2: Another hall for an exhibit.
Basement 1: Souvenir shop from MBS, displaying items and collection of past exhibits, museum collections and some memorabilia’s.
Pros: Aesthetic appeal, good presentation and innovative concept of displaying exhibits. Good for photography, especially lily ponds outside the museum, offers you great pictures, and recently added color fishes look very attractive.
Cons: Prices for souvenir are ridiculously expensive. (E.g. - A magic wand from Harry potter exhibit was costing 20 $ ++). Understood that Souvenir collection by the Exhibitors is priced by their management.
Verdict: It’s a place for enthusiasts for different flavors that life can offer. Not a must see place, if you have time, give it a shot."
,,"Poor value, unremarkable exhibits",2.0,,"A profit-generating machine. The exhibits are unremarkable - some good photos in the current exhibition - but otherwise a very limited sort of museum with heavy reliance on pictures, text, and other easily obtained content. Very, very expensive for what it is. Contained in an interesting building, but little else in its favour."
,,Nice Lego exposition,4.0,,"The architecture of this place is really something. We went to 2 expositions. Art with Lego, which was ver nice and a photography one wich was dissappointing for the price. Dont enter to that one its not worth it"
,,The Art of the Brick....Lego exhibit,5.0,,"We visited the Art of the Brick exhibit in January, 2013. This was not our first visit to the Museum (my wife and kids visited the Harry Potter exhibit a few months earlier). The museum is reasonably priced (as far as Singapore goes) and the exhibit was amazing. I'd highly recommend checking out the ""Art of the Brick"" if your kids enjoy Legos - and check out other exhibits at this great venue."
,,Architecture is interesting...,3.0,,"The architecture of this building is quite interesting, but that is about it. I found the museum small and the exhibitions too limited. Singapore is still really far from having museums like even the smallest ones in Europe. Besides, why is it called ""ArtScience"" museum? There is nothing scientific about its exhibitions."
,,The Art of the Brick Exhibition is Great!,4.0,,We were staying at the Marina Bay Sands just after the New Year and was lucky to find this exhibition about Lego blocks! I grew up playing with Legos! A must see for all ages!
,,Interesting Information and cool stuff,4.0,,"The museum is cool, just by looking at it, the displays are very well set out, it is easy to spend 4 hours walking around and play with the interactive stations."
,,I love the Brick!,4.0,,wonderful lego exhibits! and you can take a photo of you and convert it into lego forms. it was fun!
,,The Art of Brick highly recommended,5.0,,"Took my kids to The Art of Brick (lego artist exhibition) without knowing how long we would stay, or if it would really be worth the entry price (about S$14 adult). Turned out to be really good, kids loved it and me too. Quite amazing."
,,Well done!,5.0,,"This is one place I would give 10 stars to if I could, I think because I left feeling so uplifted! My 8-year old loved it as well; after 2 hours we finally had enough. I thought it was so well done. We really enjoyed ourselves. We saw three exhibits (Nathan Sawaya's Lego sculptures have to be seen to be believed).
The building is beautiful from the inside and the outside. It was clean, it was well staffed, well organized, it was never noisy but peaceful. There's a nice little cafe with pastries and several museum stores. I thought the exhibits were interesting and educational so that we left feeling like we'd learned a lot and were inspired.
I thought the price was right and the layout was guest-friendly. We'd been at the mall skating on the plastic rink for an hour. When we left, we walked right over to the museum not knowing what exactly was in that building that looks like ""a dragon's claw""! What a treat."
,,Brilliant use of space and light,5.0,,"We went to the Lotus expecting the Lego display to be mainly for our son's enjoyment, but it was a revelation for all of us. The artist is so talented and insightful and the art was displayed using space and light in such an effective and emotive way. May never look at a simple lego brick the same way again. Very enjoyable and well worth a look for kids and adults alike. As for the ArtScience Museum itself - a thing of beauty that we enjoyed every evening in all its colourful glory from our hotel room. Even better as a backdrop to the New Year's Eve Fireworks."
,,"""Art of Brick"" surpassed my expectations and some",5.0,,"From visiting Legoland and Art of Brick within a week, i have to say that the ""Art of the Brick"" Exhibition at Art Science Museum was very impressive, interactive, poetic and surpassed all my expectations. Highly recommended!"
,,The Art of the Brick,4.0,,Kids and I visited the Art of the Brick exhibition and enjoyed seeing how all Nathan Sawaya merged lego bricks with fine art.
,,Wish I liked it more....,2.0,,"I really wanted to love the ArtScience museum, but found it really disappointing. The photo exhibit on the ground floor was very nice, but not what I would hope for in a museum for science as well as art. The Lego exhibit would probably have been interesting, but it was not open yet. And the upper floor had the most substance with regards to art and science but was pretty limited, only containing an interactive computer display and a movie without much detail. The examples of ArtScience were pretty limited as well. Leonardo daVinci is great, but what about current artists working on that border? A fantastic concept, that just hasn't been developed enough yet to be successful. I hope they keep working to improve it!"
,,The Art of the Brick,5.0,,"I went to see Nathan Sawaya's ""The Art of Brick"" exhibition with my son. Both of us are Lego enthusiast and were awed with the Nathan's Lego bricks sculptures. The exhibition shows 52 of Nathan's work. Books and collectible are also for sale."
,,Interesting archiecture...,4.0,,"... in a stunning setting. I went for the ""Outside In"" exhibition by the Magnum Photo Agency, which included powerful B&W images of Tokyo by Jacob Aue Sobol. This is not a large museum, but is definitely worth a look. Individual exhibitions are priced separately."
,,A place for those who are interested in Art and Science,4.0,,It is worth going for those who are interested in Art and Science. The place is not very big. You will probably need 2 hours to visit all the exhibitions. Price varies based on the number of exhibitions you want to visit.
,,Dali & Titanic under one roof,5.0,,"After seeing Dali in figueres and Tampa i was very pleased to see such a great collection of his artwork in Singapore (photography allowed),with special price to see 2 exhibits the titanic captured the imagination and the heart ,specially the boarding pass on entry,which you used to check if you had survived."
,,Harry Potter Exihibition!,4.0,,"Amazing displays of artifacts and props from the movie Harry Potter! Well planned and lots to see and hands on. From the different kind of wands, costumes and even spell books to the jerseys and monsters you see in the movie. Awesome! Pity that the stuff on sale (Eg: The wands) are too expensive!!"
,,The exterior is the most fascinating part,3.0,,"The ArtScience Museum is a very cool part of the Marina Bay Sands resort. The Moshe Safdie lotus flower exterior has made this one of the most photographed attractions in Singapore. Being a new development as part of a resort, don’t expect a deep collection here. If you are hoping to learn about the rich history of Singapore, you might want to look elsewhere. Rather, enjoy one of the big touring exhibits that you’ll recognize from everywhere else in the world if you are a regular museum goer. This attraction is worth a look if you’re at the Marina Bay Sands and not into gambling, but a proper museum like the National Museum of Singapore would be a better bet if you’re looking for a real Singaporean sense of place."
,,Nothing artsy or scientific here,3.0,,"When we visited, there was only a Cartier, the watchmaker, exhibit on offer. Nothing else available in the whole building! While the watch exhibit was alright, it alone did not warrant the admission fee and the visit in general. Looking at the building from the outside, you think there will be tons of cool things to look at and learn about inside... Granted it was a new building and maybe more exhibits and attractions have appeared since we've been there in January 2012"
,,Only for exhibitions,3.0,,"I went to visit a temporary exhibition (Warhol): it was very well presented, but the rest of the building was a waste of space a waste of time."
,,So So,3.0,,Beautiful architecture but the permanent collection is poor. It is a good idea to check if there is a specific event there before decide to go. The pictures outside the museum are better than inside.
,,entry ticket is not cheap,2.0,,half the exhibits were closed to public. not worth the price i paid for the entry. i did not like the short trio ... quick exit beacuse there was not much to see
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"The space is relatively small compared to National museum but this museum does gives visitor an exclusive feel. At the moment there aren't many exhibitions or the price can be higher but give it some time, more programs should be introduced. Great to bring your overseas guests to tour around MBS, ArtScience Museum and Helix Bridge."
,,Intriguing construction,3.0,,"Visited the museum and found it quite interesting.
Unfortunately the Andy Warhol exhibition had just finished, so only got to view the photo showcase. I enjoyed this and enjoyed my visit to the museum.
To me it was worth the $6 entry fee. It was interesting to learn a little bit more about this intriguing construction."
,,Quality depends on the exhibits,3.0,,"Visited the museum for the Harry Potter exhibition, which was pretty entertaining - the young ones especially enjoyed the Sorting done at the start of the tour. As a fan of the Harry Potter series, it was wonderful to see the scenes in the book fleshed out in real life.

The rest of the ArtScience Museum is interesting the first time, but don't plan on spending a whole day in there. 2-3 hours, including whatever exhibit you might have purchased tickets to, will suffice."
,,Hits and Misses,3.0,,"It really depends on what show is on... When the Andy Warhol show was on, I visited it 4 times and loved it every time. The previous show, the Dali exhibit, was awful! The space has its flaws but given its proximity to a number of good restaurants and its ease to find, I'd recommend it to tourists and Singaporeans alike. Just check to see what's showing first."
,,Wow,4.0,,"The Art Science Museum at Marina Bay Sands is very impressive during the day, but at night even better with the coloured lights. Very unusual shaped building."
,,Harry Potter: The Exhibition,4.0,,"Went for the Harry Potter exhibition on its last day. Bought tickets online with audio guide, so it was $30 per person.

The exhibits were interesting and the audio guide was really informative. While looking at the items, you can listen to the team narrate what were they thinking and how they came up with the items.

We took our time and went through the whole place in 2 hours. No photos were allowed which was a bummer and the souvenirs were so expensive! Before entering the exhibition, we took a photo with the scarves (managed by the employees there), but when we exited (2 hours later) the photos were not ready yet! So we left without buying our souvenir photo."
,,A specialty attraction: your interest in visiting will depend on the exhibtion they are displaying: tip- go by MRT,5.0,,"I visited the ArtScience Museum's Andy Warhol exhibition (running until October 2012).

On the day I visited, they also were offering a Harry Potter exhibition, which I didn't attend.

I thought the Andy Warhol exhibition was excellent- featuring 260 of his works. I thought it was a world class exhibition, and well worth visiting if you are interested in Warhol and the Pop Art genre.

Essentially, I suspect your interest in visiting will depend on the exhibitions they are displaying at the time!

At SGD 15, I thought the Warhol exhibition was excellent value.

The location is adjacent to the Marina Bay Sands complex and the new Botanic Park, so there are other attractions in the vicinity if you want ot make a day trip.

Also, you can get there by MRT- the Bayfront station on the Circle Line- you change trains at the Promenade MRT station."
,,Good shows,5.0,,This place gets pretty bad reviews in the guidebooks but we caught the Harry Potter Exhibition and Andy Warhol show which were both great. Pretty extortionate to get in but we thought it was worth it for these exhibitions as they were large scale and very interesting. A good place to spend a hot afternoon! The architecture of the building itself is incredible so no matter if you go in or not you must see it from the outside.
,,Harry Potter Exhibition,4.0,,"Very nice location, clean, easily accessible but rather crowded. The exibition halls are alittle too small in my view. Felt like we were rushed through to finish it quickly."
,,An impressive building and art space,3.0,,"An eye catching building. At the time of visit the exhibits were Andy Warhol and Harry Potter.

Only visited the Andy Warhol exhibit and felt privileged to experience the upper level gallery space in this building instead of the larger space below ground level. An interesting collection and great to see some of his well know prices as well as his lesser known work and the personal side of a great artist, photographer & film maker.

It will depend on what is on at the time if you should go but worth a visit from an architectural view from the outside definitely."
,,Fun but Can Get Expensive,4.0,,"I was here for the Harry Potter and Andy Warhol exhibition and in summary, I felt a bit disappointed after exiting the museum.

First, while marketed excellently, the Harry Potter exhibition was not worth the money spent. Sure there are some gems displayed there that were used during the filming of the series (for all we know they are just replicas) but they should have planned it much more since it felt like a 10 minute show. I was surprised myself when I saw that I was already heading to souvenir shops. If you're unlucky, you'll have tour groups with you so make sure to go there during non-peak hours. The Andy Warhol exhibit was equally great.

The building itself was cool. The design outside is amazing and inside is a very well maintained (it's fairly new, I think).

Over all, visit if the exhibit interests you. It is up to you to decide whether the fee would be deemed worthy."
,,Nice Museum and Fun Exhibits,4.0,,This is a great little art and science museum right on the Bay in Singapore. We went through the Harry Potter exhibit and the Andy Warhol exhibit in August. The kids enjoyed the Harry Potter one but my hubby and I were extremely impressed with the Andy Warhol exhibit. Quite an impressive display of his works and rather unexpected.
,,disappointment,1.0,,Nothing much on the harry potter exhitbition. not worth the money paid. less than 10 mins we are out of the museum. the commercial and the actual was so different. super disappointed!
,,A magnificent building but...,3.0,,"The building is magnificent and a must see in my opinion. However on the inside there isn't so much to see. I went there while they had the Andy Warhol and the Harry Potter exibitions.
I only saw the Andy Warhol one which was comprehensive and downright beautiful; I even got the exibition book which is very-very good. But other than that and the Harry Potter exibition there isn't much else to see apart for a couple of small exibitions on innovation (basically a film about the evolution of innovation). I would have expected more from an Art and Science Museum."
,,expensive admission charges but exhibits were great,3.0,,"we visited the museum when they had the Van Gogh exhibit. the admission charges were pricey but we enjoyed the place and the exhibition was very well done. sadly there is only a tiny cafe there. as we went there late morning and ended early afternoon, we had to head to town for lunch as the tiny cafe had miserable selection of food"
,,Enjoyable..,3.0,,"Being our first stop of our trip, we were naturally quite excited. Getting here by MRT was easy enough. The building is impressive & we spent a good 10 minutes just snapping away. Being a Friday, we had no problems getting our tickets to the Harry Potter & Andy Warhol exhibitions.

We started off with Harry Potter, which had a pretty dark setting. There was a fairly large display of props & wardrobe from the various installments. And, if you can't recall any of the items, there are TV monitors at almost all display areas showing clips where these items appeared. To echo the sentiments of other reviewers, merchandise at the souvenir shop was pricey. Still, die hard fan, I'm sure, would fork out the dough. On the whole, I'm sure big time fans would be all ""ga-ga"". Personally, despite enjoy all the HP movies, I was a wee bit disappointed.

Before heading for the Andy Warhol exhibition we stopped by the ArtScience Museum's souvenir shop. A well stocked place with a good mix of artsy & science-y souvenirs. And, it has corners to take 5 - nice touch.

The Andy Warhol exhibition, in contrast with HP, was all bright shocking pink & silver. It had a good display of artwork, art installation & audio visual. Very interesting indeed!

I came in all set for the HP exhibition & left with enjoying the AW one even more!"
,,"Stunning outside, average inside.",3.0,,"Went to the ArtScience museum with my two teenage boys and daughter aged 10 while the Harry Potter and Andy Warhol exhibitions were on. We cycled from the other side of the bay via Marina Barrage, very easy pleasant cycle. Ended up chaining the bikes to a fence under a nearby bridge where lots of other people had too. The ""Lotus"" design is structurally magnificent from the outside and the whole family was curious to see the interior.

We hadn't booked, but despite a long queue got tickets easily and quickly. To see both exhibits a combined adult ticket was S$28 which adds up when there are 4 adults to pay for! The child ticket was S$16. We got a free ticket by buying 6 cans of coke while we were waiting costing S$24, 5 cans were quickly consumed after a hot cycle!

Exhibits were very well done but the interior of the museum lacks daylight and wow factor which is a shame. If you're just visiting Singapore for a short time, enjoy the outside and save the ticket money for another attraction."
,,"Exhibition Space That Brings Together Art And Science, Media And Technology",4.0,,"Situated at the bay front near Marina Bay Sands, ArtScience Museum & Youth Olympic Park are twin tributes to the progress of Singapore on the world stage.

The Youth Olympic Park is a small area, commerating the inaugural Youth Olympic Games held in Singapore. The Youth Olympic Park is filled with pictorials, statues, and several story boards explaining the significance of the event. Generally, it'll only take about 10 minutes to walk around the whole Youth Olympic Park, and admission is free.

The Youth Olympic Park is connected to the ArtScience Museum by the Double Helix Bridge. An example of the science of engineering combined with the art of architecture design, the Double Helix Bridge is a unique visually appealing pedestrian bridge. The Double Helix Bridge is lit by coloured LEDs at night, and looks a lot more beautiful.

Just across from the Double Helix Bridge stands the ArtScience Museum. Shaped to look like a palm, with 10 fingers, the ArtScience Museum also boasts a sustainability feature in the Rain Oculus, which recycles collected rain water into the washrooms.

There is only 3 small permanent galleries at the ArtScience Museum, located on the 4th floor. The Curiosity Gallery challenges the notions of art and science, the Inspiration Gallery features outstanding ideas from history, and the Expression Gallery uses multi-media to showcase the innate creativity of people.

The rest of the galleries in the ArtScience Museum are normally rotating, temporary exhibitions. During my visit, the 2 temporary exhibitions were Harry Potter The Exhibition, and Andy Warhol 15 Mnutes Eternal.

Andy Warhol 15 Mnutes Eternal explores the personality of the man, his work, his ideas and the tools he used. Perfect for those seeking inspiration in art, or those who work with visual mediums.

Harry Potter The Exhibition showcases the collection of props and movie artifacts from all the Harry Potter movies, and is a great experience for fans of the series.

If you're planning a visit, do note that admission to the various exhibitions will cost around SGD $20 - $30, depending on the exhibition itself. The all-access pass option may be more worth it as a whole package. Allocate around 1 to 4 hours for viewing. Also, note that photography isn't allowed in most of the galleries, especially the temporary exhibitions."
,,Incredible museum,5.0,,High-tech museum..good for kidz...not bad for adults..I suggest you to take your children in 6 years above.
,,Impressive architecture and a great exhibition,4.0,,"We wanted to have a close up look at this most impressive building and discovered that both the Harry Potter and Andy Warhol exhibitions were on while we we there.
The building itself was worth seeing and the use of the "" arms "" of the structure as galleries to house exhibitions was inspired, in this case the Andy Warhol exhibition.
The Harry Potter exhibition in the basement was truly amazing and well worth the time and money for a visit. Even my wife who has never seen a Harry Potter film was fascinated."
,,Superb! Extraordinary!,4.0,,"Hey there! I m a top Harry Potter fan and so I went to the Harry Potter Exhibition in the Art Science Mueseum(i m a Singaporean!) So it was awesome! The staff there were friendly and we accidentally ordered an extra ticket they didnt go berserk or got annoyed and said sweetly that it maybe their mistake that they didnt hear us properly.. :) And the exhibition was just awesome! The staffs went an extra mile and explained to us about some of the soveneirs 'history'( not that I need it though my frend did). This is one of the best place in Singapore, and as a Singaporean, I will say that this is a MUST go tourist attraction for all foreigners!
Thanx! :)"
,,Nice Addition to Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"Visited for the first time to see the Andy Warhol and Harry Potter exhibits. The architecture of the building itself is worth seeing as well, and it's even nice to just sit outside either before or after seeing the inside exhibitions. The staff is friendly, and there are plenty around to help you / guide you through."
,,Hoping for more,3.0,,"The Art Science Museum is architecturally interesting, but fails to offer much more. I have visited several times, for Dali, Van Gogh, Warhol and Harry Potter, and each exhibition has left me wanting. The staff are not particularly helpful or friendly either."
,,Small but effective!,4.0,,"Although small compared to most museums, this interesting looking building generally offers wonderful visiting exhibitions and allows you to get very close to the exhibits too, which is great for an older lady with failing eyesight!"
,,Vwey Well Made,4.0,,"Pretty entrance - with a pond and the flowers... a good spot to meet friends, sit and chat and of course - catch the exhibits. I went for the Andy Warhol show - would have liked to see some of his MOST famous works - the gun, cow, etc."
,,disappointed,2.0,,poor storyline. the show should be more than just showing off technology
,,"Great architecture, not great interior design",3.0,,"It's a stunning building, very striking and very different (from the outside). On the inside, you walk around a circle with various exhibition rooms coming off it. It feels a bit cramped. A gallery should have huge spaces to give the larger artworks the space they deserve. The aircon is beyond freezing. Nobody needs to be this cold, even though it's hot outside. I wore a cardigan and couldn't wait to leave after an hour, even though I enjoyed the artworks."
,,Amazing building - HP exhibit a bit static,3.0,,"The ArtScience building is a wonderful design - reminiscent of the Sydney Opera House, combining usefulness and beauty. I saw both the Harry Potter and Andy Warhol exhibitions, buying a combined pass for $28. I thought this a little overpriced, particularly as there are no free exhibits in the building.

The Harry Potter exhibition is commercial as you would expect. I was convinced to buy an audio guide for $6. It had very little additional information, and the brief commentaries were quite banal. I wouldn't bother. The exhibit itself is very static - mostly artifacts and costumes and pieces of set. It is like a traditional museum - good for bookish children, but not terribly interesting for the hands-on types. I enjoyed it, but I am a grown man of 32!

The Andy Warhol exhibition was... and Andy Warhol exhibition. It had everything you would expect. I'm not sure that the design of the museum is helpful for works of the scale of some of Warhol's work. It is a series of small galleries, and it's hard to get a long range view of anything.

It's an interesting space, definitely worth a visit. But don't expect too much of it."
,,Love it!,5.0,,"Visited both the Harry Potter and the Andy Warhol exhibitions, which you must go if you have the chance. If you want to see both, get the all-access pass at the ticketing counter as it's only available there and not online.

If you don't want to pay through the nose for tickets, you might want to sign up for the Sands Rewards card to get 10% off ArtScience Museum tickets."
,,Lovely architecture and authentic exhibitions but ....,3.0,,"We went to the Harry Potter exhibitions first before proceeding to the Andy Warhol exhibits. Enjoyed ourselves thoroughly at the Harry Potter's as the displays were very life-like and authentic. We would have enjoyed ourselves at the Andy Warhol's exhibition as well and given the ArtScience Museum a 4 star rating if not for the rude female staff at one of the rooms with the free range silver balloons who hushed at my daughter who was at her best behaviour throughout the entire trip to the museum but in that moment giggled with excitement when she played with the balloons. Firstly that was an isolated room with no other exhibits around just the balloons so it's very understandable that any kid put in that room would be in awe and excited to play with the balloons a little bit. Which kid wouldn't.But the female staff was totally unprofessional and blunt to ""Shhh"" my daughter very loudly to cause her to cry as we took her out of the exhibit. In the first place most of the teenage staffs in the rest of the exhibits didn't care about what went on in the exhibits that they were put at and were busy chatting away blatantly in front of the visitors to the museum and behaving in an unprofessional manner. So why start now in this isolated room with the balloons with no other exhibits. This female staff who looks like a teenage intern is obviously targeting my innocent daughter simply because she dislike children and is irritated by a little noise. In the first place if the museum is so intolerant towards children then perhaps they should not admit children. But the fact is that they do let children enter the museum and at a cost no less it would be fair to treat them respectfully as individuals and not discriminate against them. I must emphasize that throughout our entire trip to the museum my daughter has not caused any disturbances or pandemonium in any of the exhibits.If innocent giggling during her play with the balloons at the isolated exhibit is considered a disturbance then by all means not allow children at all in the exhibits or remove the balloons at that exhibit because that will only entice any curious kid to play with it. Having said that, perhaps the museum should employ mature, tactful and responsible staffs and not teenagers as this would simply tarnish the reputation of ArtScience Museum. In my opinion, these teenage interns are causing more disturbances with their mindless chatters and giggles than my innocent daughter."
,,"Beautiful museum, good exhibitions, but ...",4.0,,"We enjoyed out trip to the museum, especially I loved Andy Warhol exhibition. However, staff doesn't care what goes on in the rooms, except the ticket counter, where I was attended in the most professional manner. Staff in Harry Potter exhibition was chatting, hanging out together and using phones. Some rooms are not supervised for a while so all the people around us took pictures with their phones and cameras. The atmosphere inside wasn't great at all because they tried secretly take pictures rather than enjoy the exhibition. And some girls even didn't hide their huge professional cameras! It was so annoying because I wouldn't mind to take some photos of my family having a nice day out. I wanted to buy so many things in the shop, but it was crowded and I couldn't move around with my kid in the buggy. And most of the times the staff was chatting (2-4 people), had no knowledge of what they sell and every single person around me was taking pictures in scarfs, hats, etc."
,,Enjoyable visit,4.0,,I had a few hours to pass so I headed to the ArtScience Museum and was pleasantly surprised by the displays. They had on both the Andy Warhol 15 Minutes Eternal and the Harry Potter exhibition. Both were really great displays and I'm keen to go and re-watch all the HP movies!! The architecture of the building itself is pretty spectacular and in the permanent exhibition you can learn a little about it's design and architect Moshe Safdie. There are 3 floors to explore and well worth going especially if there is an exhibition you are interested in!
,,A disappointing Harry Potter Exhibition at the ArtScience Museum,2.0,,"I went with my 10 year old daughter who is a big Harry Potter fan. It was very disappointing with very limited interactivity. There were lots of pieces from the movies, but very little to keep a 10 year old or 42 year old interested. It was disappointing that there was nothing to do besides look at some props from the movies. It would have been nice if the clothes were on models of the actors rather than just on headless dummies. It would have been nicer if we could have gotten some pictures with the characters (models would have ben enough). The whole exhibition took 30 minutes ending at the enevitable overpriced merchandising shop.

My daughter thought it was only ok.

I do hope to get back to the ArtMuseum later (the Andy Warhol exhibition looks interesing) in the future, but hope that the exhibition can match the building that hosts it."
,,Harry Potter exhibition - Good but annoying you can't take photos,2.0,,"I visited the ArtScience museum to go to the Harry Potter exhibition. I'm not the biggest Potter fan so I wasn't that excited about seeing all the props. I was more interested in getting cool photos, being a keen amateur photographer. As I approched the entrance there was a big sign saying "" photography and video recording is strictly forbidden. I couldn't believe this - the one thing I came to the exhibition to do was forbidden - unbelievable. Once in the exhibition I decided to ignore the various warnings about photography and took some covert photos. About half way through the exhibition I got caught doing it and a female member of staff requested that I deleted my photos. I deleted one and then she asked me to delete them all so I told her NO and walked off. She then called security who in turn confronted me and my friends and requested to check all our cameras or we would be thrown out. Luckily by this stage I had given my camera to another friend so they never found my photos.
I fully understand the staff of the museum were just doing their jobs and I must say they were very respectful and professional. My question is why are either the museum or Warner brothers enforcing this rule of no photography ? I can't see how they will lose anything from people taking photos, if anything allowing people to take photos would generate more publicity for the exhibition.
Apart from the issue I had with the photography, I enjoyed the exhibition. The quality of the props on show was very good and you could interact with some of the exhibits.
So overall a pretty good exhibition but be warned that they are very strict with photography and will throw you out if you get caught."
,,Fantastic outside design,5.0,,What sets this structure out is the unique design. The Inside still needs lots of improvement. I went here to see the Dali exhibit and the Van Gogh exhibit. I also find the cinema very modern. There are LCD touch screens here where you can make your own post card and send them to your loved ones. Overall an interesting stop while in Singapore. The structure is designed by Israeli-born architect and urban planner Moshe Safdie
,,Titanic Exhibition is something to see,5.0,,"I visited Titanic Exhibition. This was one of the best exhibitions I have ever seen. A lot of interactive exhibits and replicas of the decks, cabins and the grand staircase was good. The only thing I didn't like was that the person with camera offering you to have your photo taken on the grand staircase. I don't remember how much he asked for the photo.
If there is an interestin exhibition coming up, I want to visit again.
The light up of the building is quite beautiful. Recommended."
,,Titanic Exhibition,4.0,,It was pretty good and very interesting but the rude foreign tourists with no manners took the shine off it...
,,Warhol in Singers!!,5.0,,"$13SGD bought a ticket to te biggest exhibition of Warhol works - no queue, no crowds - a great experience (with bag check we were able to fit this in on our way to the airport with a baby) :-)"
,,Dont bother.,1.0,,Ther was no science the whole place was devoted to Andy Warhol who appered to a drug crazed nutter who thought high art was a line of cornflakes boxes and a photo of a soup tin !!
,,Fantastic Experience,5.0,,"Visiting the Andy Warhol 15 minutes experience, great place for a interesting museum."
,,Best enjoyed from the outside,2.0,,Disappointing & pricey. Best enjoyed for free from the exterior.
,,titanic exhibit.. phenomenal,5.0,,"My friends and I visited the titanic exhibit last nov 2011. There were replicas of the grand staircase and the first class cabin. The best area was the titanic viewing deck, there were stars, ocean waves and chilling temperature. it's as if you were really on the ocean - hair raising experience. The exhibit was well organized and it will give you a deeper understanding about the titanic."
,,the warhol exhibit was inspiring,5.0,,"we took some time to visit this museum because of the andy warhol exhibit. it was worth every minute and every dollar! the building itself was a pleasure to go through - the quirks of a great engineer!

the warhol exhibit was terrific! very extensive from his earliest work to the latest. including photos and films. we love the fact that singapore is a venue for these art events and we're looking forward to seeing more when we return"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This building is amazing. Andy Warhol is currently on display. beautiful - prints, photos. The display is well set up. Would go again"
,,Titanic Exhibition was great!,4.0,,"Visited the ArtScience Museum for the first time due to the Titanic Exhibition and I loved how organized the entrance is to get in and out of the museum.

The exhibition in particular was much more than I expected as it catered to all the 5 senses and gave a very in depth look and understanding about the Titanic.

Thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely be back to see another exhibit that interests me."
,,Titanic exhibit,4.0,,"The exhibit was amazing! Though short, but the display items will make you wonder how they were able to preserve such things even though it has been in the water for so long."
,,Amazingly hard work!,5.0,,"Wah! i didn't know that there is a museum here in a busy shopping centre! Here is my reflection:-

Our group of 9 people went to the Art Science Museum on 30th January 2012. It was the first time for me and the mental model that I had of the place was that it will be full of artifects on Science materials. My thoughts were wrong and the trip proved insightful.

First of all, the museum itself is part of Marina Bay Sands (MBS). Their budget comes from MBS and they run the museum privately and is not under the heritage board. Since the museum is privately theirs, they run on profit and loss.

What we found out was that the education department would try their best to think of how their activities are linked to Singapore's national curriculum and will cater the various activities to the needs of the school giving as much authentic experience as they can."
,,"Interesting ""Visiting"" Exhibit-Titanic",4.0,,"Wonderful display of ""Titanic"" artifacts and well laid out examples of ""life at sea"" on the ship 1912. Thank you to MBS ArtScience for bringing it to Singapore."
,,Titanic – Sailing Back,5.0,,"Being a fan of the movie makes you wonder what really happened, who were the passengers and how it impacted the people. Visiting the exhibit made someone appreciate more the real person and true story of those involved on the tragedy. That life is too...More"
,,Titanic and Andy Warhol,5.0,,Both exhibitions were excellent. Tip: get in early to avoid the crowds after lunch.

,,good learning experience for everybody,4.0,,"We went to the museum today, bringing along several minors aged 11 and below who don't know much about the historical relevance of Titanic. It was a worthwhile experience not just for them, but also for all the adults that joined. We got a boarding pass that represented someone who actually boarded the ship. Somewhere later at the exhibit, there is a wall that states the names of the people who survived and perished. You look for the name of the person stated in your boarding pass. You could see all the people staring at the board, looking for their names. In our group of 11, 2 were holding passes of people who perished, while the rest survived. Mine was a 15 year old girl who got married 50 days before the Titanic trip. Her new husband perished. I consciously looked for the husband's name at the board as well. The exhibit is tastefully done where you will get the feeling of being part of Titanic. How ironic that Captain Smith was set to retire for good after the Titanic maiden cruise. Wow.

Tip: We went there on a Saturday afternoon. The line to buy the ticket was long. And we were told there is a line downstairs to enter the exhibit also running around 2 hours! We decided to try our luck at around 7pm. The line to enter was much much better, maybe 30 minutes to enter, and the line to buy tickets was less than half that when we originally went. Considering there were not that much people when we went in, we still stayed inside the exhibit for over an hour, I think we lasted 1 hour and a half. I can only imagine how people can really enjoy it when there are much more people (like in the afternoon mentioned above)."
,,"Great building, great exibit!",5.0,,"We went along for the titanic exibit not really knowing anything about the museum. The lotus flower architecture is very striking.

The exibit itself was very well set out and seemed to go on for a long time. It was $24 each for this exibit only and we paid an extra $5 each for a documentary viewing and souvenir (a commemorative pin). The documentary was a little boring but all in all a really great exibit.

Worth a look from the outside even if you don't want to fork out the money for the exhibits."
,,Great exhibits,5.0,,"the exhibits while I was there (Titanic & Andy Warhol) were very well set out, interesting and interactive."
,,unexpected treasure,5.0,,Great space and exhibition. Did not read the guide books and found this great exhibition
,,Too much $$ for too little,2.0,,It is way too expensive for what you get. Better go to the Asian Civilization Museum.
,,Titanic exhibit - Average for the price.,3.0,,"We took our daughters (aged 6 & 8) to the exhibit, as the younger one is learning about the Titanic at school next term. For the entry fee ($24 adult, $14 kids) it was average.....had some interesting artifacts etc, but pretty boring for kids...in fact I'm not sure why kids should even have to pay, as there is nothing there for them to do. As my 8yr old said, she thought there would have been some interactive things they could of played with (like just about every other museum display has).

Something to do on a wet day, but certainly wouldn't be rushing to do it again."
,,Brilliant,4.0,,"This museum is great! The building has obviously become a landmark with its original architecture, but there is more to it. It hosts fantastic world-class exhibition (Dalhi, Cartier watches, Titanic, shipwreck..). The price is very reasonnable (about 30SGD to visit all current exhibitions), there is a small cafe, an interesting gift shop, very polite and helpful staff and if you go in the morning on week days, it is very peaceful.
The permanent exhibition is a bit disappointing and the building is not as interesting from the inside as it is, architecturally speaking, from the outside but the view from the lift is good."
,,Always interesting things to see in a well laid out atmosphere,5.0,,"Everytime something new comes to the ArtScience Museum we are there. The exhibitions are great, they are well planned to make you appreciated the subject matter even more!!"
,,Iconic Architecture,3.0,,"The structure is designed by Moshe Safdie. Looks good from the outside but internally it is very cramped. You have to keep shuffling between the different levels by lifts. I would still prefer the Louvre. Exhibitions are organised and chenged frequently so it will depend on what you are seeing.
Andy Warhol and Titanic were on during my visit. The Titanic exhibit is well done and can make you feel for the victims."
,,Emotional and Educational,5.0,,Go during a weekday where it is less crowded. Portion off at least 30 minutes to truely immerse yourself in the write ups and relive the life of a passenger on board. The real life artifacts reflects the mood of the set up but the success of this exhibition lies in the stories and messages that you read off the walls. They even re-created the Menu Of The Day during the unfortunate night of incident. Touch the man-made iceberg to feel what the drowning passengers held dearly onto. This is by far the best exhibition that ArtScience at MBS has held so far. Its worth every cent!
,,"Good Titanic Exhibit, Even Better Warhol",4.0,,"The ArtScience museum is an eye-catching lotus flower building and makes you want to visit it. Can imagine that would catch a lot of ppl's attention. The wait to buy the tickets is orderly but takes a bit of patience. Ask for a discount if you are staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It is not obviously displayed. The Titanic exhibit was interesting as it shows what the experience was like for the travellers. The most interesting part is that at the beginning of the exhibit, they give you a ticket for an actual passenger and you just can't help but check at the end whether ""you"" survived the voyage. Worth a visit. We were lucky that the Andy Warhol exhibit had just started when we visited and I thought it would be a small collection but it turned out to be the most extensive Andy Warhol exhibit I have seen. Well curated with his different periods in different rooms. Both were better than I expected. Well explained and good pieces. The outlets (gift shop, coffee shop) at the museum were fairly mediocre and the inside of the building not as spectacular as the outside; but the exhibits made it a worthy visit."
,,ArtScience Museum is Worth a Visit.,4.0,,"This landmark at the end of the Marina bay sands looks like a lotus flower. The unique shape of the building impacts the galleries inside, and gives the spaces are very interesting effect... it is definitely not a box. They have good drumbeat of installations, so check the web to see what is currently showing. I have enjoyed the Dali and Cartier exhibits in the last several months. The building is lit up at night during the light/water show at the Marina Bay Sands."
,,The Titanic exhibition,5.0,,"While I was in Singapore I managed to see the Titanic Exhibit.
If you can get there before the end of April (when it Closes).You must see this for yourself. The have recreated the Grand Staircase, First Class Cabin, Second Class cabin etc from Titanic and you get to walk through the rooms with music playing etc.They also Have a Large Iceberg which you can touch to let you get the feeling of How cold the Waters of the Atlantic was the night the Ship Sank. I found this Show very emotional. The museum also give you a Titanic boarding pass when you arrive and they encourage you to look on the wall at the end of the exhibit to see if you survived or perished.
I survived.. It cost approx $25 to enter this display. check what is on before you go as exhibits change."
,,"Expensive, unfriendly staff and totally waste of time",1.0,,"The lotus-shaped architecture looks fascinating. But, there was nothing inside. Do not waste your time and money. The entrance fee is 24 dolars per person. Currently, there is titanic artifact exhibition at the basement which makes this museum looks like a history museum than an art museum. The first floor was closed with unknown reason. For the second floor which was the upper floor, only half of the space was used for exhibition. Not suitable if you are traveling with small child or those who love art. We only spent one hour there. It was raining when we wanted to leave. As the buidling was located outside marinabay shopping mall, we asked for help from the staff. One particular staff was not helpful and told us to walked through the rain. Finally, they provided us with umbrellas."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We missed the Titanic Exhibition in Melbourne, so caught it at the ArtScience Museum. It was simply amazing. Kind of nice to visit just before the anniversary of the sinking as well. Made me want to come home and watch the DVD. Cant take photo's within the exhibition (which is normal for all the ones Ive been to in Sydney as well) but they do take your photo in the famous Leo/Kate pose on the front of the boat or on the grand staircase...well worth the S$20 for the photo. It was an experience I wont forget quickly. The sounds and also the drop in temperature as you walk through the exhibition really makes you feel like you are on the Titanic. Finding out whether you survived, via the boarding pass they give you at the start made it real - we both survived which was a relief!!

The ArtScience Museum itself is such a beautiful building, we went late for the tour and then stayed to watch the light show. The Museum is lite up beautifully, good photo opportunity."
,,An unexpected gem of a museum,5.0,,"What you get out of the visit really depends on what is currently touring but generally, the standard of curation is high so you can be assured of a good experience. Plus the building alone is worth a sightsee!"
,,The art gallery with no art,1.0,,"I visited the ArtScience Museum around 3 months after it first opened. Lovely impressive museum - the headline exhibition was Van Gogh Impressions. I went down expecting to see some lovely Van Gogh paintings, but all they had were prints and projected images of his work. it was the same story throughout the museum: not a single piece of original art !

I left the museum and asked to see the manager. He politely accepted my compaont but refused to refund my admission fee (around $50 for 2 people). I persisted and emailed a few people in the Marina Bay Sands organisation but to no avail.

Highly disappointing and to my mind a complete rip-off."
,,Loved the Titanic exhibition .. Don't miss it!,5.0,,"Took my kids aged 8 and 12 and they loved it. The exhibition itself was fabulous and the documentary whilst 1 hour long, still managed to keep my 8 year old entertained! I also thought it was excellent value for money. New exhibition starting soon is Andy Warhol..should also be interesting!"
,,Enchanting Educational Entertainment,4.0,,"My sister and I decided to go to this museum one spontaneous afternoon when she took her day off at work a day after her exhausting pre-wedding photo session. Since we had an appointment with a friend of ours later in the evening, we didn't really have much time to explore the whole museum; but to observe the current exhibition in the museum: TITANIC; The Artifact Exhibition. This exhibition is being held up until April 29th, 2012.

I have to admit, we were quite surprised at the ticketing. The exhibition cost twice (or more at some) regular museums in Singapore. A single entrance fee of SGD 20.00 has to be paid to get into the galleries.

No photo is allowed to be taken in any part of the exhibition at all.

When we first entered the TITANIC exhibition, a boarding pass was given to each of us. Each of the pass was different; referring to the passengers on board. And that boarding pass determined our identity throughout the journey. At the end of the exhibition, you can search for your name in a name list on the wall, to know whether the character you resemble survived.

The exhibition was neatly arranged and systematic; starting from how the sunk ""unsinkable"" was planned, built, decorated. It shows the artifacts found in the ship wrecks; including passenger's personal hygiene products, the utensils in the rooms provided, furniture (the remaining, most likely). It shows parts of the ship (rebuilt) so that we could walk through the corridors as it was before. It also shows how the fateful iceberg hit the ship and dramatically turned the magnificent cruise into a deadly disaster that took hundreds and thousands lives.

All in all, it was a pleasant, enchanting visit to the TITANIC exhibition at the ArtScience Museum with a bunch of new information I've never known before about the legendary ship."
,,Great Titanic exhibit in unique building,4.0,,"When we visited, the museum had a great Titanic exhibit. You were given a ticket and felt like you were walking through the ship. At the end you found out your fate as a passenger on the Titanic. The historic details were interesting as well."
,,Titanic Exhibition - it beats a night in the cold,4.0,,went there today with 4 kids under 12 - a really cracking couple of hours. exhibition is great and some really nice touches such as the Boarding Pass. Go back to The Shoppes for coffee and Ice Cream afterwards
,,Fantastic museum,4.0,,I went to the ArtScience museum to see the Salvador Dali exhibition. The museum is well designed and laid out. If you like fine art then make sure you visit this museum.
,,Very nice but expensive,4.0,,I went for the titanic collections and it is so nice but 20 dollars was a lot
,,Interesting detour from the casino,4.0,,We were mesmerized by the collection of exhibits culled from the sunken Titanic but the ticket price is a tad steep by Singapore standards. Great view of the Esplanada Theatres and the financial district from the promenade next to the Museum.
,,Must do if the main exhibit is of interest to you,4.0,,"Whilst the building is quite large, it is really only a few small levels in size. I visited whilst the Genghis Khan exhibit was on. This exhibit was very well presented and quite informative & educational. One highlight was the Mongolian band who performed many traditional tunes that were well worth spending 20-30 minutes experiencing."
,,Modern Lotus,3.0,,I love the lotus shaped design as it is unique and helps to soften the 'hard' look of surrounding buildings.
,,Good but highly dependant on current major exhibit,4.0,,"We visited this museum in mid-2011 and the temporary major exhibit was Shipwrecked: Tang Treasures and Monsoon Winds which was well curated and presented with a large number of interesting Tang dynasty artefacts from the Belitung shipwreck.

However the permanent exhibits were only of brief interest to us. Hopefully these are improved with time so that the museum is worth repeat visits without reliance on major exhibitions."
,,Excellent Titanic exhibition!,5.0,,"Hailing from Belfast, this exhibition was a source of surprise and intrigue when we stumbled upon the museum while visiting Marina Bay Sands.
The exhibition didn't disappoint. There was detailed background info about the ship
and the Harland and Wolff shipyard. The artifacts were wonderful. Great effort and details went into creating the grand staircase, berths and the walking deck. The 'iceberg' was a nice touch.
Just hope that the 100th anniversary exhibition of the Titanic in Belfast in the newly built Titanic building in April will be just as excellent!!"
,,Good exhibitons,4.0,,We saw some great exhibitions by Dali. The Museum it self looks very cool and the exhibition was very well displayed.
,,Press your palms against the freezing iceberg!,5.0,,"Great story, told chronologically, and accompanied by good music. They have recreated the rich carpeted halls, the saloons, the staircase (was not soo impressive). Loved the recreation of the sea floor with shimmering lights and the Titanic treasures strewn in the sand. Terrific. Well worth the 24 dollars."
,,Art & Science - The best of both worlds,4.0,,"I visited the museum when the Dali exhibition was on and when the Van Gogh exhibition was on and I must admit, it was pretty mindblowing. The mix between art and science is incredibly interesting and the layout of the building itself is unique. The Van Gogh exhibition gave me a great impression of the place for a first time visit, especially the size of the space they laid it out on. The projections of his paintings against the walls was indeed a beautiful example of what kind of works can be displayed at the ArtScience Museum and what they're capable of in the future! Can't wait to go back and see the next exhibition - Titanic!"
,,Salvador Dali/Van Gogh exhibition - awesome experience!,4.0,,"A wonderful place, we visited one of the exhibitions there and were totally impressed. also, it can make for a perfect Sunday, to go there, then dinner, followed by a late night at the casino! So much to do there"
,,Titanic Exhibition - worth the visit,5.0,,"Visited to see the Titanic Exhibition, and it was well worth it. Well laid out and relatively inexpensive compared to exhibitions in some countries. The exhibition provided great deal on information (some well known and some relatively obscure), artifacts and tangible participative exhibits."
,,Experience Titanic,4.0,,"A nice presentaion of the facts and artifacts of Titanic. Background music was appropriate to bring visitors to the setting and create a feel. The artifacts were well presented and provided an idea who was on Titanic, the lifestyle on the ship, crew's uniform, old coins and purse. It felt interactive and at the end of the visit, an educational journey."
,,Titanic Artifact Exhibition - just magnificent!,5.0,,"This exhibition contains an exceptional amount of detail, and gives enough information to entertain the curiosity of those new to the Titanic, and also those who are very familiar with her story.

There are two opportunities throughout the exhibition for professional photos to be taken - once on the bow of the ship, and the other on the grand staircase.

Parts of the ship have also been reconstructed - including the B deck, the side of the ship, the grand staircase, cabins of the various classes, the steerage walkways, and the temperature of the ice.

An absolute must-see!"
,,Titanic Exhibition is superb!,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to have been there at a quiet time (opening time) and had most of the exhibit rooms to ourselves. The exhibition is incredibly well laid out. Each visitor is given a 'boarding card' on arrival with the details of a passenger. Before you exit, you examine the list of survivors and those lost to learn which category your passenger fit into.

There are a number of personal stories scattered throughout the exhibit, which gives a real feel for the human tragedy of the sinking. The grand staircase and ice (a real novelty in Singapore) were a particular hit with the children. The one hour documentary is also worth seeing as out adds a new dimension to the exhibition."
,,Well presented exibitions,4.0,,Titanic and Cartier. Little bit too much always for me. In the end I could not grasp everything anymore. Otherwise excellent.
,,Go!,5.0,,"We went to see the Titanic touring exhibition which it needs to be pointed out, we had already seen in Atlanta and were impressed by. Rather we had seen the same artefacts in Atlanta, and there the exhibition similarity ended. This was a different exhibition entirely and both adults and kids were drawn in to the story of the sinking of the Titanic by the mastery and imagination do the curators of the ArtScience Museum. They went to such measure which including creating a seabed, and ""rebuilding"" parts of the titanic, cabins, decks, staircases, dining room including food smells. There was even a real scaled down iceberg for people to touch! All of this was done by the museum and made the exhibition a joy to attend. Staff are helpful and this exhibition needs more than an hour to be enjoyed thoroughly!"
,,I don't like it,2.0,,"I think this museum needs serious people to manage the exhibitions. I went to the Van Gogh show and it was an utter disappointment (just slides shows projected onto the walls). Even in the Dali show recently, there were some mistakes on the labels. Quite terrible for a museum which claims to be ""international""."
,,Disappointing artefacts!,2.0,,"Titanic exhibit is good and takes back to the that era. Exhibition is very well curated with a feel of cruise ship.

However, permanent exhibits are big disappointment. Thay are at only one level (out of 4 levels). Do not see any art or science in them. Normally, these type of museums allow you to experience real life science scenarios. But nothing of that sort in here. Not at all worth the time or money. I think, they are just trying to encash the design of the museum, which of course is good. But that's it.

Watch it from outside...avoid purchasing tickets."
,,Great exhibition of the Titanic,4.0,,"The exhibition on the Titanic is great value for money, costing just S$24 per person. Can tell that there's alot of effort that went into putting the exhibition together with the many articles displayed as well as the staging. My wife and I enjoyed this very much."
,,Titanic and Dali Expo,4.0,,"Another Titanic expo? sounds boring... but No!! worth seeing! great documentary film about exploring the wreck of Titanic. Real objects from the ship. Great Idea with Boarding passes and checking if the passenger actually survived.
Dali was nice too, although over already. Interesting especially for people who are not museum/gallery lovers. No discount for SQ boarding pass travelers :( Would come back !"
,,Titanic,5.0,,Good visit. The Titanic Experience was the reason for the visit and worth the three hours
,,its more a gallery than a museum,4.0,,"quite small to be named a museum, but nonetheless, worth a visit: great location, nice architecture and I was lucky enough to catch a Salvador Dali exhibition which, needless to say, it was awesome"
,,Poor quality of exhibits - like cast offs from better museums in Beijing and Shanghai,1.0,,"I visited the Van Gogh Exhibit and Shipwreck exhibits and was badly disappointed. The porcelain bowls in the shipwreck exhibits were poorly labelled and unprepossessing, ordinary pieces. The Van Gogh exhibit had no original paintings at all and was a ripoff. Cheap 2D projections of his work on the walls coupled with music. I have had reviews from friends that the Terracotta Warriors exhibit was equally lacklustre. The permanent exhibition are a few hanging dioramas on the ceiling, don't bother visiting.

Having visited the Shanghai National Museum (which is free!), and seen the majestic pottery, stoneware, and bronzeware on display, I would say check that out when you visit China, and save your time and money in Singapore for the National Museum and the Peranakan Museum. The National Museum has a great display of South East Asian artifacts. I hope Marina Bay Sands will bring in higher quality exhibits with actual relics, for example the Pixar Exhibit, if they continue to charge such exorbitant rates."
,,interesting looking gallery,4.0,,"This art gallery marks the interesting Singapore modern day nightview landmark along with the nearby Marina Bay Sands complex empire. Its exotic and charismatic appearance attracts most people from the first glance, though architecture inside is not as impressive as the outside appears to eyes. The place has overall 4 floors to which only two upper floors are used to be gallery space, seems very small and you only take 1-2 hours max to walk around the place even lingering at each artwork provided as a case. This museum is not included in the S$20 3day pass for 8 museums around town. The fee is approximaly S$10-15, not too bad for me. Unless they got an interesting Exhibition inside, I would say I enjoyed the outside view better. Fortunately they got Salvador Dali shown during my visit which made it equally amazing altogether in my opinion."
,,Good exhibitions,3.0,,"We saw the Dali and Van Gogh exhibitions at this museum which were fantastic. The 'permanent exhibition' floorspace at the top is not worth the entry price so check what exhibitions are on before you go.
A good option for a wet day in Singapore, combined with the adjacent Marina Bay Sands shops.
Great architecture."
,,Hasn't achieved its potential yet,3.0,,"The ArtScience Museum is housed in the stunning new, lotus-flower shaped building at Marina Bay. The building itself is a great feature in the bay cityscape. Unfortunately, you don't get any sense of the building once inside it. There are few views to the outside from inside, unless you peek behind the closed blinds.

The core content of the 'museum' (as at Oct 2011) is desperately lacking. The top floor seems to house what would be considered a 'permanent collection' but they have little to show - only what appears to be science-inspired three-dimensional dangling art. Maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea, and admittedly I didn't spend long contemplating the top floor.

After three minutes we went down one floor to the temporary exhibition space where a Dali exhibition is currently on display. We enjoyed the Dali immensely. A good selection of 3D sculpture, quite an interesting virtual curtain of moisture to walk through, with a image of Dali displayed on it, and lots and lots of 2D work from Dali. Sketches, paintings, studies - all packed with fascinating insights.

The Dali exhibition was very enjoyable indeed, and more than made up for the disappointing floor above."
,,Van gogh exhibition amazing as was Dali art and bronzes,5.0,,Last day of van gogh - so fortunate to have caught it. Opening hours also great 10 to 10 every day
,,Minor irritations detract from superb exhibits,3.0,,"This museum was only recently opened. Its modern eye catching architecture and location, along Singapore's skyline provides ample opportunities for photography.
Our visit in August coincided with special exhibitions featuring the works of Salvador Dali and Van Gogh. The exhibitions themselves are superb, however minor irritations detract from what could have been a world class museum.
-Entry to the special exhibitions is charged separately from general admission to the museum. Unfortunately in my opinion, the general exhibits aren't really substantial enough to justify the admission prices.
-Be warned that the ticket you paid for the special exhibits is per entry only. The staff took great care to warn us that we would not be allowed in again once we left the exhibit area. Unfortunately, there are no toilets in the exhibit area. When I had to visit the toilet, a guard gruffly told me that I would not be allowed in again. I was amazed that at an exhibition of this standing there were no toilet facilities or access to toilet facilities once in the exhibit area! Its not very practical to take your time at the exhibits given this entry ticket policy.
- Customer service varies - the counter staff and gift shop staff were friendly and courteous. Security guards could be more polite - at one point I felt like I was being scolded when asked about the entry policy.

Despite, these minor irritations, I'd say the museum is was well worth the visit due to the special exhibitions."
,,Look from the outside -- inside not really a tourist attraction,3.0,,"The building's weird structure can be seen from the outside. On the inside, there is nothing architectually special (it looks like a normal building, and you can walk in a circle, just like most museums where you can walk through without having to circle back).

If I was a tourist or if I had to bring my friends here, would they absolutely need to see this place? They could see it from a boat tour, or walk on the DNA bridge to see the outside. The inside -- well it's all about the exhibits. I was lucky enough to go see the Dali and Van Gogh exhibits. Dali was a special experience that inspired me. I love Van Gogh and enjoyed being immersed in his artwork -- BUT The prices are steep. I would only go if you're really interested in the exhibits they're showing. If you're a tourist and the exhibits sound meh -- then skip it.

One exhibit is $15, 2 exhibits $24, and 3 exhibits $30. So if you see Dali for $15, but then add on $9 for Van Gogh -- well Van Gogh was like a 15 minute immersion movie and I'm not sure if that's worth it. I would rather watch a movie at that price. (and I love Van Gogh.)

All of the museums in Europe are like Neiman Marcus stores. A lot of high-quality art. This art-science museum is like a single Louis Vuitton store. Ultra-expensive with few choices, so only go if you're sure you're interested in the exhibit."
,,Even the kids enjoyed it!,4.0,,"This is our second visit, to see the Dali, Van Gogh exhibition. Our first visit was to see the Genghis Khan exhibit.

Overall the exhibits were very good, I was told that the Van Gogh exhibit had very few actual paintings so I was not disappointed when we went. (If I had not known, I would definitely had been disappointed!). My 8 year old enjoyed the Dali exhibit.

Agree with the previous reviewers about the price being a bit high but do ask the person attending to you if there are any discounts and there is usually something available. We are locals and hence providing local ID/Driving licence will give you a discount.

The building itself is interesting both inside and outside. There are always tourists/people lounging around the water feature outside the building. Do walk around as the view is quite good.

I found the one time entry to the exhibit to be a bit inconvenient as I have an infant with me and when she started crying I had no choice but to go out. I think people should be allowed to go in again if they so wish, especially after having paid for the entrance.

Overall, we enjoyed the exhibits and the place. We would go back there again for other exhibits."
,,"Good exhibits, excessive cost, arrogant back office",3.0,,"Good exhibits - Tang shipwreck, Dali, Van Gogh. These are traveling exhibits; no permanent collection.

Building is dramatic and intriguing from outside, not super-functional inside.

Pricing is unrealistic and arrogant - US$30 per adult.

Backoffice is arrogant and unhelpful, they neglected to reply to my four emails requesting additional information/meeting with executives.

The Singapore government insisted that in order for Marina Bay to get the casino license, they also had to construct something of perceived social value, hence the museum. Marina Bay makes a bundle with the casino and hotel. Perhaps that's the problem, the museum is run by people whose first priority is running a casino/hotel, not a museum. Missing a bit of heart."
,,(ALMOST) Singapore's Best Museum,3.0,,"The ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands is, in summary, a missed opportunity to turn itself into a world class museum. It has everything going for it – from the architecture to the ample installation space, from the collection to the location. The ArtScience Museum was built to be the kind of museums that Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) and Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It was meant to be that way, of course, but it never managed to live up to its aspirations.

My interest for the ArtScience Museum was first tickled when I heard about the Salvador Dali exhibition in the newspaper. Since we are both museum enthusiasts, we decided to visit the ArtScience Museum for that exhibition alone. You can imagine our delight when we found out that the entrance ticket ($30 per person, with an ongoing promotion for OCBC cardholders) allowed us to visit all three exhibitions that were going on at that time. It was a Sunday when we visited, and there was hardly a crowd in and around the museum, truth be told. At any rate, we were attended to by a friendly employee at the lobby called Jeffry, who explained to us the promotions, the packages as well as the various exhibitions in the museum. His explanations were clear and concise, which made the ticket purchase process a real treat.

Our first exhibition was a documentary about Salvador Dali and his art, located on the top floor of the museum. The documentary was a little long, and there were parts where Dali's accent made it difficult for the audience to understand. The shortage of benches and the length of the documentary drove a handful of visitors away prematurely. However, my girlfriend and I stuck it out till the very end. Even though it was overly long and, at times, somewhat confusing, the documentary is clearly the best way to start your journey into the mind of a genius.

Next, we visited the Salvador Dali exhibition itself, located on the third floor. The installation was amazing, with great lightings, music and effects to accompany the paintings and the sculptures. Unfortunately, because we started with this particular installation, everything else after that in the museum paled in comparison. I must say that the Salvador Dali exhibition is definitely one of the best installations in Singapore that I've ever had the pleasure to visit. Even though Dali's most famous painting (The Persistence of Time) was absent from the museum, the massive collection of his other works more than made up for it. I truly enjoyed the bronze sculptures, and the lightings were carefully calibrated and adjusted to bring out the best in his artwork. The descriptions of his artwork were ample and easy to read, even though I felt that some of the paintings could have had more information provided. Another thing to comment about the exhibition is that it was much larger than what I am used to in Singapore. The arrangements were great, and it was conducive for visitors to flow from one room to the other without causing a massive human traffic jam. All and all, the title of the exhibition, Mind of a Genius, is truly worthwhile.

We moved on to the Vincent Van Gogh exhibition in the basement this time. I must say that, after having visited the MOMA, this exhibition was a disappointment on a biblical scale. Instead of exhibiting Van Gogh's art, you see giant blown up images of his work being projected onto the walls, with loud classical music being blasted through hidden speakers in dark corners. That is pretty much what the entire installation is: a large, empty room with pretty images on the walls and loud music. At the end of the exhibition is a corner with short profiles of Van Gogh's work (Not the actual work, again). The descriptions found here can easily be searched via Wikipedia, or other more capable online sources. The purpose of this exhibition confused me, to be honest, and it is not the kind of exhibition that you will find in other countries, especially the more famous ones. It felt like the museum was using Van Gogh's work to showcase how awesome their projection technology is. In truth, with this particular exhibition, they not only failed to impress the visitors, they clearly missed the mark.

The Shipwrecked: Tang Treasures and Monsoon Winds exhibition was marginally better. At least with this exhibition, you got to see actual relics and artifacts in the glass shelves and windows. The trouble with this exhibit is that the venue seems to be way too large, which caused the exhibits to be far apart from each other. This gave a sparse, empty feeling that worked against the exhibition. While it was certainly an eye opener to see some of the artifacts, it still paled in comparison with the Salvador Dali exhibition.

All and all, this has been a very difficult attraction to review. On one hand, I was thoroughly impressed and blown away by the Salvador Dali exhibition. On the other, the other two exhibitions did not seem like they should belong to a world class museum. Or, at least, a museum that is aiming to be a world class one anyway. The ArtScience Museum, with its amazing architecture, vast exhibition venues and professional staff, has all the potentials in the world to become a great museum. Yet, they really need to take care of the kind of exhibits that are displayed. Also, I disliked the fact that the entrance ticket only allowed for one entrance.

In summary, while the Salvador Dali exhibition was amazing, $30 for the entrance ticket just wasn't worth it at all. I'd pay $20 just for the Salvador Dali exhibition alone. My recommendation? Use your OCBC card, take advantage of the promotion, go to the Salvador Dali exhibit and skip EVERYTHING ELSE."
,,Super architecture and great exhibits,5.0,,"Entrance fee pays for all exhibitions on at the time. Worth coming just to see the lotus shaped building and the rain oculus (collects rain water for recycling).
Dali, VanGogh and Sunken Treasures were on during our visit. Loved the Dali sculptures and quotes. The projection of VanGogh paintings onto the walls was also an interesting way to show off his art."
,,Art Science Museum was amazing,4.0,,"I totally enjoyed the Dali exhibition, the Vincent Van Gogh exhibition was very different it was presented in a comtempory fashion. I had a big day of walking so it was refreshing to sit, and fun to be surrounded by Gogh and his images. Great value as entrance included 3 exhibitions. As I said the Dali exhibit was fantastic lots to see and learn."
,,Art Science Museum at Marina Bay not quite ready for prime time,3.0,,Overall not worth the money. No readmission to the museum and no food inside. They only have a few snacks in the basement. There is no way to get in from the Marina Bay mall without going outside which is a mess if it is raining or very hot. The temporary Van Gogh exhibit has no original paintings only projected images. There was some things for kids to do so that was a plus.
,,Marina Bay Sands Art Science Museum,1.0,,"This is one of the most souless museum experiences I've ever had - and I’ve been to many all around the world. It's all fluff, minimal content and quite expensive. Very little bang for you buck. The Van Gogh Alive exhibition is absolutely dreadful (large projections on walls and music) and the permanent galleries have very little to see (again more projections). Go for a walk around the complex instead as the exterior is amazing."
